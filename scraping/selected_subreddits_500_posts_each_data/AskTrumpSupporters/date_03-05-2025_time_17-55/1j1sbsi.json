            "body": "I disagree.\n\nThe goal needs to be getting our European partners to match the US' strength and capabilities so the US can take a junior role in European defense, especially now that Russia is depleted by Ukraine. It made sense for the US to have the greater burden of European defense post-WWII when most the continent was recovering or adjusting from WWII and the USSR was an economic and industrial titan. In 2025 it doesn't make sense for most our NATO allies to not be able to maintain their own reserves in their AO, or for only the UK and France to have force projection capability that is a fraction of what the US can do.\n\nWe should probably also be eyeing Australia, Japan and South Korea for future military partnership emphasis. The European theater is no longer the center of the world. The Asian Pacific theater is where the next major conflict is going to take place and we'd be better off strengthening our alliance with our partners there. I'd like to see Australia improve its force projection capacity.",

In order to get the US to leave the Asian Pacific to China they'd have to offer the type of deal that any president with common sense would consider.\n\nEven if the strategic necessity to defend Taiwan didn't exist, the US still wouldn't want to give China control over a major economic zone where a massive amount of global trade flows.\n\nChina has a dedicated intent to replace the US as a hegemon in Asia. They don't want to make a deal with the US because making a deal wouldn't get them where they want to be.\n\nCommon sense also tells us that Trump is aggressive on China. He would probably jockey for beneficial trade deals with our allies but he recognizes the need to keep China from expanding.\n\nThe intelligent thing for any ally of ours that is Trump-skeptic is to play the game and not act like it's a shock every time he tries to benefit the US in a deal with a partner.",

Our allies and partners should be viewing our interactions in the lens of \"what's in it for the US?\" We've been providing that security umbrella for generations at our cost, often to our detriment.\n\nTake Turkey as an example. It's a dictatorship, that was only ever quasi democratic and its NATO membership was purely to give us a front close to Russia. The result is that they've been an unreliable ally that has been developing closer ties to Russia, has territorial disputes with Greece who is also a NATO partner, put us in a very delicate position in Syria regarding our partnership with Kurdish forces against ISIS and frankly has a lot of American asking \"Why? Why are we doing this?\"\n\nIn the case of Europe I see no reason why Americans need to take the lead on Ukraine when the EU is right there with a more significant security concern in regards to Russia. That's Trump's whole point. Why are we carrying the majority of the burden when there's nothing being offered to us at the end of the path but Europe doesn't have to when they have the clearest benefit from Ukrainian security?",

The Memorandum was a promise to not attack Ukraine, not use economic pressure on Ukraine, and advocate for Ukraine in the event it were attack. Sending them weapons or military assistance is not a requirement. \n\n> What message do you think this sends the rest of the world with respect to the United States as a reliable ally?\n\nI'm getting a little frustrated at this because I've been clear in my opinion and so has the Trump administration. \n\nThe signal to the world is that the US isn't the global piggy bank or shield. The EU needs to develop their own militaries to reduce the burden on the US to provide for European security. South Korea and Australia need to do the same.\n\nOur European NATO partners have been behaved as the junior partners in our mutual defense when the EU has a GDP equal to the US. There's no reason they cannot match the US commitment to our mutual defense. Instead they've outsourced much of that commitment to the US and the US hasn't gotten much in the way of tangible benefit from it.\n\nIt's not 1950 when the US is holding up western Europe Weekend At Bernie's style in the face of the Warsaw Pact. It's 2025. The EU economy is nearly as big as the US and yet their collective defense is much weaker. That's nonsensical.\n\nAustralia can't match the US defense commitment but they can at least acknowledge the need for US protection through favorable agreement with the US. Same with the Phillipines and South Korea. Why does Japan, a nation that has a constitutional prohibition on war, have a stronger military than Australia who has been a military partner of the US for generations? Can the US at least get something out of the deal if we have to take the majority responsibility for Australian defense?\n\nThat's the Trump foreign policy agenda. \n\n> Do you think this is a good thing to have allies question?\n\nFrankly, yes. Our allies have been our worst friends.\n\nThe Canadian military is in tatters. Its barely deployable, has aging equipment, is tiny and underfunded. Consider it has the longest coastline in the world and is surrounded by 3 seas but has 15 surface combatants in its navy.\n\nSpain made deals with the Taliban in Afghanistan to avoid combat, something that shocked the USMC forces that relieved Spanish troops.\n\nGermany has long ignored its military and has sent troops to joint training without weapons or night vision, refused to send tanks to Afghanistan for fear of making the mission too high profile and Rheinmettall revealed that a significant amount of stored Bundeswehr equipment in 2022 was unsuitable to send to Ukraine because it needed a year of refit to be usable.\n\nFrance was the first nation to leave NATO joint military command and spent most the Cold War uncommitted to sending troops to Germany and had no forward deployed units in NATO. Currently they have 400 Leclerc MBTs and no ability to make more.\n\nBritain has been a close ally but they have regularly slashed defense spending and their military leadership has been clear they would last a couple weeks in war with Russia. They had to get their bombers out of the trash heap and delay the retirement of an aircraft carrier to fight the Falklands War.\n\nSo on and so on.\n\nThe bottom line is it no longer makes sense for the US to be footing the bill for our collective defense. We should be allowed to expect our allies to step up or find the US giving them only as good as they've given. \n\nIt's not absurd for the US to say that Europe should be taking the lead in Ukraine because they have the immediate concern, anymore than it was for the US to make Europe take the lead in Libyan intervention.",

China is only growing in power. India is not far behind and will one day seek to be a regional military power. North Korea is strengthening itself through cooperation with Russia and Iran is a menace in the middle east.\n\nThe United States does not have the resources to single handedly maintain global stability as it has for the last 70 years. Trump is pressuring our allies to increase their commitment to defense, or else create economic incentives for the US to maintain a security interest in our alliances or else face a world where the US cannot safeguard Europe and the Pacific at no cost to the defended.\n\nChevron benefiting economically does not recompense the cost of providing a security bubble across the Pacific ocean, nor does it negate the need to ensure defense commitments are shared equally among the committed.\n\nFrankly, any world leader that sees the US reputation as tarnished or unreliable because we are restructuring our defense commitments is short sighted and foolish. After nearly a century the geopolitical landscape had changed and our strategic concerns with it. The ANZUS Treaty was signed in 1951. Back then communist China was not an industrialized nation or a nuclear power and the USSR was the biggest threat to the western world. Things have changed dramatically and now that Australia appears to be on the frontline of a future conflict with China, it's reasonable for the US to want to renegotiate the terms of our defense pact to make it strategically sustainable long term.\n\nLook at this way: New Zealand and Australia cooperate very closely in military affairs. Their defense force numbers less than 20k men. In any real conflict there's no question that New Zealand will enjoy greater benefits of protection from its security partners than it could ever provide. I'm not asking how that is fair, I'm asking how is that sustainable or strategically sound for either the US or Australia for any reason other than it's the nice thing to do?",

A NATO member buying weapons systems, especially surface to air missile systems, from Russia is ludicrous. It killed the F-35 transfer to Turkey because we couldn't risk Russia getting access to intelligence information on the platform and led to the US imposing sanctions on Turkey. A NATO member.

By 2013, frustrated with delays, Turkey signed a deal to buy missile systems from China, which strained relations with NATO.\n\nLater that year, as the Syrian conflict escalated, NATO deployed Patriot batteries in Turkey to protect against potential threats. However, by 2015, they were withdrawn, with NATO stating that the immediate missile threat had diminished. Turkey saw this as the alliance failing to uphold its security commitments.\n\nBy 2017, Turkey cited continued U.S. delays in finalizing a Patriot deal as a reason for purchasing the Russian S-400 system instead. At the last minute, the U.S. made an offer, but it lacked the favorable financing and technology transfer that Russia had included.\n\nAt the end of the day, Erdogan did what Erdogan does - he played both sides, trying to leverage NATO and Russia against each other to get the best deal. But he miscalculated badly and didn\u2019t anticipate the severe backlash, including Turkey\u2019s removal from the F-35 program and U.S. sanctions as you mentioned.\n\nThis transactional approach - treating alliances as short-term deals rather than long-term partnerships - is something we now see reflected in Trump\u2019s foreign policy rhetoric. Like Erdogan, Trump argues that the U.S. should only support allies if there\u2019s a direct cost-benefit advantage. The problem? When you reduce alliances to mere transactions, partners stop seeing you as reliable - and they start making contingency plans.\n\nDo you think it's reasonable to say that if Trump follows the same path, the U.S. might find itself on the receiving end of the same treatment it once gave Turkey?",

Our NATO partner who we are committed to defend to the point of nuclear war treated the alliance as transactional. That's hardly a reliable ally when you consider the US has carried the majority burden of the alliance. You can't frame the NATO relationship in any other way than that the US has been the principle enforcement arm, and our partners have been beneficiaries of the mutual security umbrella.\n\nThat's the whole point.\n\nThe US isn't saying \"pay us for your defense\". The US is saying either match our commitment or, if you can't or won't, give us something to make it worth the risk and cost to the US. We get nothing from, say, Estonia or Latvia or Lithuania relative to the investment of coming to their aid if they are attacked. They benefit greatly from the security umbrella against Russia but given that they can't match the strength of their larger partners shouldn't those larger partners get something other than added liability out of the deal?\n\n> Do you think it's reasonable to say that if Trump follows the same path, the U.S. might find itself on the receiving end of the same treatment it once gave Turkey?\n\nIf our allies view an equitable arrangement between our nations as the US providing the security and its allies benefitting from it with no expectation of matching or compensating for that security then it would prove Trump's point that NATO in its current form is not in the US' best interest.",

Would you agree that the idea of the U.S. getting \"nothing\" from defending smaller allies ignores the immense strategic and economic advantages that come from maintaining global stability? NATO isn\u2019t charity - it\u2019s a tool of American dominance, allowing the U.S. to dictate global security policy, maintain military bases worldwide, and ensure that when conflicts arise, it doesn\u2019t have to act alone. Given this, doesn\u2019t it make sense that the U.S. benefits just as much, if not more, from NATO as its smaller allies do?\n\nWould you also agree that the U.S. economy thrives because of the stability its military guarantees? European and Asian allies rely on American defense, but in return, they trade in U.S. dollars, buy American weapons, and reinforce U.S. influence in global affairs. Isn\u2019t this exactly what has kept the U.S. at the center of the world economy, ensuring its continued dominance?\n\nIf Trump takes a purely transactional approach to NATO, what stops allies from seeking alternatives? We already see France and Germany discussing independent European defense initiatives, and the more the U.S. signals that it sees NATO as a burden, the more other nations will look for ways to reduce their dependence on it. Isn\u2019t this exactly what happened when Erdogan played both sides between NATO and Russia? Turkey lost trust, lost access to key military programs, and saw its influence diminish. If Trump treats NATO the same way, what makes you think the U.S. won\u2019t face similar consequences - not because allies are freeloaders, but because they\u2019ll start planning for a future where they can\u2019t rely on the U.S. anymore?\n\nTrump certainly has more leverage than Erdogan did in these matters, but what makes you think this radical shift in stance won\u2019t push allies away or force them to reconsider their commitments to the U.S.? Even if they comply with Trump\u2019s demands, isn\u2019t he still undermining his government\u2019s own influence in the process?",

However, Europe does need to get in board with contributing to their own defense. If Russia/China tries to make a huge land grab, they will be the first line of defense. They cannot rely on the US for the first response. In my mind, a NATO where all countries contribute equally is far more fearsome than one that hides behind the US.",

Yet when the U.S. asked them to simply meet their agreed-upon obligations, they acted as if we're traitors.\n\n* The United States has disproportionately funded Europe\u2019s defense, while European countries put their own security at risk\u2014weakening their militaries, indulging in cheap Russian gas, and gutting their energy security (which NATO itself flagged as Russian [subversion](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/20/russias-quiet-war-against-european-fracking/)).  \n\n* And when the U.S. repeatedly [pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5MJEMHZZsI) the absurdity of this, European leaders [laughed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfJv9QYrlwg) and [played dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CvQmWoog18). Yet they still call America \"compromised by Russia,\" lol.  \n\n* Europe strangles its own tech sector while placing enormous fines on American companies and [threatening](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-thierry-breton-letter-social-media/) U.S. CEOs.  \n\n* While the U.S. upholds free speech as a fundamental right, Europe increasingly embraces speech [authoritarianism](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/policing-speech-online-germany-60-minutes-transcript/) and demands that American companies [comply](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-removing-end-to-end-cloud-encryption-feature-uk-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-02-21/).  \n\n* A majority of Germans said they [wouldn\u2019t support defending NATO allies in a Russian conflict](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/majority-of-germans-wouldnt-support-defending-nato-allies-in-russia-conflict/). After a century of American-led reconstruction, defense, and goodwill, Europe doesn\u2019t even pretend it would reciprocate.  \n\n* European governments push green policies that cripple their industries and raise energy costs, then turn around and buy energy from the very nations they claim to oppose. Meanwhile, they lecture the U.S. about climate while relying on American exports to keep their lights on.  \n\n* Economically, Europe is stagnant\u2014zero growth, aging populations, and industries that can\u2019t compete without protectionism, even from [each other](https://www.ft.com/content/13a830ce-071a-477f-864c-e499ce9e6065). Yet they scoff at the American economy while relying on U.S. innovation, financial markets, and consumers to keep them afloat.  \n\n* Culturally, Europe sneers at Americans while its own societies become lifeless, self-loathing, and demoralized. Europeans mock American patriotism but seem to have almost negative pride and structural disdain in their own nations. They openly despise Christianity while mass-importing Islam and bending over backward to accommodate it.  \n\nThis isn't an alliance\u2014it's a hostage situation. And Trump is somehow the only one negotiating with half of America inexplicably taking Europe's side. \n\nIt's reminiscent of how Gen Z boys have been relentlessly flagellated for privilege\u2014yet their entire existence has been the media, academia, and workplace institutionally skewed against them\u2014but they're expected to pedestalize everyone else\u2014or be branded Nazis. It's the same exact playbook down to the Nazi rhetoric. \n\nAmericans are starting to ask for mere *reciprocity* from Europe almost a century after reconstruction (due to Europe's self inflicted destruction). Reciprocity at this point should be table stakes for \"friends\". Especially a wealthy one with massive resources. Yet they're having an absolute tantrum. \n\nAll I hear are the same unpersuasive, self-righteous, outdated boomer talking points. Maybe that worked on boomers. But I won't vote for my families' lives to die for ingrates. Especially not after how the EU is behaving now. NS, I have no beef with you sending your sons to take back Donetsk right now. They are taking volunteers. \n\nWhen someone is used to being coddled, reciprocity feels like an attack. But it\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s just long overdue. At some point they can start acting reciprocal or this one-sided relationship has to end.",

Also the USA tariffs EU goods. Here's some facts.\n\n[https://think.ing.com/articles/eu-us-trade-strategy/](https://think.ing.com/articles/eu-us-trade-strategy/)\n\n>European nations have consistently underspent on NATO commitments\u2014even after a decade that saw two Russian invasions. Yet when the U.S. asked them to simply meet their agreed-upon obligations, they acted as if we're traitors.\n\nOn the 2014 NATO summit an agreement was reached to up the spending. For the current year it looks like only 6 countries aren't going to meet those requirements. If your idea of \"asking\"  is showing up here with a very insulting set of lies at a security conference and then hinting like a mobster that everyone should spent 5% except the USA that message isn't going down well\n\n>The United States has disproportionately funded Europe\u2019s defense, while European countries put their own security at risk\u2014weakening their militaries, indulging in cheap Russian gas, and gutting their energy security (which NATO itself flagged as Russian\u00a0[subversion](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/20/russias-quiet-war-against-european-fracking/)).\n\n  \nI'll grant you the energy thing, that's stupid. The rest.. we rode the peace dividend wave, some of us a little too long. But we weren't invading and destabilizing countries around the world.\n\n>Europe strangles its own tech sector while placing enormous fines on American companies and\u00a0[threatening](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-thierry-breton-letter-social-media/)\u00a0U.S. CEOs.\n\nOK, that's just some baseless accusation. \n\n>While the U.S. upholds free speech as a fundamental right, Europe increasingly embraces speech\u00a0[authoritarianism](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/policing-speech-online-germany-60-minutes-transcript/)\u00a0and demands that American companies\u00a0[comply](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-removing-end-to-end-cloud-encryption-feature-uk-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-02-21/).\n\nAnd more.  We have this weird idea that if you want to do business here you play by local rules.\n\n>  \nA majority of Germans said they\u00a0[wouldn\u2019t support defending NATO allies in a Russian conflict](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/majority-of-germans-wouldnt-support-defending-nato-allies-in-russia-conflict/). After a century of American-led reconstruction, defense, and goodwill, Europe doesn\u2019t even pretend it would reciprocate.\n\nFirst of all, that's a 2017 article. Secondly.. as a country that was the ONLY ONE EVER TO INVOKE ARTICLE 5 I really don't think you should discuss reciprocity\n\n>Economically, Europe is stagnant\u2014zero growth, aging populations, and industries that can\u2019t compete without protectionism, even from\u00a0[each other](https://www.ft.com/content/13a830ce-071a-477f-864c-e499ce9e6065). Yet they scoff at the American economy while relying on U.S. innovation, financial markets, and consumers to keep them afloat.\n\nWTF does this have to do with a defense alliance? Also, yet again not entirely true, there's a little growth\n\n>  \nCulturally, Europe sneers at Americans while its own societies become lifeless, self-loathing, and demoralized. Europeans mock American patriotism but seem to have almost negative pride and structural disdain in their own nations. They openly despise Christianity while mass-importing Islam and bending over backward to accommodate it.\n\nAnd America wants to go full christo-Taliban. What's wrong with cultural differences? Or religious freedom (wasn't that in your constitution?) \n\nAlso.. most of europe is in front of the USA where it counts\n\n[https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/happiness/](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/happiness/)",

Furthermore, the first line states \"European approval of NATO is on the rise, according to a US study\" and seven of the eight countries surveyed had majority support for NATO itself.

For obvious reasons there's no bases in China, Russia, India, Brasil, even Vietnam. I wouldn't be surprised if we have some still in Iraq and Afghanistan. No American President will ever just give them up. They make things like war, trade, and influence on the global stage much easier. As with any empire, like the Romans at some point we could get overextended. Then China, Russia, etc. might try to fill that gap. This is basically what Trump wants with Panama and Greenland. We already have a military base on Greenland by the way.\u00a0",

I'm not sure why you want to use Obama's Russia policy as a measuring stick for Trump? Especially when, and I'm in awe it is the reality, the current path struggles to pass it *after* a reality check on Russian power?\n\nAs for \"if Europe cared so much\" - yup, serious mistakes were made, in greed and na\u00efvet\u00e9. Some NATO members have been upset about it for decades, not just US. But again, why step away now as things are improving within the alliance, rather than decade ago when it was much more decadent?\n\nBuilding alliances is hard work and unless US doesn't plan to return to MENA theatre in the next few decades, if not centuries, it'd be cheaper to keep it on a backburner rather than throw away. Especially since US had to give so little concessions and got so much say when the current one was built? My take is that unless US seriously has decided to remove their interest from Europe and its surroundings, this looks something akin to Brexit (although with much better local position). And even if leaving NATO is a wise move, is it wise to sour relations that much whilst doing it?",

Just the interest\u2026\n\nImagine if the interest on your credit card debt exceeded your rent or mortgage payment. And in 1 year it exceeded your rent/mortgage + utilities. And within the decade it was going to exceed all the income you make in a year, because that\u2019s how compounding interest works. \n\nHow would you feel about paying for your timeshare vacation rental in another country? Would that be important? \n\nWe are literally in a house on fire fucking crisis moment, and it bothers me to no end that democracts refuse to acknowledge this, or they try to handwave the problem away by saying things like, \u201clet\u2019s just tax the billionaires!\u201d Or they invent some bullshit economic theory like MMT to say absurd things like, \u201cthe U.S. can never go bankrupt because our debt is in USD, so we can just print more USD to pay for our USD debt\u201d. \n\nFirst of all, there are not nearly enough billionaires to pay off our debt obligations, even if you straight seized all of their bank accounts. Second, on a more practical level, how exactly are we going to tax these individuals that have unlimited accounting and financial resources? What mechanism do democrats propose that can\u2019t easily and legally be avoided by moving their permanent residence and/or corporate headquarters to another country? \n\nThere are only 3 ways out of the hole we have dug ourselves into. We need to grow the GDP by doing a bunch of shit that\u2019s going to feel really icky to do honestly, like drill for more oil and gas, mine more minerals, and reduce regulations to make it easier to do business in America and manufacture products here. \n\nWe need to dramatically cut spending all the way to the bone, that means no, we don\u2019t need overseas bases and we shouldn\u2019t give a shit about soft power or whatever.  The only two places where diplomacy and soft power matter imho are in the Democratic Republic of Congo where 70% of the Cobalt in the world is mined, a mineral required for lithium-ion batteries and Taiwan where 80% of the overall computer chips and 100% of the next-gen computer chips are manufactured.  Losing access to either of those territories will fuck our GDP goals.\n\nThe 3rd is that we need to raise taxes\u2026for everyone. And we need to raise them to levels that are going to fucking hurt for everyone. It is what it is, it\u2019s going to be a tough pill to swallow, but it will be easier to swallow if we can show that the government isn\u2019t squandering 80% of the tax dollars they receive.\n\nI didn\u2019t want Trump as a president, i would kill for another Obama or Bill Clinton.  But that person that actually cares about the debt and/or being pro-business doesn\u2019t exist in the Democractic party, so now we\u2019re stuck with this clown show in the Republican Party.  But at least they\u2019re trying to address one of the points I made above as far as government spending.",

All they had to do was increase their defense spending, embrace free speech, embrace democracy, and accept the various valid criticisms the American people have for these international alliances. \n\nInstead they've shown that they see the USA as little more than a piggy bank and bodyguard they can use to enrich themselves and hide behind when things gets tough. The second that we disagree, they have nothing but vitriol and disrespect. We're not the leader of the free world and I don't think we have been for years. We're tools. An international global elite has used the US as a mercenary group to plunder the world with one hand while raiding the wallets of our citizens with the other.\n\nSeeing them rally behind Zelensky after that clown blatantly disrespected our country has really opened my eyes and changed my perspective.\n\nWe should withdraw from Europe. They keep threatening us, saying that if we leave them they'll make a deal with China.\n\nPerhaps they've never considered the possibility of the USA, Russia, and China forming a new geopolitical and economic alliance and locking them out. It's clear the USA is alone in the world in terms of its values, once your country jails you for speech or they ban a political party they're no different from China or Russia imo.\n\nAs much as they're screaming about how ashamed they are of us, I can confirm that the feeling is mutual.

To-date, I believe the US is the only country to have invoked Article 5.\n3. Ability of all participants to maintain safe defense levels with reduced spending.\n4.

To-date, I believe the US is the only country to have invoked Article 5.\n\nDidn't we still have the vast majority of troops active after 9/11 in Afghanistan though? It's probably due to Europe's lower defense spending across the board, but personally I'd place much higher trust in American soldiers than NATO soldiers in general. \n\n>Ability of all participants to maintain safe defense levels with reduced spending.\n\nNATO countries still haven't met their spending goals. \n\n>A deterrent for any inviting between member nations.\n\nAny inviting? wym? \n\n>Deterrence against global beligerrants from attacking any NATO members and the resulting death or economic effects.\n\nI don't think anyone wants to go to war with the US any time in the near future- and it's not because we're a NATO member.

You live under conditions similar to the third reich. There is no POlNT in preventing an authoriterian government from coming to power if you have to become and authoriterian government to do that.\n\n\\>Russia threatened other bordering countries to not join NATO.

Do you still think we should friends with them?\n\nl think we have as much reason to be \"friends\" with him as we do the european union under there currently laws.\n\nWith the EU's hate speech laws there is no meaningful difference between them and Russia to me.\n\nl'm not fan of Putin cracking down on free speech or Europe.",
