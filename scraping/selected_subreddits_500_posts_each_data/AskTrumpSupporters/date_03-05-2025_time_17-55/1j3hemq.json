She also allegedly now requires anti-psychotics due to her time in solitary for over a week with no bed, blanket, or pillow.\n\nAs a German American, I find it highly disturbing that potentially my family members or friends visiting from Germany could be treated in this way, *depending on their point of entry*",

That being said a general rule would be when his policies are put into place and had time to take effect. That time will understandably differ, but for things like border security we saw a drastic difference within weeks.\n\nThat being said, she clearly was violating her travel visa by working, what cbp should have done was sat her in the airport to wait for the next flight home with an open seat and barred her from entry for X months or years.",

Having her tattoo equipment with her would rise to the level of a preponderance of evidence, as you dont travel with work equipment for fun.  If she bought it in the states then sure, she has an argument but that wasnt mentioned in the article at all.\n\n>Finally, if you think it's 'different on different cases', do you think the stock marking taking an utter shit is on Trump and his policies?\n\nYes, most likely in response to the tariff discussions.  Of the 3% over the past 5 days its already recovered 1% back.  I dont expect it to be a long term drop, nor would I call it \"taking an utter shit\", its a drop but not in the bankers jump off a building sense.",

There is no statement from DHS/ICE/CBP in the news article - they said \"ICE did not respond\", but knowing how the left wing media works - they probably asked ICE 1 hour before the story got published - while the leadership and staff were still going through a somewhat hostile transition.\n\nIf they *didn't* search you and only searched Mexicans then they would get sued for discrimination, no?

A detention is not the same thing as an arrest.\n\nWhen you get pulled over for a traffic stop, as soon as those lights flash on you are being lawfully detained. You are at that time not free to leave until the end of the stop, but you are not under arrest.\n\nThere are various rules governing the length of detention, usually it should be <72 hours but on the extreme end it can stretch indefinitely like with the 9/11 terrorists still in Gitmo.\n\nFact of the matter is that foreigners do not have a **right** to visit the USA. It's a conditional privilege that can be revoked at will by the authorities.\n\nSo like I said, they can lawfully detain someone at the port of entry until transport home can be arranged. The problem is that hasn't happened in a timely manner. \n\nMaybe it's a question of where to send her? If I had to speculate she probably would have wanted release back to Mexico where she's staying for the winter, but the Mexican government is probably refusing to accept deportees of non-Mexican nationality. Could be someone was originally trying to do a favor and get a waiver for release into Mexico and it got stuck in some queue.",

Employment is specifically forbidden under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) because it only covers activities that would be covered by a B1/B2 visa. \n\nArtists, journalists, etc. require a specific visa and if they are not visiting for tourism/business purpose then they cannot enter without one. So, if a German musician or comedian wanted to enter as a tourist - they could do that - the immigration officer can run a quick search and see that they do not have any shows scheduled in America during their stay.  Now this tattoo artist basically had her \"tour dates\" posted on her bio and had tattoo equipment in her luggage...what do you think that implies?  \n\n\nLook up \"American wanting to Tattoo in Germany\" on Google. The first 3 Reddit links mentioned requiring a work permit and an educational course (Ausbildung) as requirements for the American tattoo artist touring in Germany.   \n\nDo you think Germany would allow American tattoo artists with a similar case to enter the country just because they say they're a tourist? Both countries have the same policy - self employed people, artists, etc. require a special visa.",

That is exactly how the world works.    \n\nI understand the the Democrats have stuffed activist judges into the judiciary, but the fact is that this distinction for self-employed people, aka artists, actually protects the very people against Trump (i.e., actors and all of the liberal humanities professions you can imagine). SAG-AFTRA is one of the most protectionist unions out there. They do not want liberals to be replaced; only rednecks.  So I do not believe activist judges will allow a ruling essentially forcing the CBP/ICE to allow very obviously self-employed people without a visa into the country (without any investment at least).  \n\n> as she might use her Instagram to organise seeing friends or giving tattoos to friends for free\n\nCBP has the authority to check your electronic devices without warrant at port of entry (except in NY). They have found job related emails which resulted in deportations. I believe these people are experienced at sniffing out bullshit. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the \"friend\" of the tattoo artist, who went and cried to the media, is an LA business owner (some weird occult designer boutique) - who may or may not have worked with this \"friend\" in an employment-like capacity. Even if you ignore the tattoo work, a business owner closely working with a foreign national on a visitor visa is another cause for concern.     \n\n> Regardless, doesn't this seem unnecessarily harsh to you- particularly at a time when our European allies, of which Germany has been a very staunch one, are rethinking their relationships with us? Should we be doing things that are likely to decrease tourism or visiting to the States?\n\nLook up \"American wanting to Tattoo in Germany\" on Google. The first 3 Reddit links mentioned requiring a work permit and an educational course (Ausbildung) as requirements for the American tattoo artist touring in Germany. (I can't link other subs on this one)  \n\nDo you think Germany would allow American tattoo artists with a similar case to enter the country just because they say they're a tourist? Both countries have the same policy - self employed people, artists, etc. require a special visa.\n\nAs for the detention and slow deportation - I'm concerned about keeping anybody jailed for a minute longer than required on taxpayer dime. However, the only sources breaking stories about such border incidents are far-left outlets which I do not trust.   \n\nI am trying to reach some people in the admin to suggest launching a rapid response X account for ICE/CBP/DHS to properly investigate counter stories exactly like this one in a similar fashion to their White House or DoD Rapid Response accounts.\n\nThat particular facility has some outrageous, unbelievable accusations, all seemingly starting from 2018 when Soros started funding such astroturfing. But if such incidents are not just propaganda then I'd like for the alleged human rights abuses to be rectified. Too bad they come from known astroturfing sources.",

And that is absurd. \n\nThe problem is that there are material differences. Photography is a facet of tourism, tattooing people is not. The vast majority of people taking photographs are amateurs, not paid photographers working, whereas the majority of people tattooing are indeed paid and professionals. Literally everyone takes pictures. The percent of the population that has given people tattoos is going to be in single digits. No I'm not citing a source, use your brain.",

This is a very important distinction, because legal protections are *completely* different when crossing the border. US citizens lose 4th amendment protections - CBP can search your person, your luggage, your phone, and your laptop without a warrant. Don't want to give them your phone password? They can and will confiscate it.\n\nRights for foreign nationals are even more limited. CBP doesn't need proof of wrongdoing, they don't even need to prove reasonable suspicion. They have broad authority to detain and deport foreign nationals immediately for whatever reason they decide to make up.\n\nThis isn't a Trump directive - this is the way that CBP has operated for decades.\n\n>Do you think she should have been held for a month over this?\n\nNo, and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that CBP and/or ICE fucked this up and kept her in detention for far longer than she should have been in there.\n\nCBP is staffed by some of the most incompetent people in the federal government, and the San Ysidro port of entry is particularly bad. \n\nI've crossed at that checkpoint at least 40 times and every time I marvel at how breathtakingly dumb federal employees can be. The whole agency needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.",

What specifically under the description of [\u201cConducting Business\u201d](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/business.html) under this program, is illegal btw?\n\nSo, since the lawful and legal program she was entering the United States through has nothing to do with non-immigrant visas or applying for them (this is typically done by non-member country citizens for tourism either at the embassy in their home country or via an online portal), how does what you pasted above apply here? \n\nFor more clarity it may be helpful to Refer to this:\n\nhttps://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/requirements-immigrant-and-nonimmigrant-visas\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\n**Non-Immigrant Visa**\nNonimmigrant visas are issued to foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States on a temporary basis for tourism, business, medical treatment *and certain types of temporary work*. The type of nonimmigrant visa needed is defined by immigration law, and related to the purpose of the travel. Generally, an individual applies directly to the U.S. consulate or embassy abroad for a tourist (B-2) or business nonimmigrant (B-1) visa. However, foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States to study or work may require certain authorization and documentation prior to applying for a nonimmigrant visa. For an alphabetical listing all of the nonimmigrant visa classifications and specific requirements refer to the USCIS website. or the U.S. Department of State website.\n\nIssuance of a visa does not guarantee entry to the United States. **A visa simply indicates that a U.S. consular officer at an American embassy or consulate has reviewed the application and that officer has determined that the individual is eligible to enter the country for a specific purpose** (*note: this is when an applicant would need to convince the officer they are not intending to violate their visa*). The CBP Officer at the port-of-entry will conduct an inspection to determine if the individual is eligible for admission under U.S. **immigration law** (*note: the cbp office is law enforcement and must follow the law, including the constitution which applies to all persons in the united states, not just citizens*).\n\n**Visa Free Travel** (*note: the vwp, and esta, are VISA FREE travel, no visa at all, so no non-immigrant visa naturally*)\nU.S. policy permits citizens of certain countries as identified below to travel to the United States without a visa. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) permits nationals from designated countries to apply for admission to the United States for 90 days or less as nonimmigrant visitors for business or pleasure *without first obtaining a U.S. nonimmigrant visa*.\n\nAt the time of application for admission, a VWP applicant must:\n\nBe in possession of a round-trip ticket that will transport the individual out of the United States to any other foreign port or place as long as the trip does not terminate in contiguous territory or an ; except that the round trip ticket may transport the traveler to contiguous territory or an , if the traveler is a resident of the country of destination or if arriving at a land border, provide evidence of financial solvency and a domicile abroad to which the traveler intends to return;\n\nBe arriving on designated carrier that is signatory to a Visa Waiver Program Agreement, if applicable;\nHave a machine-readable passport valid for 6 months beyond the period of intended stay, or essentially 9 months (90 days + 6 months). The Department of State's 6-month list extending the validity of certain foreign passports can be found on the Department of State website. (A traveler with an expired passport is ineligible for VWP admission); and,\nComplete an Arrival/Departure Form I-94W. Travelers arriving at a land border will be required to pay the required Form I-94W processing fee.\nIn addition, VWP visitors may not file an application to change status to an immigrant or another nonimmigrant classification or extend their stay beyond the 90-day timeframe. VWP applicants waive their right to proceedings before an Immigration Judge, unless they make an asylum application.\n\nBased on the law and how it applies to this situation specifically (not a case involving a non-immigrant visa), what makes holding this person, without any facts in evidence, habeas corpus, or due process, legal?",

The jury did not find Trump liable for rape, but did for sexual abuse, a form of sexual assault under civil law. Does this count?\n\n1993 Harth sued him for sexual assault but withdrew the case after settling out of court. This still counts as being charged, right? He was charged for sexual assault until it was withdrawn.\n\nSame thing with the case of pseudonymous [Katie Johnson ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnib-OORRRo)in 2016. The case was withdrawn but still, he got charged, right? Not convicted, but he was charged for sexually assaulting a child, until it was withdrawn.\n\nDoesn't this mean he was charged with sexual assault?\n\nTo me the [document case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)) seems a bit more complicated than that. Biden and Pence immediately returned the records and cooperated with efforts to search for additional documents and thus weren't charged.\u00a0Trump stalled for months, then returned some of them, upon court order returned a couple more and then lied that it was all he had, but still they found 13 000 documents remaining at his place, 300 of them classified, some of them top secret. Do you consider this to be standard practice every president goes through after leaving the office? Surely it can't be negligence if he put in the effort of trying to hide the docs from the feds with Butler after he was ordered to return them?\n\nThere has been [quite a few cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictments_against_Donald_Trump) against him, but for most of them the Teflon Don slipped out of masterfully. I think he would be in jail now for the documents if he wouldn't have won. For a long time.\n\nLike the Mysterious Zebra said, it seems like Trump supporters only stand for law and order when it's against the opponents but don't care or even celebrate when their own are handed some \"get out of jail free\" card. Violence against police, is it always ok? Or only when attacking capitol after being lead to believe the [election was stolen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs)?",

Likewise, US customs officers can see when those trying to cross have had visas rejected by other countries or refused at the border.\n\nDepending on the situation, the US can & will also ban people from being granted any visas for a period of time- usually 3-5 years.

As such, there is no \"company\" for the government to enforce the work permit rules with fines and penalties. The law was written to shift the burden on the employer but self-employed artists are both in this case. \n\nI'm just talking from a \"common sense\" standpoint as a self employed person, not an immigration lawyer though. \n\nSome countries WANT such people to obtain residency and have introduced \"digital nomad\" visas, but the US is not one of them, and even if such a visa WAS introduced, I doubt artists would be covered by that.   \n\nThe lack of a company employing them is why artists and self employed people face additional scrutiny and have to work with talent agencies to carefully plan their \"tours\" whether it be comedians or singers.  \n\nWe don't know what caused the situation to escalate to a detention or a delay in deportation in this case - every additional day without deportation is on taxpayer dime so I would like swift justice - but if they lied to an immigration officer or had the intention of committing a crime then they can be criminally charged and held. That's where being tough on the law comes in.\n\nImagine all of Broadway and all the little comedy clubs being dominated by only foreign actors and comedians asking for half the rate - not good for the country - these protections were enacted long back - see how SAG-AFTRA operates.

However, I suspect we'll get more information that something more than that is involved.\n\n\\>If another country detains a US citizen without charging them with a crime,\n\nPretty sure you can be a citizen in the US and held more than 3 days without being formally charged. Further- what's the penalty for lying about your visa reasoning? I don't know.\n\nAnd as far as I can tell- we're only getting one side so, I discount what I'm hearing for now.",

Customs has a huge amount of authority to do things that you can't ordinarily do if a citizen is just walking down the street. We also don't know their reasoning behind this, so my suspicion is that OP's question and the other posts I've seen is an attempt to astroturf some pressure in her favor.\n\nIf the question is just whether or not this is 'good' or 'proportionate'- well that's a subjective matter, not really one of the law.\n\nIf the embassy's not doing anything visible then it's probably not a big enough deal to bother with, implying they don't have any particular reason to protest.\n\nOne could just as well be unhappy with the state of Thai prisons where people are in deplorable conditions for having a tiny amount of drugs, couldn't we?\n\nDoes Cuba still have the death penalty for having possession of drugs? The Chats say 'yes' but it's not typically used any more for possession. Are we all unhappy about that?",

I provided the Instagram (after cross checking the dates and names - which you can do too) - after visiting the profile, do you think she was \"just a tourist\"? Do you feel that the news article in the OP gives you the full story about her reason for travel?\n2. Based on the answer of the above question, do you think the news article would give you the full story about her detention?\n3. I googled \"American wanting to Tattoo in Germany\" and the first 3 Reddit links mentioned requiring a work permit and an educational course (Ausbildung) as requirements for the American tattoo artist touring in Germany. Do you think Germany would allow them to enter the country just because they say they're a tourist?  \n\nI don't think the reason for the long detention and solitary (supposedly) is being correctly reported by the media, given that they went on with the \"just a tourist\" point peddled by her friend when it took me exactly 25 seconds to google her name, find the Instagram profile on the first page and match the travel dates with the dates mentioned in her bio.\n\nGiven the disturbing images in her Instagram - they might have very well seen a human bathing in fake blood (supposedly) in her gallery - or self harm - or other such things, as the officers have the authority to do so at ports of entry. If she refused to cooperate - and became violent - off to solitary she goes.  It does seem longer than necessary - not because I really sympathize with this person (especially after the fake media propaganda) but because that's 24 days of her living on taxpayer money. Should have been deported to Germany the next day. I hope they had a good reason though! Maybe chat logs with Mexican cartel members wanting full body tattoos?\n\nAgain, I don't know, and I'm not sure ANYONE knows because the media is simply not interested in reporting the truth.",

I'm not surprised that this random tattoo artist story was picked up by the media because of the campaign to shut this detention center down and to hurt the US economy by hindering tourism.  \n\nWhat's concerning to me is that the only sources of these claims are far left sources which have lost all credibility upon me - and this 9 days claim is yet another one on the list.   \n\nI have asked a couple of right wing/centrist sources to investigate whether the far left organizations like the ACLU, PHR or media orgs like Atlantic/LA Times are genuinely reporting abuses or not. A recent example of the far-left covering for criminals : The Innocence Project made Biden [pardon a convicted murderer](https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/biden-peeler-bridgeport-killer-clemency-blumenthal-20048813.php), which even caused some Democrats to be concerned - simply because the Biden admin did not check the list provided by TIP.    \n\nI cannot comment on whether the solitary for the tattoo artist was fair or not - because the only media sources are the ones I don't trust and are mixed with poor reporting. Because if you leave it up to far left media - all prisons would look like the luxury hotels they kept migrants in NYC - and basically there would be no imprisonment (except for conservatives).  \n\nAll I know is that 9 days is well within the 15 day legal limit of solitary confinement implemented in the most far-left states like NY and it is far lower than the average at that facility.
