There are already several federal agencies that police fraud related to securities, banks, etc.  Those agencies and their laws should be consolidated to the FTC.\n\nB) This is yet another \"independent\" agency that is allowed to interpret the scope of its own power as it sees fit.  \n\nC)  Specifically, the CFPB usurps the market bey setting terms and prices,  going beyond its namesake of merely protecting against fraud.",
