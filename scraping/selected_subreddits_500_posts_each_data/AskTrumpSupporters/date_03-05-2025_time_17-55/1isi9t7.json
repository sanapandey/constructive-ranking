    "selftext": "At the moment, Congress is being Congress and failing to agree on a budget. \n\nAny budget that can pass the senate, can't get a majority in the house without democratic votes. \n\nMembers of the freedom caucus want large budget cuts, but this can't pass the senate. \n\nWhat outcome would you like? Pursuing the freedom caucus route will lead to a shutdown. Would you welcome this? \n\nOr would you like a deal with the dems? If so, what are your red lines, what would you be willing to work on? Do you think the dems should work with Mike johnson to get a budget passed?",

Teachers and students aren't feeling 90 billion reach their level. It divides out to $1700 or so per k-12, and the teachers in my family could spend that so much better than the government. Somehow it all gets lost in admin fees and probably corruption. DoE would've been my first target for DOGE.\n\nWhile I wouldn't cut capabilities from the military, those contracts need serious review. Billions to contractors that overcharge and under-deliver, if they deliver at all. Keep the people, guns, and maintenance. Scrap bogus \"development\".",
