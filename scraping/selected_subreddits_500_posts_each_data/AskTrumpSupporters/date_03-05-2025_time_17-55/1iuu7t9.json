I dont think hillary was terrible per say.\n\n2020 yes.\n\nTrump was and is no saint but watching the media and liberal left go insane taking the things he says so extremely out of context just sends red flags to my brain. The propaganda is scary to me because I do believe that type of propaganda is what made the nazis and we have seen the result of this propaganda over the course of years. 2x assasination attempts on trump.\n\nSome of the big instances that really swung my support to him was the jan 6th stuff. \"very fine people hoax\" The non stop russia stuff. Censorship from social media and the gov't on republicans especially during covid (literally banned the president from twitter). Twitter files.....Mark zuckerburg backing up those claims up. Hunter biden laptop not that I cared about the laptop or hunter per say but the fact that it was heavily censored and banned and we were told it was all russian disinfo only to be found out it was true.\n\nThe 2x assassination attempts probably alone would make me vote for trump because I can't align with a party that thinks that is ok.\n\nTheres a lot there but the generally jist of it is I can't align with fake news hysteria. Thats not the democratic party I voted for under obama. If democrats ever got back to being more pragmatic and logical I very well may vote for them again but something tells me thats not gonna be for a while......",

Historically, the US has had very positive relationships with most of the world. By contrast, our relationship with Russia and China has been adversarial for the entire lifetime of the majority of our population. \n\n> as far as money goes you mean like this? https://2009-2017.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rpt/eurasiafy10/156881.htm\n\nI did not say money or allude to it in any way. No idea what you\u2019re referencing. \n\n> Especially when we just found out USAID was funneling money to media orgs in ukraine.\n\nEspecially what? This does not answer any of my questions, it is just a vague follow up to a comment you made that was unrelated to anything I said\n\n> I remember when dems tried to impeach trump because russia spent 100k on facebook ads. Yet we have funneled millions into ukraine for decades to start a coup in 2014. Now you are all shocked pikachu face like you dunno how that happen. SMH.\n\nDems actually *did* impeach Trump\u2026twice, successfully. And 100k in Facebook ads was not a central part of the reasoning either time. It is no secret that the USA gives lots of money to many countries around the world including Ukraine. What evidence do you have that there was a coup in 2014?\n\n> Ukraine has been losing the whole time only people drunk on propaganda think otherwise. Russia is dealing with them with kid gloves on. Where do you logically see it going if ukraine doesn\u2019t make a deal?\n\nUkraine is a small fraction of the size of Russia, and they voluntarily surrendered their nukes to us in exchange for guaranteed protection against an inevitable invasion by Russia. That treaty was a large victory for the US, at the time. What kind of deal should Ukraine make now that is in their best interest?\n\n> Like whats the point? Peace can be made tomorrow and 10s of thousands if not 100s of thousands of lives could be saved.....Or it can end in 5 years as russia slowly grinds down ukraine at its leisure through a war of attrition.\n\nCapitulating to tyrants and invaders is the worst international policy you could possibly have. The point is that they literally don\u2019t have a country if Russia can waltz in and take whatever they want without repercussions at any time. \n\n> But I imagine you are the same people who think russia is running out of missiles soon and stuff like that.\n\nInteresting, but incorrect. Would you mind answering some of my questions directly now please?",

Trump won me over during his first term and I fully supported him in the 2020 and 2024 elections. \n\nI became a Trump supporter because of several factors. The first thing that brought me over was how comfortable and supportive Democrats had become with political violence against their opposition. During that time all over social media every liberal I knew was talking about punching Nazis, and loved sharing that stupid comic about the paradox of intolerance as well as videos of Antifa and liberals attacking Trump supporters. Almost nothing they supported was actual Nazis getting attacked, but rather simply their political opposition. They then tried to gaslight us by claiming Antifa doesn't even exist. I'm not sure Democrats realize how much their own bad behavior led to the creation of many Trump supporters.\n\nThe next thing that won me over was Trump's policies. I had become disillusioned with the Republican party prior to Trump. The big names in the party before Trump, the Bushes, Cheney's, McCain's, etc. seemed to be willing to fight tooth and nail to get us into any and every foreign conflict, but couldn't lift a finger to support an actual conservative agenda and certainly would never fight to put America first. Trump was the absolute opposite. \n\nI started supporting Trump in his first term and have only grown to support him more. Democrats have done nothing to convince me they should play a role in running our country, especially with the disaster of Biden's presidency, and Trump this term has taken the gloves off and is getting things done for this country.",

At best she's a loon as far as I'm concerned. \n\n>being co-defendants with Epstein for the rape of a 13 year old in \u201896, talking about his daughters breasts when she was 3, talking about dating a 10 year old in 10 years, and bragging about watching children change at his pageants?\n\nThe rest of this I would need context for. I understand you're using this to say he's a bad person (at least a rapist and very plausible a pedophile) and how could I vote for him if he's such a terrible person. I'm not going to play into that.",

I'm very aware Trump is also against them, which would be why I literally said both of those in my previous comment. I stand correct, again.\n\nAh, I misunderstood again, my bad. Let me try this again. \n\nTrump does align with everything I said he does. It's just not in the way leftists like you would prefer. For example, concerning abortion, Trump is in favor of exceptions for rape and incest. He's also fine with the abortion pill being distributed. He has been in countless fights with the pro-life community over these things, even though he's only slightly better than the left on this. The left is for unrestricted baby murder, Trump is less for that and got Roe taken away. He's the better option. \n\nYou brought up human rights for trans people. The right is largely for their human rights, we're just not going to agree on leftist logic. A transwoman is a type of man and a trans man is a type of woman. Transwomen are not women, transwomen are not men. Men are not allowed in women's spaces, so our sports and bathrooms are ours. Having them recognize their own biology and acting accordingly isn't taking away human rights. We're fine with them getting jobs, having housing, and getting food and everything else. \n\nThose are only two examples but this is my point. You're evaluating and phrasing things based on your own criteria and not seeing the reality. Trump's actual positions are just Democrat ones from the 90s, y'all would've been on the same side a couple decades ago. \n\n>None of that is good enough for you to even entertain the possibility of acknowledging that he's not a good person?\n\nI don't believe he did any of that. I haven't seen evidence of that, just heard it repeated over and over.",

Just crossing the border, no. Once they get here they're taking our money and resources and that harms Americans. \n\n>Do you agree that there are those migrants to whom legal avenues of immigration are not realistically attainable either because of the situation they find themselves in (destitution) or because they lack minimum qualifications? \n\nSure. \n\n>I am also curious about your take on those who cheat the system to ensure the legality of their status, such as green card marriages.

Something I love about Japan's is that it's really really dense to finally become a citizen. \n\n>Do you think legal avenues for immigration should be expanded as a measure do combat illegal immigration? \n\nNot really. I think we need to reform immigration period, but I have no interest in making it easier for immigrants. \n\n>Do you think the circumstances of migrant\u2019s living condition in their home countries should be given any consideration in their ability to immigrate to the US or do you think we should uphold a system based only on merit and qualifications, i.e. only allow the educated ones into the country?\n\nNo. I do not care how bad someone's life is in Central America, South America, Africa, wherever. Their suffering does not mean that we should open our arms wide and bring them in, especially when our country is falling apart. \n\nWhen our country is not in shambles, then we should consider who can come in based on our benefit.\n\n>It sure does not sound like you have much empathy for illegal immigrants and the plight that motivates them to leave the country, but I will take your word for it that you at least feel empathy. \n\nLike I said before, my empathy does not control me.

I was here through COVID, which was handled exactly as Fauci (and the World Health Organisation) recommended. Most Aussies didn't kick up a fuss, as much as it sucked, because we got it.\n\nI live in Adelaide, which for the first *two years or so* of the pandemic had [six deaths from COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_Australia). *Six.* It was only after we loosened restrictions that the death rate went up significantly. (That number of six includes two deaths in the last 4 days of December 2021, after the restrictions had already been loosened. One of those deaths was a two year old.)\n\nWhen my husband and I caught COVID the first time, we had already been vaccinated, and he still wound up in the hospital. The doctors told him the vaccination probably saved his life, because although he had no risk factors for death except being over 40, COVID hit him really hard. (It hit me hard too, I can't remember being much sicker.)\n\nThankfully he survived it and his grandparents, both in their 80s, also survived it- they will have been married 70 years this year, and they are a joy and source of so much love to us all.\n\nAs of [the 19th of February 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_death_rates_by_country), the US has had 1.2 million deaths in a population of 340 million, with a death rate of 3,560 deaths per million people. Of all the wealthy countries, it has the highest death rate by far.\n\nAustralia has had 25,000 deaths in a population of 27 million and has a death rate of 963 deaths per million people.\n\nI still have family back in the States, but thankfully few elderly relatives, and of those that are they are all former doctors or other health care professionals. My mother, who's 80 now, moved back in with her spouse from the nursing home because she was too at risk for COVID there and she and her spouse self-segregated and disinfected everything that came into the house. But she's still here! She only got COVID after, I want to say, three or four vaccines. \n\nSo you can see why I'm curious about why you didn't like how the Democrats handled COVID. From over here, they were the ones who seemed to be advocating for common sense.",

Even though we know how both email leaks happened (One, the files were locally copied onto a USB 2.0 flash drive, based on the file creation dates, implying the hack was local. The other was Podesta falling for a phishing scam and had a laughably weak password.) I remember shortly after the election, the Russia Collision hoax, even though no one could ever tell me what crime/ impropriety Trump did. It baffles me how many people believed such a nebulous claim.\n\nEdit: Oh, and the fake piss document. Trump had an alibi.",

I watched the debates in 2016, I observed him as President, I watched his COVID Press conferences, I heard him say before the election in 2020 that if he loses the election it means it was rigged, I heard his election fraud claims, I saw his speech on Jan 6, and I have seen his Truth Social rants.
