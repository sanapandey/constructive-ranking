    "selftext": "Conversations at large have left me feeling like we don't agree on the \"American Identity\" anymore. Maybe we never did. \n\nGrowing up as a child in this country I always believed we were wholesome, honest, and good human beings. As adulthood sets in one is inevitably confronted with the complex realities of life. Nothing is ever just one or the other. I acknowledge that we live in a world of difficult decisions, and impossible ultimatums.\n\nA lot of people are upset. All the time.\n\nI just got done reading through another thread on this subreddit where some of us unashamedly don't care what happens to anyone else, as long as it's good for us. America first.\n\nHow did we get here? When all human beings look to the United States of America, what will they see? What do we represent? Is it something we can be proud of? Does it even matter?\n\nI thought it did. It does to me.\n\nThis is not an attack on Trump Supporters. However, this subreddit is about asking you specifically, so I'll leave it to you to answer.\n\nWho are we?",

There were far fewer radio stations. There were only a handful of magazines and periodicals.\u00a0\n\n\nWe somehow still managed to cater to most interests, with a much lower number of outlets.\u00a0\n\n\nI almost hate to say this, but it seems that our collective culture seems to stem from our mass media, because contrast that media landscape with today's media landscape.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are more channels than you can count. There is so much content on so many streaming platforms from so many different countries, there are probably two people who are capable of voting who have literally never seen the same show or movie as one another.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm guilty of this as well, I canceled cable over a decade ago and exclusively watch content on YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime. I don't have Hulu or Paramount or peacock or anything like that. Perhaps my views would be slightly different if I had those instead?\u00a0\n\n\nWe are all shaped by our environment, and today our environment can change so much from one person to the next.\n\n\nThe same goes for city/rural living, religious/atheistic upbringing, and many other spectrums.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not saying that the way things were is necessarily desirable, but the unified culture they produced certainly seems to be.\u00a0\n\n\nI suppose we should examine whether or not we can have a shared culture without regressing on our freedoms or our ability to choose things for ourselves rather than have them be force-fed.",

Heck, Obama fired military lawyers and leading officials with the stated goal of ensuring that everyone followed his policy and vision.  Biden did similar, firing Trump era staff and replacing them.\n\nYour statement is one born on assumptions promoted by politicians and their allies who have a vested interest in Trump losing, who weaponize every mechanism available to them against political opposition, who have made efforts to literally stifle the freedom of expression and even attempted to make a \"board of Misinformation\" to punish any speech \\*THEY\\* decided was \"not true\", and whose exact stance on the power of the President at any given time changes depending on how politically convenient it is at any given time.\n\nThe kind of people who will point and scream at Trump for doing something, even if it's something Biden or Obama or Clinton did, and then defend their position by saying 'that's in the past' which is just another way of admitting they have no intention of ever being consistent because what is or is not \"okay\" changes based on convenience rather than any moral value.",

On the \"right to life\", the US policies on gun control, tolerance for \"stand your ground\" violence, homicide rates, etc., whether right or wrong, from a \"right to life\" perspective they make things worse than the other advanced western countries.  \nOn liberty, again, in the US there are limitations on many things absent here (some silly ones come to mind), but the very concept of prison here is not to punish but to rehabilitate, while in the US prisons are to remove (and punish) criminals from society. What liberty has the US that some other countries dont? On prosperity maybe, but that is also a bit blurry as the cultural elements need to be considered more.\n\nIndeed from here, the American freedoms seem superior to any other country only for \"economic freedom\", or better, \"freedom to make money\" (e.g. denmark scores better than US on business freedom, but certainly you can't make the same money with the income taxes they have).

You can find everything from scientific journals to science communication channels (think hank green, star talk and a million more) and all of it needs verified by searching to find if there is consensus by experts in the subject.

In worst faith, \"America First\" means grabbing as much bread as you can and letting non-Americans starve. In best faith, we make our own bread and showcase how it's done so everyone can have bread so long as they're willing to work. While we do have finite resources, the situation isn't so dire that we can't all prosper. \n\nI know many Trump supporters are either imprecise with their words or righteously angry from personal experience. I've heard from several who served in Iraq and Afghanistan that the local attitude was \"just wait for the Americans to solve it.\" I'm sure that's not every non-American, as we do have some excellent allies, but we do need to draw the distinction between those worthy of our effort and those who are freeloading. \n\nSince before 1776, we have been a nation of migrants, seeking opportunity in hard work.

Here's a key difference: what I view as the worst things in our history resulted from lies, general dishonesty, judicial impositions, etc. \n\nThat is absolutely *not* the case with the left. Their critiques inevitably lead to the conclusion that Americans on average were, to varying degrees, immoral (ranging from inconsiderate and hypocritical, to outright evil and vicious). For example, if you think women voting is super important and morally self-evident, then you must implicitly condemn Americans for its absence, our Founders for it apparently slipping their minds, etc.\n\nYou're talking about our history as if people have a detached, analytical view in the same way that they apply when talking about Prohibition (where people, at worst, sort of mock the anti-alcohol sentiment, but they don't treat us as evil).

Now I think I see the divergence between your perspective and the typical liberal perspective: liberals believe that if one group has access to significantly better opportunities than another group, that is wrong, and it is the responsibility of the government to correct it. Thus, a society that has significant inequalities is \"bad\", and a government that does address those inequalities is incompetent, ignorant, and/or malicious. I think you would say that it is not the responsibility of a government to ensure equality, it is simply to ensure that no citizens can impose themselves on other citizens, and inequality that arises from _the absence of_ consensual access is outside its purview. So if Group A and Group B have different qualities of life, that's not the responsibility of the government, unless Group A was actively stealing property or actively interfering in the lives of Group B.

Thanks for explaining! I may disagree, but do see the logic you followed to arrive at this conclusion. For what it's worth, most liberals I know would also say, \"I am American, I am proud of our history (overall), and I have no other country I can (or would) leave us for.\" The 'overall' is an important quantifier. There probably are people on the far left who believe the US is completely indefensible before 1960. However, I think it is a small minority, in the same way that people on the far right are a small minority. The only way to have such un-nuanced, reductive beliefs is to abandon all logic, and I'm optimistic that the vast majority of people go about their lives trying to make logical decisions.

I go back that far because if you dig down to the root of most political debates today, that is where you end up.\n\nThis is easily testable of course.

You may disagree that this is the cause of our decline, but there\u2019s no denying the statistical realities of the explosion of wealth inequality.

The argument was that certainty, whole society moral lines, strong identity, enforced order, etc. were too dangerous (it could lead to Nazis!) so everyone must be atomized, norms must be destroyed, and only extreme disunity of everyone doing whatever *they* wanted, could keep societies from going full Nazi.   \n  \nWhat ensued was a series of Cultural Revolutions, dissolutions and inversions that really took off in the 1960s onward. We have in effect been operating under two different Constitutions ever since. The Obama-Bush-DEI-Globalism era was the apex of the new Constitution, and the Vance-Trump concept is a very mild resurgence of the traditional, unique, \"Certain Society\" that had been forced down for over half a century.\n\nFor more on these ideas, see books like R.R. Reno's [*Return of the Strong Gods*](https://www.regnery.com/9781684512690/return-of-the-strong-gods/)*,* and Christopher Caldwell's [*Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Entitlement:_America_Since_the_Sixties).",

If we look at facts; Jim Crow laws stipulated that African Americans needed to pay a poll tax and take unfair literacy tests in order to vote, had to attend separate and more poorly funded schools, could only sit in designated areas in buses, railroads, essentially any public setting, and the list goes on. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just an idiot, but is DEI disenfranchising white, Christian, males in this way?  \n\nFrom my understanding DEI simply supports organizational frameworks that seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of ALL people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination based on identity or disability.  \n\nI think it\u2019s important to take note of the word \u201call\u201d here. I understand you may take offense with its focus on historically underrepresented groups. As a white male I can\u2019t say that I personally have ever noticed unfair treatment as a result of DEI. But that\u2019s just my anecdotal experience. \n\nI mean, I guess it might be more competitive to get a job now. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing, I also believe more diversity in the work force is a good thing (more diverse perspectives and ideas).

I think DEI just makes sure you don't skip qualified minorities and hire all white companies. It is literally just a mandate by the companies that states you have to hire the most qualified candidate, and you can't skip the most qualified candidate because they are black or a woman. This was a major issue before we had DEI. There is nothing in the framework of DEI that allows for someone to be discriminated against because they aren't a minority. \n\nI have worked at companies that had DEI programs and it was implemented there by literally redacting information like name and address ect that could insinuate what race gender or economic class hiring candidates are from so that race and gender are not known by the person hiring. Literally impossible for it to hire unqualified candidates because they are black and impossible to skip white candidates because they are white. All the information they have is what qualifications do you have.\n\nAs far as the \"patronage system\" you described, where do you get that idea? I live in the south and like 90% of business owners here are hyper republican. DEI is a program implemented voluntarily by the positions of power you described, so do you think these people were trying to replace themselves with democrats? They failed if that was their goal. \n\nWhy is it so hard to believe that liberal values have just simply gained popularity over the years?

Childcare costs are almost prohibitive for many families. \n\nDon't get me started on H-1B recipients. I work with thousands of them and the \"best and brightest\" label is pure fantasy. Furthermore, bringing in these people puts downward pressure on wages, discouraging Americans from pursuing training for these positions. If there were no H-1Bs or mass immigration, American companies would simply have to pay more for talent, which would in turn attract more talent to those fields. Highly skilled professional IT workers, for example, are severely underpaid and wages have not even remotely kept up with inflation and the average wage increases across the economy.",

In other words, immigration is needed to maintain a growing population.\n\n  \nAnd if the population stops growing it would necessitate a shift away from a growth economy, i.e. the foundation of national success over the past 200 years. Productivity gains can only go so far and will eventually put downward pressure on wages itself as automation spreads across the economy. \n\nWhy do you think wages have been stagnant over the past few decades, while corporate profits and executive compensation have continued to balloon and while the average worker has grown 5x more productive? I'm not especially liberal, but to me it's pretty obvious that the money generated by productivity gains is going to shareholders and executives rather than to workers.

Suffice to say, endless growth is an unsustainable model and I don't believe it should be the north star of domestic economic policy. \n\nI think downward pressure on wages leading to higher profit margins is a huge reason for these ballooning salaries.

Advancements in modern medicine have only exacerbated this pattern. This happens with or without immigrants. \n\nAmericans were sold the idea of upskilling for decades, with college and white collar jobs becoming viewed as the primary path to success for the middle-class. This raises the floor, requiring parents to invest even more money in their children, which, if the parents want to be equitable, makes it harder to raise more than 2-3 from a financial perspective. \n\nSince more Americans than ever are competing for these upskilled jobs, fewer than ever are willing to go into trades or \"lower-class\" jobs that were not the focus of the \"college for all\" ethos. Immigrants have picked up the slack here, as they are, again, doing jobs most Americans don't want. That doesn't put downward pressure on wages for the jobs most Americans are seeking; rather the effect is negligible, and American needs immigrants to fill these sorts of roles.\n\nAnd I'm not advocating for a growth economy at all costs, but what would the alternative be? Growth built America. Stagnation didn't go very well for the Soviet Union. The economy should certainly be retooled to be more sustainable (from an environmental perspective especially), but at its core growth means people are engaging in economic activity. The more people engaging in economic activity, the more value is being created, and the more synergies society can unlock. This enables development and innovation which I would argue are very beneficial things to prioritize.",
