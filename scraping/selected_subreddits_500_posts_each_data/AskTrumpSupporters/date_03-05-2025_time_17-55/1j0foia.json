Any treaty made with Russia is as good as the paper it was written on, and about as bulletproof.  Russia will, at least under its current leadership, always attempt to advance Russian interests.  There is no trustworthiness there--keep in mind, I'm not talking about the Russian people here, but the country and its leaders.\n\nBut, on the same token, Ukraine has fought well, but they are inevitably losing this war.  It's been far past time to figure out how to lose less than continuing to bleed for national pride.  It sucks.  It really freaking sucks.  But it will take more than money and materiel to stop Russia from throwing more bodies into the gristmill to get what it wants.\n\nThat puts Ukraine in a very untenable situation.  I don't know how to resolve it.  If they make concessions and get a peace treaty, there is virtually nothing stopping Russia from just taking off another bite after spending time repairing.  But what do you do?  Do you vow to fight until the last Ukrainian has spent their blood and the country is no more?\n\nIf I were in the position of Ukraine, heck yes, I would.  I don't care that I'm old, I use a cane quite a bit of the time, or that my vision ain't what it used to be (I need to get new contacts).  I would be out there defending my country against an aggressive military invasion to the best of my ability, and to heck with the consequences.  And I would be calling for all my \"allies\" to support me as much as possible.  So I completely understand his stance here.\n\nI don't know what a decent resolution will be.

Russia has been the aggressor in this conflict for a decade, and they have violated multiple ceasefire agreements. If Zelensky declines the deal on the grounds that it wouldn't actually lead to peace and justice for his people, do you still believe he is responsible?

If the US gives a $175k Javelin missile to Ukraine and they used it to destroy a $40 million T-80M and it saves the lives of 10 Ukrainian fighters does that mean the US only provided $175k worth of aid?\n\nI think the relevant fact is that the US alone has put in something like 40% of the aid to Ukraine.\n\n> If Zelensky declines the deal on the grounds that it wouldn't actually lead to peace and justice for his people, do you still believe he is responsible?\n\nI think it is unwise to argue this out in the Oval Office on camera. Ukraine absolutely has a position in this discussion worthy of representation but Zolenskyy went about it all wrong. JD Vance made the point that 2 presidents who condemned Russia and didn't use diplomacy didn't make the situation better so the time had come to try diplomacy. Zolenskyy is right to question if Russia can be trusted to abide by any diplomatic terms given their history but this was not the venue to hash that out and Zolenskyy did it terribly.",

Trump has made it clear he wants the dying to stop. He just doesn't end it at stopping Ukrainians from dying but includes Russians too. Trying to beg sympathy with a \"look how the Russians are treating us\" is a bad route to take because Trump is very clear on his stance. If anything that gives Trump the ability to say \"That's horrible and that's why we need to make a deal\". Zolenskyy tends to try and trade too much on Ukraine's suffering. Globally that isn't a very popular tact given how often major powers ignore suffering.\n\n>  was in reference to his troops fighting Russian troops alone\n\nI guarantee it was, but it's still a foolish and disrespectful thing to say. Ukraine has been the recipient of the largest multinational military support effort since WWII. Those soldiers have been trained by US, British, French, German, Canadian troops and others. They have equipment from all over the world. Saying they've been doing it alone for 3 years is the absolute wrong thing to say, especially when you're trying to get even more help.",

                            "body": "Because it is self evidently clear.\n\nAt the start of the war Ukraine was being given support systems like medical equipment, body armor, helmets and Ammunition. That grew to ATGMs and MANPADS and then to artillery systems and APCs and IFVs. It went from cold war era stockpile to HIMARS with ATACMs, Patriot batteries, and ground radars. There are British Challenger 2 tanks and German Leopard 2s operating on Russian soil and US made Switchblade drones are being used to hunt down Russian armor. I forget if it was Latvia or Lithuania but one of them donated *all* of their artillery to Ukraine. \n\nJoe Biden told the American people American tanks and jets would not be sent to Ukraine, and that American long range weapons would not be used to attack Russian soil, that the US would only equip Ukraine with the tools to defend itself. Now? American tanks are operating with the Ukrainian army, HIMARS have had ATACMs for months, F16s are flying over Ukraine and in the waning days of his presidency the Biden administration authorized long range American weapons to attack Russian soil.\n\nMeanwhile Ukraine has been utilizing Storm Shadow missiles on Russian soil and has units that didn't exist even in 2022 that are operating with French Caesar self propelled artillery and AMX armored cars, German Leopard 1 and 2 tanks, American Bradley IFV and Stryker ICV, and equipped with American rifles and machine guns and trained by the French and British military.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva was done with American intelligence to locate and identify the ship. American intelligence was essential to warning Ukraine of Russia's invasion and what were the likely targets of its opening missile attacks, saving several jets and ADS that prevented Russia from gaining air superiority over Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian special forces and intelligence operatives sabotaged the Nord stream pipeline to erode European economic ties to Russia that made them hesitant to more fully support Ukraine. Ukraine has also aided African rebels (or terrorists depending how you want to look at it) against the government of Mali to strike at Wagner forces. Ukraine also aided Syrian rebels in toppling Asad.\n\nRussia has engaged in clandestine acts of sabotage in Europe targeting warehouses and factories to reduce aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe massive aid flowing to Ukraine has forced Russia to seek allies in traditional western enemies like Iran, North Korea and China. In exchange for captured western supplies Iran is supplying Russia with drones, China is providing everything from rations to individual load bearing equipment to armored vehicles, and both nations are helping Russia circumvent sanctions to be able to produce precision weapons. North Korea was supplying artillery and Ammunition and now is just straight up supplying combat troops in exchange for more modern jets for its air force.\n\nUkrainian vehicles supplied by NATO are being repaired in NATO countries that Russia can't attack. Romania and Poland are authorizing their armed forces to shoot down Russian missiles and drones that cross their territory. The idea has been floated by France for French or multinational troops to relieve Ukrainian troops in the rear areas, such as the border with Belarus, to free them up for the frontlines.\n\nFrankly if Russia were to openly attack the nations providing substantial military support to Ukraine it'd be completely understandable given that Ukraine is now entirely dependent on foreign aid from NATO to keep fighting. The EU has also funded the Ukrainian budget to make up for shortfalls in soldiers' pay, so at least a portion of Ukraine's army is trained, equipped and funded by the west.\n\nRussia for their part has been clear that this is a provocation. They've said several times \"if you do this you will be involving yourself in the war\". Russia is telling its own people that they are at war with NATO. As this war goes on it's becoming ever more likely that Russia will feel that it has no strategic choice but to target the mechanisms NATO is using to directly support Ukraine.\n\nAnd the western reaction has been to scoff at Russia's threats and keep pushing the line. The conventional understanding has been that the west is \"boiling the frog\" by gradually increasing the level of support to Ukraine in such a way that Russia doesn't respond and Ukraine gets stronger. However it's also possible to boil yourself: keep increasing support to Ukraine gradually until you're providing massive amounts of direct military support and Russia feels that they *must* strike our allies to turn the tide of the war. If whole Ukrainian brigades are trained, armed, equipped and funded by the west how could Russia not consider direct attacks?\n\nFrankly when you look at the timeline and events of the war I'm not sure how you come to any conclusion besides that it's edging dangerously close to becoming another world war if it hasn't already reached that level.",

If Russia felt it couldn't overcome Ukraine without targeting its foreign support, why wouldn't they?\n\nOr, perhaps more likely, why wouldn't they support or enable Iran, China or North Korea to oppose western interests?\n\nThe idea that just because we are strong enough to beat someone up there won't be damage is foolish.

Zelensky is unreasonable to expect the US to agree to economic agreements and security guarantees during an active war with a nuclear power, especially when zelensky has plainly said he wants all of his conquered territory back and for Russia to pay for the war.

The war is still popular there and the country is behind Zelensky. If we agree on this, we can move on to whether or not funding Ukraine\u2019s defense is in our interests, but your comment didn\u2019t really touch on that so I\u2019ll wait.\n\n2) I agree that Ukraine is losing and unfortunately it seems likely that they will have to cede territory to Russia. So how do we secure longterm peace given that Russia will want to start shit again as soon as they can? It is pretty simple imo. We let Ukraine into NATO. We make their NATO membership a condition of any peace treaty. This war and the sanctions are hurting Russia very much too. Taking land lets Putin claim victory, the NATO membership secures Ukraine\u2019s longterm survival, and Trump gets to claim he\u2019s a foreign policy genius. Everybody \u201cwins\u201d (as much as is possible in a war like this).\n\nWhat do you think about this solution? and why is Trump against letting Ukraine into nato?",

I\u2019d say just Keep doing that?  I mean we\u2019re going to spend that money anyways - let\u2019s be honest the last thing DOGE is coming for is defense spending. We might as well put it toward something useful which is weakening Russia. Russia won\u2019t back away on their own because they know they would look inferior (which they are but they don\u2019t want to look that way). But they can\u2019t spend with the US and Europe - not even close. But they will bleed themselves dry trying. And that is as a good of a victory as we could ever hope for. \n\nIf it helps don\u2019t think of this money as helping Ukraine fight a war think of it as every dollar we spend Russia has to match and they don\u2019t have that ability. We\u2019re weakening one of our greatest enemies on the world stage and we don\u2019t have shed a single drop of blood to do so.\n\nI honestly think Ukraine \u201cwinning\u201d is not the United States best scenario. It\u2019s that Russia has to keep spending money they don\u2019t have to fight a war that continues going on. Then one day Russia dissolves and we make these smaller broken up countries give up nuclear weapons in exchange for US security in their country. That would be the biggest military win of our lifetime in my opinion",

For the entire concept and idea of economic and global interdependence to avoid global conflict through economic reliance upon one another, what are your thoughts on the lack of actual political punishment held against Russia? The failure to economically isolate Russia from its global trade partners seems to be a catastrophic mistake in my view, as the incentive to pursue imperialist expansionist policies are being validated",

From my perspective it seems Trump is burning all our bridges with historic trade partners in order to defend a historic enemy with a lagging economy. Reducing our presence and viability as a trade partner on the global market seems counterproductive to putting America first. \n\nFor instance, Canada makes a lot of fertilizer that traditionally has been exported to the US. However, after Trump's threats of tariffs, and now his behavior toward Zelensky, Canada now seems more interested in strengthening trade relations with their allies rather than maintaining relations with the US. Without this fertilizer, America's ability to grow crops (and therefore feed livestock, as well as its people) will be significantly diminished, and will likely lead to numerous deaths and civil unrest. How does Trump's behavior align with \"America First,\" if at all, in this regard?",

So I think Zelensky\u2019s position is he needs the US (and Europe) to say if Russia breaks this peace deal they\u2019re going to come to Ukraines aid again. The only thing that is going to stop Putin from reinvading Ukraine again in a few years when the Russian army rebuilds is the threat of the west - it\u2019s not going to be Ukraine. \n\nHis stance to me is pretty logical. Right now Russia\u2019s army is as weak as it\u2019s ever been. His best chance if he has to go it alone is right now. So without Trump saying the US has your back if Putin does it again he really has no choice but to continue fighting. Right?",

I thought that's why people complained when Russia took Crimea in 2014 and had no real consequences. Not to mention all the aid to Ukraine will quite literally have been a waste if Russia ends up getting everything it wants. I just don't see any angle where this \"give us money or we'll let Putin destroy you\" helps the US out at all. Is Russia gonna give us those mineral deposits for free if they control them?",

Those who defend this position will often argue that people should have to pay for the health care they use. I shouldn't have to pay someone else's.\n\n\nMost people in the developed world have access to universal health care and there's a good reason for this:\n\n\nillnesses are by and large a product of genetics, meaning we do not have much choice when it comes to the illnesses we may suffer from during the course of our lives. Why then, are we treating this like a free market economy when it lacks some of the fundamental requirements of such a system (specifically having the choice to invest in or contribute to ventures that we expect to succeed financially).\n\n\nGiven that anyone can go through life either with very few health issues, or an inordinate amount of them, why wouldn't we want to pay for a system that can sustain anyone when they need the help. If I go through life having paid a substantial sum in taxes towards health care services while only ever needing to use a small fraction of my share of payments, should I be bitter about this or grateful that my luck was good? Sometimes it's beneficial to the whole to eliminate the specter of crushing financial requirements should something unforeseen occur.\u00a0\n\n\nI see an analogy to your view that the the Ukraine owes money for the services the US provided to mitigate against a dictator's d\u00e9stabilising actions. We should be grateful it isn't us having to live through the war and maybe see this as part of the price of maintaining stability in the world (a mutually beneficial outcome).\n\n\nUkraine didn't pick their illness. They are still in the thick of it. Why are we harassing them about the exorbitant hospital bills?",

However, I\u2019m willing to bet that a vast majority of people think that their tax dollars should go to Americans first. Based on this logic, it only makes sense for any foreign aid to be structured in a way to be paid back in the future.

As you Taiwan is a big concern for US, and with industrial capacity is already limited and will not match at this current rate of on going conflict. Let\u2019s go back to Ukraine, I say that because the country is a match for Russia. Zelenskyy should look at Israel defensive model, it might not have a mutual defense with the US or Europe but Israel has strategic partnership the US which gives them diplomatic and military flexibility. Trump\u2019s team is giving a strategic partnership regarding mineral development opening up- ambiguity, Zelenskyy should negotiate giving them access to high tech weapons.

In fact, the post-war era is what cemented the US as the dominant global power- before WWII it was Britain and France. The US took European assets, absorbed top scientific and engineering talent (Operation Paperclip, among others), and built a global financial system centred on the dollar. Europe followed US leadership even when it hurt them\u2014 joining costly wars, aligning with US economic policies, and relying on American security guarantees. If Europe aligned itself with Russia or china during this period, the US wouldn\u2019t be the country it is today. The Marshall Plan, NATO, and the Bretton Woods system all strengthened US influence, not weakened it. The last 80 years have been a golden era for American power, not a decline.

By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances, and in December 1994, Ukraine became a non-nuclear weapon state-party to the 1968 nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The last strategic nuclear delivery vehicle in Ukraine was eliminated in 2001 under the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). It took years of political maneuvering and diplomatic work, starting with the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, to remove the weapons and nuclear infrastructure from Ukraine.\n\nAND\n\nThe Massandra Accords set the stage for the ultimately successful trilateral talks. As the United States mediated between Russia and Ukraine, the three countries signed the Trilateral Statement on January 14, 1994. Ukraine committed to full disarmament, including strategic weapons, in exchange for economic support and security assurances from the United States and Russia. Ukraine agreed to transfer its nuclear warheads to Russia and accepted U.S. assistance in dismantling missiles, bombers, and nuclear infrastructure. Ukraine\u2019s warheads would be dismantled in Russia, and Ukraine would receive compensation for the commercial value of the highly enriched uranium. Ukraine ratified START on February 3, 1994, repealing its earlier preconditions, but it would not accede to the NPT without further security assurances.\n\nhttps://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/ukraine-nuclear-weapons-and-security-assurances-glance\n\nThe US agreed not to attack Ukraine and to help dismantle nukes.

Trump is asked why he's being so diplomatic with Putin and he explains exactly what I've been pointing out:\n\n>\"If I hadn\u2019t aligned myself with both of them, you\u2019d never have a deal. You want me to say terrible things about Putin and then turn around and say, \u2018*Hi, Vladimir, how\u2019s the deal going?*\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work that way.\"\n\nTrump is volunteering to do this mediation. He could do something else and let them duke it out. Yet Zelensky comes in and nukes the approach of the only recent president under which Putin didn't fuck Ukraine. It's small and stupid and he shut himself out of the negotiation. \n\nAt the core of this is the security guarantees. This is diplomatic speak for the US committing to WWIII at Putin's trigger. We don't do that for Taiwan so it's not going to happen for Ukraine. It's insane to ask on live TV. \n\nIf NS want to send your children to die for Ukraine for some cathartic release & virtue signaling go ahead. They are taking volunteers.\n\nTo anyone else Trump's approach is sensible. The slaughter stops, both sides have an offramp without losing too much face domestically, and the minerals deal puts a defacto American interest in Ukraine without straight up playing Russian roulette with the human race.",

Because conducting elections during an invasion is impractical due to severe security risks, widespread displacement of citizens, compromised territorial integrity, and legal prohibitions under martial law. Does that make sense?\n\nAlso, it isn\u2019t like not holding elections while at war is something novel. The UK postponed the 1940 election until after the war ended in 1945.

I find these sentiments surprising and unrealistic, but like JD I have never been to the Ukrainian front line, so my opinion is discounted.\n\nEurope and Zelensky both seem to be implying this is a war they can win with extremely favorable terms. So we should get out of their way and let them win it.\n\nLet it be on their head. They do not need us. I also think that democrats should feel free to enlist to fight in the war through the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. I hear only good things from those who have volunteered.",

What everyone saw and is commenting on is the last 5min of the conversation.\n\nTo summarize exactly what happened; Trump is being a negotiator between Ukraine and Russia. He\u2019s trying to get along with both sides. He was very nice and respectful to Zelenskyy for 45 minutes. A reporter literally asked him to bad mouth Russia and his reply was along the lines of \u201cwhy the hell would I do that. I\u2019m trying to negotiate peace!\u201d\n\nThroughout the conference, Zelenskyy repeatedly interrupted to bad mouth Putin. He has every right to hate Putin and Russia. That much is true. His problem is it clouds his judgement when it comes to sue for peace. He wants Russia punished to the max. He wants his lands back. He wants a strong US military in Ukraine. Specifically our air support. He can\u2019t have all those things. It\u2019s as simple as that. In negotiations, both sides have to compromise which means neither side gets exactly what they want.\n\nThe deal is, Russia keeps most the land they occupied and the USA gets access to Ukraines mineral mines in exchange for our previous help and continued support. The deal would have created peace and taken care of 95% of ending the war. The other 5% of the kinks could be figured out while people weren\u2019t dying. Trump had it all worked out and Zelenskyy ruined it.\n\nZelenskyy simply doesn\u2019t believe Putin will comply with the treaty. Like I said, his hate and Putins previous actions lead him to believe that. I happen to believe Trump negotiated on good terms with Putin and the peace treaty would have held. The rest of Europe has offered military protection to Ukraine and USA would never let Putin invade their mineral mines without serious repercussions.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole truth of the conference today and Zelenskyy\u2019s refusal to compromise will lead to a much worse deal for Ukraine if they even manage to not get fully conquered by Russia. I know some of you think Russia is weak but they are, in fact, stronger than Ukraine. Trump will not continue the war and start WWIII. Zelenskyy screwed himself and the Ukrainian people.",

Ukraine on the other hand doesn\u2019t get the land back AND has to pay the US. Not much of a deal for Ukraine is it?",

Like Trump said, they don\u2019t have cards to play. Gambling on WWIII is not something Trump will allow. So Ukraines options are let Russia completely occupy them and no longer remain a nation or give Russia the land occupied and USA access to mineral mines as a repayment for getting to keep most of their country.\n\nThat\u2019s what negotiations are.

That would just be reality, and any ceasefire/peace talks would have that as a baseline part of the agreement (Texas lost). \n\nI think this is one of the huge differences in perspective between liberals and conservatives on this conflict that is basically impossible to reconcile without one side totally conceding their viewpoint - conservatives seem to view the situation as Ukraine has outright lost the war, that the territory they lost is lost forever, and any peace agreement starts with that acknowledgement being the baseline of the peace.  Ukraine wants a \u201cpeace\u201d where they get everything back from Russia, functionally as if nothing ever happened.  Russia has literally no incentive to ever agree to any deal where they concede the land they\u2019ve taken.  That was the whole point of their attack.  Additionally, the US and Europe appear to be 100% set on not sending any actual soldiers to help Ukraine.\n\nWith all of that in play, in what universe is it even remotely possible or reasonable to entertain Ukraine\u2019s \u201cdemands\u201d that all territory be given back to them when Russia will never ever do that?  The options become just continue the war indefinitely, concede the land and find peace some other way, or somehow convince the US and/or Europe to actually commit to a true war against Russia where our troops are actively involved in the fighting.  Trump\u2019s proposed deal may have been harsh and heavily skewed towards the US.  But if Zelensky actually wants peace in Ukraine, he\u2019s in no position at all to make ANY demands of the US, Europe, or Russia.  I don\u2019t see any outcome here where Ukraine \u201cwins\u201d (at least in a way they would define it), so it comes down to how badly do they want to lose, and taking the best available option to save the lives of their remaining citizens.",

I'm not a fan of Putin or Russia but I do have a decent background on this topic so I'd encourage you to approach the wall of text with an open mind. \n\nI had a post earlier touching on the durability of idealist vs realist approaches to international relations, and it also applies here. We in the west are advocates of state sovereignty and self determination. We think every country regardless of location is entitled to choose their friends, allies, and trade partners. This is an idealist position, and it is only as strong as you will enforce it.\n\nRussia has a realist approach, not only because they kind of have to--being at least historically opposed to the dominant international coalition (the West)--but also for philosophical reasons steeped in their culture. They believe in spheres of influence (not dissimilar to the Monroe Doctrine), buffer zones, and the retention of strategic assets. Spheres of influence are only as strong as they are enforced.\n\nThe mechanism I refer to is the gradual estrangement of Russia from the eurosphere and western pressure in the form of denying Russia strategic assets (Crimea) and buffers/spheres of influence (Western aligned Ukraine, NATO expansion, etc). These are all challenges from one great power to another. Russia has been fairly clear, from at least 2007, that this was not something they would tolerate. The west has continued on this path for now 15 years largely ignoring the position of the opposing great power, and in many ways intentionally misconstruing the Russian position to make antagonism more palatable. \n\nThe 2008 Abkhazia invasion was enforcement of the sphere of influence and denial of NATO expansion. The 2014 Crimea invasion was an enforcement of the sphere of influence and enforced retention of a key strategic asset (Sevastopol, the principal warm water port for the Russian navy). The 2022 invasion was a further enforcement of that sphere of influence, denial of NATO expansion, and a challenge to the eurosphere. \n\nSo, the basis of conflict is the collision between idealist absolute sovereignty and realist spheres of influence. It is resolved by who will enforce their position through military means. So far, the Russians have committed enormous resources to this enforcement, while the West is assisting in self defense of their target. The west isn't really \"imposing\" anything, and for understandable reasons. The last direct challenge to great power spheres of influence was the cuban missile crisis, which almost caused a nuclear war. These challenges are quite dangerous and do not happen often. As idealists turn to realists, enforcing the right of sovereignty of a low power against a great power, and likely starting a great power conflict, is not worth it.",

                            "body": "I think there may be a fundamental misunderstanding here about how this all works so let me lay a couple things out so I can adequately answer your question.\n\nWe have a unipolar system right now, the US is the only true super power. Russia, China, even the EU are strong regional powers. Neither have the capability to execute non-nuclear forced entry operations, and one of them, the EU, is composed of US vassal states. Those vassal states do not really have a \"pull\" ability to get military action out of the US when Article 5 is not in play. So...to be blunt, if the European allies aren't happy with our arrangements, what're they gonna do? \n\n>\"What good is America's word?\" \n\nAs good as it always has been, for the things we actually agreed to do. Find me a binding and senate ratified treaty that we have reneged on relevant to this discussion. Pointing to Budapest is putting levels of obligation in an intentionally vague document after the fact and being surprised when wishful thinking doesn't make it so. \n\n>Should the rest of the world get used to not having faith in the US, because you\u2019ll break a promise (or assurance, or treaty, or\u2026) to your allies the moment it no longer benefits you?\n\nSee above. The US is pretty deliberate and specific as to the type of binding agreements it gets into. \n\nSomething to understand is that idealism, particularly with international agreements, is very popular until the prospect of war (not conflict, not police actions, capital W War) rears it's head. Then the idealists start being realists. So you *can* gas up Georgia and later Ukraine about joining NATO, and you *can* pay little attention to the interests of the dominant regional power, but eventually push comes to shove and that's where actual treaties are tested. Not agreements, memoranda, assurances, pinkie swears, or whatever. Formal treaties. But...if you asked anyone in the previous administrations if we ever intended to send Americans to fight for Georgia or Ukraine or whoever, they would say absolutely not. \n\nRussia was quite insistent that NATO expansion was taken as an existential threat and has now invaded 2/2 times when it was seriously floated. I think there is a level of irresponsibility to continue mischaracterizing the strategic objectives of your adversary, don't you? There is a wide gap between believing a war is justified and understanding the factors leading up to it. \n\n\n>NATO no longer trusts that the US would honor article 5, even though we came to your aid every time you fought a war. \n\nI think that's NATO having a tough time reconciling their domestic demands with the looming need to actually spend on defense. I chalk it up to bitching and moaning. If Poland was actually invaded we would stomp some Russkies. \n\n>If the US lets its allies down, what\u2019s to stop Putin from using that power vacuum to grow stronger?\n\nHave to parse this one. Who's the ally in this situation? And which treaty are you referring to? What power vacuum? \n\nTwo things:\n\nThe capabilities of the Russian military are what's stopping Russia from exploiting any perceived physical openings. They still have trouble invading a country next door. Their capabilities for further forced entry into another theater are nonexistent. \n\nThe notion of this power vacuum vacated by the US (among vassal states) being filled by *Russia* is absurd. The unifying purpose among the continental allies is opposition to Russia. If anything the vacuum would be filled by France and Germany. And honestly it should be. The EU should be able to stand independent of the US. \n\n>How will the west stand up to Russia without the US\n\nHow do you say \"don't put all your eggs in one basket\" in German? Trump has been pushing for more NATO spending since his last term. Jokes aside I don't see the US actually abandoning any pre-2022 obligations. Pushing the European powers to take over the their own defense is prudent for all involved. If Russia legitimately threatens the west, we will be there. But Ukraine isn't the west and the narrative of this burgeoning Russian imperialism is silly. We've already covered their lacking capabilities to push into the first country next to them. It's not happening. \n\n>How will the US stand without allies?\n\nQuite easily. Make no mistake, whenever the US is involved in a NATO operation, it is significantly less fluid and effective than if we just did the whole thing ourselves. The reason we include a coalition is to provide an appearance of widespread international support. The actual manpower and capabilities brought to bear are nice but not mission critical. Allies are great and we do benefit from international friends, but an alliance is not a suicide pact nor is it a requirement to play follow the leader. Remember that a number of NATO states declined to participate in the Iraq War, which was a pretty good call all things considered.",

The problem is he hasn't stated a single concession that Putin would have to give up.\n\nWhen Trump keeps saying to Zelenskyy that he doesn't have the cards, if the US has any cards, why can't they extract a single concession from Russia?  \n\nThe idea this is bleeding the tax payer dry is a far fetched claim. It is interesting Trump cites numbers that are claimed by Russia and not numbers from his own Department - the US Department of Defence states it is about $183 billion in aid (military equipment, loans, grants, and humanitarian aid).  While the US is the single largest supporter as an individual country, the EU has provided a larger portion of aid and there are lots of nations providing more per capita of GDP than the US. \n\nIf you think it is not worth your tax dollars going to it - fine (many of us do pay taxes and are fine with it). That ought to be the argument and Trump should just say that we aren't interested in Ukraine/European interests, we will go our own way. The problem is, the US broadly doesn't want that because it comes with a cost to their economy as well. \n\nWhy should Trump's word be enough to back a deal? He hasn't shown it to be enough in any other deal (Trump made the USMCA deal with Canada/Mexico and is now backing out of it, calls it a bad deal, etc...). \n\nThe idea that Ukraine should just capitulate to Trump's demands with no security guarantee because Russia wouldn't like that and trust peace will be guaranteed because Trump says so is laughable.  Trump blames Zelenskyy/Ukraine for this war - if Russia just continued, why wouldn't we expect Trump to blame them again?  If the US won't provide some guarantee now (except a \"trust us bro\"), what incentive does Ukraine have? \n\nBefore you say \"peace\", they aren't even guaranteed that in this deal - peace comes to Ukraine with a security guarantee, not through a \"trust me bro\". \n\nUkraine has tried almost every other path. They tried bilateral negotiation with Russia. They engaged with deals with other nations with various agreements and treaties. They tried the constitutional guarantee of being \"neutral\" (agreed they wouldn't attempt to join NATO, contingent on Russia respecting their sovereignty).  None of these have worked.   What else is left for them to try if they want to have a Ukraine that can be free of Russia?",

And to go on and on and on about \u201cRussia Russia Russia\u201d and \u201cPutin went through a lot with me\u201d and Hunter Biden and Hillary Clinton and then at some point even Iran and Gaza??

I mean does Trump not strike you as so unbelievably vapid and vein? And to do all this knowing that cameras are rolling? Crushed my expectations for this deal. \n\nIf a deal eventually happens, I\u2019d imagine Ukraine\u2019s terms are going to be unfair and vulnerable to another Russian attack in the future, while at the same time we essentially rob them of rare earth minerals.

The man just wants security assurances in case of another invasion. He says it all the time. It\u2019s the number one priority for Ukraine in exchange for their land, their rare earth minerals, and, if it came down to it, Zelenskyy\u2019s job as president. All he did during that press conference was try to make the case for that. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\n>I don\u2019t know.\n\nJust take a guess. Why would Trump think it\u2019s a *good* thing to air that out in public? A steelman argument could maybe be that Trump thinks it\u2019s frustrating negotiating with Zelenskyy, and so he wanted to show that frustrating process with the American people, which would maybe get Zelenskyy to concede more in negotiations after public support in Zelenskyy potentially drops? I mean, genuinely asking, do you think that could be it?",

I wonder if you ever wonder why these conversations are so cherished by Trump? But no matter. I was gong to end things here and not belabour your patience anymore , because you\u2019ve honestly been very Interesting and patient to discuss with. I appreciate that. But just now, a pro Trump supporter acquaintance of mine, who is quite wealthy and has a lot of business interests that this administration is good for, posted the following on FB and it surprised me. And so, if you care to - no obligation- would you share your thoughts on this? I\u2019m genuinely interested in your feedback, if you care to reply: \n\nLooking back at JD Vance\u2019s berating of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy yesterday about diplomacy with Russia\u2014only for Trump to jump in and repeatedly say, \u201cYou don\u2019t hold the cards\u201d\u2014we actually witnessed Trump losing The Deal in real time, in his office, in-front of Ameria and the world.\n\nThe entire discussion about the Ukraine minerals deal unfolded in the last 10 minutes before the agreement was set to be signed and before lunch. In those crucial moments, Trump made his pitch: Let\u2019s take $500 billion of your minerals, we\u2019ll invest in your infrastructure, sign now, and trust me\u2014I\u2019ll get Putin to a peace deal.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: Trump explicitly ruled out future U.S. weapons support. His entire offer rested on trust me and trust diplomacy. He kept insisting, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d repeating it so much that Zelenskyy mockingly replied, \u201cI\u2019m not playing cards.\u201d\n\nAnd then came the real moment of failure. Frustrated that Zelenskyy wouldn\u2019t yield, Trump let his emotions get the better of him. In an amateur move, he abruptly told Zelenskyy to leave the White House\u2014blowing a $500 billion deal in just 10 minutes. It could be one of the fastest losses of money in history.\n\nAnd the irony? Zelenskyy\u2019s refusal didn\u2019t just block a bad deal\u2014it awakened Europe and Canada, pushing them to step up and potentially shape a stronger NATO-like alliance that could counter Russia more effectively.\n\nTrump, the self-proclaimed \u201cgreatest dealmaker,\u201d got outmaneuvered\u2014by a former actor turned wartime president. His much-touted Art of the Deal? More like The Art of Losing a Deal.\n\nAmerica lost this round. Europe won. And let\u2019s be real: the idea that the U.S. would ever go into \u201cbusiness\u201d with Moscow is a non-starter\u2014voters would never allow it. So in the end, Trump lost, in his own White House, in front of the world. And that\u2019s the real headline.\n\nAsk yourself this question, who wanted \u201cthis deal more? Trump or Zelenskyy? The answer is Trump, and if Trump can still remember the Art of the deal, \u201cRUSSIA KILLS, and Time Kills all deals. So there you have it. ,\u201d \n\nDo you agree with any of this?",

Diplomatic agreements are not binding into perpetuity. Agreements get rewritten, regarded upon and discarded all the time. Trump was very open during this process.\n\nThat's a far cry from suggesting that Trump would make a diplomatic agreement with intent to not honor it. Trump is a pragmatist. He's encouraging Ukraine to sign a minerals deal that is generous to the US so the US will have a real stake in Ukraine and be a more solid security guarantee.\n\n> Your position seems to be that that Ukraine should trust that the US has their best interests at heart\n\nNo, absolutely not. Ukraine should trust that the US has the US' interests at heart. As Ukraine should have Ukraine's interests at heart. Zolenskyy going in acting like he's being insulted by the US pushing for peace is silly because as a national leader he should always be prepared to defend Ukraine's interests against other nations. He should have been prepared a long time ago for the aid to stop, dwindle or falter and been prepared to make the necessary deals and assurances to keep it going.\n\nUkraine could win from the negotiation process too... such as by signing a sweetheart deal with the US that guarantees future doors for cooperation between the two countries.\n\nImagine how different things would have been if Zolenskyy had negotiated with the US and not moralized about Ukraine's position in the war.",

Truly a Great, and good Man.\n\n>I\u2019m not arguing that he will betray Zelenskyy, just that Zelenskyy wants security assurances and Trump won\u2019t give them, so the only way for Zelenskyy to trust Trump is to trust that Trump will be ride or die with Zelenskyy if he gets a mineral deal. \n\nPerhaps you should offer your negotiating services to Zelensky.\n\n> Zelenskyy trusting Trump is unlikely to happen, and Trump is offering nothing but his word. I\u2019m not arguing with your points or your belief system or whatever, just asking if you are approaching this from a game theory perspective or an \u201canyone who trusts Trump benefits always\u201d perspective? Sounds like the latter so that\u2019s that. Thanks!\n\nTrump will put the USA first. If Zelensky thinks rejecting alignment with the USA's interests so Ukraine interests are the USA's interests, as a good game theorist, then he can gamble that.",

I'm not interested in working up that kinda report atm. \n\nI've already entertained your moving the topic many degrees off topic and I gotta draw the line somewhere.\n\n> And why did Trump appoint these people if they all suck? \n\nPrior to 2016, the suck degree and spineless, malicious, hate-filled, Uniparty nature of these types was not understood by most Reps, including Trump. It was discovered after the fact and took awhile to figure out the wide-spread nature of the problem.\n\nBut fortunately, the 2020 loss gave everyone 4 years to take what they learned, develop a plan, and build out the structure to fix it. \n\n> Why did he say they were the best when he was appointing them? \n\nA. He's a very supportive, positive, and kind man. \n\nB. They hadn't shown their true colors yet. It took the goodness of Trump to expose them. His tasking them to do good was like light to a vampire. He has a knack for polarizing the good to be their best, and the vile to show their true darkness.\n\n> And now they are the worst?\n\nYes, that's correct.",

Because Disloyalty = assured truth telling. But not Trump, he prefers loyal team members. More at 11.",

Do you think the US is sending checks to his personal bank account? \n\nIt isn\u2019t whataboutism, it\u2019s just strange that Zelensky gets these criticisms often from Trump Supporters but Putin doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s telling. \n\nlol it\u2019s not an excuse, logistically there is no way to hold fair elections in the middle of a hostile invasion. Again, this is common practice. \n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t explain anything. \n\nMy point is that doing things that didn\u2019t work in the past and trying them again in the hopes that they will work this time simply because \u201cit\u2019s a new year\u201d isn\u2019t a valid argument. There are reasons the war on terror didn\u2019t have the intended effect we desired, it wouldn\u2019t go any differently today than it did in 2003-2021. Simply saying \u201cwell it\u2019s 2025 now!\u201d Doesn\u2019t explain why it would happen differently. \n\nIf Putin broke the ceasefire before, he will do it again. You haven\u2019t explained why he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cNew year, new me\u201d isn\u2019t an argument.
