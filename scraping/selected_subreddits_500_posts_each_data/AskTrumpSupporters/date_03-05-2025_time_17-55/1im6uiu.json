Does the judge's decision to temporarily block DOGE's access to the Treasury meet that requirement?\n\n(3) And finally, does impeaching a federal judge for a ruling serve a purpose that isn't already provided for by the appeals process? If so, what is that purpose?\n\n**Edited bonus questions:**\n\n(4) It seems like  lot of Trump Supporters feel the judge should be impeached. If impeachment failed, would you support prosecution of the judge by the DOJ, assuming they had the time and resources?\n\n(5) If yes to 4, what should be the crime and punishment faced by the judge?",

Conservatives already have a Supreme Court supermajority, so it's surprising to see so much whining already about temporary freezes from lower courts, etc., but regardless, don't we all want to still live in a democracy where there's rule of law, and the three (intentionally) *co-equal* branches retain their powers per the Constitution? I know I do.\n\nI have my qualms for sure with modern leftism, same for conservatism, and the kind of echo-chamber, tribalistic division that is pushing people away from the reality a majority of Americans agree on plenty of things (sometime differing on the paths to get there, but still), but my main opposition by far to Trumpism is with what is a clear disrespect for the Constitutional order. JD Vance, et al., per the Constitution - something him and Trump both swore to uphold is *dead wrong* trying to suggest Trump can just ignore court orders/judges - do we all at least agree on that, regardless of where we fall politically? I also know I do.",

He *did* continue an attempt at some forgiveness with a very watered down program that's known [known as SAVE, ](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan)which basically is supposed to allow lower and middle income borrowers to make a certain amount of minimum payments over a certain amount of years, and even if they didn't meet the total the rest of the loan(s) would then be forgiven.\n\nSAVE was of course also immediately challenged in court - AFAIK it just hasn't reached the SCOTUS again, where it maybe (probably, honestly) will even be overturned, in favor of students paying the total outright on outrageously high-interest loans sold to them before their brains were fully developed after having \"you'll be a failure if you don't go to college\" drummed in their heads.\n\nWere you aware of either of those facts, and the context? Biden didn't ignore the courts at all - he went from attempting to straight up writing off $10 to 20k of loan debt for each borrower, to a much weaker program requiring tons of payments for a hope of some small forgiveness, once the SCOTUS ruled against him, knowing full well that program could be challenged up to SCOTUS again (and it is, currently).\n\nAlso, did any judge rule Biden was in contempt of any court by continuing with that watered down program? No, and so do you see the difference between all this and outright ignoring court order(s)? Especially when taking actions the Constitution explicitly states only the Congress can?",

In my opinion (and I'm not a lawyer but I have been trained in legal reading in contract disputes) is that the exception is only for employees of the department, I.E. members of the civil service. The Secretary of the Treasury is a part of the Treasury Department but is also a named class (political appointee) that is bound by the order. There is no exception for him, in my opinion.\n\nI've stated my opinion on this, I'm sorry but I'm not going to debate this point further.",

So, in order to stop any more possible mishandling from happening, the judge ordered everybody to get their hands off.

And that judges typically will appease defendants and clarify motions just to ensure all parties fully understand an order? \n\nThe order was very clear as Judge Vargas just ruled:\n\n>In entering the TRO, it was Judge Engelmayer\u2019s **clear intention**, as had been requested, to maintain the status quo that existed prior to the adoption of the Agency Action described in the Complaint until such time as a hearing could be held on the preliminary injunction motion.\n\nJudge Vargas only agreed to clarify because that\u2019s just what judges do to ensure all parties fully understand an order. The DOJ was just playing dumb. Any 1st year law student could understand that the order didn\u2019t apply to the Treasury Secretary for a couple of reasons:\n\nFirst, the order explicitly was in answer to a complaint about the NEW policy, which means that any EXISTING policies are not even considered. As Judge Engelmayer\u2019s order clearly stated:\n\n>The State\u2019s lawsuit challenges a **new policy** by the United States Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury, which, as alleged, expands access to the payment systems of the Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) to political appointees and \u201cspecial government employees.\u201d \n\nThe complaint was specifically about this NEW policy extending NEW access to \u201cpolitical appointees.\u201d It had nothing to do with EXISTING access that was already being given to \u201cpolitical appointees,\u201d yet the DOJ seized upon the phrase \u201cpolitical appointees\u201d and pretended they had no idea it didn\u2019t include the Treasury Secretary, who, as a \u201cpolitical appointee,\u201d has always had access. So nothing changes for him. The order does not include him. And the DOJ knows damn well it doesn\u2019t include him. At least they should know that if they\u2019re even halfway competent lawyers because they would have seen countless orders with similar language during their careers.\n\nSecond, the order specifically called out those who could not be granted access and specifically stated that the order only applies to those \u201coutside the Treasury department\u201d:\n\n>restrained from granting access to all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency **outside the Treasury Department**\n\nThe motion was all just theater by the DOJ. Do you honestly think that the DOJ lawyers can\u2019t understand the language of a simple order? Would those be the kind of lawyers you\u2019d think Trump would put in place?",

Prior to even responding to this thread I had already formed my opinion, and I responded as such based on what I knew at the time. I don't know who was first to say what or whatever and honestly I could not care less, my entire stance was predicated on the Secretary of the Treasury being barred from doing his job. As people came in with different points, I followed up on their points of view, even reading the order myself and based on my reading, agreed with the original article that I posted. It seems like my objection is resolved and so my opinion of the right course of action changes too. Not every TS is a blind ideologue.\n\nI do appreciate your more positive response.
