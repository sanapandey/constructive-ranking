Weapons such as mines and cluster bombs were outright banned from being sent due to hope inhumane they were.\n\nNow, a month into Trump\u2019s presidency, we\u2019re sending Israel [2000 pound bombs](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/rubio-arms-israel.html) as they actively illegally occupy the West Bank.

A nation becomes an ally when it shares mutual interests, goals, or values with another, often formalized through agreements like treaties or pacts. It\u2019s less about sentiment and more about a practicality strategic, economic, or ideological alignment. To the people who say Israel is an ally are just brainwashed by Jewish media or paid by Jewish lobbyists groups. I ask them, what has Israel done for us that benefits us? Not a damn thing.",

Israel was planning to attack Iraq before 9/11. How convenient it is that this attack happens which gave the U.S. government plausible cause to invade Iraq. So when people talk about the military-industrial complex, the state of Israel and the intelligence community are part of it.",

I think Israel offensive military aid whether conditional or not is not justified at this point because they are committing an ethnic cleansing and genocide. I\u2019m ok with conditional defensive military aid for Israel though.",

We sent them 3 billion in 2023 to help with a war they can definitely win vs we sent 16 billion in 2023 to Ukraine to help a war they can\u2019t win. In total we\u2019ve sent about 70 billion to Ukraine so it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t support them. It\u2019s we *have* already supported them a lot, and the war has been at a stalemate, so how much do we want to keep on spending? Maybe someone else could pick up the tab? For all its talk, the EU has spent more money on Russian oil than they spent on aid to Ukraine. https://news.yahoo.com/european-union-spent-more-russian-183447300.html\n\nSo I\u2019d say the US has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest supporter and also we have been the only one to propose a peace deal. \n\nWe didn\u2019t want to send too powerful of weapons to Ukraine because Russia threatened to escalate against us numerous times. If hamas had nukes we\u2019d also be real hesitant on what we sent to Israel at all. These are just the different realities of the two different conflicts. Our government\u2019s first responsibility is always to us so we can never risk escalation of a conflict.\n\nEdit: also Americans were killed and taken hostage on October 7 so we had more skin in the game in that conflict",

A nation whose existence relies on us to prop them up doesn\u2019t need to be propped up in perpetuity. I\u2019m Jewish, I love Israel, but I\u2019m an American, not Israeli and my home country has every right to be free of propping up any other government. I\u2019m just less concerned about Israel due to the immense benefit we receive contrasted with the relatively low expenditure of attaining those benefits.\n\nOur continued involvement in the Ukrainian side of this war on the other hand is likely to draw us into war with Russia, which will pull in N. Korea and China and frankly the only people who should support that are people willing and able to pick up a rifle and fight that war.",

It would be too antagonistic having Ukraine as a formal ally when they are so close to Russia, and so the geopolitical compromise was for Ukraine to remain neutral to both Russia and the US. \n\nThat's why Ukraine never put in a formal request to join NATO until now---because why would Ukraine remain neutral when Russia is currently invading it?\n\nSo I guess my question is: Doesn't your opinion lack nuance if the only thing you consider are written agreements rather than the context behind why the state of political affairs are currently the way they are?",

Israel **BUYS** munitions from American manufacturers subject to approval by the State Department.\n\nAllowing a sale to take place is an entirely different prospect from whether we should donate munitions at the US Taxpayer's expense.\n\nSecond, the better question is asking what we expect the next round of aid to Ukraine to accomplish? What strategic goals does it serve?\n\nIs your goal to evict the Russian troops from occupied Ukraine? Because that's not happening. There's nothing we can send to Ukraine except American troops that will return the annexed territory. Period.\n\nIf we can't hope to win, why are we still fighting? \n\nAs I see it, our only attainable war goal is the preservation of the remaining 80% of Ukraine. If Russia is willing to entertain a ceasefire, we accomplsh that goal.\n\nThousands of conscripts a month are getting maimed or killed to maintain the stalemate. We OWE a very persuasive justification to continue the war if peace is an option.\n\n>Weapons such as mines and cluster bombs were outright banned from being sent due to hope inhumane they were.\n\nThat's not the problem. Lets say whatever bombs we send have a 1% failure rate. If you drop 100 normal  bombs you can expect one \"dud\" that doesn't explode, but remains dangerous after the war. We're still finding WW1 munitions in western europe. **The problem** with cluster munitions is that 100 bombs release 60,000 bomblets and if 1% fail that's 600 unexploded munitions that get buried and can take off a limb decades after a ceasefire. \n\nAgain, I ask the same question. What did we expect the addition of cluster munitions late in the war to accomplish? It didn't move the frontlines. Both sides are fully entrenched with very little exchange of territory since the first year of the war. The ONLY thing they added to the equation are a long-term civilian hazard without changing the military outlook.\n\nI don't need to justify Israeli arms purchases. Ben does to the Israeli taxpayer, but that's his business.\n\nI did support sending Aid to Ukraine so that it could halt the Russian advance and (successfully) reclaim a lot of lost territory. What I don't support, is open-ended spending that noone thinks will change the outcome of any eventual peace deal. If we can't change that final outcome we should save a lot of death and suffering and do it now.",

That is true of all words. Israel is justified in it's actions against Gaza since Oct 7th. The people of Gaza can stop all the violence at any time by rounding up all the perpetrators of Oct. 7th and delivering them to Israel and then tearing down the infrastructure of terror that Hamas built.\n\nGenocide means killing all of a race or creed of people.
