    "selftext": "So, this is a bit of a funny question, I admit, but when you think of American food, what do you think of?\n\nI understand that America is a very big place and that cuisine can vary a lot from location to location, so if you want to suggest some regional foods from your area, go for it.  I also know that, due to the \"melting pot\" of America (at least in the past), a lot of things take inspiration from a lot of non-American cuisines.  After all, we would not have the hamburger without Hamburg steak.\n\nSo what do you think is American food?",

George Motz has a hamburger museum (and he's somewhat entertaining on YouTube), and just how regional things are regarding BORGOR is really interesting.\n\nBarbecue, I would say, is an American food.  It has a ton of influences from enslaved people, natives, etc., but I have written a treatise on barbecue in America.  Quite literally, if you drive a few hours from where I live, you will find distinctly different styles of barbecue, with different meats and rubs and sauces and all that.  Alabama, what are you doing with chicken?  Also, my wife's buddies are begging me to make them another brisket, so I guess I gotta do what I do best.\n\nBut American food, to me, is very regional.  Most people don't know what hotdish is, but if you were a \"country boy\" living in the Midwest, you'd be freaking happy to get what is basically a casserole that is sort of a shephard's pie and it would fill you up.  When I lived in California for a summer, I was foraging uni as much as I could, because why not?\n\nI think, if I have to choose, the most American food I can think of is turkey, because it is indigenous to America and is kind of a family portrait kind of thing.  Also, I love a good turkey.  Hmm.  Might have to get one and smoke it this week.",

The foods, ingredients, and techniques have evolved within that blend, making it unique rather than just an offshoot of one country\u2019s cuisine. Even \u201cMexico\u201d itself, as a nation, was shaped by multiple influences\u2014Spain, Nueva Espa\u00f1a, France, and long before that, the Aztec, Maya, and many other Indigenous civilizations. Southwest food developed independently while sharing similarities across the region, including parts of Mexico. It\u2019s a little cultural insensitive and ignorant of you to just call it all \u201cMexican\u201d. Even the cuisine across Mexico varies widely in different regions. \n\nAs for your last point, what do you mean by this administration not wanting an association with anything culturally related to Mexico or the Southwest? Being tough on illegal immigration is a legal issue, not a cultural one. There\u2019s a long history of cross-border cultural exchange, and enforcement of immigration law doesn\u2019t erase or diminish that shared heritage. Are you suggesting that current policies are targeting the culture itself rather than addressing border security? If so, I\u2019d be interested to hear specific examples.\n\nI\u2019ve spent extended periods of time in Mexico, over a year in total. Absolutely love Mexico! If I was traveling there illegally, not on a proper visa, I expect the Mexican authorities to arrest me.. and I wouldn\u2019t blame this on Mexicans having something against my American Culture, but that I broke the law.",
