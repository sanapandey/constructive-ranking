    "selftext": "I feel like ever since he started putting Canada in his crosshairs during the campaign, I saw TS treat NS like they were being too easily triggered or trolled when they took seriously the notion that Trump wanted to annex Canada. I don't just mean this sub but a quick search of Canada threads from the last year will I believe corroborate this characterization. Now I feel like the vibe has shifted and I'm seeing more TS here and elsewhere treat that likes it's a clear and desirable endgame for the tariffs. What do you think? Is this about fentanyl, or banking, or trade? Or is this, as Trudeau publicly opined earlier, all about attempting to annex Canada?",

I\u2019d actually be in favor of the complete elimination of all tariffs between the US and Canada. \n\nWhat do I think the point is? Some combination of Trump sincerely (and, generally speaking, incorrectly) thinking that tariffs directly benefit the US and for a tool in other negotiations (e.g., the Northern Border). That feels misguided to me too. Canada should work with us to ensure the Northern Border is secure, but focusing on it to the point you slap a 25% tariff on them when Mexico is the far bigger problem is like worrying about a spider when there\u2019s a bear in your house. \n\nApologies for the run on sentence lol I\u2019m on a walk",

Does that implicate the quality of his other decisions? Is he getting really really bad information and advice? Or is he getting good advice but ignoring it? I can't help be feel this is a microcosm of a larger issue.",

They can remove them and avoid all the reciprocal tariffs in April. \n\nMarch's tariffs are about Fentanyl. Fentanyl is a huge deal no matter how much Democrats try to minimize it. The amount coming from Canada is enough to kill millions of Americans. Just because it's not the same amount as Mexico which can kill *every* American doesn't mean it's not a crisis. I wish Democrats would find better talking points. \n\nSpeaking of talking points, I\u2019m getting whiplash between the claim that \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t understand tariffs hurt the country imposing them\u201d and the argument that \u201cAmerica is attacking its allies\u201d by applying them.\n\nSo which is it? If tariffs hurt us, how are they an attack on them? And if nearly everyone had tariffs on us before, were they all attacking themselves?\n\nWhy is it acceptable for other countries to impose tariffs on us, fine when we have none on them, but a crisis when we make them...reciprocal?\n\nAnd if tariffs cause inflation, why hasn\u2019t China been drowning in it after decades of extreme tariffs and trade barriers?\n\nI'm not even sure where the inflation narrative comes from. [Empirically](https://x.com/jaltucher/status/1896939842929578315) it hasn't historically. China tariffs netted out pretty neutral. Most historical implementations I've analyzed are neutral to mildly deflationary. \n\nIf anything a reciprocal tariff policy is ironically a game theoretic smart way to tear down tariffs multi-laterally. \n\nFrankly it feels like Democrat media are the one trying to incite retribution to hurt Trump through hurting America.

Your two points aren't mutually exclusive, both can be true. The tariffs Trump's applying can hurt USA and it can hurt Canada.\n\n\nAside from that I have a question about your view of the \"democratic media\". Do you think it was sad when right wing media like Fox were constantly trying to hurt Biden when he was president or is it only bad when people attack Trump? Don't you think it's the job of media to scrutinise and robustly hold to account those in power? Would you prefer a fawning media and unchecked power for politicians?",

I also credit people on the left for CORRECTLY realizing that he was in cognitive decline and pressuring him not to run again, albeit far later than they should have (I wouldn't have had him run the FIRST time - I want new, fresh, young, SMART people with data-driven ideas running the country). It's really hard to imagine MAGA doing the same and pressuring trump in any sort of way as he gets more and more unhinged and stupid...\n* My overall viewpoint across the board is \"do better - everyone\"\n\nBut, a \"pitiful and mediocre\" legacy of maintaining a failing status-quo is far better than the absolute psychosis that is trump being president. And I think the cult of personality around him is obviously highly disturbing - while some democrats are certainly very tribal and defensive of biden, the maga flag-flying trump-is-god cult is in my opinion far worse, but at the very minimum equally bad. I find that MAGA claims to be \"superior\" but VERY OFTEN openly descends into \"well biden did it too.\" Isn't your god-king supposed to be BETTER than that? not every time he does something corrupt going to \"but biden did it too\"?\n\nI would ask - do you feel MAGA is capable of taking a big step back, putting aside equivalencies about Biden, and actually seeing trump with clear eyes for what he is? they can BOTH be bad, lol. Even if you think he's a means to an end, sitting back and looking at him and examining whether he truly cares about poor people or about the future of this country? And about whether he himself, at 78 or whatever, is actually in cognitively good shape or is likely to be \"sharp as a tack\" himself by end of his term?",

Things adjust, and everything is more expensive than it was before, but it eventually \"evens out,\" so while saying tariffs cause inflation is technically true, it's a bit misleading.\n\n> If anything a reciprocal tariff policy is ironically a game theoretic smart way to tear down tariffs multi-laterally. \n\nI'd be interested in seeing the proof here. A reciprocal tariff policy is the game-theoretic response to tariffs, but it's never a good policy to unilaterally declare tariffs (at least in the majority of economists opinion). The fact that a tit-for-tat is the accepted response is the reason for the reciprocal tariffs being declared back on us.\n\n> Frankly it feels like Democrat media are the one trying to incite retribution to hurt Trump through hurting America.

The consumer gets his money from either owning or working in a local business with a good salary and benefits. That is a functioning win/win transactional system. The money is spent locally and the money that is spent is used locally to pay good wages. It's a functioning closed circle. This closed circle can scale to a national level.\n\nThe circle is working for the nation. People are making enough money and spending enough money that everyone wins. This nation is more prosperous and successful than other nations in the world. Workers are able to work less hours in better conditions and kids can go to school and old people can retire if they wabt to.\n\nNow lets add imports to the closed loop thought experiment. Products that are made cheaply show up in stores and consumers love them except the ones whose livelihood is making those products in the closed loop. The consumers money earned is no longer going back in the loop. That money is going to a different country. Many of the owners of businesses cannot compete and move their business to the place with less cost to produce. Now the loop is missing or has greatly reduced whole sectors of businesses like textile and steel and auto-making. Many consumers have to accept less salary or change jobs. The result is tightened spending budgets, less or no benefits and going into debt. Consumer products are cheaper so life goes on devolving into worse circumstances for each generation of consumer/workers.\n\nThe fix is to introduce tariffs with imports. The cheaper import plus tariffs now compete with circle businesses instead of destroying them. A small percentage of consumer money will leave the circle but that is offset by lower taxes. Consumers never pay cheaper prices so they don't pay higher prices for the tariffs. Consumers always pay closed loop prices.\n\nNow if globalist people do not like the closed loop and want to destroy it they bring in the cheap goods without the tariffs. If this goes on for a hundred years there will be some consumer price pain while prices adjust back up to closed loop standards",
