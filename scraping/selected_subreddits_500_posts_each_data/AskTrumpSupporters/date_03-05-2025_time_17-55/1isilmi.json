They get around the DEI thing by pretending to be DEI. They have a job then start interviewing; their policy is that they only have to interview a DEI person. So, they randomly pick a completely unqualified person who applied and interview them. Check the box then hire based on the unconscienced bias/conscience bias and the teams stay mostly white males with Asian occasionally showing up. Now when what you would call a DEI hire does apply that is completely or overqualified for the position and a perfect fit, they don't even select them as a candidate and that doesn't violate policy.

I\u2019d presume it\u2019s the MSM, who in turn get it from talking points memos and the like.  \n\nWhere do you think the NPC meme came from and why it was so popular?  It\u2019s because of this very thing, where there\u2019s a firmware update and now there\u2019s a new talking point uploaded, or even a complete position reversal. \n\nIt also means there\u2019s often little substance to engage with behind the canned talking points.  Because we\u2019re talking to the actor performing the lines and not the script writer who authored them. \n\nWhile I accept that the same charge could technically be leveled at some in the Right to much lesser degree, the difference I\u2019ve seen is that when there\u2019s a new rightwing talking point, it\u2019s often integrated into the larger picture of right wing views.  So you can talk beyond them.  Whereas the left wing points are standalone items and there\u2019s nothing beyond their surface-level point scoring.  \n\n\nIt\u2019s been my experience that it\u2019s fairly easy to exhaust the talking point and find no substance beyond it.  I\u2019ve also noticed they also seem to rely heavily on subject ignorance to appear logical.",

Perhaps not by hiring DEI workers, but instead maybe setting aside federal or state funds for the purposes of helping people advance in whichever career field they choose through free or low cost education/training?  Or do you believe they should be left on their own to find a path toward advancement?",

We provide good meals, and both male and female guidance. Most importantly, we indoctrinate the child with values such as education is the top priority. We might have to, do I dare say it, restrict their access to the internet until they are adults.\n\nBut this must come from parents, not government.",

What I said was directly related to your question. Your interpretation, that I was referring to illegals working for the government, was completely unrelated to what I said (since I never said illegals were working for the federal government). \n\n* If the government passed a law tomorrow giving American citizenship to all Chinese people in the world, I wouldn't say \"aw shucks, I guess every institution needs to be overwhelmingly Chinese\". I would say \"time to repeal that awful law!\". Same underlying principle.",

Particularly when it regards people\u2019s safety. And Boeing should be investigated and brought to justice for criminal negligence. \n\nBut as far as I understand it - the qualifications for a job in aviation is the same no matter your race, gender, etc. \n\nThe goal of DEI is diversity. Which is fine. But the policies are about making *a good faith effort* to expand the hiring pool beyond personal bias and to also consider a candidate\u2019s soft skills, which are often informed by their upbringing and cultural background. Soft skills have merit  - though, it\u2019s harder to measure. Pretty much every study proves such policies make a business more competitive. \n\nAre there cases in which DEI policies end up entirely too performative? Totally, absolutely. And it\u2019s stupid. And theres a lot to scale back in federal government. \n\nI think there\u2019s a lot TS and NS can agree on for this issue - I don\u2019t see why this has to be so polarized. Plenty of room in the middle to meet, would you agree?",
