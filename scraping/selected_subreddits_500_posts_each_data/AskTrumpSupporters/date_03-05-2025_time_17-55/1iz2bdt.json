Do you know we give billions of dollars to Afghanistan? And yet we left behind all of that equipment, which wouldn't have happened. We were getting out under me, I'm the one that got it down to 5,000 people. We were going to get out, but we were going to keep Bagram. Not because of Afghanistan, but because of China, because it's exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.\n\n([41:15](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Ih264UX9Rs9UgTKGjLaGnCggJ6q0Ew3p3dGPSzJDYpshfE_DiyBDqgKA2wDJganZ5kfb8P5C8dLZa77DLiHxHrrEnwU?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2475.69))  \nSo we were going to keep Bagram. We were going to keep a small force on Bagram, we were going to have Bagram Air Base, one of the biggest air bases in the world, one of the biggest runways, one of the most powerful runways in the sense that it was very heavy concrete and steel. You could carry about anything. You could land anything on those runways. We gave it up. And you know who's occupying it right now? China. China. Biden gave it up. So we were going to keep that, and we were going to have a withdrawal, and we're going to take our equipment. We were going to do it properly, we were going to do it very\u2026 We were going to keep the equipment. Well, they ran out. What happened there was a dis\u2026\n\n[https://www.rev.com/transcripts/white-house-cabinet-meeting](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/white-house-cabinet-meeting)",

I think Afghanistan was more justified because after 9/11, the American people were ready to invade any country since they were out for blood and revenge. Hyperbole btw, I do believe Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan though.\n\nMy point is that yes it\u2019s true that we have hundreds of military base in the world. I think this bloated military budget is bad for the debt and of course it can be more efficient if the price gouging stop, but cutting it could also mean closing those military base. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s in America interest, because considering how intertwined our global dominance and economy is, I am to believe we wouldn\u2019t be the greatest country in the world if we retreat and become too isolationist.",
