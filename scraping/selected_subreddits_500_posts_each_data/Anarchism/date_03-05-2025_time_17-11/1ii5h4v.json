    "selftext": "We know taxes fund a standing army, police, prisons, bombs etc. and on top of that when we pay taxes we submit to State authority, we say \"you exist and I am your subject.\" A reason most pay taxes, probably, is the consequences the State would inflict if you didn't pay taxes (prison). As anarchists, in order to be aligned with our consciences, should we not pay taxes and accept whatever consequences the State throws at us? \nI don't mean to be too obstinate, idealistic (or practical). This question is troubling me after reading Thoreau's Civil Disobedience and Tolstoy's The Law of Love & Violence",

Like the state DGAF about you but for your ability to pay them money and once you stop doing that you stop having value to them and you get treated accordingly.\n\nModernity is, unfortunately, kind of a devil's bargain in that we are forced to contribute to and support the systems that crush people and torch the planet if we want the bare necessities of survival.\n\nIf it really bothers you that much, there are ways you can live where you pay no taxes but it means being dirt poor your whole life and that gets...harder as you get older.",

Unless you are self-employed, income tax is paid automatically by your employer and taken straight out of your pay check. You only have to file your own tax return if you have additional sources of income (i.e. a self-employed job or capital holdings generating income), or if you need to pay capital gains tax.\n\nIn any case, I don't see it as a standout issue. If one takes the position that states are bad, you can either accept living in a situation that doesn't conform to your ideals and trying to change it, or attempt to totally remove yourself from the system. Not paying your taxes might be a version of the former, but it's probably less powerful than trying to persuade other people to share your views.\n\nResistance can be effective as a group, or it can be effective if it's symbolic, headline-grabbing and generates sympathy (one person killed by the state for trying to do the right thing kind of vibes). I think not paying your taxes falls into neither group.",
