The cycle of violence has persisted for generations and shows no signs of abating until actions aimed at fostering peace replace those rooted in destruction.\n\nIn 2005, Israel withdrew entirely from Gaza, leaving governance to the Palestinian Authority. However, Hamas' rise to power in Gaza has since contributed to ongoing tensions, often exacerbated by external actors such as Iran. Decades of rocket attacks and border skirmishes created a fragile status quo, which ultimately collapsed with the events of October 7th. The scale and brutality of this recent attack have pushed Israel to respond with unprecedented force.\n\nNeither Israel nor the broader Muslim population is going away. Sustainable peace depends on both sides coming to the table, setting aside the rhetoric of annihilation, and working toward coexistence. Without this, the cycle of violence will continue to consume future generations.",

There is one clear aggressor here and from what I can tell from your comment you haven\u2019t really thought about what it means that Israel was able to do what you see in these pictures to Gaza. What kind of power dynamic exists. You are talking about religious differences. If you stop there, you have bought the lie. This is apartheid.\n\nA place to start in order to understand would be to get an understanding of what we mean when we say apartheid, and to understand the difference between the Israeli government, supported by the US and the corporate interested it represents and defends (materially, not just symbolically) and Palestinian existence. If you understand this you will understand that, for instance, Iran supporting Hamas is not a meaningful parallel to the US supporting Israel. Because there meaningful analogy to be drawn between the US and Iran, or Israeli gov and Hamas.",
