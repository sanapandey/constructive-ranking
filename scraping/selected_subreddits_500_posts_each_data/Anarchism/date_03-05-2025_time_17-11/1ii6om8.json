I was pretty close to falling asleep when I heard a bunch of banging on my door and when I checked it was the cops. I was so confused so I let them in and talked to them, they told me they heard some DV shit. I\u2019m not even sure how they got into my complex. I\u2019m just confused ",

Next time, when you see it's the cops, take a moment to collect yourself, ask if they have a warrant. If not, talk to them through the door to explain the situation. For your own safety, stay respectful, but stand your ground on your rights.\n\nStay safe comrade",
