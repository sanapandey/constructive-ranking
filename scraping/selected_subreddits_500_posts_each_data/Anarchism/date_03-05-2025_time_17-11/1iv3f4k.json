            "body": "I wanted to share this video because of the powerful impact it had on my mom, so if it can get through to her, probably it can for others, as well. \n\nAlthough my mom agrees that the health insurance industry is evil, her view was that political action should always be peaceful, period, no exceptions, and so she had a negative reaction to the assassination of the United Healthcare CEO. I argued with her about it but her opinion didn\u2019t budge. \n\nThen I showed her this video, which is only about 7 or 8 minutes long, but it very clearly lays out how violence is an integral part of the political action of the state and the capitalist class on a daily basis, and that this violence is used towards the oppression of the many for the power and enrichment of the few. It also makes the point that, for those who oppose the violence of this system, that opposition will be powerless if it only limits itself to nonviolent actions approved by the system.\n\nIt had a powerful impact on her and afterwards she admitted that it changed her mind about the assassination, and admitted that it was morally justified, even though she still feels uneasy about it. She even said that, although she hates to admit it, it might require a revolution to truly change things. She hopes we can do it peacefully, but is now at least willing to admit that it may not be enough.",

                                    "body": "We have seen examples of non-violent uprisings that successfully paralyzed the government and forced the president to resign within 18 days. At the height of it about 20-25% of the population refused to participate in the economy, and most of those actively participated in civil disobedience like sit-ins, strikes, sabotaged factories, shut down international ports, and many just hung out in public,  refusing to work. That's all you need; when 1 in 4 people don't work, the other 3 can't either. But it started with just a few people.\n\nIn the example I'm talking about, the Arab Spring and especially the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, class consciousness and leftist philosophy were barely known among the masses. If it had been far better known...  then they might not have settled simply for a new leader, but could have organized a decentralized government of local community and industry councils and directly put all the resources and means of production into the hands of all of its people.\n\nThis is why I think it is every leftist activist's responsibility to do what they can to not just organize their communities together to realize our shared power together,  but to spread understanding and experience in horizontal forms of organization. Prefigurative politics.  Dual power.  Ideas like a society based on mutual aid, without bosses, leaders, cops,  laws, and jails, while also ending poverty and all the suffering caused by the competitiveness and artificial scarcity that is fostered by hierarchical systems like money and centralized government.\n\nIf people have an idea that there are viable alternatives out there and have experience with them, then when the inevitable uprisings begin, violent or non-violent,  then they are far more likely to be successful in not just changing the leaders of our current system,  but changing the whole damned system. I think the likelihood of an anarchist revolution succeeding is directly tied to how peaceful it is, which I think is mostly dependent on having a majority of the population believing an alternative is worth trying. A mostly violent revolution is a magnet for power-hungry people and will likely always end in some kind of authoritarian system. I don't see a way around that.\n\nI don't have any illusions that it could be entirely done with non-violent tactics. Maybe somewhere like Denmark or New Zealand.  But in America, even if the people in government magnanimously decided to step down and dissolve the government, the billionaire's private militias would be happy to slaughter unarmed activists by the millions.\n\nWhich is why I strongly believe in anarchist community defense militias that are focused on mutual aid right now, to start networks of people who have worked alongside armed self-described anarchists in a horizontal organization focused on doing things like feeding the hungry. I joined one early last year, and that's a big part of what inspired this line of thought. I knew one way or another, Trump would be in the White House, and all kinds of authoritarians would be again emboldened to commit violence in vulnerable communities. I wanted to be trained and knowledgeable enough to protect my communities.\n\nIf there's 3 or 4 anarchist militias in every state, while things are relatively calm, and they are doing good works out in the community and doing it prefiguratively, then you're teaching through example and gaining people's trust, the most crucial thing,  while creating horizontal networks.  So when shit goes down,  neighborhoods will know, the anarchists have their back, even if they don't identify as one themselves. And they've learned from our example and create their own mutual aid networks.\n\nI know this because I've seen it. A great example is when the group I joined rented some powerful 4x4 vehicles and collected a ton of supplies and went to do disaster relief after last years hurricanes. Even after they ran out of supplies to give away,  they kept finding ways to help.  One time, the guys were picking up and delivering some generators into a town that was completely cut off from power,  water, and all emergency services and roads.. they were pretty far down FEMAs list. When the truck rolled in,  the people of the town recognized it. We'd been helping them for weeks already.  They didn't know we were bringing generators, but many ran to the vehicle a soon as they saw it. Some yelling,  \"the anarchists are back! The anarchists are back!\" like we were a liberating army in some nationalistic propaganda movie. People don't care what you call yourself as much as they care if you care about them.\n\nI think we should be more open, though.  The group I joined is very secretive, and I understand why.  But I think we need to increase people's awareness and understanding much quicker,  and I think the recipe for that is being openly militant,  loudly anarchist,  and focused on community defense and mutual aid.",
