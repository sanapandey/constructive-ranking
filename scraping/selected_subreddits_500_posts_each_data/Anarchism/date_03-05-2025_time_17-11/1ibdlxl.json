Unfortunately, if you need to learn more, you're not ready to spread the message - you get A LOT of kickback when you criticise the existing system, if you don't know how to argue your position you end up looking foolish and wasting the opportunity you had with that person. Educate yourself first. Worry about preaching it later.",
