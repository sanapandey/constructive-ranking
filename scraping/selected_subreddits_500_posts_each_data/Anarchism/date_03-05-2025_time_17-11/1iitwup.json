The French nobility were \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The Cuban plantation owners were \u00e9migr\u00e9s (but not the people fleeing the Cuban state today, duh).\n\n\nTo call working class people \"\u00e9migr\u00e9s\" is ridiculous and a bad use of language. Do better.",

It means someone who has emigrated.\n\nYou are correct that the word has often been applied to folks running away from a revolution they fear will not benefit them, but that's just one way to use the word.",
