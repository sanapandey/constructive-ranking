    "selftext": "We called off work for the big Day Without Immigrants protest tmrw, but I can't go to another fucking march (AFM). So I started thinking about what else I can do.\n\nAnd what I'm really wishing would happen, instead of AFM, is a neighborhood assembly where we can meet each other and talk about what to do if we see ICE.\n\nThe thing is... I just moved to this neighborhood a month ago. I don't know many people. I haven't even hung out with the other three people in my building yet (though I have their numbers). That's why I'm not just like \"I'm gonna go talk to X Y and Z and we'll start organizing the assembly!\"\n\nI'm just gonna start talking to people about the idea. Cuz.. so far no one else is doing it, and it clearly needs to get done. You don't have to be an anarchist to realize that.\n\nMy plan is to try to find nexus points in the neighborhood -- people who are connected to a lot of other people. Like bartenders is my first thought. Cafe and restaurant workers. Salon workers. I'm White, so I should probably prioritize anywhere with PoC workers.\n\nI think it'll be a pretty easy sell. People are really scared, and the best way to deal with fear, I think, is to prepare (and get people to know each other!!). People *want* something like this, even if they don't know it yet.\n\nOnce I get a few key people on board, I think it could pick up steam really quickly.\n\nFeel free to share feedback, constructive criticism or what you're doing instead of AFM!",
