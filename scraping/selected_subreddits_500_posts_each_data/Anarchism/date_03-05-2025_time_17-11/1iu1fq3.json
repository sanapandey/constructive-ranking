    "selftext": "so i decided to ask about your opinion here.\nrecently i saw the video that said \"system brainwashed people into thinking \"legal\" is right\". so i wrote that i agree and that also illegal doesn't always mean wrong\n\nbecause i wanted to highlight that some of the illegal actions shouldnt be criminalized, like unfortunately abortion rights in my country, humanitarian help, feeding homeless etc. these are all illegal things, that shouldnt be.\n\nBut I NEVER said that EVERY EACH thing that it's illegal, is a right thing to do. \n\nBUT yet for some reason people straight up started assuming that I support m3rd3r, and so on\ud83d\ude4e\u200d\u2640\ufe0f...... \n\ni explained what i meant but no one was even willing to read that\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they were just writing more and more comments that were making another and another assumptions about me:') and ofc none of them was reffering to my response:')\n\nidk maybe its on me, im not a native english speaker and im also autistic, so being misunderstood plays a hugeeee part in my life:') and its also triggering a lot. but it seems like it wasnt about that. but the fact the people simply think that: legal = good\ud83d\ude0d, illegal = bad\ud83e\udd2c, and no matter what you say, you cant change their mind",

Also, ppl can have individual hang ups, where they've deconstructed certain things, but still hold onto others. It's like Even though as an exmo atheist, I don't believe in God, I've drunk coffee and used CBD, swear, have no problem with sex work, support cop abolition and decriminalizing addiction, I don't have a single tattoo. Some things stick with you from the past, even though you've done a ton of work.\u00a0",

However, both of these still fall drastically short of universal ethical principles, because instead focusing on mere abstracts such as the law or social contract, it relies on human conscience.",

In the USA, people may give you a side eye if you don't hold the door open for them, it's a folk way and the sanction is a bit of social disapproval. But if you live in a polyamorous household it's unacceptable because \"society\" in this case is the Protestant ethic and Christian religious values, people will go so far as to harass you or have you investigated for polygamy. People have difficulty understanding it because laws can have such strong consequences it's unthinkable to challenge them sometimes.
