    "selftext": "So, i got a 20 yo cousin who still is in his edgy phase, and he wants to vote for a far right candidate in next elections in Poland. Im Bisexual, so part of LGBTQ, he said however that he doesn't like LGBT but respects them, he often makes anti semitic and racist jokes, I try to look like I dont care only giving him a look. What I ask u is, what are your tactics to get your friends on your side, maybe not outright support, its too fast, but at least inddiferene, guys Like my cousin are tired of the neo lib status quo and wants change, but he picks the wrong one.
