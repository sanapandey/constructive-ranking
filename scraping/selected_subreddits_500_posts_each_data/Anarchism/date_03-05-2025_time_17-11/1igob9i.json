We are moving backwards by supporting these two fascist wannabe Adolf Hitlers. \n\nIt\u2019s saddening to watch the world be conned into thinking these are good people, and I personally pray for the downfall of these two, but I don\u2019t see how it will be a good ending.\n\nDonald trump is going to cause another civil war, and this one will be 10x more deadly than the first.",
