They're terrible.\n\nHere's an accurate version:\n\nFreedom: The ability to act, think, and live without coercion or imposed hierarchy, bounded only by mutual reciprocity and respect for others' autonomy.\n\nDomination: The exertion of control over others through coercion, hierarchy, or systemic power, restricting their freedom and autonomy.\n\nForce: The exertion of power to influence or compel action, which can be coercive (domination) or non-coercive (self-defense, mutual aid).\n\nMetaphysics: The underlying assumptions and conceptual structures shaping how reality, existence, and human nature are understood, often influencing social and political thought.\n\nIdeology: A system of beliefs and values shaping perceptions of society and power, often used to justify or challenge structures of domination.\n\nDemocracy: A system that seeks to equalize decision-making power. Majoritarian democracy enforces majority rule, risking coercion, while non-majoritarian democracy emphasizes consensus and voluntary association.\n\nAnarchy: A state of society where domination and coercive authority are absent, replaced by voluntary cooperation, mutual aid, and self-organization.\n\nAnarchism: A rejection of domination and the acceptance of mutual reciprocity in all dimensions of life, seeking to create free, egalitarian, and self-managed societies.",

            "body": "this is fun so im gonna jam a bit. i think freedom is an extremely problematic word, and has no chance of finding a meaningful function within a system based on law, as that would be absurd. equality is less problematic, but can only be represented in our systems in relationship to the law. we can (ideally) only be equal to the law, since this is a sphere within society where we use idealized sizes. There is no equality or freedom in societies economic sphere due to its material reality (and since we neither want or need the same recourses or could/should to the same work. its not even conceivable as an ideal). Freedom and equality is thus excluding ideals, and as long as we have legal systems, equality should be demanded there. \n\nFreedom is best explored and reached through the individual, and cannot be 'granted' by a state. I think we can find several meaningful experiences connected to freedom. I will argue that you are free to the degree that you can see the reasons for what you want to do, while simultaneously seeing the result of it. At the same time i will argue that you are free to the degree that you can control your thinking, emotions and will. \n\nThis kind of freedom is an individual journey, and (in my opinion) the only ground anarchism can stand on. Anarchism doesn't have to oppose the system, it cancels it out and can build communities of individuals that are free from the ideologies of politics, and the chains of law. its in my opinion the only valid political ideal, but cannot be the result of a political movement. It lives in the real world, and has to grow and develop to the extent there are individuals able to take charge of their own minds and bodies and communities.",
