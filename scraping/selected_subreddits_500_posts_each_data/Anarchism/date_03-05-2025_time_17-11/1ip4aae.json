    "selftext": "I'm two years out of highschool and studying at a community college. My father has been a blue collar worker his whole life and made it known to me that I'll regret it if I led the life he did in construction, and in the mill. Every since 9th grade, though I was slightly conservative then, I despised the idea of work. Not work in itself, but a life of work, because to me life felt antithetical to it. Now, as I'm receiving an education, I feel more and more despair reading the news and seeing the state of the world. Reading history of stateless and/or horizontal societies don't bring me much hope either. I just want to live in a world where whatever work I do feels important, like it fulfills a purpose, as this one makes it feel almost worthless. \n\nToday I was planning to join a group reading, at a local anarchist collective (unlucky, an ice storm hit), but mostly for finding community. I suppose the point of this post is that I'm feeling anarchism, or any other anti-capitalist movement for that matter, is a lost cause considering how dominant our economic and political structures are. Learning about the world only depresses me more. So, why should I feel anarchism will gain any wider engagement, or at least enough to be effective? After all, if we did we would surely be warred against until we had no capacity to serve ourselves.\n\nI want to be hopeful, maybe, at the very least, I will help a movement persist beyond my own life. As AI progresses, however, it feels as if the rich (who have exclusive control over its use) will dictate the course of history just as before. \n\nI can't tell if I've lost hope because anarchism is really only a buffer on the system, or if I am becoming more depressed learning about it. Does anyone else feel this way?",

                            "body": "Interestingly, what you're describing there about at least doing something, is exactly why I found hope in learning more about anarchism.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, probably since I was 6 or 7, I've had some sense of the world being broken. I'd known about people starving in other parts of the world (although not about people starving in my own wealthy country, because that isn't discussed as much), for instance, and desperately wanted to fix it. I also knew that I couldn't, and that nothing short of a \"divine\" level of power would let me. As I got older, my understanding of all the grief in the world expanded, and while I sought answers to the questions of what the \"right\" solutions would be, I never thought that if I found the right answers I'd be able to implement them.\n\nOf course, the other thing I learned with more experience was that I couldn't find a completely right solution to most of these problems, certainly not in detail and to a level immune from critique.\n\nLearning about anarchism helped me realise that none of that is *my* job. It's *our* job, sure, but importantly I don't have to solve any one of those problems, either intellectually or practically. I just have to do what I can to influence what I have the power to influence, and trust both that others will do the same and that others will see that example and want to join in.\n\nNone of us is smart enough to solve any one of these problems, but I truly do believe that together, we're smart enough to solve all of them. Even if that takes longer than I'd like, it's OK (just not ideal). I don't have to live to see it finished even, because my contribution was only a small and still vital part that can be picked up by someone else.\n\nWhen swallows flock together in murmurations, hundreds or even thousands of birds all fly together in formation. They don't achieve this by all being controlled at once, each bird just monitors the actions of around 6 birds nearest them and reacts accordingly. That's all it takes, continuous collaboration and feedback with their nearest neighbours. I find it a very uplifting model for why anarchism has the potential to change the world.",

It's just hard to see a world where we don't need to rely on those government programs, but the community itself. \n\nNevertheless, I am motivated by that feeling of alienation, but it doesn't fail to continually demotivate me in a paradoxical kind of way. I really think it hits me harder emotionally because my girlfriend lived a life of severe abuse and neglect; she has complex trauma, BPD, and bipolar. Life is hard for her and she tries her hardest to get an education and be content with a future career. I know if she lost the housing program, food stamps, and support from DHS and other things it would essentially be over for her prospects. Even then those programs and bureaucrats actively work against her while trying to help her and I want something different.",

All empires have one thing in common: they fall.\n\n> So, why should I feel anarchism will gain any wider engagement, or at least enough to be effective?\n\nIf anything, anarchist principles are natural. How will this world we inhabit look as the power structure contradicts itself into self immolation? People will have to, by necessity, act in anarchist ways. Look to the histories of and current war torn corners of the world and how populations navigate literal genocide and dispossession. How does it happen? How do people resist or survive? Is it worth it? It\u2019s worth it to them. Why?\n\n> As Al progresses, however, it feels as if the rich (who have exclusive control over its use) will dictate the course of history just as before.\n\nInsert any aspect of technological advancement into this statement to replace AI and see how this is a question as old as the printing press, gun powder, the wheel. Consolidation of power has always been the common denominator, and resistance to it crafts turns in history. Yeah we are in a technofascist hellscape, so how do we resist? They want your grief and depression and sense of disempowered capitulation (or resigning), don\u2019t let them have it so easily.\n\n> I can\u2019t tell if l\u2019ve lost hope because anarchism is really only a buffer on the system, or if I am becoming more depressed learning about it.\n\nThere has never and will never be a turnkey solution for permanent liberation for all. Dialectic thinking is your friend. This world is horrifying, and this world is beautiful - beautiful enough to make a relative case of the horror we experience and perceive. \n\nAlso your 20\u2019s are potentially one of the most intense mental periods to navigate as you gain both more consciousness and experience navigating the world. Depression and grief are natural but need your attention to resolve them from stunting your own life. I didn\u2019t want to not kms everyday until about 27ish, and it\u2019s still a constant struggle. Maybe that internal struggle can be thought of as a microcosm for the world. How do we help ourselves through grief and depression? How do we help the world? Anarchism as a framework is really helpful in thinking and acting on these questions in my opinion",

Together, you could do amazing things. At the very least, you could make some good friends to share ideas with. With the right people, maybe you could build something with a wider impact.",

It was something about doing the work anyway, even if it feels bleak, because it means we still have agency amongst ourselves. \n\nIt makes sense to be overwhelmed by the chaos of the world, but I think that's also what works in our favor. Things aren't as well controlled as they seem. I can tell you, working in a bullshit corporate job, you can see just how disorganized the operation is from the inside. But why is this a good thing? Interest convergence!\n\nInterest convergence happens when two unlikely groups suddenly have a similar goal. Take the civil rights movement. In the 1960's, the US was losing the Cold War with the USSR, both domestically and abroad. How could they be the freest country in the world while bombing children in Vietnam and upholding racial segregation at home? Their initial reaction was to surpress these movements, but because people protested, held sit-ins, actions, they made the problem unavoidable, which caused tension on the international scene. At that point, the US government and civil rights activists interests converged: grant civil rights, bask in the image of freedom.\n\nIt's not perfect and it's fucked up when you realize the powers that be will never care about the common good, that they will always think of how it benefits them, but idk, for me it's made it easier to negotiate. Utopian optimism clouds judgement, you know? It's best to keep you and your community's interests first. \n\nAnd to be honest, I've learned a lot of this by doing very unsexy work with my neighborhood housing union. So I think you were in the right direction trying to go to that meeting today. In the chaotic world we live in, you never know what'll happen or who you'll meet. Maybe you'll have a little co-op with people you love, or work hard for a season and fuck off the rest of the year. You never know. \n\nKeep your head up OP <3 !!",

            "body": "I would suggest you look over the Transcender Manifesto, Deep Adaptation and Syntropic Agriculture. I think it's pretty hard to drive motivation from a negative, such as \"no government\". \n\nIn Syntropic Agriculture, for the first time, I saw a real situation where humans can be good for the natural environment, rather than restrict themselves to harm reduction. In a view that living beings are optimally driven by internal pleasure, unconditional love and harmony. And we're living beings after all, you don't need to be a martyr. Transcender Manifesto generalizes it, arguing for the increase of the carrying capacity of the biosphere as a goal. \n\nSo now, we have a positive direction to go and how to go about it. It just so happen that existing governments, with full control of the violence apparatus, are in no position to do much, if they are to survive at all. So we need to create resilient alternatives, that can't be captured by corporations or the state. We can derive the arguments of why authority would undermine these pursuits, why we should localize production and create community, and so on. So in practice we're back to anarchism, but through more positive definition that can define clear avenues for action.\n\nDeep Adaption goes on essentially how to still be driven to action under the general assumption that civilization as we know it will collapse. And in a way it gives anarchism a win of sorts, and poses new questions. The government/corporate structures will probably collapse, good for you, can you make sure you and the people around you can survive, and maybe even thrive, through that fall? Can we keep some sort of a global, diverse, complex system? What can we preserve from all the structures, the knowledge, and everything we built so far?\n\nAnd most important, you'll see that you're not alone. Whether it's economic systems, productive practices, social structures, political theory, free software, there is so much good work being done that you can't help but be inspried. And you'll see that not having wider engagement is great. We're iterating, building things, seeing how they fit together, creating a coherent alternatives that actually work across all these different domains. When they see it it's too late.",

So then we ask ourselves, how do I want to allow my views to shape the world I live in. Best case scenario: I magically stumble upon some land and try to develop an anarchist intentional community that can thrive and be a microcosm of the dream. Worst case scenario (if I stick with it): work in social services and try to serve and love the people around you, teaching them new perspectives through being the example. It's what I do now, and it ain't the best, but it's pretty fucking awesome. During the 2020 protests, young radicals would come to my place to decompress, and I was able to offer them space, love, and guidance as they through themselves at riot squads night after night.\n\nOur dream may never come, but never let the best become the enemy of good.
