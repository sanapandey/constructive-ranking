I am an autistic addict in recovery, and friends and therapists keep telling me to \u201cfocus on healing\u201d. But we are running out of time.  I cannot heal when I keep getting stepped on. This country is an increasingly violent nightmare. Even the leftists I talk to are increasingly overwhelming to be around. The same sentiments, expressed thousands of different ways. Over and over. It hurts. I don\u2019t even read theory properly.  All this privilege and no wick left to burn already. I feel all I can do is face the gun. Who am I doing this for, when I call myself an anarchist? Is this performance for all of you, too? \nWhat is the alternative? Is there an alternative?\n\nHelp me understand what I have to do. \nThere are no answers, are there? ",

Please don\u2019t use living here as an excuse to become complacent. If you do move please pay attention to local politics, support indigenous resistance, rally against the exploitative TFW system that is essentially built to exploit foreign workers and subject them to unsafe work environments. Also most of us are literally boycotting everything right now and very realistically preparing for an invasion, we are taking every threat to our sovereignty seriously. There\u2019s lots organizing by labour groups and communist groups here, used to be more anarchist spaces but they are dwindling.",

People are dying and losing jobs and access to needed support. Is this happening in your life currently? Or do you know when it\u2019s going to start? Or are you afraid it\u2019s coming/have ideas about what those threats are? \n\nMaybe you are already feeling the impact of the new administration. In real life. But I have noticed some folks in my circle are really worried, but the impact has not actually hit their life on the ground yet. \n\nIm concerned that people are exhausting themselves with worry before the fight even arrives in their life. They\u2019re \u2018shadow boxing\u2019 with ideas until they\u2019re spent, instead of pacing themselves so they\u2019re ready when their turn to actually throw down arrives. I\u2019m trying to pull a team together to plan and prepare, and part of the struggle is getting folks to take their foot off the mental/emotional gas pedal so we can get a solid look at what we\u2019ve got to work with. \n\nYou get to make decisions for yourself, and managing autism and addiction recovery is plenty to do already.",

You are a victim of a lot of things meant to predate on vulnerable people and not give them great alternatives. The biggest changes tou will make won't be on a large worldwide scale, it will be making lasting changes within yourself and people around you. Making a firm foundation, and then those around you will 'infect' others. \n\nBut your focus shouldn't be on helping others right now. You have empathy and remember it, that's amazing.
