            "body": "Some notes for activists:\n\nDon't bring your phone (get a burner if you can; where I live it's kinda annoying).\n\nSimilary don't bring id or credit cards. A small amount of cash can be useful. Where I live most vending machines don't take paper money so I mostly have coins. \n\nWater is good to have on hand. Dehydration sucks and sometimes you just need to wash chemicals out your eyes (just use water for that). In that case one of those sporty squirt bottles are useful. \n\nA foldable umbrella has proven useful. Make sure it's a cheap one because cops *will* destroy these.\n\nA black t-shirt can easily become facecovering. It's also nice to change into something not covered in sweat, water, chemicals, &c. If you bring one it's handy to put it in a plastic bag.\n\nSpeaking of: if you're bringing a backpack just push a couple of empty trashbags into it. They don't take up much space and have a variety of uses. Toilet paper is similarly low weight and multipurpose. Takes up a bit more space. \n\nIf you have space left over in your bag and are ok with the weight having extra water or (vegan) snacks to share is cool. If you're bringing stuff to hand out: stickers and menstrual products are nice. Cigarettes are a good way to make friends (I don't smoke myself).\n\nSomething I also like to bring is a few ends of rope. I cut them into manageable lengths beforehand so I can leave my knife (or knives) at home. This has been useful multiple times but once my shoelaces broke and the rope was a lifesaver.\n\nEar protection is another thing people often forget. I've accepted my hearing is fucked but I still bring (cheap) plugs to hand out to others.\n\nDon't forget to bring gear you can actually use (with the exception of a first-aid kit which is useful even if you can't use it yourself). **Know** what's in your bag and roughly where it is. Practice walking around in your protest gear and with your protest bag so you know it's comfortable enough. \n\n**Most importantly**: Adapt to the possible risks. There's protests where having a phone is gonna be acceptable or even useful. There's protests where I don't mind carrying a foldable knife or multitool. Sometimes I'll bring a foldable flagpole and a flag. I've been to protests where the biggest risk was getting trapped by the police for a while and getting bored. So I brought a book and some playing cards.\n\nThink about this in advance and discuss with your buddies and affinity groups. You can also discuss who's gonna bring what. Not everyone needs to bring (say) a flag or some spray paint.",

If there's instigators, point them out as they might be undercover cops.\n\nKeep a civil rights lawyer's number written on your arm in case you are arrested. Also know the face of the lawyer in case the cops pretend to be your lawyer.",
