    "selftext": "So I have a coworker/friend I'm looking to deradicalize. Due to the nature of our work relationship, I'd rather avoid punching/shaming/disassociating with him since he'd likely be unaffected and/or confirm his 4chan views. He's recently shared with me some views of his that are antisemitic and some that are ethnonationalist or at the very least ethnonationalist adjacent.\n\nThese are some resources I'm using to prep in approach. If any one has any video essays or research to help prep material wise, it'd be greatly appreciated.\n\nI'll post a list of videos which I'm using to prep my approach in the comments. Analysis/critique of my sources would be appreciated but not my main request.\n\nEdit: Further clarification - He's esposed \n1. Conspiracy theories about Jews controlling media, politics, and \"Global Finance\"\n2. Fence sitting about \"13% of the population, 50% of the crimes\"\n3. Free speech absolutism (and explicitly defending hate speech)\n4. Articulated that Japan is betfer than the US because of cultural homogeneity\n\nHe's a frequent user of 4Chan and so I suspect he's got more beliefs adjacent to ethnonationalism, antisemitism, capitalism, and more. Real Alt-Right type stuff. I'm not really very deep in the debunking of these subjects as I listen more to MLs, demsocs, ancoms, libsocs talk about case studies of economic theory than specifically debunking ethnonationalist and anti-semitic views.",

Having other friends they like helps, getting them away from whoever radicalized them or whatever connections to the far right world helps too. My experience was best served not engaging with them unless they came to me with honest, good faith questions about who I am and what I believed. I would answer their questions and explain my thought process. Otherwise I would often entertain their statements as if it were a bad joke. The goal of when they sprout their inane garbage is to offend you. Make clear how ignorant they sound and you steal the power away from those beliefs. Sometimes this process involved light ribbing, other times (usually when someone was directly hurt by what they said) this process involved direct confrontations.\n\nNone of this works unless you\u2019re someone they respect and like.\n\nIt could be months, it could be years, and no one is and should be under the obligation to do it. I think it\u2019s remarkably good for someone to want to deradicalize someone. It\u2019s a lot of work and putting up with bullshit in the meantime.",

            "body": "Seeing some ok answers in here, but I don\u2019t see a ton of functional advice, and I want to point something out that I think didn\u2019t get touched on:\n\nIt is good to want to deradicalize people, but I think it\u2019s important to not let that mission take priority over protecting people around that person. You want to be very intentional about how you spend time with this person and how you show up when it comes to holding them accountable for things they say around other people.\n\nThat \u201cholding them accountable\u201d piece is important-you can\u2019t let stuff slide just because you are trying to maintain a friendship with them to \u201cderadicalize them\u201d because that just becomes a situation where you get to have an easy relationship with them while you are enabling them running around, saying fucked up shit to/about other people. \u201cTreating people like a human being\u201d does not mean \u201clet them say and do whatever they want\u201d\n\n(I also know a few too many folks whose entire social circle is \u201cpeople they are trying to deradicalize\u201d and instead it becomes them just wanting to hang out with folks they feel morally superior to, where nobody calls them on their own shitty beliefs\u2026but then they call it activism)\n\nThe secret is definitely avoiding arguing about their political beliefs directly (they want that), and making it more about how they show up in the day to day. I\u2019ve had success being blunt with people-ie \u201cYou should probably be careful saying that out loud, because if you hurt people\u2019s feelings, it\u2019s going to cause a bunch of drama\u201d. The intent vs impact convo is helpful too-\u201cI know you\u2019re not talking about this person individually or intending to hurt their feelings, but it\u2019s going to hurt their feelings when you say something like that regardless\u201d.\n\nYou want to maintain the type of relationship with this person where you can have good boundaries with them and hold them accountable, but you don\u2019t spend a lot of time arguing about political stuff. That doesn\u2019t mean never disagree, but it means disagreeing in ways that focus on the goal-getting them to be socially normal/functional enough to bring out in public.\n\nI say this as someone who helped deradicalize a good handful of people, and one of my best (and most radical) lefty friends is someone I met when they were in college prepping to be a cop.\n\nAt first, it\u2019s going to take a lot of one on one time to figure out the core problems behind their beliefs and check some of the more fucked up stuff that comes out of their mouth. I recommend finding ways to do this in less public spaces. You want to be careful to not just make this about allowing them to become codependent on you or building some kind of unhealthy relationship that\u2019s about performing how well you get along despite your differing beliefs. Be empathetic but don\u2019t turn this into a savior complex-they\u2019re a person, not a project for your ego.\n\nAs you spend time with them, you will naturally figure out what the root issues are that are leading to them feeling the need to be combative and contrarian, and you can start working on that from an emotional standpoint with them as well as just encouraging them to develop interests and hobbies outside of performing being a contrarian asshole.\n\nIf you can get people to stop constantly spewing combative bullshit, and start being able to show up in social situations normally, that\u2019s the first step. And then you can start taking them into spaces where they are exposed to more different types of people and ideas. Encourage hobbies and low-stakes social activities. From there, you\u2019re out of the danger zone and it just takes a little bit of nurturing and good boundaries to avoid backsliding. \n\nThe last big thing to remember is that you can\u2019t be so emotionally attached to successfully deradicalizing them that you are incapable of recognizing if/when you need to walk away/someone maybe isn\u2019t capable of being pulled back.\n\nDoes that make sense? Sorry it\u2019s a little messy-I just woke up.",

Just a friendly reminder that phrases like \"terminally online\" and \"touch grass\" are ableist and help to perpetuate the harmful idea that one's value and contribution to anarchism and anarchist praxis is centered solely on \"meatspace\" interactions. We recognize that in-person organizing is important, and we encourage it, but our disabled comrades are valuable, as are their contributions regardless of their ability to go outside.\n\nWe highly recommend [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=iGFSJ3gv1kY) ([watch on Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=iGFSJ3gv1kY)) for further explanation. \n\nThis may also be a great time for you to take a moment to review our [Anti-Oppression Policy](https://reddit.com/r/anarchism/wiki/aop) to see how and why we try create and maintain a safe space for marginalized people to hang out without seeing mirrors of their oppression and language used to degrade them based on their marginalized identities.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
