Don't get me wrong, pardoning the J6ers is objectively bad, but its primarily bad because of the broader fascism crisis in the US. Like, what difference does it makes if a thousand Brownshirts get pardoned when you've already made the fucking fuhrer chancellor?",

Surely it goes without saying that we all are for abolishing the so-called \"criminal justice\" system and the state as a whole; we are all hanging out on an anarchism subreddit, after all.\n\nThat being said, I think the article, while clearly not of an anarchist persuasion, nevertheless makes some interesting points. I certainly imagine some constraints on executive powers on this issue (and in general!) are in order, as well as the acknowledgement that even the best presidential pardons do virtually nothing at all to address and correct systemic injustices. Those two points shouldn't be controversial, and it seems to be at the heart of the argument. Some quotes I thought were pretty interesting:\n\n\"It\u2019s worth questioning the principle that the president should get to override the entire legal system at their own discretion. In a country that was ostensibly founded in a rebellion against monarchy, the right of one executive to single-handedly decide the punishment or reprieve of individuals\u2014overriding sometimes years of due process with the stroke of a pen\u2014feels more in line with royal prerogative than anything we\u2019d associate with an enlightened republic.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s understandable why someone who believes that prisons are inherently unjust and violent institutions might support the idea of the pardon, since it ultimately reduces the number of people who are in prison. But it does nothing to reform the injustices of the prison system itself. The goal should not be to simply let everyone out of jail, but to introduce alternative forms of accountability that are more rehabilitative. Pardons don\u2019t do this. The people who receive them get out of jail free, while the people who don\u2019t remain in a system that is still just as unfair as it was before.\"\n\n\"At the very least, rules should be put in place to prevent the flagrant self-dealing that the current pardon system allows. Presidents should not be allowed to pardon members of their family or their political associates. It should be a power reserved to help ordinary people in cases where the justice system has wronged them, not as a magic 'Get Out of Jail Free' card dispenser for the president\u2019s best friends.\"\n\nObviously, I don't think anyone here agrees with the implication that *anyone* should be imprisoned, but I certainly didn't read this piece as the full-throated defense of the prison system that some are suggesting it is. If *anyone* deserves to be imprisoned, surely it's cops and brownshirts and fascists, no? As long as we're stuck with a government, it seems fair to criticize the fact that the supreme fascist (ie the president, whoever they may be) has the ability to unilaterally do whatever the fuck they want.",

First is the obvious anarchist objection to a \"reform\" entirely dedicated to making it more difficult to free political prisoners.\n\nSecond, to focus on that sort of administrative reform *when fascists are in charge* is a major failure of priorities. And since the reform only makes sense when fascists are in charge, it seems pretty pointless (except as a long-term way for liberals to make it more difficult to free political prisoners whenever they regain power per my first objection).",

(Obviously, I'm in complete agreement with your first point, as well as the first part of your second point, that a \"focus on that sort of administrative reform when fascists are in charge is a major failure of priorities.\")\n\n\nIdeally, since I *have* to live in a nation-state, I feel (perhaps naively, I admit) that I want the institutions to be \"robust\" enough (ie have enough guardrails, checks and balances and so on) that they throw up roadblocks and pour sand in the gears for when inevitably, fascists get in and do fascist things. Intuitively, I don't want there to be single political positions that have outsized power, although I do see the point about this outsized power being more \"efficient\" in releasing some prisoners than if the pardon system were changed to be determined, say, by committee.\n\n\nBut I totally see your point, and it's certainly for me to consider; thank you. At the end of the day, though, if we both agree that the prison system ought to be completely abolished it's not really a very fruitful discussion; you may very well be absolutely correct, I acknowledge that I don't know.
