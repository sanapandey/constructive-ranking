Please know I had to have this conversation with myself, I don't know your ability and I don't mean a offense, don't make another victim, if you are not mentally and physically training yourself/healthy enough not to be a liability in that environment, don't go. using a bunch of resources on going over and getting yourself killed in front of a bunch of people who have already lost too much is no favor. There are things you can do that are just as critical as fighting on a front, training as a medic is a good idea either way. \nI feel you, I was gutted that my chronic illness made me too much of a liability to volunteer for Ukraine, you're not crazy for wanting to do something, anything, even if it feels futile, but be calculating, the work that has gone into you surviving until this moment is not without worth, stay dangerous, a better world is possible with you in it. Your frustration isn't crazy",
