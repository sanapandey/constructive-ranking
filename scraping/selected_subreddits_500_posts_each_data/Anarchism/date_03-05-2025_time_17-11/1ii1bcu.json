(Especially with no communications device) \n\nDiscuss with your partner comfort levels. \n\nEstablish a safe word or way to express you are no longer willing to go further or advance further into hostilities. Another for that you need to leave.\n\nPhones may be jammed or connected stingray (a police device that pretends to be a cell tower and takes your information)\n\nWrite a phone number in sharpie on your arm. You will need to make phone calls if detained. Do not write someone's numbers who might also be detained or might wish to remain unknown as a connection.\n\nWhen you receive a call from jail, the person answering will hear that someone is calling from the jail and will be given your legal name. Make sure the person answering will be someone who would answer a call like this. You will not be allowed to leave a message.\n\nMake sure you have plenty of food. \n\nYou may find yourself \"taking cover\" for several hours at a time. Sometimes up to a day or two. If things go well you have snacks for the walk back. If things go poorly you'll be safe. \n\nDo not drive alone. Assume you might be followed or even pursued. Some people have access to license plate databases. Assume if someone sees you they might be able to view the registration. Automated license plate readers can be in the area. \n\nThe same is true with facial recognition cameras, not less accessible to police officers bored spouses.\n\nCarry cash and a photocopy of your ID. No cards. \n\nIf you cannot prove your identity you may be held until they verify your identification.\n\nA change of clothes can be helpful. Bring able to change your appearance quickly can help get away from people pursuing you. These events usually have vigilantes and looking different while fleeing or returning to your transportation can be helpful.\n\nKnow your exits and be situationally aware. If things get too risky, know how you're leaving\n\nI'm honestly more afraid of vigilantism these days. A lot of this isn't directed at fears of the police (which is scary) but fascist gangs. I have seen my legal name and associates, and license plates and addresses on their databases and you'd be a missing something to think they're uneducated and unorganized",

It may not be for you.\n\nMy assumption is if I'm having a police interaction, they're already detaining me. They're not just doing the thing where they ask for an ID and just have it right back.\n\nMake sure to understand how to justify why you brought a copy. Being defensive when asked or saying the wrong thing can be suspicious or incriminating. You're carrying it because you're worried about losing it. Never suggest to s cop that you're intending to hide your identity.\n\nA photocopy has all the same info on it and should be a good enough way to show who you are. Everything is digital these days and they should be able to quickly verify. \n\n Now, in a situation where you didn't want to be identified, a copy is easier to destroy. Again, I'm more concerned about \"vigilantes\" who might harass you.\n\nIt's also something low risk where replacing an ID can be troublesome.\n\nI've never actually needed to use a photocopy for it's intended purpose, but I've lost so much shit at these things and been so concerned about privacy that I feel okay doing it.",
