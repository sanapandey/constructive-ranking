    "selftext": "\"TL;DR: I need formal education and credentials to survive and eventually reform/overthrow the system, but I deeply oppose its reductionist, oppressive, and anti-neurodivergent approach. I want libertarian education that embraces doubt, critical thinking, and diverse ways of knowing. Currently trapped between institutional survival and my anarchist epistemology, looking for perspectives on navigating this contradiction without losing myself in the process.\"\n\nI've been doing exhausting research and reading several posts about education in this subreddit.\n\nI'm new here and I'm mainly looking for like-minded people, who are so rare to meet in Italy.\n\nI've always been an unorthodox student. I live in Italy, I'm autistic and gifted, and I live with a chronic disabling condition. I have no family. My autistic condition has made me particularly devoted to science, and over the years my reflections and way of thinking have naturally drawn me closer to anarchist thought, particularly its ecological and communitarian current. Perhaps I'm more anarchist than I realize!\n\nThroughout my life journey, I have experienced systematic discrimination and abuse, istitutional too: at university, in high school, and in the communities where I lived as a minor. My unconventional way of thinking, giftedness, political practices, and specific needs related to my atypicality were certainly catalyzing elements of these experiences of marginalization and violence. These continuous social pressure and discrimination have led me to develop deep depression.\n\nI consider anarchism as a possible foundation for an ethical epistemological paradigm that aspires to overcome fragmented, reductionist knowledge. My passion for study and reading, which I experience as acts of subversion, has progressively distanced me from contemporary institutions. In ten years of professional experience across public, private, cooperatives, and NGOs, I have observed how neoliberal ideology and kyriarchy have corrupted ideals, principles, and projects at every level, especially in Italy.\n\nCurrently, I do a job I love - I dedicate myself, besides obsessive studying, to advocacy and support for young people who grew up without families - but it's economically undervalued. I live in poverty. In our country, which I deeply love for its language, food, climate, and geography, working conditions for neurodivergent and disabled people are extremely problematic. I also strongly oppose English as a lingua franca (I'm sorry for native-english), both for socio-political reasons and due to my neurodivergent needs. Therefore, leaving Italy is not the most immediate option for me.\n\nI've enrolled in university to continue my studies, but I'm increasingly convinced that mass education pursues objectives far from learning quality and the development of critical thinking and autonomy - fundamental elements for forming individuals capable of contributing to their own, their community and nature's well-being. The degree appears increasingly necessary, but the meritocratic competition for scholarships, combined with the self-referential nature of the Italian system, requires conforming one's cognitive processes to a pathological system and assimilating beliefs that don't belong to me. The elimination of doubt in institutions, evidently considered subversive, is another significant issue.\n\nMy purpose is to conduct research in the sociology of institutionalized knowledge and in epistemic justic to overturn my country's educational system. I strongly believe that the way to an anti-oppressive and equitable society parts of education. However, to gain acknowledgment, credentials, and economic support (just enough to survive, haha), I must follow the institutional path.\n\nHow can I overcome this impasse?",

            "body": "Your post is very verbose, and I'm far from being an academic Anarchist, so forgive me if  I'm missing something, but, from your post, it seems like you already found the answer to your problem. You said these academic credentials are needed for the eventual reformation of the system, so you could just view it as a means to an end.\n\nYou already have ingrained Anarchistic beliefs, and you've maintained them even through school, so I don't think any single institution is going to force you to conform to it's own belief system. They are \"anti-Anarchist\", obviously, meaning they won't always uphold values like equality and equity. They are only going to care about what makes them the most money, but you already knew that, so maybe you can look at it as a prime motivator to reach your goal rather than a concrete roadblock.\n\nUnfortunately, I think as long as you refuse to conform to institutional and societal expectations, there is no real way to avoid the sorts of discrimination you mentioned. And I don't think leaving Italy will help all that much, but I could be wrong. \n\nSimply, I think just continuing your way of thinking, educating yourself and others, and viewing school as a means to an end, is the only real way you can bypass your current predicament.\n\nIf you disagree though, please let me know, I'd love to hear what you think.",

Anarchists just argue that we don't need a state to enforce these values, we can do it ourselves\n\nAs for your second point, a person more qualified than I could probably provide a better answer, but, basically, since Anarchists believe we can achieve order and stability without traditional government, it's seen more as just a system to dominate the people, and keep those in power powerful and wealthy. \n\nThat's an ultra simplified version of it, but I'm still educating myself more in Anarchism as an ideology as well.",

That's an absurdly large goal.\n\nWhat you should do is focus on making your own academic practice more accessible and work at reducing barriers in how you communicate with others and give information. I'm taking my PhD currently in the UK as an interdisciplinary scholar in arts and it's all about doubt, critical thinking and 'postionality' -essentially how do you see things. \n\nMy work is also subversive, but to get to that point I first had to learn the background of research and methods of working within academia. \n\nYou don't overcome this impasse - you get degrees if you want to add to research around education and add to the critical literature surrounding it. \n\nAlso, ASD and 'gifted' is common in academia, especially the further up you go. I'd advise critically analysing your attachment to the social roles conferred by these categorisations and whether or not they will be much help later down the line - coming from an autistic person.",

                    "body": "This issue is far less banal than it might appear. This text, while it might seem verbose, condenses years of heretical study and reflection into a radical critique of educational systems - indeed, this path of critical inquiry is what led me to anarchism. I used to be a top student, even achieving good rankings in regional Mathematics and Chemistry Olympics, but then something started to crumble. I am still pathologically hungry for knowledge and thruth.\n\nMass education has always been a classist enterprise, designed to perpetuate social inequalities. The Bologna Process (3+2 structure) has further reduced the possibility of critical thinking in universities - I'm speaking about Italy, but I suspect this is similar across Europe.\n\nThe fundamental issue is systemic: knowledge has been objectified and reduced to a Cartesian approach, stripped of its inherently political nature. You need transdisciplinary approach, not interdisciplinary. Universities have lost their role as spaces for political reflection and critical discourse. The evaluation logic applied to both professors and students reinforces this depoliticization, reducing complex learning processes to quantifiable metrics.\n\nThis framework manifests in teaching: most professors lack pedagogical competencies (both didactic and mathetic), and their increasing precariousness further compromises educational quality. Classes are lecture-based rather than Socratic, with professors positioning themselves as epistemic authorities rather than guides. Even if a student wanted to approach knowledge critically, the time constraints make it impossible. One cannot thoroughly read sources, compare them, question them, and engage in meaningful discourse with peers and professors.\n\nThe problems extend deeper into the system's structure. In Italy, academic feudalism and favoritism among close colleagues is pervasive. Research funding mechanisms and the growing presence of intelligence agencies in universities further compromise academic independence. While I deeply value science as a social enterprise that requires trust, sociology of science shows us that knowledge commodification and information overproduction are causing both scientific research and trust among scientists to collapse. Due to neoliberal 'publish or perish' logic and quantitative evaluation of papers, approximately 2 million documents are published yearly, with estimates suggesting only 7-8% are 'scientifically valid' (based on rigorous scientific methods). The reproducibility crisis, especially in softer sciences, can no longer be ignored. We've reached a point where reviewers can't reliably distinguish between AI-generated and human-written papers.\n\nThe consequences are severe: contrary to popular belief, higher education doesn't necessarily attract more gifted and neurodiverse individuals. There's a high dropout rate among these groups, primarily due to lack of critical and inclusive pedagogy, toxic competitiveness, and insufficient focus on ethics and scientific rigor. I don't believe science can exist without ethics and societal engagement.\n\nHave you heard of the epistemological privilege of ignorance and epistemic injustice?\n\nBourdieu's analysis of 'Homo Academicus' reveals how the academic system reproduces itself through its own hierarchies and power relations. He demonstrates how academics, while often studying power structures in society, are blind to their own participation in these very structures. The university system doesn't just perpetuate social inequalities - it creates its own form of social and cultural capital, with specific rules of legitimation and exclusion. What's particularly insidious is how this system presents itself as meritocratic while actually reinforcing existing power structures. It's becoming clear that we can't just change the rules of the game - we need to change the game itself. This is, fundamentally, a war of paradigms.\n\nI don't need reassurance, incrementalism, or comfort - I need to find and build radical alternatives together with others. In Europe, I've found only two truly alternative educational experiences: the Vrije University and Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles.\n\nI apologize for not citing sources for my claims. Since my argument aims to be evidence-based, I'm happy to provide the relevant papers to support each statement if anyone is interested.",
