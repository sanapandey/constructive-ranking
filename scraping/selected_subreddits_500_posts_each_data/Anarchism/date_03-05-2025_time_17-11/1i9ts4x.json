I wish I wasn't living in a colony but it's not like I can just leave.\n\nI want to do the right thing but a. I barely have the energy to take care of myself. b. I don't know what I should be doing anyway.\n\nI feel like an outsider in the place I was born and I don't know what to do about it.\n\nWhat's something that I can do that is within my means?\n\nJeeze I'm sorry if this is a bit of a ramble\n\nTLDR: How can I call some place home when it shouldn't be my home in the first place and was stolen from someone else.\n\nUpdate: I'm sorry if I caused any arguments, I have a tendency to internalize things more than I should.\n\nAlso I was probably a bit too emotional when I posted this, I apologize",

Our collective obligation, and I say that with strong emphasis and encouragement to understand why it\u2019s incredibly important to see this as not only things which happen in our own colonized states, but in the world at large, (re: the very parallel Palestinian Genocide) Start focusing on moving forward with the knowledge of trauma, and keeping indigenous communities autonomous, dignified, and protected with the colonial privilege you have. Don\u2019t speak for them, but advocate with them in solidarity. \n\nSeek out groups which aim to break down systemic barriers indigenous populations face. Promote initiatives that fight for their voices to be heard and know every day where you\u2019ve had an upper hand. I think this is one of the aspects to privilege that people often overlook. \n\nKnowing your social geography and how it benefits you and not others is an exercise in reconciliation. \n\nApplying this to indigenous pops and learning about their generational trauma and being compassionate to those who\u2019ve experienced institutionalized barriers like the carceral system, police, healthcare (ei: birth alerts, a beyond horrifying history with reproductive sterilization, forced medical trials), criminal justice, and very importantly -childcare- (residential schools, the 60s scoop, the list is endless, and while the two former are known Canadian based atrocities, we\u2019re both a crown corp and likely have shared trends due to that fucking family may THEY ALL REST IN PISS). \n\nDemanding justice for the hundreds of thousands of modern missing or murdered indigenous women and girls is something that is still rampantly ignored here in Canada. \n\nSupporting radical actions like Landback in ways you\u2019re comfortable and still recognizing your role here is important. Again, speak with, not for. \n\nOur countries are different geographically\u2014they\u2019re not even comparable, but our governments and many of the people around us share culpability in actions taken against this community. Do what you can to promote and uphold the dignity and preservation of what colonization and oppression have taken from this rich culture. Hoping that\u2019s helpful. \u2764\ufe0f",

We must focus on the present and future, history is for analysis and applying said analysis to craft a better future. How can we correct the wrongs of the present day? How can we prepare for future horrors and avoid repeated history? These are far more useful and progressive contemplations to have on the matter. Beating yourself up over it won\u2019t help, and actually sometimes it can come off as a bit racist if you are too overflowing with guilt about these things.

Grounding them in a practical and actionable everyday solidarity.\n\nTo further develop this decolonial approach with anarchisim, I recommend reading the\u00a0EZLN critique of anarchisim.\n\n\u00a0https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ejercito-zapatista-de-liberacion-nacional-a-zapatista-response-to-the-ezln-is-not-anarchist",

You have a poor understanding of this shit which is why you say \"colonial past\" as if colonialism isn't still ongoing and being resisted.\n\n\"Indigeneity is almost always a reactionary construct that should be regarded with suspicion. We are all from somewhere else and we should all have the right to live wherever we want.\"\n\nThat's literally the point. Indigenous is a label created by an oppressed group who are denied the right to live on their land, usually on an ethnic basis. Indigenous movements are about deconstructing the colonial framework that inevitably forms these ethnic hierarchies.\n\nWhite people using anarchism as a crutch to ignore any systems of domination they might benefit from. It's not enlightened. You cannot frame everything as a \"state versus everyone\" situation, while undermining other power dynamics and claiming you offer the purest form of anarchism.\n\nThis is why people get tired of white anarchists because they love, love, love, to act like they are so high and above everything because they are \"enlightened anarchists who have dismantled all hierarchy, unlike those ignorant MLs\" and then go unto ignore genuine material oppression, just like this.\n\n\"Being born in a country with a colonial past doesn't make you a 'colonizer'. It doesn't mean anything. It's \\[REDACTED WORD INDICATING LOW INTELLIGENCE\\] and divisive and you aren't doing anything productive by doing a 'land declaration' before you speak at an activist meeting. It's the most pointless performative shit imaginable.\"\n\nJust want to focus on the \"it doesn't mean anything\" point. \"Yeah bro there are NO material implications to the conditions that created you bro, just trust me.\" You shouldn't think about history and why the things the way they are and how it may be related to any contemporary modes of oppression? Seriously?\n\nAnd colonial entities do not see land in the same as the indigenous not because of some blood and soil bs, but that by nature colonial entities view the land in an explicitly extractive sense, as something to be conquered. The colonial identity is one which largely asserts a hegemonic notion of land ownership, which indigenous people are many times forced to abide by. Colonialism creates or largely exaggerates the frameworks you say you are against. \n\nThis is the white anarchist version of \"not white power, not black power, but worker power\" bs",
