There's gotta be a lot of good stuff out there already if you know where to find it, so let's make it easy to find, for people to be able to choose what to print from a wide selection of quality materials.\n\nHow it works: post them in the comments. Also post if you have further thoughts on how to organize this collection, or suggestions of other collections that should be (or are already) started. And crosspost or share this post to other venues too, like resource lists of 'Things You Can Do.'",
