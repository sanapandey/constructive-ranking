    "selftext": "If I'm not mistaken, FNB core beliefs and principles revolve around \"food is a right, not a privilege\", food recovery, consensus, nonviolence, and the serving of vegan or vegetarian foods. Very rarely do I see FNB groups serve chickens or porkchops, as from what i gathered, FNB fights against the abusive meat industry. If my assumption is true, why they fuck would someone want to serve meat? Not even as food recovery but a whole ass meal of chicken, pig and cow. I heard that Gainsville FNB, at least from what i gathered, is one of the only FNB chapters that serves meat. Doesn't this directly go against what FNB is? Serving vegan or vegetarian food is a protest against war and poverty, so I am so confused on other people wanting to disregard that belief. \n\nFor the record, I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I respect this organization, and as a FNB member who wants to continue these beliefs, I'm fighting people who want to bend them (mind you, these people are not anarchists). \n\nAm I missing something? I feel as though I am going insane.\n\nEdit: to add, originally, if there were any meals that had meat in them, we would donate them to soup kutchens or other non-vegan foodshares nearby. We would not throw out the food. ",

The local FNB I know uses meat when it is donated to them and will make sure it is clearly marked if the dish contains meat but they never purchase meat. From what I understand Food Not Bombs does not have a centralized/national organizing and each \u201cchapter\u201d is a local group organizing.",

If not that some people just dumpster dive.\n\nSo keeping that in mind sometimes the chapters get meat products. While the group tries to uphold vegan or vegetarian principles when it comes to making and sharing the food it doesn't necessarily absolutely deny local chapters from using any animal products or the very least it can't prevent it from happening \n\nPut it like this, if you get donated meat or meat products that would otherwise go to waste and your main job is to feed people for free will you not take that meat and cook it rather than try to hold some higher moral ground by not serving meat to people that have no problem eating it?\nRegardless of what your personal beliefs are or what the group stands for of course some people will utilize whatever they have to do good and to help others even if that means going outside the general guidelines as they don't see it to be that big of a deal.",

We always had vegan/vegetarian options available and never bought meat but sometimes we would get large donations of meat from restaurants, caterers , and grocery stores and throwing it out would be way more destructive environmentally than offering it to people who wanted it. Just because I don't personally eat rotisserie chicken doesn't mean the 6 we got donated should be thrown in the trash, when there are people starving.\n\nMost of the people who come to Food Not Bombs are not vegetarian, and frankly most Food Not Bombs struggle to accommodate the demand, so making use of meat that would end up in the trash anyways makes a lot of sense to me.",

Is it to make a statement against factory farming and the current food production industry or to provide mutual aid to our fellow individuals? Honestly, it's a pretty liberal action to disregard donated food, and additionally the relative value of directly purchased food items, that doesn't conform to your morals. Keeping factory farmed meat to a minimum is definitely a good thing, but the emphasis should thoroughly be on providing nutritious food to those who are hungry. The fact is, in most areas, it is cheaper to build a balanced diet when you are including meat. You obviously need vegan and halal/kosher meals as well, but in order to provide aid to as many as possible we really should be including meat to some degree. Means and ends need to align to produce the result you want, sure, but at a certain point you are engaging in lifestylism by entirely disregarding an action or product that is only immoral due to its context within a capitalist, hierarchical society. You can make the claim that meat consumption is inherently immoral, but I would argue that the vast majority of people don't hold that view and that we quite frankly have more important issues than quibbling over using meat that would be produced by factory farming regardless of whether we specifically consume it. In other words, there is no ethical production under capitalism, so we must use our resources as effectively as possible.",
