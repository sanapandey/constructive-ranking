So here are some Wikipedia articles that I think are really good which discuss the history of anarchism in many other countries.\n\n* [Anarchism in Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Argentina)\n* [Anarchism in Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Brazil)\n* [Anarchism in Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Chile)\n* [Anarchism in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_China)\n* [Anarchism in Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Cuba)\n* [Anarchism in Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Indonesia)\n* [Anarchism in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Japan)\n* [Anarchism in Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Korea)\n* [Anarchism in the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_the_Netherlands)\n* [Anarchism in Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Peru)\n* [Anarchism in the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_the_Philippines)\n* [Anarchism in Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Poland)\n* [Anarchism in Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Puerto_Rico)\n* [Anarchism in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Syria)\n\nPlease, share any thoughts in the comments!",
