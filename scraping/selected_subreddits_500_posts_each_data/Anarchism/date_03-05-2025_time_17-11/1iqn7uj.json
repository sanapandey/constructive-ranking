We go from port to port, bartering, recruiting, and generally improving people's lives all over the world. We build more ships. We build a bottom-up organized network that allows us to build specialized ships for manufacturing and recycling. On land there will always be a landlord, so we take to the sea and never bow to anyone again.",

But there\u2019s a lot to discuss.\n\nI\u2019m talking fist-sized polyhedrons with threading. Plus metal rods, around 2 meters long. Flat semicircular flotation devices. Steel grids with fiberglass and epoxy, handcrafted into the hull. Self-sufficient tech. Wastewater treatment with methane gas production. Waste becomes raw material. Cleaning the oceans is self-sustaining. Massive ship structures\u2014totally pre-revolutionary.\n\nMy biggest hurdle is open-sea wave action. My solution? Protected bays with minimal wave action. Coastlines like Croatia\u2019s. I\u2019ve got blueprints, construction plans, mainly energy-related calculations: entropy, energy generation, insulation, heat pumps, temperature differentials, compressed air engines, even up to the Linde process for using liquid air as energy storage.\n\nI\u2019m dying laughing\u2014people have forgotten how to dream. I\u2019ll double down and say hydrogen tech all the way to cargo zeppelins. A world-saving solution you can DIY from the hardware store. Plus a homestead as compensation for the effort. A solution for many type of crisis.\n\nI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re all on about\u2014the kid\u2019s right.",

Let's work on that.",

                            "body": "Thanks for the private message. I also feel an urgent need to share my synaptic nonsense with a larger group for discussion. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s right not to found some know-it-all secret society, but to openly debate everything. Many have written that they\u2019re \u201cin.\u201d In\u00a0*what*? Critics and supporters alike should be able to contribute their two cents constructively. Is this just enough for a solarpunk novel and three crazy readers drowning in the Mediterranean, or could a viable idea actually grow from it?\n\nDue to the language barrier, I try to condense texts extremely\u2014even in their native language, they\u2019re barely readable. And I\u2019m bad at writing, sorry if it seems chaotic. For example: Big ships are expensive\u2014just maintaining them costs a fortune. Plus, that would require a very densely packed lifestyle, like living in a loud high-rise without windows. Nobody wants that. But it might make sense for systemic processes that need density, like hospitals, factories, administration, military, or police. I\u2019d rather see this as a grassroots movement.\n\nIn the Western world, we have major issues with proletarianization through land ownership. Even our coasts are privately held. We\u2019d struggle to build floating pods or secure test sites for money. But we do have easier access to science and tech. I bet half the chat has boxes full of cables and a handful of Raspberry Pis. We should barter with threshold countries where the opposite is true.\n\nI also want to discuss the term \u201csolarpunk.\u201d To implement autonomous tech, we need the complete toolkit of science and technology. Solar alone is too lame\u2014it\u2019d just become cyberpunk. That\u2019s why I prefer \u201cnomad-punk.\u201d My focus is on land acquisition, existence rights tied to forced labor, and Darwinian evasion into harsher habitats to escape competitive pressure. With autonomous tech, a return to the mainland could be possible anytime. Homes become mobile. Like with a caravan, anyone could retreat. The decentralized, hands-on aspect is essential\u2014we\u2019re viewing everything from a Western ivory tower. None of this should be patentable.\n\nWater favors two things: mobile and reconstructible, communities\u2014expandable, divisible, adaptable infrastructure\u2014and better utility networks you can modify anytime. Maybe you\u2019d need a diving tank. But where do we want to go? A beautiful life with gardens, courtyards, and garages for all. By the water. In the sun. We work where our kids play. Our wife calls out that she has to head to the center because of a work trip and will bring dinner home. Or\u2026 stinking, rumbling diesel barges, no daylight, no perspective, no way to share ideas in a larger discussion.\n\nI\u2019m a generalist focused on chemical engineering. We need social sciences\u2014how do we define communal life? How do we raise kids? We need politics\u2014how are majority decisions made? How are solidarity systems organized? \u201cSolidarity\u201d as in workers supporting each other, the healthy helping the sick. In a nomadic lifestyle, workers leave the house in the morning, while care work\u2014childcare, elderly care, social care\u2014stays with the caregivers. I want to tackle exclusion and design systems that enforce inclusion. Maybe create a rite of passage: \u201cDaughter! You\u2019re 18 now! Go to the sea with the others. May you find yourself, lay the foundations for your future, and hopefully return with a pod full of in-laws and grandchildren\u2026 or cats.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t need allies, crowdfunding, or a movement. Just some framework, fiberglass, epoxy resin. What I\u00a0*really*\u00a0need are neighbors. The sea is rough\u2014you can\u2019t conquer it alone.",
