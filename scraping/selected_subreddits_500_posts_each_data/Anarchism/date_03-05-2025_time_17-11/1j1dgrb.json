            "body": "I don't want to take away from your frustration or justified anger. But there's at least 2 things at play: one is this being a commercial platform. While mods have a lot of say, they don't have the final say. A lot of mods try to moderate in a way that allows for as much freedom for the users as possible while keeping the sub off radar and not getting shut down by the actual owner/board of directors. Plotting the state's demise in a non-jokey way would probably do that.\n\n\nAnother is normalcy bias. Even when we know logically that things are headed to shit and awful things are happening right now, if it's been more than a few days and I'm not bleeding out, the brain seeks out an equilibrium where everything is fine actually. It was a false alarm, the tigers are not chasing me. We have all the time in the world. We don't have to do anything actually, because everything is normal. Normalcy bias is the dog in the burning house meme.\nTo get passed that, you'd have to keep reminding yourself actively that the house is on fire, and many people are not experienced in doing that.",

I used the term normies which could be seen as pretty negative, but in general I do have a lot of compassion for peope, because when I look at my life and experiences I see a lot of small things that pushed me into who I am now and how i see the world, and when I interact with other people I have to take into account that their lives are wildly different than mine with a lot of different small things that got them to who they are. and basically, I think if I'm striving for a world without oppressive heirarchies I have to try to be an example and just work with people regardless.

I was raised believing in leftist values, but in a more, well I guess liberal way. In the sense of like yes, police violence is problem and black people are more targeted by far than anyone else, but there are some good apples in the police force kind of a thing. You probably know what I'm talking about. So, when I first encountered things like ACAB, or full on communism or anarchism, I wasn't really sure that I truly believed in them. It wasn't until someone had a talk with me as to what ACAB really means (that it doesn't matter if a cop is trying to \"do good,\" they still are adhering to and supporting an unjust power dynamic and system) and it wasn't until I was able to meet leftists with feet on the ground, actually doing good in their community with actual, functioning mutual aid networks, that I could really see why these ideals and ideas are important and why they're the most likely way forward if we want the best for humanity. I didn't think any of this would work, but I actually now see how it could totally and fairly easily work with only a few minor adjustments in most people current way of life. Really, the only major adjustment is for the billionaires and people who lord over others with an iron fist because they legally (for now) are allowed to. But if weren't for those leftists who saw that I had the spirit and that my heart was in the right place, but that I was missing some pieces to the puzzle, I'm not sure I would've gone as radical left as I have. Now I do community organizing and helping all the time. And it's fun! :D",

If someone points out that Trump is worse for Palestine because he suggested ethnic cleansing (a suggestion that he has not actually followed through with) feel free to remind them that Biden/Harris weren't *suggesting* it, they were actively doing it. When asked if she, as president, would put any pressure on the Zionist Entity to end the genocide, such as arms restrictions, she unequivocally said no. No stop to the arms, we just need a ceasefire. I don't think much of her, but I don't think she's remotely ignorant enough to fail to understand that providing unlimited, unconditional weapons to the people who have been territorial aggressors for 80 years and are now committing genocide is traveling in the opposite direction of a ceasefire.\n\nMatthew Satan Miller often said that the US was working on a ceasefire, but that we were unwilling to pressure the Zionists into a \"unilateral ceasefire\". My man... The aggression is unilateral. The violence is nearly unilateral. A ceasefire in this case can only be unilateral. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThe word \"complicit\" does not adequately describe the level of guilt that Biden and Harris have for the genocide. It is exceptionally obvious that Biden (lifetime racist extremist in America) harbors the same annihilationist racism towards Palestinians that is typical of Zionism. I don't think that Harris is quite as racially driven. I think she's more of a Western Chauvinist, and that's where her deep-seated support for Western Imperialist, expansionist genocide stems from.\n\nOh yeah, and to add on. Not just the weapons and the funding. Don't forget the unlimited political support. The Zionist Entity would've necessarily been curbed after their 1967 war of aggression (to at least some degree), except for the unconditional, unwavering support and vetoes of the US. That was true again for the last year and a half. Literally every aspect of the genocide is directly and explicitly empowered by the US.\n\nEdited: changed a word from the Ableist Glossary to a suggested alternative.",

The majority of people with the ability to change things (the vote eligible citizens of the colonizing countries, who aren't so racist/sexist/anti-lgbtq to never change), have only been feeling the negative effects of their being exploited slowly increase for the last few decades.\n\nThat slow ramping up of freedoms being stripped away and their exploitation being increased, is about to get a lot faster; we're only in the beginning. It will become more obvious, especially as the American economy is going to go to hell, and as the *ignorant billionaires enact their extremely *silly cyberpunk 2077 ideas, that's all gonna make a lot of people who were once too attached to their comforts more desperate and aware.\n\nNow their desperation will be taken advantage of by political movements looking for blood to power the machine, and it will work like it always does because desperate people are, well, desperate, and asking them to figure out everything while their communities crumble is a bit much. Now ideally this is where activism should come in and save as many of these lost desperate souls from their sorry misinformed fate as possible.\n\nI'm confident (based off my complete lack of expertise) anarchist sentiment will grow, and that for all the internet's faults it will allow ideas that were once constantly smushed under the boot of *<gestures everywhere>* to gain real lasting momentum. I suppose it will allow many ideas to gain momentum, I just believe anarchism is the right one that makes the most sense and is the most compassionate, and humanity prefers this when it is not desperate, or traumatized, or otherwise distracted from what I believe is our essential nature.",

That definition does not explain what petite bourgeoisie actually are.\n\nTo start with middle class, that is just an arbitrary term capitalists came up with to essentially muddy the waters and keep people unaware of the actual, material differences of their condition vs. that of the bourgeois. Nothing concrete defines the middle class, it's all relative. I suppose you could call myself middle class, but my version of middle class is obviously far removed and significantly degraded from my parent's version of middle class, for example. I just happen to sit squarely in the middle of average/median income.\n\nPetite bourgeois, however, is defined by concrete relations to the means of production. What makes them petite is that they are generally small enterprises where the owner has to take on a secondary role and do some actual work, but they do still steal the value of the workers they employ. They just aren't *total* parasites.\n\nI think in Marx' time, this concept would've been a lot more readily apparent, but the waters are incredibly murky now that everybody and their mom and their mom's dog is invested in the stock market in some way. Either way, that's what the poster above you was getting at. Middle class literally means nothing, because the limits are arbitrarily set and relative to some nebulous average, but they tell you nothing about how a person relates to the means of production, whether they must sell their labor or not, it doesn't even really tell you how they live their life compared to middle classes of the past.\n\nUnrelated to that wall of text, it's also completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand anyways. It's really just about American propaganda, not that the libs are \"middle class and have a vested interest in the system\". I mean yeah, some of them do, but you'll get plenty of people who aren't that invested still acting this way because they've been told their whole lives that literally anything that isn't capitalism is evil and/or doesn't work \"in practice\".",

None of them stand up for Palestine or Palestinians because of multiple reasons:\n\n\u2022 colonialism/colonization - they don't understand or believe it is a thing of the past\n\n\u2022 fascism - they misunderstand it & don't see Israel as the fascist ethnostate that it is\n\n\u2022 racism & xenophobia - they DO see that Palestine is being colonized, but Palestinians are considered a lesser population because whiteness (i.e. Ukrainians) overrules Brown (/Muslim - although not all are) suffering & death\n\n\u2022 eurocentrism - they believe that because Ukraine meets the criteria of statehood by international law (which is often critiqued as influenced by Western values) that somehow Palestine isn't a legitimate country even though it existed long before Isnotreal\n\n\u2022 imperialism & capitalism - they see the colonization of Palestine as a means to imperialize other Peoples & Their Land and exploit their resources by Israel (our ally) & the US while Ukraine is a victim of Russian imperialism (Russia being our enemy)\n\nAll of these ideologies fold into white supremacy as a whole, which we know is hierarchical in nature. Challenging white supremacist thinking can be extremely difficult to do because a lot of people have been brainwashed into believing that this is how it is and how it will always be. Especially those who never thought to examine it. Plus, they are surrounded by others who believe the same.\n\nIf we look at the murder of Thompson and the alleged suspect, Mangione, many people do see how they're exploited by the ruling class but do not engage with it consistently.\n\nI think unless those kinds of events happen many times over and are displayed on mainstream media (most people still watch it), it isn't there to be actively engaged with.\n\nAlso, so you all know I'm an Indigenous person so my perspective may be a bit different than some of yours on here. A lot of us Indigenous folks believe and know there is possibility of a more equitable world because many of our communities already are and have been for centuries.",

Are they recruiting members hand over fist out there? \n\nActually wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if they were\u2026having your country get invaded has a way of energizing all kinds of (ultra)nationalists, revanchists, irredentists, all kinds of people like that\n\nI really have no real dog in this fight lol, you show me evidence that there\u2019s actually a real, viable far-right movement in Ukraine that has REAL POWER, and is not just a bunch of boneheads seig hieling in the streets as they get ready to get their asses blown the fuck off on a Ukrainian battlefield somewhere (ie exactly what the Russian federation has been utilizing their own neo-nazi boneheads and dregs of society for), then I\u2019m ready to say, yknow what, some new shit has come to light man and I\u2019m worried about this Ukrainian nazi dirtbags.\n\nBut\u2026you look at electoral results for groups like Svoboda in 2019\u2026and it wasn\u2019t just them, they were in a coalition with like half a dozen other nationalist organizations\u2026they took around 2% of the vote and they captured one seat in the Ukrainian parliament, ONE!\n\nFor a point of contrast, in 2012 the same party captured several million votes (over 10% of the total) and gained 37 seats in Verkhovna Rada. \n\nBut really, from my own perspective, it seems like an element in Ukrainian society that is marginal at best is often trotted out in an attempt to discredit or taint the war effort against Russia. \n\nDuring the European sovereign debt crisis, the situation in Greece devolved into a total basket case around 2010-2012. At some point during that debacle, a formerly very marginal political party composed of neo-nazi boneheads called \u201cGolden Dawn\u201d grew their movement until they were coming in third in parliamentary elections. Their political program was like straight up, real-deal nazi shit\u2026but they also opposed the IMF. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been fair for all the activists who were waging a struggle on behalf of their people and against the IMF to be constantly be compared to those shitbirds, just as it\u2019s very unfair to the average Ukrainian soldier to constantly get compared to Ukrainian nazi shitbirds. I get why people do it tho, propaganda purposes and it allows you to hate or mistrust one side much easier if they\u2019re associated with Nazis or fascists.\n\nAnd, to be clear (and it should go without saying really, considering the sub we\u2019re on), there are plenty of reasons to oppose this horrible conflict. Two capitalist states bleeding each out, neighbors killing neighbors, soldiers slaughtering people who are just like them in SO MANY WAYS, even down to the blood flowing through their veins.

But the biggest cultures of our world, the most influential and populated, aren't very aware and/or continue to be actively manipulated and reinforced by bad yes, but I believe mostly ignorant actors.\n\nIf you aren't informed you will lean more on your culture's thoughts, and if you aren't sufficiently emotionally intelligent/independent you will lean on your culture's feelings.\n\nMost people's hearts are in the right place, but to them I imagine criticizing Ukraine is synonymous with supporting Russia, who is obviously worse and actively invading Ukraine. Now that's not the case, but again they are limited by their circumstances and cultures, and unless there is incentive to change they will continue to justify their circumstances/ideas/feelings.\n\nBasically they aren't immediately capable of the nuance required to understand your position, and though they can learn (it's not intelligence that really stops most of us) it would mean rejecting confirmation bias and attachments they already have, so they're more likely to default to what the simple-thinking of the culture is, and see you as a Russian apologist.\n\nAnd this is something all of humanity struggles with so I personally would not be hard on them, because it would necessitate being hard on myself and I don't feel that it's productive to ridicule people for acting as their circumstances dictate. Plus if you are ignorant siding with the bigger culture is the smart move generally speaking, there's a reason humanity is by in large not so rebellious as to upset their entire culture, and that's because for almost all of human history upsetting everyone is a terrible time for the one doing the upsetting, and too much rebellion undermines the culture entirely, which make no mistake is a setback.\n\nNow these days undermining a culture is considered ideal, because there's so many that we all kind of feel that it's quicker for a culture to fail and fall apart then supplant it with our own awesome anarchist one than to try and fix it. But that's our perspective, people willfully participating in a culture want it to work, and if it needs to change then to do so safely, with caution.\n\nBasically you're using your voice to try and make the cultures more nuanced and ultimately correct in your understanding, whereas general population feel their cultures are mostly good, and you're not trying to help, you're trying to undermine, and there are bigger (in their understanding) problems, like Russia obviously doing evil colonialism shit against Ukraine.\n\nSo if you want to criticize a culture (rightfully) for lacking nuance and deeper understanding of what's happening, you must do it like you would a person, by making it clear that you seek to enlighten people from a place of good will, not to try and undermine their beliefs and supplant them with your own because you have criticisms. Now a lot of people will still reject your ideas regardless, because there're so many factors involved I don't even know, but it is by far the most effective way to help people see your perspective. A lot of smart people have a problem with this because they may know a lot about the world but lack a good intuition for dealing with people, and ironically fall into the same traps because although they are smart and likely more independent, they are not close to being as intelligent or free-thinking/feeling as they think they are.",

In many ways different form many concepts that were central for nazism.\n\n>Citizenship is not equal to nationality or ethnicity.\n\nOf course is not. But I find strange to blame Ukraine for what was doing Bandera only because he happened to share ethnicity with majority of citizens of Ukraine.\n\nAnd last thought: I believe that \"cult of Bandera\" in modern Ukraine is in part thanks to Soviet propaganda: They called any resistance to their rule of Ukraine as conspiracy of \"banderites\", so in many ways they boosted Bandera standing into eyes of average Ukrainian and helped to connect him mentally with fighting of independent Ukraine.",
