    "selftext": "Hi, I've been a FNB member for more than half a year now, and I really love the organization. However, recently, there has been essentially a take over from DSA to the point where I discovered that they were serving non-vegan food for multiple shares. I was unaware of this and we swiftly shut that shit down once we discovered it, however I noticed not only was there WAY more DSA members in FNB, and those specific members watered down and undermined the point that an OG FNB member made regarding the core values of FNB. I'm not sure what to do about this nor who to turn to about this. All of this has been very weird and very frustrating. \n\nUpdate: All these comments are very helpful and I appreciate them all. Shits still going on and I'll update more when I get the chance. ",

As someone who isnt vegan and has participated in (what i would call) ethical farming like raising chickens, i also had some questions about practicality. But anarchism is about self-determination and freedom, so making vegan meals is a really universal way to make sure hungry people can eat.",
