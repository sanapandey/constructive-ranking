I'm my country, you can get 3 liters of detergent for 2 bucks and a few cents if you're looking for the cheapest brand. The cheapest brand here may not have the prettiest color or the prettiest bottle, but it does its job well. \n\nTo save detergent, and make it last longer, there are a few simple tricks: \n\n* Use a small amount for each wash. The recommended amount for each wash, according to the market, is one capful per wash. If the detergent is good, use half a bottle cap per wash. Most likely you won't notice any change.\n* Maybe this advice sounds very clich\u00e9, but in times of need all advice is welcome. Accumulate a large amount of clothes to wash, that way, you'll save water and liquid detergent. It doesn't matter if you wash clothes of different colors, unless, for example, all your clothes are black and there is only one white garment. \n* Also, use a little less water, if your washing machine allows you to lower the water level or something similar. With less water, the little liquid detergent you use won't be diluted as easily and can be effective.",

In my country, US is seen as the land of opportunities, and even as an example to follow. Not gonna lie, many people in my country think the majority of americans are rich (big houses, expensive cars, fridge overflowing with food, etc.). \n\nWhen I saw the price increase, especially in food and medicines, I thought: \"Oh well maybe that's expensive for me but for sure americans receive very high salaries\". A couple weeks ago I found out the minimun wage per year in the US is approximately 15.080 dollars; and, doing the math, it isn't enough for average people, considering how much the cost of living has risen.\n\nThe minimun wage per year in my country is approximately 6.120 dollars, but things are way cheaper here. How come inhalers for asthmatics cost over 500 dollars? In my country both public and private services give them for free to anyone with the disease! And even if you decided to buy them, on average you would spend 2 or 5 dollars. Maybe 10, if you go for the more exclusive and expensive ones. In my country, a person only needs to spend 70 bucks per month to buy all the essencial, basic food; I've seen Americans spending $30 a week for food that isn't even enough to be healthy! \n\nI really wish americans stand up as soon as possible for their rights, it's really a living hell right now for the average american :\\[ <3",

If I remember well, the federal minimum wage in America is 7.25 USD per hour, right? How many hours per day an American has to work to survive? :C\n\n\nIn my country, minimum wage is 510 bucks per month. Tipping works differently here. You aren't required to tip people who work in tipping areas. The employer is obliged to pay the employee at least 510 bucks per month for their work, so no, people in my country don't live on tips.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, in restaurants, when you ask for the bill, they give it to you including the total cost of everything you ordered, and the total cost of everything you ordered plus tips to the waiters. You can decide whether to pay the bill with tips included, or just pay for what you ordered. The waiters' tip is approximately 20% of what you ordered, that's how is calculated in my country. At the end of the day, or month, the waiters divide the tips they earned equally.",

A country in South America! :\\] \n\nWe have a little bit of inflation here, but the cost of basic food (fortunately) has lowered to 68 or 69 bucks. \n\nIn recent years, the minimum wage has increased. Previously, the minimum that an employer had to give their employee was approximately $459, which wasn't enough for several middle and lower class families, taking into account inflation. Almost 10 years ago, free universities came into effect. To apply for this benefit, you must be part of the most vulnerable 60% of the population, have taken the university entrance exams, and have had high grades during the last 4 years of school. Higher education in Chile used to be incredibly expensive and was only accessible to a few. It was quite common that young people were accepted to universities, but were forced to turn down the offer due to lack of resources, or to go into debt for years. \n\nThere are several excessive costs in my country, for example, clean water. The cost of water in Chile is ridiculously expensive when you consider that water is purified through literally the cheapest and simplest method in the world, the same goes for the electricity bill. Add to this the problem of insecurity, especially in Santiago, the capital of my country. However, I think that Chile has made progress in several social and economic issues.",

Fascism came into being in the aftermath of WW1 and the great depression when people had nothing It is only natural for people to look to a strong leader that promises them everything in times like that.\n\nToday, we live in a time with unequaled riches, knowledge, and as close to post scarcity as the world has ever seen.. so the .01% have jacked the prices up on everything from food, to housing, to education, and even water to make us more poor and at each others throats. All in an effort to bring the riches that fascism grants them.\n\nI told my parents 40 years ago that they wanted to bring about neo-feudalism, and they laughed at me, my mother recently told me that I was right. Thankfully my father didn't live long enough to see this, nor my grandparents who fought against fascism the first time.",

And unlike a lot of DIY projects - the up-front investment pays itself off instantly and only takes about 5 minutes to make. \n\nIt costs about $15 for supplies but creates the equivalent of $100-$200 worth of liquid detergent. It also cleans better than liquid detergent, in my opinion, and i work in construction + garden so my clothes get very heavily soiled. Here\u2019s the recipe: \n\nIngredients\n\u2022 1 cup Washing Soda\n\u2022 1 cup Borax\n\u2022 1 cup Laundry Bar Soap (grate with a cheese grater)\n\u2022 A container for storage\n\nInstructions\n\u2022 Combine all ingredients in container\n\u2022 Use approx. 1-3 tablespoons per load",
