Now, not decentralisation into *anything*, but distributing a problem means more efficient information flows (which helps).\n\nTwo, anarchism places much more of a focus on how individual actors can apply costs to those wishing to dominate others. Having that space of shared values and levels of commitment/capacity to self-sacrifice, to carry out actions of potentially globe spanning impact means that we can more easily get some shit done (but this is limited re:levels of commitment, value-alignment)\n\nThird, the inputs and problems facing a complex system change over time. Hierarchical and rigid structures are *much* less able to deal with change, which inclines them toward some balancing act between loosening the reins of power, and maintaining the continuity of their rule. But this is costly.\n\nFourth, our values; domination *inherently* has to control and stifle creativity or deep-thinking, because that adds to the unpredictability (and predicitability is necessary for control). Anti-domination values and social infrastrucure leads to a greater abundance of creativity.\n\nFinally, we can also look toward game theory, and the ideas that collective action to solving collective problems can arise as an organic dominant strategy between agents without external enforcement: [https://archive.org/details/eo\\_The\\_Possibility\\_of\\_Cooperation\\_-\\_Michael\\_Taylor](https://archive.org/details/eo_The_Possibility_of_Cooperation_-_Michael_Taylor)\n\nThese are all just pointing toward a general answer, than flat-out providing a \"solution to the collective action problem\", because, as I said, it's a, it's a strong argument, in that the problem exists and it's a hard one. I will point to to an essay that goes a bit more in-depth: [https://wedontagree.net/collective-action-problems-are-not-a-capitalist-plot](https://wedontagree.net/collective-action-problems-are-not-a-capitalist-plot)\n\nWhat we can know with near certainty is that we will forced *by necessity* to look for radical alternatives to the way we manage society by now, simply because the problems that soceity is facing are increasingly too complex for centralized government: [https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile)\n\nAlso a good read: 'Don\u2019t Let Reality Catch You Slippin\u2019 [https://c4ss.org/content/51729](https://c4ss.org/content/51729)",

            "body": "For me, one of the more recent ones that's arisen, is the realization that many anarchist collective decision making processes take a lot of time, and people have limited capacity. Sometimes it's more convenient just to delegate authority over this or that issue- for example, watershed management and other issues of managing the commons which benefit from the input and advising of experts. Of course, as anarchists, we actually value expertise and the \"authority of the boot maker\", and we have substantial examples (Ostrom's work documents much of this) of bottom-up management of the commons. But there remain questions on how this should work, given the limits in capacity each person has and the sometimes demanding nature of non-hierarchical processes.   \n  \nNow, that's not something that I think \"disproves\" anarchism by any means, but delegating decision making is a difficult topic- and the question of how to prevent a bureaucratic class from emerging among those to whom decisions are delegated is a serious one. My ongoing struggles with this and other issues, informed as much by my organizing as by study, keep me straddling a line between anarchism proper, and libertarian socialism more broadly defined. In practical, day to day organizing, though, that distinction is not particularly meaningful.\n\nI do think that decision-making processes, and ways of managing collective action problems, are a \"social technology\", and our society has always invested in the social technology of hierarchy and found ways to refine that tool, including by democratizing it and making it more responsive to popular discontent while maintaining the core classed structure. We need to develop the social technologies of non-hierarchical, horizontal human relationships. Our new models will provide challenges, just as hierarchy does and has.",

                            "body": "Not that I'm aware of. I came up with the term, the way I use it at least, some years ago when in the middle of a mass wave of struggle with a rapidly expanding anarchist network that was stumbling through growing pains and trying to sort out how to organize this or that function- essentially, we were trying to develop new social technologies and then generalize that knowledge (what we referred to as democratizing the knowledge) among our peers. Our idea was that all of us had been raised with one, hierarchical modeling of action, and we were developing nonhierarchical ones, but autonomy and nonhierarchy were not just a natural state of affairs- they had to be learned, and taught, and developed and refined in practice in response to the struggles around us.\n\nMore recently, I've been reflecting on the different environments that anarchists in the west and anarchists in Russia experience, and the different forms of government we've historically had, I've been thinking about bourgeois democracy and the \"rule of law\" as a particular sort of social technology developed by the western ruling class to manage their collective rule, which offers it a wider range of tools for maintaining their class rule and stability, than forms which rely more on repression and the centralization of power within one ruler or small faction over the rest of the upper class. So, that has led me to think increasingly about the various specific types of counter-insurgency tactics used by my own government as social technologies, and wondering how they were developed and what other tools and conditions need to be in place for them to succeed.\n\nFor example, in my city, Minneapolis, a common ruling class tactic to discredit militant uprisings by black youth is \"crackerjacketing\", or describing the violence as being done by \"white anarchists\" and \"white supremacists\" (an intention conflation on their part) in order to both deny that black folk are actually that pissed off, and to manufacture the consent by a white, liberal majority of the population to move in and suppress the (majority black) demonstrations and rebellions with brutal force. Respectable white liberals would never knowingly consent to sending the MPD in to gas and beat crowds of bereaved and enraged black youth and young adults, but if you can tell them that it's to SAVE the black community from white supremacists/anarchists, then the liberals will cheer as the cops and National Guard are sent in, clubs and guns in hand. It's a narrative that allows them to resolve the cognitive dissonance of wanting to be good liberals and support BLM, but also actively brutalizing black protestors. But it's not just a tactic one or two people do- it's a consistent, repeated thing that ruling class figures in Minneapolis, and the media, and the cops, and the nonprofit industrial complex, all do- always portraying militant protestors as \"white anarchists\", to the point that at one point folks had a joke that in Minneapolis, all you had to do to become white was throw a brick. So, this is a learned tool the use of which has been generalized among a section of the ruling class. It works because it's in a specific social context: a mostly white, very liberal city with a huge racial wealth gap and a violent, racist police department that the liberal government has never been willing to bring to heel. It build on a previous social technology that is associated more with the Jim Crow south: The Outside Agitators narrative that says that black folk are content and docile, but that white carpetbaggers and skallawags, and later white Communists and Jews, are stirring up trouble and riling black folk up against whites. Most liberals would recognize that narrative as deeply racist, but fall hook line and sinker for the crackerjacketing tactic.\n\nI'm the co-editor of a new anarchist newspaper, the WildCat, though, so maybe I should just go ahead and write a piece on social technologies. Minneapolis anarchists have come up with a lot of terms, actually- crackerjacketing and social technologies, as I've said, but the anarchist movement here also popularized \"community self defense\" in the mid-2010s, which somewhere along the way dropped the \"self\" and became the widespread \"community defense\" that's all over the discourse now. This term was not commonly used in the left in the 2000s. Another local term is \"hermit crab entryism\", which describes left sects coming into and easily taking over moribund institutions like barely-active union locals with low membership engagement. Our local labor scene is currently having a minor tiff over that term and \"resolutionary socialism\".",

The ones that don't get run over or co-opted by MLs or crushed with military violence. \n\nI'm trying to work out how to deal with these tendencies and how to possibly overcome them and plan for them in the future. \n\nAnarchism itself is totally fine, but within the global context, we are up against some serious shit in my estimation.",

                    "body": "> that anarchy, as a state of society and end goal, is utopian.\n\nI've never agreed with these assertions; in fact, whenever I hear the word \"utopian\" is used in these or similar contexts/discussions, I immediately dismiss them outright.\n\nOne reason isn't mere cynicism perceived, but the difference in interpretations of the word \"utopia\". To me, utopia means \"a place/situation that does not exist\". Often some would add that it's a *good* or *perfect* place that doesn't exist, which is... ok, kind of, but the main gist is just a place that isn't out there. That's it.\n\nProblem is, when I hear \"utopia(n)\", I know for a fact that others who use it, on anarchism or otherwise, with it actually want to say \"a place/situation that doesn't exist, AND ALSO CAN'T POSSIBLY EXIST\". And that addition is what I consider nothing less than utter bullshit.\n\nAnarchists and even most leftists on the whole are generally quite adept at accepting and even openly embracing the challenge of the reality that for a successful and long lasting anarchist community in any context, nothing less than A LOT OF WORK (understatement of a century here) is needed, a truly Herculean effort, both in amount and sheer complexity, that most of humanity today just isn't ready for yet. Not even close. \n\nBut here's the key I am stressing all along: all this does make anarchy extremely hard to achieve and then maintain, but *truly impossible*, or eternally unattainable? NEVER.",

This is why they stopped meeting, they were just hanging out as a friend group in the period I had thought they were moribund. I joined as an outsider, thinking that they were failing to be an effective organisation not succeeding to be a glorified groupchat, and so they responded to me trying to resurrect it - so it could organise to promote our cause and support political struggles - by being deliberately \"unappealing\" to \"newbies\" (their words). They were sick of \"centring everything around appealing to newbies\" in spite not having held a public event in almost 9 months, not having posted on their social media or put up posters in a year, and broadly not having done anything other than organise a book club since its founding.\n\nThis experience has not convinced me against anarchism but it has convinced me against Anarchists and specifically anarchist orgs, especially since this experience has been reinforced by the behaviour of other Anarchists I've dealt with since.",
