It requires magical thinking, the belief that there are incantations, literal spells written in to the documents that outline that relationship that can cause that relationship to change in ones favour (which is a lie, the only magic in the global west that one can summon is one that is encountered when one has unlimited capital).",

For example, the presidential oath of office, Miranda rights, verbal contracts, wedding vows, and so on. With the written word, even more so, as judicial interpretations can and often do hinge on very specific turns of phrase, or even on punctuation.  In Islam, speaking the Shahada (statement of faith) three times legally constitutes a conversion, and traditionally a man saying \"I divorce you\" three times constituted a legal divorce. \n\n It makes sense that people would develop what are essentially superstitions about powerful social rituals that they see performed. It's just cargo cult legalism.",

Ironically, in using their pseudolaw and failing, they demonstrate what really sets the state apart from all other organizations - the ability to use violence on other people. The state has a monopoly on violence.\n\nIf you think about it logically, why would the state create a loophole that people can use in order to opt out of its laws?

I never registered for the selective service. I also paid for undergrad in cash, cheap instate tuition after two years at a Community College. I have lived in my current state for 4yrs and never got a drivers license or state ID. I'm unsure about how legal my current dwelling is.

            "body": "I used to be a USPS letter carrier. I had to collect unpaid postage for a flat that was certified and was being sent to someone on the route I was put on for that day.\n\nWhen I arrived to the house, there were a whole bunch papers citing statutes taped to the windows of the house. There were a stack of priority envelopes in the mailbox to go out. These priority envelopes had no \"postage\" but taped to them were more statutes about postal \"law\" and \"requirements\" and that money was paid to  some UN postage fund.\n\nI don't get paid enough for this shit. I didn't take the outgoing mail, it has no USPS approved postage indicia. And I wasn't going to deal with trying to collect postage from this person, and just my luck I didn't have any of the pink \"sorry we missed you\" slips, they were in the truck, so I scanned the certified \"customer hold\" to stop the clock until I could get back to the truck to fill out the slip.\n\nThe door opens up immediately and she says \"what does 'customer hold' mean? I am here right now.\"\n\nNo sense in explaining why I scanned the envelope that, so I pivoted the conversation to the flat had unpaid postage and I needed to collect $10 and change.\n\nShe begins to tell me she doesn't have to pay postage, the flat has \"postage\". It was some weird cut out with a statute on it and a space where the sender used a red ink finger print on the \"postage\".\n\nI told her that whatever that is is not legitimate postage.\n\n\"Yes it is!\"\n\nAlright ma'am, I'm not here to debate you. I'll bring this back to the station and you can try to convince the manager. I start to walk away.\n\nShe starts following me asking me for my name and what my postal title is.\n\nI told her to have a nice day.\n\nShe starts yelling at me that \"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR! YOU'RE AN AGENT OF THE ROYAL CROWN!!!\u201d\n\nI kept walking to the next house to deliver their mail, the woman's daughter came out and told her to stop and come back into the house.\n\nI returned to the truck, filled out the slip, drove to her house, and at the same time she was in her car getting ready to pull out. I stopped, she motioned for me to go. I'm not falling for that trick, she'll slam her car into my van and blame me.\n\nShe gets out the car and tells me she'll pay.\n\nI get out the van and I tell her $10 and whatever cents in US currency, I do not give change.\n\nShe rummages through her wallet, and then she questions me as to the cost and why would first class cost almost as much as Priority.\n\nI had enough, I scanned the flat and the slip, I gave her the slip and said the address to the post office is on the back to pick up her envelope tomorrow. I drove away.\n\nA few things.\n\nThat flat should've never got to me, it should've been sent back to the sender for no postage as a courtesy. Envelopes dropped into collection boxes with scam postage could technically be treated as trash and an attempt to commit fraud on the Postal Service.\n\nIn talking to other carriers they all have their stories with SovCits and veteran carriers will tell you they cite postal statutes from when USPS was the \"Dept. Of the Post Office\" but was reconfigured into the United States Postal Service in the 1970s. All those statutes are null and void now.\n\nRegardless of my views on legislative government, I am a supporter of the commons. The postal service, fire department and the library are pillars in all our communities and serve the betterment of our society. If we have to be taxed I am supportive of tax dollars paid to pay for those services (*postal service doesn't receive tax dollars, postage funds the service). So finding a work around to not pay postage because you don't like the government, but you want to use the service? Miss me with that shit and use a for profit carrier.",
