It was about the shoddy build quality at the price point and then overstating real world range and this was 2013-now. If I\u2019m paying $100k, I\u2019m expecting an S class by Mercedes not a plasticky interior that feels cheap. Other half is Elon himself, because apparently being the richest man in the world permits you to be a Nazi, a womanizer, transphobe, and a horrible father.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is what you consumer activism against Musk, but my supercar driving friends are selling their daily driver Teslas and buying a new electric from competitors. A lot of it was because they don\u2019t want to be affiliated with Nazis.",

                    "body": "It's not being \"gatekept,\" you're simply never going to see concrete actions being discussed **because activists are keeping themselves safe.**\n\nAnyone doing direct action certainly isn't going to be discussing it on Reddit or anywhere else easily accessible. If anyone IS doing that, they're lying for karma points, dangerously na\u00efve, or a plant - or all of the above. \n\nRight now in the US you can and will get arrested for your words *even when you aren't making a clear threat*. People know to be careful. Posting about actions you're planning or doing is just basically putting a giant neon sign up saying HEY COPS COME OVER HERE, and no one who knows what they're doing is gonna engage. \n\nAnd sure, you can say it's your legal right to do so, but a) \"it's my legal right\" is *not* the same thing as \"it's a good idea,\" and b) you really sure the courts are gonna back you on that \"legal right\" things?\n\nBriana Boston was arrested for saying three words on the phone to an insurance company; there's no threat in the words, nor did the caller make any threat, but because they're the words used by Luigi Mangione, she's being prosecuted for terrorism. (There was a rumor charges were dropped because she was released, but it's *not true*; she's released on bond and under house arrest pending a trial.) \n\nJust saw an article about a guy who posted some random thing on Facebook wishing someone would harm Trump. Again, he didn't say he was going to do anything, but he was generally wishing harm and apparently that's now enough, because he's now been arrested. \n\nAnd hey, maybe eventually the courts will say \"ok, you're right, it's free speech, let 'em go,\" but a) the Supreme Court is in the pocket of oligarchs so they only care about free speech when corporations do it, and b) even if these folks are eventually freed, their lives have been totally disrupted by the arrests and detainment, and they're having to spend money on lawyers and I doubt their job is being held open for them while they're in jail. \n\nSo you're never going to see those posts you want where people discuss direct action, because, generally speaking, those discussions do *not* happen in public forums for some very good reasons.",
