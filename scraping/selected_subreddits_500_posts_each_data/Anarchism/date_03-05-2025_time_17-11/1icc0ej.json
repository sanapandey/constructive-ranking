    "selftext": "Hey there, for a long time, I've held views that align with the anarchist spirit of challenging power structures and removing them wherever possible. At the same time, I've often thought about what the ideal, utopian society would like. Or at least, what a society transitioning to that could look like. I've been paralyzed, because I've seen no path for me, other than as a naysayer, a complainer, a whiner, a critic.\n\nI've read a bit, and done some thinking on my own, and I've basically arrived at the conclusion that human beings are essentially organized into hierarchies and systems that are extremely messed up, with state power (at the national level) being the common enemy hanging over all our heads (as I think anyone on this sub might agree). \n\nI don't believe it's possible to attack the nation-states from the top-down and be \"stateless\" at any point in my my life. And I don't believe in an every-man-for-himself way of life either. I believe that full human potential is unlocked when we work in harmony with the Earth and with each other. Thus, some level of cooperation is necessary.\n\nI've been inspired by reading Bookchin, and by reading about \"sewer socialism\" and now believe that cities and towns may be a good place to start making serious changes to get people more engaged in democracy, in managing the little piece of Earth that we share, in figuring out how to share our limited resources, and so on.\n\nI am considering running for local office and want to bring along a vision for radical change based on some of Bookchin's ideas. I want to make democracy more inclusive. I want to emphasize quality of life over more standard economic indicators that the businessmen who usually sit in my local government champion.  I want our city to put the environment more at the forefront of every choice we make. I want to stop spending so much on police (I believe it should be everyone's long-term goal to abolish police or radically redefine what policing is; who wants to imagine a world where crime will always need to be fought by bullies with guns?)\n\nWhat do folks think of this vision? What are some ideas you have about how to take notions of \"fighting the power\" into local government?",

            "body": "Caveat: I do not have experience working in politics. This is just based on my observations from outside, my general understanding of human behaviour as I've experienced it, and my experience working in a multinational corporation where I think some parallel logic applies.\n\nThe danger in running for office is twofold.\n\nFirstly, it means putting yourself in a position of authority, even if you don't believe in authorities. What I have seen suggests that will affect your beliefs and feelings over time. Human beings are what we do, we need to live what we preach, and you may find that acting as and being treated as a (minor, local) authority makes you feel justified in being one.\n\nSecondly, you will have to compromise. Compromise can be good, great even, when it's mutual and collaborative. However, political compromise tends to be pragmatic, focused on either quid pro quo trades of support or doing what you \"have to\" to win an election. I believe both of these risk eroding your convictions.\n\nYou have gotten the same core message I have, however - that we as individuals can't change the world, but we can start working to change what is near us and by doing so link up with other people who'll work with us to change bigger things. It's up to you to decide if the risk of electoral politics is one you want to take and think you can withstand, but there are alternatives - almost any municipal or mutual aid organisation will be a type of this work, and will put you in touch with more people who share at least some of your concerns.",
