    "selftext": "Just watching the discussion about MLs, Fascists, Liberals and Anarchists blowing up here.... and wondering if we really believe that ideology defines anyone?\n\nNora Bateson, the systems thinker who has a lot of interesting overlap with anarchism, says that whenever we are someone as a member of a category, we no longer see them as a person. We don't really see them. \n\nDeleuze and Guattari said the essence of the State is to put things in boxes and judge them in terms of those boxes. Categories have there place, to be sure, but let's not believe they are reality. Otherwise, we become like George Bush, among others, who declared, 'You're either with us, or against us.'\n\nSo here's a question - do we want to connect with people to address the challenges of our times? Or do we want to keep bumping into the boxes and bars of our own creation that keep us separate from each other, separate from Life? ",

We recognize that in-person organizing is important, and we encourage it, but our disabled comrades are valuable, as are their contributions regardless of their ability to go outside.\n\nWe highly recommend [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=iGFSJ3gv1kY) ([watch on Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=iGFSJ3gv1kY)) for further explanation. \n\nThis may also be a great time for you to take a moment to review our [Anti-Oppression Policy](https://reddit.com/r/anarchism/wiki/aop) to see how and why we try create and maintain a safe space for marginalized people to hang out without seeing mirrors of their oppression and language used to degrade them based on their marginalized identities.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These quotes are pulled from fiction and written within that framework. Just like you can pull a completely different message from The dispossessed for example which is specifically about anarchy, which kind of addresses this topic a bit, but the main character continues to strive for true anarchy, even opposing his fellow anarchists.\n\nI love the quote and it's applicable to a lot of things just not this. You can not oppose authority and it will still exist. There is nothing wrong with finding new ways to achieve our goals but this is just working within the framework of fiction and within context of something that isn't even applicable here. You can both oppose authority and find new ways to achieve our goals by focusing on a different path whatever that may mean.\n\nI agree with you on working together but there is a long history of this and it's not bc anarchists want to work within our own boxes separate from each other.",

It's why I don't consider myself a Leftist. However I know that I'm an Anarchist and I believe in Communism and Socialism, but when I say these terms: Anarchist, Socialist, Communist, all I'm talking about is freedom, I'm talking about true liberation for everyone with no exploitation and hierarchies and a true egalitarian society.\n\nThe reality is that a revolution can't be produced by a signal individual that believes in freedom and an egalitarian society, but rather a collective of individuals that have the same common goal and ideological beliefs. And yes, if we want to make change we have to talk to others that disagree with us and show them a different perspective.",

Few of our victories will be absolute, and they will always be temporary.

We need to play the long game.

We need committees across our organizing efforts to hold us accountable to a bare minimum standard of ethics. I hear folks saying we're in a war; if that's the case, we need to be ready to accept autonomy in warfare is secondary to our conduct and collaboration.

In fact, lying about things that will take more energy to validate than the average person will consider is often times the superior approach, because the person attacked will usually switch into a defensive position that onlookers won't bother with considering, and the attacked person's sense of how they are perceived is the main target here)\n\nIf the infiltrators do this well enough, for long enough, people will start doing it because it has been done to them. Basically, the one-upped person feels that they have been publicly kicked down a rung in an imagined social hierarchy, so they feel the need to reestablish esteem by asserting dominance on someone else.\n\nThen as they copy the infiltrator they create more copies, and the effect amplifies itself. At that point they can bow out and watch from a distance as the movement implodes.\n\nToward the end of the George Floyd protests this strategy was deliberately and methodically employed against Anarchism in the USA, and the effects of this remain strong within the community.\n\nAlso, this seems to be somewhat endemic to human societies in general. It wouldn't work if it didn't piggy back on something biological. It happens on the right and the left, in families and friend groups.\n\nThe way to become immune to purity spirals is to value truth more than how you are esteemed by others. Unfortunately, in my life, I have met very few people who achieve this ideal. It seems that the evolutionary conditions for survival in a Chimp troop favored a very fine attention and adhesion to societal norms.\n\nThe obvious way to spot people who are infected or disingenuous is to assess whether they value truth or status higher, but another really good way is to look for the people whose modus operandi is frequent attempts at publicly humiliating others, especially with pithy superficial attacks.",

I don't know if she intersects exactly, but to me what she is saying and, more importantly, embodying, is anarchy which I like to think of as 'the art of relating freely as equals.' \n\nIt seems to be that her work resonates deeply with the greatest insights of people like Ursula Le Guin, Emma Goldman, Dorothy Day and Gustav Landauer.\n\nSo while many anarchists see a system out there that must be opposed and destroyed, she sees that our embodied human systems are part of larger eco/political/etc systems and the real transformation occurs through both inner work and outer connection. This reminds me of Gustav Landauer who wrote\n\n\"The State is a condition, a certain relationship between human beings, a mode of behaviour; we destroy it by contracting other relationships, by behaving differently toward one another\u2026 We are the State and we shall continue to be the State until we have created the institutions that form a real community.\"\n\nIf you have any further thoughts you feel too share, I'd love to hear then.",

It has really changed the way I think politically, I still have the same values, but Nora and Gregory\u2019s thinking has shown to me how people become entrenched in their views. And that system change takes time.  I think one thing I am still grappling with is the contradiction in myself where I want fast and radical change to our system, but also understanding the implications of fast and radical change that it can cause more hurt and more damage, so how do we find that balance? To me that is where I find it contradicts anarchism a bit, which to me calls for that fast and radical change.",

We often need help to break out of the cages we make for ourselves (what Emma Goldman called inner tyrants).\n\nI'm not sure that anarchism necessarily calls for rapid and radical change, but many anarchists do. This seems to me to be a common trauma response - it hurts, make it stop now! \n\nBut what if we can have more compassion for ourselves - to be with (com) the pain (passion) rather than in (em) the pain (patchy)? From that wider perspective, we can see what changes are actually helpful for the whole. This, in my experience, is the shift from everyday mind to the spiritual heart, from I to we, from ego to eco.\n\nNora is a great example! And there are many in the anarchist tradition, in all traditions. We have guides if we're willing to listen.",
