From 9am to 10pm between hundreds and thousands held down multiple blocks, both sides of the freeway, walked, danced, and advocated for miles. One of the most beautiful and impactful actions I\u2019ve seen in a long time.",

I\u2019m not against stopping traffic or causing gridlock, but it seems to me that these large displays are effectively just a release valve for our rage\u2014they make us feel better at the time but do nothing to stop the machine.  Like, I get that this sends a message of solidarity to immigrants (if they even hear about it since the news is so censored), but other than that what is the purpose, what is the substantial outcome?\n\nI\u2019m thinking of Fanon\u2019s chapter in WotE \u201cOn Violence\u201d talking about all the ways that genuine revolutionary/anti-colonialist energy gets displaced, dissipated, pacified\u2014in a word: wasted\u2014and I can\u2019t help but add marches and protests like this to the list.  Because the aristocracy/oligarchs/fascists (lib and con, dem and rep) do not care.  We saw that in \u201803 with the Iraq War, we\u2019ve seen it over the last year with Gaza/Palestine\u2026. It is no skin off their nose because it does nothing to impact their power/money.  We need to be sooooo much more strategic and focused in our actions/with our rage.  Folks like PalAction and Luigi have had more of an impact than a thousand marches.  Just sayin.",

                    "body": "This gridlock wasn't as big as it could of been, if it were large enough, blocking traffic can be a seriously effective strategy on just literally stopping people from doing things.  It's hard to go to work documenting which immigrants you're gonna capture today when you can't drive to your immigrant-capturing-office.  I think eventually we're going to need to resort to a sort of scorched earth strategy of literally blocking off their avenues.  Fast, ziptied fences and barriers put up at night are a nuisance that's hard to deal with and stop.  If I learned anything in the 2020 protests, it's that police, ICE agents, etc. need to be basically shut out from the ability to do their job to stop, either through stamina or physically stopping them.  It's pretty hard to out-stamina a bunch of teams of ICE agents.\n\nAlso, we need to split our actions between what seems to be mostly disorganized non-divisive (among progressives, authcoms, anarchists... mostly) action like this and more direct intentional action.  Tbh, I don't think most of the people who attended this rally are really that left-leaning.  Definitely a few, but most of them are just disenfranchised and angry liberals who don't really have an interest or passion for praxis.  Maybe you can get a few to volunteer for food not bombs, but that's about it.  We can only rely on reality to sway them to much more, and modern right-wingers already show that reality is only worth so much.  This is their contribution and where they're starting from, and the rest is on us.  I appreciate it for a start of what it could be.",
