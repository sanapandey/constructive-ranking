I might try and apply that to my gender presentation. I'm not formally out or anything at work, but having a couple small parts of my appearance being decidedly unmasculine might be a good way to not get stuck.",

For your own path I did something like that and dressed androgynous (women\u2019s tops and bottoms (only slacks and jeans and one pair of culottes and black denim overalls and black flannel overalls, and women\u2019s sneakers.) I wasn\u2019t wearing a single clothing article that was made for men, but still people thought I was a straight (cis) male and I went with that until I was more comfortable doing more",

The trick is just getting used to risking that low-level awkwardness.\n\nAnarchist Calisthenics for ref:\nhttps://harpers.org/archive/2012/12/anarchist-calisthenics/",
