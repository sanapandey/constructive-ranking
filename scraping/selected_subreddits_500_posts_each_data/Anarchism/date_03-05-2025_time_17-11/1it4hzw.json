    "selftext": "Recently came across this but forget where. Essentially looking for more info on how the US government bullies other countries into buying our debt in exchange for \"protection\" like the mafia uses \"protection\", like \"pay us money so nothing bad happens to you, and by nothing bad, we mean we won't come and break your windows and/or legs\". It's also why the US has so many military bases around the world.",

The origins of that debt crisis go back to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo of the late 1970s. Essentially, what happened was that with the spike in oil prices OPEC countries were suddenly awash in so much money that Western banks (in which they invested it) soon ran out of anyone willing to borrow it. The result was a period of \u201cgo-go banking,\u201d with bank representatives jet-setting about the world aggres- sively trying to convince Third World leaders to accept high-interest loans based on wild projections of the economic bonanzas that would follow. A large amount of this money was simply stolen; much of the rest was invested in ill-conceived grandiose projects (such as the enormous dams the World Bank became so famous for) that were later used to showcase the foolishness of the very idea of government- sponsored development. Needless to say, within a few years many of the poorer na- tions themselves teetered on the brink of default. It was at this point that the U.S. Treasury, working closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), fixed on a policy that under no circumstances were such debts to be written off.[5] This was, I should note, a major departure from previous economic orthodoxy, which took it for granted that those who lend money are assuming a certain risk. It showcases, in fact, a crucial element of neoliberalism: that, while the poor are to be held ac- countable for poor economic decisions (real or imagined), the rich must never be. In practical effect, it meant that even if a banker were to lend a hundred million dollars to a corrupt dictator, knowing full well that he was likely to place the sum directly in his personal Swiss bank account, and even if that dictator were to be sub- sequently ousted by a popular uprising, he could rest assured that the full appara- tus of world government and financial institutions would lock into step to insist the money could still be recovered\u2014at generous rates of interest\u2014from the dictator\u2019s former victims. If thousands therefore had to starve, so be it.\"",

It's basically about either creating disasters or exploiting disasters in order to push a neoliberal agenda of deregulation, privatisation, tax reduction, and social spending cuts. The IMF was started as an organization that would render aid to countries on the brink of collapse in order to maintain global stability. From the 80s onward that aid was conditioned on that country honoring the debts accrued by previous administrations, as well as creating an environment suitable for global finance i.e. the richest people in existence. This left countries with massive debts to the IMF, and by extension the United States, with no way to pay it off because those same capitalists bought up thier industries and resources at fire-sale prices. Mind you, this debt trap is all created in the midst of a disaster, real or imagined. It's all very nefarious.",
