That feels good. And I spend time in nature or do creative stuff and sing and drum. We're not the crazy ones it's our sick civilization that has to be eliminated. But there's nothing but the typical useless liberal protests if I can even get to them. I'm literally starting to stand on a street corner with a \"Resist\" flag at what passes as rush hour. Do what you can. Look for and give support. I'll definitely chat with anyone who needs it. We are on the right side of history. This oppressive regime and civilization will not last forever. They want us to give up. Don't you dare. Solidarity and mutual aid is always how humans get through the toughest times. Take care of yourself.",

Maybe all you can do is grow a garden or learn how to play a musical instrument. But if that helps you through and makes you stronger, that's a good thing",

I urge you, and everyone else who is really struggling, to seek out and be part of a community.\n\nI know that is easier said than done in many places, especially small towns. Having grown up in a small town I know firsthand how challenging it is to find people who really align with your values. But they exist, and the sooner you find them, the sooner you will be able to overcome the feelings of isolation and fear. Solidarity is how we win this fight. It\u2019s easy for keyboard activists to preach purity politics, but purity politics won\u2019t save humanity. Open your horizons. Seek common ground with people, instead of looking at differences. \n\nObviously you\u2019re gonna wanna punch every fascist you meet, that\u2019s a given. But don\u2019t shy away from making friends with people who aren\u2019t also students of anarchism. There\u2019s a diverse range of us on the Left. Find them and be their friend, even if you don\u2019t agree on everything. It\u2019ll strengthen your views while allowing you to engage with other people with patience and respect. And again, punch all fascists. With your new friends. Trust me, it\u2019ll be worth it. Then use your new connections to make your community better. Feed homeless people. Join in mutual aid efforts. Volunteer in your community. Help others. Organize. Anarchism is about making communities more resilient. Do that.",

Whenever I start doing something and feel like it's important, I get anxiety about it and can't focus. And then after I do something I feel like it's small and inconsequential and I'm not doing enough.\n\nI'm mentally kind of built for emergencies, like I can usually keep a clear head in moments when other people are panicking. But lately the world seems like 1 long emergency, and I'm just getting depressed and laying around and sleeping at random times (aside from going to work)",
