It's short and has some pretty important discussion of the roots of anarchist thought in Freemasonry/Occult texts and groups. An interesting counterpoint to the insistence that true anarchism is atheistic. Also worth it for the discussion this brings up regarding coloniality, classism and sexism in modern anarchism. I also just find it fun to read about unusual and exciting topics - see also David Graeber's *Pirate Enlightenment*.",
