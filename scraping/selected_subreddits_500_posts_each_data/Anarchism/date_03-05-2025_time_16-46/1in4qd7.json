    "selftext": "Hi everyone.  I hope this post finds you well and with some nourishment and loved ones bringing colour into your life.  I wanted to inquire with this sub about some existential questions I am having regarding my own life path, and I guess a request for some advice.\n\nI am a white settler (30m) currently living in a city where I've been for the past 6 years.  I was not born here but I have developed many good relationships here with people, projects, and the land.  I spent my first 4 years here involved in activism and advocacy, particularly regarding housing justice, until I 'burned out' and my energy output became unsustainable.  Since that time two years ago, I've been struggling to reorient my life path towards meaningful, longterm projects.  The reality of rent, food prices, traffic congestion, etc. is, of course, fairly suffocating. I have found my own ways to manage but systemically I don't have faith in things getting better.\n\nPresently, I have some good friends living in a rural area 2 hours from the city, who would gladly welcome me into their community.  Most amenities are 15-45 minutes away but there is plentiful access to land, and good soil for farming/gardening.  I have access to an offgrid land project with dear friends where we could live ruggedly and supporting one another.  There are many enticing things about this rural life: the directness of growing my own food, fetching my own water, firewood, building structures from scraps, doing all of this with friends. But I have some hangups.  Namely, I feel that I would be \"cashing in\" on my whiteness and intergenerational wealth in a way that compromises my values, i.e. prioritizing my own comfort over vulnerable strangers, inevitably dedicating a higher proportion time & energy to off-grid chores, driving, etc.  Of course there would be the possibility of developing more relationships with locals and creating mutual aid projects.  And even though it is a very white region, there are historic Black and Indigenous communities \\~30-40 minutes away that I could develop more of a relationship with. Ultimately, I'm struggling to shake the idea that \"the city\" is where I should be because of it's density of \"important frontlines of social struggle,\" and I also really enjoy its internationalist nature, density of young people, sometimes night-life...\n\nPerhaps my internal conflict of \"anarchism in the city vs. the country\" is unnecessarily dualistic, yet it feels true that they are very different lifestyles.   With the reduced stress of living rurally (rent-free baby!) I would enjoy dedicating more time to writing, researching, and possibly even publishing anarchist histories.  Other than that I don't exactly have a skilled trade, but I have made myself handy for carpentry & construction jobs in the past.\n\nAny resources, insights, or experiences you feel compelled to share would be greatly beneficial to me.  I appreciate you taking time to read this.  In solidarity !",
