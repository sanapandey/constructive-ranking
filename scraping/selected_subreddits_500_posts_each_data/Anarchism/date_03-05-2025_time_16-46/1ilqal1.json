I'm also disabled though, and need medication and don't really want to be syntheising or compounding that myself. For one, I don't have the skillset and for two, there are people who want to do that stuff. Similarly, I use a power assisted wheelchair which requires technology and infrastructure to even be made.\n\nThere's for sure a need for space that understands that consumerism sucks, overconsumption isn't cool and we don't need a bunch of plastic crap but also understanding that technologies (including medicine, phones, computers and even The Internet) aren't inherently bad. Rather, they are badly used by the current socioeconomic context in which we find ourselves.",

I'm not saying it's bad to get a treat for yourself or buying something you really like, I mean that capitalist and neoliberal societies often portray consumption as this essential thing you need to do in order to be happy in life. I must admit there are obvious things you need to buy in order to survive, but, what I'm pointing is that capitalism and neoliberalism often create false needs in us, leading to overcomsuption and consumism. In real life conversations, I've found really difficult to explain to people that they don't really need the last iPhone, that they don't need to buy all the trendy clothing, that they don't need to buy the most expensive food. There's nothing wrong with wanting these little luxuries, it's wrong when it becomes a need, which can lead people to, as a said before, overconsumption and consumism",

Land is capital. Nature itself is capital. The bar to entry for that lifestyle is so high that only the wealthy could live like that. Which is ironic, because none of them would. The rest of us would be on the hook for making that land productive or lose it. That process would destroy the simplicity, destroy the quiet, and destroy nature.",
