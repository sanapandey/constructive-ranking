            "body": "Any other anarchist women (especially those of us who are 30+) feel that they're often compelled to take on the role of substitute mother in anarchist (or radical in general) spaces?\n\nFor context: I was diagnosed with autism when I was a young girl, which was unusual for the time. Because I had a diagnosis, my parents instilled it in me for most of my life that I was a *very bad person* since I was rude, aggressive, and spoke my mind a lot, but due to my autism diagnosis all of my rudeness was pathologized. So, in order to compensate for being a *bad bad girl* I became overly nice as an adult woman. Anarchists are very big into mutual aid, so throughout the years I've found myself giving *a lot* to others (helps that I have a job and am financially stable). But recently, I'm starting to rethink it all. A lot of people I know in these spaces/subcultures (namely, men) demand I give them money or emotional support without giving me anything in return. So I end up helping pay for people's rent, legal fees, medical bills, bike repair, ADHD medication, whatever, and give them a shoulder to cry on when they need one, yet every time I ask one of those people to help me and give me support they always turn me down. I hate that people see me as a \"mother\" of sorts and treat me like I have to serve them without any reciprocation. Am I a bad anarchist for just not wanting to be a \"mother\" to other comrades anymore?",

                    "body": "If I understand it correctly, the underlying concept of doing anarchy 'right' is to support every persons right to be self-determining. This would include a right for you to fully and freely consent, or withhold consent, to gifts and support given to others. Yes, mutual aid is important, but the foundational idea is self-determination without coercion or control. It sounds like you may be under some kind of (internal or external or both) coercion in feeling that you 'must' support others regardless of how you personally feel about it. This dynamic actually goes against the concept of anarchy. \n\nSaying 'yes' and 'no' from a place of authenticity makes you a 'good' anarchist. You are free to do the things that are right for you to do. Sometimes that might look like sharing your time and resources, and sometimes that might look like not sharing. Either one is fine.",
