I call things out to my coworkers when I see them, trying to unionize my job, change things from the inside, but being a low man on the totem pole it feels really hopeless sometimes. Idk I was just wondering if anyone else could relate and if we could just share ideas and vent a little here. What do you do to make change? How do you cope with being against the system but for the people you care for? Working inpatient acute psych, but open to hearing from all corners of the care field. ",

I like to think that if I was hospitalized, I would want someone with my values caring for me so I try to just do my best interpersonally and not get bogged down in the things I can\u2019t control. Corporations own our healthcare in the US and I can\u2019t effectively fight them but I can be a good human to my patients.",

            "body": "Therapist here. The worst part of the job is how broken the system is. I imagine it's worse for you, working inpatient. I am personally dealing with chronic illness, chronic pain, and autism so most clinics/hospitals just wouldn't realistically be able to give me the level of accommodations I need. Private practice allows me the freedom to make all the accommodations I need to make this a sustainable career, but private practice comes with its own set of issues. Though I try to offer a sliding scale that goes lower than a lot of others in my area, for every well-off client who is down to pay more, there are dozens of lower income folks in need of services. Though I know my labor has value, the whole money part of it makes me feel guilty. Striking the right balance is hard.\n\nMost of last year I was living paycheck to paycheck trying to deal with chronic health issues, so I'm not exactly making out like a bandit here. I often wish that somehow I could just exist in an intentional community as some kind of emotional support figure/mediator/whatever, in exchange for a relatively simple life where my needs are met... but that's not going to happen.\n\nI'm specializing in communities to fill gaps I see in mental healthcare. Such as autistic adults who aren't considered severe enough to get any adequate assistance, if any assistance at all, but who are nonetheless drowning in a world not designed for them. Or for queer (especially trans/non-binary) clients who often run into gatekeeping, ignorance, and microaggressions in the healthcare system. Being in private practice also makes it easier for me to be openly leftist in a very red state. I can engage with leftist clients on their level about how the rise of fascism affects their mental health, helping them figure out how to resist and find/build community without burning out, and so on. So, yeah, that's how I personally try to counteract how broken things are.",

I was a little worried about how my post might come across.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing great things too, so don't be too hard on yourself, okay? I know it's easy to feel very, very small in the face of such a massively broken system. Sure as hell if I were inpatient I'd want a fellow anarchist keeping an eye out and being an advocate for me. I wouldn't be surprised if you make a bigger difference than you know for the people under your care.\n\nI really hope you make strides in unionizing. But even if it doesn't happen, just remember you're still planting seeds, and opening people's eyes more to the possibility of that kind of worker solidarity. That's still important.",

            "body": "Hello, care worker from Italy here. Currently working with autistic adults. I also worked with kids, teen with ED, and elderly. It's been 12 years since I started working in this field and I really love my job. That's honestly what keeps me going. It's very difficult and sad because we see how this sick healthcare sistem work, and I often tried to talk to my co-workers about certain problems (working too many hours, shift that are too long, constantly asking people last minute to cover a shift, ...) and also it's very sad to see how some of this people that we assist are constantly prescribed too many psychotropic drug to keep them quiet.\nI honestly gave up during COVID pandemic. For us (healthcare workers) the vax was mandatory and I refused to take the shot for many reasons. Lots of co-workers were skeptical about it so we made a group and we used to see each other every week to talk about it. In the end only 4 of us didn't take it and were suspended. We were like 20+ at the beginning. This was from September 2021 to November 2022. I had rent and bills to pay, 2 pets to take care of and my bf was receiving unemployment benefits cause he finished working just before all this started. But of course it wasn't a lot of money so we struggled for quite a bit. I quit my job on June 2022 because I didn't know for how long this was going to last and they would not fire me, so I couldn't ask for unemployment benefits like my bf. I realized that if people don't care about their own health and their well being and do things just because our State say so and impose them to do it, they are not willing to do much. We like to complain a lot, but when it's time to do something not many of us actually care to invest time or energy to change things. I try to do my best, loving my patients and caring for them. As I said that's what keeps me going. And also if something doesn't sit right with me like asking me too much or things that is not in my job description I just say no and I don't care if I'm alone. We need to have our time to rest and be mentally ok to care for others.",
