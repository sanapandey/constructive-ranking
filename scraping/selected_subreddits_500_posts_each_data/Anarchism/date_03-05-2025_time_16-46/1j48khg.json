Home of the Coup-o-meter](https://isthisacoup.com/)\n\n  \nI know that not everyone who is into anarchy is also into nonviolence, but if you are, or even if you are not, this site has some interesting perspectives. \n\nNonviolent resistance is about figuring out where powerful institutions get power, and removing it. It is extremely effective. I would say that what Trump is doing IS nonviolent action. He is using his power to change and shape things to suit him. \n\nThe people have more power, collectively, than Trump or Musk ever can. \n\nWhat I learn about nonviolent resistance stands out to me as an anarchist because I have learned about how effective it can be. It just needs people to organize -people like Ghandi for example, were able to inspire people to act. \n\nI hope someone has the time and ability to influence enough people to act in ways that take the power out of Trump and Musks hands. \n\nWhile I do not support hierarchy of any type, I would like to see some organization to achieve that - and suspect it will involve hierarchical structure and organization. \n\n  \n[Waging Nonviolence](https://wagingnonviolence.org/)",
