    "selftext": "I had a conversation with a friend the other day that went something like this:\n\nFriend: \"So if you're an anarchist, then you should like what trump and musk are doing right now.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, no.\"\n\nFriend: \"But if they are trying to break down all of these various government programs and remove regulations and restrictions, isn't this in line with your worldview as an anarchist?\"\n\nMe: \"No, and let me explain. First, not every anarchist would agree with me, but I would hope most would. Second, Trump and Musk are not tearing down the government completely, they are tearing down the things standing in the way of their ability to amass more power and more money. Third, Anarchy is not a top-down process. Without the bottom up approach where communities are built upon mutual trust and mutual aid, the swift removal of parts of the US government can only lead to greater chaos. With the bottom up approach, communities learn to work together in mutually beneficial ways, cooperating for the benefit of all and removing their reliance on corporations and governments. Governments would dissolve because there is no need for them, corporations would dissolve because they would be replaced by individuals cooperating for the benefit of all. Anarchism, despite popular belief, is not synonymous with chaos, and what Trump and Musk are doing is simply causing chaos for the sake of a fascist power grab.\"\n\nThis is a watered down and simplified version of the exchange, but I'm curious if you all agree, or what your thoughts are on the current actions being taken to reduce many aspects of the American government by Trump and his team.",

And yes, anarchism is against the state, but it's also against capitalism, white supremacy, patriarchy, imperialism, colonialism, and any other oppressive power structures that are rooted in the principle of hierarchy, wherein people are ranked one over another in terms of status and authority. Anarchists seek to counter this through the decentralization of power in order to create horizontality.\n\nPoint out the irony in how chaotic the current hierarchical order is. By being made to think that the most viable way to live is to take part in a giant rat race, we forget what it means to be human.",

It's definitely a good thing for US empire to falter and weaken, even though it means that poor people in the US will have it worse. Poor people around the world have a lot to gain. Leftist gains in Latin America while the US was preoccupied with the second Gulf war are one example, including building enough power to outright reject to FTAA (After seeing what NAFTA did to Mexico).\n\n\nTrump is trying to weaken the US on behalf of Russia, and there's essentially zero anarchists supporting Putin, but US anarchists primary international focus should be on countering much of US foreign policy, and secondarily supporting international resistance movements (in recent years some Russian anarchists even defected and joined the Ukrainian military).\n\n\nThen closer to the original topic there's the embarrassment of right wing insurrectionists. Prior to Jan 6th it was a lot more fun for anarchist insurrectionists to imagine overthrowing the US government. The far right beat them to the punch a bit though, and now it's a lot clumsier to propose something similar, even as a distant fantasy.\u00a0\n\n\nOverall there's just so much work to do though, so it's easy to choose from work that overlaps more with progressive and liberal goals than with right wing ones.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example in the past year one crew I'm part of was considering starting a campaign to abolish ivy league schools (naturally motivated in past by Palestine organizing). We ended up deciding against it, mainly because higher education is already under right wing attack from so many angles.\n\n\nAt this point we're mostly just picking and choosing among the predictable crowd of folks that's motivated to do things by the Trump coup, and focusing on building preparedness and resilience for what's to come. The more flash in the pan folks are scrambling to build ICE watch networks.\u00a0\n\n\nSomewhat refreshingly but also worryingly there's a much smaller surge of liberals trying to do anything, so it's easier to network with other radicals in that context. When actual fascism occurs, no surprise that the actual anti-fascists are the most active.",

However loose cannon Trump often accidentally tells the truth about the corrupt DC apparatus and oftentimes saying the quiet part out loud about his own agenda. Meanwhile Biden was all mealy mouth lies.\n\n---------\n\nAlso USAID and NED are deeply corrupt institutions that enforce US empire overseas under the guise of foreign aid and promoting Democracy. Also Musk wants to audit the pentagon again as the pentagon miserably fails all audits. Then there's the JFK and MLK files that might be released. Also I was a Tulsi Gabbard supporter in 2020 and interviewed her at a campaign event. Trump also doesn't start foreign wars as much as recent dems but did just hand over Gaza to Israel on a silver platter like a real asshole.",

I also feel like the good I think it does is why musk and Trump want to stop it, and the bad things it does might be the only reason they\u2019d keep it around.
