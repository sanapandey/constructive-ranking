As I read more about anarchism and its principles I cannot help but feel wrong for purchasing clothing to simply \u201cexpress myself\u201d when others can use that money for so much more. I am curious if anyone has had similar feelings and what they did with those feelings?\n\nty for reading",

The \"there is no ethical consumption under capitalism\" indeed rings true, but as a refusal to participate or invest in a system or systems that destroy and exploit humanity and the Earth, it's reasonable to boycott certain brands and products (I don't eat meat or fast food, for instance). The conundrum emerges as to what the severity is of the company that produces the clothing. It's overpriced and made with heavily exploited labor, often in the underdeveloped world. This is the case with most commodities.\n\nI am also big into clothing: I am highly selective with what I wear, get things tailored/altered, often wear neckties (with sweaters when it's cold) and even clean my shoes and boots with relative frequency. I take clothing seriously. Clothing is how one communicates. Thus I am usually the odd one out in anarchist spaces (book fairs, etc.) although usually then I am just usually wearing some casual button-up shirt, plaid or plain.\n\nThe thing is though, I just buy basically everything second-hand. Lots of modern flashy upscale fashion is blah to me.",

If you're able to swing it, buying high quality clothes once instead of cheap, sweatshop produced clothes a bunch of times, is the way to go imho, as long as you actually use them for their whole lifespan and attempt to repair them",

            "body": "It's an interesting parallel that you're having this dilemma at the exact same time that I am starting to consider how to use fashion choices to express myself for the first time in my life (in my 30s). Part of my doing that has been a result of the wider personal growth and self-exploration I've been doing as part of deepening my understanding of left wing and socially progressive politics and philosophies. Asking myself who I am, what my identity means to me and how do I want to express it, is helping me build the confidence to actually do things and not just obsess over figuring out the perfect answers before acting.\n\nYou are responsible for the evils of the system. You aren't responsible for saving anyone. What you do have is an opportunity to help make the situation a little bit better, but to do that you need to be bringing your whole and authentic self. That means knowing what you need to feel like you, to be expressing yourself properly, and to take care of yourself. It also means knowing what things aren't key for you, and not letting external influences push you into spending money or energy on them anyway. As long as you're maintaining that balance, my opinion is you're doing better than most and all that can be expected of you.\n\nThe situation sucks. We can make it better. We don't have to self-flagellate to do so, and in fact beng miserable will make it harder.",

Especially if you're buying high quality pieces, secondhand pieces, making your clothing, or  buying from small retailers who are sustainable and ethically conscious. There's also nothing wrong with having bought a lot of fast fashion and then realizing how bad it really is and changing your ways (I'm definitely in this camp.) \n\nSome things you could do if you enjoy clothing and fashion is make sure to buy secondhand first, making or buying local and as sustainable as you can second, finding a further away sustainable retailer, and then maybe just not buying something if you can't find it in one of those places or make it yourself. \n\nYou could also do things like start clothing swaps in your area. I've done this and it's a lot of fun. \n\nYou could learn to sew if you haven't already and offer to mend people's items. I also do this and it's a lot of fun! You can also learn to upcycling pieces of clothing that people no longer want or are unwearable for whatever reason. \n\nThere's a lot you can do in the realm of clothing and fashion that can help the world, actually! I love self expression and I love helping people express themselves in authentic to them, sustainable, ethical ways. :)",

Shop at a thrift store. Learn to sew. Find companies that produce their clothes ethically. I've bought a few items from a company that plants trees with every clothing purchase. Buy items from the gray market if you have access.\n\nIt's ok to want to express yourself. Passion for fashion is legitimate. Being an anarchist doesn't require that you sacrifice things you love. But desiring to live ethically will help you to become more creative.\n\nI also want to mention that it isn't your job to save the world. It's ok to indulge yourself. You can make room in your budget for charity/anarchy related activities *and* buying clothes that you love.\n\nTBH, conventional people are very shallow. They only believe what beautiful or well dressed people say. There's strategy in making yourself fashionable so that can help the cause.",

My grandfather was a socialist in my family's native country, as well as the village tailor. And it was because of his position being the tailor that he was able to rally the people of the aldea against the Catholic Church and throw out several priests who were raping the indigenous girls and stealing money from the people (as the church does lol). My family was excommunicated for it and have been atheist ever since, with me grandfather proudly displaying his letter of excommunication from the Vatican on the family room wall! He was even elected as the councilman twice because of this. But, this was in the 1930s. Being a tailor was more of a thing than it is now lol\n\nETA: this search engine helps\nhttps://www.ethicalconsumer.org/about-us/our-ethical-ratings",
