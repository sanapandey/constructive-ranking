    "selftext": "So I ask you, do you think of Trump as a saviour, the spokesman for the 1%, looking to strip Greenland of its mineral wealth and now carve up the Ukraine in the same way, plans for the carve up are already in place as to in Palestine and because Trump has no principles and is a con artist and scammer he will give Putin and Netanyahu enough of this carve up to keep them happy. To ensure this happens this time after not getting it done last time, the rich have installed Musk as the enforcer, a man with even less principles and morals. The con is of course that they are anti deep state, when in fact they are an intrinsic part of it. You won't get the real rich and powerful people exposing themselves to us. Trump says of course that he is doing this to make America great again, but it's a scam, it is to enrich himself and his richest on the planet further, those living on the streets and working a double on minimum wage won't benefit. Those who are middle class will soon find this out too. How, you ask, well musk has already spoken of robots and the AI revolution, this is where people need to really worry, automated workforces and AI driven media and propaganda will silence us all and when we are all replaced by automated workforces (robots) how will we feed ourselves and our families. You think Musk, Trump and their masters will see us all ok? No! Trump owned projects given to him by his dad when young as did his brother, his brother had them taken off him by his dad for carrying out maintenance work to ensure residents would not suffer squalid conditions, Donny never did this so kept them. He has never and will never care for people unless they are very rich. Trump, Musk and the richest 1% are the biggest existential threat to mankind, he opposed wars because he doesn't want the minerals destroyed, yet he is funded by the NRA to allow people to own guns and kill each other because human lives are not as important then minerals, hence he opposed climate change movements because he wishes to strip the planet of all its mineral resources and the wealth he gains from this will never flow down to ordinary people but just to the rich 1%. Trump and his enforcer Musk are the face of the dangerous elites who want everything, while leaving and giving us nothing",
