                            "body": "Thanks for the video, it is well done. But the reasoning is atrocious. Their reasoning all comes down to the fact that cryptocurrency reserves will continue increasing in value, and therefore could eventually help pay down the US debt. And that these are appreciating assets so the US should hold them. I find that ludicrous.  It isn't even clear the government should be making strategic reserves of (actual) appreciating assets (like an S&P 500 fund, for instance) in the first place. And, unlike oil or ammo or strategic metals, there is no need to hoard cryptocurrency for times of war, etc.  \n\nOne thing they did mention, is that the US doing this with taxpayer money would be very good for existing Bitcoin holders, which is pretty obviously the motive behind this.",

It's not even like a government buying up gold, where there is only one *gold* and it has inherent value. For crypto, you can always buy (and sell and re-buy) as many different types of \"coin\" as you want, create a new \"coin\", etc., all with your taxpayers' USD. The selection of *which* crypto assets to invest in and when becomes a fundamental way that wealthy interests lobby for personal profit paid for by the taxpayer.\n\nI am not at all convinced by the idea of crypto as currency, but as an asset, it's just another value that people can freely hold and trade *until* government starts getting involved in it. After that, you quickly lose agency, and your job as someone without the power to influence government trades is limited to watching what those with power will influence government into doing, aka bottom-feeding.",
