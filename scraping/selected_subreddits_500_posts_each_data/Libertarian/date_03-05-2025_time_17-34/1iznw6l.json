It is illegal to wield monopoly power in an anti-competitive (coercive) fashion. There's many different cases of this.\n\nLet's say I own 98% of all gas stations, that would be considered a monopoly, but not necessarily illegal.\n\nNow let's say I tell people \"If you or your business buy gas at any station besides my own, you can't buy gas at mine\" That would be an illegal \"exclusive-dealing agreement\". I am not competing in the market, I am using my market control to starve out competition through coercion. \n\nLet's say I also offer car washes, and tell people \"You can only buy gas from my shop, if you also buy a car wash\". That would be a \"tying agreement\". Through my monopoly power on gas sales, I am coercing you into also buying a car wash.\n\nLet's say every time someone opens a new gas station, I cut my prices at the gas stations near them, and sell at a loss, to force them to sell out to me. Relying on my monopoly power of other stations to keep me afloat. That's predatory Pricing, I am using my monopoly power to coerce you to sell out your business.\n\nMost libertarians, if they believe in anti-trust at all, would likely align with the Chicago School rather than the Traditional (Harvard) School. The Harvard School is more concerned with did a violation occur and preventing monopoly power at all, the Chicago School is more concerned with \"What is the impact to the market?\".\n\nThe Chicago School says that if monopoly power is not being used coercively, and it benefits the market, then there is no problem.",
