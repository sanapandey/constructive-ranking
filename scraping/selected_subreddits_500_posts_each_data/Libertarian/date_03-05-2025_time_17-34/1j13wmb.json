I hear too many right leaning folks that just tow party lines and never voice opposition. \n\nThis is going to turn into a rant so bear with me. At this point my biggest things are that trump is not pro gun, he is not pro free speech, and he is not pro autonomy. Those are just facts. If he was, the press would not be limited in the Oval Office. If he was, he wouldn\u2019t be purging our military of ready and willing transgender soldiers. And all the lies about Russia starting the war? He acts like we\u2019re all fucking stupid and don\u2019t remember. He is intentionally rewriting history so that he can further his own interests. It\u2019s very troubling and I find it insulting. He\u2019s a convicted felon that is not legally supposed to vote or own a gun and yet, he is the most powerful of all of us.",

If you believe that than abortion should be illegal on any level, its not something that should be legislated by the state either.  Again I don\u2019t support that argument, but if you do not sure why the federal government or the State of California can morally say otherwise.\n\nAs far as abortion restrictions.  The Trump administration has out on several restrictions at the federal level such as the Mexico City policy which blocks  non governmental agencies from promoting or referring abortions.  They have also reimplemented the Hyde Amendment which bars federal funds from being used for abortions.  They also banned funding of abortions for female service members. They also may <still tbd> join the effort to ban mail order medications women use for abortions.",

That said I too would love to see a mob of libertarians put in charge of these agencies. But I don't think it would go slow or careful that way either. \n\nNow don't mistake me for an accerationist - I'm not that, I just think what whoever gets in charge of this process is going to have the other side screaming 'you are going too fast and you are being too hasty in your cuts'. It is an easy defense. But when I see things like the DOD failing to audit themselves 7 years running and telling everyone 'that's ok, we will get it right next time, trust us' I get fed up with this slow approach nonsense.\n\nIf this was the private sector someone would lose their job the second year the audit failed (if not the first). The fifth year the audit failed I would expect the shareholders to replace the whole C-Suite. Here we are year seven and this looks like malicious refusal to perform the audit.\n\nThat short of thing does need decisive change to fix it. If a department is that frozen, from a business change perspective, they need some serious disruption. Now I'm not sure DOGE is going to cut deep enough (and we do need some deep cuts to get us out of this debt mess) and I too have fears that this may all be political theater, but I do want changes made and soon.",

It used to be that they where the party of big pharma and the military industrial complex. That is still the case for 'establishment' Republicans. However things have started to take a turn, at least on their surface. \n\nIt is hard to actually read politics from what people say, because they hide their intentions. It is better to pay attention to what they do. \n\nBy and large Trump has been seen as an outsider with the old republican order. The republican 'never Trumpers' were a big force in the media appearances of the 2024 republican primary and they were a thorn in his  administration's side during his first term. \n\nThis perception is why Trump tends to be so popular with the common republican voter (who has been voting for lower taxes and less spending for decades now, only to get more corrupt DC spending without end, both from the dems and establishment republicans). The fact that he is crass and uses unpolished language that is so different from that of the DC career politicians is seen as further proof that he is not one of them. \n\nTrump's trolling, aggrandizing, and general lambasting of the media (which most republicans do not trust due to the obvious, decades long left bias in media reporting) is also seen as a net positive. He doesn't play the game the way they do, further evidence that he is an outsider. Sure Trump is far more wealthy that the average republican but they are numb to that fact. They are used to seeing the wealthy and corrupt in DC, so that doesn't immediately disqualify Trump.\n\nThat core of the common republican voter is currently in contention with the Neo-con part of the republican party. In the past the republican party was seen as the war hawk party, eager to flex the military might of the US when called for. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars and subsequent occupations, coupled with a deteriorating situation domestically (the housing crisis and issues under Obama) have left the common republican asking questions about why we are funding 'forever wars'. Interestingly it has done nothing to diminish the nationalish pride of the common republican voter.\n\nTrump not starting and not funding wars that are unpopular with common Republicans is seen as a huge point in his favor by many. \n\nCovid and the Biden push (we can argue who was pushing to make Covid vaccines mandatory but most Republicans see it as something the Biden administration did) for vaccines left many Republicans longing for the return to normalcy that a Trump presidency would represent to them.\n\nSo now the tables have turned and the democrats are seen as the party of big pharma and the military industrial complex party. This is made clear by the military's acceptance of the 'woke agenda' under Biden and evidenced in the way the Ukraine war started under Biden, the Afghanistan withdrawal fell apart resulting in an undoing of any good the US did in Afghanistan, and in the release of funds to Iran and the subsequent attack of Hamas (known to be funded by Iran) on Israeli.\n\nRepublicans now percive the democrats as being behind a push to censor discussion of Covid, the push to squelch discussion of a peace deal in Ukraine, and as enabling the Hamas attacks in Israel. \n\nIt also doesn't help that the Biden administration, with the help of the media, gaslit the American public about the boarder situation and the rise of inflation. In both cases the stories started off with 'it isn't happening', progressed to 'well there is nothing we can do about it', and then progressed to 'well you are reading this wrong, it is a good thing'.",

I hate that he's talking about ethnic cleansing in Gaza and trying to sell it like a monorail in Springfield. I dislike all that rhetoric about Palestinians dying but never saying how, why, or who is killing them and constantly blaming Hamas as if they exist in a vacuum. MAGA doesn't know the distinction between America First and ZOG and most are willfully ignorant when it comes to Palestine and Israel. I also don't like the rhetoric when it comes to China as is they're any more than just an economic threat to us. Lastly, he really needs to ditch the neocons like Graham.",

I've personally seen the government take land, lie about their plans for it, and break their promises for the future too many times. \n\nI consider myself a classical liberal, believing in self reliance, equality, free speech, free markets, a well armed people, the corrupting effect of power, and keeping government's role in my personal life as small as possible. I don't care what people do in the privacy of their bedrooms as long as it is consensual and doesn't involve minors. I object to state propaganda. Each year it feels like team blue moves further from these values.\n\nAll too often I see team blue trying to shut down free speech and encouraging censorship. Not saying that team red are angels in this regard but this past decade team blue has been on overdrive. It is telling to me, because no matter what side you are on speech should always be free, it is basis of every honest dialog.",

Certain figures in media, however, make money largely off the division between the two parties, further reinforcing to people that the \u201cenemy\u201d is the other party and not the wealthy individuals actively lobbying against the working class. I may be wrong, but I personally believe issues such as trans rights and immigration have largely become points of interest simply to distract from the fact that almost everyone is getting fucked in the long run.
