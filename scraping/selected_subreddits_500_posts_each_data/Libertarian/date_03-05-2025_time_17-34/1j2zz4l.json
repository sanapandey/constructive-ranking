Grok agrees this adheres to a plain reading of the Constitution.\n\n**1.7 Principle of Constitutional Interpretation**\n\nAll Free State Militia regulations adhere to the foundational principle that \"The Constitution was written to be understood by the voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning.\" *United States v. Sprague*, 282 U.S. 716, 731 (1931); *see also Gibbons v. Ogden*, 9 Wheat. 1, 188 (1824). Normal meaning may of course include an idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings that would not be known to ordinary citizens.\n\nThis principle ensures that these regulations remain clear, accessible, and comprehensible to all members of the militia and the public, reflecting the Constitution\u2019s intent as a document designed for the people. By grounding our interpretative framework in the ordinary understanding of language, the Free State Militia upholds transparency and maintains the trust of those it serves, who are the ultimate authority in a constitutional republic.",
