    "selftext": "Proposal: mandatory supply chain and Manufacturing transparency.\n\nRational: iv long been an advocate of lesser regulation under the premise that if business a sells rotten apples no one's going to buy them. Market pressures will ensure that business A sells Good Apples or goes out of business.\n\nHowever the ability for individuals, and so the market to make informed decisions is entirely dependent on the free access information available to them. If business A is able to hide the fact that their apples are bad then surely the market can't correct. \n\nImagine if every business as a part of doing business had to release a transparency report detailing every resource they use and any manufacturing method they employ. That way every individual could at their own leisure look up business a. And they can see that they sell a certain type of apple. On a certain amount of acreage using a certain amount of water. They harvest the apples using a certain machine. And then they link to the manufacturer of that machine. And then the manufacturer of that machine, as a part of their business has their own transparency report. Which dictates how they made it what resources they use to manufacture it with and the chain goes all the way down to the wood used to make the ax. The Great pencil open source.\n\nThe only cons against this concept that I can immediately think of. Is publishing and maintaining that kind of report isn't free. But once enough businesses have made them the cost would go down but never zero. And one might worry about copycats trademark infringements, I would argue that's what patents are for.",

There needs to be nutrition labels on food products, tech companies need your consent for them to collect data on you, and most of the time saying your eggs are 'cage free' or whatever is usually a marketing tactic, and the check for people lying about that would be lawsuits.",

Or a doctor?\n\nThe distributor selling that product is the expert. If they tell me the car is good, i have to trust him. If he is s liar, thats fraud. If hes truthful, he deserves to be rewarded with more business. That business will earn a reputation as a trustworthy source for goods/services. \n\nExample: Temu competes on price. You mightyl get lucky and find something good, but it's a meme now that temu quality is awful. So I dont shop there.",
