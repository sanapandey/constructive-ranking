He borrowed a lot from Perot while recognizing that he had to give on social issues. He took some from Obama, in that he realized that our current polarization means the right play is cementing the base and making the right enemies. He learned from Clinton that strategic unorthodoxy makes one seem more authentic. He read the room on immigration and figured out that there is no limit to how far one can go on that issue, particularly when it comes to illegals.",
