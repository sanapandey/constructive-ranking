However, Donald Trump continues his assault of EOs implementing the Heritage Foundation's Mandate for Leadership (Project )2025.  This is not hyperbole, they are making swift progress on implementing this plan so far.\n\nIn particular this [EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reins-in-independent-agencies-to-restore-a-government-that-answers-to-the-american-people/)\n\nThe wording of the EO sounds awesome at face value, especially the title. But most of the things he is doing is to concentrate the power in the Executive Branch with loyalists to him, not to the American people.   It is truly all laid out in Project 2025.\n\n[Discussion](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302481/trump-independent-agencies)\n\n[Humphrey's Executor Discussion](https://apnews.com/article/humphreys-executor-supreme-court-trump-independent-agencies-8facfe6107fa94b28f391734d1620fe4)\n\nI think general libertarian consensus is that most of these agencies should not exist, so some may argue that bringing them back under direct Executive rule is the next best thing, including ability to fire the heads of the \"independent agencies\" at will.\n\nI reiterate that I don't trust Trump and his consolidation of power.  Nor the people in his court.  As libertarians we praise reducing the budget and size of the federal government.  But I am skeptical at best of why they are doing it.\n\nHe also keeps \"joking\" about a third term, brining up a quote from Napoleon, stating that he is the Federal Law, sucking up to Putin. There are myriad things to be concerned with and it makes me trust him and his motivations and end goals even less as every day goes by.",

You can find examples for each and every one making policy which should be a vote in congress I\u2019m sure.  Idk how you draw the line because clearly 535 people cannot do every single policy of the government.  You can\u2019t have unelected agency heads making wide ranging policy decisions though either.  And they do.  Which leads back to the ultimate point.  Government has far too much power over every aspect of life.   There \u201cindependent\u201d agencies have become another theater of lawfare with both sided putting in partisans to extend their sided power in whatever manner however they can get away with.",

It\u2019s becoming all too easy for allegations to take away gun rights without any due process.  Due process is important and the mechanisms to restore 2A right in relation to red flag are not what they should be.  The mechanism for restoration must be much more streamlined and fast.  The thought of a faceless accuser getting you swatted by a police force is abhorrent to the concept of freedom.  Same as I don\u2019t support permits for protests which is abused.
