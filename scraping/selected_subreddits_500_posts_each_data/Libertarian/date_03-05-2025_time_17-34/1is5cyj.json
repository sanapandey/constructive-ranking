If you don't understand that, you're in the wrong subreddit. \n\nChattel slavery only existed for that long because of state coercion backing the slave owner class. It perpetuates a coercive model of the economy that, as attested to post civil war, was unsustainable. Because it fundamentally is not about policy in the political sense but the subjugation and commodification enforced by the state of an entire class of human beings. The 13th Amendment is 2 sentences and the second just a procedural grant of authority. The first part does not rearrange the economy by decree, nor does it legislate morality unless your view of morality is so narrow as to be prescriptive - and prescribed by the state, no less. And abolitionism isn't a special interest, no more than liberalism, or the most basic concept found in the constitution that all men are created equal. If that is a special interest to you, what the hell isn't a special interest? It's a ludicrous way to parse the amendment. The mistake is the exception provided within the amendment. State-enforced chattel slavery is effectively a giant subsidy. The amendment does not prescribe the manner or timeline as to how emancipation was to occur, because it wasn't needed. Liberty is a human right, not a human privilege. To live as a free person with agency is the aberration, and all the 13th Amendment did was to reaffirm what should have been obvious and was obvious to a majority of people anyway - that a person is not a piece of property to be owned, never mind owned without consent and in a permanent state. If a slave economy can be justified based on efficiency, one wonders why the south lost since the north was by no means efficient by today's standards. The lost cause was never lost, it never existed as a legitimate cause to begin with. Friedman's entire point is that the individual is capable of making decisions on their own in a manner far better because liberty enables them to choose freely. The 13th Amendment restores (mostly) society to this self-evident principle. His most popular book is named \"Free to Choose\" for crissakes. Are you arguing that slavery, hierarchy enforced by the state, and coercion as the driving force of the economy was... liberty? That the founders were kidding about all men being created  equal? \n\nI hope to god that this was a bad troll, because otherwise you really hung your hat on libertarians or in my case, an individualist anarchist to not have read the constitution, or Locke, Smith, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, or really literature from different traditions that all describe liberty in similar terms. One problem: this is a free society where one carries their own hat or wear it, and you just lost yours.",

Of course, they can't see the future, but we have over 150 years of hindsight and documentation by this point.\n\nYour central argument is that humans, regardless of consent or even knowledge, can be property. Not their labor, mind you, but the person itself. But that begs the question: life, liberty, property, why do you need to create a distinct separation between life and property if life can simply be property? The mere existence of a market is irrelevant when the market is created entirely from the supply-side pressure, a product looking for a market, so to speak. Take fentanyl: it had a market, Actiq pops have been front line treatment palliative care medication for decades, but the latest wave that cause the most damage was entirely a product of policy and fueled by a supply-side replacement via aggressive enforcement on the demand side. Arguably even today there's little true demand for fent. Anyone who has IVed opiates pre 2014 or so and have a frame of reference will tell you that it's one of the least fun and least worthwhile opiate/opioids to IV. And this was both a vile intervention that amounted to the state creating a problem for it to solve and a throwback to the origin of the transatlantic slave market, of which there were two that were considered legitimate at the time, the asiento out of Spain/Portugal band the Royal African Company. Notably, both were excise farms, aka government established monopolies that it then sold off or used as collateral to obtain funds from private entities. Thanks to wars and geopolitics, by the 1700s the British had both. It is not a free market, and it was not operated by private actors but according to state-created rules. It's a market if you consider Maoist China a market economy, except even Maoist China did not sell human being as property, however little it rearded the value of human life. \n\nAnd the markets were merchanilist systems until the British were able to consolidate in a single merchaniilist system. It's not a coincidence that moral philosophy by the likes of Smith came about at pretty much exactly the same time. Smith was pessimistic about abolition because once you had such power, few would simply give it away gratis. The British government paid enormous sums to slave owners during their abolitionist efforts. In any case, slavery as an institution was in fact incredibly inefficient and one of the primary reasons why the north industrialized earlier and quicker. And the North is not a special interest group, for crissakes. It's not a monolith, and it's not even a singularly consistent concept.\n\nAnd the 13th Amendment did not mention markets, because by then there were no markets for it to abolish. The war did not start as an attempt for the union to end slavery but to prevent the south from leaving the union in order to force the institution of slavery to continue. It's literally in the state constitution. Yes, it was for states' rights, but that right is to regard humans as property from birth to death. Slavery was maintained by the state with laws such as the fugitive slave act. In fact, no state could join the confederacy without explicit legalization of slavery, the popular sentiment be damned. If that's is not coercive on different levels, please tell me what would.\n\nUltimately though, you are arguing that humans are property to be sold as a legitimate commodity. So, you are fine if you get kidnapped tomorrow and be forced into a system of chatteldom? Good to know. Your boss would love to know that you don't mind not getting paid, I'm sure. If your regard for self-ownership is this shallow, I'd worry that you don't have enough self-ownership to be sold into slavery, frankly. \n\nIt'd be helpful before you do some reading from Spooner to Boaz  before making glib arguments. Friedman does not speak in a vacuum, after all.",
