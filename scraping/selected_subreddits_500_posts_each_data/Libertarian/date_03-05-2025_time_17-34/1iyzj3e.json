I am curious if most people who consider themselves Libertarian have always been so or if you became one due to any specific thing.\n\nLately I find it shocking that people on the Left and Right still feel like govovernment can effectively fix any major issue we face.  Everything is a trade off.  Personally, I just want government out of the way. \n\nDo people feel like Libertarian views could ever become the majority?  Are we doomed to be Left Vs Right until everything collapses?",

They don't start with principles and see how they apply, they start with their conclusions and then bend or abandon principles entirely when it suits them. Some examples:\n\n\\-The left wants no guns, but drugs are okay.\n\n\\-The right wants no drugs, but guns are okay.\n\n\\-The right likes the death penalty but hates abortion\n\n\\-Reverse that for the left\n\n\\-The right says they want to shrink government, but never do\n\n\\-The left hates the police but wants to hand as much power to the fed as possible\n\nThere are literally too many contradictions to count, and libertarians are the only people I've found who start with principles and try to apply them consistently across the whole range of policy questions.",

And I think libertarianism is really easy to apply for social issues. \n\nThe part that gets difficult with libertarianism is trying to figure out what parts of the government and how much of it to keep intact in order to preserve individual liberties. Especially because there\u2019s always people trying to get an edge outside of free market interactions through scams and predatory practices so how do you balance trying to keep the government small with still wanting to crack down on those things. \n\nOne problem I see is proposed libertarian cuts to government always come across as kooky nonsense to the righty and lefties who are accustomed to how big the fed has become. Better verbiage to propose cuts would be to say something like \u201creturn the government to the 1920\u2019s level\u201d so that the cuts don\u2019t sound so crazy and unprecedented.",

A lot of Libertarians come to their views over time, usually after seeing how ineffective government intervention can be. They get frustrated with both sides thinking the government can fix everything. Me for example, I was a communist and hard line Liberal, then I became a capitalist and conservative, now I'm a libertarian\n\nAs for Libertarianism becoming the majority, it\u2019s tough to say. The political system is so entrenched in the Left-Right divide, but there\u2019s definitely growing interest in limited government, especially among gen-z(me). If enough people realize that less government might actually lead to more freedom and innovation, there could be a shift.\n\nThe \"Logistically it is impossible. That's why Libertarians are compared to house cats. They're independent unless they want you to feed them. So they're still dependent on the system but they like to pretend they are not.\" Type argument mentioned are frustrating, though. It paints Libertarians as idealistic but impractical, which misses the point entirely. It's not about rejecting all systems but about minimizing unnecessary ones, especially those that hinder personal freedom and innovation. It\u2019s important to remind people that less government doesn\u2019t mean no government, but a more responsible and limited role. Dispel those myths, and maybe more people will see the potential for a government that empowers individuals instead of trying to control every aspect of life, I know way to many kids that unironically think Communism is good.",

I almost couldn't spend the money fast enough to dump our budget before the fiscal year ran out. Because I was good at it, we ended up with a bunch of money from other units who couldn't spend it in time.

Now, we got Trudeau.\n\nI am both a gun enthusiast and a car enthusiast (wtf is even money lol). In the last 2 decades, racetracks have been sued or fined to closure. We have also had quite the mess of gun control fuckery going on.\n\nIn the meantime, we get piss poor healthcare, the worse roads I have seen of all the places I visited in the world and endless corruption going on around montreal.\n\nI made a rough estimate of what my real tax burden is, and it's around 50%. I'm not even in the 6 digits. Give me my money back, I'll pay for quality healthcare myself, thank you.\n\nHave you ever heard of anyone ever losing money selling drugs? Look no further. The SQDC managed to make a huge loss in their first year.\n\nEverything these clown touches becomes worse.\n\nOn top of that shit, it seems the average moron here wants even more social services. I really don't understand what's wrong with them.\n\nI'm not totally against all governement, but I think we could do with about 10% of what we have.\n\nEdit: I'll be fair and say that I am generally satisfied with Hydro-qu\u00e9bec.

That certainly pushed me away from my families liberal beliefs. Over time I learned and changed, my beliefs became more defined and ended up fairly close to modern Libertarianism. \n\nI honestly don't believe any group with my view point will ever be in power, people have been too brainwashed to ever truly evaluate their beliefs and what would be best in the long term.",

I'm not entirely sure how I ended up there, but I did. Maybe because I thought that side was more logical instead of the screaming and dismissive left.\n\nCame to realise that both sides are particularly terrible and full of hypocrites. Ultimately, the best way to live life is with your civil liberties being paramount. And that the economy is best left alone, away from the government is the most ideal form of economy you can get.

Went to a few local caucus meetings, found those people blue pilled and power hungry and jealous, just like every would-be despot. Nationalism is tribalism writ large. The only morally defensible political theory is anarchism. Your best bet imo is to eschew the left right paradigm from your thinking. Identify that they are two sides of the same coin, and that genuine people are layered like an onion, and don't fit into rigid ideological constraints like left-right, dem-repub, lib-con. Appreciate people for what they actually say and do rather than their identity. And understand that most of the people you've ever met in your life have never had a single thought in their head. They've had feelings which they've confused for thoughts, but they've never actually thought anything - and then they use those misinformed, petty and jealous feelings to vote their nonsensical desires into law. They follow the leader and avoid confrontation at all costs, then when hardship finds them they say \"why me\". At least in my case, understanding that most people behave like animals rather than as sophisticated people (myself included) was a game changer, and I could stop worrying about manufactured politics and scaremongering, and just live my life as I saw fit.",
