            "body": "There seems to be two different but related topics here that keep getting conflated: the Social Security tax and the system itself. \n\nThe Social Security tax is capped as up to $176,500 of earnings can be subject to the tax. So a school principal earning $176.5k and Elon Musk both pay the same in SS tax. Whether you agree with this is of course up for debate, but it\u2019s odd (to say the least) that this is so vastly different from Medicare tax which has no cap. Both are Socialist programs intended to use the government to create a market that would not exist otherwise, which brings us to the programs themselves. \n\n Social security and Medicare were both created as ways got the government to fill the voids that the free market would not fill. Old people can\u2019t work, so Social Security provides a base income that they could not get anymore because they are too old to work. Medicare is the same premise. The free market would not insure old people. Too many claims and not enough profit. I am not saying this is right. I am simply explaining these programs\u2019 existence. \n\nFinally the argument of \u201cwell if the money were invested I could have 10x!\u201d There is inherently hindsight bias here for sure, but also this misses the point of the SS program - the $ needs to be there to pay out to people every single month no matter what.  Putting these funds into the market would add risk. In addition, it goes against Libertarian principles as it would allow the government to pick winners and losers by deciding to invest here versus there. Why should the government decide that my SS tax go to Meta or Google? That sort of thing.  \n\nAny who - just more of a top line here. Not getting into personal feelings on the matter but felt these needed to be parsed a bit.",

A much closer analogy is a mandatory insurance policy with a terrible payout and a cash out value of zero. \n\n>Of course...it was ruined by being government-run. \n\n\nIt wasn't ruined by government.

But that surplus was miniscule compared to benefits that must be paid out anyways. Even if the surplus was never touched, it wouldn't have moved the needle much. Some basic math is enough to figure that out. A few billion here and there is nothing. Fuck... we gave that same amount of money to Ukraine. \n\nJust like insurance: current contributions pay for current beneficiaries. Unlike insurance though, this mandatory retirement insurance policy is just a population based ponzi scheme. Current retirees receive MORE in benefits than they contributed which means that the only way to keep the system going is to have forever increasing population growth. That's just basic math.",

                            "body": "When people talk about \"social security is a ponzi scheme\"...  They are more right then wrong. \n\nThis is true for all social welfare programs.\n\nAll of it depends on having more workers paying into the system then people who receive benefits.  They all have this same problem.  \n\nRemember:   Everything is paid for by working people.  And by \"Working people\" I mean people who actually make things and contribute economically to society.\n\nWhich means that this excludes all government workers, government contractors, and any business or individual that makes more from taxes then they pay in.  These people are all dependents.  Just as much as anybody else on welfare. \n\n---------------------------\n\nSo working people generate the material goods and value that goes into society. They have to pay taxes so that a percentage of the goods/value/etc they create is taken away from them. \n\nThis goes to pay for all the roads, tanks, bombs, police.  They pay for all the illegal drugs, and also pay for the war on drugs.  They pay 100% the cost of all those things.  They pay 100% for all medical services, pay 100% of all the food, the housing, etc etc.  \n\n-------------------------\n\nSo when you have welfare schemes like Social Security it is a ponzi scheme.\n\nIt can only possibly work when you have a whole lot of people paying into it and a very small percentage of people pulling from it. \n\nAnd despite all the apologetic around Social Security...  It was designed for with the expectation that the majority of people are going to be dead, or only having a few years left to live, when they hit \"retirement\". \n\nAll these social programs are designed with a set of assumptions that was only true for a short time. \n\nAs society modernizes and becomes more wealthy birth rates drop.  \n\nSocial security was designed in a era were having children had a economic purpose for the family. People had kids because they needed them.  Needed them for the farm, needed them to work, etc. \n\nThis is true for all poor societies. \n\nHowever it is not true for rich ones.   As people become wealthier having children is a life style choice.  They have children because they want to have children, not because they need to have children. \n\nWhich means that the population pyramid that social programs depend on... far more working young people then reitired old people...  is reversed. \n\nThere is a \"bubble\" of old people that are getting older without a correspondingly large young population to replace and pay for them. \n\n\nThis is why country Governments in EU are in a panic mode and doing everything they can to encourage immigration into their country. \n\nTheir societies are not sustainable. They are designed using the mentality of people born in the 1800s serving as politicians in the 1950s.  Society did not progress in ways they anticipated. \n\nSo they are desperate to maintain a glut of working class by importing people massively. \n\nBut it is isn't working.  It isn't going to work or get better either. \n\nThey have destroyed economic growth to have the type of society they want. But they need the economic growth that they gave up in order to pay for it.",
