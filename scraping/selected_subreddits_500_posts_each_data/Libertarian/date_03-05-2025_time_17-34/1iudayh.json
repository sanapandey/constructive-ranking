The cool part is the government's annual spending is many, many times Elon's net worth, **so there is** absolutely enough headroom to become solvent if you make enough cuts. \n\nIt's true you aren't going to pay off 35 trillion at once but our budget is $6.3Tr and our annual deficit is $1.7Tr.  With a 27% cut we eliminate the annual deficit. So where are you getting this idea that it's impossible to make enough cuts to become solvent on an annual basis and start chipping away at the debt?",
