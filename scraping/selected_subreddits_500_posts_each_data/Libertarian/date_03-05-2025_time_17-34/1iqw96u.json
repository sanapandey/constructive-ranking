    "selftext": "Watching the Sunday morning shows (first mistake) and I'm struck by how they have pounced on stories about a few people in the federal government that \"may\" lose their job. The framing makes every job sound essential AND can only be done by the federal government. \n\nMissing from these stories is any talk of the value of privatization, the size/scope/role of the government, or its utter lack of efficiency. \n\nAt one point they mentioned that \"hundreds of thousands\" of recently hired federal works are at risk. I wish listeners would pause and think on that for a moment. Those are your tax dollars!\n\nSo any, that's all - looking forward to hearing from certain friends about that one park ranger losing his job in Utah...",

            "body": "The cherry picking is annoying for the one off jobs but the NNSA thing wasn't cherry picking. The DoE was momentarily forced to fire 400 probationary employees at NNSA.  Just because those folks are probationary doesn't mean they were doing nothing (i know a couple radiological control technicians there). If there is a lapse in manning then there is a lapse in upkeep of ordinance and source/fuel control.....that is bad.\n\nA lot of jobs should be privatized or moved to the state level in my eyes. States can manage their public lands, states can manage their schools, and a private company can maintain utilities. However I think there is a place for the control of nuclear weapon maintenance and fuel security being performed by the federal gov. The separation of nuclear control between the military and federal civil government is critical and is why the DoE/NNSA handles this stuff (it's laid out in law).",

Nobody is looking to impose needless suffering on anyone else. \n\nBut that doesn't mean that therefore every government employee deserves his or her sinecure. The federal government is obviously a bloated, inefficient mess. There are gonna be tons of people in useless jobs who are part of a useless bureaucracy and our taxes are being used to support them. The fact that I, as a human being, don't want something bad to happen to some poor \"mine inspector\" doesn't mean that therefore he is entitled to his job at our expense.",

Figuratively, or literally. As long as your negative actions cease, I care not how. \n\nGovernment corruption has shielded so many from reality. \n\nAvoiding and/or denying reality will not alter it. \n\nIn a society that isn't coddled by corrupt government, people who reject reality stop right away or cease to exist. \n\nThis is as it should be. \n\nI will not mourn or pity any worthless people who are discarded. Instead, I will celebrate. \n\nBetween modern medicine and the welfare state there are millions of people who should not exist. \n\nWe need to allow natural selection to take place. \n\nNature and the free market will do that. \n\nDon't get upset at the cleaning of house. Get upset at the people who corrupted it in the first place and those who perpetuate and thrive off of said corruption, and are desperately trying to defend their corrupt system. \n\n\n\n\nSo many people live in a fantasy world that is built upon denying truth and reality. They get very defensive and hostile when you show them the folly of their ways and beliefs. Others simply lack the mental fortitude to accept how bad reality is, so they go into denial as a physiological defense mechanism. \n\nThen there are the millions-billions of bots controlled by the corruption. TIME magazine stated that more than 50% of all internet traffic is bots. \n\nThey will attempt to continue the corruption by further denial and obfuscation of reality. \n\nAnyone defending the corruption or the body politics that facilitate(d) the corruption is in on it, in one way or another. That, or they are so deeply indoctrinated into the vast system of corruption they are unable to admit reality. \n\nNone of them are worth any time or consideration. They should be ignored and rejected outright. \n\nGood fucking riddance.",
