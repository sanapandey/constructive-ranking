    "selftext": "I'm told I'm Progressive, but I hold to several values and principles of Republicans. I just say I'm a Moderate now. But given all the great political affiliation on the grid, what do you think I am really?\n\n- I believe in an organized, democratic, and representative Government. 3 branches. Separation but a balance of powers. A balance of powers shared between The Federal & The States.\n\n- The Federal Government should have more power over the military, international trade, diplomacy. Anything that affects the nation as a whole.\n\n- States Rights must not contradict anything in the Federal Constitution & its Amendments, but have liberty to make laws in terms of how their cities and towns are governed, and on social issues. \n\n- A limited but balanced government. Large enough to meet the basic needs of its citizens. Not too big not too small.\n\n- Equal opportunity to political parties than just a 2-party system. Limitations to how much focus and money can be given to a candidate or a party.\n\n- Any services the government offers should be related to an essential need or a need that benefits the population to create a more better, safer, healthier society (in terms of education, healthcare, job security, welfare, retirement, and the like).\n\n- So long as people are peaceful and civil, every capital and town hall should have a 24/7 designated zone where its citizens can protest and petition its government.\n\n- People have the right to bear arms. But those who've been engaged in serious crimes should not have them. Strong background checks.\n\n- A conservative fiscal policy. Taxes should only be for the essential services or to pay time for our representatives representing the people.\n\n- A strong high quality public K-12 educational system that is free, accessible to all regardless of where they live, high quality, focused on job readiness, offering programs for job skills, and where teachers make at least over 60K/yr. A better payed and educated society produces a better society.\n\n- Education should not be politically affiliated and should be about education and not pushing a social ideology.\n\n- Parents should reserve the right on how their children are educated.\n\n- Universal Healthcare. A healthier society produces a better society.\n\n- Its not the governments job to be actively involved in shaping the economy. But, there should be some regulation and laws for ethical standards and to prevent monopolies from forming.\n\n- The government should help to mobilize business' for discussions about investment and job creation opportunities, but should not be the final decision maker in determining its outcome.\n\n- The economy should be based on the principles of an ethical form of Capitalism. Self-governing under those rules. Business' have rights but they must not discriminate.\n\n- The government should have some funds to help in the creation of new business'.\n\n\n- A regulated, well-trained, accountable, diverse police force. Codified ethical standards. One that is focused on prevention and deterration of crime. Involved in the community. Other kinds of policing with certain powers including volunteer and neighborhood policing. Practical neighborhood watch programs that are constitutional.\n\n- A strong, ethical, diverse, non-political military. Involved in civilian life during times of peace. Upholding our traditions. War should only be for imminent attacks or declaration of war upon us.\n\n- Our allies are those that believe in our constitutional principles.\n\n- We should only give money or assistance to allies if its necessary.\n\n- We engage in trade only of there's a benefit for us.\n\n- A strong manufacturing industry.\n\n- Trade and economic policies that create jobs here, and allow us to export more goods.\n\n\nIn summary, my political philosophy is really about a representative and constitutional democracy. All about balance and separation of powers, and enduring freedoms exist within Law. Less government and less spending. An educated, working, equal, safer and healthier society",

I'd be willing to work with a pretty wide range of ideologies, so long as their goals and mine align or can at least tolerate each other.  A couple (poor) examples would be like siding with Republicans on tariffs if it meant the end of income tax, or siding with Democrats on de-criminalization of drugs and the end of the war on drugs.  The clashing point would probably be on the economic side, with both major parties wanting to heavily regulate the economy as a whole as well as invoke social programs that involve redistribution of wealth.",

I hate the state but recognize the necessary evil of having state courts, police/fire, basic military protection. So there are different flavors. But being a libertarian requires you to start with the premise that government is inherently evil. You seem to believe it can be a force for good. \n\nPost three good things the US government has done in the last 35 years - since the end of the Cold War.
