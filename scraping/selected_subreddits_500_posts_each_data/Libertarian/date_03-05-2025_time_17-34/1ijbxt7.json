Mark Cuban is tweeting about his concern that Elon is appealing to libertarian values as a smokescreen to cover for his real plan, but most libertarians seem to be celebrating with little doubt (besides Gaza, I know you all have been critical of that). It's not crazy to think one of Mark's billionaire buddies tipped him that something really bad is going down.\n\nI understand celebrating defunding things like US AID, it's a complete waste of billions of dollars. But one man has access to pretty much all of your personal data, may be able to alter it, and has little oversight. He may be training an AI model to help him identify corporate opponents right now, it's naive to think Elon's doing public service out of the goodness of his heart (not that I know what he's doing instead). He may be able to delete you from the earth entirely, the fed intelligence agencies are fucking evil as hell but I don't think they would ever have a reason to do that. I'm just curious what it would take for you all to oppose Elon entirely? The NSA is already bad enough, for all we know, Musk could be building the super omega NSA on a private server. There's plenty of ways to turn that into infinite money.\n\nIf the dude that was doing this had ties with the FBI instead of the tech sphere, this would almost certainly cause a huge stir here. So why isn't it? Are the mods compromises?",

It's unlikely they could even copy it all in that timeframe, let alone analyze. \n\nSo the more likely scenario is that they're granting themselves access, setting up some form of backdoor so they can siphon off data at their hearts discretion. \n\nI'm more than a little skeptical that without any other systems knowledge or training they got access and were able to correctly determine where money was going and what it was being used for. \n\nLet's look back a few years to Musk buying Twitter and the 'genius' that he was claiming he was going to optimize all the code and improve everything. Realistically he ruined the platform and then turned it into a cesspool. \n\nThese guys are complete charlatans, and allowing them and a group of twenty-somethings access to the most prized data in our country thinking they only have altruistic interests at heart is beyond naive. \n\nI don't know the correct answer to appropriately sizing our government, but this feels literally like a fox in the henhouse.",

So I get somewhat frustrated when I see conservative talking points on this forum, it's not what I was introduced to 10+ years ago. I think the culture war shit has been effective in turning a lot of young libertarians into conservatives who like drugs, and that sucks because I think there's good ideas to be found in the ideology.

I can see the libertarian argument for voting either way in the past election for people who aren't infected with conservative culture war bullshit.\n\nIf Elon's operating on his moral compass, why has he been lying about what he's been up to with his DOGE kids? As someone with a pretty good understanding of coding (I've worked on VST plugins before, I'm sure these kids know more than me, though), I don't see why he would possibly need write access to the Treasury if he was performing an audit. He wouldn't really need to access many top secret databases at all if he was just trying to reduce government waste. And he *definitely* would not need to be adding new code to the databases he's been accessing if that were the case. Being transparent and going through the typical channels would have reduced this entire controversy by 90%, and I think Elon is smart enough to know that. So why didn't he? Democrats would've bitched over US AID no matter what, fed workers would have been mad no matter what, but there definitely wouldn't be people worried about a coup if he had done that. Instead, he's doing everything as fast as humanly possible, and making mistakes as a result. If the goal was only to reduce government spending, the best way would be to lay concrete groundwork over the course of Trump's first two years to make sure everything sticks when it's challenged by courts. Instead, they're trying to outrun the courts. I'm open to hearing an alternate explanation that makes sense, but I've scoured the internet for one and haven't found it. I would be thrilled if I was wrong about this and it was all blind panic, but given fascist/monarchist Curtis Yarvin's (I'm not labeling him that, he's called himself that) influence on how this entire admin has  operated, I'm extremely skeptical this is just about downsizing government a bit.",

If I was being tweeted at a million times a minute by people who wished I was dead, I don't think I could handle it. So I'm not claiming to be above him when I say that I think a large part of his motivation is to defeat (in whatever form he envisions) his perceived enemies. Him \"winning\" could mean anything from making more money to becoming dictator of the universe, but he does seem to have a need to be viewed as some sort of genius. His public image went from real-life Iron Man to weird asshole in like five years, it's human to feel slighted by that. Not that he should be forgiven if he does have some secret scheme planned, but it makes some sense. History is full of people who had *nearly* all the power and money, but they could only focus on the 'nearly' part. Your brain will always adjust to your new reality no matter how extravagant it is, it's just how we're wired.",
