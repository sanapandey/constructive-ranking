No offense to you, but every flight mechanic I've talked to (mostly apaches and other helis, guess the branch) says the same shit about how the airframe that they work on is the biggest POS, yet in cases like the apache and a10 they are the biggest force multiplier in a CAS scenario. I worked on the side where memorizing the minute details of effectiveness was more important than how the engine bay looked. Each jobs equally important in the grand scheme, though.\n\nWhile the f22 is the best dogfighter we have statistically for better or worse, it sucks at CAS. The f35 is great at it and is more of a replacement for the F/A18 and should really have that \"A\" designation as well. And it can carrier launch with the f22 also lacks the ability to. In the grand scheme though I guess you are right because \"ultimate\" effectiveness would be for us to only field MQ aircraft and ISR, but from experience people told cleared hot without an emotional stake in the game ie from the cockpit, make far more mistakes",
