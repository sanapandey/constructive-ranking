    "selftext": "Backs Ground: I was having a debate with my friends, I said that a private charity is better then the government giving things to people. They replied that I\u2019m heartless and that the homeless will somehow starve. When I brought up Argentina they just kept saying that everyone poor is dead and that I need to seek therapy. Next the tried to bring up public works  like school and roads and I said they should be private again as the government Is inefficient. They kept saying that people won\u2019t get anywhere and bring up the whole will build the roads argument and good education won\u2019t exist without the government. How do I counter those arguments. Just in case you\u2019re wondering I am not a person that debates often but I have been a libertarian for close to a year now. ",

Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality.

The answer is private companies, not the government. The question is who will fund the roads. Roads are very important to individuals and businesses so there would be plenty of voluntary funding to be had. \n\nIf they say \u201cgood education won\u2019t exist without the government\u201d, ask them what would be the best education. The answer has always been private schools. Yes, they cost money, but the cost of public education is massive.
