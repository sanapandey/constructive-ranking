Because they always have to concede that part of them **wants government to do something**.\n\nAnCaps philosophically oppose all forms of government and, I think, better understand the consequences of government action.\n\nJon (unintentionally) demonstrated this point.",

I just *hate* whatever it is either of these fools \"stand\" for. Nick wants the mildest something something else and Jon obviously just wants an excuse to troll the concept of individual rights or anyone who even thinks of defending them.\n\nIt took me decades of study and (actual) debate to get where I am today. This can *not* properly be considered a debate. There is barely an *argument*, from either side.",

It took me a lot of time to go from \"directional\" libertarian, to minarchist, to ancap and I still hold most \"ancap\" positions as these are not only perfectly compatible with but in fact came from Ayn Rand originally. The issue I have with ancapism is the actual lack of legal integration, which in practice means not \"competition in law\" but \"lawfare\" and hence warfare.\n\n\nThe disagreement is far more technical and also far more fundamentally important than anarchists make it out to be. It's not the typical \"but there will be chaos\" or \"thugs will rule the streets\" position, and yet it does lead to that conclusion if there is not ultimately integration. Such integration is government, yet it is valid qua \"private law\" as ancaps call it. There is no initiation of force, yet there is a legal constant all the same.\u00a0",
