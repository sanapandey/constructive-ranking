I do believe with serious, scientific reasons the worst kind of movie that you have probably seen\u2014worst from the Indian viewpoint\u2014as to what they did to the white man.\n\n>I do not think that they have any right to live in a country merely because they were born here and acted and lived like savages. Americans didn\u2019t conquer; Americans did not conquer that country.\n\n>Whoever is making sounds there, I think is hissing, he is right, but please be consistent: you are a racist if you object to that \\[laughter and applause\\]. You are that because you believe that anything can be given to Man by his biological birth or for biological reasons.\n\n>If you are born in a magnificent country which you don\u2019t know what to do with, you believe that it is a property right; it is not. And, since the Indians did not have any property rights\u2014they didn\u2019t have the concept of property; they didn\u2019t even have a settled, society, they were predominantly nomadic tribes; they were a primitive tribal culture, if you want to call it that\u2014if so, they didn\u2019t have any rights to the land, and there was no reason for anyone to grant them rights which they had not conceived and were not using.\n\n>It would be wrong to attack any country which does respect\u2014or try, for that matter, to respect\u2014individual rights, because if they do, you are an aggressor and you are morally wrong to attack them. But if a country does not protect rights\u2014if a given tribe is the slave of its own tribal chief\u2014why should you respect the rights they do not have?\n\n>Or any country which has a dictatorship. Government\u2014the citizens still have individual rights\u2014but the country does not have any rights. Anyone has the right to invade it, because rights are not recognized in this country and neither you nor a country nor anyone can have your cake and eat it too.\n\n>In other words, want respect for the rights of Indians, who, incidentally, for most cases of their tribal history, made agreements with the white man, and then when they had used up whichever they got through agreement of giving, selling certain territory, then came back and broke the agreement, and attacked white settlements.\n\n>I will go further. Let\u2019s suppose they were all beautifully innocent savages, which they certainly were not. What was it that they were fighting for, if they opposed white men on this continent? For their wish to continue a primitive existence, their right to keep part of the earth untouched, unused, and not even as property, but just keep everybody out so that you will live practically like an animal, or maybe a few caves about.\n\n>Any white person who brings the elements of civilization had the right to take over this continent, and it is great that some people did, and discovered here what they couldn\u2019t do anywhere else in the world and what the Indians, if there are any racist Indians today, do not believe to this day: respect for individual rights.\n\n[\\-Ayn Rand](https://analepsis.org/2017/09/05/ayn-rand-and-the-savages-455/)",
