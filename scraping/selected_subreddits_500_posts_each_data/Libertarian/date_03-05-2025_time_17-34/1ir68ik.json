Suspicion will be the only thing voters will see. \n\nThe huge imbalance that the legislative branch has allowed brought us here. Musk and Trump's executive power are the result of many things from the lack of executive checks and balances. Drone wars, never actually declaring war and allowing the president to unilaterally go to war.\n\nNever making any real legislative moves to curtail spending, and glaring issues with Citizen's United that have resulted in Musk and DOGE. All issues Congress could have solved themselves. \n\nIntentional or not, he's forcing their hand to do what he's trying to do, and that's limit the power of the government, Particularly the executive branch. They have a decision: Doge or be Doged.",
