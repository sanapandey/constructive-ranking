And the courts upheld this decision.\n\nLike right now, even just by me saying this, if I pissed off the wrong person in the federal government, I could legally be tracked down and thrown in Guantanamo Bay indefinitely without any sort of warrant or due process to have a court date, if someone with DHS were to decide what I'm sharing here constituted some kind of threat to National Security.\n\nIt's crazy but that was the day that the United States \"officially\" forever changed from the country that was openly proclaimed to be the \"land of the free\", to a country that shamelessly reserves the authority to do as they please to any citizen that a single government official deems to be some sort of \"threat\", without any sort of warrants or due process required to do so.\n\nSure, we don't hear much about the people that this has happened to. We probably never will, as there is no legal requirement for this to be disclosed publicly if they determine someone to be a threat.\n\nThe legislation (\"Patriot Act\") made it through congress, signed into law by the president with no objections raised by the courts because of the events that transpired that fateful day.",

The theme seems to be that individuals have rights, except for when \"National Security\" is at risk, then all bets are off.\n\nThe really interesting part is that DHS (which also comprises of ICE/CBP/USBP/FEMA + many more) operate completely independently from the DOJ & DOD, sort of like a orwellian militarized police force.\n\nThe scope of their authority is rather vague and while as federal agents who often work in tandem task forces with the DOJ, the upper levels of their power structure operate completely 100% independently from the DOJ, and only directly respond to the president, congress & SCOTUS. \n\nThey are the only ones with authority to go after them for civil rights violations, warrantless searches & seizures, and SCOTUS has ruled many times saying they may basically do as they please when it comes to protecting \"national security\" (based on what they determine to be a threat and what the appropriate response may be).\n\nDHS doesn't exactly have a great record when it comes to respecting the rights of US citizens. Just google \"DHS human rights\" or \"DHS checkpoints\" and you will find thousands of examples they violated peoples rights and nobody was ever held accountable for it. \n\nThey are the one branch of federal government that SCOTUS has basically given \"qualified immunity\" for everything when it comes to search warrants and illegal detentions and whatnot. And they were created as a direct result of 9/11/01",

It itself is not executing these cuts - to my knowledge.

Trump had no authority, to begin with, to ban bump stocks unilaterally for private citizens, that would require an act of congress, but the ATF expanded the definition of 'machine guns,' which was banned by congress, to include bump stocks so that they could enforce it on private citizens. I chose the ATF because they are notorious for overreaching.\n\nThe ATF from the IRS is something I didn't know about and is somehow hilarious to me. \n\n>Those hired and appointed within congressionally created agencies have to go through proper security and background clearance as needed.\n\nI'm not familiar, is this a convention or by law?

I'll add my reasonable take for you discerning individuals. \n\nYes, it seems the Republicrats feel very self righteous in their abuse of power and constitutionally questionable policies during covid, but are overreacting and exaggerating when it comes to legal action the executive branch has a right to wield.\n\nI'm no legal scholar but I bet most of us here do want the majority of federal institutions dismantled. Much of this work that's actually legitimate can be delegated to the states. I don't know how much of that trump can actually do and if there's any glimmer of truth to this bandwagon trotting on about how what musk is doing isn't legal. But im ready to see how much they can manage to do before the republicrat opposition gets too great",
