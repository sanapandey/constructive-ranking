I think private education has several advantages and is overall better than public education, but there is almost no correlation between how entertaining or good a teacher is and how much they are paid.",

There, research skills are valued over teaching skills, so good researchers definitely get paid more. There are also liberal arts schools who value teaching and do pay good teachers more.\n\nSo why doesn't the K-12 match the pay with the performance?",

                            "body": "Performance has some impact on salary, but no more than the public sector. Much like public schools, teachers are paid overwhelmingly based on experience and certification. Raises are usually calculated in a range based on a range of performance factors, but even in private education it's quite common for fixed percentage raises, or for the range of raises being so small that it's largely irrelevant and squeezing out that last 1 or 2 percentage point raises often has nothing to do with classroom observations, but rather how many committees you're on.\n\nBeyond my direct experience, I have met hundreds upon hundreds of teachers. I have literally never heard of a school where a teacher who is loved by students, or has excellent results on standardized testing, is paid significantly more than a similarly credentialed and experienced teacher, particularly in Korea where there's more deference to credentials and age than the West. The idea of star teachers being paid like star athletes does not happen.\n\nIn this video, they are talking about the private cram system (hagwons) in South Korea. So in that system, my students were never asked to survey their teachers. Pay raises were static. Salary offers and working hours were almost exact the same from company to company, down to how even contracts were worded. Keep in mind, I was working for one of the top 2 companies in that field at the time, and later for a mid-level company.\n\nThe irony is that the example Stossel gives is of tutors that make money by selling access to their website or through their media contract. We already have that in the West. The authors of Freakanomics made themselves incredibly wealthy. Test cramming, by far the biggest money spinner for tutors, only exists because of the rigid, top-down demands of the Korean government. In fact, the artificial propping of state run exams is a major drag on the South Korean economy and even the health of its youth. The idea that we can look at this system and see an example of Libertarianism in practice is absurd. South Korea's approach to education should exist as a warning on what to avoid.",
