            "body": "If you think that the government doesn\u2019t do anything important, then you have never worked with the government. I\u2019m in tech consulting and I\u2019ve worked on commercial projects as well as public projects. On a commercial project, some people might lose some money and will eventually be compensated for it if something gets fucked up. On a public project, people can literally die if something gets fucked up. The perceived \u201cinefficiency\u201d of the government is due to the fact that the government focuses on social issues which are typically much more complex and difficult to resolve than what commercial entities are willing to take on. You also have to have a lot of regulations when you try to address social problems because a mistake can quickly result in someone\u2019s death. \n\nFor example, I worked on some software that is used to manage prisons. I saw a bug one time where an inmate\u2019s record got duplicated somehow. If I didn\u2019t catch that and it made it into production, then you could end up with one record for an inmate that shows that they got into a fight with another inmate and another record for the same inmate that doesn\u2019t have the record of that incident. That\u2019s a pretty big deal because if the person assigning the inmate to a cell looks at the wrong record, they can wind up assigning them to the cell that the guy that they just fought is currently assigned to. That\u2019s a good way to get an inmate killed. This is just one example of why comparing private entities to the government is idiotic. There really aren\u2019t any scenarios on any commercial project I\u2019ve been on where the consequences of a bug are nearly as dire. It\u2019s why a lot of government processes require a ton of reviews and sign offs. \n\nAnother big difference between commercial and public projects is funding. Anyone claiming that the government just throws away/wastes money has no idea how the government actually works. Government agencies are massive penny pinchers. It\u2019s to the point where consulting agencies typically won\u2019t try to win work with them unless it\u2019s a package deal. We try to get multiple projects with the same agency at once because the profit margins on a single public project often aren\u2019t worth the hassle. They will try to find any angle to get us to give them work for free. The people who move up to management positions in these agencies are the people who are really good at making the funding that they have go as far as possible. There\u2019s always a game that clients like to play where they claim that they asked us to build a certain feature/functionality into the app that they never asked for, but the government does this to a degree that I never see on commercial projects. I\u2019ve been on a project where the client expanded the scope of the project so much that the company that I worked for wound up paying for the development of their software for two years. The reason the government is like this is because the project can be defunded next year. They know that they have the funding now, so they have to make it go as far as possible before it gets cut off. Corporations will just throw money at us so that we can tell them what they\u2019re doing wrong and they can ignore us until the issue pops up again. Commercial projects are much more likely to be ones where I end up wondering why the company is spending money on us.",

If you think that government was the only choice, the most likely reason is that you've not applied your creativity to come up with a way to do it without government. If you think government was the best way to accomplish it, the most likely reason is that you've not applied your creativity to find a way that doesn't requiring stealing other people's money to accomplish the goal.\n\nEven your example of finding a duplicated record for a prisoner, _happened in government data_. Government didn't do anything better than anyone else in that example. You just happened to have found the problem early enough. The fact that you haven't personally worked on any commercial project with similarly dire stakes isn't evidence that such companies don't exist. SpaceX for example would get people killed if their manned rockets blew up. Banks could get people killed if they made a mistake with money in accounts. There's nothing special about government that eliminates these kinds of risks in software. \n\n>Another big difference between commercial and public projects is funding.

Government agencies are massive penny pinchers. \n\nROFL  I'm sure that within a given department at a given agency, they're often pinching pennies on their assigned budgets because they're trying to fit all their salaries into it. But the waste comes from the fact that their department exists in the first place. The waste comes from their inflated salaries and associated state retirement plans. The waste comes from putting in tons of effort to accomplish something that almost no one wanted in the first place given the costs of accomplishing it. Government waste is often like someone building an extravagant mansion and then hiring illegal immigrants to clean it. You don't get credit for pinching pennies if you're fumbling Benjamins.",

The reason government takes on these issues is because they cost money and there isn\u2019t an easy way to profit off of it or adding a profit-motive would result in worse outcomes. \u201cWhy not just have charities do it?\u201d Well, we\u2019ve tried having charities take on these issues and they just aren\u2019t as effective as government programs. These programs and their corresponding taxes to fund them exist because individuals living in a democratic republic voted for representatives who then passed laws to create the programs and to fund them. That\u2019s how democratic republics work. We as a society vote and people decided that they wanted someone in office who would create and fund these programs. So, you do actually have a say in how money is spent by the government. The issue you seem to have with that is the fact that other people also have a say and they might not agree with you. Want a program defunded? Then convince your friends to vote for someone who will defund it. \n\nLol, the issue I found was a result of testing. It wasn\u2019t a result of government data. I created the data to check to see if I could cause the issue. That\u2019s how we find issues before we release software to the public. This is how every software project works. All software has a bunch of bugs before it gets released. Also, it was a developer working for a private entity who developed the code that had the bug in it. SpaceX benefits from government subsidies. There are tons of government regulations that they have to abide by to develop their rockets. Their projects involve a ton of government oversight and they basically partner with the government for their projects. Government projects are actually set up so that there\u2019s more oversight over quality. So they are actually set up in a way that makes it more likely for issues to get caught early. Lol, you think that people in the government make good salaries. People don\u2019t go into public service for the money, that\u2019s for sure. They all could be making a lot more money in private industry with the same skill set. Their departments exist because people for it. People definitely asked for them to exist because they voted representatives into office who ran on funding or creating those departments. Thankfully, the government insures bank deposits so that people don\u2019t die if a bank has issues. Even in the banking scenario, it would take a failure of government for anyone to actually die.",

Oftentimes, a mindless meme is enough to spark a decent debate or conversation.

All they have done is expand government for the last 100 years. Never before has anything like this been done. It's flawed, often times ugly, and Elon is often an asshole. I don't care. It is more than we have ever had. If they are going to give the people back a portion of the money they stole from them, then I'm ok with that. If they spend the money on other crap l, I'm not OK with that. \n\nYou don't have to like Elon or believe this is going to be some golden age to at least acknowledge that more is being done now than ever. I don't believe most of the people on here complaining about it are libertarians though.

There are no more incidents than in years past, it's just being talked about so everyone is paying attention and they feel like it's a bigger deal than it actually is.\n\nI don't think our system is completely broken and needs to be burned to the ground. A lot of it works and should be appropriately given merit and used as a template where needed. What DOGE is currently doing is ineffective and will create more waste. I will continue to believe that until we get some real transparency on the cuts being made and the selection process.\n\nAnd I actually do care if they spend the money on other stuff. I want less government, not the same amount with just a different face. And if they are going to spend it, I want it going to fellow, hard working, middle and low class Americans who are the backbone of this country - not billionaires and wars and other countries.\n\nAs for the prevalence of libertarians vs. liberals on this sub? Who is to say. I've seen quite a bit of conservative ideals and trump worshipping here, too. I don't think one downvoted comment is an adequate measure.",
