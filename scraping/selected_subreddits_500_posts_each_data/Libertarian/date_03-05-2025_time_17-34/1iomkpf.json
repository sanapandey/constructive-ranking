                    "body": "Thank you so much for your precious comment. I apologize for not replying earlier. I wanted to take enough time to consider a proper response, one that is thoughtful and respectful of your position as a Libertarian.\n\nTo help you understand where I'm coming from I need to disclose where my core philosophical and political  positions lie. I am a classically trained economist in the modern liberal tradition. As such, I have certain underpinnings of Keynes and the later neoclassical synthesis school within me. However, this foundation sits on top of classical economics(Adam Smith, Milton Friedman), not as an alternative to it. I believe in the primacy of the free market; it's ability to provide the greatest utilitarian value to society, it's benefits in driving innovation through freedom, and most importantly doing so in the most efficient way possible.\n\nI am a Libertarian first, then something else second. Primacy of 'free markets' is of utmost importance. The government, or any other entity should step in only in times of necessity; in times of war, in times of great social upheaval, in times when 'free' in 'free market' has collapsed. Then it should step away to let the 'free market' do its thing.\n\nSo in a sense, my larger 'Framework' is to me a Libertarian framework. UBI (or Universal Healthcare etc.), while it does seem to function as a black pill in modern discourse (i.e. a politically charged word), does not stem from a 'Liberal' view, but rather from a deeply Libertarian one. I believe a 'free market' is best only when 'free' is possible and true. When a majority of the population lives in poverty, wealth and production resources are controlled by an oligarchy, and advancements in technology is poised to push a significant portion of the population into a perpetual state of social meaninglessness (Globalism, advances in AI and Automation). I believe this is a text book definition of a 'free market' that has lost its ability to remain 'free'.\n\nIn that sense UBI and the other 'liberal-leaning' policies I present are not because I have a bleeding heart, nor is it because I don't believe in the 'free market', but it's because I do believe in it, that returning the 'free market' to a 'free' state is unfortunately our only choice. It is not a choice that is desired, but a choice that is inevitable.'.\n\nThe 'free market' will always result in the most optimal result. But for those living today, the time the free market requires to reach this optimal state may not be feasible. Society could collapse before the free market has a chance to reach optimum. I propose a stop gap solution to give the free market time.\n\nThank you for reading this rather long response and I look forward to further conversations.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful day.\n\n\n\n/Umverm\u00f6gen",

No society can survive such chaos. In the next generation, we will see up to 30% of the current work force threatened by frontier technologies, jobs that are out of the reach of vast portions of the population. UBI is meant for that.\n\nThe core of my Framework is about harnessing the power of the market so that private enterprise can accel in what they do best; innovate. But frontier technology (like AI and Automation) needs to be harnessed by ethics. It will inevitably change the world that we know and cause mass societal upheaval in the process if we are not careful.\n\nI've spent the bulk of my career developing and implementing AI and Automation. And I am truly scared of what lies before it, if we humans are not careful.",
