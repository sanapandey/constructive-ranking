Then the next mob shouts down the last mob and centralizes more power.  Now approximately 250 years later the mobs have centralized enough power again to be a real problem.  Next comes a return to monarchy because a mob drinks the kook aid enough to sack all opposition and install the first actual tyrant.  It won\u2019t be called a monarchy of course, it\u2019s after all just for public safety. And the good of the people.  Could be trump.  Could be Vance in 4 years.  Could be a 2028 charismatic Dem.  Could be twenty years from now or a hundred.  Piling more and more government centralized power until it topples is the history of civilization in full since the first person was able to rise above surviving the day at a subsistence level and scheme to acquire even more.",

I just checked again, I don\u2019t see anything about DOGE or the executive creating a new department of memecoin bros to do whatever they want however they want.\n\nClause 12 states Congress cannot authorize military funding for a term of longer than two years.  Since they pass new funding in a period shorter than that, they haven\u2019t violated the clause, though there is an argument the spirit is violated.  But if we care about the spirit of the law as well as the technicality of a law, we certainly couldn\u2019t justify Doge at all.  Cute.\n\nFurther: The OMB directive to freeze nearly $3 trillion in appropriations, with only 24 hours\u2019 notice, bypassed congressional authorization and caused widespread chaos. This move constitutes impoundment, which is typically unconstitutional unless Congress has explicitly granted such authority to the executive branch. (Hmm, did they?  Why not?) The courts quickly intervened, with a D.C. court preparing to issue an injunction before the administration rescinded the memo.\n\nMaybe they knew it was illegal in the first place.  Again, cute.\n\nThe Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed following similar confrontations with President Nixon, clarifying that the President can only withhold funds for limited reasons and with congressional approval. Despite this precedent, some members of Trump\u2019s inner circle argued that the Act itself is unconstitutional and sought to revive broader impoundment powers.\n\nCan the President pick a single citizen and remove their social security payments? Can DOGE? Right now, grants have been awarded with clear terms that have been signed, NIH is sending out instructions now that these contracts are being changed retroactively, and legally they believe they can be reimbursed for past payments that don\u2019t meet the new terms they\u2019ve just unilaterally created (though they won\u2019t pursue that path today.). Not sure who just sent that out.  Doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine because they did it.\n\nIn short, the rules might just be whatever the hell you feel like, and breaking massive systems might not matter.  Hell, why do global depressions and chaotic markets matter? Why bother with contracts? Why value stability? \n\nIf you really think about it, everything is stupid and it\u2019s all relative.  I\u2019ll just go make up some shit I think is cool and try it out on the treasury, and get some rando to say it\u2019s legal.  Certainly the courts shouldn\u2019t have a say in contract or constitutional law. Hopefully the system will fuck up, money will stop flowing, the markets will collapse, mass unemployment will follow, cycling in on itself, and because we\u2019ve dissolved everything we won\u2019t do anything about it. True individual freedom.  We can finally enjoy not being able to manage the global fallout with our complete lack of expertise and toolset.\n\nI for one look forward to the return to a local barter economy.",

Since they skipped the vetting process and deliberately inserted individuals with a clear \u201clooking for enemies of the state\u201d vibe, we could imagine   they might even code in a false flag to justify what they\u2019ve done.  If there are checks, we should know exactly what they are up to.  But we have no way of doing that, especially if voters and their representatives don\u2019t use their power to check others power.  \n\nWe might not care much to understand how much rigor was in these systems to prevent a banana republic, but it in fact was there. Now it is clearly not.\n\nEdit: Vance just tweeted that Judges aren\u2019t allowed to control the Executives legitimate power.",
