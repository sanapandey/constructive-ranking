There hasn\u2019t been anything major. And a lot of it is just dumb little shit. Like renaming the Gulf of Mexico\u2026 Hinting at taking Greenland and making Canada part of America is just stupidity that his base eats up lol how\u2019s that even \u201cAmerica first?\u201d \n\nAnd yes he has done things to lead in the right direction too. \n\nAnyway, it should be done the right way.

But neither side should be able to do something the other side can\u2019t, and neither side should be able to go against the constitution.

If you have a problem with how much Trump can do by EO, maybe consider that the *ACTUAL PROBLEM* is how much power has been concentrated into a singular office.\n\nI had hoped the Democrats would have learned that lesson after Trump 1.0 and curtailed the presidents powers under Biden.

It makes sense to strongly \"encourage\" a similar science based policy and defunding is a great motivator.\n\nBut carte blanch privatization of a public good is an unrelated separate topic.   Sometimes the cure is as bad or worse than the poison.   Can pro-privatization folks list what they consider to be some paragon examples of where privatization of a public good turned out well in the US?\n\nI ask because it's been increasingly impossible for me to miss the cases where in my view privatization has and is turning out very badly for humanity:\n\n* Privatization of Prisons creating an inverse incentive to incarcerate more people, complete with minimum occupancy contracts, and lobbyists that push for legislation and policy changes that will build their business by increasing the number of people subject to incarceration.   A decade old example that now comes to mind because of Biden's recent WTF pardoning of one of the judges,  is the ['Cash for Kids'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal) judge scandal, where judges were accepting kickbacks to impose harsh sentences on kids to increase the private prison occupancy.   The high court found many of the sentences to be \"in complete disregard for their constitutional rights\" and the Supreme court dismissed something like 4,000 of the prior convictions.\n* Another one we're watching play out in real-time, is where private for profit production of military ordinance and technology,  turns war into a profit center, creating a strong incentive for infinite war that yields infinite war profits.\n\nI'm starting to feel that due to the inverse incentives, there are some things a moral society simply cannot allow to become profit centers.  My short list at the moment is:  Freedom/Liberty, War, Health etc.",

Could you break down how these are comparatively an example of a successful privatization of education, and how the differences are not instead due to other cultural or education factors?    \n\nFrom a quick read all three countries have strong publicly funded education systems.  The difference relevant to this topic seems likely to be Sweden's Voucher system that allows families to choose private schools.    The other outlier is the insanely competitive, high stress South Korean system that while creating good results in terms of standard metrics, does so at the huge hidden cost of well-being as seen in the suicide rates.   But this strikes me as a cultural difference that could just as easily exist in a fully privatized school system.  As an example when I looked up suicide rates at US Universities, the little data I could publicly find shows private Universities almost exclusively at the top of the suicide rate list.",

In practice, parents will often choose happiness over learning, pseudoscience cures over learning.  The outcomes are probably still better than what we have in the US, and so Sweden is often an example of if we let people go wherever they pleased (including private through vouchers) because they would naturally choose better.  Free market.  If everyone had enough money, using money to choose privately would likely yield the same results.\n\nNext door is Finland, that reformed their system with a focus on equity.  They first created rigor in their educators, then empowered educators to make the decisions. The  educators focus on making sure whoever needs something unique, gets it (equity).  This mindset also leads to achievement based on a work/life balance.  It\u2019s not about outperforming someone else, it\u2019s about achieving the actual goal.  Their scores outperform Sweden, without that as their focus. People in the US don\u2019t like this because it\u2019s DEI.\n\nWe have to go further afield to look for the American idea of \u201cmaybe the fault is the parents lack of work ethic and standards\u201d. South Korea has a culture of hard work and striving and outperforming.  Parents and grandparents sacrifice to pay for private tutoring outside of school.  Kids continue to add more hours of studying to outperform their peers.  This is merit based, and private money influence, creating an arms race.  The result is slightly higher scores than Finland most of the time.  We can also imagine that when parents self fund and the culture is highly self motivated, public education can be cheaper (don\u2019t have to pay extra money to try to get a kid to care to learn).  That system, Completely private, would probably exacerbate the arms race issue.\n\nOur system is all over the place, comparatively.  In the US, kids in poverty come to school in much worse circumstances, and they receive services for learning, but not for what is making it hard for them to learn, because most of those things are not an education problem.  Free market might make us see that those in poverty freely choose schools with washing machines, job internships, ways to make revenue, ways to handle childcare, places to quietly study after school, other services that replace our lack of a social safety net.\n\nAn equity model would likely result in education looking to provide these services to replace the lack of a social safety net.\n\nA personal rigor private model would likely result in an arms race of hour spent like in South Korea, with those in poverty so outmatched they opt out to do something where they don\u2019t need to compete with an education they can\u2019t afford.  (You can see the echo to the muddiness of where we are.)\n\nMy two cents.",

Then I went to run errands and it finally clicked.   You were simply showing a relevant example directly in education where privatization was able to increase choice and agency without a significant change to an already well performing educational system.  Especially, in a Libertarian subredditt where freedom of choice and personal agency are highly valued this is a very favorable outcome for privatization.   Then instead of cherry picking your examples to create a strawman comparison, you chose to compare against other educational systems that weren't privatized but were also very high performing.\n\n>A personal rigor private model would likely result in an arms race of hour spent like in South Korea, with those in poverty so outmatched they opt out to do something where they don\u2019t need to compete with an education they can\u2019t afford. (You can see the echo to the muddiness of where we are.)\n\nExpanding on this or perhaps getting to a similar point by a different path:     Having been encouraged to read up a tiny bit on Sweden's \"school choice\"  voucher system,  one thing that stood out to me is that the private \"independent schools\" approved to receive public funding through vouchers, *are not allowed to charge additional tuition on top of the government-funded voucher.*  This ensures that high quality education is broadly available to everyone regardless of a families wealth, despite the privatization.    To me that seems like a core part why their voucher program didn't fail or yield undesirable outcomes in Sweden.\n\nSadly, all the school voucher programs I looked up in US States were allowing the schools to charge additional tuition on top of the public funding they get from the voucher.   Without that safeguard I fear a voucher program would instead have the results like you're describing for the \"personal rigor private\" model, where it would increase the already large disparity in educational opportunity based on wealth or socioeconomic status.  \"To the Highest Bidder\" / \"Winner Takes All\"  is not something that will turn out well when applied to education.\n\nI now know one thing to fight for, if my state decides to move to a voucher system:   For a school to be eligible to accept the public voucher funding, the voucher must cover the entire cost of that student's tuition.",
