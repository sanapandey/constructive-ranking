Like you don't have to pay for insurance. You don't have have to go to hospitals that accept medicare/medicaid (which is how the government enforces its regulations).  The options are rare, but they exist. \n\nIt is worse for people in UK who depend on NHS.  They are forced to pay for the bad system and then on top of that have to pay for private practice if they want decent care in a timely manner. \n\nIt is even worse for people in Canada were private healrhcare is simply not allowed in most situations. They have less freedom then the British do.  People with serious problems just have to run to the USA.  I can't imagine that is that pleasant or cheap.",

It\u2019ll leave alot of people worse off, enrich a lot of bad actors. \n\nPrice transparency is helpful for sure but not the end all. Two places can offer similar services but the quality can vary greatly while still being the same on paper. Medical imaging is a great example. Go shop around on a price for an MRI, one center will advertise cheapest cash price in town, but they don\u2019t tell you it\u2019s an outdated machine that can\u2019t provide the same level of detail and diagnostic certainty as a newer higher field strength MRI the hospital uses. Regular people don\u2019t know the difference. But by the time you and up at the right diagnosis and an effective treatment you\u2019ll have paid for the better quality scan and the shitty one. You get what you pay for.\n\nThen take into account validated and studied therapies compared to the rash of other unregulated shit out there, the remnants of snake oil sales culture. Stem cell injections, various cosmetic procedures, naturopathy, chiropractic stuff. None of it stands up to actual scientific rigor.  It\u2019s extensively studied with nothing approaching proof of efficacy. But that doesn\u2019t stop a lot of people from either flirting with or outright falsely advertising about the benefits of a lot of these things. And that\u2019s *with some oversight in place currently. When it\u2019s gone you\u2019re back to the bad old days, people will suffer morbidity and mortality, lucky ones will get patched back together in hospitals. When people get really truly sick they all wind up in one place.",

People pay for their own meds, visits, procedures, durable medical equipment, and eventual nursing home type care. Without artificial supplementation of the market some of the costs will come down but others wont. There will also be less effective quality control in the care provided. \n\n2. Fully government supplied insurance. Many issues there, obviously. The benefit over what we have now would be that its not attached to employment anymore, you could theoretically vote for change in the way your healthcare is administrated, the system could be streamlined for providers, and quality control would be easy. \n\nOption 1 cant really happen unless we are willing to let people die early from easily preventable diseases. Option 2 is inviting too much governmental control in. However, either one is better than this shit we do now where Im overregulated while dancing through unnecessary moving goalposts for insurance companies to try to help pts who cant afford the copays and coinsurance anyway.",

I don\u2019t think option 1 is viable without significant changes to how healthcare is delivered although I do think it\u2019s the better of the two options.  At the end of the day healthcare is a finite resource so will be either rationed by your ability to pay or by the government dictating what and what won\u2019t be paid for.  Personally even though I\u2019m in a relatively healthy financial position compared to the majority of Americans, I know that I couldn\u2019t afford a long hospital stay, but despite all that I don\u2019t think that means government should ever be in the position to ration care.
