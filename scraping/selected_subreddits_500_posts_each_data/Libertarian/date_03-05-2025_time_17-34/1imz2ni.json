If there isn\u2019t justification for criminal charges, then there probably isn\u2019t actual, provable fraud. If the evidence shows wasteful spending rather than fraud, then let\u2019s fix it through the appropriate channels so that the waste isn\u2019t easily rebooted after the next regime change. Also, let\u2019s stop calling it fraud. Instead, let\u2019s be honest and expose the legal channels that allowed this type of questionable spending. That way, we can have accountability and transparency.\u201d\n\nWithout working through the proper channels, this will all be rebooted in a near future regime change. And democrats WILL claw their way back to the executive soon enough. And wasteful republicans will as well. We\u2019ll all suffer some whiplash because of it.\u00a0",
