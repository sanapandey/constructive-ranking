    "selftext": "The 1994 Budapest Memorandum is often misrepresented as a binding military agreement that obligates the U.S. to defend Ukraine. That is simply not true. The memorandum, signed by Ukraine, the U.S., the U.K., and Russia, was a diplomatic assurance in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. The agreement reaffirmed that all signatories would respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, refrain from using force or economic coercion against it, and seek United Nations Security Council action if Ukraine was threatened with nuclear weapons. However, nowhere in the memorandum does it state that the U.S. or U.K. are required to provide military aid or intervene in a conflict. Unlike NATO\u2019s Article 5, which explicitly requires mutual defense, the Budapest Memorandum contains no military commitments and has no enforcement mechanism.\n\nThis also means the memorandum does not justify the U.S. going to war with Russia over Ukraine. The only specific action mentioned is seeking U.N. intervention in the event of nuclear weapons being used. There is no legal or military obligation for the U.S. to send troops or weapons. Ukraine did not secure a defense guarantee like Japan or South Korea, which have formal treaties ensuring U.S. military protection. If Ukraine wanted that level of security, they should have negotiated for it instead of relying on vague diplomatic assurances. It\u2019s not America\u2019s fault that Ukraine signed a weak deal. Unlike Japan and South Korea, which ensured their defense with explicit treaties, Ukraine gambled its security on an unenforceable promise. That is a failure of their leadership, not a U.S. responsibility to fix.\n\nDespite this, the U.S. has funneled billions of dollars into Ukraine\u2019s war effort, not out of legal obligation but for geopolitical strategy. This is about using Ukraine as a proxy to weaken Russia, not about fulfilling some ironclad defense commitment. The most reckless take is the idea that the U.S. must escalate the conflict, even at the risk of nuclear war, simply because of an old diplomatic agreement. The Budapest Memorandum does not require America to fight World War III over Ukraine. The U.S. never committed to guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s security\u2014only to respecting its sovereignty. That is a crucial difference, and it is one that should end the argument that this agreement justifies endless funding and reckless escalation.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t trust me look at the actual document:\u00a0[https://policymemos.hks.harvard.edu/files/policymemos/files/2-23-22\\_ukraine-the\\_budapest\\_memo.pdf?m=1645824948](https://policymemos.hks.harvard.edu/files/policymemos/files/2-23-22_ukraine-the_budapest_memo.pdf?m=1645824948)",

The Budapest Memorandum was a diplomatic assurance, not a defense pact. It never obligated the U.S. to defend Ukraine militarily, and pretending otherwise is just rewriting history.\n\nAbout the \u201cwe need to honor our promise or no one will give up nukes again\u201d argument. First off, the U.S. never \u201cpromised\u201d military intervention. The document literally says that if Ukraine is threatened, the signatories are supposed to seek consultations and take the issue to the UN\u2014not send troops, not go to war, just talk. That\u2019s what was agreed to, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. The U.S. and U.K. have given billions in aid, weapons, and support\u2014far more than what the Budapest Memorandum actually required.\n\nSecond, no country is giving up nukes based on a piece of paper anyway (except Ukraine.) The idea that if we don\u2019t \u201chonor\u201d this vague, unenforceable memo, countries will suddenly refuse to denuclearize is nonsense. Countries keep nukes because they know military power is the only real security guarantee\u2014not because of a handshake agreement made 30 years ago. North Korea, Iran, and any other nuclear-ambitious country don\u2019t give a damn about what happened to Ukraine\u2014they care about military deterrence, period.\n\nThe U.S. isn\u2019t \u201cbreaking\u201d anything by not going to war for Ukraine. Ukraine signed a bad deal. That\u2019s not America\u2019s problem to fix. If Ukraine wanted real security, it should have negotiated a military defense treaty like Japan or South Korea did. Instead, it put its trust in vague diplomatic promises with no enforcement mechanism. That\u2019s not America\u2019s fault, and it sure as hell doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re obligated to throw endless money and weapons into the conflict. The Budapest Memorandum was never a war guarantee, and anyone still pushing that argument either hasn\u2019t read the document or is deliberately ignoring reality.",

First, freeze the conflict at the current line of control\u2014March 2025\u2019s ugly scar across Ukraine\u2019s east and south. That\u2019s Russia squatting on Crimea, 80% of Donbas, and chunks of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson\u201418-20% of Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 turf, per Institute for the Study of War mappings. Call it a done deal for now\u2014no more grinding advances, no more body bags for a few extra miles. Step two: ram through the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal that cratered on February 28. It\u2019s a $50 billion, 10-year pact to tap Ukraine\u2019s rare earth jackpot\u201490% of its graphite in Donetsk (500 million tons, 10% of global reserves), lithium deposits in Luhansk and Kirovohrad (Polokhivske\u2019s got 3% of world totals), plus titanium in Zhytomyr, per Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection. These ain\u2019t just rocks\u2014graphite\u2019s for EV batteries, lithium\u2019s tech fuel, titanium\u2019s jet-grade. Deploy U.S. firms\u2014Albemarle for lithium, Tesla sniffing graphite\u2014boots on the ground, not just cash. Most of these deposits hug that Donbas frontline, 240 klicks from Russian guns\u2014perfect for a human shield. American citizens working those mines mean any Russian push hits our people, spiking the stakes.\n\nStep three: carve a demilitarized zone\u201440 kilometers wide, 1,000 kilometers long, from Luhansk down to Kherson, a buffer straight out of the Korean Armistice playbook. Stock it with European NATO horsepower: Poland\u2019s 3rd Armoured Division rolls in 30,000 troops with 300 Leopard 2 tanks; the UK\u2019s 16 Air Assault Brigade drops 10,000 paratroopers, rapid-deployment vets from Afghanistan; Germany\u2019s Rapid Forces Division adds 15,000 with Puma IFVs\u201455,000 total, no half-measures. Arm them heavy: 500 Javelin launchers (2,000 missiles), 50 MQ-9 Reaper drones, ELINT rigs like the UK\u2019s Watchkeeper, and mobile radar to spot Russian arty 50 klicks out. Fund it with a $10 billion NATO-EU escrow\u2014Germany\u2019s flush with $42 billion in Ukraine aid already, France can spare $2 billion, Poland\u2019s got skin in the game at $5 billion. Coordinate via NATO\u2019s Enhanced Forward Presence, rotating 18-month tours, ironclad rules of engagement: Russia crosses, they eat lead.\n\nStep four: lock in a ceasefire treaty\u2014Kyiv, Moscow, U.S., NATO, UN at the table, plus Turkey as a Black Sea wildcard with Erdogan\u2019s grain-deal cred. Ink it tight: any Russian breach of the DMZ spills NATO blood, triggering Article 5 and WW3. Putin\u2019s burning $150 billion a year now\u2014$400 billion total since \u201822, 725,000 casualties\u2014and his $260 billion reserves won\u2019t outlast a global slugfest; China and India ($200 billion trade) ditch him fast if he\u2019s dumb enough to try. Satellite data (Maxar, Feb 2025) shows his Donbas gains stalling\u20142,000 square klicks since October\u2014so he\u2019s got no juice for a big swing. The minerals deal seals it: $15-25 billion yearly from Donbas mines (Kyiv School of Economics est.) pumps Ukraine\u2019s GDP 20% by 2028, per World Bank math\u2014$50 billion just to rebuild Gaza-level ruin\u2014while U.S. citizens on-site tie our economic fate to theirs, a $10 billion stateside profit stream securing battery supply chains off China\u2019s 70% chokehold.\n\nThis ain\u2019t charity\u2014it\u2019s a steel trap. European NATO troops\u201455,000 strong\u2014hold the DMZ, not American kids; Putin\u2019s boxed in, not appeased; Ukraine gets a lifeline, not a blank check. We\u2019ve burned $182.8 billion already\u2014halt that bleed, pivot to Asia-Pacific, and let Europe carry the torch. If Putin blinks, he\u2019s facing 55,000 NATO rifles and a $10 trillion alliance GDP\u2014$150 billion war burn\u2019s a rounding error there. He won\u2019t\u2014he\u2019s a thug, not a kamikaze. Minerals keep America invested, not just bleeding sympathy\u2014prosperity\u2019s the best deterrent. That\u2019s the call: de-escalate smart, not surrender. What\u2019s your better shot, genius\u2014keep funding a meat grinder or we can grow some balls and end it the right way?",

They can grind Ukraine down as long as the U.S. keeps writing blank checks.

The U.S. was never required to go to war for Ukraine\u2014that\u2019s a fact. It committed to diplomatic support, not military intervention. But right now, we\u2019re stuck in a situation where that memo is being twisted into an excuse for an open-ended blank check, with no strategy beyond \u201csend more money and weapons.\u201d That\u2019s unsustainable.\n\nMy plan actually forces an end to the war by freezing the conflict at the current lines and deterring future Russian aggression in a way that doesn\u2019t require endless U.S. funding. The key difference is that instead of just dumping aid into Ukraine indefinitely, we shift the burden to European NATO forces, create an economic investment structure through the minerals deal, and turn Ukraine into a self-sustaining state instead of a welfare client.\n\nYes, NATO troops in a DMZ act as a deterrent, but that\u2019s not \u201cescalation.\u201d That\u2019s a stabilizing force\u2014exactly like how NATO has forces in the Baltics and South Korea has a DMZ. The alternative is what we have now: an indefinite war that Russia can keep grinding away at, while Ukraine bleeds out and the West keeps throwing money into a black hole.\n\nPutin already has an incentive to stop\u2014he\u2019s burning cash and bodies at an insane rate\u2014but he also knows that as long as the U.S. keeps Ukraine afloat, he can just wait us out. By setting clear red lines with NATO troops in a DMZ, securing U.S. economic stakes through minerals, and making it clear there\u2019s no more \u201cfree\u201d aid, we cut off Russia\u2019s ability to play the long game. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nSo no, my plan isn\u2019t \u201cmore defense of Ukraine\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a structured, enforceable way to stop the war without turning this into a forever war.

I will counter the whole narrative of command economy creating the conditions by which the Japanese were interned as maybe not entirely accurate. I submit this: the only place in the United States where we found direct Japanese Empire influence on Japanese citizens to induce espionage and potential sabotage was Hawai\u2019i. Guess where no Japanese-American folks were interned? Hawai\u2019i.  The history of what lead up to 1066 was a very intense and directed effort by \u201cnative\u201d American farmers who through straight racism or out-competition by Japanese-American farmers lobbied the government to declare such people as threats: Roosevelt knew he needed the majority of farmers to help support the war effort and folded to their demands. It\u2019s sticky, for sure; but to invalidate the morality and positive world-outcomes of our involvement in WW2 based on the internment of Japanese Americans from a command-economy perspective ignores the horrific racist motivations of those that lobbied for it. The Roosevelt name will always be stained with this sin, but there is NOWHERE near enough attention paid to those who lobbied for it out of ghoulish fear and hatred",

                                    "body": "This is a perfect example of cherry-picking lines from the Budapest Memorandum without understanding what the document actually says\u2014or what it doesn\u2019t say.\n\nFirst, reaffirming a commitment to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty does not mean the U.S. is obligated to fund an endless war or reject negotiations outright. Nowhere in the Budapest Memorandum does it state that the U.S. must keep pouring billions into Ukraine indefinitely or oppose a diplomatic settlement. In fact, the document explicitly states that in the event of a security threat, the signatories are supposed to seek consultations and bring the matter to the UN\u2014not automatically go to war.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s address this idea that \u201cTrump must shut up about a deal.\u201d Diplomacy is how wars end. If your argument is that negotiating peace is somehow a betrayal, then you\u2019re essentially advocating for a forever war with no clear exit strategy. Ukraine has lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers, is running out of manpower, and is now begging for more aid while the U.S. is footing the bill. At some point, there has to be an off-ramp, and refusing to even discuss a settlement is pure delusion.\n\nThird, the whole \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d argument ignores reality. Ukraine\u2019s borders in 1994 are not the same as Ukraine\u2019s borders in 2025. The fact is, Russia has de facto control over Crimea and significant portions of the Donbas. You can shout about maps and agreements all you want, but in the real world, borders are determined by who holds the ground. Pretending that these territories can be taken back by sheer force at this point is fantasy.\n\nFinally, to be clear\u2014nobody \u201cvictim-blamed\u201d Ukraine. Acknowledging that NATO expansion, the 2014 coup, and years of ignoring Russian security concerns contributed to this war isn\u2019t victim-blaming; it\u2019s understanding the full picture. You can scream about Budapest all day, but at the end of the day, Ukraine signed a weak, unenforceable document instead of securing an actual defense treaty. That\u2019s not America\u2019s fault.",

Ukraine has received over $182 billion in military aid, advanced weapons systems, intelligence, training, and economic support. That\u2019s more aid than entire U.S. states get for infrastructure. If you think that equates to \u201cnobody caring,\u201d then you\u2019re either willfully ignorant or just too blinded by rage to think logically.\n\nSecond, you bring up 1938 and the Munich Agreement like you\u2019re the first person to ever invoke it. Here\u2019s the problem\u2014Ukraine is not Czechoslovakia, and Russia is not Nazi Germany. Germany in 1938 was a rapidly expanding power with a massive military buildup and an economy in overdrive, prepping for full-scale continental war. Russia in 2025? A corrupt petrostate that can\u2019t even take all of Donbas after three years of fighting. You act like Putin is going to sweep through Europe, when in reality, his military has been struggling just to hold what they\u2019ve already taken.\n\nThird, you\u2019re out here acting like you get to dictate what the U.S. does with its own money and policy. Newsflash: American taxpayers don\u2019t owe you a damn thing. The U.S. has already done more for Ukraine than it ever committed to under any agreement. If we decide that endless blank checks and weapons shipments aren\u2019t in our national interest anymore, that\u2019s not \u201cforcing you to surrender\u201d\u2014that\u2019s called prioritizing our own security and economic stability. You\u2019re free to keep fighting, but don\u2019t expect the rest of the world to bankroll your war indefinitely.\n\nFinally, you say, \u201cif you don\u2019t wanna help, stop interfering.\u201d Here\u2019s a reality check: Ukraine wouldn\u2019t last three months without U.S. and NATO support. If the West pulls out, you don\u2019t get to \u201ckeep fighting\u201d\u2014you get rolled over. So maybe drop the self-righteous victim complex and realize that diplomacy isn\u2019t \u201csurrender\u201d\u2014it\u2019s the only path to survival that doesn\u2019t involve total destruction. You don\u2019t have to like it, but screaming insults and comparing everything to WW2 isn\u2019t a strategy\u2014it\u2019s just whining",
