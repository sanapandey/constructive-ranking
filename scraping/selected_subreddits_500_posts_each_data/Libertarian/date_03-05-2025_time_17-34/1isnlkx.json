The tyranny of the majority is where the majority rule at the core of democracy marginalises the needs and interests of minority groups. The quote is saying that democracy today benefits the (1%) minority at the cost of the needs and interest of the majority.",

A network of decentralized city states ran by the dominant industry of the region, but don't worry it won't be like the hunger games, and since all of the money belongs to them, and you just get paid in company scrip you won't pay taxes, therefore, you'll be freer, because we all know that the only metric to measure liberty is tax rate.",
