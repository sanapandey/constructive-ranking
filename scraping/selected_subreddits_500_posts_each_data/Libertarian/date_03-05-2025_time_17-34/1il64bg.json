I have lost about all faith that the people would reclaim America one day. Not many of these people even know what the federal reserve is or care. History is laughed at as a conspiracy now. No one seems to question the military industrial complex, constant wars, or the federal reserve banking cartel. They don't seem to connect the big large dots that spell out \"YOU GOT FUCKED\". They just get defensive and start to stutter the word conspiracy. I see posts from people, literally ASKING to be taxed more, to help fund the goverment properly. Can't even make this shit up, saddest case of stockholm syndrome I have ever seen. ",

Details?\n\nWe already know people gain from the current structure of the corporations using the government, IP Laws and regulations to maintain their cartels while the politicians and administrators of the regulatory agencies make fat stacks. Sounds like we should slash some agencies then if thats your concern. \n\nI agree, a reduction in the amount I pay to a wasteful corrupt government is unlikely since the state always expands if it can. \n\nI'm not expecting anything, but I'm enjoying the parts concerning dismantling of the state so far and the meltdowns and the humor. Anti-fascists protesting on the behalf of the state is hilarious. Rage for the machine.\n\n As for how I feel about other unrelated policies of the admin, state gonna state, amirite? I would have to look at each one individually. I'm always against the state doing anything besides getting rid of itself.\n\nEdit: your concern about them ripping apart the state is that the state is corrupt and will some allow them to profit while dismantling the state. Correct?",
