There are so many branches of government and aspects of corporate policy that are being questioned and they clearly don't know how to justify their bloated budgets  because they are used to being shielded from any kind of criticism or even oversight.\n\nLeast: He's also reintroduced a lot of fundamentally bad ideas. Tariffs as building wealth. The idea of a government owned investment fund. The government buying Tiktok. Using coersion to get countries to hand over land. The lone great man can fix all the problems if you give him power. You can't take him at his word (\"Seriously, but not literally\"). Ideas don't matter, only power and \"success\". You can (and should) use government to punish those you don't like.\n\nReal talk, the large number of his fans and media sycophants that use paternal language to describe him is pathetic and gross.",
