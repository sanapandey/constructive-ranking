    "selftext": "Hi friends,\n\nUnder the current stream of events, as you might imagine, a very hot topic of discussion is whether US billionaires have a disproportionate amount of power.\n\nTo be sure, this is a complex topic. My first thought is that we have to approach it comparatively: e.g., do US billionaires have disproportionately more power than French billionaires? Second, there is no clear metric of what having and exerting power really means.\n\nI would be very curious to hear your thoughts on this, and to read any good resources you have on this subject.\n\nThanks!",

Compounding interest and investment returns are a huge factor compared to salary. And once you have that kind of money it only grows faster each additional year. \n\nIf you find examples of younger politicians with sky high net worth on ONLY a politician salary then that\u2019s noteworthy. \n\nBut everyone brings up Bernie Sanders when all he would\u2019ve had to do is save and invest reasonably over many decades.",
