Companies had to throttle back supply, they were shut down, while demand went through the roof as we had people flush with cash. Not needing to pay your essentials worsened it even further by keeping more money in the peoples pockets to buy more shit from the inflated prices of the companies dwindling supply. \n\nThis is the effect of the hasty decisions made 5 years ago. It was either this outcome, or it would\u2019ve been a recession. Both suck, but I\u2019d rather have a job and make decisions on what extras I want, then not having a job and can\u2019t pay my bills to keep a roof over my head.",

So it seems that the majority of the current inflation and economic problems we are facing right now stem from the rich, and their free money propelling the majority of consumer purchasing here in the states. \n\nBut we are still missing some of the important, historical information from the timeline, such as the legislation that has bestowed ridiculous power upon the already largest of corporations. And we cannot forget: every bribe that\u2019s turned into legislation for a corporation is like a piece of pie given to that corp, and the American gov also retains a piece of that pie; however, there are a million corporations, but only one US government. So speaking on our housing issues, Clinton introduced legislation allowing banks to invest into areas of the market they never should have been allowed in the first place. Combining that with the 0% interest bull market for 2 decades, housing is now monopolized on both sides of the market (manufacturing and sales - housing companies will halt building until prices for housing goes back up and they are getting top dollar). \n\nThis is a vague example, but with slow degradation of philosophy came small changes to legislation, and after accumulating for decades, our inability to sustain (whether foreign or domestic) our policies, laws, economy, etc. is plain as day to our citizens, partners, and the rest of the world. \n\nBut we (as in the majority of American people) keep arguing about covid and its conspiracy theories, instead of the core issues that it brought to light. When we can argue about the right things, we will begin to see change. Our elected officials will continue to play dumb, lazy, and complacent until we (the majority) can force them to organize.",
