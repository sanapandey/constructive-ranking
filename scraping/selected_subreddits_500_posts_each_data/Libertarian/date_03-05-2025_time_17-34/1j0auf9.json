(Except for maybe high utilization, but that\u2019s temporary) you then transfer that debt to a new card at the end of the year. There\u2019s several credit cards that offer 0% apr for 1 year plus. You could theoretically do this for the rest of your lift it\u2019s just a dangerous game. The realistic limited factor are these credit cards tend to have $1000-5000 limits.",

Eventually your utilization will run too high and lower your score, and that will impact your ability to get approved for a new card.\n\nAlso like you said, the issue would be the credit limit on the individual card. It\u2019s not that they limit you to $1k-$5k, you can definitely get cards with higher limits. But they\u2019re not going to keep giving you higher and higher limits to support your carried debt unless you\u2019re significantly increasing your income, and even then there are limits.",

So if I\u2019m juggling 5000 and I have 4 cards with a 5000 limit once I open a 5th card my utilization goes from 25% to 20%\n\nCredit card companies don\u2019t look at your available credit when they approve you. They might take into account your debt but so long as you aren\u2019t increasing this you could easily play this game. \n\nAlso in the eyes of these companies you are clearing your balance when you transfer it to another card. And a credit score simply measures your ability to pay back debt. Not how good you are with money.",

If you\u2019re saying you can keep juggling the $5000 for the rest of your life sure, but that doesn\u2019t really match the original point of continuing to spend and never paying the debt.\n\n**2. You\u2019re juggling the $5000 and plan to increase the amount of debt you\u2019re carrying:** Your spending will probably outpace the increases in credit limits you can get, and there are a few other credit scoring factors to consider if you\u2019re constantly getting new cards, like number of inquiries, number of new accounts, average age of accounts, etc. And again lenders _do_ (although I\u2019m sure it varies) look at your other debt when underwriting your CC application, so eventually you\u2019ll hit a stopping point.",
