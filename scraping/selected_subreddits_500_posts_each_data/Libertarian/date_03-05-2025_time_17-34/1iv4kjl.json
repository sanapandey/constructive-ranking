I believe the private sector can serve that need **better** than unionized government employees.\n\nA for-profit park ranger/security/tourism service would have just as many park rangers as necessary, and, they could charge patrons a daily or annual fee\u2026**voluntarily, without taxation**.\n\n>\u201d*helping police people who are damaging the park by destroying nature or polluting.*\u201d\n\nBoth Roosevelt presidents significantly expanded the federal parks by confiscated land.  \n\nI see no benefit in having Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s government increase federal land ownership from 43 million to 194 million acres during his presidency; especially when decades later we are facing a homeless crisis in many major U.S. cities.\n\nTed Turner, Bill Gates, Donald Bren, and countless other private entrepreneurs have purchased land and designated it for conservational and public use.   \n\nI don\u2019t think the DMV needs to have a monopoly over this or anything because \u201c**how you do anything is how you do everything.**\u201d\n\n>\u201d*This isn\u2019t the hill you want to die on.*\u201d\n\nI have nothing against the existence of the position in the free market.  If you or other customers enjoy the lands then why should I be taxed and forced to pay it?\n\nHow is this any different than the argument that socialist make to socialize healthcare?  \n\nBetween park rangers and doctors, doctors are arguably in high demand than park rangers.  Why not have the government hire doctors instead of letting them compete in the market?\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen what happens with government-run healthcare (VA system) compared to the private-counterparts.\n\nPracticing medicine is more complicated than Kate\u2019s line of work.\n\nAt **$36 trillion of national debt**, this is an easy government job to not lose any sleep over. \n\nThe less debt we pass on to future generations, the better.",
