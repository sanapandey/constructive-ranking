    "selftext": "I filed my taxes pretty much the day you were allowed to finally start filing them and software I use told me that it got accepted by the IRS. Even got an email and everything yet on the website of the IRS when I go to put in where's my refund information which is just my social security filing status and the amount of the refund, not very hard to put those numbers putting them in, yet I'm told my information is incorrect. I'm so sick trashy customer service and it extends to sorry ass government entities that don't have constitutional right to be taking anybody's money and staying at the end of the year old we might give it back to you provided we feel like it and somebody doesn't screw something up along the way cuz let me tell you every goddamn year they do. Yet the worthless coworkers that decide not to come to work ever and I end up having to cover their shifts I always seem to cross that little earned income tax credit line Twitter they're eligible and get more than what my refund is all together added on to their refund. And it's like this with every aspect of my life hard work don't pay off doing the right thing don't pay off yet I can't live with myself to be an uncountable worthless lazy piece of shit like the rest of the world has come to be especially post covid.

Last few years, my circumstances are that I paid taxes once after I filed taxes and they were calculated based on the entire year before. I didn't realize about quarterly taxes and such. But I paid on time what I owed when I filed and thought I was good.\nSeveral months later I get a bill for interest on the money since I hadn't paid during the year. Never felt so ripped off on my life. So for 40+ years the government could hold my money and pay me once exactly what they withheld, but in our case we owe extra for doing that same thing?",
