I probably have more sympathy towards Israel's position in the Middle East, being surrounded by enemies(I believe their state has a right to exist)than many other libertarians. However, I do not want to pay for their state, and anyone who takes the time to study the incident can't possibly come out of it, believing it wasn't intentional. LBJ allowed it to be covered up.",

For a lot of people \"higher levels\" speculative concepts are more real then what actually exists in the real world, physically, but I don't buy into that way of thinking.\n\nBut that isn't something unique to Israel. it is something that applies to all states. \n\nWhat the people of Isreal do have rights to, however, is to not be messed with or violently assaulted or robbed or otherwise be subject to violent aggressive behavior. Which is the same rights that everybody else has.\n\nIf you go just North of current day Israel in the Levant coast into Jordan, Syria, etc... You find yourself in a region of the world with the longest unbroken peace, until modern times.  No major wars, no major conflicts, no ethnic cleansings, etc. \n\nAnd also intensely diverse. Pockets of people of different historical backgrounds and religions living in their own communities in close proximity to one another.  Different Islamic sects, different Christian groups, Rabbinic Jews, and several other minority religious and ethnic groups.   \n\nIt existed a center of commerce and culture and intersection between Asia, Europe, and Africa. \n\nAll of that existed until modern concepts of state were pushed on them through European colonialism followed by various forms of National Socialist anti-colonial forces (Syrian movement, for example). \n\nSince then it has been a nightmare of wars and conflicts, religious persecutions, and ethnic cleansings. Especially in the past few decades as it has attracted the attention of \"the international community\" who tried to \"help\" in the name of \"democracy\". \n\n\nThis is why the only real sane position to be anti-state. \n\nThere has always been little ethnic conflicts and infighting and people not getting along with their neighbors. In many regions of the world this is normal and expected behavior. Even sometimes it is traditional and not something people there particularly want to see go away. \n\nBut it isn't until you get these concepts of \"state\" involved that it turns into a irreconcilable bloodbaths and endlessly unstable. \n\nThat is why the only sane position is to be anti-state.  It is just a vehicle for violence. \"War is the health of the state\" is no joke.",

Individual vs. collection \"rights and the debate around it is not some new premise . So yes a country does have a right to exists if the individuals in that country decide for it to.\n\nAnarchists ignore human nature with the whole \"if everyone just lived and let live\" ideology the same as Marxists with their \"if everyone would just share their wealth evenly.\" It sounds nice, but it is not reality. even If you have a libertarian paradise for a country, but it s surrounded by corrupt Marxist hellholes. You won't have a prosperous, safe country for long with an open border. If you have a land full of zero centralized government and the country a few hundred miles away is poorer but has a 5 million man standing army I don't know what a loosely led group of militias will do outside of nasty guerrilla warfare campaign that will wreak havoc on the population. . \n\nAnarchists always act like a countries border is some made up arbitrary line yet expect people to respect the border of their property, which is just as arbitrary and open for interpretation. Human nature always wins out, and the desire for power will infect every society without exception. A rule of law that restrains that as best as possible is the best safeguard, even if just for a while. To quote Thomas Sowell, there are no solutions only trade-offs.",
