Taking Crimea bought Putin time, and it was transformed into a military asset from a logistics standpoint by creating the massive bridge and railway that connects Crimea to Russia. Before the bridge/rail, all there was was a ferry.",

Nothing was ever put in writing, Gorbachev himself was never clear about what was or wasn't promised. Whether the promise had to do with east vs west Berlin or anything else. Regardless nothing was ever officially agreed to, so it doesn't matter.\n\nEven if some informal promise was made to the USSR, the USSR dissolved so any promises made dissolved with them. This guy is just a fucking shill.",

It\u2019s not like NATO had a gun to their head and said join or else, though from the Russian perspective I guess that\u2019s how they thought it went down because thats how they conduct diplomacy. It\u2019s like yes NATO expanded which antagonized Russia, but that happened because Russia was antagonistic to the West and all the countries who have since joined NATO at one point perceived Russia a major threat. It so ridiculous to say Russia is the victim here when they\u2019re the ones who constantly start shit and then call foul when it\u2019s not working out in their favor. The world doesn\u2019t work that way.",

If a few thousand dollars of Russian ads during US elections is called \"interference\", what do you call American actions across Eastern Europe?\n\n\nAs far as having a \"gun to your head\", Yanukovych literally had them. And the US State Department was selecting his replacement.\u00a0\n\n\n>all the countries who have since joined NATO at one point perceived Russia a major threat.\n\n\nI'm sure countries like Albania, \"North Macedonia\", or Bulgaria really perceive Russia as a threat! /s\n\n\nTheir major threat is their neighbors, and internal unrest (which can be amplified whenever those countries follow a direction the US doesn't approve). Joining NATO and buying weapon systems for the US is a way of paying \"protection\" money.\n\n\n>they\u2019re the ones who constantly start shit\n\n\nHow many countries has Russia invaded and occupied since 1990, compared to the US? If the US can invade Panama or Grenada just in the past 40 years (so that I don't have to write a long list going further back), why can't Russia on similar \"national security\" claims against its neighbors?\u00a0",

Only an idiot would focus on one discussion point from 35 years ago as reason for absolutely disgusting Russian behavior.  I think everyone was shocked in the 90's at how badly all former soviet states and soviet satellite states wanted to be in NATO because it didn't take long after the Soviet Union collapse to find out how evil Russia was, or how much everyone wanted protection from them.  \n\nRussia's irredentism has never swayed and they have never given up the idea that the people and lands trapped in the USSR belong to them.  Russia has proven themselves to be a murderous regime that is hellbent on recapturing their former enslaved states to abuse again and use them for the financial gain of Moscow. \n\nRussia still funds antagonism and division in the US. They use social media to stoke dissent and fund opposing US groups (eg Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter) through groups like the Internet Research Agency and Storm-1516. They still support drug cartels moving drugs into the US. They still push ridiculous narratives on the US and its allies. Russian disinformation is still pushing a narrative on a biolab in Ukraine and when pushed on where it was, they pointed to a public health building. If it was an actual biolab, they would have blown it up. Russia still jails dissidents and murders people in NATO countries in public, often with poisons that were bioengineered by Russia or with common Russian poisons (like polonium), just to let NATO know it was them when NATO countries cant actually prove it with a smoking gun. And now, they're are using meat grinder tactics to murder people at a rate that will make the Russo-Ukrainian war surpass the Second Congo War as the deadliest since WWII. I studied Russian disinformation in graduate school for my second Master's Degree. They are absolutely an enemy, not because of circumstance or NATO behavior, but because they are a shit country run by FSB/KGB criminals who are USSR fanboys. Fuck Russia and anyone who shills their disinformation. \n\nI'm extremely Libertarian, but Russia is a repeatedly failed criminal state and you get downvoted by Russian bots on social media for saying it.",

                            "body": "Ukraine faces more corporate corruption, as the central government lacks the power to effectively reign them in. Like any country with somewhat uneven distribution of wealth, individuals, even some in power, will behave corruptly. Ukraine ranks *104/180 in corruption, which isn't great but also isn't terrible. It's somewhat near the middle. \n\nRussia has worked very hard to spin Ukraine, a country somewhat in the middle of the corruption scale, as terribly corrupt, when Russia themselves rank *154/180 (in the top 20% of most corrupt nations). Russia is in company with Lebanon, Chad, and Cambodia in the rankings. In fact, Russian disinformation is woven into all facets of their academia and media and they spend a great deal of their resources to proliferate their disinformation and dominate the information space. \n\nRussian disinformation is extremely effective in hyper-polarized populations, like the US (unfortunately), where groups will take an opposing view to their opponent's views, out of spite. Then they search for 'facts' to back up their determined reality. Russia is always waiting in the wings to supply these 'facts'. So, yes, Ukraine is not without corruption, but it isn't anywhere near the degree that Russia, and many of its information proxies, try to sell it. Widespread corruption was the next best disinformation claim when very few people outside of Russia would believe that Ukrainians were Nazis.\n\n*https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024 is one of many corruption indices. I haven't found one where Ukraine is anywhere near as corrupt as Russia.",
