    "selftext": "I came to Australia chasing freedom, but it\u2019s a suffocating trap that grinds every ounce of liberty into dust. Here\u2019s why I regret it, with the ugly truth laid out plain:\n\n* Absence of Firearm Rights: Guns are a fantasy here\u2014no Second Amendment, no rights, just a neutered population. Post-1996 Port Arthur, they yanked over 600,000 firearms in a mandatory buyback, leaving law-abiding folks defenseless while crooks still get theirs on the black market. You\u2019re stuck praying the cops show up in time, which they don\u2019t\u2014rural break-ins spiked after the ban, and good luck if you\u2019re out in the bush. The state\u2019s turned you into prey and calls it progress.\n\n* Lack of Robust Self-Defense Laws: Self-defense is a hollow shell\u2014no castle doctrine, no stand-your-ground, just a system that screws you for fighting back. In 2017, a farmer in NSW shot an intruder and faced jail time\u2014courts cared more about the thug\u2019s rights than his. You\u2019re expected to flee or take a beating in your own home; anything more, and you\u2019re the criminal. It\u2019s a gutless setup that rewards weakness and punishes guts.\n\n* Collectivist Public Mindset: The locals here fetishize the state like it\u2019s their savior. They rave about Medicare, cheer gun bans, and nod along to every overreach\u2014think the 2021 lockdowns where drones tracked joggers and cops fined people for sitting on benches. Ask about private solutions, and they\u2019ll sneer; they\u2019d rather suck the government teat than stand on their own. It\u2019s a herd of sheep begging for a tighter pen, and liberty\u2019s the punchline.\n\n* Pervasive Internet and Game Censorship: Censorship\u2019s a relentless chokehold\u2014games like Disco Elysium got refused classification for drug references, and classics like Fallout 3 had to be neutered to sell. The internet\u2019s worse: the 2019 Christchurch attack sparked laws letting the eSafety Commissioner block sites at will\u2014thousands of domains got axed with zero transparency. That under-16 social media ban? It\u2019s real, passed late 2024, and fines companies millions if kids sneak on. Your digital life\u2019s their playground.\n\n* Excessive Regulatory Control: Regulation\u2019s a cancer here\u2014start a caf\u00e9, and you\u2019re buried in health codes, labor laws, and tax hoops that\u2019d make a saint snap. Construction\u2019s a nightmare; in Victoria, you need 20+ permits just to build a shed. Even fishing\u2019s regulated\u2014catch a marlin without a license, and it\u2019s a $500 fine. The bureaucracy\u2019s a bloated leech, sucking ambition dry while innovation rots in line for approval.\n\n* Oppressive Taxation Structure: Taxes hit like a sledgehammer\u2014personal income tops out at 45% over $190,000, and the middle class gets reamed with a 32.5% rate from $45,000. It\u2019s all to fund welfare and \u201cequality\u201d schemes, like the $20 billion yearly social security tab that props up loafers. GST adds 10% to every purchase, and small businesses choke on payroll taxes. It\u2019s legalized robbery to keep the lazy afloat.\n\nThere are way more other aspects that I cannot think of for now since I do not own a property or land here but I believe the regulations are quite significant.  \n  \nAfter doing some research, I found that almost all UK-ish commonwealth countries have a potential to become a police state. Just sharing some of my rant here. Please feel free to discuss your opinions. I might just leave the country after my degree.",

Cops can demand ID for no reason and you have to comply, can pull you over for no reason other than they feel like it, can order you to move on for no reason, etc.\n\nAlso cant emphasize enough how over the top and backwards our policies on drug enforcement are.\n\nAs an Australian who has looked into other countries to move to that are less oppressive the best I've come across is the Czech Republic or some states in the US.",

If you don't like one state you can simply move to another, states vary significantly since they have quite different laws from state to state unlike a commonwealth nation, and this could leave you some unintended luck in the future. Plus getting there is easy as an Aussie (Green card lottery, E3 Australia specialty), which could solve a lot of unnecessary hassle. Also you got lots of choices in terms of different weather whether you prefer a cold, hot, dry or wet. Just a personal suggestion from my perspective mate.",

Australians portray themselves as carefree larrikans but in reality are a pretty whiney \u2018stay in your lane\u2019 bunch.\n\nSome clarifications though:\n\nGuns - There is a pervasive misconception that you can\u2019t have guns in Australia. I moved to Australia and own guns. It isn\u2019t that hard to get them provided you aren\u2019t some nutjob. I don\u2019t really mind that I can\u2019t buy an AR15, this is a bizarre hill that a lot of libertarians are willing to die on.\n\nBusiness regulation - is actually pretty lax compared to other places I\u2019ve set up businesses, specifically in industries like financial services and tech. It takes 20 minutes to set up a business in Australia.\n\nCastle Laws - as another commenter mentioned, there is no overarching law, but is more at the judges discretion. Based on my understanding of the law in the state I live, I would be comfortable defending myself by and my family from a violent intruder. There are many recent examples of a \u2018little angel\u2019 being stopped in the act.\n\nWith that said, the state has been creeping more and more, to the point where I am somewhat uncomfortable - especially at tax time. Australians enjoy a quality of life far superior to most places, and have sadly allowed their government to strip liberties as a trade off.\u00a0",

I have more experience in NZ and it seems like folks are pretty free economically to do what they want. The \"Crackdowns\" on guns and speech and stuff don't really affect the normal day to day lives of people. I've had a buddy say he could never live there because of the lack of access to guns and kiwi friends who say they could never live in the US because of all the guns, it's kind of ironic how it works. \n\nI don't feel unsafe in the US, but I did recently travel to Japan and I was just blown away by how \"safe\" it felt. Even from just petty crime, folks just don't steal there.

I was pointing out that these general emotional things matter to us as humans much more than abstract things.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your specific experience. But that doesn't change the fact that Australia in terms of violent crime is much safer than the US. \n\nAnd that has value.",

Family Law and Child Custody: Bias in favor of mothers in custody arrangements under the Family Law Act 1975, where fathers are denied equal access to children post-separation.\n2. Domestic Violence Policies: Focus on women as primary victims in laws like Victoria\u2019s Family Violence Protection Act 2008 and funding (e.g., $925 million for the Leaving Violence Program), sidelining male victims.\n3. Gender Equality Programs: Initiatives like the National Strategy for Gender Equality and Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, prioritizing women\u2019s advancement while ignoring men\u2019s issues.\n4. Paid Parental Leave: Policies (e.g., 20 weeks leave in 2023) favor women due to higher uptake, reinforcing traditional roles and limiting men\u2019s caregiving opportunities.\n5. Workplace Gender Quotas and Reporting: Requirements for gender equity reporting and pressure for female hires, discriminating against men in the workplace.\n6. Violence Against Women Funding: Significant allocations (e.g., $2 billion in 2022-23 budget) for women\u2019s safety programs, neglecting male victims of violence.\n7. Legal Accountability: Leniency toward women in domestic violence or family law cases, while men are disproportionately vilified or presumed guilty.\n8. Public Narrative and Stereotypes: Government campaigns and rhetoric portraying men as perpetrators and women as victims, ignoring male struggles like mental health or suicide rates.\n9. Education and Employment Opportunities: Programs targeting women in STEM or leadership roles, excluding and disadvantaging men.\n10. Men\u2019s Health and Support Services: Underfunding or lack of focus on male-specific issues (e.g., prostate cancer, suicide prevention) compared to women\u2019s health initiatives.",
