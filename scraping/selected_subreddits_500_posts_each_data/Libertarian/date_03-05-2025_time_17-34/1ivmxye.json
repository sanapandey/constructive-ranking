That's the slowest part of TSA, the actual viewing of the bag images. The next is them checking IDs and taking a picture.... Both these jobs can and will be replaced by AI just checking cameras. Realistically, TSA should just be standing there for when a human forgets to take off their belt and sets off the people scanner. Or heaven forbid their real purpose pops up and someone is trying to smuggle onboard something more illicit. Lines will go much faster, and TSA will need at least 2 less people per scanner.",

Simply blowing up a plane is not much worse in terms of fatalities than blowing up a train, concert or football stadium, so it makes no sense to have much stricter security on airports than train stations.\n\nAirport security doesn't really reduce terrorism. If airport security gets actually efficient, terrorists will simply kill people elsewhere.
