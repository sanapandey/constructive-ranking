That begs the question, which ones should be kept, and which ones should not?",

You can sell cigarettes and alcohol even though both of those things are literal poison and even come with labels telling you they are.\n\nIt's not up to someone else to tell me what I can sell, or you what you can put in your body.\n\nThe only proper rights are negative rights. This basically means that everyone can do whatever they want so long as they're not engaging in things like murder, rape, fraud, theft, arson, enslavement, assault, etc.\n\nIn fact, you could even do that stuff (you can even today in any settlement on earth), but it's incumbent on good people to punish and detur it.",
