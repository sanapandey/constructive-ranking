And every libertarian should do their best to protect those who can't help themselves against much more powerful evil people. Because in a world where libertarianism is seen as an ideaologly that only benefits a small privileged, lucky, and self-centered minority, tyrants will have a very easy time convincing the majority that their only hope for a better life is to submit to the will of evil politican and ignore their ethics and morality when they are asked to hurt free people. \n\nI don't demand that you pay or fight for Ukraine. And i will respect your right to criticize Ukraine and those who use taxation or conscription to help Ukraine. But I will condemn you for trying to normalise imperialistic practices in African and recommending it to be used in other places in a libertarian sub.",

The policy America has in Africa doesn't benefit average Americans. It may very well have hurt average Americans because when an African gets radicalized or become a pawn of great power games, they will be much more likely to hurt average Amercians than the rulling Amercians who may have played a direct or indirect role in political instabilities of Africa.\n\nThere are plenty of countries that maintained a netrual policy toward the war. Many of them didn't try to justify it or legitimise what was going on. They didn't claim one side was on the right side and the other was on the wrong. I wouldn't say what they did was moral, but it was tolerable. What Trump is doing is blatantly taking sides, making threats, and saying provably false things because his ego was hurt.\n\nTrump says Russia had the right to invade Ukraine because Ukraine was communicating threatening things. If you agree with that, do you recognize that Trump making threats against Ukraine may also result in Ukrainians retaliating against the US? And do you understand that your average radiclized Ukrainian, many of whom having lost their home and becoming jobless due to Russian invasion, are probably a lot more likely to hurt innocent average Amercians than Trump? All because Trump couldn't keep his mouth shut and not say things that don't help the Ukrainian peace process?\n\nIf you don't feel the obligation to stop or pervert injustice unless it concerns you personally, then you don't have morality. You only have interests. You have the right not to have morality, and as much as I dislike it, I would still not allow someone to punish you simply for having an incorrect moral system, and will try to help you or hurt your hypothetical oppressors, even though I don't expect you to do jackshit if me or someone else is being oppressed, but that's what it means to have moral values. \"Treating others as you would like to be treated\" and all that.",
