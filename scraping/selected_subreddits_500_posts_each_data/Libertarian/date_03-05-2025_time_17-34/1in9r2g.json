Trump, like most other recent presidents before him, is unacceptably consolidating power into the executive branch, he's just doing it faster than the presidents before him.\n\nMake no mistake, Trump does not represent the type of small government and self-autonomy that is at the essence of this political philosophy. And yet Dave Smith constantly engages in Trump apologetics.",

I'm thankful for seat belts to keep us safe in case of a  car crash, but I would prefer not getting into a crash in the first place. \n\nTrump took the wheel and is driving as fast as he can go. Previous drivers found it unimaginable to drive this aggressively because it was important for passengers not to experience a bumpy ride. With Trump all of that is out the window and wants to see how much HP the car really has. I'm really hoping the seat belt is strong enough to keep us safe in case of a crash.",

Maybe those down-voters don't understand that. My point is, I understand those to be executive branch functions. The OMB is an Executive Branch office. The executive branch is constitutionally responsible and accountable to Congress to issue traceable payment but it must be fully consistent with law and with an approved budget. That's where the responsibility for audit and for making payment come from. We seem to have, to a greater or lesser extent, departments and agencies that have written checks (through delegation of authority from the POTUS) but don't have a sufficiently tight accountability feedback loop. The EB ultimately holds the checkbook - but does not have unilateral and unlimited power of the purse. And as for any business or individual, if you are authorized to write checks, you better damn well be prepared to balance the checkbook at the end of the month. Now Trump, DOGE and Elon come along and finally and thankfully are opening the checkbooks and insisting upon full and complete accountability, as they ought. Time to tighten up - there's a new sheriff in town!",
