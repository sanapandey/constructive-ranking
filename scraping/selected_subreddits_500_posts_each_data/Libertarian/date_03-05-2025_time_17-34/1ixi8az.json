Heck, groups like the KKK and Hell's Angels exist because they're legal. Some of the activities said groups might do might be illegal. But the existence of the groups themselves are legal. So accusing me of being a fed doesn't make any sense. Plus my account isn't new. I have posts that are a few years old talking about my situation that I'm in, asking for legal advice about my situation. So just read through my post history and comment history if you're suspicious of me lol.",

I think sometimes it's just a playful joke or sarcasm and I think sometimes people are genuinely suspicious. But I don't understand it. I mean there's billions of people in the world, millions in the United States. Sure, some posts could be a fed and some posts are definitely from genuine people. I mean you can't tell me I'm the only person that has the questions and curiosity that I have. I'm sure there are several ordinary people who wants to know about militias and similar groups.\n\nAnd here's the thing. Organizing groups is LEGAL. The activities of certain groups might be illegal. But the existence of the groups themselves are NOT illegal. Feds might keep tabs on certain groups just to catch them doing illegal activities but they can't do anything about groups existing. And there's nothing illegal about the group idea I have. Just a civilian defense force to protect communities from bad people and from crooked cops and to protect against a tyrannical government should it ever come to that. None of that is illegal. I was also thinking the group I have in mind would conceal carry everywhere to protect against mass shootings and potential criminals. We need to protect each other and our communities and each other's communities. I thought libertarians would be interested in such an idea.",

Also, don't be afraid to cuss lol. Free speech, dude. It's okay to say fuck (unless you have religious convictions against it and just don't wanna say it lol).\n\nI'm not gonna comment on what you said about violence (in case the feds are watching/reading). I'm not a fan of violence personally (I'm not just saying that for the feds, I really am not a fan of violence or confrontation). Plus you don't want a civilian defense force to be taken as a terrorist organization nor do you want to risk innocent lives (lives you are meant to protect). By the way, wouldnt your idea about violence violate the NAP?\n\nWhat I had in mind was a militia that would conceal carry everywhere (or open carry if allowed) to prevent  mass shootings and other would-be/potential criminals. And a militia that would put the fear of God in abusers such as rapists, etc. and crooked cops. I have other ideas for the group but I don't want to say too much right now unless I'm talking to someone who's seriously interested in the idea and as long as I know they're not a fed. (Only reason a cop would be against my idea anyway though, is if they're one of those cops who beats their wives or commits sex crimes, or if they're a fascist power-tripping/power hungry cop but there's probably more of those types than anyone likes to acknowledge or admit). My group idea is about protecting communities and people, not committing senseless violence to push political ideology or some agenda. I also want the group to be apolitical or politically neutral, so not another \"right-wing group\" and not a \"left-wing group\" either.",

This ideology is anti-capitalist and its acts involve physical aggression or extreme sabotage against companies, or potential targets of anti-capitalism, vandalism, etc. The root of left-libertarianism is Marxism, although they are not necessarily Marxists and disagree on their approach to the State.\n\n\n\nLeft-libertarianism is still socialism. Every anti-capitalist ideology without exception is in favor of plundering at some level, some more and some less, so I can assure you that they fit into the category of \"socialists\", and therefore \"terrorists\".\n\n  \nAbout the militia, I think the members opinion dont matter, it would be a private security company yk?",

Even if the government's laws say that this is allowed and legitimate, and therefore legitimize socialism, democrats and progressives, it is still no different from terrorism, even if only morally speaking. I am not saying that this hypothetical militia should kill leftists, of course not, but rather prevent them from raising crowds to endorse this bloodthirsty ideology and perpetuate this genocidal discourse.\n\nIf shooting an invader on my property is legitime, contain leftie crowds are too.",
