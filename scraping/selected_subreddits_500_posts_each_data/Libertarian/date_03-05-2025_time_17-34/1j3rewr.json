Employees pay that same money as part of their total compensation package... \n\nLastly if you're paying as much in social security taxes as you do in income taxes, you're doing it wrong...",

Your \"super\" retirement plan can be managed by the individual, but I don't know how much investing freedom is given because I'm not Australian. But at the end of the day, it is an individual retirement account unlike the Ponzi scheme that Social Security works on.",
