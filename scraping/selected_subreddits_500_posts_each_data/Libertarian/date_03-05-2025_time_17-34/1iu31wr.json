Insulting or defaming anybody is illegal here.   \nI think it's a stupid law but it's not just some tool to silence critics of politicians.   \nI have a hard time not insulting people in public and I had the pleasure of being charged with insulting people twice already. Once it was my neighbor and then some gardener in traffic that I told to get off the road if he was too \"redacted\" to drive. \n\nSo yeah. Shit law but you can freely criticize any politician publicly. The only limitation is pretty much that you cannot use insulting language.   \n  \nOkay: \"Robert Habeck is an incompetent leader and he should stick to writing  books for children\"  \nNot okay: Calling him an imbecile.",

I only say this because american media is talking about it like this is basically china or north korea which it is not. \nMany countries including america are limiting free speech. Ignoring the fact that there is different levels of quality to repression is just stupid. \n\nPersonal honor is valued here. This law doesn\u2018t exist to protect the ones on power but every member of society.\n\nThere are much more problematic limits to free speech here than that. Like for example blasphemy is illegal under certain circumstances. And that is actually a law that is only there to protect the ones in power (the church) and is now also being abused by radical muslims trying to silence everyone that is critical of their death cult.",
