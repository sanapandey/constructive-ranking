We laid out how Bush's uses of EOs were the beginning of something horrible. We knew then some day would come a president who would absolutely abuse them . Yes, Obama used them incorrectly as well with drone strikes and more. We rang that bell too. Biden used them as well. \n\nAt the end of the day EOs are not how our executive branch was ever made to function. \n\nThe abuse happening now is unparalleled in our lifetime and can't not be ignored.  \n\nNow to the TDS.\n\nI don't know how old you are but hear me now. Donald Trump has been in my entire life. Way before he got into politics, he was known as nothing but a con-man begging for attention.  Nothing has changed. If you listed the 7 deadly sins he'd be the ultimate personification of every single one. For people not to see that or to call that TDS. That's some amazing mental gymnastics you got there.",
