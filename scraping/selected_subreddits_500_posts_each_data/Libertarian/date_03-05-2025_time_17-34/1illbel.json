While they both store value, neither are as widely used as fiat money and so don't really fit the definition of 'medium of exchange.'\n\nMises\u2019 Regression Theorem explains that money emerges from commodities that already had value as goods.  Gold was used as jewelry but Bitcoin hasn't been used which will complicate it's transformation.\n\nWhile some claim that bitcoin is money, most bitcoiners don't actually spend it.  Probably because they are just waiting for the value to go up before selling and transforming it into fiat money.",
