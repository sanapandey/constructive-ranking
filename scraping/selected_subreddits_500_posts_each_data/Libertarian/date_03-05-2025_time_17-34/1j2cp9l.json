If you look at how far from the middle new construction is taking place in Greenville SC is way different than Los Angeles. No one in Greenville is commuting an hour to get to their job in the city, however that's not uncommon in LA.\n\nSo \"in\" these centers is limited because it's usually so over developed that a new building project is typically removing something with added cost there so it will be a very niche high value building.\n\nFurther away from the center will be new build projects at a lower overall cost.",

No where in the post does it imply that there isn\u2019t a housing crisis.\n\nThe post demonstrates that the **housing crisis can be solved with more housing supply**.\n\nExcessive government building regulations, inflation, environmental regulations, and zoning laws make housing construction difficult and expensive.  \n\nThe consumer\u2014renters and homebuyers\u2014ends up paying for it through high rents and lower home ownership rates.",

In the LCOL small city I live in right now, there are at least a half dozen empty homes on my street alone. This isn't uncommon either; pull up zillow punch in say a 3-bed minimum, with a max of $100k / min of $50k, and look at the tens of thousands of single family, stick built homes that are actively for sale right now. \n\nThere is however, a serious housing issue in a handful of cities that have stifled expansion, and saddled developers with endless red tape.\n\nThis is coupled with a new era of thinking where people with jobs that have employment opportunities nationwide, and could relocate to an area with a lower cost of living where there are both jobs and affordable homes, flat out refuse to move. Even to the point of refusing to move to a lower cost of living city within the same metro area.\n\nSo as a result, we have a serious bifurcation in the US when it comes to housing. Some areas the cost of housing is spiraling out of control, where in other areas affordable homes sit empty and rot into the ground because people refuse to move there.",

If time on market is only a month or so, that means they're all being used, there's just high turnover. If they're all sitting unsold for upwards of a year, that means there's an actual problem.\n\nDon't forget that older or badly-built homes might need renovation before they can be lived in, which adds a lot to the cost beyond just the sale price.",

The point still stands that there are thousands of available, affordable homes in the United States that people in HCOL of living areas could move to right now if they so chose. Like in the range of a couple being able to buy both working full time making minimum wage.\n\nJust for whatever reason now, many people are instead deciding to stay put, pay an exorbitant amount of rent, resign themselves to never achieving the American dream, and then complain about it instead of changing anything.\n\nThis isn't some BS theoretical thing either. I'm in my mid 30s, and typing this from one of the spare bedrooms I turned into an office in my paid off house because I did exactly what I'm advocating for right now.
