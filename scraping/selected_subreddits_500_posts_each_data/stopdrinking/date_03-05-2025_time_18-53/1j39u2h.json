I\u2019m also grateful for all of you who have helped this alcoholic stay sober one day at a time these last two months. My life today is not perfect and neither am I. But it\u2019s so much better. I\u2019m so much better today! I did not believe I would be able to do this 2 months ago. I do now. IWNDWYT!\n",
