    "selftext": "Does anyone else have drinking related dreams? I've been AF for 66 days now and in the beginning I kept dreaming that I had fell into old habits, drinking and screwing things up. I'd wake up in a panic and think about who I needed to apologise to and then realising I hadn't actually drank and I was so relieved. Last night I dreamt I went on a works do in a pub and had a Guinness 0% so that was ok! Haha",

But it does sometimes make me wonder if I've *really* gone this long without a drink... like I gaslight myself into wondering if I did sneak one in there and I'm choosing not to remember. But nope.
