Had my son\u2019s first birthday party and my father\u2019s funeral this week, boy did I want a drink! Didn\u2019t cave  though. Next stop 90 days!\n \nOne of the few things I\u2019ve learned, stopping drinking isn\u2019t a magic wand. Everything isn\u2019t better all of a sudden because you stop drinking, but things suck better sober. IWNDWYT ",

I think grief might be the hardest.  \n\nI sometimes worry about widowhood, and because my wife has some significant health problems, it's quite possible.  But I have a fair amount of faith that I'll be able to endure it should it come along because I've met at least a dozen other recovered alcoholics who have endured such grief and they've come out the other side of it sober.  Sorry for your loss there \u2665.\n\n\nN\ud83e\uddca! ^N\ud83e\uddca! ^^N\ud83e\uddca! ^^^N\ud83e\uddca! ^^^^N\ud83e\uddca!",
