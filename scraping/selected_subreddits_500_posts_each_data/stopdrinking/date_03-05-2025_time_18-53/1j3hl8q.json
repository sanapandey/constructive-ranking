    "selftext": "Today marks 2 years sober.  I could not have done it without all of you here in this subreddit.  From the failures to the successes, I have learned from all of you.  Each person\u2019s journey is different.  Some share the same traumas, triggers, loneliness, social anxiety, and stress but each journey is our own.  \nI am not confident in saying that I will never have a relapse.  Too many of us (alcoholics) with multiple years of sobriety have at some point crashed and gave in to old habits.  I will say it is still a daily choice that I make to no longer drink.   \nWe are all one step away from our former self.  \n\nThanks to ALL of you\n\nIWNDWYT \n",
