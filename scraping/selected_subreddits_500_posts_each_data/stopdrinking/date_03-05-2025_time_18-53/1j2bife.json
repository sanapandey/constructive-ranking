    "selftext": "i (27f) am a functioning alcoholic and i\u2019m 9 days sober from alcohol today. from oct 2023 to feb 2025, i drank almost every single day. what really made me stop was accidentally getting too drunk with my boyfriends parents and not remembering 80% of what happened and then throwing up on the side of the freeway. a week after that, i had my last drink. \n\nit\u2019s only been 9 days, but the difference in how i feel emotionally and physically is insane. the first 3 days were awful. i didn\u2019t sleep much, woke up with night sweats and had lots of anxiety. my sleep has improved so much too. i\u2019ve had the best sleep these past 5 days than the past couple of months combined. i was so emotional and cried for 2 days straight for \u201cno reason\u201d last weekend. i used to think i drank because i was bored but really i drank because of my anxiety. i felt anxious this weekend and my first thought was \u201ci wanna get drunk\u201d. luckily i didn\u2019t. i\u2019ve also had this weird shoulder/arm pain for the past few months and convinced myself i was just sleeping weird but the pain has stopped since i quit drinking. overall, i just feel so alive and present. \n\ni am a functioning alcoholic and no one in my life knows what\u2019s going on. my boyfriend knows i have a drinking problem but does not know the extent of what it actually is. he noticed something was up when i almost finished a bottle of tequila alone during a 3 day trip together (i lied and said i accidentally spilled it). i was/am very good at hiding it. no one has suspected anything. so i\u2019m sharing all of this online because i just need to tell someone and i don\u2019t want to worry anyone. i know i can do this on my own. and during my sleepless nights, i would read through this subreddit. i\u2019ve been wanting to quit since november and i\u2019m finally going strong. \n\nthank you tor reading. \n\nEDIT: coming back to this 24 hours later, thank you so much for all the wonderful messages. feeling hopeful. glad for this community.

It was actually a dinner with my parents that was my breaking point- no one else got drunk except me. It was weird and embarrassing. I think the partners know a lot more than they let on. Let\u2019s do this together \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udcab\nPs, try get your flair sorted, it\u2019s really motivating!",

I think he knows but because I carry on with daily life like normal he doesn\u2019t really make a big deal about it. Kudos to you for taking a huge step. I\u2019ve tried to go clean but by day 2 I usually caved in and head to the liquor store.",
