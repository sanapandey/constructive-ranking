            "body": "anxiety when you get sober is a real thing. your body is in haywire mode and is adjusting. I have chronic OCD and a lot of my obsessions are around health. When i first got sober i was in your shoes. what helped me a lot was looking into the science of quitting and the effect it has on your mental health. your dopamine receptors are f*d and your body has no idea what to do when you take away the thing you\u2019re using to mask anxiety - you\u2019re really left on the frontlines! \n\nI\u2019m back in early sobriety too, but i\u2019ve been here before and can combat these anxious thoughts when they come up. i just remind myself, this is a chemical reaction happening in my brain because i\u2019ve taken away the one thing that suppressed my anxiety. now i\u2019ve got to deal with it head on. it\u2019s a good thing at the end of the day because it\u2019s building healthy coping mechanisms (much better than reaching for the bottle). \n\ni\u2019d recommend reaching out to a counsellor / therapist if you don\u2019t have one. in no way am i diagnosing you but it sounds quite similar to what i deal with. even just to chat through your anxiety and get some reassurance. \n\ngood luck, you\u2019re going to be okay!",

I've got therapy lined up, they just want a bit more time sober before they step in but I have SMART meetings, the GP and my local D&A service while I wait",
