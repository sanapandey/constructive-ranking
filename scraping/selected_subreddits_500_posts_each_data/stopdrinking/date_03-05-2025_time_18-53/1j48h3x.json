    "selftext": "First off I wanna say this is my first time posting to the sub, Reddit, not sure this will help anybody, but I needed to get my words out. \n\nI am currently 165 days sober and about three weeks out from getting my six 6 month chip. \n\nAnyways, onto the main point of this post, last night I had a very vivid dream about drinking. \n\nIt was nothing to crazy, but scenario of the dream I was just hanging out with an old foreman and a couple old coworkers.\n\n( guys I used to drink heavily with after work and during work) \n\nSo anyways in the dream we started chatting and it feels random, but somehow a pint of vodka was in my pocket, and I just started drinking it during the dream, and even in the dream I felt the shame and disgusted with myself.\n\nI remember feeling buzzed in the dream, and that shit freaked me the fuck out and I don\u2019t know if it was either my dog  that woke me up or I freaked out myself out so much in the dream that I woke myself up, but when I came to from the dream, I still felt that weird buzz when you first take your sip of alcohol, and I don\u2019t know if anyone has experienced that level of body symptom from just a dream. \n\n\nThis is the third dream about drinking  I have had when becoming sober, has anyone else had this before? I know I\u2019m not that far into sobriety, but I so tried of having dreams like this! \n\nAnd before I  end this post I just want to say I feel like I realize I didn\u2019t drink until I was cleaning up my dog shit at 4 AM, and I said to myself \u201coh shit that was just a dream that was fucking crazy\u201d\n\nIf you made to the end of the post, thank you for reading and I will not drink with you today \u2764\ufe0f",
