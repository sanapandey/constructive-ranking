    "selftext": "Today marks three years since I desperately resolved (again) to stop drinking once and for all. I\u2019ll never forget the feeling of pouring yet another drink late at night, hoping this next one would numb me enough that I would feel better, knowing it probably wouldn\u2019t, but not having any idea what else to do. Nor the horrible feeling of knowing once again that I\u2019d overdone it and would be throwing up again all night, wanting to stop the cycle but knowing I couldn\u2019t. Glad to be here with you all.",
