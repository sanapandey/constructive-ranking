    "selftext": "I stopped drinking 7 years ago as of January 26th. Last night, I was at my older brother's house and he had recently gotten sober. I asked him why he was drinking beer and he told me it was a non alcoholic one because he likes the taste and poured me about a quarter cup. I smelled it. Yep, smells like beer. I tasted it, yup, tastes like beer. \n\nThen right after the first sip I got a huge rush of anxiety. I haven't had anxiety like that since prior to quitting. It's like every nerve in my body fired at once and I had to step out for a minute to calm down. Even knowing it was non-alcoholic didn't help. I could down the entire case and not feel a buzz. It didn't matter and it felt like a full-body rejection of what I was doing. On the one hand, I was embarrassed, I used to drink a few 40s a day, now one little sip sends me over the edge? \n\nOn the other hand I was kinda thankful that I reacted the way I did. It felt like I was making a massive mistake. Has anyone else ever had something similar happen with them? ",

It was a \u201cme\u201d thing for sure, and I envied those who could use NA beers like you describe. \n\nSince starting Naltrexone/the Sinclair method this is now how I\u2019m starting to feel with actual beer. I never thought I\u2019d see the day. The cravings for alcohol have significantly dissipated, and it is so easy to have only one beer at trivia, then switch to a NA seltzer or whatever, because the beer is an unpleasant feeling (\u201cdizzy juice\u201d as I\u2019ve heard others call it). Going to try to start off with a NA beer next time to see if I have broken out of the mindset of \u201cneeding\u201d a beer to feel social/fun.\n\nSorry for the tangent, I\u2019m just happy that the program is working and your comment made me remember my previous hangups with NA beers and made me realize that this is something worth revisiting, because it might have changed now, and the goal is to stop drinking entirely.\n\nI know Naltrexone doesn\u2019t work well for everyone, but I absolutely think it\u2019s worth a try for anyone struggling with changing their relationship with alcohol. It removes the euphoric feelings of alcohol, so you are just left with more of the physical effects, which aren\u2019t great without the euphoria, so you stop getting the \u201creward\u201d from drinking, making it less desirable, and slowly but surely eliminating the cravings. It\u2019s been 3 weeks and I have gone from 4 drinks minimum a night during the week, countless during the weekend, to 0-1 max a night during the week, and only 2 this past weekend, despite going and visiting a bunch of old friends, a trip that normally would be a countless number of drinks experience. It was just as fun if not more so because I didn\u2019t feel like shit and my mind was right - no anxiety, no hangover, no regrets from how I acted, and I was thinking clearly and snappy in conversation since I wasn\u2019t bogged down by those negative effects. \n\nWhile it\u2019s still a work in progress, I am loving the trend. I fully feel that I will successfully become sober with this program, and I just hope others who are struggling will try it. I feel like I\u2019m getting my life back.",

I mean, let's face it: alcohol tastes terrible. And it should, as it's literally poison. When we start drinking, most of us start on beer because the alcohol content is the lowest of the alcohol drinks we have access too, and the stronger stuff is just too horrible to keep down when we are newbies to booze. (Some kids drink Nyquil though instead of beer but for similar reasons and I guess Nyquil has some other drug in it.)\n\nIt usually takes time to train our brains to associate the taste of poisonous alcohol the with the euphoric buzz affects that comes with deadening effect it has our brain cells, and to override our body's natural reaction to drinking poison -- spitting that shit out. Eventually though we start thinking \"Hey this actually tastes good! I am enjoying the experience of drinking this substance!\"\n\nI don't see any reason to go back to drinking fake beer or wine. I don't want to drink things that suggest there is something beneficial to drinking booze and it's a sad affair that I don't drink any more. It's the opposite - I'm free of an addiction. I want my taste buds to behave in the healthy way they are supposed to when confronted with poison -- before I was tricked into the alcohol trap as a teenager, many decades ago.",

But they had several NA choices, plus some hop water that tasted awful. My bill was $50 just for me...don't miss it. Then we went to some other \"girls on stage dancing(not a strip bar)\" place where they had only one NA option. I had probably 4-5 of them. Also I was with two other guys who didn't drink and we'd buy NA beers for each other like the old days. So weird. And then we left, while the drinkers stayed. I was in bed when I got a group text about them being in uber and one of they guys has passed out, so they made fun of him. \n\nIs NA beer safe? No. It's too close to the real thing in terms of flavor and the ritual. It still has 0.5% ABV, and not all brains work the same. Luckily it's not enough for my brain to start obsessing over it. But I did think about getting more NA beer for the weekend. Which was a red flag for me, so I didn't. \n\nNA beer was created by \"big alcohol\" to still keep us on the hook, giving them money. They probably have corporate meetings where they discuss how they can get us to buy more or even relapse and go for the real thing. I just see NA beer as unnecessary beverage that resembles a destructive substance. It's like soda, not really good for me (at least mentally), and there are better options to quench thirst. And the only reason I will justify it is because I am in fact an alcoholic and will find a reason to hang on to the last resemblance of what I was in love with. \n\nIWNDWYT",

Glad to read about pasturing though. I want to try athletic. I\u2019ve tried heini and a few in Japan one Sapporo and one called \u201call free\u201d which made me smile. I only drink one with a meal. I liked the taste of good beer. As stated already to each their own and always proceed with caution in your own sobriety!",

I would use CBD cigarettes instead of tobacco. It would allow me to go through the same motions of smoking without getting any nicotine. I wasn't a huge fan of the CBD cigarettes so it was easy to stop using them. But I had a pack just in case I got a strong craving to light up. Now, I don't need to do that.

In some situations, like a wedding or watching football, it just makes sense to me. I don\u2019t feel so out of place or like something is missing. Other people don\u2019t need or like the reminder.\n\nI can totally get how an NA beer could be triggering for some people, luckily that doesn\u2019t happen to me. I think its also important to remember that they\u2019re not entirely alcohol free. NA beer just has to have less than .5% abv so technically having 10 could be like having one real beer. You have to be comfortable with this.\n\nI actually wrote something about this not too long ago if you\u2019re interested. It was on my mind at the moment because there are a lot of different, and heavy, opinions about NA beers inside the rooms. \nhttps://quitandconquer.com/na-beer/",
