    "selftext": "I'm 33 started drinking at 19 pretty infrequently. I would say around 25 it turned into an almost every weekend thing as I got older it went from every weekend to adding in a day during the week here and there. I was very depressed around 3 years ago and got to the point where I was having 6-9 tall boys a night on the weekdays and 12-18 Saturday nights, usually wouldn't drink Sundays. I met my fiance during this period and cleaned myself up for about 2 years I would only drink occasionally and wouldn't go overboard with it. I have severe sleep apnea which has been untreated my whole life. Around 6 months ago I started the process of getting that taken care of. Between the stress of that and work I allowed myself to fall back into my old ways. Started out every Friday and then every Friday and Saturday for about the last 4 months it's been at least 6 days a week where I'm drinking a minimum of 9 tall boys it's rare that I go over 12 but does happen. I function very well during the day still rarely suffer from any hangover that people notice, my fiance doesn't even know the extent of it, I realized she doesn't know the extent because I've been just automatically doing the things I used to so that she wouldn't know. She knows how often I'm drinking beer but just thinks it's a couple a night, I've never outright lied to her but it is a lie by omission.  \n\n  \nAll of that being said I'm done I will not drink tonight. I have not went more than 2 days without it in the last 6 months I've not experienced any harsh withdrawals in those days just some irritability and problems sleeping. Although I am productive in my work life I'm completely drained in every other aspect of my life unless I'm having some beers. That isn't fair to her or myself. I know that I can do this I have one main trigger that I'm worried about. My small group of friends we don't get to see each other much anymore so we make time at least 1 night if not 2 per week to play online games together. I've gotten in such a habit of knocking them back while doing this that the last time I tried to play with them sober I got about an hour in and made a beer run apart from just skipping time with the boys does anyone have a similar trigger and strategy to not succumb?
