    "selftext": "I had a dui 2 year ago. I will be able to buy a car next month or the month after; since my dui I have graduated lessened my alchool consumption.\n\nI drink maybe once or twice a month. I can drink one-two beer and stop. But last time I went out I let myself go and drank enough to be drunk knowing I migth be allergic to alchool now.\n\nAm I addicted ? Do I have a problem ?\n\nIdk anymore",

            "body": "I went through a period of a couple years where I was careening out of control, and I finally got arrested on an assault charge in 2019. That was a major wakeup call -- didn't recognize the person I had become, swore to myself that I was going to get sober after that... and you know what? I did. Then about a year later, I convinced myself that a celebratory glass of champagne couldn't do any harm... In 2021, 2 years after my arrest, I felt that I had successfully achieved moderation and was fine.\n\nBy the summer of 2022 I was drinking on a daily basis again, and it wasn't until 2 years later that I was able to admit my problem had fully returned and I was on a bad path again. So, personally, I'd encourage anyone to not make that same mistake... but I also know that nobody could have convinced me along the way; I had to run the experiment for myself. Just glad it didn't end with another arrest or a DUI.\n\nPut it this way: What could go wrong if you choose not to keep drinking? What could go wrong if you do choose to keep drinking? Which version of yourself are you more likely to end up being happy with?\n\nI think too many people (myself included) spend too much time wondering if they have a problem that warrants quitting, and not enough time wondering about the benefits of quitting regardless of whether or not they have a problem.",

It is more complicated than that. \n\nI really recommend reading books like Alcohol Explained, This naked Mind, and never Enough to understand what alcohol really does to your brain and identify problematic patterns. \n\nIn my opinion, if you find yourself in situations where you regret your actions and it is related to alcohol..., you have something to consider. Even if you don't have a full blown alcohol use disorder, is alcohol serving you? Does it make your life better or does it take away from it?",
