    "selftext": "I made a post last week about how awful I felt since I drank way too much on my night off and spent my whole day sick. I\u2019m happy to say that I have off work today and spent last night in bed with my cat, drinking a cup of tea and relaxing while playing games in my tablet. I felt so refreshed waking up and have had a productive day off so far! It\u2019s always so worth it not drinking and I need to remember this feeling when I get the temptation again. ",
