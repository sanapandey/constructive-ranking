    "selftext": "That was in October, I think?\n\nI say I think because that one beer turned into me not having more than a week sober since then and my brain is scrambled.\n\n23 years old and have struggled with addictions of every kind since I was 18. For the first time in my adult life I had everything kicked for over half a year, I felt stable. Bored, but stable. All it took was someone asking me to bring beer to a gathering and suddenly I'm at home drinking before I go to this dinner because just one won't hurt will it ?\n\nJust one, just fucking one. I can't believe it. In the months following I have lost it. I went back to smoking, binge eating, even using stimulants.\n\nAll of this shit was set in motion by a moment of weakness. \n\nSo I'm starting again today. The millionth day one. ",

Something about that 6 month mark brings about that \"I can have just one now\". I did it enough times that I realized I can't actually have just the one.\n\nThe important thing, right now, is to not be too hard on yourself. Relapse happens. Nobody in this world ever succeeded without failing a few times (in my case, many times). In every failure is a lesson, and sometimes it takes hitting the bottom enough times for it to be learned. It's important to remember that if you made it that far before, you can do it again. Accept the past and use it as a reminder of where you want to be and where you don't want to be.",

Saving money.\n\nWell my side hustle has been gaining more and more traction and I got invited to a networking party thing at a wine bar. At first I wasn't going to go, but at the last second I decided that it was the best opportunity I've had in a long time to get some networking done. I had to at least go and scope it out. I wasn't worried about wanting a drink, but I knew it was going to be kinda awkward since I hadn't done something like that in many years.\n\nWell once I was there and everyone had a glass of wine in their hand I started considering the \"just one to blend in\" thing. I actually went so far as to ask the bartender if they had any kinda NA drinks and he looked at me like I was crazy and said no. I sipped on water while trying to network and dipped outta there.\n\nI've fallen for the \"just one\" trap so many times before. I know how it always turns out and I was **still** really tempted that night.",
