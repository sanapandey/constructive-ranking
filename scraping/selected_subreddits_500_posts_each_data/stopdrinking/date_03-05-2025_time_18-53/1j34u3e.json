    "selftext": "Good morning. Yesterday, our teenage kid really disappointed us as we found out we've been badly lied on (again!). After a lot of arguing, my better half and I spent another two sleepless hours thinking about what we might have done wrong and how to help that kid develop some responsibility.\nThis was the first time in several weeks that I had a strong craving for alcohol. My brain told me \"If you want to have at least a bit of rest and comfort, have a beer. Otherwise you'd be overthinking all night long\". I didn't give in and eventually fell asleep, but it's exactly situations like this that used to catch me off guard, where this inner voice tells me \"you work hard, you're stressed, of course you deserve a drink - and you don't have to drink too much, just enough to relax you\".\nBeing left sober with the thought that there's so much in work, in the household and with family that I just don't manage to finish (be it because of lack of time or lack of energy) sometimes is really difficult. I really have to find a healthier \"escape\"\nAnyway, IWNDWYT",
