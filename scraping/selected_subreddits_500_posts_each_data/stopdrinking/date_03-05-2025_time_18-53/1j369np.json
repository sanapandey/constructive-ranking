    "selftext": "I just want to rant about this for a bit.\n\n  \nThe reason why we don't \"just have a few\" is because having a few is absolutely miserable.\n\nIt is a miserable experience to sit there with blood-curttling cravings, staring into the bottom of the bottle and counting down the seconds until you can take your next sip.\n\nIt's absolutely awful to count your drinks, hide from others, talk to different bartenders so nobody notices, and step outside to get fresh air between sips just to calm the cravings down so you can make it to your next drink.\n\n  \nI don't have 4 beers, because I DON'T WANT to have 4 beers. 4 beers sucks. I wan 4,000. My body craves oblivion.\n\nA few drinks is not enjoyable for me at all.\n\n0 drinks is enjoyable.\n\nEndless drinking until I blackout is enjoyable (temporarily).\n\nNothing in between is enjoyable at all.\n\n  \nThat's not how our brains and bodies or wired. Normal drinkers, sure. They can have a few and enjoy the experience. They drink to have fun.\n\n  \nWe do not drink to have fun. We drink to get obliterated. We drink to satisfy the craving. We drink to beat the bad.\n\nWhy don't you just have a few? Well, why don't you just drink until you blackout and end up in prison? oh, you don't want to? Well, I don't want to just have a few either. So we're even.",

But the SECOND that familiar warmth hits...there is no more fun to be had that night. I want a dozen. I want everyone I'm with to be slamming shots. I want this 2pm burger and beer lunch to turn into a party.\n\nAnd nowadays..I just don't see the point in ordering those two beers. It's more money and more calories I don't need. And I certainly don't need two random beers by myself.\n\nJust because I CAN do it....doesn't mean I should",

It's a little different for everybody, but like you said, the moment we reach it, it's off to the races. \n\nThe only reason I think some people can manage to moderate temporarily is that by very carefully regulating their input, they can prevent flipping that switch. But all it takes is one time maybe drinking a little too fast, or on an empty stomach, or maybe you decide 1 extra is okay because you had a bad day, or whatever, then it's all for naught.",
