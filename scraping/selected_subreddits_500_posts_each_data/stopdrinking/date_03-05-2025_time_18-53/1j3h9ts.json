If you're not dieting and exercising on top of abstaining from alcohol, results will be slower too.\n\nOn top of that, you're probably gaining water weight from not being dehydrated from drinking alcohol.  Water weight is good!  Means your body will be hydrated enough to function properly!",

But if you had been drinking they might have moved up? \n\nIt\u2019s a scientific fact that lower calorie intake than your body requires over time will give results. Cutting out empty calories from alcohol that gives your body zero nutrients is a great choice! No matter what we want to change, consistently taking one day at a time brings impressive results over time. Before you know, you\u2019ll start to notice changes \u2764\ufe0f\n\nYou have this & I am rooting for you \ud83d\ude4c",
