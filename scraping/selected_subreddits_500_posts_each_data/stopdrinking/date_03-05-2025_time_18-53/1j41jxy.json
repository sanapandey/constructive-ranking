    "selftext": "I just spent the last month working in rural Thailand. It was hot, long hours. I took my first hot shower in weeks about an hour ago. Now I'm on the rooftop of my hotel because I'm hungry and this is where the bar/restaurant is. It's beautiful up here. I saw a delicious looking pineapple mojito on their menu just now. I'm by myself, and nobody I know would know if I had a drink here. Nobody here knows I'm a little over three years sober. I haven't had a craving like this in a long time... but I remembered it isn't about the one drink for me. It's about all the drinks that would follow the first. With that thought, I ordered a Pepsi and food instead. I Will Not Drink With You Today, regardless of where I am and who is around me.",

Whenever I go back home to visit family, I find that when I'm at the beach or at a theme park, ordering a mocktail or virgin version of whatever alcoholic beverage I think I want actually scratches the itch quite a bit. I get to enjoy the taste, and still be present to the things around me to enjoy them in full, and not through a haze.",

My mom lives in a beautiful beach community. My dad works in tourism, so I can go to Disney and Universal for free. Beach cocktails while at an outdoor pier restaurant, and fancy theme park drinks (especially in Disney's Epcot, or the Harry Potter park in Universal) are always calling my name. I have to regularly check myself and take it minute by minute sometimes because the cravings just permeate my brain and that little demon is whispering and scratching to get out. As soon as I fly back to the Midwest, I'm fine. It's so strange to me. A margarita while overlooking the ocean is 15x harder to fight than ordering that same drink at a restaurant in South Dakota.\n\nMost of the time, I hold steadfast and don't give in, but I'd be lying if I said I had a 100% success rate.\n\nWhat I do have success with is just, on occasion, ordering those drinks but without alcohol. I know not everyone in recovery is comfortable with this, but in my journey, I have found that it takes away the urge for me, or at least quiets it down to where I can be present in the moment around me. A virgin cocktail/mocktail is pretty much the same as an NA beer for me, which I do see talked about on this sub. I can have the aesthetic and a delicious drink, without poisoning myself and spiraling and falling off the wagon.\n\nI'm so proud of you for not giving in. You're doing great, OP. IWNDWYT!",
