    "selftext": "If you\u2019re thinking of stopping drinking, please consider reading what was the final motivating factor for me stopping. These horrors are real. Whether or not they\u2019ve happened to me/you/someone else yet \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of time for people like us. \n\nI work a M-F 9-5 desk job, but had to work an 8-hour outdoor event in 90\u00b0+ heat. Exhausted from the 6-day workweek and heat, I thought about stopping for a beer or quickly slamming one nearby before driving home. Hell, I deserved it. But for some reason, I didn\u2019t. I got in my car and headed home. \n\nI was driving down a busy street with parked cars lining both sides when I saw a brewery up ahead. For some reason, my eyes didn't drift off the road to fixate on it. I was focused on the road, eyes clear, just ready to go home. As I passed the brewery, a little girl darted into the street from behind a parked car, nowhere near a crosswalk. I saw it happening immediately and it was like slow motion. I slammed my breaks and held my breath. My window was down, and I heard the mom screaming. The little girl was seemingly unaware that I stopped maybe a foot short of her and she finished crossing the street. The mom apologized to me through tears right next to my open window, and yelled at her daughter to stay out of traffic. My fingers hurt from how tightly I gripped the wheel. I finished driving home in silence. And when I got home, I wept. \n\nif I had quickly slammed a beer and been a few seconds early/late, if I had let my eye wander to the brewery, if I had been slightly inebriated - I may have hit her. I could have killed her. Instead, I was clear-headed and that girl will probably/hopefully not even remember it at all. That evening, I was slammed with the very real possibility of alcohol ruining my life, and someone else's.  I never once thought \u201cwhy was she in the middle of the road!?\u201d because that wasn\u2019t the point. Life is full of unexpected moments, and it\u2019s our responsibility to act responsibly and accordingly. I realized I could put down the shovel, that this could be my rock bottom moment. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to stop or for a reason to stop, please know that you don\u2019t need to wait for a nightmare to wake up from the waking coma of alcohol. Every day is a new chance to be a little better than the day before. \n\nIWNDWYT. ",

If OP had had that one beer and been a second late, it still would not of been their fault but the reverberations would have made that a moot point. \n\nNow that mine are teenagers I still find myself constantly watching other peoples kids and anticipating danger.  I have grabbed several out of harms way including tackling one on pavement and ripping one off of a barrier at a zoo because their parents were fucking around on their phone or getting something out of a purse or vehicle or simply distracted.  \n\nAll that being said, I have had the exact same visceral thoughts and experiences as OP.  I am sure most of us have.  It is truly terrifying but also capable of generating serious levels of gratitude.   IWNDWYT",
