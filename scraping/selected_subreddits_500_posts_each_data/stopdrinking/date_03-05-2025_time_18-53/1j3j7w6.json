    "selftext": "Just celebrated my first real and consecutive year of sobriety (for the first time in 10+ years!) in January. I understand that there's this reputation around the first year being the hardest, but I didn't experience this and found it to be (overall) easier.\n\nHowever, it's the last few months that have been difficult. I'm not sure if it's just due to feeling like I have an inability to handle new responsibilities sober, fear of success, lack of coping mechanisms or what...but I have wanted to self-sabotage like crazy lately. I imagine just relapsing and going dark on my relationships and abandoning my responsibilities. Active alcoholism puts me into something of a Fugue state and sometimes I miss not being present in my life during benders.\n\nWorking my program has taught me the importance of playing the tape forward, so I am often able to redirect these thoughts so that they don't come to fruition. But I'm stuck here wondering if these urges to throw my life away will ever leave me. I really hate this shit sometimes.",

Having a daily routine where I pointed at my addiction and said \"I see you, you bastard - you can't sneak up on me if I know you're there\" in the form of a check in at the DCI has really helped.      \nIt's like I've taken back control, I'm in charge of my own thoughts. The smallest inkling of junkie brain trying to self sabotage is met with an automatic \"Shut up and fuck off\".       \nKeep on with your sober routines pal, every sober day is a step in the right direction\ud83d\udc4d",

For me, my thinking at the beginning of my second year was far different than the last part.  Heading into year three, I was amazed that I rarely thought about drinking and *knowing* I was a non-drinker was becoming the new norm.  I remember wondering when the other shoe would drop because, at some point, it just became easy.\n\nSo, a BIG Congrats on 15 months!  I think what you're feeling ('*going on a dark tangent to throw my life away*') is fairly normal.  Addiction is insidious so getting far enough away from that last drink takes time.  On the bright side, the chance of relapse by five years drops to about 7%. The difference is time and developing a *solid* foundation of sobriety.\n\nKeep up the great work, I'm rooting for you!",

In the big picture your drinking was a symptom, so you\u2019ll need to identify the causes and work them out still. You\u2019re right about not having the coping mechanisms! We gave ourselves booze and when that tool is gone we have to learn (or be taught) to pick up another. It feels frustrating (I should know this!) but you\u2019re brain also loves to shame ya, so ignore it and do the next RIGHT thing that FEELS GOOD.",

I checked in with my old therapist last month and that was nice, although we had some differing views about when and where to apply AA lessons and values. Meditation I strictly know is not my lot in life after trying it for 6 years in my early adulthood. Raw-dogging it sucks sometimes but I will continue trying to find what works for me as a healthy means of coping.",
