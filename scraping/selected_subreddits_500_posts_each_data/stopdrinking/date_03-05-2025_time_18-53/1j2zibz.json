    "selftext": "I (29M) am in a sharing mood today. In June I lost my mom. She was my favorite person in this whole world. I had already had a drinking problem but I let myself go off the deep end. I didn\u2019t wanna be saved. Idk what possessed me to check myself into treatment. But today, I am almost two months sober and clean from any drugs. This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without drinking since I was maybe 21. I feel so much better and tbh, idk how I got this far. The cravings have gone almost completely even though not entirely. I just choose not to drink. I\u2019m far enough where I am trying to be conscientious about my sobriety but it\u2019s no longer like I\u2019m on autopilot. I miss my mom so much but I can\u2019t keep letting the addiction win. \n\nTo anyone struggling, there\u2019s no shame in going to treatment. Honestly I wish I would have sooner because believe it or not, those people are there for the same thing. There\u2019s nothing to be worried about. Some of the most understanding and compassionate people I\u2019ve ever met have been addicts.  \n\nOne thing I noticed was that it took about two to three weeks before I even started feeling \u201cnormal\u201d again. The anxiety and restlessness and boredom get so bad, but you have to learn how to live with it and man it can be hard some days. I forgot what it was like to be so bored. It\u2019s not just \u201cquitting drinking\u201d. It\u2019s a genuine mindset shift that I personally needed treatment to help me realize. Just be ready for it to really suck at first. But just know it gets so much better and you look back and go \u201cwhat the heck was I thinking?\u201d \n\nHumans are very resilient but we\u2019re not invincible. I truly wish for everyone that\u2019s struggling with alcohol/substance abuse to have a wonderful life. Keep on fighting. ",

What I didn't do is seek help. She passed 26 years ago. I'm at 54 days, too. \n\nYou are correct in stating that it's a complete change of a mindset. \n\nI'm happy that you are pushing forward and your words of encouragement are touching.\n\nPeace to you. \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f",
