    "selftext": "93 days alcoholfree on a bright sunny day I walked towards the subway station after a dentist's treatment. I had been heavily anxious during five days because of nothing more than a broken filling. Somewhere I read this serious anxiety can keep popping up loooong after quitting alcohol. I used CBD oil to calm my nerves this 5 days. After the dentist's treatment - which was painless thanks to the anaestatic - I walked in an enormous relieve in a cheerful sunny city. Spring! \n\nAt that moment my primal lizzard brain spelled that old song again: 'how wonderful will it be to buy yourself some beers when coming home. Celebrate this day!' \n\nFor some minutes I enjoyed the thought of drinking deserved beers, now all the  stress has gone. Beer as partner of feeling relieved, in this case. \n\nFirst better, frontal, thought after that: 'I can't buy beers, because this morning I did my daily promise not to drink'. The Daily Check in on this sub is the most powerful tool to me! \n\nLater on I managed to frontally think it would be a primal stupidity to reward myself with poison that would cause misery again. Alcohol is not a reward, it's a punishment! Why would I punish myself for feeling fine? \n\nSo I'm enjoying a sunny sober afternoon now. I really start to believe I learned how to treat triggers. But I have to remain careful. \nAnd I have to continue checking in Every Single Day to write down IWNDWYT. \n\nPS\nLast week the ENT doctor told me the MRI scan of the skull base revealed no serious illness, just an abnormal contact between an arteria and a nerve. I posted here appr. one month ago about it. \n\n",

And why would I punish myself with alcohol for feeling anything?  Even anger or shame?  \n\nThank you for this.\n\nIWNDWYToday",
