So I stopped drinking Jan 1 not sure how I was going to make it to July and now I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m never going back. It\u2019s turned into a real journey of healing and self reflection that I didn\u2019t expect. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy for years and have done a lot of work on myself. So, when I stopped drinking, it wasn\u2019t like \u201cwell, shit, now I\u2019ve got this huge mess to face and clean up\u201d but it pulled back the covers on the things I was still numbing out to. It\u2019s been empowering to look at things through a sober lens. It feels like I\u2019m being truthful and accountable for the first time in a long time.\n\nI\u2019m very interested in seeing how this experience continues to evolve - on all fronts - but especially the physical side. I believe my body is still recovering from the years of drinking poison and I\u2019m very interested in how this healing will continue to evolve.\n\nThings that have helped me:\n1. Having a partner who is doing the sober thing too. (Not sure how people do this by themselves - I\u2019m in awe of you and you inspire me.) I\u2019m doing this for me but it helps to have someone going through it with you.\n\n2. Reading This Naked Mind was a huge shift in thinking that I needed at the beginning. I still go back to it and all the sections I highlighted when I need inspiration.\n\n3. NA drinks.\n\n4. Puzzles.\n\n5. Paying attention to my feelings and not judging them. I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time through my work in therapy, but being sober has created such clarity and allowed me to hyper-focus on how I\u2019m feeling and why.\n\n6. This subreddit community.\n\n7. Remembering what alcohol has done to people I know and love.\n\nI wish everyone out there the absolute best on your journey, no matter where it takes you.
