I went sober 6 months ago. \n\nIn that time I have literally gotten everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. I\u2019ve lost 60lbs so far, happier, chattier, work going well, friendships blossoming, learning the guitar. Literally EVERYTHING. But I can\u2019t believe it and it doesn\u2019t feel real and I\u2019m so scared of losing it all. \n\nIs this normal? I just feel like it can\u2019t be that simple for a happier life right?",

            "body": "It's typical enough that there's the colloquial phrase 'the pink cloud' which describes the euphoric experience after quitting alcohol. It can last for weeks or months and it's the feeling that the future looks awesome after beating addiction. The idea being that once the minutiae of life and the factors that drove one to addiction in the first place returns, the cloud dissipates leading to higher risk of relapse.\n\nThat's not to say you're experiencing the pink cloud, but it's good to be aware of it so that you are better equipped to weather the storm should it arrive.\n\nMy advice is to critically think about why you fell into addiction and to work on those things as much as you can everyday in a disciplined manner. For example in my case I struggle with boredom, disorganisation and historically loneliness and used alcohol to self-medicate. In my case I'm sober for a year but I know that if I end up feeling stuck, isolated or bored then all the progress I have made will be thrown into the toilet despite how good I feel right now.\n\nIf you find your trigger points you will fair well long-term. Always be auditing how you're doing rather than relying on the present feel because our emotional state can quickly change and without warning.\n\nKeep up the good work! Keep being mindful of any stressors that present themselves and make sure to address them asap",

Drinkers need to absolutely identify their trigger points and learn to live through those triggering situations without reaching for a drink. One of my trigger points is seeing people standing on their driveways in groups drinking beer. If I drive by a see that it's a difficult couple hours for me not to buy a beer and drain a 12 pack.",

So you FEEL like its 70F in the house. \n\nWell, for some reason as you continue to drink, the temp of the house falls lower and lower. So you drink more and more to stay warm.\n\nOne day you look around and realize the house is at 30F. Below freezing. You HAVE to drink to feel remotely comfortable. \n\nBut one day you run out of booze. And for some reason, on that day, the temp jumps back up to 60F.\n\n60F is absolutely toasty compared to what you've felt the last couple months. Perfect temperature! Absolutely comfortable! How could anyone be upset that their house ever was at 60F?????\n\nBut then.....time goes on...and you start noticing that maybe 60F IS a little chilly. Maybe just for today a little wine to warm up. Rinse and repeat.\n\nSobriety done right absolutely looks better than active addiction. \n\nAnd yes. We can lose everything we gained. I've seen it happen a dozen times, even to myself.",

Maybe you are scared of going back drinking and that's how you lose it all, there is a very simple solution, don't go back there. Sober you is enjoying life and just go with it. You deserve it.

I have a similar experience as in my communication and relationships with those around me and coworkers improved. I found my ability to enjoy interests return, my anxiety and depression lessened. That said, times come where life gets a little rough, and learning to face the adversity is the challenge. It gets easier but it's still hard when it strikes. All That said, seeing the cumulative benefits of stopping alcohol over time continues to motivate to the point I don't want to drink at all.\n\nOccasionally a fall evening or summer breeze causes a sort of nostalgia for drinking times when I was younger, but it ultimately passes and is never too much of a struggle to deal with. I just viee it for what it is, a yearning for a simpler time, not necessarily for a drink in and of itself.",

Big accomplishment! \n\nSince quitting drinking, I feel better and more contented but I have never felt the deliriously happy type of joy you describe. Sobriety didn't solve all my problems by a long shot except insomnia. I still get periods of feeling angry or downcast, still feel unsettled sometimes. But overall I feel calmer and less agitated. I never felt the \"pink cloud\" that some others have experienced. But I take one day at a time and always know it's a slippery slope. I could lapse back into drinking unless I remain eternally vigilent. Complacency is never an option with an alcoholic, at least for me.",
