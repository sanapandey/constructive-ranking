I loveeeee white sangria, especially. \n\n\nNow, I\u2019ve tried some bottled mocktails, but the flavors always seem to be off. I know without the liquor, of course it will taste different, but does anyone have great replacements for the liquor or recipes that provide a similar essence? \n\nAlso, how do we feel about mocktails? Are they triggering? I\u2019m taking 1 month before doing anything alcohol related and a mocktail feels alcohol related. Like when I start to make a Virgin Mary, will I want to drink really badly? \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. ",

I find that adding spice to any mocktail is a pretty good replacement for the alcohol. \n\nI love a mocktail. I don't find them triggering, but i also find that my comfort not drinking in drinking enviornments is more influenced by my glass than what is in it. I feel so much better drinking selzer in a short glass with ice, than drinking a mocktail in a regular juice glass.",

I'd also love to taste their Cosmo flavor but cannot find it. Also, if you liked Negronis there are many NA brands out there that are great!
