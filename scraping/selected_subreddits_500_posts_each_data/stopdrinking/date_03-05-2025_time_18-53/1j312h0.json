    "selftext": "I miss wine tasting events, fancy paired wine meals (alcohol-free wine is just not the same), a glass of really good scotch at the bar.  I really do miss it.  I enjoy the flavor and the conversations and the sophistication of it all.  I REALLY miss the social lubricant aspect of it because I just can\u2019t hold a conversation sober and it really makes work, work-adjacent, and charity events insufferable. \n\nBut I don\u2019t miss what it seems to inevitably lead to.  The wine tasting leads to the meh bottle of wine with dinner at home a couple of times a week.  The great whisky leads to Irish coffees with shit Costco brand 1.75s lasting only a week or two.  It all leads to drinking to excess when traveling in particular, including for work.  I\u2019m slipped pretty badly on my diet and have gained a lot of weight since last December but drinking will just put me back to being straight up fat and will probably kill the fact that I am at least still lifting 2-3x a week.  \n\nSo man do I miss it.  I wish I could trust myself to leave it just to the special things and special occasions.  Maybe it would even work out this time.  But is it really worth the field work to find myself back where I was 15 months ago?  Rationally, it is not. ",
