    "selftext": "After many many years of hard drinking I was definitely physically addicted but as my mind heals, I can see that my drinking was also a habit. Certain things bring it to mind and not in a craving way but in a habitual way. The mocktails are filling some of that void as well as some things that give me that dopamine fix such as walking outside and self care. Anyone else have this awakening and/or things that help you?",

I'm fully conditioned, I am no better than Pavlov's dog. It's been getting easier as the weeks go by, and I slowly but surely break those habits and replace them with healthier things.",
