    "selftext": "I stopped drinking 8 years ago, after I went heli skiing and broke loads of bones and didnt have access to alcohol in the hospital, where I was for 4 weeks.\n\nI told them I was an alcoholic and they tapered me down with clomethiazole (way better than benzos in my opinion, but Ive never heard of American hospitals using that. In Germany its sold under the brand name \"Distraneurin\").\n\nSince then I havent touched a single drink.\n\nRegarding my physical health, I have improved a lot. I regularly do  Krav Maga, swim more than a kilometre multiple times a week, but Ive never found something to take the place of alcohol.\n\nIve done therapy, Ive tried getting into meditation, but nothing worked.\n\nUntil today, Ive never found something that calms me down as much as alcohol did.\n\nI havent really \"chilled\" or felt at ease for 8 years. I dont know what Im doing wrong.\n\nI work a great job, make great money, my marriage is happy, but ever since ive stopped drinking, I havent \"chilled\" at all.\n\n\nHow do you become at peace? How do you truly get to a point where you can just relax and wind down without the help of alcohol/weed/other downers.\n\nDoes anyone sometimes think that life was shittier when they were still drinking, but still fondly look back on situations where alcohol was the ultimate mood enhancer?\n\nSorry for my rambling, its past my bed time, just wondering if anyone else knows what I feel like?\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all your thoughtful comments. Really helped me put everything into perspective.\n\nI have a super busy week ahead of myself, so I probably wont come back to this post 'til friday. But rest assured: I am reading all your comments. Thank you, this is a great community!",

If your mind can realize this lie, you\u2019ll never look fondly at alcohol again.",

This Naked Mind was the first book where I truly resonated with the stated goal (to drink as much as you want, but you won't want to). The Upward Spiral is great too (not alcohol specific, but alcohol certainly ties into depression for us). Naked Mind helped me get to the point where I realized compulsion and not desire were fueling my urges to drink. That realization alone probably cut my consumption to about 30% overnight. The rest took a while and some trial and error, but concepts from the book helped me get there. Happy to see the book has been helping others here\u00a0",

I think you may have nailed it when you said somewhere below that you never \"bottomed out.\"   So maybe you have stuck in your mind that period of time when alcoholic life was just absolutely chill (for me, nearly blissful, in retrospect, without any negative consequence for an astoundingly long time, just nearly pure upside.)  I remember that time.  I was on top of my game man.  Everything clicked, I was at my most witty, insightful, chill, cool, creative, etc.,  but a drunk.  Eventually I reached too high... my hubris got the better of me.  Classic shit.  That's all gone now, gone for good, and it seems to me now, was doomed and unsustainable from the start, cause maybe the universe just doles out that kind of magic on a rare and limited basis.  For the yin, maybe you have to have the yang, man.  Maybe it's like losing the love of your life.  You will never, ever, be the same, but may get a new kind of initially agonizing wisdom about love, anger, grief, attachment, impermanence, emptiness, nothingness, etc.,  Someone said earlier today on the site that quitting drinking put them back in touch with the human condition.  I liked that.  Don't get me wrong, I'd go back in a second, if I could do so consequence free.  But maybe we're not made, or even meant, to be  truly \"chill\" like that.  Consider our brutish evolutionary heritage.  Consider what most all the spiritual traditions throughout history say on the subject.   Maybe suffering is the norm, and if you are doing okay... good enough... maybe that's a very acceptable norm.  Acceptance is a biatch.  You said you still have a lot to be grateful for.   Yours is a very honest post, and I truly appreciate that.  It's making me think as hard as I can.  Perhaps in my blissful radiance years of yesteryear, I'd have a more compelling answer.   My mind will continue to ponder this... in the morning.  PS, I've heli-skied lots in British Columbia.  If you want to the closest thing to transcendent bliss on earth I've discovered, learn to kitesurf, and go ride the waves in Maui!  But I know what you seek is just \"chill\" again.  I hope you find what you need.",

Wise thought, wise action, compassion and loving kindness through meditation.\n\nHaving meetings to go to is helpful for me and people don\u2019t just use it for chemical addictions. One meeting a guy shared that he had been sober a while and was not focusing on his unhealthy eating habits. Another woman said her main addiction was relationships and codependency. Then another guy said he had smoked crack a few weeks ago.\n\nThese are my people apparently because I feel much more connected to the crowd than I did in \u00a0my last couple of years of AA.\n\nThe idea of gaining wisdom is more inspiring to me because I\u2019m not craving alcohol all the time anymore, I just need some guidance and a goal to achieve.",

A third doctor told me I needed to get tested for leukemia (which I did). All of the doctors reviewed my labs. Chatgpt analyzed both issues and recommended I get my magnesium checked. I double-checked my labs and discovered I had a severe magnesium deficiency. All of the doctors plus an ER doctor missed the deficiency on my labs. Also, the doctor that prescribed the gabapentin (which has it's own issues) had earlier refused to give me naltrexone to taper using the TSM. After that and missing my severe magnesium deficiency, I no longer see any of those doctors. \n\nI double-check everything. Especially doctors.",

TONS of work on me, in conjunction with my med regiment- SUDS outpatient treatment for 2 years, AA, anger management, DBT, weekly therapy, SMART Recovery, & loads of other therapeutic stuff. my meds work on the chemical imbalances in my brain, that were present before I started drinking & getting high, & were exacerbated by my substance use.\n\n& because I've done this work, I don't WANT to get loaded- my meds are but one tool I use to STAY sober. \n\nlastly, it's been my personal observation that prescribers LOOOOOVE to throw meds at people seeking help, without ensuring any other kind of work gets done; however, my scope is quite limited....",

I was hopeless and desperate, so full of anxiety and fear. After getting off my knees that day, I was no longer interested in drinking. The obsession left me, and never returned. It all happened so fast, and was so shocking I don\u2019t even have an actual \u201csober date!\u201d I don\u2019t remember my last drink, I just remember all of a sudden, the desire for it was gone. After that, I wanted nothing more than to find out how that happened. I started seeking God. I found him. Jesus literally delivered me from alcoholism. He removed the obsession. Not once in 8 years have I wanted to touch another drink\u2026that is nothing short of a miracle. I have ADHD, so with that, it can still be tough to relax and unwind. CBD has been a Godsend for that. I also run (it\u2019s a natural high), hike, lift weights, eat better. I spend each day of my life living it to the fullest with immense Gratitude, praying and seeking his guidance in my life.

This might involve you taking time to think about what a life would look like to you if you had this all figured out: would you have more unstructured time to yourself if you felt at peace? would you have more, better sleep if you felt relaxed? what would your day look like with the kind of wind down you imagine?

People often speak of them in the same sentence, but being completely sober and falling in love with that feeling is what keeps me going. Had to dig deep to process things in the past, and concurred that many of my past issues were directly connected to my substance abuse. I was living in escape, and now I don't want to escape anymore. Sobriety also means that I try to be a more compassionate, empathetic, honest, and kind person every day. I know if I used substances, I could not become the best version of myself.",

And I'm afraid that that will happen to me. I don't know how old you are but when you're over 40 it's no longer fun, it's just guilt and doing stupid things, having points taken off your driving license or even accidents... \nI've been doing sports for years...but now that I've stopped drinking (I still can't believe how long I've been without drinking) I don't want to go back and have what I read over and over again happen to me. People drink one beer, another day 3 and the next they no longer remember what they did. I'm terrified that I won't be able to get over it.\nI haven't commented in a while, between CrossFit (the next room does krav and bjj, it's trendy) and work I seem to be getting into very healthy protein and creatine groups. I have wasted many mornings and days lately (drinking a third of the typical 20-year-old binges, but now you are left on the couch simply with a headache, guilt, fear...)\nI really hope I don't miss it in 8 years, I gave up tobacco 15 years ago and before everyone smoked, now no one. The day our environment doesn't drink, I believe we will be free. Meanwhile, there is that association with food and drink in any celebration.\nAh, I had to look for the medication but in my country hypnotics are very restricted and they are supplied in hospitals or for severe symptoms to stop alcoholism, but very highly supervised, there is even a national registry and if there is someone who writes out many prescriptions with their ID it is a serious crime.\n\nGood night!",
