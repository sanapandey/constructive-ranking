And it wasn't every time I drank that I did destructive things that led to regret. Sometimes it was nice, with friends, but so that the destructive dragon inside me stays asleep, I can't drink anything.\n\nI'm not sure that if you stop drinking the problem will go away. This will have to be discovered by you. \n\nHowever, for me, not drinking stops the problem.",
