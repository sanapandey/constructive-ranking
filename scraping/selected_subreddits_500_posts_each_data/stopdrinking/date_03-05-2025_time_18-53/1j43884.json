    "selftext": "So I wouldn\u2019t call myself a daily drinker, more of a weekly binge drinker. Think Friday Saturday 5+ drinks. And maybe a couple on Thursday. \n\nI\u2019ve recently realized this isn\u2019t doing me any favors at all. I\u2019m lethargic all week and I\u2019m not super nice on my 4th wine. \n\nSo I\u2019m quitting. \n\nI\u2019m ten days in and questioning if I can do this or not. I\u2019ve ordered $200 in \u201cmock tails\u201d to be delivered for a crutch. \n\nBut what\u2019s most interesting to me so far is I am TIRED. I wouldn\u2019t call it lethargy like before. But I could sleep ten hours a rip!  Once I\u2019m up I feel great but feel like I could sleep forever. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to feel any wild differences since I\u2019m not a daily drinker. \n\nHas anyone else felt this way? Is this normal? If you drank like me- what did your first few months look like? \n\nTIA for sharing. ",

Let your mind and body take the time it needs to heal.  It can' take a few months.  Keep up the great work",
