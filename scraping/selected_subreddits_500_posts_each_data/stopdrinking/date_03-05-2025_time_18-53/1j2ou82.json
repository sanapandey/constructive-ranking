I just decided to quit entirely.\n\nI understand that alcohol is the basis of my job, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a part of my lifestyle. This profession can be a major enabler for people who lack control and I see it in my peers who have no plans of changing. I\u2019m not going to hurt my body or potentially kill myself over a side profession that is meant to give me a little more financial freedom and be a \u201ccreative outlet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a little lonely and I have finally accepted that. I signed up for a gym membership last night and I\u2019m ready to have healthier reasons for \u201crecovery\u201d every evening.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your amazing support. I wasn\u2019t expecting this at all and I don\u2019t feel so alone anymore for doing what I\u2019m doing. Thank you.",

These are great ways to start forming friendships such as water aerobics, Zumba, etc. It\u2019s then nearly always the same faces which leads to new path to healthy friendship\u2019s. \nI think too Meetup groups are great as you can find every interest you can think of and like minded people getting together for hikes, writer workshops, wildlife groups, museum groups. Endless choices. \nI\u2019m at the beginning of this just as you are. I forgot how many interests I had. And I bet if you think about your life before drinking you had hobbies you now have dropped.
