    "selftext": "I am currently on day 6 alcohol free. I read \u201eThis naked mind\u201e last week, absolutely brilliant by the way, and decided to stop right after. Since then my desire is completely gone. I am from a city where we celebrate carnival very intense. There are millions of people celebrating it every year for 6 days straight. Ironically my day 1 was the beginning of that. And you may have guessed it already, alcohol is the main thing. So yesterday I met a friend for a coffee and he asked me if i would like to join them later that day to go and celebrate. I decided before the start of carnival and before I read the book that it would be better for me to not celebrate it at all. But something changed, I was thinking to myself you have to try to go out and party someday, why not today for the ultimate challenge. So I went with them and I can today proudly say that i didn\u2019t drink one drop of alcohol. I got some offers for a beer but I declined every time and I didn\u2019t even once thought that I would have a greater time with alcohol. I went home at around 10pm, went to bed at around 12, slept 8 hours and I am working since then without all the side effects. 6 days ago I never thought that this is possible. So for everyone thinking the same way as me, that you can only have fun with alcohol, just try it. You will see :)",
