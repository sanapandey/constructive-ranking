    "selftext": "I\u2019m about three weeks in & feeling strong. Last weekend, life threw a few curve balls at me: a very serious, unexpected issue with my spouse, followed by a night of no sleep, countless difficult discussions, and then\u2014wam, two days ago\u2014a cold virus. \n\nI cannot tell you how many times I have thanked the universe (and myself!!) that I\u2019m sober for all of this. I was able to have coherent, calm, effective conversations with my spouse. I\u2019ve felt mentally stable enough to respond, rather than react. And although I\u2019m now sick with a cold, my body only has to fight this off\u2014it\u2019s not *also* detoxing ethanol. \n\nHERE\u2019S THE THING. These issues with my spouse? This cold? They all would have happened anyway. We talk a lot about the issues alcohol causes, but these issues were independent of booze, slated for me already. I could have dealt with them drunk/hungover, or sober. And damn if life isn\u2019t easier sober. Conflict management is SO much easier when our brains aren\u2019t drowning in booze. \n\nIt\u2019s wild, despite all that\u2019s going on with my spouse, and my cough and runny nose, I feel joyful. I keep saying, \u201cAt least I\u2019m sober!\u201d This is how our bodies and brains were designed to exist. No wonder it\u2019s easier. \n\nIWNDWYT. ",

Feels good though, huh.\n\nYou\u2019re totally right with this post, just keep pushing past all that BS. I now feel the booze awkwardly staring at me when I walk past it.\n\nIWNDWYT.",
