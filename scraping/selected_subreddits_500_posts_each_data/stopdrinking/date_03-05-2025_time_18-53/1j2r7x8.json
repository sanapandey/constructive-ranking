    "selftext": "I think the typical definition of an addiction is something that negatively disrupts your work or social relationships. I find myself face down in a bottle so often that I tell myself I can't have someone see me in a hungover haze in the days following a bender, so Sundays get pushed off into never and when I do show up the only greeting is \"been a while\", \"long time\", \"where you been\". I have so many excuses for not showing up for this or that event and thought I was pretty successfully invisible, till yesterday.\n\nI've been asked to step aside from leading a ministry because of my absence, and my despondence while I am around. It's something I've known for some time but there nothing like have the words come at you from outside to wake you up. \n\nI don't know if I'll change, my sober streaks are increasingly pathetic. ",

A group like AA may really work for you. There are a lot of other resources available as well. Keep coming back and reading the posts or post yourself, it will really help. Take care and good luck.

Try and take a week off and really speak to God and ask for strength and wisdom. I felt almost cut off completely when I was drinking, but now that I\u2019ve been off it for some time, the connection feels better than ever. For me, the two things were inseparably linked. I couldn\u2019t quit because I couldn\u2019t talk to God, and I couldn\u2019t talk to God because I just wouldn\u2019t give it a good enough shot. You can do it though! You just have to believe you can!",

            "body": "My sober streaks were also getting shorter and shorter to the point where I had mentally given up.\n\nBut a really bad bender and outside confirmation that what I was doing was affecting everyone around me really woke me up.\n\nIt's been about 9 months since that happened. And I'd be lying if I said that the shame of it didn't help me in the beginning.\n\nNow, looking back, it's hard to believe I let it get that far. I have \"cravings\" for a drink most due to social events. But the inertia is now all going in the right direction, and it would be as hard for someone to get me drunk now as it would have been for me to stop drinking then.\n\nBest of luck to you. And congrats on being here and checking in.",
