Friday I had a drink bc I thought I could handle it and it was super nice outside\u2026.been drinking ever since. I almost had a year sober. \n\nMy mom is in the hospital, I just got broken up with, I\u2019m about to get fired. My whole life is falling apart. I tried to request FMLA at work to get to detox, they won\u2019t give it to me. I\u2019m so exhausted, I feel like shit, I have no friends, and I called the suicide hotline last night. \n\nDo not drink, it isn\u2019t worth it. ",

No one can take away your sober days, so try to be proud of that.\n\nI\u2019ve been there, depressed and lonely beyond belief, and drinking copious amounts, trying to drown out the feelings to numbness but finding myself overwhelmed with feeling worthless and calling the suicide hotline not sure if I was actually close to making an impulsive, permanent decision or needing to talk to someone before I got to that point. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone, it might be helpful to go to a meeting and simply share where you\u2019re at and release some of the feelings building up in you. It\u2019s a bit like free therapy, being around people to listen to you.\n\nIn any case, thank you for sharing. IWNDWYT",
