Like a week, a month 90 days etc and have a planned mini celebration for those dates to look forward to?\n\nI think it would help my motivation. I\u2019m currently 2 days sober and would like to find a way to keep moving forward.\n\nThoughts?",

As long as you don't reward yourself with alcohol, more positivity is a great thing.  \nSome people will even set rewards, like buying themselves a thing they always wanted from the money they would have otherwise spent drinking. Whatever keeps you motivated is allowed. There is really only the one rule: IWNDWYT  \nGood luck!\n\nEdit: typos",
