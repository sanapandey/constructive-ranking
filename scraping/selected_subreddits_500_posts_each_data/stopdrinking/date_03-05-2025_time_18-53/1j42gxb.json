    "selftext": "I would never say I was an \u2018alcoholic\u2019. I know it\u2019s a very loose term to throw around but I never woke up needing a drink and I could function perfectly fine without one. However I definitely binge drank a lot every week for the wrong reasons or felt I needed to have 2 or 3 before social events just to feel relaxed. \n\nI haven\u2019t had a drink for two and a half weeks now. I didn\u2019t even tell myself I was going to try and stop, for some reason I just haven\u2019t wanted one. Being the designated driver a couple times has helped when going out for a meal, and after the first 3 days or so of not drinking I haven\u2019t really thought about having one. However I feel like I\u2019ve picked up bad habits while combatting my drinking - I\u2019ve found I\u2019m having a Monster energy drink every day at work (the zero sugar one but still not great), or I\u2019m demolishing a pack of biscuits or chocolate with a cup of tea (not every day may I add). I mean I\u2019m assuming these are healthier than drinking alcohol but I don\u2019t want these to become an \u2018addiction\u2019 as well.\n\nAnyone else had similar experiences?  \n\n",

Without alcohol my body is trying to mimic the same effect using sugar instead of alcohol. I\u2019m hoping over time to be able to balance that out",

My drinking was just a symptom of a deeper malady, and there are still many compulsive ways I may try to ignore it or hide from it.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m always going to obsess about something, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m never going to *not* have a bad habit somewhere in my life\u2026 I\u2019m only human. I just do my best to guide my obsessions into places that do little to zero harm to myself or others. I can\u2019t afford to chastise myself for not being a saint. I don\u2019t have to drink anymore, and that\u2019s enough of a load off my life to give myself a little Grace sometimes.\u00a0",
