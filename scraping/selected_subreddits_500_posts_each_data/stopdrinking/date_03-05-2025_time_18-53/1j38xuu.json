    "selftext": "I love everything about it! It's hard to describe everything great that has come from putting down the bottle. I love being able to keep my word! Get things done! Even the tedious tasks don't bother me anymore. I can look at a big challenge and think, \"I got this.\" Anything can be done with taking one step at a time. And it's not a race either! I am only competing with myself. Actually, I think I do better, I think we all do better, when more of us are doing well. It helps us learn to see how others can do it in their own ways! So, don't be too shy! Share your stories, it can help others!",
