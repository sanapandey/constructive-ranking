It was awesome remembering every moment and waking up refreshed (slightly sore from head banging but that\u2019s beside the point).",

But what\u2019s even more powerful is the *reality* you\u2019re choosing\u2014waking up clear-headed, fully remembering every moment, and being *present* for your friend\u2019s big day.\n\nWeddings can be tricky because they\u2019re so wrapped up in tradition and expectation, but honestly the best moments aren\u2019t in the drinks\u2014they\u2019re in the conversations, the laughter, and actually feeling *good* in the moment rather than chasing a buzz.\n\nYou\u2019ve already made your decision, now just follow through. Have a plan (grab an AF drink, step outside if you need a breather), and remind yourself that Sunday morning *you* is going to be so damn proud. You got this!",
