I\u2019m on day 3/4 and feeling like I have a really short fuse??  \n\nMy skin, eyes, & puffiness is getting better but my fuse is really short and I\u2019m sleeping more than I\u2019d like to. \n\nIs this normal? \n\nNow I feel like a bitch when I snap at my mom and I can\u2019t even blame it on alcohol actually I was nicer when I was drinking a bottle of wine every night\u2026 like is this permanent? Please reply. What\u2019s the point if I\u2019m a monster to everyone around me and I was nicer when I was drinking\u2026.",

Yeah, when I'm drinking I'm way more companionable, but in order to get to the point where I'm drinking I have to be hungover, miserable, and white-knuckling it all day to get to that first drink. And while I might be happy and patient and funny, at some point I'll black out and won't remember a lot of it. Same thing next day. I'm praying and trusting that at some point the patience and happiness will come back, but I have to get all this stuff out of my system and get a new routine before that happens. Good luck, OP.

It\u2019s like I can tune it out or numb myself to the chaos when I know I\u2019ll indulge in blacking out later. Your reply actually really helps, thank you. I definitely think this is temporary until our bodies recalibrate. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who is experiencing this. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

If you can, explain to your mom what you are going through and it's not personal. If you keep drinking you will become that monster pretty much all the time. It really does get better with each passing day. Stay patient with your self, you can do this. IWNDWYT",

            "body": "Mood swings are extremely common for the first week or two. Your whole system is detoxing and trying to regulate itself back to a *real* normal, not the normal it was used to. It's basically like quitting cigarettes - alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, they're all classified as drugs because they alter our brains. It's just part of the withdrawal process, but it will end. I promise you, it will get better, and it is so worth it.\n\nAlcohol doesn't make the problems or underlying emotions go away, it only numbs and blinds us to them and they come rip-roaring out later, worse, because they weren't dealt with properly in the first place.\n\nI'm proud of you for taking the first step. You've got this - just stay vigilant, breathe, and take it one minute at a time if you have to. The only thing that matters is progress, not perfection.\n\nIWNDWYT \ud83e\udd0d\n\n\n* Edited to add an extra point",
