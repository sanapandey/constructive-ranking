    "selftext": "hi i havent posted here before but ive been a pretty heavy drinker for about 3 years now since I got out of high school and its gotten to the point where ive essentially lost all motivation to do anything but drink. i decided i was tired of living in this cycle around last week, so i looked on this subreddit for something to read (i planned to stay in bed for a couple days to dry myself out) and i got a copy of This Naked Mind. \n\ni have about 2 or 3 chapters to go and i havent wanted to drink the past few days so i havent. i dumped out what i had about an hour ago before I made this post. i feel like im waking up and finally taking control instead of just succumbing to the darkness.. i had a good day today. \n\ni dont wanna tell my friends and family i quit drinking yet because its only been a couple days and idk maybe it doesnt seem like a lot to some people but honestly im so proud of myself, this is the longest ive gone in a while and im actually able to control my urges. im just happy and wanted to share that with you guys since yall helped me\n\n",
