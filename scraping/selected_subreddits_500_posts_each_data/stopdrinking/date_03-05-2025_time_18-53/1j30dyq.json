But I'm still fighting the good fight. I hope you all are too. Let's see where our potential can actually bring us when we finally start to fight for it.\n\n\nIWNDWYT",

Buddhism, for me.   \n\nFor those desperate enough, there is some \"magic\" empathy at AA when your are first trying to plug the jug, even though I don't go any more, except in case of emergency risk of relapse. \n\nYou don't EVER have to utter a single word, but it still can help big time. When they ask \"are there are any newcomers who want to...,\" you don't have to say anything at all. Just sit there if you want... and walk out of the meeting whenever you want, and don't talk to anyone after the meeting if you want. Just get up and leave, and come back if YOU want to. LOTS of newcomers do that. However, if you leave in the middle of the meeting as a brand new newcomer, someone MAY follow you out simply to ask if you are okay. Handle THAT how you want to. Say you're okay, or break into tears, whatever. There are NO requirements for AA EXCEPT \"a desire to stop drinking.\" Period, full stop. But there's magic empathy there. They will feel it for you, even if you never open your mouth to speak ever. You will feel it for them when you hear some stories. Magic, I swear, but only as much as you want, on your terms. The magic can lift you up.\n\nLove.",
