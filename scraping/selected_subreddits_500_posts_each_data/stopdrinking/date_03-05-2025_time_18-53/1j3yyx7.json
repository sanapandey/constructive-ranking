I know I will be a good Mom too. But alcohol feels like the devil and angel on my shoulder these days. \n\nI won\u2019t have kids until I\u2019m ready. I know it\u2019s not fair. But I\u2019m so terrified of either ending my life or destroying my life, or just destroying my health before I get there.\n\nEach day I feel closer to death than to life. I don\u2019t know how to better describe things than that. \n\nIt\u2019s not what I want for myself and I feel like I was destined to be an amazing mom. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. ",

I don't/ didn't know if I want kids, but I knew if I was going to have them, I wouldn't with my daily drinking and chaotic life. If I didn't choose kids, I still wouldn't accomplish anything career or otherwise if I didn't fix my life. So, either continue on the path or fix my life for whichever future I end up having.\n\n\nSo, I chose life. Insert trainspotting gif here",
