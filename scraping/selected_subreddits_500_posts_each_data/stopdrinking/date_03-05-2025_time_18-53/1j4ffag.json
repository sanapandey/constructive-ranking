    "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know where to start, but I wanted to share my problem with someone to see how I can solve it.\nI started drinking when I was 14 years old. I don\u2019t really know why I did it\u2014maybe it was to be the \"cool guy\" in my group of friends. Anyway, everything was fine until I was 15 and my grandfather passed away. That\u2019s when my drinking got much worse. I started getting drunk much more frequently until I turned 16. That\u2019s when I truly realized I had a serious problem.\n\nNone of my friends knew I was getting drunk so often because I usually did it alone. I even stopped going out with them just so I could drink. Then, one day, I almost died because of alcohol. I was drunk on a Saturday night (as usual) and walking alone down the street when I lost my balance and fell backward, hitting my head on the pavement. I lost consciousness and lay there bleeding until a passerby found me.\n\nAnyway, most of my friends don\u2019t even talk to me anymore because they feel embarrassed to go out with me. Now, I only have one or two close friends left. I don\u2019t know what to do or who to ask for help, but I need a change urgently.\n\nI hope this short story can serve as motivation for someone.",

The good thing is that you have realized that alcohol is a problem at a young age. That means that when you get sober you have your whole life to enjoy it.",

No amount of alcohol can heal the pain, the struggles with jobs and relationships you will endure, and the pain you will inflict on others.\n\nI know quite well that one cannot simply will sobriety into your life. But this is existential and you are young enough to push your life path into something better. This is existential.\n\nIf you have money and means, seek help. If you don\u2019t, save your money and make friends with sober people.",

Make yourself accountable.\n\nAlso, give yourself credit every day or hour that you win. Stopping drinking feels boring at first. But it eventually opens up so much energy to do things, meet people, live and love.",
