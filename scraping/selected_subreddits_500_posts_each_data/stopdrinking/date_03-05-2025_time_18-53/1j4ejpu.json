    "selftext": "Just wondering how long after you stopped drinking did you hold yourself accountable for other bad habits ? \nI started smoking again and it's been atleast once to four times a day. \nWhile it might not seem like much I feel really sick and gross after I do it but now it's become a bad habit. I would like to kick it , I've been pretty hard on my self about smoking again because it's so gross for various reasons and it doesn't make me feel healthy. I'm 17 days In to sobriety. I don't want to put to much pressure on myself yet but I do want to quit. \n\nWhen did you stop your other bad habits like smoking , junk food , etc...",

As I\u2019ve got more grounded in recovery (not just abstaining) I\u2019ve started tackling other things - eating more healthily, losing weight, getting a lot more exercise, reducing sugar etc \n\nI still vape and I\u2019m not ready to kick that yet, but it is something I will look to give up towards the end of the year. \n\nI hope this helps in some way.",

I went pretty crazy lol So, I\u2019ve started back on my healthy(for the most part) food intake & Intermittent Fasting(Mankind\u2019s secret blessing). \n\nGive yourself some time to be \u201cbad\u201d because you are doing yourself a huge favor by quitting drinking. Adding years onto your life! Eventually, do the same with smoking. Cigarettes is what you\u2019re smoking, I\u2019m assuming. Yeah, that shit is really bad for you so, eventually cut it out.\n\nYou\u2019re mentally strong and capable of quitting alcohol which is A BIG DEAL. You\u2019re capable of doing anything.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728",
