I was super nice and didn\u2019t do anything SUPER SUPER dumb but I just hate the anxiety of remembering this stuff. I texted old friends and was overly eager to hang out and be \u201cbffs\u201d again. Does anyone have any advice for when the fall of the horse and are struggling with anxiety about it?? ",
