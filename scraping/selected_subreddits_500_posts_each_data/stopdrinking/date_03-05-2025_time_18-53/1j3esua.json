    "selftext": "A dozen wake up calls and several relapses later, I quit drinking on the 28th of August. I was going to get one last bottle of wine that day but fought the urge and decided I've already had 1000 \"last drinks\" and one of those would suffice.\n\n  \nI hit six months over the weekend. Surrounded by friends doing the stuff I'd normally be getting shitfaced doing, except sober now. Having more ACTUAL fun instead of tricking my brain into thinking it's having fun, and waking up feeling refreshed the next morning instead of wasting half of my weekend recovering in bed.\n\n  \nThere was something different this time, maybe it was how far I fell beforehand I'm not exactly sure. But now it isn't \"I'm not drinking right now\" or \"I'm taking a break\". It's a firm \"I don't drink\". Those cravings still hit and they're sneaky little bitches, but I feel like I understand the lie now. I can't moderate and that's okay. I can feel a little sorry for myself that these are my genetics and then move on and focus on dealing with the hand I'm dealt and enjoying the real shit.\n\n  \nI get to wake up and do my little morning ritual again. Coffee and Crosswords to ease into the day. I hadnt done that in months and I get to have it back, how great is that? Sure as hell beats rolling around in my bed waiting for the nausea to subside. NA Beer and Kombucha have been a great replacement for the wine I'd typically reach for when cooking/cleaning. My amazing partner doesn't have to see me in a drunken stupor anymore.\n\n  \nHuge thank you to everyone here. I mostly just lurk but doing so when those damn cravings hit has been tremendously helpful. We can all do this! Your successes and slip-ups have inspired me and I hope mine inspire you. I'll share the wisdom I read here that helped me the most when I first started my sober journey:\n\n  \n**\"Play the tape forward. I've never woken up in the morning and wished I drank last night.\"**\n\n  \nIWNDWYT!",
