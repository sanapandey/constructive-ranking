    "selftext": "I had 23 days thanks to a vacation that really let me unplug. A week after getting home I relapsed, last Saturday. Then of course again last night and I feel like I\u2019m back on that fucking addiction train. I got super stressed due to work yesterday and then picked up a 6 pack otw home and then a bottle of whiskey and off I went. Fuck I feel so much self loathing right now. :((",

            "body": "Hey, I just want to start by saying\u2014you are not an idiot, and you are not back at square one**.** I know it *feels* like that right now, but the fact that you had 23 days shows that you *can* do this. Those days weren\u2019t erased, and neither is everything you learned from them.\n\nStress is such a massive trigger, and your brain just went back to the old, familiar way of coping. That doesn\u2019t mean you failed\u2014it just means you\u2019re still figuring out new ways to deal with those moments. And that takes time.\n\nThe self-loathing you\u2019re feeling right now? That\u2019s the real trap. It\u2019ll try to convince you that you\u2019re stuck, that you can\u2019t do this, that you *might as well* drink again. But that\u2019s just a lie addiction tells to keep itself alive. You don\u2019t have to believe it.\n\nSo instead of spiraling in shame, try shifting into curiosity. What *really* happened here? What was the thought right before you stopped for that 6-pack? What would have helped in that moment? The more you understand, the more power you take back.\n\nAnd most importantly\u2014just start again. Don\u2019t overthink it, don\u2019t dwell in the guilt, just focus on today. You already know that alcohol doesn\u2019t actually help. So take a deep breath, re-center, and get back to what *you* want for your life.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and you\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re learning. And you can do this.",
