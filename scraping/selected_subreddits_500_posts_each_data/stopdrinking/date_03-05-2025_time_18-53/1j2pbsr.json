But because I'm so depressed, no matter how many times I realise alcohol doesn't help it's still there. I'm missing out on so much because of it. I'm miserable and I hate it. But I know it could be better without these sessions of drinking alone. Hope I can stick to it this time \ud83d\ude14 ",

            "body": "Alcohol releases high levels of dopamine. Not only it feels good, makes me not worry about things, lets me \"enjoy\" my life, but it also tells the brain that it was a correct course of action. Basically it motivates neurological pathways to get established that reinforce the choice to drink, even after I've decided not to. It's like a chemical \"good idea\" that functions as a method and a reward. So when I feel depressed, stressed, lonely, my brain instantly goes for the established and reinforced route. And then when I try to commit to not drinking, my brain goes into overdrive to justify going back to drinking, by making me extra stressed, annoyed, desperate. Understanding this helped me realize that just because my brain is thinking about a drink, doesn't mean I have to react to it. It's like letting a child have a cake, but then taking it away. The child goes into all kinds of tantrums, simply because it doesn't understand why it can't \"just have it.\" \n\nIn times when I know my brain will go into overdrive thinking about getting drunk or high, I just need to pretend that I am the parent of that spoiled little brat child. If I just keep yelling at it \"No. You can't have cake! No. You can't have cake!\" It doesn't teach the child, and instead it just builds resentment, gets more agitated, annoyed. So when I notice the brain tantrums, I just pause, and see what I can do that is not instantly running to the bottle. Or even better, expect the tantrums and find ways to avoid situations where it will start to obsess over the idea of cake. \n\nIWNDWYT",

What worked for me was to target the source of my cravings \u2014 I still held the belief that alcohol was bringing me some form of pleasure or joy or relief from my depression. (Spoiler alert: it actually makes our depression worse and steals from us the things that we once naturally enjoyed.) \n\nIf we still desire alcohol, of course quitting is difficult because we feel like we are depriving ourselves of something good.\n\nAllen Carr\u2019s book Stop Drinking Without Willpower helped me undo years of brainwashing from society of believing that alcohol benefitted me in some way. Once I broke that mentality, quitting was SO much easier.\n\nI hope you consider checking it out, it has helped so many people quit who weren\u2019t able to before. I ordered the book online.\n\nBest wishes, IWNDWYT",

I used alcohol to numb the depression for a long time but have only recently been trying to get more sober and the affect it has on my mental health is pretty wild. My mood is so much more stable, eventually joy returns in the small things of everyday life, and the depression isn\u2019t nearly as heavy. I hope you are able to find out the same for yourself you deserve it \ud83d\udc9b\u2728 remember you\u2019re not alone",
