I even went to bottle shops twice today but have ridden the wave and haven\u2019t drunk but feel like my brain has been focused on not drinking 100% of the day. So  trying to focus on a good thing today. Today my dog and I had the best play time she was genuinely content. Thought people might share one too to make us all smile. ",
