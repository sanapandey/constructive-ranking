    "selftext": "I\u2019m (F48) and have been drinking on and off for 5 years. I grew up in a high demand religion) and for 4/5 years I drank I\u2019d say moderately. Since October, my husband has done me dirty\u2026..tells many different women that we are separated to get dates (he\u2019s a global traveler). I didn\u2019t know we were in a one sided open relationship and when I found out I hit the bottle daily. \nI\u2019m in therapy and it\u2019s helped my mental state well\u2026.and also I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve developed a habit. \nNow, it\u2019s daily 40% @ 3 full shots (sometimes more) and once a week I stop for 36 hours. I am ashamed. I am sad. I get shakey and take a shot to hide the shake. \nI\u2019m see that I\u2019m falling down the rabbit hole of a struggle I thought I wouldn\u2019t face and would like to share this \u201cout loud\u201d and seek input big and mall, kind and pull myself up from\nMy bootstraps (or bra straps) with any encouragement and wisdom!",
