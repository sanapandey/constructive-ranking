    "selftext": "I am on day 11 right now and it\u2019s the longest I\u2019ve gone in years. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m doing it, physically I feel amazing, but doing this wasn\u2019t entirely by my choice. My partner and I had a big blow up and he told me he needed a break from living together due to my drinking, and I have to stop for at least 30 days before he will trust me to move back in. I\u2019ve been living with my parents who are both sober so I haven\u2019t had any influences/temptations, but today I am really struggling for some reason.\nMy parents hate marijuana which I typically use daily, and not being able to use it while living with them has made not drinking feel 10x harder. I want so badly to just pick up a few beers on my way home from work, I could easily hide it from my parents and lie to my partner, but the guilt of lying would feel devastating to me so I know I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m so grateful my partner is even giving me a second chance and I couldn\u2019t bear not keeping this promise to him. I feel like I\u2019m damned if I do and damned if I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t even know how to cope right now I\u2019m so bored I\u2019m so lonely I\u2019m sad and I miss my partner and I don\u2019t want this to be my life. Please help me. What are your coping strategies when you feel like you have nothing?",

Also I felt bad for days after. Also you don't have nothing. You have a life and an opportunity to make the best of yourself. Drinking wont help you with that. It cant cause its just a chemical. The work on yourself has to come from you.",

Groups like AA, Smart Recovery, etc and are listed in the About section of this sub ( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/about/ ). \n\nAlso, many people here recommend useful books including Allen Carr\u2019s \u201cQuit Drinking Without Willpower\u201d and Annie Grace\u2019s \u201cThis Naked Mind\u201d.\n\nI have recently finished Allen Carr\u2019s book and found that for me it is helping a great deal.\n\nTwo quotes from the book I find particularly powerful are:\n\n\u201cYou hit rock bottom when you decide to stop shoveling\u201d.\n\n\u2060\u201c The craving is not relieved by the drug you\u2019re addicted to, it is caused by it\u201d \u2022\n\nYou might want to give one or both a read.\n\nIWNDWYT",

Ever listen to the Andrew huberman podcast episode about alcohol and the effects it has on you? It\u2019s one of the few things I can listen too and it snaps me right out of a craving. I can\u2019t remember the episode number but if you google it it\u2019s easy to find on YouTube etc.",
