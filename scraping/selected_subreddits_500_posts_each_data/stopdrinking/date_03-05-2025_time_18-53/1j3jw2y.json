    "selftext": "For context, I drink most days but I\u2019m able to take breaks when I choose to, so I\u2019m unsure if that would classify me as a full-blown alcoholic. That said, I do tend to drink excessively when I do indulge. I want to quit drinking, but I\u2019d still like to have the occasional drink - for example at my brother\u2019s wedding next month. I drank at his engagement party and it made the experience much more enjoyable.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is it possible to drink only on special occasions or is quitting an all or nothing decision?",

I will say that if you (or anyone for that matter) is an alcoholic, moderation is not possible and you can never pick up a drink again. Doing so will throw you back into a cycle of compulsive behavior. For me, it was never enjoyable just having one or two drinks..it was always more. As I heard it once said, if you think it\u2019s hard saying no to the first drink..try saying no to the second or third..",

I am an alcoholic, so moderation will never work for me..it\u2019s all or nothing. One is too many, and a thousand isn\u2019t enough. All I can and want to say is that when I finally did accept that I was an alcoholic and that I could never drink again my life drastically changed for the better and continues to do so every day in sobriety.

If you want to mostly abstain but have a binge with friends a few times per year, there's no law preventing you from doing so.\n\nPersonally, I did a year and a half of moderate drinking with the very rare light binge (I think max was 6 drinks over 8 hours).\n\nAt the end of 2024, I realized it simply wasn't worth it for me any more. I love how I feel when I'm not drinking, and the (very) brief glow I got on days I drank didn't outweigh the negative side effects. For ME.\n\nI clearly wasn't ready to make this change at younger ages, but now that I'm in my 50s I want to optimize my remaining decades to prioritize good health. \n\nGood luck to you!",

The large majority of people who drink alcohol, are moderate or light drinkers. The question is just...are YOU one of those people?\n\nPersonally, when i try to moderate i can go for good stretches of not drinking, but then when i do drink, i go overboard. So my moderation ends up looking like binge drinking. And then if you aren't drinking regularly, you have no tolerance, so when you do drink it really hurts. If every time you try to moderate, it turns into that, then no, you probably can't.",

I was there for a month in an environment where I used to drink heavily. But I didn\u2019t this time. While there I kept my drinking to the weekends and would have three beers max. I had learned and could moderate.  \n\nI think the abstinence only approach is helpful at first because a key to drinking is breaking the physical addiction and the psychological/behavioral aspect of it. It seems helpful to have that be a focus as a person relearns how to live without alcohol. \n\nBut I agree. Moderation is certainly attainable and people who have learned how to do that aren\u2019t posting on here or comment that much.",

But I know I slipped way into the well instead of just looking down into it. The repercussions on my even occasional drinking on my mental health, physical health, checkbook memory, just aren't assuaged by my idea of a good time doing it. For me, too, eventually the time between binges grows shorter, and turns into a multi-day bender ignoring my problems. I don't want to wonder if I'm hurting people around me, and I don't want to keep inviting long-term health consequences.\n\nControlled drinking just doesn't interest me, and the cons far outweigh the perceived pros any more. You might be able to do it - I just know that it isn't for me anymore. Alcohol makes me feel BAD.\n\nWhat was much more enjoyable about your brother's engagement party with drinking? You could always try out abstaining from alcohol at events you'd typically drink? Maybe they're just fine. Think about what you value in your experience, and think about how you'd be feeling if you had indulged.\n\nOnly you can decide if your drinking is hurting you or holding you back.
