    "selftext": "But I feel that quitting drinking is not a sacrifice, it's the opposite. Drinking was the thing that made me sacrifice a lot. A lot of my time, a lot of my abilities, and a lot of opportunities. Alcohol use to take so much energy and give nothing in return. Alcohol always had me thinking about how I could get wasted drunk without causing concern from others. Selfish thinking, selfish behavior, am I right? \nQuitting drinking let me have my agency back! I now choose where to go, what to do, when I want. No more alcohol controlling my mind! I \"sacrificed\" the bottle, and I have been progressing in life ever since! But don't get it twisted, it's not a linear progression. It's an up and down and sideways looping rollercoaster of progression, and sometimes the ride stalls, but we don't lose hope! Things will always get better with the continued sacrifice of alcohol!",

Im no longer chained to a bottle or too drunk, hungover or too weird to go out and do stuff. It taken some work to rewire my brain. Asking myself what I like to do for fun and how I like to relax were deep / scary questions at first but that\u2019s gotten easier to answer with practice.\n\nI caught a glimpse of what sobriety looked like on a few sober friends when I was still drinking. We didn\u2019t have to talk about it but it put a bug in my ear. I think about that now and it helps me decide what i want my sobriety to look like",
