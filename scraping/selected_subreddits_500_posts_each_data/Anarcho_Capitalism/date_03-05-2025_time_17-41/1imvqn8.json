    "selftext": "Being a free speech absolutist is a farse! Having someone walk up to my child and describing lude material would boil my blood. I now want responsibile restrictions on activity and speech of free people. I recognize that it comes down to me as a parent as to what my child is introduced to. But if some free speech absolutist shouts in their face something irredeemable or a worse action, if there isn\u2019t a law or moral framework opposing said action. What is the recourse or a reasonable response? Would it not benefit society to embed and construct a moral framework based on morals and values we wish to perpetuate? Those can change, but on some level there is a moral or societally acceptable boundary of societal interaction. The larger a society gets the need for a declaration of solidarity persists.",

And it's rather easy to protect yourself and your kid from that if you do not want to be exposed to what others publish. (The fire/theater analogy which always comes up is nothing but a framed argument and distraction).\n\nThe final point is, just because you do not want to read or see something, does not grant you the right to censor on everybody else's behalf. Nor does it grant any government such powers, in an attempt to \"protect\" you. It's not a business the state should be into in the first place.",

You don't get to demand that those things be removed from the world at large -- which *doesn't belong to you* -- just so you can shirk that responsibility.\n\n> What is the recourse or a reasonable response?\n\nThe reasonable response is to accept that if you are exposing your children to a social environment in which people are saying \"irredeemable\" things, that was your decision and is entirely your responsibility.  If you want to shelter your kids, it's your job to build the shelter, not mine or anyone else's.\n\n> Those can change, but on some level there is a moral or societally acceptable boundary of societal interaction.\n\n\"Society\" isn't a monolithic blob that exists separately from you.  The society you live in consists of the particular relationships and social contexts you choose to participate in.   If you don't want to interact with people or participate in communities that aren't consistent with your own values, you don't have to.  How you interact with \"society\" is your choice, and if you're not being choosy enough, again, 100% on you.",
