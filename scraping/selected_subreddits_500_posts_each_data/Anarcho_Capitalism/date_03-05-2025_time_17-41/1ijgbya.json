If Elon starts doing that I guess we're back to the status quo. Elon isn't the one who made an absolute mockery of our Constitution and the time to talk about checks and balances was in the 1930's when FDR started seizing gold from citizens to fund his welfare programs.\n\n\nI don't care about Elon having that information any more than I care about the FBI or the NSA having it. Infact I'm more content with Elon having it because it's not his sole explicit goal to spy on me. I'm also skeptical of how much information he really has, but if you're gonna audit, then audit.\n\n\nIn short, yeah he could go nuts. But the government IS nuts. If you limits it's scope at all, it's a win.",

I think he views this as an annoying diversion but necessary to preserve the US in order to continue his actual goals. Also, he's again too rich to corrupt. Regardless of whether their motivations are pure or self serving, their goals at least for the moment align with ours.

The man with the most capital and influence is definitely shown to be the most powerful. Trump doesn\u2019t have 250 million cash on hand. We know most of his worth comes from over evaluated properties. Musk bought him out and now has free rein. \n\nElon is literally centralizing power under himself. Hell jimmy carter sold his peanut farm so that he would have conflict of interest. Now we have a foreign billionaire who receives tens of billions in government funding now accessing the most integral parts under the guise of \u201ccutting waste\u201dwhile he himself is the beneficiary of said waste yet won\u2019t stop his own gravy train.
