Trump is proposing tax cuts that would result in lower taxes for everyone, especially via no income tax on tips, overtime, and social security benefits. \n\nWhere ITEP is making a leap is by saying that trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would create price increases that would offset the income tax reductions. The problem there is that Trump is throwing out a lot of different tariff numbers as a negotiating tactic. I don\u2019t expect that we will have 60% tariffs on China, which is what they are assuming. It\u2019s really premature to make assumptions about that.",
