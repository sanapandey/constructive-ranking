The Al-Qaida were the precursor to the Taliban, which was so destroyed by the military that the Taliban were able to take over, only for the US to fuck them up so hard that ISIS became a regional power in the area, only to be fucked up so hard the Taliban took charge once again. This is all in a part of the world where even during times like the Ottoman Empire there was still not piece. It is quite literally a bleeding land. Mexico is not. The Cartels are a business that have to have money to operate. All we need to do is make the cost of doing business too high for people to want to do it. You should remember that Cartels are armed to fight police in the US, civilians, and other Cartels,  they aren't really good at fighting the police, and have had their asses kicked by civilians with civilian firearms.\n\nAlthough Osama Bon Laden, that guy is of course another story. I'm sure he will continue to be an ongoing problem for years to come.",

If we started bombing Mexico and doing what you described in your other comment, coke, fent, heroin, meth, etc., would just flow through different, more profitable channels. What you're describing would make the price of drugs high enough to justify the increased scrutiny of shipping containers flowing directly from other places.\n\nWhat you described would make drugs more profitable and redistribute power to different cartels in different areas. It would make the US drug market more desirable and make the total revenue from drugs increase substantially.\n\nIsn't this basic supply and demand? It's impossible to make the cost of doing business too high for people to want to smuggle drugs. The riskier it becomes to smuggle drugs into the US, the more expensive drugs would become because demand isn't changing. It would be more effective to establish some kind of authoritarian regime that polices the local population to curb stomp demand and local distributors like Singapore/Indonesia than it is to start bombing different countries.",
