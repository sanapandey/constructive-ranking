When they were established, many people lost their land. That isn't exactly the citizenry's fault, but that was the first impression that the nation made. The leaders gladly accepted stolen land after the war. Since then, they have made little effort to engage in peace. Rather, they invite aggression from other nations and then retaliate to gain more territory and influence in the region. (Cry bullying)",

But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.  \n  \nIt is obvious that Jesus is arguing for a non-violent form of resistance. \"Kill 'em with kindness,\" if you will.  \n  \nBut it isn't a good understanding to say Jesus is advocating \"rolling over\" when people bully you.  \n  \nUsing the mile example. Roman law said that a soldier on a road had the right to demand free labor from anyone, and force a civilian to carry his bags for up to a mile. So by \"volunteering\" to walk 2 miles, what are you doing? You are making it appear as though the soldier is breaking the law. The soldier is only allowed to force you to go 1 mile, and if he says, \"but the guy *volunteered* to go two miles!\" - no one will believe him. So you are going to get that guy in trouble. And the Romans were not *kind* when disciplining their soldiers.  \n  \nAnd the cheek example: note that it said slapped on your \"right\" cheek. Then offer the other. In other words:  \n\"Ohh. You just hit me with your left hand. That's your weak hand. *Give me a real hit.*\"  \n  \nIn other words, if you understand the context of the society they lived in, most of these things Jesus is calling for is begging for the other person to break the law. This is a call for a stiff spine and just defiance. It is saying not to retaliate, yes, but it is doing so in a way that is even more damaging to your \"enemy\" than hitting back would be.  \n  \nSo yeah. I advocate turning the cheek.",

                            "body": "You are arguing a semantic about resisting *evil,* when you should be arguing a semantic about *resisting* evil. What does *resist* mean in this context? The context is \"an eye for an eye.\" So resist means retaliation, revenge, and tit for tat. \"Resist\" means if you hit me, I hit you. So Jesus is arguing that we should *not* \"return evil for evil.\"  \n  \nSo I'd argue that Jesus isn't using the word \"resist\" in the broadest sense that we would. \"Passive resistance\" is not an oxymoron in our language, but it is an ironic concept.  \n  \nBut here is information about the Greek word for \"resist\" here https://biblehub.com/greek/436.htm :\n  \n> 436 anth\u00edst\u0113mi (from 473 /ant\u00ed, \"opposite/against\" and 2476 /h\u00edst\u0113mi, \"to stand\") \u2013 properly, take a complete stand against, i.e. a \"180 degree, contrary position\"; (figuratively) to establish one's position publicly by conspicuously \"holding one's ground,\" i.e. refusing to be moved (\"pushed back\").  \n> 436 /anth\u00edst\u0113mi (\"oppose fully\") means to forcefully declare one's personal conviction (where they unswervingly stand); to keep one's possession; ardently withstand, without giving up (letting go).  \n> [436 (anth\u00edst\u0113mi) was a military term in classical Greek (used by Thucydides, etc.) meaning \"to strongly resist an opponent\" (\"take a firm stand against\").]  \n  \nIn a context of Roman society of the ancient world, I'd argue that the idea of \"passive resistance\" would sound far more like an oxymoron. \"To resist\" meant to not give up *any* ground without a fight. But Jesus is saying the opposite of that. Absolutely *do* concede ground. Take the hit. He isn't calling for a strength that prevents attack, but a strength that withstands it and gets pushed. If you are getting pushed (but are still standing), then by definition you aren't just falling over. So we could differentiate between \"resistance\" and \"repellance\" here - their society would primarily think about the latter, but Jesus is actively calling against the latter. That doesn't mean he is also calling against the former.  \n\nPut this in the context of the 1st century, and in the context of the early Church, and you can see application of the idea. Jesus did not oppose the Romans. He didn't advocate overthrowing Rome, and didn't support political action or terrorism (even though Zealot movements were very popular in the region). Christians weren't trying to overthrow Rome or \"oppose\" Caesar. But Christians had no problem with being a thorn in the side of the Romans. They stirred the pot plenty. They just didn't use force or violence to do it.",

            "body": "The Trump team took presidential records upon leaving the White House, just as every president in modern history has done. \n\nThe argument used by the Biden administration and the media was that Trump didn't follow proper procedures for the declassification of documents. \n\nThe issue with that argument is those procedures don't apply to the sitting President, only to subordinates. The President is free to declassify any document, at any time, for any reason, in any manner he sees fit.\n\nTrump's standing order at the time was that his own records were automatically considered declassified once removed from the White House. \n\nNo one has the authority to contradict the sitting President in such procedures, therefore the documents he left with were declassified. \n\nMonths into the Biden administration, more boxes of documents were delivered to to Mar a Lago. \n\nTrump was told those were his documents. \n\nIf I remember the time line correctly, that's when the conversation with the National Archives started.\n\nThe issue is that the back and forth with the National Archives was nonsense from the start, as an executive order by Obama, that Trump left in place, had all original records go to the Archives. \n\nIn other words, Trump only ever had duplicates in his office, and those are what he took.\n\nUnless of course originals or documents that weren't declassified were delivered to him by someone in the Biden administration. \n\nThat does seem to be plausible, as the charges were filed almost immediately after the delivery by the Biden administration. \n\nThen, during the raid, the boxes were opened, documents removed, put on the floor, and photographed with cover sheets.\n\nThat's the infamous photo. The documents were then placed back in the box out of order.\n\nJack Smith's team had to admit to tampering with evidence due to the existence of those photos.",

This isn't just Trump, more prosecutors should be charged with crimes when they knowingly go after innocent people because they want a conviction. When they withhold exculpatory evidence because their career matters more than the truth. That is one of the primary issues with the criminal justice system. The state has unlimited funds and power to contort the evidence against you with no ramifications. If prosecutors were personally liable for their actions more they would be far more likely to be fair in their prosecutions.",
