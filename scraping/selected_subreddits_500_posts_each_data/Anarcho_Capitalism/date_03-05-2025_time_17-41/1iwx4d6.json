Failure to do that will be enforced by the code enforcement, and since the penalty can\u2019t be eviction, the only solution is\u2026 jail.

It has been administered by Croatia since the Croatian War of Independence.[8] Liberland has no diplomatic recognition from any recognized nation.[9] The land lacks infrastructure and lies on the floodplain of the Danube.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberland",

But it's imperative that the state becomes a player in the economy acting like a consume-cooperative you opt into for property rights and offers free-market alternatives to the basic stuff for life, like healthcare, education and housing. This would already give strong competition and standards in the market without forcing birocracy heavy regulations.",

Then, some investment group in Plano, Texas bought it out and replaced the management company. They wanted me out so they could raise the rent on my unit.

If the TV is in your property (that you own, rent, maintain etc rightfully) then no one is in their right to take it. Since your property is your own private space that other people can't trespass on or use without your permission. (This doesn't mean that someone else forfeits ownership of something that is reasonably theirs and usable if they bring their phone into your house or anything, they just can't claim ownership of something that's in yours).\n\nIf you leave the TV outside of your property and it's broken down and doesn't work, then it's fair to consider it derelict and someone else can take it.\n\n>And what is the time frame I should have to do that, is it exactly after a year I don't fix it ?\n\nThe time frame in which the property is livable while you perform no maintenance on it. Since property usually needs windows, doors, temperature control, electricity plumbing etc, it will be until enough of those things have failed that it can't be reasonably used for living. I think in a few months, nature will take the area back with plant growth and animal invasions to the point that it's clearly derelict and unlivable unless someone else comes in and fixes all that.",

Since property usually needs windows, doors, temperature control, electricity plumbing etc, it will be until enough of those things have failed that it can't be reasonably used for living.\n\nSo, if I go on vacations, a natural disaster happens and destroys my house, and someone fixes it before I come back, or puts a trailer on it, it is suddenly their property now ?\n\nYour idea of ownership based on maintenance is full of holes that enable people to steal the property from others, and also have literally no point of fairness and would never be accepted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit- Have to edit cuz the other guy blocked me.\n\n>Nope I didn't say you could just take someone else's property. You won't ignore it, and you won't mischaracterize what I said.\n\nFirst of all pretty scummy of you to block me so I can't answer back. I did not mischaracterize what you said, I think you yourself don't understand the implications of the subjective idea of property you just propossed. because it can totally happen. And you being offended and refused to adress the point won't change that.\n\n\n>Nope, because you can work to fix the house. If you abandon it and aren't trying to fix it in a reasonable period of time, you don't.\n\nBut that's my intent, others can't know my intentions. It is intent then, what decides if something is property ? how do I prove intent ? What is a reasonable period of time ? A few months ? What if I was saving and took vacations for months ?\nAgain, you are just adjusting your idea of property to whatever relative situation to not admit it's full of holes and completely invalid once put to test.\n\n\n>You're really struggling here.\n\nAm I ? That's why you blocked me ? How generous of you.\n\n\n>Nope, your understanding is though, and you deliberately lied about what I said and said you'd ignore my correction, so now you're ignored.\n\nI haven't lied, and I didn't ignore your \"correction\". You still refuse to deal in dialectics and have an intelligent conversation. Way to prove your point. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n>I think you aren't getting the underlying point. What it means is that\u00a0*after some (long) period of time,*\u00a0the property is considered abandoned by the previous owner.\n\nI got the point, however the problem with this is that said *long period of time* it's completely subjective and prone to personal interpretation. It cannot be thus, a nonspoken rule, not even a law.\n\n>Just like throwing some broken TV in the woods.\n\nWhat about people who brings a portable TV to a campsite and stop using it? What about cars, those are usually parked public and not inside your property. I know a guy who's got the same car brocken parked outside his house for two years now, if I go and fix is can I steal it from him ? Etc.\n\n>There has to be at least some constant interaction and causal connection with the thing.\n\nWhy ? How is this NOT a subjective interpretation of what property is ? Why should I accept it that you are now the owner of my car I was saving to finally fix one day, instead of  just shoot you for stealing what's mine ?\n\n>Or you could just pay someone to maintain it, protect it, and such. That's what a private protection would do.\n\nOh cool idea, we could even call that a government of sorts ! we could pay them protection for our stuff ( taxes ), so they ensure they are still ours even if we don't use them ! /s\n\nSo basically you want to pay taxes to make a government ensure my property rights. In other words I'm not owner of my propriety, the government is, and once I stop or can't pay they will steal it from me.\n\n>Moreover, an Anarcho-Capitalist society has governance. Private tribunals and protection agencies. These organizations will surely stipulate at least a range of time and destruction a piece of property can go by until it becomes forfeit. That is, the owner pays a notary to even prove/recognize he owns said property, and a tribunal to solve judicial disputes. Those organizations will have voluntary agreements to solve that sort of scenario.\n\nAnd why would I voluntarily ever form part of a society so damn stupid, I have to pay extra just to be owner of my own stuff ?\n\n>If you still disagree, how do you propose we solve this issue?\n\nIf I pay for something or built something in my terrain then it's mine. Try to take it, I'll use force to defend it.",

What it means is that *after some (long) period of time,* the property is considered abandoned by the previous owner. As in, they fail to go there, make any sort of repair, for several years/decades. Just like throwing some broken TV in the woods. A house is just a more complicated object. In other words, we can't simply own any and everything we ever touch/use for the rest if time. There has to be at least some constant interaction and causal connection with the thing. So, indeed, if your house gets destroyed and you never go back there or even make a point of restoring it, it will be considered abandoned eventually. Or you could just pay someone to maintain it, protect it, and such. That's what a private protection would do.\n\nMoreover, an Anarcho-Capitalist society has governance.

Those organizations will have voluntary agreements to solve that sort of scenario.\n\nOtherwise, it would be Pure Anarchy. In Pure Anarchy, the only technical property one can own is their bodies and what they are carrying. Because things such as land, buildings, and objects would have no way of having a proven owner. It would be \"I own this place because I am usually here, protecting it.\" \n\nAnd no, I don't think Pure Anarchy can work. It actually makes conflicts worse. It's just an extreme example to explain why anarchy is not the lack of all rules, but instead non-aggression supported by agreements and contracts that can be valid for every single person.\n\nIf you still disagree, how do you propose we solve this issue?",

Likewise you can own an object that you didn't make yourself if the person who made it (or other rightful owner) gave it to you or traded it to you. Someone else said \"what if I want to buy a patch of land just to have a walk,\" you can't buy the patch of land in the first place if it's undeveloped, no one owns it, and as a result, you're welcome to walk in it as long as you don't stop anybody else from doing so too (or otherwise mess it up).",

No one is saying \"stop evicting people who don't pay rent\", they are clearly saying \"If I've signed a 1 year tenancy contract with a Landlord, why does the government allow him to evict me before this agreement has come to an end?\".\n\nSurely you can see this? A contract is a contract and you shouldn't be able to get evicted within the time that you have agreed to pay money for a service, over a contract no-less. Without a government contracts essentially \\*are\\* the law, but the government gives people exceptions to get out of these contracts. \n\nThe same goes for the tenant leaving early, he has agreed to pay for a year and should have to pay for entire year.\n\nNo-fault evictions are something else and I believe if the contract is up and you haven't followed up with a new 1 year lease, or however long, the Landlord is of course within his rights, but again, no one is talking about \"not paying rent\", at most it's about early evictions, and potentially no-fault evictions, which in lots of cases are fair so you can criticise them for this.",

I rented the larger side and lived in the smaller. During COVID the renters quit paying rent and made no effort to get any of the assistance that was available. The government made it very difficult to do an eviction due to rules to \"protect tenants\". After 8 months I was finally able to get them evicted, doing the legal work all on my own. By that point I was so far behind financially and they had so badly trashed the place I had to sell it \"as is\" costing me as much as $100,000 of my equity. Fortunately I don't have major mental or emotional issues and my girlfriend was happy to have me move in with her.\n\nI am a human.",
