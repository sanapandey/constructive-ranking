For pointing out how they made money by shuttering small businesses while the giant ones stayed open thanks to government, and even received funding. \n\n\nI will never, for my whole ass life, forget the shit I read and saw from 2020-2022 (fucking mandates were still in place in large cities until the Ukraine conflict finally kicked in.)

Half the stuff I saw during 2020-2021 I can't seem to find anymore.\n\nBut yeah, having just a basic understanding of science really drove a wedge between me and family members, friends, and society. When I said, no that piece of paper or cloth isn't stopping an aerosolized virus from getting into the air I would get dog piled.\n\nHaving a natural skepticism of a drug brought to the public under emergency conditions without anywhere close to the amount of testing *every other drug undergoes*, and having people tell me I'm a conspiracy theorist.... it was fucking nuts. They hid tons of the trial data. They lied about the vaccine efficacy and then tried to pretend that the lack of efficacy was *always known* or *it's just a new strain that's why*. \n\n\"It was never meant to stop you from getting covid.\"\n\n\"It was never intended to prevent transmission of covid.\"\n\nBull. Fucking. Shit. Both claims were made and then memory holed after they got out with billions in cash.\n\nMeanwhile the govt forced people to get the **still experimental** drug or lose your job, and we had the mini-autocrats in our society yelling in unison \"It's not mandatory you have a choice to just not work!\" \n\nIt was then that I realized that my countrymen wanted to see me dead and we were not fellows to the same cause.",

From there, a good place to go would be Machinery of Freedom by David Friedman, son of Milton Friedman, to get more answers to more common criticisms.\n\nUntil you do that, it's just a waste of time to answer your questions.

Though, if you show up with a completely bastardized straw man version of the views and parade how little you've tried to understand it by learning on your own, don't feel entitled to having your hand held while someone explains it all to you. Reddit is astroturfed beyond reason and the 2% of subs not overrun with psychotic leftist bullshit get overrun by psychotic conservative bullshit. This is one of like 2 subs where liberty focused people can congregate and discuss stuff without it getting socially nuked by hysterical people who haven't had an original thought in their life. \n\nThe issue is that you haven't properly defined anarchism. It is not abject lawlessness and every man for himself - though some here may prefer that flavor of anarchism I think it's a bit naive. Most would define it as a system that eliminates institutionalized coercion or authority. This doesn't mean institutions cannot exist, it means they'll cease to exist once they stop serving the people who make them up and they'll never come into existence through the use of force. As one person responded: there is an incentive for private companies to develop and maintain things like roads. People organize without government direction all the damn time. When your capital cannot be raised through theft (taxes) but instead has to be earned through delivering a product or service people voluntarily support or use, you will out perform the institution running on theft 100% of the time. \n\nFor what its worth, I'd wager most folks here would happily accept concessions short of privatizing all the roads. Whats bewildering is that people who desperately want to reject an-caps, libertarians, minarchists, etc. all jump to what they perceive to be the most painful part of the switch as if they were irreplaceable by a more efficient private sector (mind you, the private sector is contracted to build the roads) or as if we'd have to give up 100% of those things. Lets keep your dream of still letting some small government inefficiently build the roads... can you see how there are other parts of the government we absolutely do not need?",

The dramatic majority of which absolutely do not pursue a monopoly of any sorts. The huge corporations which do are generally achieving that via special interest policy which is written on their behalf after they lobby our politicians. So for the sake of the thought experiment lets pretend they were all nefarious and driving toward regulatory capture that allowed their monopolies... how do they achieve that without government intervention barring competition from entering the field?  \n\nI don't think people here will say we've had any semblance of the free market we want for a long time if ever. \n\nWhere did this notion of fairness and equality come into the discussion? Friend I think you're making the common mistake of confusing the definition of \"equality.\" Equality means equal rights and equal value of a life. That is equality everyone here agrees with and supports. \n\nNot the bastardized and politically weaponized childish notion of equality which has come to mean \"equal opportunities\" or even more asinine \"equal outcomes.\" I'll give you the benefit of the doubt you're not 14 years old and thinking the government can provide equal outcomes for people who are making unequal decisions and taking unequal actions... but lets say you fell for the first bait and think \"equal opportunities\" is something we achieve through regulation... Who is the arbiter of what's equal? Our government which is made up of the same type of people who work at the DMV? How well have the police applied equality in their actions? How exactly do we quantify or qualify the equalness of opportunities? If I come from a household with a single mother how do we (the government) ameliorate the advantage you have coming from a two parent household and should we? Where does it stop? What if I'm ugly and unpleasant while you're handsome and charming? You'll have far more opportunities than I will. What laws should we write to fix that? \n\nHopefully you get the point. Meanwhile the folks here think the system they endorse provides the greatest opportunities to the widest spectrum of people and it doesn't discriminate in anyway. \n\nEthically it's a great social goal to help lift people up in severely disadvantaged positions, but nobody should be forced to do that, especially not through law. And the government will be wholly ineffective in executing on that no matter how much of our money they waste trying to do so. \n\nBasically it's a propagandistic tool to have folks like you convinced that folks like us don't care about less advantaged people having opportunity. We do. We just think the system you want is exactly the wrong way to get there and it fucks over everyone else along the way. \n\nIf Saudi Arabia has oil and (pretend) we don't, then we buy oil from them or someone else who will sell it to us, we develop other energy sources, we don't inhabit parts of the world with no resources to sustain life, and we get good at producing something else to create value we can trade with. But Saudi Arabia didn't get their oil through theft so why the hell would anyone else have a right to it? Otherwise, what? We go and \"liberate\" those nations who have things we want so we can disseminate them as we see fit? Ya I'm not keen on being world police or being the global hegemony invading other countries.",

If you use the roads and do not pay, that will be enforced by the private company that is employed by the road company.\n\nIf I or you disagree with something that a private company is doing, it is simple as withdrawal of payments and using an alternative service.",

There are many right ways to go about this.\n\nLet's say that company A begins to drop the ball on road maintenance over their fixed term 1 year contract. The following year, company B wins the contract by the people paying for using the roads as they have more confidence in their abilities. A community contract system is most likely the way residential roadways will be maintained. People who paid for road use, will elect the company to maintain their roads. People within the community may use the road under a yearly payment, however people outside that community may be tolled to enter. There is large incentive for the company to do a job conclusively, as it is potentially lucrative. Yet, as there is such great competition, they have to be quick to resolve any problems.\n\nLarge highways are likely privately owned privately. For example, a cross country highway is built privately. The highway company owns the land the highway is built on also.  The highway is tolled as such. If this company starts to increase prices and demand goes up. An alternative route may be constructed by a different company with a lower price. The original company adjusts their price as they lose some business.\n\nThe point is, there is extreme competition to produce a good service or product. The people are given large power to influence who is in control of what, not the government.",

You may provide 70% to company A and then 30% to company B in case company A screws up.\n\nI guarantee you, most wars are started by higher ups, not by the will of the people. Politicians don't go to war, the people do.\n\nYou are correct in saying the military with the most strength will have the most control. However, without money they will have no control. Imagine if Lockheed Martin was receiving $2 million per day and all of a sudden they decide to invade Germany. Then the next day, everyone who disapproves, pulls funding from Lockheed Martin. Maybe they only receive, $100,000 per day, not enough to keep a war moving that's for sure. How does Lockheed pay their employees? They can't, the employees stop working for Lockheed.\n\nFURTHERMORE...\n\nLet's say I live in a different country and disapprove of the actions taken by the Tonga people. Contract company A determines an internal survey to the people funding it whether they should intervene. If the answer is overwhelming yes, then they will perform those operations.\n\nThis is the only ABSOLUTE way to determine what people want.
