The real problem here is illegal aliens coming in, having large numbers of children and using benefits.   \n\nChat GPT did a wraparound costs for the 12 million illegal aliena and assuming 4 kids each it costs around 50 TRILLION dollars over 18 years to provide all the benefits they will use.\n\nHERE GOES:\n\nI got back, appears around $1 million per child from birth to 18.  Of the 12 million illegals only had an average of two kids per couple, that would cost around $12 trillion over 18 years, plus the costs of their parents benefits.  Most likely it\u2019s more like 4-5 kids on average.  My guess is more like $50 trillion over 18 years or 2-3 trillion per year.\n\nThe total cost of a child born to an undocumented immigrant in California depends on various factors, including the specific benefits received, the duration of support, and the administrative costs involved. However, estimates vary widely depending on the assumptions used.\n\nHere\u2019s a general breakdown of potential costs:\n\t1.\tEducation (K-12 & Head Start):\n\t\u2022\tThe average annual cost per student in California public schools is around $18,000 (varies by district).\n\t\u2022\tOver 13 years (K-12): $234,000\n\t\u2022\tHead Start (2 years): Around $20,000 total\n\t2.\tHealthcare:\n\t\u2022\tIf covered by Medi-Cal, the cost varies, but for a child, it could be around $3,000 - $5,000 per year, totaling $54,000 - $90,000 over 18 years.\n\t\u2022\tBirth and maternal care: $10,000 - $25,000 (if covered by public programs).\n\t3.\tFood Assistance:\n\t\u2022\tIf eligible for CalFresh (food stamps) & WIC, benefits could total $3,000 - $6,000 per year, or about $54,000 - $108,000 over 18 years.\n\t4.\tHousing Assistance:\n\t\u2022\tIf receiving Section 8 or similar aid, annual costs might be $10,000 - $20,000, potentially totaling $180,000 - $360,000 over 18 years.\n\t5.\tCash & Welfare Benefits:\n\t\u2022\tPrograms like TANF might provide $4,000 - $7,000 per year, totaling $72,000 - $126,000 over 18 years.\n\t6.\tLegal & Administrative Costs:\n\t\u2022\tCourt, law enforcement, and administrative costs vary widely but could be $5,000 - $20,000 per case.\n\nEstimated Total Lifetime Cost (Birth to 18) in California:\n\nLow estimate: ~$500,000\nHigh estimate: $1,000,000+\n\nThese estimates are highly dependent on actual benefits received, and not all children born to undocumented parents qualify for all these programs. Additionally, children born in the U.S. are citizens and may contribute to the economy over time. Would you like specific sources or more details?",

                            "body": "Your original statement isn't deep enough though. It implies that this concept known as \"open borders\" is associated with the borders of a nation.\n\nThe thing is, if you can't see the government as not really real then the idea of open borders pertains only to the imaginary lines of a nation. In this context where the nationals pay taxes for public services, it makes prudent sense to restrict access to both the land within the state and to the public services themselves.\n\nThe mere posting of this itself is kind of redundant because if your position is that the state is illegitimate then all land is publicly owned anyway, and we don't need to announce that an NAP position is that people cannot violate your property rights. A violation of property rights is a cardinal example of aggression.\n\nThe existence of the idea that is the state conflicts with your statement because for instance, if there were a government in which received all funding through 100% consent, then non-open borders would be completely legitimate and would not violate the NAP at all. If you and I consent to co-own a property, we still own that property by way of private property (the only actual type of property mind you, rendering the \"private\" in that phrase as redundant). If it's our property, then it likely doesn't have open borders unless we desire it to.\n\nSo even if 440 million people all consent to a single company who we all donate to, and that one entity is the relative monopoly on the use of force and we all consent to allow that entity to function the exact same way the current US government does (for example), and they choose to close borders, then that is not a violation of the NAP.\n\nThe ONLY thing that differentiates a government that is illegitimate and tyrannical from one that is not is consent. In theory, if you could get every single person in the US today for example to just sign a consent form saying that the way our government works today is legitimate in their eyes, then suddenly the entire thing becomes legitimate and a LOT changes.\n\nBeing taxed is the initiation of the illegitimacy of the state. The second we consent to giving up that income we no longer call it a tax, it now becomes a donation, or a payment for services being rendered.",
