    "selftext": "The NPC programming today is to talk about how Musk doesn't understand how COBOL works. Evidently it defaults to 1875 when a field is blank. This is supposed to explain the 150 year-olds listed as still alive in the SS database.\n\nHowever, there are, according to DOGE, many born before 1875 listed as alive. COBOL doesn't explain this, and when I point out that COBOL doesn't explain this, I get crickets.",

No IRS agents is necessary for that.

The return is examined and part of the money stolen from you is returned.\n\n\nSo yes, there are parts of the IRS which directly steal from people, and then there are parts which work on returning a portion of that stolen money.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you move toward sales tax and tariffs those are all taxes which are going to inevitably come out of your pocket without a single IRS agent ever even thinking about you.\n\n\nI get that it's easy to think \"IRS is thief, drr\", but that's why the show of cutting 5000 jobs or 10000 jobs from the IRS works.

It tries to explain why all these old people are in the system but not labeled as deceased, but most notably it states that 44,000 born before 1920 are still receiving benefits (footnote 7 on page 2). According to [this list](https://gerontology.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_oldest_living_people_in_the_United_States), there are only 15 known people in the US over the age of 112.\n\nSo it doesn't seem like there's millions of people fraudulently receiving benefits, but it does look like there's at least 44,000.\n\nEDIT: People born in 1920 would only be 102 at the time of this report, and there are actually a lot more 100 year old people than I thought. There were 80,000 in 2020. So that 44k doesn't seem that wrong now.",

Do you think they only realized they needed to capture a deceased date *after* they started writing the software? Or do you think they just had a birthdate and a boolean if the person were ALIVE and just guess at when they died? Do you also believe they had something like \"eyeColorBlue?\" set to FALSE and \"eyeColorGreen?\" set to FALSE and \"eyeColorBrown?\" set to TRUE? Or do you think it's more likely they would use a varchar to set \"eyeColor\"? It seems far more likely you're just grasping at straws than having the capability to say \"I made a mistake\".",
