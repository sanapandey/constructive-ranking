Quite clearly explained, no need for interpretation. \n\nThe \u201chistory of the entire period\u201d is also an  assumption, when it just as easily describes the persecution of Antiochus IV and from a prophetic sense used by Jesus, that of the Romans after the destruction of the temple and the establishment of the Church. Making it about a thousand plus year stretch happens after you make the you say \u201cwell unlike every other place in the Bible, when he says day he really meant year\u201d, which is yet again an exact example of the kind of post-hoc retconnig of the Bible that leads people into error.\n\nIt like how people read the son of man \u201cfrom Daniel and make that about the end of days, when the plain reading is that this is about His ascension \n\nDaniel 7:13-14 (The key passage)\n\t\u201cI saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven\nthere came one like a son of man,\nand he came to the Ancient of Days\nand was presented before him.\nAnd to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,\nthat all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him.\u201d\n\nThe Son of Man \u201ccomes\u201d not to Earth but to God (the Ancient of Days). This is a heavenly enthronement scene, not a return to Earth.\n\nThe dominion given to him is everlasting\u2014there\u2019s no indication of a departure and later return. \n\nYou can get the sense of this as you see how the expectation of immanence of the end of days fades from the urgency in Mark, to The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, nor will they say, \u2018Look, here it is!\u2019 or \u2018There!\u2019 for behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst in Luke. \n\nLikewise Paul\u2019s epistles show how he expected the end of days in his lifetime in Thessalonians and how that changed in Phillipians. \n\nThere is not ONE instance in the Synoptics  or John where Jesus himself claims or describes the Parousia and every other instance in Acts, Paul\u2019s epistles, Peter\u2019s epistles and Revelations are all deeply inconsistent, with Revelations in particular being more of a rewriting of Enoch (not canonical) than an original work. \n\nEven if you do stick to the days = years why stick to the dome of the rock rather than the temple of Jupiter that was built by Hadrian which is a much better fit given Daniel\u2019s writing about Antiochus IV\u2019s desecration via idolatry was almost exactly mirrored there, than an iconoclastic Islamic building with zero idols or images of any kind. ?",

The region of Judea has been under Muslim control since the fall of the Roman empire besides for a brief period during the crusades 1099-1187 where it was again under Muslim control until the British took control over the region following ww1. In short based on the 689 the start of the construction of the dome of the rock and the 1260 days in revelations we get 1949 the year after Isreal was reestablish.

The conflict isn\u2019t just about ideology or historical grievances. Geography plays a major role, making it easier for militants to plan and launch attacks. Removing that proximity would create logistical and strategic difficulties, forcing them to operate from a distance with far less effectiveness.\n\nOf course, this wouldn\u2019t put an end to the conflict. Ideology is a powerful driver, and those committed to the cause will always look for new ways to sustain it. But without immediate access, their ability to organize, infiltrate, and carry out attacks would be severely weakened.\n\nThat said, actually making this happen is another story. Vetting and deradicalizing an entire population is incredibly difficult. Some people might hide their true beliefs, and forced reeducation could backfire, deepening resentment rather than erasing it. On top of that, relocating millions of people would face huge logistical challenges and international outrage. Most countries wouldn\u2019t want to take in displaced Palestinians, especially if they were labeled a security risk.\n\nSome might see this as a harsh but necessary step to end bloodshed, while others would argue that forcing people out of their homeland would only fuel further unrest. Even if it worked to some extent, it wouldn\u2019t be a perfect solution. At best, it might make large-scale violence harder to sustain, but it wouldn\u2019t erase the conflict itself",

If a population has not inhabited an area for almost 2,000 years, then their claim is invalid, as I\u2019ve stated previously, the Arabs were the ones to initially established the infrastructure and economy in the levant when the caliphates took control.\n\n2.) They did try to establish ownership, however the Sykes-Picot agreement occurred in 1916, meaning the British seized Palestine after WWI.\n\n3.) Your logic is built upon fabrications made up by Zionists who mean to rewrite the historical narrative for their ideological benefit, while discarding the truth.\n\n4.) As I stated previously, you have no right or claim to a piece of land if you and your people have not been there in over 2,000 years. The families of modern Israelis only have a history of 70 years max, while Arabs (Palestinians) will have roughly a thousand years of history built upon that because of the caliphates seizing the area from the Eastern Romans during their conquest.\n\n5.) I was waiting for this one: \"everything that is said against the government Israel is antisemitic,\" no, I\u2019m not being antisemitic, I\u2019ve studied the history of this issue and looked at cultural and survey maps from the 1800s-1910s along with reading historical documents I can also provide you a video that condenses this information into a digestible experience, Manly Man Does History made a good video on the subject.\n\n6.) The name \"Palestine\" was in usage during the time of the nomadic Hebrew tribes (variations of the name being used way back in 3000 B.C.). No, Palestine was never a fully independent state, but neither was Israel, in fact it is heavily debated to suggest that there was a \"unified Israel\" during antiquity because of the lack of archeological evidence and documentation (primary sources). In reality the two kingdoms lingering were Samaria and Judea (even then they didn\u2019t last long); this is what we have evidence for. Palestine was the name of the region for thousands of years: Greek, Canaanite, Persian, and Roman scholars have documented it as such.",

Yes, lots of heinous evil happened in the before times, but after the league of nations, we (the west) had some standards to what was acceptable in wartime, and ethnic cleansing never was. Yes, yes, nazis, and all that, but that was never acceptable behavior, and when they didn't conquer the world, they were stopped, and we undid the land, art, and other property seizures, as much as possible.\n\nLets get to UK having the right to the land of Palestine. They did NOT 'inherit the land' from the Turks, they had military control over it, there is a LARGE difference. Having political control over a territory does NOT give you legal title to civilian land, in a civilized society, that still belongs to the citizens, and has to be purchased legally, if it is to be transferred.\n\n\"Israel lawfully owns it now.\" Israel's ownership of the land is about as legal as German claims to own the northern half of France. This was a purely seizing of civilian land by force, and a decent society would set this back to its rightful owners, even if they are now forced to live inside the conquering country, just like we did with stolen French and Polish territory after WW 2, and even then, the allies didn't ethnically cleanse the land that was legally owned by German citizens in parts of Germany that were given to other nations, even if those civilians were incorporated into countries with newly drawn borders.\n\nTry to separate the macro from the micro here. Conquered territory, ok, stealing real property from civilians after conquering territory, not ok, this is in the UN charter of Human Rights, and right to your property IS a human right !",

Realistically that is not always possible, but it IS possible in this (Israel/Hamas)conflict, and I think we should do it. Clearly there are other displaced peoples all over the world, and I think they should have the right of return as well, but in many cases that is not possible, just because of the utter savagery of their homelands, I'm thinking Afghanistan here, but I'm sure it applies to other places as well, likely including the Ukraine conflict, even if there is a permanent settlement that includes permanent land concessions, the CIVILIANS that own parts of any surrendered land should legally be allowed to return and live on it, even if it is now inside another country, although if Russia does not cooperate, that could be difficult, and they have historically not cooperated with civilian resettlements, even going back to WW2.",

That's what \"ethnical cleaning\" means.\n\n\\> \u00a0doubt most of the people, or even more than 5 % of them, had any knowledge of what was going to happen with the unjust attack on mostly civilians\n\nI doubt that's true. Why would Israel not attack back? But even if >95% of people in Gaza are this stupid, it wouldn't change anything. It was a retaliation to an attack they started and supported. When you start a war, you can't claim anything because you didn't know what the counter attack would look like.  \n\n\n\\> Its not unlike when the organized Mexican drug cartels cross the US border an kill some border agents\n\nIt's completely unlike it. Drug cartels are not the state and Mexican people hate the cartels more than anything. On the other hand, Hamas control the Gaza strip, they are the state and they did it because the vast majority of the population approves them and votes for them massively in every single election.\n\n\\> I don't blame all of Mexico, or its citizens that own land on the border\n\nAs you shouldn't.\n\n\\> that does NOT justify stealing private land from civilians\n\nThey started this war. They lost it. It's what happens. It's over. It's war. We're not discussing the ethics of ancapistan here. It's not peaceful private land. It's a zone being used to attack millions of people for decades. And they showed no intention to stop whatsoever. And the land isn't worth anything anyway. They'll get a better deal somewhere else, which is way more than they deserve.\n\n\\> some glorified criminals\n\nHamas are not glorified criminals. They are the state. They started a war and lost it. And it's not a state people dislike and must be protected from. It's a state with overwhelming support of the population. Maybe some <5% of people in Gaza don't support Hamas and they'll pay this price, which is unfortunate. But that's how life is when you live in a place where a stupid government with massive support from stupid people makes stupid decisions. If they don't like Hamas, they'll get a better deal anyway.",

You are assigning mass guilt to an entire population, which is just not the way the world is anymore, as embodied in the agreed to conventions of war.\n\nIs Russia following these guidelines to the letter in Ukraine ? Of course not, but that country isn't really considered part of civilized society anymore, no matter how many nukes they have, it still doesn't make it right, not for Russia, not for Israel, and not for us, if we actually are dumb enough to try to put our hands into this beehive, and try to score some political honey...",
