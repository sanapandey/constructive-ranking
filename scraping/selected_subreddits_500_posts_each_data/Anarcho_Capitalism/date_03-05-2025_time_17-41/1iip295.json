Clinton did 273k workers at $25k each ($53k in 2025 dollars).\n\nTrump is doing it with 8 months severance. In 2025, the US federal worker average salary is $106k. So at 8 months severance that is an average cost of $71k. Trump\u2019s plan is nearly one-third higher cost per worker than Clinton\u2019s using 2025 equivalent costs.",

Looks like Clinton\u2019s was better.\n\nThe federal workforce currently consists of approximately **2.4 million employees**, excluding military personnel and U.S. Postal Service workers[1][2]. President Trump has proposed reducing this workforce by **10%**, which would amount to cutting around 240,000 jobs[1][7]. \n\nHis administration has implemented measures such as a hiring freeze, \u201cbuyout\u201d offers, and a deferred resignation program to encourage voluntary departures. So far, about **65,000 workers** have expressed intent to resign under these initiatives, though this falls short of the administration\u2019s target of 5-10% reductions[2][3].\n\nSources\n[1] Trump wants to cut the federal workforce.

You guys love big government when they're on your side. Again, look it up, Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Trump said he wants to invoke it, and the law literally says it allows the president to lock up people simply based on their nationality, no trial needed, no criminal conviction needed.\n\nIt's crazy how you guys think Trump is awsome because he shut down USAID but you have no problem with him literally wanting to have the power to imprison people without a trial, and use the same law that was used for Japanese internment camps.",

This is why tech is always cited in these examples - tech allows for these highly narrow skill sets to thrive, but people forget just how narrow and non-transferable this type of efficiency is. A good Jenkins engineer can setup a pipeline for you in 5 minutes instead of 5 hours, but ask him to design an AWS SCP and he\u2019s likely just as inefficient any other average tech. Tech is a classic example, but the same dynamic exists in any specialization. A neurosurgeon may be a genius, but you don\u2019t ask him to evaluate the stress vectors on a skyscraper core structure. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing does not work in areas where skills and output are highly interchangeable. You cannot get the DMV running twice as fast by firing all but the fastest workers, because even the best ones are only a few percentage points above average. You just cause more and more backlog. \n\nHell\u2026 look at Twitter/X. Elon took that over, purged the staff, cut costs, has engineering working burnout hours\u2026 and it\u2019s hemorrhaging money. His last all hands email was leaked and said that revenue is way below a sustainable level (aka: they\u2019re going broke). \n\nBeing more efficient isn\u2019t shit if you can\u2019t get the job done.",
