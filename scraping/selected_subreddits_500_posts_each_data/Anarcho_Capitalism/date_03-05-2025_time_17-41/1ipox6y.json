The confusing part is that the way these are written the timeline of events goes as such: (1) Mexican president claims US guns are coming down across the border and points to US gun stores as accomplices. (2) Mexican president will pursue legal action against gun stores in specific states/manufacturers if cartels are  labeled foreign terrorist organizations. (3) US president threatens Mexican President with labeling cartels are terrorist organizations if she pursues legal actions against gunmakers.\n\nIt\u2019s the use of the phrase \u201cMeanwhile Trump threatens to\u2026\u201d that sounds like the above order of events is happening. Something sounds off about it all and I feel like we are missing an event before the first one listed above.\n\nAlso, I have noticed this sub is getting a lot of pictures of sections of news articles or headlines with no sources. I get that everyone wants to bitch and moan about current events, but can we all agree to site sources in one form or fashion?",
