The thing is, if you argue that freedom isn't capitalism that's fine, but that's just a semantics argument.\n\nI'm not even sure what communism is, to be honest. Communists will tell you that it's a moneyless, stateless society, but when asked to define their terms they can't. You can't not have money because money is just subjective value and a tally of what people have done for other people.",
