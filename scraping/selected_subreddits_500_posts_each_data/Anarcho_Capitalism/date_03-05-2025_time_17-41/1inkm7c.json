You have to communicate with people in a way both of you can understand, if that includes shifting your language so that you aren't misunderstood, maybe it's worth the difficulties involved. \n\nSlowly take back the word capitalism, by being very clear about what we mean when we say it, and asking others what they mean, then comparing definitions with them.\n\nMaybe.
