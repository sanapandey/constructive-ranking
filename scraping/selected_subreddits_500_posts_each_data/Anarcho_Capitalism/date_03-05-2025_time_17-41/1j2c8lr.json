Russian authorities claim that an agreement on non-expansion of\u00a0[NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO)\u00a0to\u00a0[Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe)\u00a0took place orally, and that's it. \n\nAnother thing that catches the eye that Ukraine is not viewed as a subject here, with its own sovereignty and interests. The main conflict was not between the USA/West and Russia, but between Ukraine wanting to integrate with Europe, and Russia, which does not respect sovereignty of Ukraine, wanting to influence Ukrainian affairs.",

Are we really going to act as if the statements and promises made by government officials don\u2019t matter unless it\u2019s in writing? That\u2019s just not the way that geo-politics works. \u201cI know we said repeatedly that NATO wouldn\u2019t expand, but nothing was in writing so you can\u2019t be mad\u201d is a crazy way to conduct diplomacy. And you wonder why Russia doesn\u2019t trust the West and would be uneasy about future promises from Western politicians.\n\nUkraine is not a subject here, correct. Ukraine is in a strategically valuable location, that\u2019s all. They will either be a puppet  state of the West or of Russia. That\u2019s just the unfortunate reality. The West doesn\u2019t care about Ukraine at all. They don\u2019t care about democracy. They want to weaken Russia and exploit Ukraine\u2019s resources. I agree that Ukraine is probably better off siding with Europe, than Russia, but to act as if the West is only helping Ukraine out of the goodness of their hearts is absurd.\n\nUkraine is viewed as pawn by both Russia and the West. They can choose to align with whoever they want, but there are consequences involved. Mexico wouldn\u2019t be allowed to join a Russian alliance. Does this mean the US doesn\u2019t respect sovereignty? Wanting to align with the West does not entitle them to do so and doesn\u2019t mean that the West should be naive enough to not expect repercussions for allowing them in.",

And if the US objects to it because the missiles are there to be pointed at the US, then we have an interest in defending ourselves.\n\nBut there's nothing comparable going on here.  Western powers weren't trying to station offensive ICBMs in Ukraine and point them at Russia.  Russia invaded Ukraine out of a desire to maintain its sphere of influence in a country that was breaking away from it.  NATO had nothing to do with it -- no one was even talking about Ukraine joining NATO until *after* Russia started attacking them.",

There is a difference between pointing a loaded gun at someone's kids's bedroom, and having a gun in your house.\n\nAlso just to add to it, Cuba, the Soviet Union and current Rusia are all dictatorships.

NATO will decide which countries can join NATO.  This invasion is part of the Russian foreign policy doctrine, pure and simple.  Everything else is a distraction tactic.\n\n- Russia wants to prevent NATO expansion because it counters their own expansion strategy.\n\n- If Russia creates a border conflict with a nation this de facto prevents NATO accession.\n\n- Russia wants Ukrainian territories for their resources, economic corridors, and strategic shipping and naval bases.\n\n- Putin has consistently engaged in Russian expatriation and emigration followed by destabilization and invasion of neighboring countries.  This is the foreign policy doctrine he calls Sphere of Influence.\n\n- Ancaps who don\u2019t live in an entirely theoretical existence understand that reality dictates they chose sides between conflicting States, and that they should choose the States which are themselves most amenable to being adjusted towards Ancap principles.\n\n-  Russia is not that State.

Notice the speaker in the video doesn't specify the date of the agreement or the parties to the agreement or the name of the treaty.\n\nThe U.S. government did give informal assurances to the SOVIET UNION and Gorbachev not to expand NATO.  (James Baker used the phrase \"not one inch Eastward\" in a famous meeting on Feb  9, 1990).   The video also doesn't mention that declassified documents indicate that both Gorbachev and the Bush administration considered these talks to be about a reunified Germany and not other Eastern European countries.\n\nThe speaker is careful not to mention that when Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland joined NATO in 1999, it was almost 10 years after Baker's and Bush's assurances, or that they were made to a country that NO LONGER EXISTED.\n\nThe speaker makes it seem as though Yeltsin never acknowledged the right of countries to choose there own alliances, which he did, specifically in a speech in Warsaw in 1993.\n\nThe video also goes out of its way to exclude mentioning the NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997 that Yeltsin signed and allowed for new members of NATO. \n\nLots of lies; mostly lies by omission.\n\nBut the big lie is the whole premise: NATO is just America and America grabbed a bunch of countries and crammed them into NATO.  The reality is several Democratic nations voluntarily joined a military alliance  with their European neighbors in the hopes of a peaceful future.\n\nA particularly hilarious lie is that in 2010 Russia had \"no territorial interests or designs on Ukraine at all\".  I can't imagine anyone believing that.\n\nThe speaker in the video goes further with his gaslighting by stating that \"Putin's intention\" when he rolled tanks into Ukraine, a sovereign nation, was to \"force Zelensky to negotiate neutrality\".  How can any reasonable adult believe that was the reason for the invasion?",

Lets be real about back before the 1st invasion, Ukr after the collapse has been a mess of corruption, Ru domination, authoritarian govt, bankrupt govt, and slow economic growth. There was no confidence that Ukr would be a true ally if a war with Ru broke out in Po or Estonia. Half+ of Ukr at that time was very much pro Russian. Even so, the other half of Ukr wanted to join the EU market and get better economic growth. So they got a Constitutional initiative pass that required to accomplish that over the next 10-20yrs.\n\n\n\nBut then the Russian backed party won the election and tried to halt the EU integration & application. This is what sparked millions of Ukranians to join the Maidan protests. Notice how none of this is about NATO? Only a tiny percentage of fringe Ukranians had any interest in joining. But the Russian aligned president fled, and later impeached.\n\n\nBut then the first invasion happened. And Russia faced no significant consequences. Then the second invasion happened in the Donbas region. Literal trainloads of Russian equipment and soldiers prop'ing up a psuedo civil war. Again, NATO is off the table in such a situation. Cant join the alliance with an active war going on like this, even if an unstable ceasefire was active.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBut this is when the collaboration of EU, US and Ukraine began in earnest. That 2nd invasion was a wake up call to the real threat of Russia. No NATO wasnt on the table, but our national guard units were training with them over there to raise their combat capacity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAgain, this is about Ukr making progress to join EU and leaving Russia's sphere of influence, which they felt entitled to forever as a serious world power (i.e. ego). This was the spark of the 3rd, and much larger full scale invasion. This little 3 day war was going to roll Ukraine (little Russia) back under their thumb. Except, thats not how it worked out. The Ukrainians will hate Russia for the next 40 years. And their ability to fight is unquestionable now. That is why NATO is on the table after the 3rd invasion war, but never before.",

Something that wasnt on the table in 2012 is now on the table for 2025 or near term future after the war. After the 3rd invasion, it was clear Ukr had the ability and willingness to fight a common geopolitical opponent at a competentcy level we did not expect. While also pursuing EU integration and political reform to be less authoritarian.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is a golden opportunity to pick up a long term strategic ally that fits well culturally, economically, and geographically to the US and NATO, with strategic benefits. Morally, Ukr has done nothing to warrant these invasions from Ru. They were not a threat, and they have a right to leave Russian alignment for EU alignment. Besides this, thier national identity, culturally, politically, and historically is secure enough that they are stable enough to be a productive partner. In that sense, this isnt like S Vietnam, Iraq,\u00a0Northern Alliance (afghan), various S America boondoggles where its a total shitshow to ally and support them. They are fighting on their own merits and are not even asking for our or EU troops. [Aside: I\u00a0strongly oppose sending US troops or air support into the conflict.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn sum, we havent had an opportunity to pick up a solid ally like this since S Korea or Poland.

Furthermore the Russians created all these wars by being imperialists as any western power both the Chechens and Mujahideen both.

Bush had assured Gorbachev during the Malta summit in December 1989 that the U.S. would not take advantage (\u201cI have not jumped up and down on the Berlin Wall\u201d) of the revolutions in Eastern Europe to harm Soviet interests; but neither Bush nor Gorbachev at that point (or for that matter, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl) expected so soon the collapse of East Germany or the speed of German unification.[2]\n\nThe first concrete assurances by Western leaders on NATO began on January 31, 1990, when West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher opened the bidding with a major public speech at Tutzing, in Bavaria, on German unification. The U.S. Embassy in Bonn (see Document 1) informed Washington that Genscher made clear \u201cthat the changes in Eastern Europe and the German unification process must not lead to an \u2018impairment of Soviet security interests.\u2019 Therefore, NATO should rule out an \u2018expansion of its territory towards the east, i.e. moving it closer to the Soviet borders.\u2019\u201d The Bonn cable also noted Genscher\u2019s proposal to leave the East German territory out of NATO military structures even in a unified Germany in NATO.[3] \n\nThis latter idea of special status for the GDR territory was codified in the final German unification treaty signed on September 12, 1990, by the Two-Plus-Four foreign ministers (see Document 25). The former idea about \u201ccloser to the Soviet borders\u201d is written down not in treaties but in multiple memoranda of conversation between the Soviets and the highest-level Western interlocutors (Genscher, Kohl, Baker, Gates, Bush, Mitterrand, Thatcher, Major, Woerner, and others) offering assurances throughout 1990 and into 1991 about protecting Soviet security interests and including the USSR in new European security structures. The two issues were related but not the same. Subsequent analysis sometimes conflated the two and argued that the discussion did not involve all of Europe. The documents published below show clearly that it did.\n\nThe \u201cTutzing formula\u201d immediately became the center of a flurry of important diplomatic discussions over the next 10 days in 1990, leading to the crucial February 10, 1990, meeting in Moscow between Kohl and Gorbachev when the West German leader achieved Soviet assent in principle to German unification in NATO, as long as NATO did not expand to the east. The Soviets would need much more time to work with their domestic opinion (and financial aid from the West Germans) before formally signing the deal in September 1990.\n\nThe conversations before Kohl\u2019s assurance involved explicit discussion of NATO expansion, the Central and East European countries, and how to convince the Soviets to accept unification. For example, on February 6, 1990, when Genscher met with British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, the British record showed Genscher saying, \u201cThe Russians must have some assurance that if, for example, the Polish Government left the Warsaw Pact one day, they would not join NATO the next.\u201d (See Document 2)\n\nhttps://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2017-12-12/nato-expansion-what-gorbachev-heard-western-leaders-early",

I'm sure you're also right about Russian perceptions of NATO.  So now, diplomatically it becomes a case of \"do we appease Putin because the Russian people have been deliberately misled in order for the regime to be able to stoke fears about NATO to stay in power?\" or \"do we remain consistent to our own narrative and try to delegitimize Putin and weaken the Russian army and economy until he is ousted or is rendered a non-threat.\"  It seems like EU/NATO nations are still pretty squarely in the second camp.\n\nAlso, I don't know that I would dismiss an official treaty out of hand.  It would help if a treaty existed, and if the treaty had been explicitly extended to Russia post-USSR.  But I think that renegotiating NATO accession and expansion should be on the table in negotiations with Putin.  Like you said, at a minimum it could take away the fig leaf.  Not unlike how it would help eliminate US domestic political antagonism if we either got rid of minimum wage or just pegged it to inflation.  There's be one less thing to argue over, which could lead to progress on other fronts. \n\n  \nThanks, I appreciate the insights!",

The reality is several Democratic nations voluntarily joined a military alliance  with their European neighbors in the hopes of a peaceful future.\n\nRight... but the founding purpose of the military alliance that they joined was containing the USSR. Russia was the largest state within the USSR and inherited the diplomatic status of the USSR after its collapse. Tensions between the US and Russia clearly did not evaporate upon the collapse of the USSR. NATO kept it's gaze and pressure on Russia despite the accomplishment of its original mission. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\n\nIs it really such a stretch to claim that NATO's stance towards Russia has been antagonistic, and that Russia feels that it's national security is threatened by NATO expansion? I think not. \n\n>A particularly hilarious lie is that in 2010 Russia had \"no territorial interests or designs on Ukraine at all\".  I can't imagine anyone believing that.\n\nWhy not? Again, it's really not a stretch to suggest that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2014 had Yanukovych not been ousted in the Maidan revolution. The only incentive Putin/Russia has to invade Ukraine is if it aligns with the West against Russia.\n\n>The speaker in the video goes further with his gaslighting by stating that \"Putin's intention\" when he rolled tanks into Ukraine, a sovereign nation, was to \"force Zelensky to negotiate neutrality\".  How can any reasonable adult believe that was the reason for the invasion?\n\nFrom the Russian perspective, the loss of Ukraine to their old cold-war adversaries would be strategically catastrophic. As long as Ukraine remains at least neutral, Russia has no incentive to invade. This shouldn't be controversial, Russia has repeatedly stated this since as far back as 2008.\n\nOf course, the decision to join the West/NATO is ultimately up to Ukraine. I'm not suggesting that they shouldn't have sovereignty. But I would argue that the US essentially *goaded* Ukraine into distancing itself from Russia and towards a path of NATO membership with false promises of protection thay they could not guarantee. They did this not in Ukraine's interest, but at Ukraine's expense as means to stick a dagger in the side of their old cold-war adversary.\n\nLast, and as a side-note, the fact that you disagree with someone's opinion or interpretation does not necessarily mean that they're \"lying\".",

If that was the point of the video, I would agree with it wholeheartedly.\n\nNeocons like Nuland are definitely the primary instigators and responsible parties of some notable and unjust wars during the last 50 years, but they aren't responsible for the invasion of Ukraine.",

If the fighting stops, the dying stops.\n\nGood numbers are hard to come by but per Zelensky there have been ~13k civilian casualties and ~400k military casualties.  Those military casualties are overwhelmingly from forward units.  Russia is not indiscriminately carpet bombing civilian population centers (though they absolutely could).   \n\nThis thing was over before it began and sadly (though not puzzlingly) Zelensky (and the Biden admin) have previously ignored multiple legitimate off-ramps that would have ended this bullshit.  \n\nThe UK is out of their fucking mind with their recent commitment to putting boots there.  All that this will result in is even more carnage. We should have had nothing to do with this madness in the first place.  \n\nThe west has been trading dollars for dead Ukrainians at about a half a million dollars a pop. Raytheon, Lockheed, General Dynamics, Boeing, and the rest thank you for your service.",

There was no formal treaty.  Thankfully, the incentives were well-aligned, and the statesmen involved were much more honest than today's.\n\nAnd Khrushchev was of course honoring the agreement that he himself had negotiated on behalf of the same country he was still leading.  If Khrushchev had tried to dig up some discussion involving Tsar Nicholas II making some informal promise to a foreign dignitary as a pretext to annex another country, well, there likely would have been war.

The fact that yanukovic was going to be impeached after he fled had nothing to do with nato, it had all to do with Russia and ukriane. He didnt mention what russia did to ukraine to stop them from trading with EU, they might be saying that they want to stop nato, but they want more control then that. To me its odd that its not even mentioned why euromaiden happened, he didnt even say the word. Its literally the only reason there was regime change in the first place.

This is a real cause. \n\nIt is known that many people in the US would love to dismantle Russia into smaller states so that they can have access to the natural resources in Russia. \n\nThe Soviet Union was funded by Wall-Street and wealthy Germans that wanted to mess with the Russian Empire due to its industrial potential. Things just got way too out of hand and these people walked away with that, literally funding genocide. And this all well-documented. \n\nWe have a long history here of Western Forces fighting against Russians. It dates back to centuries. \n\nBut then this is geopolitics, pure statism, what should be the Ancap approach to that?\n\nIt is to reject statism from the West and from the East. Both sides are aggressors. Aggressors against individuals. \n\nThe reality is: Ukraine is just another justification for the western transfer of wealth from the taxpayers to the military industrial complex. \n\nThese people will butcher people for profit. And let\u2019s not think that a lot of people in Russia aren\u2019t also making money from this war. And also a lot of people in China. \n\nThis is nothing but a large scale mafia conflict where the mafias enslave people through conscription and rob their money to fund their wars against other mafias. \n\nBoth sides are wrong and evil. There are no heroes. It\u2019s all propaganda. We will never know all the details of the story, but we have enough to know that all parts involved with the war (the government) are the real aggressors. \n\nBabushkas are being bombed and their offspring will be slaughtered in the name of corporate profit. \n\nIt happened in the Middle East. It seems that the Western powers have become too addicted to the war wealth transfer scheme that they are constantly looking for a new war to justify the robbery.\n\nPropaganda just makes them all sound noble.\n\nBut then, think of the most absurd details: Hunter Biden was there in Ukraine. That\u2019s enough for you to be completely sure that there is pure corruption in this story.\n\nMy heart goes with the individuals that are slaughtered, enslaved and robbed. \n\nI have no sympathy for any mafia. And it\u2019s not like if we are talking about one mafia that\u2019s super bad against the other that\u2019s not too bad. No, the west became completely degenerated and twisted, to a point where there was little preventing it from going full USSR or Camboja. \n\nThe west has abandoned all of its western principles with cheap rhetoric. It\u2019s not like the western elites have any values. They are like Putin. If not worse, if not more twisted and degenerated. The difference between people like Starmer, Kamala, Pedro Sanchez, Olaf, Macron and all other Western leaders is time. They have all worked hard to erode our liberties. It\u2019s just pure hypocrisy.",

It is a geopolitical observation.\n\nI\u2019m a libertarian. I don\u2019t side with states, they\u2019re all mafias. But Russia has always been an enemy of the west and it\u2019s very well documented. \n\nIt\u2019s simply dumb to say everything is Russian propaganda. The west has never trusted Russia and it acted in ways that have proven that so many times. \n\nThey\u2019re historically antagonistic. There was always a sense of distrust when you analyse the Russian and the Western relations throughout the History, much more than a friendly behaviour from the perspective of the leaders of both parts. \n\nThe way you talk of Russia and the West and the way you simply parrot \u2018Russian propaganda\u2019 gives me a hint that you are victimised by the Western propaganda. \n\nBefore \u2018Russian propaganda\u2019 was a trendy term parroted by NPCs, all of these events had happened.\n\nThe Western general historical perspective about Russia was that Russia was backwards and despotic. \n\nThere are writings by several western authors such as diplomats from Britain, describing Russia as some sort of \u2018barbaric land\u2019. (Like Giles Fletcher).\n\nWhat we are seeing is a historical divide that goes back around 1000 years. Russians were always paranoid the Westerners would expand East and Westerners were always paranoid the Russians would expand West. \n\nIn the WWII, Hitler\u2019s betrayal of the Soviet Union was just another display of a culturally western force actually doing that. He had this bizarre idea and goal of expanding East to \u2018save Europeans\u2019, Germans above all, rooted in some kind of Malthusian myth. \n\nBut that\u2019s just another display of the distrust that has always existed between East and West in Europe. \n\nWe cannot paint the West as something \u2018united\u2019, \u2018immaculate\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019. The western world had several periods and there are several countries in it that had diverse ideas and positions throughout the History. \n\nWestern nations even had their disagreements with one another and bloody wars that lasted centuries. But even if you want to calculate, throughout the History, Russia has been more an enemy than it has been an ally of the Western forces. There were critical moments in which Russia and some Western nations made short lived alliances, such as during the Napoleonic wars and WWII. However, in general, they\u2019ve been much more on opposite sides. \n\nSo, my analysis is not some sort of simplification. The alliances of Western nations and Russia were always very fragile, short-lived and opportunistic. They were never cultural or even spiritual. As these two regions have always had a completely different mindset\u2014later heavily influenced by socialism and communism\u2014, that made their already big differences even bigger.",

They were negotiating with Ukraine's opposition and against EU (that's why fuck the EU) to make that happen.\n\nThat's what's Nuland's call about.\n\nIt's absolutely fucking bizarre that for decade, we keep hearing complete opposite.",

            "body": "This is long-established nonsense that has been disproven over the years.\n\nThe facts are these:\n\n1. Ukraine (as a state) has never had a chance to be admitted to nato because: a) a number of requirements for new nato members cannot be fulfilled by Ukraine in the foreseeable future (state of the army, financing, compliance with weapons standards and so on) b) admission to nato is impossible without consensus of all nato members, there has never been any way to reach this consensus with regard to Ukraine.\n\n2. NATO is not an aggressive bloc by definition\n\n3. US military potential is so much greater than that of all other NATO members that when we talk about NATO military potential, we are actually talking about US military power.\n\n4. In reality, the ruling clique of Russia has never been paid any attention to NATO expansion, and is not pay any attention  now (already during the war Finland and Sweden joined NATO, and NATO's approaching St. Petersburg at the distance of a cannon shot did not bother the Russian ruling clique at all).\n\n5. The Russian ruling elite gets all its wealth from the sale of resources and energy mainly to NATO countries, and these countries are not at all interested in taking over the territory containing these resources for the simple reason that the costs of such a step are many orders of magnitude greater than the potential benefits of full control over this vast territory. The Russians are quite successfully extracting these resources for nothing and it would be madness to try to change anything in the status quo.\n\n6. Putin and his clique have long been a part of European politics, acting as a \u2018controlled enemy\u2019 and supplying the polditic market with a \u2018virtual threat\u2019 that is used as an excuse to curtail freedoms (such as the de facto cancellation of elections in Romania) and increase taxation for the benefit of the EU's political top brass.\n\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that no political goals are a justification for the mass murder of people. Murder is murder, and murderers are called murderers regardless of their motives. I remind you that Russia is a state and culture that has been serving as a kind of \u2018provider of mass slaughter\u2019 for European politicians for a very long time. One of the characteristic features of Russia (or rather its ruling circles) is absolute ruthlessness towards its own population, and, as a consequence, absolutely ruthless killing of millions of people in wars of conquest. It is worth paying attention to the history of Russia - it does not get out of wars of conquest and military adventures, because for hundreds of years its ruling top has developed mechanisms of receiving superprofits from continuous conquests (including political benefits), as well as has developed a mechanism of zombieing its own population and maintaining the population in a constantly suitable state for use as cannon fodder.\n\nGiven all of the above, it would be insane to assume that \u2018NATO membership\u2019 is not a cheap propaganda stamp (designed for fools who can't see further than their own noses), but a real, justified reason to kill hundreds of thousands of people. No, we have this war simply because \u2018murderers gonna murder and call themselves as liberators\u2019 is a product of Russia's exports to political markets for hundreds of years.",

Corruption doesn't disappear when a war breaks out.\n\nThat being said, before the 2022 invasion, I think that the US really did intend to help reform Ukraine such that it would be in a position to join NATO in the future even though it wasnt ready at the time. At this point though, I don't think Ukraine will ever join NATO. At least, not while the US is still a member.\n\n2. There are a few examples of NATO acting in ways that can be considered aggressive (Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Libya), and there's no guarantee that won't act aggressively in the future under false pretenses. Nonetheless, even if we grant that NATO will never *initiate* military aggression, Western powers can still act aggressively towards Russia politically and economically.\n\nRussia views NATO expansion as an existential threat because it removes their ability to escalate a conflict or disagreement without military intervention by the US. That is to say, it removes their ability to escalate without their complete and utter destruction. Therefore, they would be forced to submit to Western economic and political domination. And the West, knowing this, would undoubtedly take advantage.\n\nThe war in Ukraine can essentially be understood as Russia exercising their ability to escalate a conflict and impose their will upon Ukraine in the pursuit of strategic concessions before such an ability is lost to them by Western domination of Ukraine. Note that I am *not* arguing that Russia is *justified* in invading Ukraine, that is not my position. I'm simply explaining what I believe to be their rationale.\n\n3. No argument here. \n\n4. People keep using this talking point as if all Russian border countries are of equal strategic importance to Russia. Clearly, this is not the case. Ukraine is of unique strategic importance to Russia, greater than any other former Soviet bloc country (or other border countries such as Finland).\n\n5. One could use a similar argument for why the narrative about Russian conquest of Eastern Europe is pure fantasy.\n\n6. Perhaps there is truth to this, but it doesn't mean that such a relationship was meant to last indefinitely.\n\n>Given all of the above, it would be insane to assume that \u2018NATO membership\u2019 is not a cheap propaganda stamp (designed for fools who can't see further than their own noses), but a real, justified reason to kill hundreds of thousands of people.

Countries require strong incentives to invade others; they must believe that the benefits that they will gain from the invasion (or the existential threat that they will avert) will outweigh the cost and consequences of the invasion, which are always substantial. Murder for the sake of murder is not an incentive.",

I would question if his words are credible. \n\nMainly because it's been made pretty clear that NATO being the issue is a smoke screen by Russia and the fact that they haven't started bombing NATO because of Sweden, Norway, and Finland joining as well as these other states right on their border. But instead it is an oil war, Ukraine found significant natural gas reserves right before the second invasion I intended on selling and undercutting Russia's natural gas to the EU. This would have done serious damage to the Russian economy. Most of what you see in the media is smoke and mirrors. \n\nThen this guy who's talking in the video fails to mention that previous government of Ukraine was not neutral. They were very heavily favoring Russia which points to them as being a puppet government just like Belarus beforehand, which is what led the Ukrainian people to rise up and elect a new government. They also failed to mention that these separatists in the Eastern regions were still the minority, they were a significant minority. But those regions still have voted heavily in favor of their current president. Not to mention the reports of some of those ethnic Russian separatists not even being from those regions and evidence of the separatists being backed by the FSB indicating that before the second invasion Russia likely had special forces on the ground/spetsnaz fueling the separatism. That right there is an act of war. \n\nSo yeah who is this guy and what is his credibility?",

It doesn\u2019t justify it morally, but it explains it practically. Governments are power structures that act to preserve and expand their own influence. They operate on strategic interests, not personal ethics. So from Russia\u2019s perspective, they\u2019re defending or expanding their sphere of control, regardless of whether it\u2019s 'right' in the way we think of individual actions.  They function more like competing corporations or gangs managing turf than people having neighborly disputes. That doesn't excuse it, it just explains the behavior.\n\nThe fact that no one immediately invaded Russia in return shows that even other governments aren't truly shocked by state-level aggression. They know the game. The outrage is mostly for public consumption, behind the scenes, it's strategic math.",
