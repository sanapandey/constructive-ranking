Regional climates (which you are using here), are effected downstream as their current state relies on certain patterns, (rainfall, wind, etc).\n\nAs why I believe it is Humans which are the main drivers of this, it is because no rapid natural change that we have observed so far, has released enough carbon dioxide, methane, etc, to create this graph.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixrka4fstcje1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e10150cb3620ec5f43f2c0cf33c2791df83c6342\n\nAny such natural change would have to be global and would have to emerge from some yet undetected source of greenhouse gasses which is able to outcompete the amount released by industrial emissions.\n\nPointing to the snow on the ground is also not a refutation. Climate change refers generally and to the global set of climates, over a century+ timescale. Weather (the snow or sleet for example) is very temporary. If there was snow in Texas, would I say Texas is a Siberian frontier? No? Then why should a temporary cooling be the reason why climate change doesn't exist.",

Why would \"greenhouse gases\" only affect local areas, as implied by your statement here?\n\nI did imply they were global, and infact I said global in that quote you used. Any such natural change would HAVE TO BE global if they were to account for the climate being changed. If it is not Humans, then what is it?\n\nYou're putting the term greenhouse gasses in quotes, why is that? Is it because they are not real or is it because you believe that these gasses do not come from Humans, and if so, where do they come from going back to my question from earlier.\n\n>Why do you trust that graph?\n\nWhy wouldn't I? All the graphs I have found so far have agreed with it in some capacity. I haven't found any credible graphs which disagree with it handily. These are temperature graphs. I am fine with the idea that these changes are regular and that we are not the main causers of it, but there is no disputing that there is a climate change of sorts happening, and the evidence saying that we are not the main causers, or that this is just a warm period, don't account for how fast the temperature is seemingly rising over time.\n\n\\* [*https://climate.geologist-1011.net/*](https://climate.geologist-1011.net/) *(the place you got that article from) does state that the main cause of Human-caused climate change would be from deforestation and not carbon dioxide. It has me somewhat more convinced, but it has not convinced me that Humans aren't the main drivers of it.*",
