Turn voters into shareholders. In expevolu the shares are called cb. \n\nExpevolu comes from experience. So no more too much heory what ancapnistan or pure libertaeian country should do. Just try see if it works. Then let the best system to bring peace and prosperity grow. \n\nVolu comes from voluntary. \n\nWe do not consider interaction with government as voluntary for good reasons. Governments and voters do not own the country and the voters interests are not the same with owners interests. \n\nIf voters become more like shareholders then interaction with government will be more voluntary. For example why should we pay taxes to get oppressed more? But if rulers or voters are like owners they have incentive to make tax payers happy so more economically productive people can come. \n\nBasically turn voters into shareholders. \n\nShareholders allow entrepreneurs to create mini countries and share profit with citizens. \n\nWhat's best is based on experience or reality. System evolved. And the process is voluntary. \n\nSo not too much reasoning of what things should be. Just give it a try see which one gives more return to shareholders. \n\nBasically prospera with an army of voters. \n\nMy idea is simpler though. \n\nTurn citizens into shareholders",
