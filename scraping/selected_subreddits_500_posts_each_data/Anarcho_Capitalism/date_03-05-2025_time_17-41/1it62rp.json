So it's easy to assume that any kind of military support or action falls under the same category.\n\nHere, a country was straightforwardly invaded by an imperialistic authoritarian power with casus belli being orders of magnitude more absurd fabricated pretenses. If there was any way it could be stopped without military support, I'd support it - but for now, we just don't have anything better. Giving a fraction of a percent of our capabilities to a force defending against aggression until the invader is worn out is just the best course of action.\n\nI still hope that the rhetoric we're seeing is poking western europeans into not relying on US defense umbrella, which would be a good thing. But I'm afraid that we might be heading for a Chamberlain scenario, and if that's the case, we'll wake up in a world that's definitely less free someday, and the cost to pay would be more than the 0.3% of GDP that USA contributes, or 0.6% GDP that my country contributes.",

Just reminding that US has poured ~40x more inflation-adjusted funds into unneeded dumb wars with boots on the ground this century (in both of which Poland participated though it was not its business at all, but article 5 was invoked so we obliged). And now, when actually some of that could help a mutually beneficial cause of crippling the invader economically, we pretend that it's not our business anymore. Not a good precedent.",

No other country in the world has moved away from authoritarianism as effective as Ukraine in the last 11 years. \n\nThe legitimate government of the Ukraine was overthrown by the US in 2014. Since then they've had a dictator that eliminated opposition media, killed journalists, banned free speech, cancelled elections, and now has a dictator for the duration of an endless war. It's, by definition, a dictatorship.\n\n>2013 revolution in Ukraine had overwhelming popular support and would have succeeded regardless of any US interference\n\nThere's zero evidence of that, particularly given the US interfered to obtain that outcome. We shouldn't meddle in the politics of other countries.\n\n>We had to effectively blackmail Clinton into accepting Poland into NATO by threatening to publicly campaign for republicans among polish diaspora in the 90s.\n\nThen I guess we need to kick Poland out of NATO.\n\n>Western European countries are. \n\nAnd why should we be allies with tyrants? \n\n>Just reminding that US has poured ~40x more inflation-adjusted funds into unneeded dumb wars with boots on the ground this century (in both of which Poland participated though it was not its business at all, but article 5 was invoked so we obliged). \n\nAnd those wars were mistakes. We learned lessons there.\n\n>And now, when actually some of that could help a mutually beneficial cause of crippling the invader economically, we pretend that it's not our business anymore.\n\nInvader of what? A dictatorship we have no obligation to? To destabilize a major world power that could kill me and my entire family? All so Europeans can continue to enjoy lavish public benefits while my country goes bankrupt?\n\nAfter the last eight years or so fuck Europe. Fuck their hatred of us. Fuck their interference in our politics. Fuck their smarmy little tyrants that oppress their people while threatening ours. At this point I hope I get to see Russian tanks rolling into Berlin again.",

The key thing about these \u201crevolutions\u201d is that they are heavily funded and supported by foreign governments or NGOs, such as George Soros\u2019 groups. Rather than directly or covertly overthrow an existing regime, these organizations operate \u201cabove board,\u201d meaning they avoid specifically endorsing candidates\u2014since that would be illegal\u2014and instead fund and assist groups that promote more generic, non-partisan efforts like \u201cdemocracy.\u201d In context, of course, their activities are geared to \u201cbenefit . . . a favored candidate or party.\u201d A favorite tactic is using \u201cparallel vote tabulation\u201d or exit polls, which are used to dispute official election results. The dispute typically spills over into street demonstrations with the goal of ousting the ostensible victor.\n\nThe \u201crevolutions\u201d began in Serbia in 2000 with the ousting of Clinton\u2019s b\u00eate noire Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. As Horton sardonically comments, this culminated in the \u201csacking and burning of the [Serbian] parliament building in what would surely be called a violent insurrection by American Democrats if they had not been behind it.\u201d Numerous other states would be targeted for color revolutions by the US and its Soros-backed NGO allies over the next decades.\n\nIncredibly, this only begins to scratch the surface of these early, post-Cold War provocations toward Russia that Horton documents, let alone the follies and misdeeds that occurred during the George W. Bush presidency and thereafter. Horton has persuasively made the case that the US provoked Russia over the course of three decades, knowing that Russia would respond with hostility toward NATO expansion. Yet, with reckless abandon, US leaders and officials pushed on, achieving their wildest dreams of NATO expansion and setting their sights on what was always their crown jewel\u2014Ukraine. It did not have to be this way, and it still does not. But time is ticking. Defying expectations, President Biden manages to reach new heights of absurdity in his escalatory policy toward Russia, ticking off a box on Zelensky\u2019s deadly five-point \u201cpeace\u201d plan. The war cannot end soon enough.",
