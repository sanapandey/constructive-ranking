            "body": "Why does the same story keep playing over and over again? The US Telecom industry just got hacked less than a year ago because of \"legal backdoors\" like this.  \n  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Typhoon  \n  \n> In late 2024 U.S. officials announced that hackers affiliated with Salt Typhoon had accessed the computer systems of nine U.S. telecommunications companies, later acknowledged to include Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Spectrum, Lumen, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream.[8][9][10] The attack targeted U.S. broadband networks, particularly core network components, including routers manufactured by Cisco, which route large portions of the Internet.[3][4] In October 2024, U.S. officials revealed that the group had compromised internet service provider (ISP) systems used to fulfill CALEA requests used by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to conduct court-authorized wiretapping.[9]  \n  \nIn the process of writing this I am even more engaged. Because I wanted to provide a quote, so I googled the incident by searching \"US Telecom hack,\" because it was recent news, and significant news at that. But do you know what I found? Not a single 1 of the 10 articles on  the first page of Google results mentioned the information I quoted above, which is in the first paragraph on Wikipedia. The *way that the hacked information was obtained* was by infiltrating the legal intercept system. This system was incorporated directly into the 3G spec at the request of governments like the US. Only 1 article of the 10 articles I read even mentioned that CALEA was affected, and that article conveniently worded it to imply that CALEA was just one *kind* of information that was affected, instead of being the actual source of the golden pot of data the hackers were looking for. And it completely left out that CALEA was accessed by *using the backdoor* that only \"law enforcement\" was supposed to use.  \n  \nHistory is repeating itself again in the UK, and also with Signal and Telegram. Governments keep demanding intentional backdoors. Intentional backdoors are decried by the entire cybersecurity industry, because hacks like this keep happening, and they will continue to happen. If governments actually cared about \"protecting their people,\" then they would reject this crap.",

CALEA, in contrast, does not require providers to decrypt data for which they hold no key.\n\nDefinitely not defending any govt surveillance program (except when to do so would catch or stop actual criminals), but the UK is completely unhinged and we haven't reached that level yet in US (not that I *know* of at least)",
