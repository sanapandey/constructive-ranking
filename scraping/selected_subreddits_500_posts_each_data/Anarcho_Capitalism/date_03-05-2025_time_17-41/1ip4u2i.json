Is it possible that Trump is a 4D Chess master who secretly loves Free Trade and wants zero trade barriers? Maybe. But everything I've observed about Trump suggests the opposite. His steel tariff in his first term especially was damaging to our economy, and we got pretty much nothing out of it. The simpler explanation is that Trump genuinely thinks that tariffs are good. The fact that he also uses them as a threat isn't that much of a consolation to me.",

That part I found interesting because Millei wants to do a true free trade deal, which if Trump means it would allow that type of agreement. \n\nGoing off what he says, the current steel and aluminum blanket tariffs are because countries are using Canada and Mexico as passthroughs to dump subsidized raw materials here. If true I would agree with the approach until trade negotiations patch the weakness.",

But that's not economically correct. If another country is subsidizing their crap, that doesn't hurt you. It hurts their people, but not yours - because they are using *their* taxes to do it. If China sent us steel for free, how would that hurt us? If China sent us steel at a discount (paid for by Chinese taxes or Chinese law), how would that hurt us? We're getting cheap steel either way. That's good for our economy. Does it lower the price of steel here? Yup. Is that a bad thing? It depends: do you have a vested financial interest  in the price of steel? If you a tiny steel producer in the US, then yeah, lower steel prices is bad for you. That steel producer is now willing to spend millions of dollars lobbying politicians. But that steel producer is acting in their own interests, not in the interests of the American people. Americans buy steel. They buy products made with steel. Lower steel prices is a good thing.  \n  \nThe fact that Trump acts and talks this way means either: he doesn't understand basic economics; or, he is talking out his butt for political reasons (either to win the support of a special interest group, or to fire up his economically illiterate voter base); or a combination of both.",
