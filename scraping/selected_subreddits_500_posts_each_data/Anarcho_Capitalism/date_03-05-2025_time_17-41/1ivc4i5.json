            "body": "I like Henry George. \n\nInstead of government selling land, government should just rent land and that's equivalent of land taxes. \n\nLand tax simply change the way people buy land. Normally we buy land from government and government has perpetual obligation to honor those land and we have no obligation. I think it's more stable to just rent land from government and that is what land taxes is. For the same reason you don't buy slaves, you hire them peace by peace. For the same reason you don't marry women. You hire them one month at a time\n\nYou also don't sign contract with KFC and let KFC supply fried chicken for you for life. You pay for chicken when you want chicken.\n\nFull georgism is problematic. But he has the right idea\n\nProblem with georgism\n\nWhat about if you want to build skyscraper? Here buying the land or paying it for 100 years make sense. \n\nWhat about miners? Someone figure out a land have good buy land and mine gold. If he can't buy the land such opportunities are wasted. \n\nWhat about cradle to grave welfare recipients? They now have more UBI. I think the fact that welfare recipients got UBI should motivate voters to make being cradle to grave welfare recipients difficult. \n\nBut overall land taxes make more sense than income taxes.",
