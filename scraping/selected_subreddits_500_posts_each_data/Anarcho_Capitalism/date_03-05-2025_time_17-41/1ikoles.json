Central planning usually doesn't work even when it's done out in the open, so arguments that central planning is working effectively when being conducted under a veil of secrecy carry a heavy burden of proof.\n\nThe end result of patterns of dysfunctional intervention may well be market distortions that create these outcomes, and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter whether those outcomes were anyone's intention or not, since we still have the same problems to solve either way.  But we're better off not engaging in speculative scapegoating -- well-intentioned errors are usually *more* destructive than intentional malfeasance, and solving problems is more effective when you treat them as mistakes to be corrected rather than fights to be won.",

In fact, copyright is also relied upon by FOSS licenses to create software distribution models that are drastically different to commercial software -- in a world without copyright, we might not need them, but FOSS represents a model by which individuals have collaboratively leveraged government interventions to work around the very problem that those interventions have created.  You could even cite that as a successful example of agorism in action.  \n\nThere are a lot of problems caused by government intervention, but it's important not to falsely attribute problems to government that it *didn't* create.  If we do that, then statists will latch on to that to \"prove\" that we don't know what we're talking about, and we won't be able to make our case for the 95% of things we're pointing out that government *is* responsible for.",
