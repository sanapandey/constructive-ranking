I've heard a lot of theories, especially a theory that Trump would lie if it *was* empty.. there's a lot of speculation that it's either empty or close to it.\n\nWhat would happen economically if it was revealed to be empty? What would happen to the dollar, to the country, or the geopolitical world?\n\nThere's no way they'd say it's empty no matter what?",

It has just been one of those things for that they've kept secret for decades, and for basically no justifiable reason.  \n  \nKeep in mind that the US didn't just end up in this fiat currency standard where the money means nothing overnight. The currency used to be backed by gold, then they changed the exchange rates, then they set up a convoluted standard for exchanging it with gold, then they went off the gold standard altogether.  \n  \nIf they had gone off gold overnight, it would have been transparently evil/unwise to everyone. So at the time, Fort Knox was a, \"Trust us. You don't have to worry about the currency being meaningless. You don't have to worry about the government going back of the currency. You didn't have to worry about the government defaulting on payments. Look! We've got a healthy reserve of gold right here in Fort Knox!\"  \n  \nBut then Fort Knox went silent, and critics tried to call D.C. on their B.S.  \n  \n\"Hey. What ever happened to *all of that gold* that you told us was totally going to help keep the currency safe in a pickle?\" And Washington would just stonewall and gaslight about it. It was obvious to everyone what was actually happening, but the government just saved face, dug in their heels, and refused to admit anything for decades. Ron Paul wasn't the only critic back in the day. So the game they played (early on in the policy, when public opinion actually mattered) made a real difference in giving the state apologists something to fend off the critics.  \n  \n\"Oh yeah. These nutjobs are *so worried* that or correct is going to collapse, and they say Fort Knox is empty! But *The Experts* tell us that the good is still there, just like the government says it is.\"  \n  \nAnd five minutes later, the narrative turned to, \"Why are you guys so worried? The government says there isn't a problem. And yeah, they won't let you *verify* that the gold is there, but that's okay, because *The Experts* tell us that we don't need that gold anyway.\"  \n  \nAnd years later, the narrative shifted again. \"What? Gold? Why would we need that? We went off the gold standard decades ago, and *The Experts* say that's a good thing...\"  \n  \nEvery step of the way, the educated people knew it was B.S., but the politicians got away with it. Because the normal people only pay attention to the temperature of the slowly boiling water (like the good frogs D.C. hope for).  \n  \nSo why audit now? Mostly for a puric victory. If we are in the process of ripping out all of the other garbage, we might as well rip this curtain off, too. It's showing that the emperor has no clothes, never did, and lied about it to everyone. And they called everyone *else* crazy or crack pot alarmists/conspiracy theorists for pointing out the obvious.",

The idea that dollars are \"magic money\" and it works just because is false, even if it is true. Let me explain.\n\nGold is real money. If people know you have piles and piles of it, they'll accept your fake money, as they know there's some real money behind it. Well, perhaps you have silver. That will do as well. Perhaps you have lots of oil. Less good, but sure. Alright, then perhaps you have a country with millions of people, industries, a few hundred companies that pay enough tax that it matters... Alright. But at each step, it gets worse, less trustworthy. You need the foundation of the gold, the real money.\n\nIf you're an investor with billions of dollars, you have a sense that in 100 years, you may have lost 90% of it, and that's a possibility in your mind. If you have dollars, and the US has a gigantic pile of real money (gold), your worst possible outcome is the American financial system fails, but at least the authority behind that still has the real money, so the situation might be salvageable.\n\nIf you're down to promises that your industry is useful, even if it seems like China's is much superior, that your populace is capable of producing lots of wealth, even if they're fat and the best ones aren't even patriotic and could be bought off at any moment, that you produce lots of oil, and it's not even clear for how long that will remain the basis of human production... Then you're really down to nothing. China can build an Americatown, invite every hundred-millionaire and above American to live there and do whatever they want without having to pay American taxes, and it's over, the United States is down to hundreds of millions of people who aren't really capable of even maintaining a modern country at the level they got \"accustomed\" to. A future gigantic Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, just another shit hole whose currency no one would trust for even a second.\n\nIf there's no gold in Fort Knox, the US might make it to the other side if a dozen Elon Musks decide to rebuild the country and are given full authority to do it, after shredding the Constitution. Most likely, some would move to Dubai, others to China, and the US would be over.",
