And it will likely be so for a long time.\n\nBut statists and libertarians alike are prone to seeing markets as a completely fixed, known quantity...as if we've seen the end of history in both how reasonable governments can get (i.e. Fukuyamian western liberalism), and in how robust and advanced markets can be.\n\nWe've barely gotten started...and markets have way better feedback and self-corrective mechanisms than political/governmental systems.  \n\nWe've spent over 5000 years pouring all of our blood, sweat, and treasure into making governments work, and we're certainly at diminishing returns.\n\nWe've barely scratched the surface on active employment of and combinations of market mechanisms towards governance and coordination and wealth production via unhampered markets.  \nJust one tiny example- lotteries are traditionally restricted or monopolized by the state for a reason: this is one of many important mechanisms to be combined with others, to voluntarily produce public goods (i.e. it alleviates the assurance problems, thus less free-riding).\n\nBut efficacy of holding a Mega-Millions lottery (to pay for and coordinate military deterrence of outside invasion) aside; it is true that there's a potential catch-22: where a stateless region can never avoid invasion long enough to develop robust markets to provide enough wealth and coordination to mount a real set of non-colluding defensive forces...but nevertheless, these things do co-evolve.  \n\nIt doesn't take one giant stroke of luck for this to emerge in one go. It can emerge in small steps; like nation-states themselves becoming more tolerant and supportive of charter cities and special economic zones and partial protection of autonomous zones; until such time as both the capability has developed on the proto-anarchic side, and the aggression has diminished a bit on the statist side.",

We can avoid them, but avoiding them completely is way harder and more costly than most are willing to pay.\n\nThe majority don't even realize they are being enslaved and robbed.\n\nNow, if the question were \"why aren't there large territories free from those large criminal organizations?\"\n\nI would say that is because we didnt educate enough people into how to fight them.\n\nBeing the ruling criminal in a region is too profitable. We need the \"resistance\" to be more costly to them than what they gain from it.\n\nFor the obvious alternative (and not the only one)... We would need a private military force large enough to face a state's military. So we need that the money people are voluntarily willing to pay that military to compare to how much a government puts into it.\n\nI was pretty excited when some Blackwater guy talked about a crowdfunding to kill Maduro in Venezuela. Don't know what came from it... \n\nBut we will eventualy have things like that happening... From defeating A government to defeat ANY wannabe government in a region is just one extra step\n\nBut again, we would need enough people willing to pay enough money to some military force to protect a region from all others...\n\nWhile at the same time, the cost/benefit of them getting that voluntary money should be greater than if they instead took it by force (becoming themselves the government)\n\nSo we need A LOT of people valuing freedom (to pay for it) and we also need people able to fight for it themselves to some extent (so, if the private military wants to take over, it knows it will cost them, in blood and money...)\n\nWe dont have it currently. Im not sure we will ever have.\n\nWhy would I hire a military to fight for freedom if I could hire it to fight to impose what i believe over others?\n\nWhy would I pay a lot of money for something i can't see the value (in the sense that if I pay or if I dont pay, things dont chage... they would only change if a lot of people didnt pay)\n\nPeople usualy prefer to join forces with like minded authoritarians to stablish their \"muslin/comunist/whatever state\"\n\nBut, we have MORE people defending freedom and trying to defend themselves from governments than ever. Or, if not ever, in a while. And growing...\n\nTechnology, the internet and BTC are a game changer that is in its infancy still...\n\nIts harder than ever for them to control information and money. Even guns, with 3d printers, will be easier to access even if they try to deny you your self defence right.\n\nMilei got Ancap ideias to be taken somewhat seriously, finally. Trump praising him also pushes it to a whole new level. If not ancap, some \"extremist\" libertarian ideas most people would laugh at a few decades ago, now will have proven they work and improve societies.\n\nCrypto is more common each day.\n\nMore and more people learn how to protect themselves in the internet.\n\nWe are far from an ancap world, but getting closer.\n\nPS: a private city/state/country isnt a perfect solution in the models we have. Its just a different way of being robbed. The cities still have to pay the criminals to be left alone, and have few safeguards in case the criminals decide they want to go back to robbing them trough violence again.",

Government just lie saying prospera is bad because they don't want people to know prospera is good. \n\nInstead prospera should share shares or profit to Honduras voters. \n\nGive each eligible voters in prospera a share in prospera for example. Small amount but with clear incentives. We prosper you get a bit of cash. Doesn't have to be huge. Just clear and automated. \n\nThen I bet my ass voters in Honduras will vote for more and more zede. \n\nhttps://expevolu.substack.com/\n\nAlso prospera is not ancap\n\nIt's a private cities. \n\nI believe network of private cities are effectively ancap and turning voters into shareholders is a quick way to accomplish that.",

In reality, people, including many libertarians, are still far too violent and hate their fellow man far too much. That's not to say they don't help people out sometimes for the good of the other person\u2014they do\u2014but truly achieving something like this requires a love, including for one's enemies, more radical than being occasionally helpful. And, this love has to be of a sufficient extent and understanding so as to be willing to destroy the state and seek the good for all people voluntarily, not outsourcing charity to the state or worshipping the idol that is the nation (or whatever new god is trendy). After all, consider how many Christians, who are supposed to *agape* people, still support sending armed thugs with guns to blow up random countries across the globe. The ideology of society will have to change in a manner similar to the Protestant Reformation before we see this happen to a significant degree. The question then becomes how to trigger such a thing. Perhaps all it requires is concentrating enough anarchists in some political entity so that they can take the reins of power before destroying it. New Hampshire and Argentina may be examples of this.\n\nFundamentally my thesis is basically that the character of a person and the functioning of their mind necessarily precedes the implementation of abstract ideas. Ideas don't act upon the world *per se.*",

                            "body": "Understandable and good question. The way Christianity defines love is different from how most people conceive of it. Instead of an emotion, *agape* love, which a Greco-Christian word, refers to unselfishly seeking the good for other people. This is how the AMP Bible defines it in the footnote for Matthew 5:44:\n\n>\"The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word *agape*) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another.\"\n\nand\n\n>\"that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for\"\n\nSo, when you use the least amount of force possible to stop an aggressor and care about their rights despite their unjust actions, you're reflecting this type of love for them. You still show you care about your fellow man despite the wrong they've done, even if you're angry at them. Of course, the next step that you don't get from Anarchism alone is actually doing positive good to them rather than just restraining yourself from doing evil, see 1 Thessalonians 5:15 and Romans 12:20-21. It's this aspect of seeking the good of other people who you're not obligated to care about that ends up creating a more positive society on the whole because the people within it will treat each other better.",

            "body": "I can say 2 things here, short answer is that simply, we live in reality. The reason why we have no ancap societies today is because of history, history happened and is never changing. The longere answer is that the ideology of anarcho-capitalism is very rare. While it is correct on all fronts, it is very contradictory to the current ideologies of communism and liberalism, which is what most people in the modern day have assumed as their positions, and they assumed those positions because the institutions around them say that those positions are the correct ones and that everything else is either subversion, a danger to democracy, bigoted, capitalistic, etc.\n\nTherefore, there is virtually no chance in the modern day that we will see an ancap society. Prospera as another comment noted is the closest but is still not the ideal. Currently, there is no chance. The society is opposed to it and the institutions are also opposed to it. So are the intellectuals to add a cherry on top.\n\nMy flair on this subreddit is \"Anarcho-Space-Capitalist\" Why would I bring this up? Simply because space is massive. The distances are so big and so empty that there is no real chance that we ever see a centralized society like in most sci-fi stories. Because of the virtual size limit of states, that being resource expenditure increasing at a way higher rate per extra territory, and thus making large states impractical in addition to the threat of separatism growing at an exponential rate essentially the larger a state is, we would see lots of smaller nations, 100s even in individual star systems. If we ever get the technology to, we could also have those nations in the space between worlds as well. Thus I would say that Anarcho-capitalism is kind of inevitable due to great distances in space destroying large states, only allowing for small city states to be sporadically doted. Free markets would essentially set the rules in that future. \n\nThat however is for the far future. Today, an ancap society has no chance of emerging as there are too many forces against it. Until Prospera becomes a free country or Milei destroys Argentina as a state, we will most certainly never see an ancap society in the next 20 - 40 years.",

There will be the threat of state intrusion until enough people become aware the don't really need the state and are willing to fight for their freedom, which may never happen, but those of us that care enough can have it right now to whatever extent we are willing to fight for it and take risks. Most people do not want to take responsibility and risks, they would rather have an inferior life with consistency than a superior life with some bumps and challenges.
