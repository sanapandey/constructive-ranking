    "selftext": "Like eight years ago, I had done lots of work, research and such that was part of writing a book. I overwrote what was written and abandoned it rather than fix it. Things aligned in such a way that I am rewriting that project. I am still not done, but I am making serious progress and if there is interest or social pressure, these things help me finish as soon as practical. Only read more if you are curious or interested.\n\nThe summary of the idea is that on an unmentioned alien planet, with realistic, alternative technology to ours, no computers,  no engines, little metal work because of the danger and unpredictable nature of fire there. There is a socialist kingdom that \u201cborders\u201d in their idea a group of contract bound merchants. We know that these people are ancaps, but it isn\u2019t really known to the socialist kingdom. Anyway, largely because of what they view as a \u201cmerchant\u201d \u201ckingdom\u201d not paying their taxes, they go to war. Because of their kingdom\u2019s laws, the first born prince must go to combat in a lawful war to keep is spot in the throne line. This prince is killed. The second born princess decides not to go to war. She loses her spot in the throne inheritance. The third born child, a princess decides to go to war to retain her family\u2019s rule over this kingdom. This people have alternatives to our tech. Modernized versions of our abandoned or alternative devices. They use magazine fed semi-automatic and automatic crossbows in battle, and they travel on boats that sail, cars that sail, trains that sail, and sailplanes or gliders that don\u2019t sail, but glide. They are launched by winches that are powered by windmills. Anyway, that\u2019s the setting. More to it. Maybe it will be good this try. We\u2019ll see. ",

That\u2019s a good question, I think I should see a donation profile or something that way people can read if they desire and pay later if able.",
