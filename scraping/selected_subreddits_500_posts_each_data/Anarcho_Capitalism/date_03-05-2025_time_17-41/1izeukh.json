You will not see them EVER say \"Well at least this guy isn't Donald Trump.\" Their opponent needs to be the most vile human ever. When your ideas hold no water, all you can do is play to emotion. \n\nWhen Vance runs in 2028 (or whoever else) I promise that he will be worse than Trump. \n\nUnless DOGE actually shuts down a majority of the federal government I won't be voting anyways",
