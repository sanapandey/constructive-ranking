Wanting a system that treats billionaires and the homeless the same, aka *equality before the law*, isn't socialist. I firmly believe that's what *most* people think. Now the younger generation, those who started school in the 2000s, were indoctrinated into a corrupted understanding which tries to erase the distinction between equality and equity. They aren't able to articulate the difference between those two or freedom from vs freedom to. It's blaming the victim of brainwashing to say they're socialists because of that when they *think* they're loyal to freedom.\n\n>The average citizen wants government to spend on them.\n\nI don't believe that's true. I believe it's more \"*If you're going to waste money anyways, you might as well waste the money on things I care about.*\" That's a resignation of being unable to do fundamental change and falling back to just trying to redirect the system away from what you disagree with.

They voted for him because they hoped he'd be a wrecking ball to the status quo.",

OP's post was the only thing that was disingenuous, not Rand Paul's statement which was clearly an appeal to cut spending, not an endorsement of the Republican parties history of fiscal policy making (a lot of which Rand Paul has called out in the past btw). We should be supporting Rand here and encouraging this, but instead were throwing shade at one of the few voices that are legitimately calling for real spending cuts.",

The size of the bill represents the biggest ever proposed and it includes another round of direct cash payments to Americans, extends unemployment benefits to the end of January, and adds hazard pay for front-line workers. It also expands virus-testing efforts, contact tracing and treatment.\n\n>\"This is a very strategically planned piece of legislation that is tailored strictly to meet the needs of the American people regarding the coronavirus pandemic,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on the House floor ahead of the vote. \"To do anything less would not be responsible.\"\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/house-vote-coronavirus-relief-package-33f4902ca9a2aed4e76274af6bb2ea5c](https://apnews.com/article/house-vote-coronavirus-relief-package-33f4902ca9a2aed4e76274af6bb2ea5c)\n\n>The House gave final congressional approval to the sweeping package by a near party line 220-211 vote precisely seven weeks after Biden entered the White House and four days after the Senate passed the bill. Republicans in both chambers opposed the legislation unanimously, characterizing it as bloated, crammed with liberal policies and heedless of signs the crises are easing.\n\nLet's not pretend the democratic caucus was not flinging ridiculously large relief packages through congress on party line votes during Covid. GOP has a problem of cutting taxes while not reducing the spending with it and the Dems have a problem of raising taxes but increasing spending by magnitudes more than the tax offset.",

I am not in the position to know how doable it is that so much waste exists (but probably), that is can be tracked down effectively to a large degree (tough task), that Trump/Musk won't get blocked in some way (you know they'll try very hard to do that), and that Trump will really go through with it at least to a large degree (he may leave behind some republican darlings but wouldn't it be nice if the next dem pres cut those too as a revenge cutting, hehe).",

And the current interim budget was haggled out under Biden at the end of 2024 and is similar to the 2024 deficit but only IF it isn't changed much in the current haggling and only IF DOGE and Trump do not slash a lot before the end of the year.   The republicans are still working on a new one.  \n\nDOGE has been around since Obama but with a diff name.  ALso DOGE budget was cut by about 70% under Trump so it's actually a cut expense, not an addition.  Also if DOGE is cutting 1 billion a day as they claim, or anything close, the it paid for it's current annual budget of 14.4 million a year on the first day.  It would be imbecilic to not fund an agency that pays for itself on the first day, calling DOGE a 'spending' is lunacy.  \n\nI also said 'most' of his spending was tax cuts, not all.  OBviously he has his pet projects but most of those of those are not taking a lot of money compared to what he is cutting.  ANd the few more expensive ones have not passed the house and senate so they are not for sure.  In negotiation, you come out with lofty demands knowing they will often get pared down.   \n\nAnyway, the proof is in the pudding and Trump has only been in for 2 minutes, complaining about him not having yet fixed 20 years or deficit spending in 2 months when no other president or regime has done jack shxt about it all this time is ridiculous.   DOGE has claimed they've found absolutely massive amounts of weird shxt, even trillions in untraceable payments.  IF even 20 percent of that is legit, we should make progress.

It's also not a DEFICIT or a total budget number, the projected deficit for this year, as calculated by the budget hacked out during the end of Biden's term is 1.9 trillion as I said and last I checked, they were still haggling over if they would cut that lower or what . So your statement that there is a proposed deficit of  4.5 trillion is completely in error, nowhere says that, even your link says it's a 10 year tax cut, it is not the total budget deficit.  Trump wants that tax extension but he also wants them to make other cuts to counterbalance it but even if they don't, it won't be anywhere near 4.5 trillion.  Please read more carefully next time so you don't spread disinformation.  \n\nAnd DOGE saves more money then it spends, call it whatever you want, it's net savings and a very good thing,  You acting like DOGE is bad thing because it is 'spending' is disengenuous as is you acting like Trump inacted it when it was actually already there or you acting like it got more money when in fact it's current budget is actually much lower than before so it is a cut in costs, not an addition. You can't stop spinning this and moving the goal posts and it just makes you more and more untrustworthy. \n\nFor DOGE receipts, you asked if there were ANY receipts and yes there they are, no one said they are all up there yet and you are moving the goal posts really hard with that demand. Maybe give the guy a few weeks? He's done about a thousand times more to cut than anyone else on this and in record time, sorry if you don't get to see all the receipts in 10 minutes, they need to  go through and analyze each program before they decide on specific cuts and once they do that, they put up the total savings after final decisions are made on each program instead of just giving out ballpark figures, you are not going to get everything placed up there in 10 seconds, they are constantly working on it and nowhere near finished.  \n\nAs for your final link, it doesn't load for me so IDK what you are talking about on that. But look bro, it's clear your bias is so heavy that you just want very very badly to find something to hate about Musk and Trump's investigation and every time you claim something, you are proven wrong, and then you nitpick on some tiny definition issue that is completely meaningless to the overall picture, move the goal posts really hard, or jump to another equally poorly researched and wrong theory that you then still, using zero accurate evidence, assert is true.  \n\nI don't have all day to endlessly debunk your stuff but maybe think about researching your claims a bit first next time before trying to claim something that is so easily proven untrue.   And maybe learn some basic definitions like the meaning of 'budget deficit' so you can understand articles better.  But from my end, I'm done playing this game, it's up to you to decide if you care more about truth than your addiction to hating. You don't seem interesting in actually accurately reading what I wrote or accurately responding with truthful comments, you just want to spill hate at some people you already decided to hate no matter what, so I am blocking you, bye bye!",
