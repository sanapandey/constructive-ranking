Per my understanding she implied it\u2019s the \u201cart of the deal\u201d to not show the card yadda yadda.\n\nI believe a govt stilled cannot be trusted, unless power is striped etc.\n\nBut putting that aside, the interesting question for me is, what is the libertarian point of view in this situation?\n\nAs in:\n- the state is still getting involved with foreign states and exercising its power\n- however (assuming) not using tax money or troops\n\nMy personal opinion is it\u2019s fine assuming the govt doesn\u2019t spend money or send troop.",

Trump may call this the \"art of the deal\", but if you met it on the street, you'd call it a mugging.\n\n\"I didn't *shoot* that person who willingly gave me his wallet. I just showed him my gun and whispered a little something something in his ear. See, it was non violent!\"\n\nIt is comforting to know Trumps team is claiming this is just \"art of the deal\". That makes it less objectionable. But I'd still say it's objectionable.",
