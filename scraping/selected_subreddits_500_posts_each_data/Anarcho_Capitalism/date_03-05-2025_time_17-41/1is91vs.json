I dont know how the media landscape looks like in the US, but here in Europe there is a war and USA is not taking the leadership(without any EU approval) in negotiations with Russia. Personally I wouldnt even called that a negotiations, and im deeply worried about trumps position in this war, to be frank he seems to take putins position in the war more so than helping Ukraine. Im worried that this sets presedence for a new world order where expansionism and aggressive territorial disputes will be the future, not only from Russia but also from USA and China. In terms of USA involvement in this I cant really blame anybody else than trump for facilitating this, he is giving putin all the cards to play. I know most of u guys care about economics, but trump fronts the foreign policy of USA so that also need to be discussed, not just domestic policy and DOGE etc.",

If you are in the surrounding countries, you are potentially under threat. If you are the EU, you are also potentially under threat since the current Ukraine regime is allied with them.\n\nIf you are in Ukraine or EU and you don't like the current ruling regimes, Russia might not be a threat. The anti EU parties don't want to fund the war.\n\nIf you are in the US, I don't see how Russia is a threat even if it conquer the entire continent. Invading the US is close to impossible.",

They said so in 2013, ukraine cannot choose sides between EU and Russia, if they do they will divide the country. Meanwhile the majority wants an EU relationship. So russia decided to fk with ukraine trade. Why do you think they needed help from CIA to hate the Russians when ukraine people already hated them before because of a very aggressive trade embargo. If Russia had allowed them to choose who they wish to trade with, there wouldnt be any Euromaiden protest. If yanukovic hadnts buckled under pressure from russia, against the people will, people wouldnt protest. Thats russia state interference in a ukraine trade relations, why is that acceptable.\n\nAnd yanukovic fled the country, you cant be president when you flee to your ally. So he got removed from his position with pretty much unilateral votes from the parlament that yanukovic isnt a president anymore. Notice how it started with russia blocking ukraine from a eu trade deal, not with USA.

If USA did something remotely close to what russia has been doing to ukraine, I doubt you would be so forgiving. I mean USA isnt perfect, but you cannot believe that russia hasnt had their hand in the ukraine government, they always have, i mean yanukivic was a russian puppet, its clear from how he dealt with EU before 2014, his support from his elected was based on tying relations with EU, then he did the opposite.  Lets say both countries has expressed soft power on ukraine, and they both have, there is a red line, if you fail you cant just invade the country, thats not how it works.

They took total of 1% of whole Kursk oblast , which Russia already retaken 2/3 of, now Ukraine controls around 420 square kilometers of it (Kursk Oblast total size is 30,000sqk), for reference in January alone Russia occupied around 430 square kilometers of Ukrainian land according to Ukrainian Deepstate map project. The reason why Ukraine was able to took this land is that they attack an inactive frontline and it took Russia several weeks to concentrate their forces in the region, despite that Ukraine still didn\u2019t manage to occupy any place of high interest, like Kursk nuclear power plant or the actual city of Kursk. They didn\u2019t even come close to any of that. They attacked Kursk region with all forces they collected after failed 2023 offensive, now tell me why they attacked a previously inactive part of the frontline instead of using their forces to retake their own territory, because they are unable to perform a break through of the established Russian defense lines, so they attack an uninvolved region where Russian army wasn\u2019t present.\n\nUkraine put a fierce resistance, there are many reasons why initial invasion failed but it has nothing to do with the fact that Ukraine is definitely losing right now, and Zelensky himself already admitted that 1991 borders will not happened and Ukraine will not retake any lost territory through military means, then why should they continue fighting?\n\nRussia does not have a war time economy, you are grossly misinformed, they spend total of 7,5% of their GDP on military, Poland spends roughly the same, it is a not war time economy, Ukraine spends 60%, average country in war spends around 25-50% of their gdp on military in war. When Russia call it\u2019s special military operation and not war they mean it, they have no wartime laws, no curfews, no mobilization after the partial mobilization in 2022, which was primarily for bringing back soldiers whos contracts ended in 2022. Russia has open borders, men are allowed to leave the country. There is no wartime economy in Russia it is a common lie repeated throughout misinformed channels\u2026\n\nAgain people like you who are very uninformed thinking that you have a better understanding of the situation than Trump when he has ultimately more knowledge of the situation than you are, even for the average consumer your level of understanding of this conflict is below surface level yet you believe you can lecture Trump and his administration how to proceed. I am just a Russian/Ukrainian who has been closely following the conflict for whole these years through all possible pro Russian and pro Ukranian sources and even I do not have nearly as much information about it as Trump administration or Putin administration, you on the other hand know even less than me yet you believe you can do a better decisions than Trump can and that he is under some Russian propaganda when he has access to the highest tier intelligence in the world\u2026",

It is also conceded by the fact that Ukraine was proven completely incapable of retaking the territory past its initial success in early 2022. Saying that Russia will keep what they took is like saying that Ukraine will not March to Moscow, it is obvious to everybody that it is an only thing that can happen, no point in saying that Russia will have to give the territory back as there is no means to retake it from Russia. It is also a complete non-negotiable with Russia as they already legally claimed occupied Donets, Lughansk and Herson regions as Russian territory, same as Ukraine not joining NATO it is a bare minimum that needs to happen for Russia to join any peace talks. The fact that USA will never directly involve themselves is also obvious to everyone, if Trump even made a hint that he will send troops to Ukraine it will completely jeopardize his entire \u201cAmerica first\u201d and \u201cstop foreign wars\u201d rhetoric he run on whole presidential campaign. On top of that Russia has plenty means to escalate if even a hint of direct NATO involvement will surface. \n\nUkraine is involved, it\u2019s not like they been told that they are not gonna have a say, but it is obvious to everyone that the party that US needs to convince is Russia not Ukraine, there is no point in performative and useless peace summits between Ukraine and US where they ciclejerk each other, like the ones we saw whole 3 years prior. \n\nRussia has a right to be concerned about Zelensky legitimacy, tho it is probably more of the character assassination directed at him, still it is a legal issue as his term is past due and Ukranian laws are not clear on whether war allows for the sitting president to overstay his term. Again, Russian primary goal is probably to discredit him, tho it can be argued that any treaty signed by Zelensky without reelection could also be deemed illegitimate in the future which is a reasonable concern for Russia if they really want to end the war for good. If you support democracy you should have no problem with an idea of Ukraine holding a long overdue elections, especially when Russia already had their despite how rigged they might be.",

Thats what the ukraine foreign minister said just a few days ago.\n\nI mean if you really are saying that russia need to be worried about zelinsky, take a looooong hard look at the what is happening. I dont know if you have noticed, but a russian dictator has invaded ukraine, who should be more worried, ukraine or russia. Last time i checked, russia signed a treaty with ukraine in trade of nuclear weapons that they would guarantee their security, but here we are in a fulls scale invasion. Its kinda obvious who is getting raped here and its not putin. I mean I hate to be nitpicky but ukraine has in their constitution that they dont have elections during war times, I really dont know how you hold an election if russia had occupied 20% of their land. If they take land back again, what about the 20%, russia could just claim the 20% is discriminated since they werent part of the election and invade again. I can just go on and on as how russia can fk over their neighbor and somehow look like they are in the right.",

If Ukraine will not forfeit claim for the territory it just means Russia will always feel the pressure and danger of the conflict renewal, this whole situation is why Russia started the war to begin with, they were scared of Ukraine joining NATO and getting better gear and armor and then they could one day retake Crimea when Russia will be weak and judging by how well Ukraine held up against Russia these fears have real merit to them. In such case Russia will aim to not stop until Ukraine stops its existence in any meaningful state. \n\nAgain, what is this rhetoric had to do with Zelensky not having a solid legal claim to presidency which might be a casus belli for the conflict renewal and peace treaty revocation in the future. The morality is irrelevant, it never had a place in global politics. I agree that the invasion was unjust but it doesn\u2019t change anything. Russia is a military powerhouse with most amount of deliverable nukes in the world it\u2019s interests will be put above Ukraine always same as US interests will be put above Mexico or Canada. There is a claim that Zelensky is overdue, Russia is steadfast in their position that they will not recognize his signature as a head of state, Trump understands that and because he wants to end conflict pronto he instead of playing morality like useless EU nations actually makes conditions that Russia will reasonably accept, so the peace will come as soon as possible. And again, I personally do not see the problem with elections in Ukraine, Russia will not challenge them as you claimed as it will be literally Russia saying that their territory are legally Ukrainian and they want right opposite of that and they claim right opposite of that.",

Russia only speak force, the only force that so far has repelled ukraine is nato, and now we are even denying them that.

They lie and spread propaganda, if you want to get russias respect, you need military defense, not putins word.\n\nJust to quote you:\n\n>And again, I personally do not see the problem with elections in Ukraine, Russia will not challenge them as you claimed as it will be literally Russia saying that their territory are legally Ukrainian and they want right opposite of that and they claim right opposite of that.\n\nUkraine already was legitimate, zelinsky was a legitimate president when they invaded. and remember they invaded the first time in 2014. And if you think russia will allow ukraine sovereignty, remember what happened before 2014 when yanukovic was president, russia pressured ukraine out of an EU deal by blocking all ukraine exports into russia, they forced yanukovic to back out of a lucrative eu deal against the people will because of russia, thats why they protested, they knew the president was a russian puppet and didnt want to be controlled by them. And they where also right about russia because russia immediately invaded crimea after that, annexing the territory.

In order for Russia not to re-engage the conflict, they need to make sure that all their goals are met, aka No NATO, and occupied territories that Russia claimed will be brought under complete Russian control. I do not know what Trump is planning to do to in order to ensure that Russia won\u2019t invade again but the most proposed idea is DMZ with EU troops, plus if Russia gets what they want it will be unlikely they will invade again just to take some more territory that they do not practically need, even the territory they got now they weren\u2019t planning on getting initially, it\u2019s just a form of reparations from Ukraine, similar to the conclusion of Soviet&Finnish war where after the fierce resistance from finns Soviets took 10% of they territory instead of slightly moving the border as they initially wanted.\n\nAgain Russia does not need Ukraine to trust it, Ukraine lost the war, the guarantees for Ukraine defense are solely on US as it is the only force able to protect them. Ukraine have to trust US, they do not have a choice, as US is the only reason why Ukraine was not completely conquered yet. It is in best US interest and best Trump interest to make a long lasting peace and to end conflict on best possible terms for Ukraine, better the deal will be for Ukraine better the Trump and his administration will look. Do not confuse the \u201cbest possible deal\u201d for Ukraine with \u201cgood deal\u201d Ukraine lost the war they functionally discussing the terms of surrender not 50/50 \u201cfair exchange\u201d between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFirst of all, I do not really care but new Ukrainian regime emerged after an armed coup (maidan) where they overthrew democratically elected pro-Russian president Yanukovich. Whenever the Yanukovich was fairly elected or the elections were rigged is frankly irrelevant right now, again I do not care for moral arguments as they are useless but since you started claiming about Ukraine legitimacy it is very bad faith to ignore how new and current Ukraine regime got into power in 2014 to begin with, it was not through referendum or elections it was through bunch of people with quite active segment of actual neo-nazis amongst them taking over the Kiev by force, and I assure you that overwhelming part of eastern Ukraine did not approve of that, hence why Russia was able to organize an uprising so easily as majority of Donets and Luhansk supported Russia. Second of all, the legitimacy of the sitting president could be legally brought under question as he is long past his term. And I do not see why on earth it is a problem for him to host an election if he still has 70% support as he claims he will win in a landslide and only reinforce that people of Ukraine stand with him, it will be only a positive for Ukraine.",

Thats why im telling you trump is selling out ukraine as parts. The only thing stopping the two from sharing the pieces is europe currently. so yeah, fk trump, he is worse than realistic, he is fighting on russias side.",

Russia is weak!\n\nThey did that to Ukraine because it was all part of a plan from the deep state to weaken Russia. That's why they removed the nuclear weapons from Ukraine. All part of plan. Russia was forced to react, otherwise Ukraine would join NATO. \n\nNow Russia suffered heavy losses and won't let go. There is nothing to be done for Ukraine. I hate Russia more than you btw.",

Isn't peace a good thing? stopping the killing is positive isn't it? why Is this decision getting so much hate, atleast trump can make a decision, about something.",

But there wouldnt be anymore ukraine either. We also could say that the second world war didnt have to happen, britain and usa could just give europe to hitler, there wouldnt be any war and nobody had to die. Thats also a solution. But you are also throwing international law under the bus, we made those laws so that we wont have more war, but it requires people to respect those laws. If countries dont respect those laws somebody needs to hold these responsible, the way thats done is that putin is recognized as a war criminal and that we dont give putin what he wants, doing to the laws are basically ineffective. Especially in this case where there was only external forces starting the war, there would be no war in ukraine hadnt russia invaded. If you compare it to other conflicts e.g. syria, you could say its wrong that russia and usa backs different siden in a proxy war, there at least was a conflict domestically.  That wasnt the case in ukraine. its completely and 100% russia who caused that war, therefore he needs to be held responsible. And now we have trump blaming zelinsky for the war.",
