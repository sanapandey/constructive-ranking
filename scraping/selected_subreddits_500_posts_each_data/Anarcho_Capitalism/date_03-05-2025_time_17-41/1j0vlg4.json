Contrary to Putinist propaganda, this has saved us nearly as much in disassembly and disposal as it has cost us in \u201caid\u201d. \n\nRussia violated the treaty through action - by invading. The US violated the treaty through inaction - by watching. Russia\u2019s violation was one of perfidy, while the US\u2019s violation was one of cowardice. \n\nRectifying the situation and fulfilling our obligations now requires far more than it would have if we had acted decisively in 2014 or 2022. The longer we wait the higher that eventual cost will be. \n\nYou\u2019re making the arguments of those who fear that Ukraine, a non-nuclear state, will \u201ccause\u201d WWIII, and ignore that abandoning Ukraine will **guarantee** WWIII. \n\nYou are arguing for \u201cpeace in our time\u201d. There is no peace to be made until Russia\u2019s imperial ambitions are destroyed. \n\nHistory has taught this again and again and again, yet there are always those who believe they can trust the words of an imperialist despot.",

We don\u2019t honor our contracts.  Just ask the natives. Doing business with the us is ironically Russian roulette.",

You started out arguing that Ukraine can't win because Russia can level Kiev.  And I said that they don't want to do that and Ukraine can win in defensive war just by making the cost unpalatable and now you're saying that Russia doesn't want to level Kiev.  It seems like you're arguing my points.",

Even if they are not part of NATO that gives the reasoning to provide support.  \n\nWith enough support and continued sanctions Russia isn't going to be able to keep up financially.  Its essentially the exact same playbook that was used in the early 80s in Afghanistan.  It was a mire that was one of the reasons the USSR eventually failed completely.   I don't see Russia staying so long they bankrupt themselves, its just not worth it. Its been 3 years, we were in Afghanistan for twenty years and the same people are in power now as when we left.  I don't think Russia can keep things up that long. \n\nRight now with a pro Putin president in office its their best time to take advantage of things.  If they can entrench their position to the point that it costs the rest of Europe too much to dig them out then it works the other way.  So even if they weren't in a good place Putin would make sure to the world it seems like they're the strongest they've ever been. I don't think Russia can keep it up for 10 years and they need an end faster than the Ukraine does (assuming Ukraine keeps getting material support).\n\nThe thing that could change the long term war would be support from China.  They weren't a factor in Afghanistan in the 80s because of their conflict with Russia in 69.  If they start supporting Russia financially and materially then the entire war could be extended for a decade or more and the outcome would be a tossup especially if the US stays out of it.\n\nAll I can say is regardless of the outcome I hope this stays a proxy war.  The potential for WW3 is all too real if it breaks containment.",

This war is taking place on its doorstep, yet European nations, despite years of warning, have done little beyond incremental, often hesitant support for Ukraine. The response has been marked more by risk aversion than strategic foresight, leaving the United States to bear the overwhelming financial and military burden.\n\nAt what point does this imbalance become unsustainable? An indefinite security guarantee for Ukraine, absent a long-term strategy, is neither a prudent use of American resources nor a sound basis for transatlantic cooperation. History offers a cautionary tale\u2014Washington once extended similar assurances to the RVN, only to watch its position unravel when domestic appetite for endless commitments waned. The lesson is clear: alliances must be reciprocal, and strategy must be anchored in realism.",

I fully support sanctions on Russia and don't think they go far enough. The US asking for a bribe to negotiate peace with Russia without any material guarantees for Ukraine is an insane suggestion, and trying to cut Ukraine out of peace negotiations as Trump suggested is disrespectful. If Trump wants to back out of supporting Ukraine, put full sanctions on Russia and wash our hands of the situation... fine. But that's not what he's doing.",

If it doesn't work, then the deal falls through anyways, *because Ukraine will belong to Russia and the deal won't mean shit at that point.* If it works, the war ends, lives are saved, the deal stands, and there won't be any reason to end it, so we can continue trading with Ukraine and they can use the money for whatever the fuck they want (reconstruction, for example).",

There are two possible paths here.  Either (a) we disavow all further involvement, and allow them to fight out a war of attrition, but give Russia a stern warning that escalation to non-conventional warfare will trigger swift intervention, or (b) we *extend* our involvement, and along with an international coalition, commit enough resources to tilt the balance in favor of Ukraine and enable them to swiftly reclaim their territory.\n\nHalf-assed interventions, like trying to strongarm Ukraine into accepting an unfavorable settlement, are a recipe for disaster.

Either we are backing Ukraine or we aren't.\n\n> Ah, so, WW3? \n\nHopefully not.  Whether it escalates into that is up to *Russia*, which is who it is *already* up to.  \n\nPersonally, I think WW3 is more likely if we *fail* to respond to initial provocations.  WW2 likely would not have happened, or would have been much smaller in scale, if the allies had acted immediately when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, instead of emboldening Germany and giving them another year to prepare to invade Poland.  \n\nAppeasement *does not work* against aggressors.  We've already been through this once and saw how it turned out.\n\n> Trying to scare Putin into retreating without killing anyone with a paper deal is half-assed?\n\nYes. 100%.  Responding to violent provocations with talk is always half-assed, and when that talk involves giving concessions to the aggressors, its a sign of weakness that emboldens them further.",

But if MAD holds, then it has no bearing whatsoever on *conventional* wars, because the incentive structure that deters initiating a nuclear war applies whether you're starting a nuclear war from scratch, or escalating an ongoing conventional war to a nuclear war.\n\nIf we allow nuclear-armed powers to initiate wars of aggression, then threaten to escalate them to nuclear wars in order to deter defensive intervention, that amounts to allowing any nuclear-armed state to essentially hold the entire world at gunpoint any time it wants anything from anyone else.  But in order for that threat to hold weight, the aggressor to be willing to follow through on his threats, because the threat has no weight if you're going to cave in the moment someone calls your bluff.\n\nIn other words, **allowing nuclear-armed states to use the threat of nuclear war to get whatever they want from other states *increases* the possibility of a nuclear war actually happening**.\n\nIn this situation, allowing Putin to invade Ukraine and annex its territory without opposition simply because he has nukes would embolden him to threaten any other country he wants territory from with war under the assumption that no one else will respond.  \n\nSo this scenario will repeat over and over again, and will be used by other aggressor states, e.g. China, until someone eventually *does* call their bluff, and the only choice they will have will be to follow through on their threats.\n\nYou have it completely ass-backwards.  The fact that Russia has nukes means that there's a *greater* need to respond to their conventional aggression with conventional defense, and double down on nuclear deterrence if they threaten to escalate.",
