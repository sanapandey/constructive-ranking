So according to Sowell, this should mean minorities, and black youths, should be seeing massive job gains and wealth gain. Can anyone show me how they are doing massively better now?",

Todays minimum wage of $7.25 or $14,500 yearly when the average income is $37,600 or 38% of the average. \n\nSo the effects of the minimum wage are much less today that they were in 1963 b/c the minimum wage is less restrictive on the labor market. \n\nTLDR: Minimum wage today plays a lesser role in distorting labor markets than it did in 1963. Meaning definitely don't increase it or the \"unskilled black youths\" will be priced out of the labor market again.",
