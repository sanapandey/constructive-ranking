The government can arbitrarily decide what constitutes \"hate speech\" and imprison individuals for expressing their opinions.\n\nA recent example is the case of YouTubers Ranveer Allahbadia and Samay Raina, who are facing criminal complaints for so-called \"obscene\" remarks on their show India\u2019s Got Latent. Allahbadia asked a controversial question about an incestuous dilemma, and despite it being just an absurdist joke, outrage ensued. Legal complaints were swiftly filed, leading to calls for censorship, platform bans, and even criminal prosecution. The thing here's that politicians who were dormant to gruesome rape cases, quickly took this issue into notice and vocally demanded strict action and censorship.",

In some ways, it actually helps those who are fascists. For example, after the Years of Lead in Italy, the word 'fascism' was being thrown around all the time, leading it to become almost meaningless. This led to things like what happened with the Italian Social Movement, where they were able to say they were \"no longer fascists\" and were rather \"national conservatives\".\n2. This kinda is the same thing as the first point, but knowledge is power/know thine enemy, know thine self. Back in the 1930s, when fascism was alive and well, anti-fascist movements were much more effective because they understood what fascism was and what they stood for. Now, as fascism is essentially used as an insult, most people don't know what it really means and what fascists believe. For example, I once saw a Twitter debate between a fascist and a LibSoc, and the fascist guy was absolutely destroying the other guy--not because the fascist was right, but because his opponent didn't truly understand fascist ideology (for example, the LibSoc didn't really understand that fascism was an anti-capitalist movement--albeit one that seeks to replace capitalism with another form of tyranny--and the fascist was able to leverage this against him).\n\nIn short, if we don't differentiate between fascism and other forms of authoritarianism and what they believe in, then we don't really know them. And if we don't know our enemy, how are we supposed to fight them?\n\n3. It makes us look silly. You've probably seen videos where anti-fascists call conservatives \"Nazis\", and the comments sections are full of people dunking on them for sounding stupid. Because, in all, honesty, it *does* sound stupid. Using fascism/nazism as a catch-all political insult towards authoritarians makes you sound ignorant, and can even turn you into a lolcow for the authoritarian right.",

That, actually, almost everyone wants the same things. We break down when we start mistaking what we want with what we believe is the best way to go about doing it. But I enthusiastically agree about the capitalism bit; learning that Adam Smith was pro labor organization and against the joint stock venture - which our system is now entirely based around - my opposition to capitalism is in its current form and what I believe to be the best definition. I'm not against free exchange, market forces, and I'm largely against planned economics. Background is in finance.\n\nWhich actually gives me a great segue into the next point that I'm far less clear on. My intellectual compass' True North seems to be in line with most of Chomsky's work. To the former point, he often differentiates between *real* capitalism and *really existing* capitalism. He makes the observation that one seems to devolve into the other, but the point stands that there's a gap.\n\nI think democracy is hard. But I think ultimately it's the best reasonably bad idea we have, and all of human organization seems to require at least a couple reasonably bad ideas. Following the Chomsky, l believe anarchism is not a state of being or destination, but a way to critique current systems, and move them in the direction of liberty. My favorite quote of ever comes from his work *On Anarchism*; I usually have the quote saved to my clipboard, but new phone. Paraphrasing near perfectly, \"At every stage of history our concern must be to dismantle those forms of authority and oppression that survive from an era when they might have been justified - in terms of the need for security or survival or economic development - but that now contribute to rather than alleviate cultural and material deficit.\"\n\nDemocracy seems to be a *reasonable* way to organize the needs of a group of people. Concensus is better, and I'm well read in the moral failings of the idea, but I think if you can make democracy direct, local, highly engaging, transparent ****AND**** ensure freedom of movement so any subject can reasonably remove themselves from a community that they feel is no longer legitimate, I think you have something approaching a fair compromise between morality and efficency.\n\nIdeally we all work together together and respect that we have the same goals of the continuity and growth of our specie. But we're never going to reach ideals. So I guess to me democracy exists only to hold off other worse ideas for longer.\n\nWhich is where anarcho-syndicalism reigns. Local communities self governing with whatever systems they want. Some will thrive, others we'll fail, and we will, as a specie, have far more data to learn from than increasingly remote nation states power structures.\n\nIts been wild to watch so many promoting freedom, constitution or liberty cheer on this past month. Shrinking the size of a body without weakening it concentrates power, and of few things I'm sure, but it is the concentration of power that is antithetical to liberty.\n\nAlways down for discussions like this if you want to message me. I presume you're nit local, be it text or whatever, not much better than a cigar and a different mind to toss around ideas.",

A state usually controls territory, resources therein, a lot of activity within that territory, etc. I would guess the meaning is, the only change is: moving to minimum manipulation of minds, because control can now be maintained without that practice.\nControl by whom\u2026 even with the, relatively, most okay examples of states in history, criminals infiltrate states, always, like a magnet, count on it. So it is best to keep most forms of power as decentralized as possible, so that one region may fall to criminals or to those who do not prioritize truth, justice, or the natural law, without every region also falling. If the place somehow thrives it continues, but if it doesn\u2019t thrive, or sensible or productive people just pack up and move next door, the region decays and collapses, the criminals become too weak to defend themselves from reform. This healthy cycle is targeted by criminals and those who desire tyranny. A similar healthy mechanism is found in economics/finance called bankruptcy, and that was also targeted by criminals/tryants wherever politicians approved a central bank. When an enterprise issues bonds, any risks that it fails to recognize/mitigate may prevent it from orderly repayment of the bonds. Then if nobody rescues with new credit, and sale of company assets can\u2019t satisfy the bond debt, the bondholders may take all the equity. This just result really reduces the amount of bad managers in a society, and although there may still be plenty of shareholders who pay zero attention to the managers of their company, the amount of voting control they have is also minimized due to this healthy process. Central banks destroy this process, bad management is richly rewarded for years at a time until rate raises kill weak companies, and even then, any mistake can be erased with no transparency at the discretion of the central bank or it\u2019s closest allies/members/thralls, a.k.a. cronyism. Such a system exalts crony managers and this does, necessarily, subtly cause huge and various damage to society, many public companies crawl around in a gimp suit one arm wrenched behind their back, on a leash. That is what central banking is all about, as well as killing the businesses which have, the least debt or equity collateralizing the network subordinated to that central bank. This is my meaning for big business vs small business: the degree to which it collateralizes the central bank network. If you pull lots of side jobs and don\u2019t kick none of that up to Tony Soprano, you betta believe you get treated like small business. If you don\u2019t pay protection - your sandwich shop? gets treated like small business. You don\u2019t pay insurance what good are you, what have youse done for us lately, why\u2019s we keeping you around? Your sandwich shop is taking money from the sandwich shop down the street what DO pay insurance, if youse was to close down they will make more money pay more for protection capiche",
