RIGHT???\n\n>And surely Milei, who knows all about crypto, surely knew what rugpulls were before it happened. I highly doubt he was just a victim of his team.\n\n1 Again, another old account with almost no activity to speak off that appears to farm karma. Color me surprised.\n\n2 Knowing economics and knowing finances are two different fields.\n\n3 But let's say you are right, In order for a rugpull to work you need enough idiots to have bought the coin. So either we have 2 choices, those alleged 80 millions came from the 100-200 Argentinians who bought that because they were dumb enough, and had thousands of dollars ready to change ( haahahahaha right ), or Milei fucked the crypto owners.\n\nEither case I don't give a fuck, if you are dumb enough to fall for a crypto scam that's on you, and if you are a crypto owner you should know the rules of the game. I didn't vote for the guy because I liked him, I vote for him to balance the budget and stop monetary emission. And he's been delivering.\n\nI'm not going back to 25% inflation per month because idiots are still falling in crypto scams in 2025.\n\n>You can still support a crypto scammer, especially given the opposition, but you don\u2019t need to cope and provide excuses for him.\n\nWhat \"excuse\" have I provided ? Every time I talk about this shit, I do it from the perspective that all acusations are right, even if some are outright stupid.",

Milei is either very dumb for this mistake (oops I promoted an obvious scam on a topic I supposedly know a lot about to my millions of followers), or he\u2019s a lying scammer. Even Trump was at least open about his crypto scam and didn\u2019t pretend like he had no relation to it.",
