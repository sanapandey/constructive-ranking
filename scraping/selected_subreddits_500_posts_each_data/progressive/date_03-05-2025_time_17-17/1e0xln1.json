Trump's cult isn't growing, it's got a low ceiling and even if they gain a few new weirdos, those are offset by so much of the base being old and dying, either naturally or via Covid.\n\nThe rest is a huge pool of voters which has only grown since 2020, due to Roe being overturned, and gaining another group via learning of Project 2025. We win bigly if we all show up to support democracy.",

It's called the \"center squeeze effect.\"\n\nRanked choice will preserve the two party system for the presidency, but approval voting would disrupt it.\n\nEdit: Don't just downvote because you stan for ranked choice. I can get behind it for Congressional elections. [Here's a more complete explanation](https://electionscience.org/library/the-center-squeeze-effect/) of the center squeeze effect and if we ever pass electoral reform, it's really damn important that we get it right because we may only get one shot for multiple generations.\n\nSecond edit: [this is a better explanation](https://youtu.be/yhO6jfHPFQU?si=Fjav91kiduzsHFjz), but it's in video format and it's about 15min",

In fact, the PM has been one of the two major parties except for 80 days since 1929.\n\nI'm in favor of coalitions in Congress, but the US presidency is not a coalition. It's just one seat. Using RCV for the presidency will have zero or near-zero effect on breaking two-party dominance for that seat.\n\nTo reiterate, please, let us use RCV for Congress (I'd also love some mixed-member proportional representation). The presidency needs to be some form of score voting like Approval to get past the center squeeze effect.",
