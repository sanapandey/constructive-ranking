Edit: 10 states specifically allow those ballots to be counted, 16 states prohibit counting those ballots, and the remaining 24 states, including Georgia have no specific laws on the topic, according to research from the National Conference of State Legislatures and his vote would be counted.\n\nEdit 2: did some more research I find this fascinating... \n\n10 states explicitly permits votes be counted\u2014Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia\u2014have statutes that explicitly permit counting absentee ballots cast by voters who die before Election Day; one state-Connecticut-only counts these ballots if the deceased voter is a member of the armed services.\n\n9 states explicitly prohibit votes be counted\u2014Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014have statutes that explicitly prohibit counting absentee ballots cast by voters who die before Election Day. Missouri states that such ballots be rejected only if sufficient evidence is shown to an election authority that the voter has died before the opening of the polls on Election Day, and the deceased voter's ballot is still sealed in the ballot envelope. (Kentucky & Missouri AGs Prohibit but no laws on the books, crazy)\n\nThe rest do not have an explicit policy, which is insane! Colorado, NY, Kansas allows challenges to ballots (no idea what that means), so there's no federal law protecting someone's vote who passes, I think that's sad if they were alive and got their ballot in on time that vote should be counted.\n\nHere's the link for info:\nhttps://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/counting-absentee-ballots-after-a-voter-dies",

They're not named, but other states do prohibit so not sure if the votes are tracked in those states, very interesting. In Georgia, President Carter's vote will be counted!",
