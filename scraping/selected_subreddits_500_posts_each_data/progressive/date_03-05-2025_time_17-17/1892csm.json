If not Jon, Desi Lydec, John Leguizamo or Sarah Silverman are acceptable.  Marlon Wayans was pretty funny when he guest-hosted too, but I don't think he's a political wonk like the rest of them.",

If you don't like politics, or political comedians you should find a new show. \n\nAnd, for the record, knock it off with the childish incel garbage. Attacking a woman's physical appearance because you don't like her politics (on a show known for political satire), her looks have not a god damn thing to do with anything. Grow up you misogynist.",
