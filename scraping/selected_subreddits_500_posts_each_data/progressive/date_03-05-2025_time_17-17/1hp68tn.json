We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other\u2019s children.  \n> \n> The bond of our common humanity is stronger than the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices. God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace. We can make these changes \u2013 and we must.\n\n\n-- Carter's [Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMtxRCQa6A)",
