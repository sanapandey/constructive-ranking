Newsom's usual political stance and policies and am not sure if I agree w/his reasons for doing so.\n\n**Gov. Newsom's stated reason for his veto**:\n\n>In a message accompanying his veto, Newsom wrote that he appreciated the motivation behind the bill and shared \u201ca deep commitment to advancing the rights of transgender Californians.\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201cThat said, I urge caution when the executive and legislative branches of state government attempt to dictate \u2014 in prescriptive terms that single out one characteristic \u2014 legal standards for the judicial branch to apply,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOther-minded elected officials, in California and other states, could very well use this strategy to diminish the civil rights of vulnerable communities.\u201d  \n>  \n>Courts, he added, are already required \u201cto consider a child\u2019s health, safety and welfare when determining the best interests of a child in these proceedings.\u201d\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-23/newsom-vetoes-bill-requiring-custody-hearings-consider-affirmation-of-childs-gender-identity](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-23/newsom-vetoes-bill-requiring-custody-hearings-consider-affirmation-of-childs-gender-identity)",

Republicans and MAGA give approximately zero shits about precedent anyway so I don't see that as a real barrier here.\n\nErm, why am I being downvoted here?",

It doesn't make sense to constantly second-guess your victories because your opponents might misuse the precedent. We are not dealing with opponents who care about precedent or decorum any further than it can serve their interests. If conservatives want to take away rights using superficially similar rules we could simply *oppose them*. The thing we will have to do whether we took a win by passing this law or not.",

Without debate, legislation becomes imprecise, slapdash and pregnant with unintended consequences. \n\nWhy?
