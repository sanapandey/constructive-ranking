In this connection they must not allow themselves to be seduced by such arguments of the democrats as, for example, that by so doing they are splitting the democratic party and making it possible for the reactionaries to win. The ultimate intention of all such phrases is to dupe\n\nGuess who said that.\n\nTrump is absolutely an unusual danger, but the \"Vote Blue No Matter Who\" trolls will be continuing to spin the exact same tale long, long after he's gone absolutely somebody less dangerous is running for the GOP.",
