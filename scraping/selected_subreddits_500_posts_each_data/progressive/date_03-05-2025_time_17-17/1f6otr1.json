Or when voting on state amendments or for or against certain tax regulations. Even for President I'm not inspired. I look at the two options (and for things like President, Senate, and most state wide elections there are only two) and pick the one that will move the political equation closer to where I want it.\n\nNothing is ever going to really change if you need to be inspired to do the bare minimal of turning out to vote.",

You care about the climate, but the effects are only ramping up and not having as big of an effect on you as inflation, the job market, medical bills, etc. Rationally, one will go with those more immediate needs.\n\nThis problem is magnified when there is a two-party system along with single-member districts which the US has both of.",
