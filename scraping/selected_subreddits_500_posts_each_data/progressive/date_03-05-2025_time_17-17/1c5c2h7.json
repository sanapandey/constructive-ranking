If anything I think they're too charitable to conservatives. \n\nLet the right-wingers whine. There's no appeasing someone who's determined to hate you.",

It angered many of his colleagues, led NPR leaders to announce monthly internal reviews of the network's coverage, and gave fresh ammunition to conservative and partisan Republican critics of NPR, including former President Donald Trump.\n\n> Conservative activist Christopher Rufo is among those now targeting NPR's new chief executive, Katherine Maher, for messages she posted to social media years before joining the network. Among others, those posts include a 2020 tweet that called Trump racist and another that appeared to minimize rioting during social justice protests that year. Maher took the job at NPR last month \u2014 her first at a news organization.",

First he acted like the Muller report proved Trump/Russia was a Hoax and so NPR just dropped the story but that\u2019s not what the report says, it concludes Muller didn\u2019t think he had the authority to bring charges but that\u2019s not the same as not guilty. Maybe I\u2019ve been brainwashed and biased and didn\u2019t understand but that\u2019s what I remember about the report.\n\nThen he\u2019s also mad that employee inclusion groups are helping decide the words that NPR uses on the radio. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that. If saying someone got a sex change operation is incorrect or hurtful then what\u2019s wrong with saying gender confirming surgery. That part just made him sound like a typical boomer who is mad about times changing.",

Muller was touting absolute immunity during presidency, except by impeachment.",
