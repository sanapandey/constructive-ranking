Ron DeSantis on Monday signed 14 bills into law that cover a variety of issues, including tax collection, home construction warranties and swimming lessons for children.\n\nDeSantis also received another bill on his desk \u2014 House Bill 1285 \u2014 which deals with changes to public education in the state. He has until April 30 to sign that bill into law.\n\nMeanwhile, the new laws signed on Monday include:\n\nHB 113 - Tax Collections and Sales\n\nHouse Bill 113 amends the state statutes regarding partial payments of current-year taxes.\n\nThe new law eliminates a $10 processing fee to the tax collector for partial payments.\n\nIn addition, there is a new clause for situations involving delinquent tax bills on real estate. Tax collectors must provide additional information in reports to county commissions about situations where credit is given, including federal bankruptcies and properties in which taxes are below the minimum tax bill.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nHB 151 - Florida Retirement System\n\nHouse Bill 151 amends the state statutes regarding the Florida Retirement System.\n\nStarting later this year, retirees who have been \u201cterminated\u201d can be reemployed by any employer that is part of the state\u2019s retirement system.\n\nThey can also receive retirement benefits and compensation from the employer, though these retirees may not receive both a salary from the employer and retirement benefits during the six months after they begin retirement.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nHB 353 - Alternative Headquarters for District Court Judges\n\nHouse Bill 353 amends the state statutes regarding the district courts of appeal in Florida.\n\nThe changes allow for a district court of appeal judge to work at a courthouse in an adjacent county from where they live, provided it\u2019s within the same district.\n\nBefore, these judges would be required to live within the same county as the courthouse.\n\nIf such a judge lives in an adjacent county, this legislation could provide possible reimbursement for the judge\u2019s travel expenses between their official headquarters and the headquarters of the appellate district.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nHB 537 - STEM Music Program for Middle Schools\n\nHouse Bill 537 establishes a pilot program for \u201cmSCALES\u201d \u2014 Music-based Supplemental Content to Accelerate Learner Engagement and Success.\n\nThe program is aimed at providing \u201cmusic-based supplemental materials\u201d to support science and math classes for middle-school students.\n\nAccording to the bill\u2019s text, only the Alachua, Marion and Miami-Dade school districts would be eligible to participate in the pilot program.\n\nIn addition, participating school districts are set to receive $6 per student, though eligible middle schools would have to be in the same \u201cattendance zone\u201d as an elementary school that participated in the Early Childhood Music Education Incentive Program.\n\nThis pilot program is also set to be evaluated by the College of Education at the University of Florida, which will put together a report on the program\u2019s efficacy by Oct. 1, 2026.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nHB 623 - Builder Warranties\n\nHouse Bill 623 creates a new law that requires builders to warrant newly constructed homes for one year after the home is either sold or occupied.\n\nThese warranties involve construction defects of \u201cequipment, material or workmanship\u201d that cause the home to violate Florida\u2019s Building Code.\n\nHowever, the law doesn\u2019t require the warranty in the following situations:\n\nNormal wear and tear\n\nNormal house settling\n\nDefects caused by buyers or their contractors\n\nNatural disasters\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1, 2025.\n\nHB 781 - Public-Private Partnerships\n\nHouse Bill 781 involves public-private partnerships (P3s), which are contract agreements between local governments and private firms to help fund public infrastructure projects.\n\nTypically, local governments who want to engage in a P3 with a private firm via an unsolicited proposal have to publish notices both of the proposal itself and that the government is still accepting bids.\n\nThis legislation allows local governments to go ahead with unsolicited proposals for infrastructure projects without having to go through the whole public bidding process.\n\nTo do so, the bill requires local leaders to hold meetings to hear from the public and determine whether the proposals fit the public\u2019s best interests.\n\nIn addition, local governments entering a P3 under this bill would no longer have to publish a notice in newspapers or mail copies to each local government in the affected area.\n\nThis law is expected to help local governments fund their infrastructure projects more easily with the help of outside businesses.\n\nThe law will take effect on July 1.\n\nHB 813 - Certified Public Accountants (CPA)\n\nHouse Bill 813 amends the state statutes for public accountants.\n\nThe bill allows CPAs who are at least 65 years old to apply to have their Florida CPA license \u201cretired,\u201d as opposed to being placed as \u201cinactive.\u201d\n\nThis allows retired licensees to reactivate their licenses based on standards set by the Florida Board of Accountancy, which requires fees and additional education \u2014 around 120 hours of professional education for every two years that the license is placed in retirement.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nHB 1147 - Broadband Access\n\nHouse Bill 1147 is aimed at bringing more broadband Internet access to areas of Florida that lack it.\n\nIn 2021, the Florida Legislature established a promotional rate for broadband providers who use poles owned by municipal electric utilities to bring more access to \u201cunderserved consumers.\u201d\n\nWhile the promotion was initially set to end later this year, this bill extends the promotional rate to Dec. 31, 2028.\n\nThis law will take effect on June 30.\n\nHB 1555 - \u201cCyber Florida\u201d\n\nHouse Bill 1555 amends the state statutes for cybersecurity.\n\nThe bill renames the Florida Center for Cybersecurity \u2014 which provides education and research to bolster the cybersecurity sector in Florida \u2014 as \u201cCyber Florida.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the bill redefines the center\u2019s mission: to \u201cconduct, fund, and facilitate research and applied science that leads to the creation of new technologies and software packages that have military and homeland defense purposes or for sale or use in the private sector.\u201d\n\nAlongside that, the bill allows \u2014 but does not require \u2014 Cyber Florida to help state agencies with cybersecurity training and improving cybersecurity for government tech infrastructure, including within public schools.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nHB 7011 - Inactive Special Districts\n\nHouse Bill 7011 deals with special districts, which are units of local government created for a particular purpose.\n\nThe bill dissolves four special districts, which were already declared \u201cinactive.\u201d They are as follows:\n\nCalhoun County Transportation Authority\n\nHighland View Water and Sewer District\n\nWest Orange Airport Authority\n\nDead Lakes Water Management District\n\nIn addition, the Sunny Isles Reclamation and Water Control Board were also dissolved.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nSB 276 - Review of Advisory Bodies\n\nSenate Bill 276 amends the state statutes for organizational structure in the executive branch.\n\nThe changes require executive agencies with an advisory body to upload a report each year by Aug. 15 with the following information:\n\nWhichever statute is responsible for the advisory body\n\nA brief description of the advisory body\u2019s purpose\n\nA list of each member on the advisory body and who appointed them\n\nAny vacancies on the advisory body\n\nA list of the advisory body\u2019s meeting dates and times\n\nA brief summary of the advisory body\u2019s work plan over the next two years\n\nThe amount of funds appropriated to the advisory body\n\nA recommendation about why the advisory body should be continued/terminated/modified\n\nIn addition, any laws that create an advisory body must now include a provision that repeals the body on Oct. 2 of the third year after enactment, unless the law is reviewed and saved from repeal by being passed through the Legislature again.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nSB 478 - Lifeline Service\n\nSenate Bill 478 amends the state statutes for the federal Lifeline program.\n\nThat program aims to make communications services more affordable for low-income households, giving subscribers discounts on certain types of services.\n\nUnder this new bill, the Florida Public Service Commission has the authority to designate mobile phone service providers as eligible carriers under the Lifeline program.\n\nThis law took effect upon being signed.\n\nSB 544 - Swimming Lesson Vouchers\n\nSenate Bill 544 aims to reduce the number of child drownings in the state by expanding access to swim lessons.\n\nThe bill creates a Swimming Lessons Voucher Program, which gives low-income families vouchers to enroll their children in swimming lessons at participating vendors.\n\nAccording to the bill\u2019s text, it applies to Florida families with children ages 4 and under and who have an income that can be up to 200% of the national poverty level.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\n\nSB 958 - Local Government Employees\n\nSenate Bill 958 raises the base salary rates for tax collectors and district school superintendents by $5,000.\n\nThe bill also allows tax collector employees to be eligible for monetary benefits if they adopt a child from the child welfare system, and tax collectors may pay out a retention bonus to employees if approved by state or county officials.\n\nIn addition, this legislation lets a school board contract with a county tax collector to have road tests administered on school grounds for driver\u2019s licensing.\n\nThis law will take effect on July 1.\u201d",
