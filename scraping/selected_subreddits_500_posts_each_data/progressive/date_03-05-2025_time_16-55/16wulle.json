The PRC employs a variety of deceptive and coercive methods as it attempts to influence the international information environment. Beijing\u2019s information manipulation spans the use of propaganda, disinformation, and censorship. Unchecked, the PRC\u2019s efforts will reshape the global information landscape, creating biases and gaps that could even lead nations to make decisions that subordinate their economic and security interests to Beijing\u2019s.",
