            "body": "I have yet to have a sensible discussion with someone who supports these laws as to what they expect homeless people to do.\n\nSome believe churches magically take care of everyone. Others believe their taxes pay for some sort of homeless shelter that families can go to.  Still others think that people can instantly get a job. Don't even get me started on the number of people who have no idea that people have mental illness. \n\nThen after, you dig in, you understand that they don't care about anyone.  If you have someone like this in your life think carefully about their lack of empathy for the person sleeping on the ground.  They don't give a shit about anyone other than themselves and one day you may find yourself on the other side of their \"empathy.\"\n\nLaws like these and the people that support them have convinced me that these people don't care, as long as the homeless disappear from their sight, how this occurs.  They would be just as happy if we allow them to die as long as they are not inconvenienced and, of course, it's out of their sight.",

If you have the ability to lock up people using drugs for some period of time so they can get clean that probably will work too.

That would probably require having a well-functioning court and a law being passed to force a mandatory 7-day detox",

That's fine, but that's only going to house people who are very obviously having mental health troubles. \n\nAs someone who worked getting people into low/no cost mental health programs, it's not those who seek help are the problem. \n\nWhat about people who want to sleep on the street because of counter culture anti-government \"I dont wanna join the system, man\" types? Do we just let them do that? If we offer them free housing, it's going to require that they sit still for a few minutes while we get some information from them, which for some is going to be very difficult, because they are going to let their paranoia get the best of them. We're going to offer employment counselling, which they will turn down, addiction counselling which they'll also turn down, and mental health services, which they'll turn down as well. They may live for free in public housing, but they'll still be on the street panhandling, and honestly I'm ok with that, as long as they aren't littering or harassing people. \n\nIn the end, that's what the vast majority of Americans want - they don't want people panhandling, they don't want people littering or defecating in public, they don't want people harassing them while on drugs or otherwise, and they don't want street/vehicular living to be so comfortable that rich people decide to park their huge RVs on public streets to avoid property taxes.",
