It's the same reason restaurants and retail stores are shorthanded.

What we don't need are militarized police.  Police are still needed because a lot of people are narcissistic assholes who don't care about anyone else.  If the law won't keep them in line, they will break it.  One of the best ways to have a stand down on police militarization is gun control so that they aren't facing hotheads with guns so often.",

                                                    "body": "Cops have made it REALLY clear that they arent there to help the public and they have no duty to ensure public safety unless we are under arrest.  They are not heros, they are agents of the state there for ticketing, apprehension, and report writing.  For everything else, they are just in the way, and often worse than useless.  Need a hero?  thats a fireman or paramedic.  Not a cop.\n\nThey frequently exceed their mandate and they are systematically unaccountable for their actions, which often includes needless violence and escalation of any existing problems.\n\nThey are frequently rude and indifferent to the people they \"serve\".  They often make situations worse with their uncaring demands to dicate every situation as the primary reason they are there-- not to fix anything or do the right thing, but simply to be in charge.  \"For their safety\" they would claim.\n\nTheir training is poor compared to better run policing systems around the world.  And they dont hire the best and brightest to be cops.  In fact, if you score too high on the entrance exam, they wont hire you.  Too intelligent.\n\nThey engage in actions that would be criminal if a member of the public was doing it, such as menacing people with loaded guns at the drop of a hat, for little to no real reason.  They infiltrate peaceful political demonstrations and turn them violent if they dont agree with whats being said.  \n\nWe following each others logic so far?  Cops arent there to help anyone with the laws, and no one is required to even talk to cops.  I will talk to a judge about the law if that ever comes up, and cops arent even expected to understand the law anyway.  Civilians are expected to know the law, all of it.  Cops arent expected to understand the most basic of things.  We permit them be dumb as a post and igorant of the law, and yet insist they be in complete and unquestioned control of every situation they encounter.  \n\nCops are permitted to lie nonstop in their interactions with the public-- and they do.  Nothing they say can be counted as factual or true.  Its roughly the equivalent of talking to an angry traumatized retarded 3 year old who is carrying a grudge you dont know about.\n\nIf law is a tool, cops are not there to use it.  They are there to write their little tickets, get their high school drop-out violent jollies,  and have a judge sort out their bad actions and stupid decisions.  Judges do what you seem to think cops do.\n\nCops clear very little in the way of solving actual crimes.  \n\nCops think they have a dangerous job.  They do not.  Its not even in the top ten of dangerous jobs, and the pay is better than anything else they could find with the skill set required to be a cop.\n\nSo spare me this \"we rely on law enforcement to apply them wisely\" nonsense.  Cops dont apply them wisely and are not required to.  Judges are there to apply the law wisely.  Cops are there to write tickets and wet their pants, bark pointless commands,  and cower behind cars when people are ever actually in any real danger.  They are all worse than useless-- they are a clear and present danger to the public and not to be talked to or trusted in any way.",
