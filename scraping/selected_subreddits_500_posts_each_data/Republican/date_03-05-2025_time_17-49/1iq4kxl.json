Please keep going!\n\nIt's beyond deplorable (yes, this is now the correct use of the word, no slight on honorable Trump supporters) that the Biden White House allowed these to occur, especially the last one.  It was claiming money so they could tie climate change to ensuring the destruction of Israel through the Free Palestine movement.",

Not all foreign aid is bad.\n\nI agree with cutting ridiculous line items like that, but the majority of what these departments do is good.  Using a portion of bad things they do in order to justify a wholesale shutdown of the department does no good.  They should also be cutting out the fat from federal departments, not just randomly choosing people to fire.",

It also represents less than 1% of the budget so its like digging in the tradh for pennies rather than looking in the wallet sitting on the ground.",
