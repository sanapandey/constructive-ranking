I'm not even joking. TLDR: a group of ants (representing the people) are tormented by a group of grasshoppers (representing the government). The grasshoppers see the ants as small and insignificant. They take from them as much as they want. The ants work all day to make the grasshoppers richer. Then, one day, the ants realize there are waaaaayyyyyyyy more ants than grasshoppers, and they see that if they all start working together against the grasshoppers, they can stand up to them. And they do. We are the ants. Politicians/billionaires are the grasshoppers. It's kind of this simple. They want us divided y'all.\"",

                            "body": "The fact that this vaccine has become political is crazy to me, and the fact that who takes it v.s. who doesn't take it falls so clearly along party lines tells me that this topic is rife with misinformation. Very few people debate the effectiveness of the polio vaccine, MMR, etc. That is because they weren't rolled out during an incredibly contentious political atmosphere where the rise of social media fired up misinformation on all sides. I fully believe, had Trump won in 2020 and not Biden, many on the right would have been fine taking the vaccine, but because there was a transfer of power during this time, it became a political pawn. \n\nWhile the vaccine for covid was developed quickly, it was on the shoulders of decades of research developing mRNA vaccines in the fight against SARS. This wasn't a brand new thing, as is often spouted. As for the dangers of this drug, I have yet to see any compelling evidence in any major medical journal (and I'm not talking about what is said here on reddit, or on the cable news, or on social media) showing that this drug is not effective or that it is overall unsafe. Are there examples of some people having bad reactions? Or course. It is that way for any and all drugs ever created. But for the vast majority of people who took it, they are fine. You use the example of, if 99% of people who had covid recovered, why do we need a vaccine? Well, if 99% of people who took the vaccine are fine without any complications, what is the problem? \n\nAs for your stat that \"We have never before, ever ever ever created a vaccine for an illness that will fix itself anyway, like the common cold.\" - this actually isn't true. We now have a vaccine for chicken pox, which has reduced deaths from chicken pox by 97%. How many deaths were there for year prior to the vaccines? About 1.6% of people who got it, died. This means that about 98.4% of people who got chicken pox survived it. And yet, we now have a vaccine and children do not have to go through the suffering of chicken pox. And going even further, I bet if you, or someone you loved, were in that 1.6% of people who did die from chicken pox, you would be pretty sad they hadn't gotten the vaccine. \n\nI'm not trying to be a dick, and I don't know where you get all your information, but the covid vaccine is very safe. Do I agree with all the measures they took at the time? No. I was at home, trying to teach my son online kindergarten while I also had a toddler running around. It was hell. Do I think they should have closed the schools? Looking back, no I don't. But I also appreciate that hindsight is 50/50. And again, the fact that the reactions to how it was all handled falls so firmly along party lines tells me there is more going on here than \"common sense\" or \"doing research\". There is a political bent to your opinion, and probably to mine as well, and we should at least own up to that.",
