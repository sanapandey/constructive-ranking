Only right now, Conservatives have a far greater war machine.  \n\nThe Democrats got so greedy that they f-ed the country up too badly.  It got to be so bad that the general public finally rose from their deep slumber, and the Red wave came crashing down.\n\nBut the Democrats didn't expect this.  They didn't expect DOGE.  They didn't expect such a thorough draining of the swamp.  They got lazy.  They got complacent.   They could not envision the devesation that Trump is bringing down on then, simply by exposing the Liberal malfeasance.  They got caught with their pants down.  Now Trump is making them bend over and taking it dry.\n\nSo they are fighting the only way they know how.  Lawfare.  False accusations.   Blame Trump for the last 4 years.  Only now, we are awake enough to call BS.  The Democrats are in free fall. Trump re-built the Republican party over the last 4 years, and he spent his time, energy, and money to get the likes of Elon and others into position.  He is embracing technology to do the things that need to be done, at a speed far faster than the Liberals can handle.",
