Regardless of what the judge in the Treasury case thinks of the legality of DOGE, he violated the separation of powers by then saying the head of the Department of the Treasury also was not allowed access to the systems needed to do the job he was legally appointed to do by the President and the Senate. This judge will be impeached, so should the rest of them. Their rulings are naked partisan stall tactics not in line with the law or the Constitution.",
