            "body": "Yikes this article is crazy. The language and reporting both seem wildly biased. Using quotes around West Bank and saying \"terrorist areas occupying Israel\". Meanwhile no proof that any of this aid went to terrorist groups indirectly or directly. We know the war in Gaza was pretty brutal, we've been fighting for the last year to show that Israel isn't doing a genocide because they've been trying to aid the Palestinian civilians there, *with the help of the US*. You can, and should, be pro Israel and anti-Hamas, but this is just radical goofiness.\n\nIdk what the Somalian government is responsible for, that really just seemed like an excuse to complain about Ilhan Omar which is a fair thing to do but doesn't feel relevant, or at least the article failed to mention any reason it might be relevant. Obviously there's terrorists *within* Somalia, but it's not like Somalia is known by everyone as a terrorist supporting country the way Iran is. Not worth my time to read into right now tbh but if anyone knows more about Somalia let me know I guess, this article didn't.\n\nI haven't finished reading the 133 page SIGAR report that just came out (or any before then), but we have statements from members of Congress about spending in Afghanistan after the withdrawal. So at the very least it isn't news, but after the reading the rest of this article I have very low expectations their interpretation of the situation is accurate, especially when they claimed the money was entirely unaccountable and there was no cooperation with SIGAR at all.\n\nSo, overall, this article feels like dogshit and more propaganda than reporting. According to the statement from Chairman McCaul about a SIGAR report that I referenced earlier, the taliban got nearly $11 Million of the money that went to Afghanistan after the takeover (out of 2.8 billion). That's unacceptable and I'd rather see an article about that real thing than this slop that throws a big number at you with no information about it at all.",

Every last one of them. And if they saw this statement you just said, they'd freak the fuck out, because they've been in their echo chamber for so long that they can't face simple facts, like Israel being the homeland of the Jews, and \"palestinians\" being the ones who don't belong there, or the fact that Hamas is a proxy of ISIS",

But I read the whole article and it has no substance whatsoever. How does the money going to the Somalian government fund terrorists? How about the money in Gaza? How about the money in Afghanustan? All we know is the location these funds are going. Nothing else. You can find more information somewhat easily in other articles. It's out there, just not here.",

Influencing people of different countries can sow discontent with unfriendly regimes and can also ensure that those regimes never come to power. The best way to sow discontent is to provide something of value: food, water, goods, jobs, access to information, etc. Weve been doing this for 200 years pretty successfully all things considered.",
