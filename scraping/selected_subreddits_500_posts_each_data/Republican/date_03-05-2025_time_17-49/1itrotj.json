    "selftext": "I am a huge Tesla fan specifically for its innovation and I think Elon is bright, but I can\u2019t fully understand how Elon Musk became the vice president/president. I find America is now becoming like Russia and Asia where the billionaires blatantly rule society with an iron fist.  DOGE is a great concept but I still find it weird how they have not stated any concrete plans for what they will do with the money. And what new industries they plan to create in order to offset the economic impact of firing thousands of workers. He seems to be positioning himself for dare I say it\u2026.. presidency. And why is America now so concerned with South African politics but on President Trumps campaign he has stated multiple times that America would no longer be involved in other countries politics and seems to be keeping his word except for his new vice presidents homeland. I am pretty satisfied with some of Trumps changes but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that this will not end well. And why are we kicking out illegal immigrants but granting only a white South African minority asylum that also happens to own 70% of private owned land. ",

Have you been under a rock, or willfully stupid?\n\nFiring government employees who do basically nothing will fill unfilled positions like fast food and overnight stockers. Will also help lower our deficit. \n\nVance is the VP. Not sure how smoothbrained you have to be to keep referring to Musk as VP. \n\nKicking out illegals. Yes. Musk became a citizen in 2002. Hes not an asylum seeker. \n\nDon\u2019t you liberals love immigrants? Now you hate them? Is the fact he did it legally what upsets you? You seem like a bigot who hates Africans and minorities.",
