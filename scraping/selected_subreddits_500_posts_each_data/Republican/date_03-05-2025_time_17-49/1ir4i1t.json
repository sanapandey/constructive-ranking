But ultimately it's a gift article so anyone can read it for free.\n\nHere's one quote I found interesting,\n\n>Farmers who signed contracts with the USDA under those programs paid up front to build fencing, plant new crops and install renewable energy systems with guarantees that the federal government would issue grants and loan guarantees to cover at least part of their costs. Now, with that money frozen, they\u2019re on the hook.\n\nthis one,\n\n>The White House\u00a0[repeatedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/29/white-house-budget-office-spending-freeze/)\u00a0[said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/28/trump-freeze-federal-grants-loans/)\u00a0the freeze of agriculture funding and other federal financial assistance would not affect benefits that go directly to individuals, such as farmers. The administration\u00a0[rescinded the pause](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/29/white-house-budget-office-spending-freeze/)\u00a0after a federal judge temporarily halted its implementation.\n\n>But over the weekend, farmers reported that their funding remained frozen \u2014 another blow to farmers who are also facing threats of tariffs and freezes to foreign-aid spending that involved food purchased from American producers.\n\nthis one,\n\n>On Wednesday, National Farmers Union President Rob Larew testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee that the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping decisions on federal funding were creating concern for farmers across the country.  \n\u201cNo one knows what funding will be available or if key programs will have the staff needed to operate,\u201d Larew\u00a0[said](https://www.c-span.org/program/senate-committee/agriculture-industry-leaders-testify-on-state-of-agriculture-economy-part-1/655370). \u201cFreezing spending and making sweeping decisions without congressional oversight just adds more uncertainty to an already tough farm economy.\u201d\n\n>Skylar Holden, a cattle farmer in eastern Missouri, said he signed a $240,000 contract in December under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to share costs on investments for his farm.\n\n>With the funding, Holden erected new fencing and installed a well. He had planned further improvements to his farm\u2019s water system and spent $80,000 on materials and labor contracts that he expected would be partly paid back by the government.\n\n>This month, a USDA representative told him the funding was paused because of Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nthis one,\n\n>The funding freezes have also paused large projects across states. The Iowa Soybean Association\u00a0[said](https://www.iasoybeans.com/newsroom/article/farmer-led-efforts-impacted-by-pause-in-climate-smart-commodity-program)\u00a0Thursday that USDA payments had been suspended for a five-year Midwest Climate Smart Commodity grant that the organization secured in 2022. The $95 million deal supports more than 1,000 farms in 12 Midwestern states and encourages conservation practices in producing corn, soybeans, wheat and sugar beets, the association said.\n\n>Hundreds of participating farmers are owed $11 million after investing in new farming practices and crops because of the program, the association said.",

Do you hear yourself?\u00a0\n\nThis comment is interesting to me because it took me down an unexpected path to better understand the intersection of government and agriculture in the US. I learned through the [history section of USDA's wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture#History), that the first time Congress allocated funds for agricultural initiatives was in 1839 - 186 years ago. Holy cow! Here are some implications of this;\n\n* agricultural research was considered important to improving agricultural practices and outcomes\n* we have a long history of leveraging data science to understand constraints, resource demands, production trends, etc\n* it's possible agricultural projects had downstream effects in other areas of agriculture. For example, mechanization that increased efficiency. Think machines for tilling, harvesting crops, etc\n\nDefinitely interesting that the U.S. may have been funding agricultural projects for 186 years. To that point, it makes me wonder if in modern times, allocation to agricultural projects have a similar goal\n\n\n\n>Why? GMOs, that's why\n\nCan you provide more context on this comment? Just want to make sure I have full context",

I did some googling and IBISWorld produced a [Market Research Report from 2014-2029](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/pesticide-manufacturing/484/) that notes Bayer as one of the biggest pesticide manufacturers in the U.S. And then I did some more digging and ran into the [wiki on Bayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer), which notes that Bayer merged to form IG Farben, a company that would later exploit slave labor in nazi concentration camps (for details see the wiki section [World War II and the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#World_War_II_and_the_Holocaust)).\n\nCircling back to your point, my impression from the article is that the U.S. government contracts directly with farmers. This is as opposed to farmers working on behalf of Bayer. For example, the article mentions the program Rural Energy for America as a program that was affected by the funding freeze. That program helped farmers improve their infrastructure.\n\nOn a related note, I also have concerns about the efficacy of pesticides in our food system. At the same time, I imagine (especially being a gardener), how challenging it must be to guarantee a stable food supply to a large population. If it helps, here's an interesting article from the [Iowa Farm Bureau: Why do farmers use pesticides?](https://www.iowafarmbureau.com/Article/Why-do-farmers-use-pesticides)",

I'm not advocating for big government. I'm just saying, it's bizarre that we would ship food overseas but ignore some of the issues people are facing here.\n\nI mean, no wonder I had no idea they contracted with farmers.

And it led to me learning that some farmers contract with the government, and in so many different ways.\n\nIn general I am aware that farmers have very tight margins. But what was interesting was learning the examples of how those tight margins created a bit of a crisis for farmers who contract with the U.S. government. I wouldn't think about a farmer purchasing supplies/materials and then not getting reimbursed because their contract isn't being honored. But I could see how this would scale, like any business. As a business grows, their operational budget grows. And so does the risk.\n\nI personally don't see it as fear mongering, but I appreciate you sharing your perspective.",

I'm frustrated it impacts people who are already living on tight margins. \n\nMy paternal grandparents were farmers, my parents/aunts/uncles grew up in a farming community. So for me, I see the benefits of these communities and I think it's important to protect farms for future generations. Even from the standpoint of a family, I think it's important for children to be exposed to farm animals, gardens, etc to get exposure to the circle of life and learn food systems and what not. So there is that personal bias of mine.\n\nBut I also think it's important from the standpoint of an emergency. For example, if there was ever a situation where we could no longer rely upon imported food, it would be in our strategic interest to be able to grow our own food.\n\nBecause farmers have such tight margins, I'm frustrated it could push some of these people over the edge financially. There aren't many people going into farming (myself included), and this ends up being another deterrent for something that is critical to any society (food production)",
