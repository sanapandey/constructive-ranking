                            "body": "They do. It's not an epidemic. There have certainly been cases though. But These are just media talking points though. People on the ground are not talking about this at all and I see it talked about more from right wing media than left wing ironically. But Both of these things want to tell you what the other bad people want to do to you. They both have their own narrative about what the \"enemy over there\" is doing and what \"they\" want to subject you too. It seems they talk about eachother more than themselves. The left wing image comes from right wing media and right wing image comes from left wing media. I myself prefer to stay away from both and use things like congress.gov to just see the goings on of the house and senate without any influence.\n\nI don't know many people irl that have been hardcore \"trans agenda\" even some of the trans people I've known aren't that hardcore. There are of course exceptions. I know plenty that want to not interfere in people's private lives though. You do certainly see the agenda online, but so it is also for conservative agendas, especially since all online interaction, primes algorithms to feed you more of what you watch or read and everything's obviously very amplified on the internet. If you want to be upset about something you can certainly go looking for it and then continue to be fed more of what you hate and then circle jerk with your work buddies at the vending machine, and it's hard not to at times because it's easier to go along to get along. (And there's no shortage of manufactured reasons to hate these days) \n\n Most people right now are just concerned with a man giving himself more and more uncheckable power and lifting restrictions on companies that would keep them in check from exploiting the working class while simultaneously trying to force Christianity into our laws. They are concerned with the trillions of dollars printed during covid that sleepy joe then had to take the fall for because the trickle down from that terrible handling (whether you think covid is real or not it was a terrible handling) landed in Joe's lap. I'm not a  joe enthusiast. I never bought his flags and stickers and t-shirts and hats and NFTs and shoes and plushies and keychains and bibles and childrens books and $2 bills and so on. (Not that they even existed, and if they did it certainly wasn't here in Ohio) But that money was clearly printed under Trump. It's easily verified by checking the federal reserve site. You can look at every dollar printed since 1958.\n\nThe amount of money that was printed during that era is irreversible and set a new standard and wages have not caught up nor is it an over night fix. We got 10-15 years worth of a natural inflation process, dumped onto us in a 4 year span. The 2008 crash is not even detectable on their graph unless you zoom way in, and even then it's a tiny blip, because the amount of money printed from 2017 - 2021 (and especially  from 2019 - 2021) skews the entire chart so harshly. We will feel the effects of that magic money for a generation or more and it may take that long to catch up. It was irresponsible to hand out so much money that wasn't organically produced from a strong economy knowing that every dollar is borrowed from the future.  And we so far haven't seen anything to address these issues. Only deregulation and removal of checks to stop a man from over reach and power grab.\n\n This is what real people on the ground are worried about regardless of what media or the internet will try make us think. Sensationalism sells. There are 2 genders and there are oddities where some people are born neither truly 1 or the other and then there are people who are definitely 1 or the other but want to change. I don't think this changes their biology, but I have no problem calling \"Steve\" by the name of \"Susan\". And if Susan developed as a boy then Susan can not fight in the women's mma divisions. If there's an anomaly like being born with both or no or some of either gender, then that person has probably not had a very easy life especially through puberty. And if that person wants to have surgery to be definitively 1 or the other how could you blame them? And what tiny portion of the population is this? \n\nMy entire point is that there's a lot more nuance to every discussion than just \"all these people think this crazy thing and I'm going to assume the most extremes of that thing and assign it to everyone that didn't vote my way.\" That is the division that makes people easy to rule.",

You're statement though was a blanket one and it didn't say anything like \"this is important because I'm a woman athlete\" it just says that dems don't understand this which is just not a fair statement. It's these small things that we don't catch ourselves saying that makes it easier to see eachother as an enemy. \"The left is all this... the right thinks xyz\" as simple as this is it works wonders at dividing us and pretty soon everything \"over there\" is just inexcusable and we blanket hate people we might actually have more common ground with than not. Most people agree on this issue of transgenders competing in women's sports. It's only the media gaslighting that keeps this going. It's an incredibly rare event in actuality though and 3 or 4 events get 10,000 hours of coverage, and I'm on the side of it shouldn't be encouraged. It just isn't an epidemic and most dems would agree with you. It's just been sensationalized. I just am exhausted from seeing all my friends and family fall apart from all this \"us and them\" stuff and I just want people to come back together as a nation and a family.

It saddens me that this is accurate because I can't convey any the nuance I wish to in order to articulate my thoughts.

This is actually my nephews old account. He got me into scrolling reddit, Unfortunately, and the format of short generalizations and toxicity is somewhat startling to me and I can't text anywhere near as fast as type and my thoughts quickly outpace my ability to text.
