He did it to Biden and he literally insulted Obama and Biden in the Oval Office about not supporting enough.\n\nIt\u2019s near comical when I read people\u2019s opinions, that are so diehard to go fight Russia head on yet even the Europeans are very reserved on such an action. I wonder why? As if it wasn\u2019t obvious enough\u2026 \ud83e\udd14\n\nSome of you, I swear, when I read these comments, you think war is like Call Of Duty\u2026I may be a civilian but I have many veteran friends. This is something we do not want to do. I\u2019d take whatever diplomatic attempt that works over the idea of war.",

According to NBC News Biden had called the besieged leader to tell him that he had just greenlit another $1 billion in aid to Ukraine. Before Biden could reportedly even finish his sentence Zelensky began firing off a list of additional help he needed and wasn\u2019t getting at the time. Biden reportedly quickly lost his temper, sources familiar with the call told NBC News.\n\n> Biden administration officials told the outlet that Biden and Zelensky\u2019s relationship only improved since that June 2022 phone and never rose beyond Biden losing his temper.\n\nhttps://www.the-express.com/news/us-news/165107/bidens-furious-phone-call-zelensky/amp",

Biden's administration used Ukraine to bleed Russia, there was never any serious attempt at ensuring Ukraine could win. Ukraine has no reason to be grateful to us. \n\nRussia has always been seen by Americans as the enemy, but that's not how Trump sees things. We are currently shifting support away from our traditional allies, so it's not astonishing we are getting closer to Russia. They are an oligarchy, something the US has been moving towards with the growing power of our tech giants. We saw the power of tech leaders behind Trump when he was elected, and Elon Musk's review of government finances underlines it. By electing Trump, we chose American power and economic succeess over traditional democracy. Friendship with Russia is a natural extension of that. \n\nRussia will be able to slowly expand its power and influence in Europe because European powers have not bothered to maintain an effective defence force, but have expected the US to provide their protection for free.",

The world is watching my guy.\n\nHowever, for Trump & Vance to throw a hissyfit like that in pain view of the world is extremely embarrassing. If the world stops looking up to the US you now know why. Soft power is a thing America! Trump is throwing fistfuls of it away right now and isn't easily won back. That's permanent damage imo.\n\nI think Vance was shrewd with his \"litigate the matter in front of the press\" and he did Trump a favour there. Trump was a disaster from start to finish.\n\nRight now I give Trump the benefit of the doubt on domestic policy. Internationally its a unmitigated disaster.",

He just wants to keep doing the same thing years on end costing money and lives. If anyone looks at it realistically, unless there's a cease fire, Russia will keep on fighting. And if there's no cease fire you can't even begin to negotiate. Zelenskyy has made it clear that he wants all the captured territory back. Let's face it, its not happening. And who's going to make Russia give it back. Obviously nobody. So grind away. It's sad. I do respect Zelenskyy, but as Trump said he doesn't have the cards.",
