I hope it's okay to ask here even though I'm not part of the Republican party. \n\nDo you really think that defamation should be legal? Is it even legal in the USA? As a German I feel, that this should be a decision that is made by the German voter, not the vice president of the United States, but since he criticized that I wonder why Americans think that's such a bad thing. I think it's good that people are protected against defamation and I think the German laws are pretty balanced in this matter. \n\nI also have seen the 60 minutes clip and I must say, that it lacks a lot of context. It makes things look a lot harsher than they are. Nobody gets a fine of several thousand euros for an insult. In reality, insults aren't even prosecuted until it is defamation in the sense that it massively harms the reputation of the victim or if it's harassment in the sense that you are harassing someone so much that their health is affected. \n\nIn the clip it was also mentioned that a German politician named Andy Grothe already abused his power to prosecute someone who called him a dick. That's true indeed but I think it's important for the context, that the guy who insulted the politician never got sentenced, even though his flat got searched by the police. The German public didn't take this incident lightly. There has been a big public discussion about it and Mr. Grothes career never recovered from this scandal. He also got insulted as a dick several million times after that and nobody ever got punished for it. I think that's context that's important for the discussion.\n\nI really hope it's okay that I post this here.",

It is civil, which means a monetary penalty. Also, to be considered defamation with freedom of speech, it has to be done knowingly and intentionally, which is a high threshold to reach. \n\nAs far as the ability to criticize the government, we have pretty strong feelings on that. Unless you are threatening harm, you should be able to criticize the government.\n\nWe also believe the government works for the people, so if they are treating citizens unfairly, we have the ability to remove or oppose them. For us, it is bizarre that the government could come in and search your home for using an expletive to describe a government official.\n\nIf I didn't help answer your question, feel free to ask whatever follow-up you may have.",

Meaning the onus to challenge defamation is on the person that is defamed. It's not directly managed by the state and is handled in the courts by the lawyers and individual judges.\n\nOur search process is via subpoena at the civil level, our cops would never search a building unless it was to investigate a 'criminal' violation of the law. Where a search warrant is the most common legal document filed to investigate a place.\n\nUnfortunately our courts are very bloated due to a lot of things, and lack effective regulation. Slap lawsuits or economic warfare are often an issue, where corporations will essentially just burn money until the plaintiff can't keep going.\n\nWhat Vance said was unpopular.",

We should absolutely be doing everything in our power to support Ukraine. Besides the fact they\u2019re a democracy and we SHOULD support other democracies and support the ideals behind it. However there\u2019s another reason for the crowd that says that we don\u2019t need to support other democracies. If we successfully support Ukraine, so that they\u2019re able to tactically defeat Russia, pushing them out of large areas of Ukrainian land, not only does that neuter Russia. It allows Ukraine to rebuilt, if done correctly for the anti-NATO maga crowd, we could more or less leave Europe. If Ukraine, Poland, and friends are built up and have strong militaries there is no reason we can\u2019t have drawdowns in Europe to focus on the pacific(because let\u2019s admit), China IS an issue and WILL continue to become more of an issue, especially if we don\u2019t back Ukraine now. \n\nI think the attacks on Zelensky are asinine, they\u2019re attacking his popularity? Claiming 4% approval ratings? Like come on, let\u2019s be real, even Putin\u2026.. an actual dictator has more than 4% of the population, that actually likes him. Attacking him for not having a vote, DESPITE the fact they as world leaders are well aware of the fact he CANNOT hold an election while at war or under martial law by Ukraine\u2019s Constitution which came along way before Zelensky got elected. It blows my mind and honestly saddens me to see that we are even remotely cozying up to Putin\u2026. An ACTUAL dictator. The social media blitz against Ukraine by Trump, Vance, and Musk also saddens me(though not surprised).\n\nEdit: If it wasn\u2019t clear, I am a registered Republican, I generally vote Republican, and support most conservative issues, including what I posted above because there is NO reason other than stupid conspiracy theories and actual fake news that this isn\u2019t something we as conservatives/republicans support.",
