And then how people weaponized it. Previously Ruffo weaponized CRT when it really wasn\u2019t happening, and when that failed he saw the way to categorize the extreme left trans woke agenda combined with his hatred fort CRT and put it under one umbrella.  That is what we see now, DEI.  \n\nAnd is also my point, \u201cwoke\u201d \u201cDEI\u201d \u201ccrt\u201d are all just umbrella terms used by the right to sneak in things they culturally don\u2019t like combined with the cultural things that are popular but not liked by the right (gay agenda, women\u2019s rights etc). So it will come around in a new frame for the midterm culture wars.  \n\nWhat is annoying is once you see the cycle you can see how it is used and how not only republicans do this, but as do democrats with various terms but the democrats fucking suck at this so you get \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d that just never hit with their base.",

Anyone can apply for any job. Those with the best qualifications for the job, get the job. Dei argues that we need more people of certain races, genders, and sexualities in those jobs. They absolutely can be in those jobs, IF they meet the same criteria that everyone else meets. You support the idea that certain races, genders, and sexualities should be treated differently than everyone else by supporting the idea of dei.",

Even a competitive wage you keep getting people from around you but they are shitth candidates.  So you diversify your job marketing to include more people equitably.  You now can reach into communities to find the best candidate because you are no longer stuck with the people immediately around you or people they know.  \n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cwhere do you keep your ketchup\u201d problem. It\u2019s not diversity of race like people want it to be, it\u2019s about diversity of people from economic and geographical locations.   That\u2019s was the point of DEI hiring.  It\u2019s been around for decades under various names.  But weak executives let it become about race, sexual preference and other protected class stuff.  They fucked it up and now they are paying for it.  However the ideology will never go away because a business want to still hire the best talent.",
