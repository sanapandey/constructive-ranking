He asked the preacher \u201cis God all powerful?\u201d \n\nThe preacher smirked, he knew the Atheist would ask if God could create a rock to big for Him to lift. With the logical fallacy that if God couldn\u2019t create a rock to big for Him to lift, then God wasn\u2019t all powerful and if He could create a rock to big for Him to lift, then God still wasn\u2019t all powerful. \n\nThe preacher answered and said \u201cyes, God is all powerful, He can do anything\u201d. \n\nSo the atheist said \u201ccan God fix McDonalds ice cream machines?\u201d \n\nThe preacher stopped and thought for a second then responded \u201cturns out, there is a limit to God\u2019s power.\u201d",
