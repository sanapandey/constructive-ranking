I believe that if a horrible awful man has invaded a country then he should be stopped, despite whatever other issues there may be because literally every country has *something* going on that is unsavory. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand the hate towards Zelenskyy. I didn\u2019t hear him say anything disrespectful or uncalled for. His country was attacked and invaded, not the other way around. I\u2019m quite positive I\u2019ll be downvoted for saying any of that, but since when are we siding with Russia because that\u2019s what is happening here. I just got off instagram and people were talking about how bad the Ukrainians are and how good the Russians are. It\u2019s literally propaganda and ten years ago we all agreed on that and now it\u2019s all changed because Trump says so. \n\nHell, he barely got a chance to speak because they kept talking over him and wouldn\u2019t even let him answer some questions. I don\u2019t know any of these people personally so who knows what they are actually like or what their intentions are, but I can\u2019t believe in such a short time we went from collectively agreeing that we needed to make sure Russia was stopped to deciding it\u2019s okay for them to take *a little*.",
