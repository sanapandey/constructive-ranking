It definitely took me a bit to get used to \"X.\" I had an account with it as \"Twitter,\" but until the buy-out, I never used it much at all. \n\nAs Twitter, it was as ridiculous as FB, if one spoke in favor of Trump or anything right wing, most of your \"tweets\" would be removed, but if one spoke in favor of Biden and Crew or anything left wing, they stayed. \n\nThen people started realizing it was now a \"free speech\" platform, and with the ability to comment or post without worrying about some snowflake getting butt hurt, X became more and more popular. Now I use it more than any other social media account that I have: FB, IG, Quora, Reddit, and I've been playing around with TS a bit. \n\nThe only real restriction on X is just plain common sense with a bit of courtesy thrown in, no racism, inciting or advocating violence, and all of the obvious. Not at all, surprisingly, though people do try. I've seen more of the same garbage from the lefties, that would be banned here. But it's a \"free speech\" platform, and besides the meltdowns are pretty hilarious! \n\nThat being said, I've had some good conversations with some of them who, like adults, can agree to disagree, and I'm an old hippie, yet a hardcore conservative Republican too! \ud83d\udc75\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude01\n\n#MAGA",

I don't just get the news from TV, though; I do my own research as well as fact-checking (not Snopes or WIKI, both are extremely liberal-biased) on several fact-checking sites. \n\n#MAGA",
