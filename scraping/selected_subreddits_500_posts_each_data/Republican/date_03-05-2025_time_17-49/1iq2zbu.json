Something as simple as requiring to communicate the reason for a closed account could help.   Bank of America recently lied on Twitter about never don\u2019t this, which is verifiably false, maybe hold them accountable for misleading the public.  \n\nMore transparency here would help the public enforce a proper free market punishment.",

                            "body": "I wouldn't use the word woke specifically, but I'd say the definition of \"woke bank\" would be a banking institution that refuses to deal with customers on an ideological basis, or makes customer-related decisions or policies not based on logically consistent, financial facts or practices. Some examples of this would be banks that refuse to do business (like holding business accounts or refusing to process transactions of) with legal businesses such as firearms retailers here in the U.S. Additionally, because major banks are also the payment processors and holders of debt/credit, I would also include refusing to process payments for other legal things like sales of retailers for adult materials, such as the current issues between Visa/Mastercard and adult materials sellers in Japan. \n\nThe major crux of the issue is that banks and payment processors are fundamental to modern financial processes and business infrastructure. And these are, at least for the most part, international corporations that are run like private companies. By this, I mean that they can make their own policy decisions and who they/don't want to associate with. All well and good, but when there's multiple banks/payment processors that refuses you service and there are little to no competitors in the area that provide those services, then they essentially act as an anti-competitve or anti-business measure. A similar problem occurs when the government can override the banks to prevent transactions en masse, such as what happened in Canada with the truck convoy. Canadian banks were forced to stop truckers that were in the convoy from accessing their money and they were also prevented from accessing any donated financial aid as well. Basically, a modern-day seige.",
