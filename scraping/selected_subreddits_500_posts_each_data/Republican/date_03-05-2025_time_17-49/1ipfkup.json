IMHO tipped people should have to pay taxes at the same rate as a nurse or police officer. \n\nIf you want to make it political with evidence, good luck. \n\nBartenders and servers tend to lean Democratic. Data from campaign contributions and political affiliations show that bartenders are more likely to identify as Democrats, while professions like beer wholesalers lean Republican[3][5]. This trend may be influenced by factors such as income levels, urban work environments, and industry-specific issues like minimum wage and labor rights[4][5].\n\nSources\n[1] Is It OK for Bartenders to Take a Political Stance at Work? - Liquor.com https://www.liquor.com/articles/politics-in-bartending/\n[2] Barback vs Bartender vs Host vs Server: Which Job Is For You? https://www.7shifts.com/blog/host-vs-server/\n[3] Chart: The most liberal and conservative jobs in America https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/03/why-your-flight-attendant-is-probably-a-democrat/\n[4] Servers and bartenders bet their futures on getting out the vote https://thecounter.org/hospitality-workers-restaurant-vote-election-2020-covid-19/\n[5] Bartenders are Democrats, beer wholesalers are Republicans https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/17/bartenders-are-democrats-beer-wholesalers-are-republicans/\n[6] Facts about not tipping a server/bartender and how it affects us. https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1hdafk0/facts_about_not_tipping_a_serverbartender_and_how/\n[7] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Bartending as a Topic of Conversation https://www.eater.com/2019/6/25/18715754/aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bartending-waitress-experience-moira-walsh\n[8] How AOC Went from Bartending to Politics: Book Excerpt https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/aoc-biography-book-excerpt.html",
