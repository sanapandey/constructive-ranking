            "body": "This is the case you want to go to SCOTUS. There is a similar case called Morrison v. Olson that had the same outcome. Scalia was the only dissenting Justice at the time. \n\nIn that decision, SCOUTS does back flips to try and come to the outcomes here. [Scalia\u2019s dissent](https://fedsoc.org/commentary/videos/the-great-dissent-justice-scalia-s-opinion-in-morrison-v-olson) is about the unitary power of the presidency and such silly carve outs. It\u2019s become famous and has gained traction. \n\nThe lower court judge maybe right on the precedent. But is wrong about the law. And this is a near direct 1-to-1 so Morrison can be overturned and would likely free Trump and future presidents from this overreach against the executive.",

They want a fully developed case before diving in. \n\nSo, they may dismiss the order and then let it proceed on its merit before taking it up. Roberts did something similar last week in a different matter. But if there isn\u2019t a perception of urgency by the court, it will climb through a sort of normal path. But with Urgency, it could be pretty quick. \n\nSo, it could be weeks, but more likely months before the court would hear it. Also, the Court doesn\u2019t hear many cases after April as tradition has it. They hear most matters between October to April. After April, it would be a special case. \n\nSorry for likely the longest and least satisfying response possible.",
