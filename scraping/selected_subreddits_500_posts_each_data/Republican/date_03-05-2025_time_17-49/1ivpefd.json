            "body": "Here are some quotes I found interesting. Please note, I share quotes for folks that don't have the capacity to read the full article. But ultimately it's a gift article so anyone can read it for free.\n\nHere;\n\n>U.S. District Judge Jeannette A. Vargas said in her ruling that there\u2019s a public interest in protecting the security of personal information and banking information housed\u00a0at the agency\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, where systems are generally only used by a small number of civil servants whose jobs require it. She gave the Trump administration a chance to alleviate her concerns by providing evidence of efforts to safeguard that data.\n\n>In the meantime, DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency but is a section of White House operations, is prevented from getting into payment systems and\u00a0[other sensitive parts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/doge-treasury-payments-system-warning/)\u00a0of the agency\u2019s operations.\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n>Vargas gave the government until March 24 to offer a road map for possibly lifting the order. The judge asked for details on what training DOGE members at Treasury have or will have on handling sensitive data, information on what security clearances they have or will receive, as well as a rundown of the chain of command for DOGE employees assigned to the agency.\n\n>A coalition of 19 state attorneys general sued the Trump administration over DOGE\u2019s activities at Treasury.\n\n  \nHere,\n\n>An attorney for the New York attorney general\u2019s office, which handled the case, argued in court at a Feb. 14 hearing that unqualified members of Musk\u2019s group had access to information that only a select group of career Treasury employees were previously able to handle, a system that was dictated by privacy laws.\n\n  \nHere,\n\n>In another\u00a0[lawsuit in Virginia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/21/judge-rejects-ban-doge-data-access/), a federal judge on Friday denied a request to temporarily block Musk\u2019s team from private Treasury systems because the plaintiff didn\u2019t provide concrete evidence that the data at issue was being misused or that there were efforts by DOGE to do so. The New York judge\u2019s order is not affected by the case in Virginia. The variations in the rulings could come into play during future litigation and appeals.",

I am definitely against fraud, waste and abuse and believe that those who defraud American taxpayers should be held 100% accountable. \n\nWith that being said, DOGE's goal of increasing government efficiency and removing layers of bureaucracy had downstream effects for many stakeholders. For example, within the context of a company, layoffs can lead to less bureaucracy and as a result an easier time making a direct (positive) impact to key performance indicators. Within the context of DOGE, the downstream effects include American taxpayers saving money because the tax demands shrink as the government's size shrinks.\n\nFor me, what is most interesting about the article is that it centers around data privacy and cybersecurity. For example, the article mentions that the judge wanted specifics on how data will be safeguarded. My impression is that the biggest concern was a data breach where sensitive data on Americans became available on the dark web. Or (for example), where a hacker accesses this data and holds it ransom for X dollars. \n\nFor context, checkout this report from BusinessWire, [Searchlight Cyber Report Shows\u00a038% YoY Increase in Active Dark Web Ransomware Groups](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250211424558/en/Searchlight-Cyber-Report-Shows-38-YoY-Increase-in-Active-Dark-Web-Ransomware-Groups). For a recent example on ransomware, see the article from[ TechCrunch: UK healthcare giant HCRG confirms hack after ransomware gang claims theft of sensitive data](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/uk-healthcare-giant-hcrg-confirms-hack-after-ransomware-gang-claims-theft-of-sensitive-data/). \n\nA recently example that intersects with government is when Chinese hackers hacked the U.S. Treasury. For more information checkout [US Treasury says Chinese hackers stole documents in 'major incident](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-treasurys-workstations-hacked-cyberattack-by-china-afp-reports-2024-12-30/)'. Definitely makes me wary of the dark web and its stakeholders. Especially stakeholders that want to see Americans fail.\n\n  \nI am particularly interested in learning how DOGE plans to implement robust cybersecurity safeguards and what measures they will take to prevent similar incidents from occurring. How will they ensure the security and privacy of American taxpayer data?",

A big part of the cyber security offensive strategy is learning to infiltrate a network(or segments of it) isolated from the internet.\n\nBut considering that Elon Musk seems to have live access to analytics and reports as someone who isn't officially in charge of DOGE and doesn't seem to have a official role there, there is a question of just how isolated the data is being kept. If Elon Musk is getting to read the data and reports without having to be inside DOGE facilities, only because he is \"politically connected,\" then it stands to reason there might be other politicians or connected people with access to DOGE files. People who likley know less about cyber security and have smaller cyber security staff/assistance. A network security manager wouldn't have approved of Musk having access to data if he isn't a manager/inspector/developor/analyst/etc, unless they were made to make additional accomedations against professional standards. There is obviously also the question of if Musk does have the legal right to read DOGE data as someone whose role in DOGE and legal obligations and responsibilities have so far remained unclear. \n\nBare minimum standard practice would be that Musk has access to a proxy server that allows him access to DOGE internal network. Which technically means DOGE databases aren't entirely isolated from the Internet. It might be possible that Elon is getting his data from an analyst rather than directly from DOGE, which implies someone is taking data outside DOGE just to show Elon, which might be worse. \n\nI fully expect China to have the suffient resources to hack DOGE. In recent years, China has been able to conduct much more complicated hacking operations, including hacking of treasury, which should have had far more comprehensive and mature network security in place than DOGE.",

Pretty creepy.\n\nAdditionally, to your point, these companies don't need a security clearance so why should DOGE? And to your point, do security clearances even eliminate risk of a data breach?

I think I see what you mean - effectively that these departments are in direct contact with the executive branch and that the judge is overstepping when their ruling limits the effectiveness and impact of the department. Especially when the department is operating as an extension of the executive branch's priorities.\n\nCircling back to your original point, the article highlights cybersecurity as a concern of the judge because the data DOGE seeks to access is financial data of Americans which includes banking information (among other things). It sounds like the judge is giving DOGE and the Trump administration some time to demonstrate how they will safeguard the data they seek. This is particularly interesting because (according to the article) this data is only accessible to a handful of civil servants who work for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.\n\n  \nFor me it speaks to the struggle between the judiciary and executive branch. But more interesting to me is data privacy. There have been discussions for a long time about data privacy (and the lack thereof) in the U.S. Every time the EU introduces a rule increasing data privacy, it sparks a discussion on this topic. And now, in a political capacity, this topic has surfaced. What should data privacy look like in the US government? What should cybersecurity look like in the US government? How do we assess the fidelity of a request to access Americans' data (i.e. assess purpose, reach, impact, risks etc)? \n\nPersonally I'm looking forward to seeing what happens. Since Elon's from the tech sector I'm sure he'll get this all sorted very quickly since cybersecurity is a specialization within tech",

That would lead me to wonder if the judge is left leaning. \n\nEither way, what is most interesting is how democratic institutions and processes lead to a struggle for progress. I'm thinking the executive, judicial, legislative branches. We can make progress in one or two branches of government but still experience slowdown due to resistance or competing interests of other branches.\n\nDefinitely interesting to see these conflicts in real time.
