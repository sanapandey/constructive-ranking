BUT, that approved budget had to include \"$x for y\", $a for c\" type stuff.\n\n Like example, we would get a set amount for the entire agency to use for replacing desks/chairs. Once all the obviously worst were replaced, supervisors would start seeing what the next ones would be to need it if there was money left. \n\nIf you don't spend the money, you don't get it back. But you can't spend it on anything except what it was specifically requested and approved for. \n\nAnyways, all of that to say, the funding was very likely specifically approved for something migrant related. Very unlikely it could've been used for anything else.",

Force the DOJ to prosecute? \n\nForce them to dismiss the case WITH prejudice.\n\nRight now, they've dropped their case but want to have the ability to start all over again any time they want - dropped it without prejudice.  If it were early in the investigation, that wouldn't be an issue.  But this late in the game you don't really do that.  So the judge appears to be of the opinion that if they're going to drop the charges, the can't bring them back at a later date.\n\n>And when the DOJ says \"we have no evidence, we have no witnesses, we have no statement, the prosecution rests\" what does the judge do then?\n\nThey don't want to do that. That's the entire point you seem to be missing.  The judge would be fine with that outcome.  Do you think the judge did this to force them to prosecute Adams?  That's not it at all.",
