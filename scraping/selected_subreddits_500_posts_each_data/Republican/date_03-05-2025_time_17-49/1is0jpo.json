And there are so many in there that it is the reason why California is having droughts. The Mexican cartels were hanging out down there smoking cigars and set the pile of Ukrainian war weapons on fire, which activated the underground sprinkler system which used up all the water. When the wildfires came last month, there was nothing left, so that\u2019s why LA burned down. Biden tried to cover it all up, that bastard. And related to that- Did you also know that Biden stole Elon\u2019s genetic material from the IVF bank and used it for a vampire facial? He was trying to steal some of elons essential force, like dark crystal style- I mean who wouldn\u2019t want to. But thats why everyone high up in the 1% greatest are so pissed at him- it\u2019s just gross right? Who does that actually. I can\u2019t even keep up with the info download coming in now that the faucets are open and flowing. When he says he is going to drain the sewer I hope he means the California underground cartel ones. We can\u2019t handle any more air accidents and I just know they are involved, I can just feel them scheming down there. I don\u2019t even care how. Yesterday I went outside and just started shooting at the ground- but I can\u2019t do it all myself. It\u2019s a big job, no thanks to Canada. We deserve those Ukrainian minerals. In fact, by my calculations they are at least 90% ours because we did Vietnam and like every other one for everyone. It\u2019s time to take our cut. Clear cut the mess and give it that Midas casino touch. If you know you know and for everyone else- just stay with your eyes focused out. Answers are within if you know who to ask.",
