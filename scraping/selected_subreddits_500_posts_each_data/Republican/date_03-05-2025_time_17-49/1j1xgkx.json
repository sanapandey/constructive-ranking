He bought it and in 6 months I was getting all kinds of weird push notifications for people I don\u2019t follow who I found to be ignorant. Then the porn bots went from once a week to six a day.\n\nBluesky is a much more functional product for me, my friends, and my wider network (mostly writers and comedians.) I\u2019m sure like every social network it will turn to shit one day too, but I\u2019m enjoying it for now.",

After all that it functions damn near the same aside from getting bot DM's at times which are typically caught in the spam folder. A very minor problem in exchange for cutting millions in payroll. You can disable recommended tweets or any notifications. Most importantly, when Elon took over he stopped the suppression of conservative voices. Something i think someone in a republican subreddit can appreciate. Although i highly doubt someone advocating for Bluesky is republican. \n\nX is better because that's where everyone actually is. I use X for sports and politics, and EVERY notable reporter and politician is on X. Same can't be said about Bluesky. Not in the slightest.",

Most of the people I\u2019m interested in hearing from that are \u201ccelebrities\u201d are probably more like B-List and C-List comedians and some famous authors. I don\u2019t really care about the big name Hollywood types or sports stars. \n\nLike anything it depends on your use case, but for me, it became a pointless mess. Most of what I was seeing in my feed became entirely irrelevant to me - they weren\u2019t people being retweeted by my network but, like, 5 randos with weird, intentionally sensational takes for every 1 person I actually recognized the name of. It started 8 months before the election and got exponentially worse until I finally quit because the website was completely useless, just like Facebook is with all the ads and random group suggestions clogging feeds.\n\nBluesky was a breath of fresh air after that. No ads, just content I\u2019m interested in. Very happy to be there.\n\nBtw, thanks for having a real conversation about this without attacking me - I\u2019m an independent who occasionally votes Republican depending on the candidate and usually this sub attacks me for disagreeing with a single thing that veers from the cult.",
