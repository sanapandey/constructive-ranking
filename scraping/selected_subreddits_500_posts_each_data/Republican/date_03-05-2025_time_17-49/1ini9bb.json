Their audits have been progressively getting better since. I'm guessing they'll finally pass an audit on schedule and whoever is in power will take credit for it. It's not like money is *missing* or stolen or something. it's just not tracked in an auditable way. Which is a problem, but one that is getting fixed in what seems like the right way. That is to say, a way that preserves the function of the department rather than shutting everything down and burning it to the ground.",

Give it a try and please advise how this was used to fund tourism in Egypt (by Trump administration, it it helps).\n\nIt is one thing to be transparent, but, its another to blatantly lie/ twist things.  Even in the official [whitehouse.gov](http://whitehouse.gov) page - use partisan right-winged sources feels just finding some sources they read to beef up their claims with no credible proof. None of these articles talk about \"fraud\"\n\nTo me, I am happy to see this. However, it is purely for theatrics. Like a kid doing some half-hazard work to show his teacher/ parents - homework is done.\n\nYou may certainly be against DEI - which is totally fine.

They do not consider it wasteful/ abusive/ malicious/ fraud. \n\nSome of my observations, from **actually reading the content**\n\nFirst 5 - are from one [DailyMail.co.uk](http://DailyMail.co.uk) Article that \"House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast (R-Fla.)\" lists without offering any concrete evidence except \"trust me bro\".\n\n$6 million to fund tourism in Egypt --> This is twisted title.
