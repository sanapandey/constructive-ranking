    "selftext": "Hello, Lithuanian here!\n\nObviously, this is just an unconfirmed rumour, but there's been some talk about the potential withdrawal of US troops from the Baltic region.\n\nLithuanians, along with other Baltic nations, remain firmly committed to NATO and our mutual agreements with the US. Recent discussions with Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth have been positive. That said, many of us are uneasy about the current state of the world order as it seems to be crumbling. \n\nI'm hoping to step out of my echo chamber and hear different perspectives. Would you support US troops leaving Baltic States? Or do you believe their presence is essential for our vulnerable region?",

For over 75 years we've stood between Russia and its European ambitions while much of NATO failed to pull their own weight.  Now we are broke and weary of your burden and we tire of global anti-American rhetoric.  It's time to tend our wounds and Europeans should take up the flag of their own defense.  We remain your allies, but cannot continue to be your patsies.",

My country fell behind the Iron Curtain nearly 80 years ago. We had a long and bloody partisan war after WWII ended for the West. We lost our best people. During 50+ years of occupation, the US remained our beacon of hope.\n\nNaturally, I grew up very pro-American. Regardless of which party is in charge, we\u2019ve always considered you our top allies. We are small but we pay our share.",

Your intentions may be good, but the results end up achieving the exact opposite.

And then it will weaponize the justice system to go after anyone who disagrees with it.  And it will attempt to interfere in the electoral process.  \n\nThat's exactly what the Left did in America and one of the major reasons Trump got elected.  People realized that it was the Left that was suppressing their basic civil liberties and threatening democracy.  The Left's attempts to categorize any speech it didn't agree with as \"hateful\" turned the Democratic Party against democracy, and the American people against the Left\n\nThere's an old saying that \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\".",

The US will definitely fight for NATO and pull its weight if that scary day comes. We also have China growing at an insane rate and do need to collect ourselves and have our own modern day resurgence. It\u2019s also wise to consider that there are things going on behind the scenes that could have prompted that move. As an American who has grown up admiring, fantasizing, studying, and then opposing any war, I would throw my hat in the ring if Russia strikes any NATO country. I\u2019d advise taking a note out of Canadas book to keep calm and carry on!",
