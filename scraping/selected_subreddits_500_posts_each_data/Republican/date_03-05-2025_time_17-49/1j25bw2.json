It\u2019s inexcusable no matter where it comes from, and the fact that the community at large and the site itself seem less willing to acknowledge that when the aggression is directed toward conservatives is reasonable cause for caution. \n \nI will suggest, however, that the temperature is up everywhere. I know people who receive death threats for expressing that they want the right to marry whom they love or that they support more stringent gun control. Obviously that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that the prevailing winds on Reddit blow left, and so your caution is still absolutely understandable. I just want to suggest that it isn\u2019t a zero-sum game; it\u2019s over the top and dangerous on the right, too. (Nor do I think you\u2019re ignorant of any of those facts. It\u2019s just worth putting the whole picture out there.)\n \nAnd I think it\u2019s conversations like this, where we can recognize and name extremism in any form, that can turn the temperature down a little.

Since then my viewpoints on many subjects have either strengthened or changed, but that's only due to three things, live experience, free speech, and free debate.\n\nLeftists are those of the brainwashed cult who believes everything that is right of them in any capacity is a legitimate Nazi, fascist, etc.  They eagerly scream that Kamala only lost because of racism and sexism.\n\nLiberals are at least of a left leaning ideology but still retain the capacity for debate and decent conversation, and if we ban them, we'll never be able to have that potential of moving them to our side.  The open arms coalition against the radical extremism of our political landscape is what won Trump the office in 2024.  Let's keep that mindset strong, that the Republican Party is just that, a Party, of vastly different backgrounds, beliefs, and ideas, formed under one coalition, under one roof, united to stand against extremist ideology.",
