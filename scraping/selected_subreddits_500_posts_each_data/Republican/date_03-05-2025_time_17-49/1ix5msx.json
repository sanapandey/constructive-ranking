The Democratic party has made it clear they have no key contender against Trump (that they'll actually endorse) and no clear idea of how to oppose Trump or counter him. They're inept. The average Democratic voter is depressed at the party's response and powerless to effect any change because most Trump voters are in favor of the changes, making protest turnout minimal. The funding isn't the issue, it's the lack of action by their representatives. I have no doubts the \"slush fund\" claims go throughout both parties and you'd be an idiot to assume only 1 party is an offender, but that's not the cause of the effect you're seeing.\u00a0\u00a0",
