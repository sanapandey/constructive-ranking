    "selftext": "Hey guys genuine question here that I wasn\u2019t allowed to post in r/askconservatives , probably due to their sub being spammed with Ukraine and Trump related questions and assumed I was a troll or something. Anyways I\u2019m genuinely curious and want to know what my fellow Conservatives think. What\u2019s the point of Trump negotiating a peace treaty in Ukraine if he doesn\u2019t plan on America doing anything in any case? You would assume if America\u2019s negotiating we\u2019d be somewhat involved be it with sending troops to help administer a neutral zone or to guarantee Ukraine post-war but Trump has stated he does not intend for America do either or increase aid for Ukraine if the deal fails. If this is the case why even bother negotiating if we\u2019re not going to get involved no matter the outcome? For the sake of being world-police? Also why should Ukraine accept any deal they view unfavorable now if they know the U.S. won\u2019t support them even if they did sign the deal and why would Russia accept a deal if they know America won\u2019t aid Ukraine anymore even if they don\u2019t end the war? I just don\u2019t see any point in Trump negotiating if America doesn\u2019t have any involvement on the outcome, either just pull out and let them deal with it or actually have America involve itself in the outcome.\n\nEdit: added a random url because apparently we need attachments even if it\u2019s a discussion post, don\u2019t know what\u2019s that\u2019s about",

If the EU does increase aid to supplement the decrease in U.S. aid, as Vance and Trump have suggested, they would become the lead partner on their side. And again idc if Russia has some petty dislike of Europe they\u2019re not gonna continue a war killing tens of thousands of their own people, ruining their economy, and destroying their global image because of some petty dislike they have towards the eu. You think Putin\u2019s going to say \u201csorry guys the wars continuing for another decade because the EU is stinky and stupid.\u201d",
