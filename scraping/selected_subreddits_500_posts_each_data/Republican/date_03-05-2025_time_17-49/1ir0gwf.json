So maintaining a primary use of Gulf of Mexico, which noting the Gulf of America name is the appropriate thing to do. \n\nMountains, like the Denali to Mt McKinley change, are 100% inside the US and are also not referenced outside of the US. It\u2019s also not been named Denali for very long anyway, roughly 10 years. Many people didn\u2019t even know it was changed to Denali in the first place, I personally forgot.",

The style guide includes other things like how to refer to Taiwan, how to uses pronouns (also something that caused controversy), what name to use for mountains completely inside a country (they updated the style guide from Denali to Mt McKinley), how to write numbers, how to write dates, etc. \n\nThe style guide has to navigate this type of thing on a regular basis due to changing name and they try to remain impartial on the style. If the majority of countries agreed to refer to the Gulf as GoA, they would likely go ahead and update the style guide to reference the new name as the primary name. But there are 7B people in the world. Only 340M live in a country that will use the GoA name and many of those people will continue to refer to it as GoM. \n\n\nFor reference, here is the announcement from AP as to how they will refer to the Gulf of Mexico. \n\n https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to note, that the next Democrat president will change it back. And history shows that the next president will likely be a non-Republican.",
