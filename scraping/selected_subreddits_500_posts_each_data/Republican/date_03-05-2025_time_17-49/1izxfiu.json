ALSO, I dont know if I'd call it a terroist threat as much as something like intolerance to intolerance; however, I'll admit a little bit bias is showing in that point.

But for an additional example, the border Czar recently promised to \"bring hell to Boston.\" Do you take your same stance of terrorist threats here? bc to me, they seem like the same thing.\n\nOut of curiosity,  someone else commented here that we should remove the protected people alws all together.

With a quick Google search I feel that it is not considered a terrorist threat, least in the context I'm seeing. It appears to be aimed at the legislation of Boston less so the city itself, but I could be very wrong and there is more to the story that changes the context. it also takes on a different meaning coming from a person in power vs a regular citizen. Example: Putin saying \"we will attack America\" vs some Russian citizen saying the same thing. same words but the implication is vastly different. I feel like that can be applied but again that is just my take, and I very well could be entirely wrong\n\nContext for my answer: [Trump\u2019s border czar vows to bring \u2018hell\u2019 to Boston over immigration policies | GBH](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2025-02-24/trumps-border-czar-vows-to-bring-hell-to-boston-over-immigration-policies)\n\nto the second question of the protected people's laws let me preface this by saying in a perfect world everyone would be on a level playing field where one group being protected over the other shouldn't be a thing and everyone is equal, but I concede that this is not how things have gone. My stance on such laws from the research I have done. No, I do not believe they should be removed as they still function as originally intended. now there are people taking advantage of them, but this is true of any system built to aid those who cannot aid themselves",

However, I do still perceive Hoffmans quote as a threat even if it's directed at the laws and not necessarily the people. Mainly because legally, he has no justification to say or do anything as police departments are not legally required to assist ICE or its operations. I think the point at which I'd be okay with it is if Boston police were arresting ICE agents or outing them to the public; direct obstruction, you know. But at this point, all they've done, as far as i know, is refuse to take part in ICE operations which their prefectly allowed to do.\n\nOkay, I'm glad we can agree that discrimination does still exist. Who do you think is taking advantage of these systems? The whole reason I aksed is bc, just from personal experience, I find that a lot of right leaning people, not necessarily you or anyone you're associated with, either refuse to accept that it still exists (direct from my own family's mouths as theyve tried to convince me that there isnt prejudice anymore) or they are a part of the issue. I'm from the midwest, so I mean ofc I gotta bring that we literally just had ACTUAL swastika flying Nazis in Cincinnati.",

None of the MSM that I have seen, so far, have covered the detransitioner who came out to speak in favor of these changes. Their opinion and views should be something people would want to hear because they were on both sides of this issue in their lives.
