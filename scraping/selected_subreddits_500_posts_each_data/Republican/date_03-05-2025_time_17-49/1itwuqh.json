I would like to see a peace deal reached between Ukraine and Russia, but like the article stated, Ukraine most likely won't gain all the land they once held. The Donbas and Luhansk will moat likely be absorbed into Russia or remain client states. These areas hold industrial significance to Ukrsince and that loss will hurt their national economy. \nThe US is sending military equipment that is outdated and we could loan Ukraine the equipment and once the war is finished collect some of the money back. That would be a recoup some of the money the equipment, however outdated it was, back. Once a peace deal is reached and finalized, Ukraine should hold elections since their constitution prohibits elections during martial law. If Zelenskyy wins again, good for him.",

With the UK finishing the payments in the 21st century. \n\nUkraine had allocated budget to debt repayment. They also did conduct some privatisation and eased foreign investments in their MIC, energy investment, and natural resources over the years after invasion, and they obviously also issued a lot of bonds. Ironically, after Trump's rambling, the value of Ukraine's bonds, Ukrainian currency, and stock market decreased. This means any bonds held by the US, IMF, or private banks in the US are worth less now.",

Soviet Union continued payment to the US until after some disputes which resulted in Soviet Union and US government reaching an agreement to have the remaining debt be paid in form of non-cash repayment through cancellation of grain shipment debts, and undisclosed amount of shipment of minerals. \n\nRepublic of China's failure to pay debt was mostly due to losing Chinese civil war, An American solider raping a Chinese student and US government claiming the woman was a prostitute which resulted in nation-wide protests right before the Communists offensive didn't help the matter. Nevertheless, Republic of China was repaying it's debt even as the war was going on, and around 20% of China's government expenditure during world war 2 was debt repayment. What was left of the debt was mostly written off after ROC's exile to Taiwan, as Taiwan economy became subsided by US until 1970s.\n\nFrance's debt to US would later be restructured or forgiven under Marshall plan. France would repay around 700 million dollars from marshal plan loans. Interestingly one of the things US made France do as part of Marshal plan was ending French policy of only French movies being allowed in French cinema's. unrelated, just a fun fact. \n\nregarding your point 2: Yes, those may be in the best interest of Ukraine. And US investors and stakeholder are already seeing the value of their assets reduce as soon as Trump called Zelensky a dictator. Debt repayment scheme of Ukraine as negotiation with IMF(Which has US and it's private banks as major stakeholders) involves Ukraine paying their debt with in their own currency, which also saw hit after Trump's statement. So, thanks to Trump's factually false statements backed by no credible source(like saying Zelensky has 4% approval rating) United States is already getting less repayment from Ukraine in terms of dollar value.",

                                                    "body": "Your argument hinges on a loose interpretation of \"returned US money\" and conflates different types of aid and repayment scenarios, so let\u2019s clarify with facts.\n\n1. Soviet Union: The claim that the USSR \"continued payment\" until a non-cash settlement is misleading. The USSR received $11.3 billion in Lend-Lease aid (1941-1945). Post-war, the US initially sought $1.3 billion in repayment, but Stalin resisted, famously arguing the debt was paid in blood. Negotiations dragged on, and in 1972, the USSR agreed to pay just $722 million\u2014less than 7% of the original amount\u2014spread over decades, with payments halting after 1973 due to trade disputes (e.g., the Jackson-Vanik amendment). The \"non-cash repayment\" via grain and minerals is speculative and not well-documented as a formal settlement; the remaining debt was effectively written off after the Soviet collapse. Russia paid $674 million in the 1990s, tied to a trade deal, but this was a political gesture, not full repayment. So, no, the USSR did not \"fully repay\" Lend-Lease.\n\n2. UK: You\u2019re right that the UK repaid something, but it\u2019s not the Lend-Lease debt itself. Lend-Lease aid ($31.4 billion) was mostly free or written off\u2014materials destroyed or returned didn\u2019t require payment. The UK\u2019s 21st-century repayments (finalized 2006) were for a separate $4.33 billion postwar loan (1945 Anglo-American Loan), not Lend-Lease. Conflating these distorts the picture.\n\n3. Republic of China (ROC): The ROC received $1.6 billion in Lend-Lease. Yes, it made payments during WWII\u2014about 20% of its wartime budget went to debt servicing\u2014but this collapsed after 1949 when the Nationalists lost to the Communists. The US wrote off most remaining debt after the ROC retreated to Taiwan, subsidizing its economy instead. Partial repayment during the war doesn\u2019t equate to \"fully repaid,\" especially since the bulk was forgiven.\n\n4. France: France got $3.2 billion in Lend-Lease, largely written off post-war since most materiel was destroyed or consumed. The $700 million you cite ties to Marshall Plan loans (1948-1952), a separate program totaling $2.3 billion for France. These were restructured, with much forgiven under lenient terms (e.g., 2% interest over 35 years). The cinema policy shift was a cultural concession, not debt repayment. Again, partial Marshall Plan repayment isn\u2019t Lend-Lease repayment.\n\n5. Ukraine Context: My original point about \"returning US money\" was likely a rhetorical jab at current aid dynamics, not a literal historical claim. Your tangent on Ukraine\u2019s privatization and bonds doesn\u2019t address repayment to the US\u2014it\u2019s about their internal economic strategy. Post-2022 invasion, Ukraine\u2019s received over $100 billion in US aid (grants, loans, military support), with no repayment yet beyond symbolic gestures. Bond value drops hurt investors, not US taxpayers directly.\n\nYes, *some* European countries returned *some* money, but the \"all repaid\" claim for WWII Lend-Lease is false. The USSR, France, and ROC didn\u2019t fully repay Lend-Lease\u2014most was written off or unresolved. The UK repaid a postwar loan, not Lend-Lease itself. Partial payments don\u2019t make the broad assertion true. Historical repayment is a mixed bag, not a clean \"yes.\"",
