So if they're banning low efficiency ones the problem with the high efficiency ones to get the same gallons. They are bigger in diameter. Often small homes have a room just barely big enough for the hot water tank and the furnace. A bigger hot water tank simply won't fit. \n\nThe plan to ban all natural gas and propane hot water heaters, and stoves/ ovens is completely ridiculous. First off, if everybody switched to electric, the power company could not keep up with demand and electrical prices would skyrocket... Secondly, a lot of houses would not have a large enough electric service. If you have to go buy a new hot water tank and stove you have the cost of the appliances and then another $15,000 or more for the electric service upgrade. It's almost like they're intentionally trying to bankrupt the poor and middle class.",
