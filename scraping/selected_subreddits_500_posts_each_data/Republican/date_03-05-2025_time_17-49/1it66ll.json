This isn't a left or right issue. The judge can rule that way and it can get overturned by the supreme court if they determine Trump is in the right.  Trump has already won several cases where a judge stepped in and then it gets overturned. Trump isn't perfect as no person is, he can make a mistake and its ok for us in here to admit and recognize that because we actually want to hold our representatives  to account unlike the democratic side.",
