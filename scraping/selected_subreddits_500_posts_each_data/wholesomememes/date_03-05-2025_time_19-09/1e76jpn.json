She and my dad had just moved in with my family after years of planning months of packing and both of us selling our homes in different states and finding the perfect property to purchase together to finally live this dream we had been waiting for for 20 years! She and I had so many plans, projects, overall\u2026she was my purpose at least for the next 5 years I was so excited that I was going to wake up to the sounds of her every morning and have her back in my family\u2019s life and my dad in my sons life again. Then, unexpectedly on the day we signed the papers for the property we went home and she had a 3rd degree heart block in my living room and was pronounced at the ER\u2026none of us thought she would be gone when we got to the hospital. It has taken time. Nothing felt like home for a long time. We all had to find a new purpose for even breathing every day\u2026My mother touched so many lives throughout her 73 years. She was an incredible soul and the pain of her loss is still there and like a searing hot poker in the center of my chest when I focus too hard. So I just keep moving, I let myself cry, I scream when I need to scream, I buy a chicken when I need to lol I raised chickens and ducks\u2026the ducks are my favorite though. I hug my dad. It gets easier to breathe as the time passes\u2026but you\u2019ll never stop loving or missing them. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m so sorry for your pain. It\u2019s so real and so deep. It\u2019s pain that lets you know you\u2019re alive while at times you feel like you\u2019re dying. But you\u2019re not that lucky\u2026but I can tell you, I watched my mom be greeted by her mother and father aunt, uncle, and grand mother and grandfather. After she passed. She spoke to me and said, \u201cI will see you again.\u201d I\u2019m not a religious person. Im spiritual NOT RELIGIOUS and I know what I saw and heard. It was real. It was the moment she left this earth and she made sure I knew just like we talked about. It\u2019s the only thing that has brought me any kind of peace is knowing there really is something after we pass, b because my mother ensured to show me as I asked. So just know. We will see them again, and when you feel him with you, it\u2019s because it is him. I hope this brings you comfort. I hope your heart feels a little less heavy. I wish you peace and healing and strength. Blessed be.",

I love the huge grin he gives me! I get a butt pinch and an I love you! There's no better way to start my day.\n\nThe next thing is when he comes home. I really start watching the clock and getting excited. When he walks in I run and jump into his arms and smother him in kisses. I want him to understand how much I love and cherish him.
