One said it's women's fault that they get weird and we get uncomfortable, one said women are \"mean\" and that's why they take compliments as flirting. One said women's compliments only matter to me because I already get male validation (my husband), but I don't want or need male validation. I didn't enter my relationship by pandering to him, we are together because we are a natural fit. And it always makes my day when my female friends or strangers say something kind to me, and it has nothing to do with my husband. A cashier once told me as she was ringing me up \"you're so pretty!\" A little girl said it when I was leaving my apartment and she was outside playing. A woman recently told me I look \"darling\" and \"like a fairy\" because she liked my shirt. Maybe men need to craft better compliments for each other, and normalize that as friendly behavior and not romantic or sexual. Maybe men need to think about why they only take positive feedback seriously when it comes from someone they may want to sleep with, and what that means about the compliments they give. I have male friends who compliment each other all the time and I can tell that means a lot to them, because they have moved past whatever hangup the guys in the comments seem to have. My male friends also compliment other women and we know they're not flirting, so we are able to compliment them, too. Because they don't get weird about it! And that proves that women are perfectly willing to offer the same feedback to men that we do to other women if they respond appropriately.",

Because, and I know that you might have never heard this before, but, this isnt about you! Astounding, I know! This is about men receiving very little positive reinforcement from anyone, including women. So, under no surprise from anyone with half a brain-cell to activate, men misinterpret compliments from women as flirting, because flirting is the only scenario where we get compliments from women.\n\nYou're literally telling us that this issue, that you've had just as much of a role in perpetuatng as men have, isnt your responsibility to help correct, because the obvious symptoms of that exact issue are too inconvenient for you to deal with. So great job! Very helpful!\n\n>and you also think men's compliments don't count\n\nNever said that, but if you're this desperate to find excuses for yourself, go off. Its very important for men to comiment eachother, and half the comments in this post reinforce that. Unlike half those posts, Im not about to give women a get out of jail free card for a cultural issue they're also just as guilty for perpetualing.",

Compliments aren't mandatory, common decency is.\u00a0\n\nAlso, what even is the point of your comment? What action would you have me do differently? I'm not insulting men or giving them a side eye *or even being standoffish* I am literally just not randomly offering compliments. You are more than welcome to go around and do that yourself.\u00a0",

People like me are lonely, sad, overworked, tired, and if we ever talk about it, we are treated horribly by everyone, and they will remind anyone about it forever. \n\nBack in my twenties, I had a dead-end job, and one guy slipped. He was tall, looked great, and had a wonderful build. He was clever, wise, and the smartest person in every room I had the pleasure of working with. His fashion was on point, and he had a family he was saving to start his career. He was lucky and was riding great sales and clients, so he was making good money. \n\nThen it happened. He let go of the mask one time, and he mentioned his father's death and how it affects him still. \n\nEveryone in the room started to turn into a comedian at his expense. This went on for weeks. He left, and we lost touch. They were still cracking jokes about him. \n\nI quit that job and never looked back. \n\nEvery once in a while, I see a profile that is recommended to me. There are still group chats that are still making fun of him.",

You can agree or disagree with that assessment, but it resonates with me in that, subjectively, (a) women are not likely to compliment men for fear of being misinterpreted  and (b) men are less likely to compliment men because emotional vulnerability and intimacy are not traditionally masculine traits. \n\nThis is going to vary based on age, culture and location, so maybe your experience has been different, but you can acknowledge that a lot of men don't get all the positive reinforcement they would like without making it a woman's fault, like an incel would. \n\ntl;dr tell your bros that they light up the room",

Or that giving positive reinforcement can sometimes cause the bullying to the person giving it (e.g. \"are you gay?\").\n\nThe framing is that the society is not giving them positive reinforcement. Men have to do what the society doesn't do for them. What society are we talking about that \"excludes\" men? In my perspective, the word \"society\" is a placeholder for the word \"women\". Just at attempt at normalizing a common incel talking point. My point is further underscored by the last sentence of this post where OP says that \"men will never forget those compliments\". An extremely common thing that a lot of men say is how a woman complimented them once and now they've been \"remembering it since then\".\n\nThe main issue is that most things you could compliment about an average man, especially here on reddit, is the list of their game achievements. Men are not encouraged to put effort into their outward appearance. This meme implies that current society is unjust. And that a \"just\" society would give complements to men. But again I ask, for what?\n\nYou're implying that actually men have countless different things that one could complement. Your point, as I understand, is that despite a wealth of outward, positive traits, men are kept from complimenting each other by the standards of our culture. But this is not the case. Men are not encouraged to dress good so they can feel good. Instead they're encouraged by this post to feel like they deserve the compliments for doing what they're already are doing.",
