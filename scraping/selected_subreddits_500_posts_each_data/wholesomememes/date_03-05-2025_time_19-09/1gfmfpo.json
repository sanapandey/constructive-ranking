It took me years to slowly rebuild my life back and reframe a lot of mindset. Feels like I'm learning how to be myself again. \n\nThis post made me tear up because I had been that snake for the longest time and how far I've come along since then. Recently I've been thinking about the little support I'd received along the way and wanting to let them know I'm finally ok now. \n\nAll this is to say I hear you, I've been where you are. And even though you may not believe it now, it will get better. Even if it takes a very long time and often feels like you make no progress, it's still there. \n\nYou don't need to be whole, just be ok. Function as best as your broken self. Work around things.
