            "body": "\nHello r/wholesomememes ! I am once again asking for your original wholesome memes!\n\nWhile we have been able to keep the bots away, we haven\u2019t had as many posts shared in our community recently. In September 2024 we began the requirement for posts to be original content (OC). In the past six months, we have had many users grace us with their sweet comics and memes. Thank you VERY MUCH for sharing your creativity and your uplifting insights!\n\nTo show a better appreciation for our creative friends, we will be holding a Wholesome Meme Contest from now until the end of March. The meme with the most upvotes before 12 AM UTC April 1st will determine the winner. We are looking into other ways to award users beyond a user flair, but for now the title of \ud83c\udd5c\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd62\ud83c\udd63\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udd66\ud83c\udd57\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd5b\ud83c\udd54\ud83c\udd62\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd5c\ud83c\udd54 will be the best we can bestow at this time. \n\nThe Moderators will also select a Mod\u2019s Choice winner as well.\n\nAs always, r/wholesomememes requires memes to be\n- A meme - An image or gif with text added. This can be a standard meme format, a comic, or a gif.\n- Original Content - You must be the one to create the meme. You can edit an existing meme template, add text to an image or video (overlayed or as a caption), or create something completely new like a comic.\n- Wholesome - Uplifting and/or motivational, positive, and life affirming.\n\nSome tips from the Mods:\n- Screenshots of social media are not memes. Even if it is wholesome OC, it will be removed.\n- If your post is just an image with no text included, it will be removed. Using the title for your text does not count. \n- No meta - No memes or titles referencing Reddit, r/wholesomememes, other subreddits, upvotes, or karma are allowed. This includes calling out spam, bots, or reposts - which is great, but not wholesome. \n- Avoid posts that might end up on r/thanksimcured or r/orphancrushingmachine\n- While we applaud your personal achievements, please note that we do not consider personal achievements, conversations, or milestones be a wholesome meme. Some examples of these would be the \u201cIt is with great pleasure that I inform you\u201d frog meme, screenshots of text messages, or using \u201csuccess kid\u201d to make an announcement.\n\nIf there is enough interest we can continue doing a monthly contest, add themes, and find ways to do good collectively.\n\nIf you have never made a meme before, we encourage you to ask questions in the comments of this post if you aren\u2019t sure how to start. Using a site like https://imgflip.com/memetemplates is an easy way to make a meme. We are also open to feedback or discussion about the future of our community.\n\nThank you everyone and good luck! \ud83c\udf40",
