My mom is prone to just cutting you off mid sentence if she doesn't engage with what you're saying, which was often when I as a neurodivergent kid would start talking about something she has no knowledge or interest in. But lately the same would sometimes happen to my nephew, so I try to reengage the conversation again later, or at least turn around to him and show that I'm still listening even if no one else is",
