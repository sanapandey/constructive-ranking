It\u2019s so amazing and supportive. There are a ton of adults that come in not being able to do a cartwheel that got just as much or more encouragement than the ones still doing advanced skills.",

Anytime I see an adult male who did gymnastics as a kid, I get so pissed because it was the only physical activity I really wanted to do.\n\nThere is definitely no adult gymnastics happening where I live, but even if there was, I am in no shape for any of it right now! It's nice to hear that I could find something some day though!",

I used to train at a school that ran ages 5-to-14 classes followed by 12-to-adult classes, followed by black belt-only classes (though you could stick around to learn and train some more as long as you didn't mind the teacher pretending you weren't there).\n\nI'm guessing this school has a special set of classes set aside for white belts, or possibly the first three grades. When you're at *that* low a level, as long as you're not performing applications or sparring, there's basically no difference what class you're in, age-wise.

That five year old girl, even once she earns her black belt, would get her rear end kicked by a full grown man in no time flat.\n\nMartial arts are a force multiplier, not an \"I win\" card.  \n\nKarate is great for fitness and recreation, but its not like Hollywood.  If you get jumped by more than one person, you're screwed.  If they're significantly bigger or heavier than you, you're screwed.  If they have any weapon, you're screwed if unarmed.  Effective self defense is knowing how to avoid/escape from threatening situations, not being able to wipe the floor with your attackers.  If you try to do so, the best case scenario in a real world situation is you'll end up in the ER.  \n\nI realize this is a bit off topic for this post, but I've heard people say \"my kid's a black belt; he'll be fine anywhere.\", and frankly, that's scary.  Last time I checked, there's no karate technique designed to handle being shot at.",
