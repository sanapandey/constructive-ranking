It takes a lot of work to not only help them not listen to the world's negativity about them but it's even more important to help shape their own self image and make them realize that their inner voice should be full of love and grace. We are all too hard on ourselves and I've seen the damage it causes full grown adults.",

I know if I did now I'd be a shit dad . I refuse to repeat the pattern. Plus I wanna adopt cus I have bad genetics (plus I might not be fertile) . Idk how old your kid/kids are but I'm sure some day they'll appreciate the effort you're putting in. So many people don't do that.",

However I do have a brother who's also on the spectrum who is a lot like the daughter it seems. The reason it's so important to support with something like this report card is because a lot of people on the spectrum have trouble seeing values of things in metaphors, like the inherent value of people. They base stuff off of what can be quantified, which at a young age tends to be grades. Also the issue could less be her not understanding the materials but more so having a different way of solving problems, it could be having trouble focusing or playing nice with kids depending on the age. Here's an example:\n\nI had a problem on a test that went like this, 453 + 679. Now we were supposed to line them up and then do carrying but the way I solved it was \n\n400 + 600 = 1000\n\n50 + 70 = 120\n\n9 + 3 = 12\n\n1000 + 120 + 12 = 1132\n\nI got no credit because I didn't use the teachers method. I also had trouble understanding how to play with the kids which at a very young age can make you lose credit. It's not that I'm not intelligent, I am by no means a genius but I'm currently predicted salutatorian and taking AP calc BC as a sophomore so I think I'm above average. It's just that elementary school is really geared against people on the spectrum with its reliance on root memoization, how to \"play nice\", it's constant ease (people on the spectrum and especially those who also have ADHD struggle in classes that are easy because they seem too boring), and oftentimes they have not developed how to mask and coping strategies.\n\nAnyways essay over now, I'm just saying that it might just be elementary School being very unaccommodating and not her lack of understanding. Of course it could be but I just wanted to bring up other options",

So it might be that D is genuinely quite good for them, if their Autism is a bit more severe.

That's personally something I've seen and experienced a lot where a question can have multiple different interpretations on what is being asked because of the assumed understood subtext.

You are judging a person with a disability without any perspective about the challenges they face.\n\nJust look at the responses you got and in this thread in general. Many of them have endless paragraphs and circular explanations nobody would read, but they still write it and never learn that nobody on the internet got time for it.

We should ALL want that, in addition to the report card he gave her.\n\nSo while I can understand that her condition might be affecting her grades, there are tons of kids going to school hungry, homeless, abused, neglected, bullied, etc & some of those kids have undiagnosed conditions that might affect their ability to learn, on top of those other things, but they still get better grades than her. \n\nThe other replies, gave insight.

For months, I was only allowed to clean, do homework, or study. He wouldn't even let me go to the library, go on family outings, watch tv or movies with them, or read for leisure (probably the worst part of all for me as reading was a huge form of escape from my abusive dad.) As a result of this, I read my school textbooks from cover to cover just to have something to do. This punishment only ended after he went 'too far' one of the times he was beating me and gave me a black eye. A teacher noticed and pulled me aside to ask about what happened, and I finally broke down. Lived with my mom for a few months before ultimately going back to living at his house.   \nAnyway, I hope that those with dads like this (or people who are dads like this) find $20 on the ground and never experience back pain.
