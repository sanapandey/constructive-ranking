I think the black sauce could be a clue, but not sure, maybe Oyster sauce? Not sure if that's for the fish or the ravioli or cheese lol",

Genuinely solid nutrition.\n\nFruit gives you some sugar to perk back up relatively quickly and some dietary fiber; the nuts give you a bit of healthy fat to burn later, a bit of protein, and some vitamins; and the sandwich, depending on what it is... Assuming meat, cheese, some condiments... So protein and fats, a bit of sugar.\n\nAll-around 10/10. Thoughtful lunch that is easy on the stomach even if you're in large amounts of pain or deathly nauseated. \n\nYour lady is, at the very least, caring, and it's touching that you appreciate her efforts the way you do. But don't be afraid to have preferences! You are allowed to not like things. Made that mistake plenty of times over the years...",

Women who are leading the same lives as men -- working full-time jobs, often with an additional \"side hustle\" to help out financially -- get understandably upset if they are then expected to carry the bulk of childcare, cooking, cleaning, planning, shopping, holidays, etc. We are all working with the same number of hours in a day, and the amount of downtime is a bucket of hours to be *shared.*\n\nIf a woman *wants* to make her husband a lunch, by all means! It's a sweet gesture. But if a guy is mad that his lunch wasn't made for him when he is perfectly capable of figuring out his own meals to eat at work, it becomes shitty. Again, barring previous agreement, he should be willing and able to handle his own physical maintenance. It's really not rocket science.\n\nB) Who the fuck says \"femcels\"?",

Labor can be divided however makes sense to both people involved. I assume you and your wife decided who was going to do what ahead of time so things feel fair to both people.\n\nI only get upset when people (like the one I replied to who tends to spout a bunch of anti-feminist nonsense) get *mad* that they didn't come home to a hot dinner or have their lunch packed for them like they're a kindergartener when that was never discussed as part of the division of labor.

You might think 'Bro, why are you letting her take advantage of you this way?' and another girl chimes in saying 'This criticism is hilarious.

And ironically a lot of woman do very much make that argument anyway, many women on twitter flex getting guys they're not interested in to send them money and when man comment about it its always \"you're just jealous and broke\" \"why do you care it's not your money\" \"you wouldn't understand, men of means like spending money to spend it\". So this argument is already made by woman. \n\n\"The point is, sure, she might enjoy it.

My girlfriend (ex now) came to watch and then after the parade everyone from the army plus their girlfriends and some family came to the regiment bar. There was a long table I sat down with a bunch of my friends and their +1s. That's when my girlfriend whipped out my favourite sandwich she used to make for me which was insanely good. It had everything in it and I just don't know how she got it so perfectly toasted and all the most delicious ingredients. It even had a little toothpick with an olive on it. Anyway, I opened this and I could see all my army friends looking like deer in the headlights at it. The one across from me glanced at his girlfriend and I heard her mumble distinctively, \"don't even think about it.\" And in that moment I was just extremely grateful for my girlfriend. It was so weird to me how some girls actively fight to do less for their significant others.\n\nIt's amazing how this girl was able to intuit everything I wanted. She was so attuned it was very touching. We ended up long distance and she ended up in some weird situation having sex with a guy and there was cocaine involved or something. Couldn't deal with it in the end and had to break it off. Really liked her though.",

            "body": "When I moved in with my now husband, about 14.5 years ago I was stronger and fitter and I cooked every day. He worked nightshift and went to work with a proper meal inside him and good packed sandwiches etc for his 'lunch'. In his words he'd \"never been so well looked after in his whole life\", I made sure he got proper sleep and rested and recovered on the weekends, because nights Monday to Friday then two days off really messed with his sleep.\n\nI enjoyed cooking and baking for him, watching him try something completely new was always interesting. No matter what I made he ate it, he doesn't like couscous, but I had no chicken stock left and the shop stuff was bland, but he ate it - because I cooked it for him. He worked much harder and more hours than I did, so looking after him a bit, pampering him, was the right thing to do in my mind",
