In the first year i did chemistry, amongst others, and in the beginning i was really struggling, and got a 2.9/10 for the first test (you need a 5.5 to pass) and a 4.9 for the second one. Then studied my ass off and got a 7.8 for the third one, and i remember the first lesson after, my teacher walking up to me with a very serious look, he was a slightly grumpy, but very nice man, and putting a firm hand on my shoulder and just saying \"well done\".

At the time, my draft was only ~20 pages long. They finished in 15 minutes.\n\nSkeptical, I quizzed their retention and reading comprehension; they passed, and then they asked if there was more. I told them to give me a few days to write up more. Their complements and genuine interest in my writing motivated me to follow a passion further than any teacher, friend, or partner I had at the time. Soon, my draft of 20 pages became 500 pages within 6-7 months. It was a motivational high that I haven't had in a long time, and I'm always on the chase for it.\n\nMy student's became my muse, and even though their pronouns have changed; I will always remember them as my emo/goth student lost in the infinite universes and being spirited away with each page turned. We still chat on occasion 10+ years later, and I always remind them how they changed my life and unlocked a new passion I never knew I had or knew I was capable of.\n\n[And to be clear, my major was focused on teacher rather than writing, which is why I consider myself self-taught only because writing wasn't my goal in university].",

A friend came up to me asking how I felt walking by \"that.\" I had no clue what they were talking about since I genuinely could not think of anything noteworthy. \n\nTurns out they were talking about some conjoined twins that were walking about, and they were stunned that I didn't notice them. The thing was I *did* notice them, but I really didn't see them any different from any other stranger I was walking past, so it didn't really stick in my mind.\n\nI think he was just really appreciative of how I seemed to not care about those kind of differences in people. So he voiced it in your typical \"edgy is cool\" middleschool way.  It was an odd way to complement someone so it became a memorable moment for me.

            "body": "\"You're doing a FANTASTIC job mom =)\"\n\nI had my son - who was about 4-5 at the time - and was waiting for my oldest to get out of a rec gym class.  He has always been the kind of kid that wants to be fully automous immediately, rules or consequences be damned. That particular day, I was super tired. I don't remember any specifics, but I remember feeling at the end of my rope.  He was testing boundaries, and I was talking to him about his behavior (I think he was trying to play tag with another kid in a busy lobby full of moms and kids of various ages). A woman I'd seen in the lobby a few times handed me a note (that I keep in my desk) with this message as she left.  I never saw her again. I was unable to look at it until later as my oldest came out of class and we needed to leave, but when I did, I just broke down and cried. Every now and then, I find the note again and remember her kindness.",
