Because their ancestors were delusional?\n\ni mean, this can be used to describe most rich people and families with inherited wealth.\n\nif it's the wealth you're against then thats okay, but it aint exclusive to the royals. \n\nif its power you're against then most royals (especially in scandinavia) don't hold that much if any political power.\n\nnow monarchy aint that good sure, but its much better than it was in the past. And removing a massive tradition and norm, especially when most of the people don't mind it isn't really the best option for a country.\n\n\"down with the monarchies\" might sound pretty damn good in theory, but in practice its much much much much more complicated.",
