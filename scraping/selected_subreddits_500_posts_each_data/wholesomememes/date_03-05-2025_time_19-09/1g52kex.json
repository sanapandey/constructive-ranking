Listen imma be a little scared of a person who calls themselves penis devourer and their family too.\n\n  \nJokes aside yeah a lot of men dont know how to handle kindness because the world isnt exactly kind to us. So it becomes sensory overload and makes us exceptionally uncomfortable. Having your guard up all the time is exhausting, but it's a lot easier than constantly raising and lowering it. So we take what we love and put it in a walled garden. \"Just ...stay over on that side of the garden so im not distracted by how wonderful you are\".",

He\u2019s just soooooo deserving of love and kindness and my mom saw that the first time I brought him over too so we just wanna spoil him but I\u2019m gonna let my mom know to tone it down a bit. She owns her own company and makes good money so when we have family outings it\u2019s always letting us loose in the mall getting whatever we want. We were really poor growing up and she\u2019s always felt guilty about not being able to provide for us and turning to an abusive relationship in order to keep us fed. She just loves hard lol.",

It took me nearly 30 years now to feel like im ready to really be in love with someone.\n\nas a man if you dont mind i'll give some advice.\n\n- if he cant communicate that he needs space properly than he doesnt need space he needs love (it's confusing but you likely know what i mean). e.g. he's frustrated about something but cant quite express it. a hug and a heartbeat go a very very long way. a heartbeat literally one of the most soothing things in the world to everyone, so bury his head in your arms and suffocate his face\n\n- if he can in any situation communicate he needs space it means he does need space. e.g. you're arguing or he's mad about something or sad about something and he says \"can you give me a minute/space/some time\" than back up and wait a couple hours and then ask if he wants to talk. Sometimes people who go through abuse struggle with thought organization and they just need time to process things.\n\n-  birthdays, Christmas, family outings will always be a little stressful for him when he's there because he will feel like he doesnt belong and like he's intruding. Invite him to every single one. if they're important to you drag him to them if you have to but understand that it's a mixed bag of emotions. Speaking from experience i cant remember the faces of the women i dated who always left me alone on those days but every single woman who drug me to their family events i can remember every single one of their family members names and what we did every single hour of that day.\n\n- celebrate his birthday, but let it be a subtle thing. a card goes much much farther than some extravagant gift. gifts are appreciated ofc but most people who suffer abuse try to take up as little space as possible meaning they rarely express what they want so be prepared for difficulty there. i can promise you the very basic gift of \"socks\" intended as a totally benign and \"normal\" gift is a lot funnier and memorable than say a game would be.\n\n- and if he's a handsy/active person, never let him be idle for to long. like LITERALLY drag him  out of bed if you have to. Put purpose in his hands and make him do things. If he's more of a reader/mental thinker type than pick his brain, ALL the time, especially if topics interest you guys both.\n\nPhysical health and mental health go hand in hand, but people who suffer abuse usually gives up on one or the other which then affects the other. Even something as simple as a walk and talk can be exceptionally stabilizing for most people.\n\n  \nMuch love, im rooting for you guys :)",
