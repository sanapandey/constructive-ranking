I fried my share of components when I first started. All that matters is that you remember what you did and how you fixed the problem. That is the key to becoming a great tech. \" \n\nThat's what he told me, and I want to also let you know that being in a previous toxic environment can affect you, but don't bring that mentality when you are on your current job",

It feels like a lot of pressure because I really want to leave a good impression and hopefully work with/at this company once I finish my degree. On the other hand, the main reason I was able to write a good application, despite my self-doubt at every stage of the process, was because at their \"employers on campus\" presentation, they acknowledged that a lot of applicants wouldn't get it but still seemed really friendly and encouraging. So if they were able to spark some confidence before I've even stepped in the building, then I think it should be a good place to work.",
