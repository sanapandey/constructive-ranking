I see where maybe it might be bc the guy agreed to a labrous task for a stranger - but I\u2019m fairly certain the point is that the painter is better at painting just like the selfie person is better at taking selfies.   \n \n I think the joke is that if you give your camera to a passerby, it is likely that you will receive pics back that don\u2019t look good to you, the same as the artist in the picture is about to receive something that he wouldn\u2019t really call \u201cart\u201d.",

Kinda like when beginner artists do fan art and experienced artists are proud. I mean you can tell that the person in the last picture is trying hard",
