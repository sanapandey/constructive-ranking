Sometimes not even that, when the clouds come, you just have to know it's there. \n\nIt can be the sound of trumpets and horns heralding reinforcements, the thunder of battle as your unlooked for allies ride to the rescue. Loud, brash, impossible to ignore, sweeping aside everything that stands between you and something better. \n\nIt can be a breeze. Quiet. Invisible, barely felt, but it brushes aside the miasma that's been following you, letting you breathe again. Only for it to come back worse than before as the wind shifts. \n\nIt can be a moment of silence, so easily shattered when the yelling starts again. \n\nIt can be all those, and more. \n\nHope doesn't get you back up.\nIt isn't even why you get back up.\nIt just shows you that you can.",
