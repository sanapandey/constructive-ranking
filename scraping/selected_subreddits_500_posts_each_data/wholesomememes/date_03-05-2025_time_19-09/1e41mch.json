That they\u2019ve never put their arm around a date like on the couch or at a movie and they get all snuggly and then eventually all the blood drains from your arm and the pain sets in in your arm. \n\n[I found it](https://youtu.be/NW3eBq4_qPA?si=Z-iHjqDV_BO3MiuK)\n\nIn hindsight the joke wasn\u2019t quite as funny as I remembered. It\u2019s been a long time since I had heard it. But he made the joke back in 1963.",
