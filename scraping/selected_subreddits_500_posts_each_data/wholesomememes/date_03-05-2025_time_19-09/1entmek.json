Beautiful place, beautiful people - highly recommend going there. \n\nI think my daughter appreciated seeing rides operated by other people in a wheelchair as much as anything.",

I have crutches and use a wheelchair sometimes but I was a huge theme park junkie before I became disabled. I can\u2019t do as much at normal parks now, but I\u2019d love to see a park that\u2019s safe for me! I\u2019d have no problems baying for admission, just curious if attractions are mostly kid sized",
