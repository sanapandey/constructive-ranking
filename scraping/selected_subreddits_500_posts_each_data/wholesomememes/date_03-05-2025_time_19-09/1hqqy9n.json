But once I was able to get myself back up, I felt less weight on my shoulders.\n\n\nI know she'd be glad for that as well, she always hated me waiting on her and doing things for her.

I\u2019m more annoyed than mad. But the week prior to my bday is Valentine\u2019s Day, and the week later is my friend\u2019s birthday party. He\u2019s turning 21, so I don\u2019t want to host a last party near his. I hope the rest of the year won\u2019t go like this, but it feels like it will.",
