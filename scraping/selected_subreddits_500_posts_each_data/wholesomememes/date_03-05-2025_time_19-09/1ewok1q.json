They\u2019ll talk to them out loud. Yes, it will look like they\u2019re talking to thin air because the one who has passed is no longer physically in this dimension. It\u2019s a part of the ongoing grieving process and a healthy part of the grieving process, ESPECIALLY if the one left behind has some form of regret or any sort of unreconciled issue. Sometimes though, it\u2019s simply because we miss that person and HOPE they can hear or feel us. It\u2019s all about energy, my friend.",
