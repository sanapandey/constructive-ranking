Because children don\u2019t have a fully developed brain to truly understand the depths of their emotions (none of us do tbh) and yet here they are showing up for their friends and even strangers. It\u2019s such a beautiful thing to know kids are inherently kind. It\u2019s society that sadly ruins things for them",
