If you're anything like me, it might feel a little cringe but you gotta push through the cringe. You might chose to write it down instead of saying it to yourself to see if that helps.\n\nI also found it useful to question my thoughts more as in \"hey where did that come from?\" \"does it help me to think that way?\" and if the answer was no, that'd shut up my brain pretty quick if you're a reasoning/logic over emotion person.\n\nedit: Can't believe I forgot my most favourite thing that helped me rewire my relationship with myself. This might be a more emotion based one as you gotta treat yourself as a friend/loved one/a child. Everytime I said something bad, I would ask myself is that something I'd say to a friend. \n\nThis also helps with guilt, like I wouldn't shame a friend for binging after a bad day, so why do that to myself? At best I would suggest my friend gently to look for better coping mechanisms so that's what I would do for myself too.",
