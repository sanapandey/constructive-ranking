It's just I'm used to forcing myself to do it to make others feel comfortable. I have felt genuine sadness for loss, but then I'm unable to cry as well.\n\nI tend express my feelings in other ways... Such as literally talking about where people give me the space, or through actions, though mostly, I keep to myself because people assume stuff, and this has affected my social life to no end.\n\nRegardless my only advise to you, is to not judge people right off the bat. Give them some time, understand them, and even then, no point judging a person, because what you know of them, is what they choose to show you, based on how you interact with them.",

I mostly keep to myself and don't bother people irl. And online, since I'm enjoy writing short stories and stuff I converse with people and express my opinions when and where I can. Some turn out bitter, because I'm straightforward, though my intent isn't to cause hurt. \n\nI know I make people uncomfortable so I keep to a few friends and they don't mind me. Otherwise, if people don't want to talk, I give them the space and distance myself as well... Most of the people who studied with me or grew up with me, don't even know whether I'm alive or dead at this point xD\n\nAll said and done, I have my coping mechanisms, I'm placed well in life and I fill in any void with hobbies and activities. And I get to pet dogs everywhere I go, and they don't seem to mind my company. Animals in general are friendly with me. So I'm not really alone or in a bad place. \n\nBut regardless, I'm extremely grateful for your concern. You have a great day ahead!",
