Just thinking about it now brings up those same feelings. But when I expressed my issues with the birds (for litteral years), I'd always get the same couple replies: \"It doesn't sound that bad, it sounds kinda funny imo\", \"oh it doesn't happen that often\", \"once they start screeching, it's always over pretty quickly\", \"if you hate the sound that much just put in airpods or go sit somewhere else\". \n\nLuckily I live with my mom for a while now (the inconsistency of going to the other parent every week drove me crazy too, among some other things at my dad's house). And I'm working towards moving out of the house soon.\n\nI don't take medications for my ADHD (I've tried some myself and I've talked to a LOT of people and in my opinion and for my preferences medication doesn't seem to be a solution). I also think that ADHD (and possibly autism) are my personal super powers, although they do come with immense challenges.\n\nBit of a long rant, but I'm not sure whether I want to try to get diagnosed for autism since it might help me understand myself better. But every time I've brought it up to a general practitioner or someone else they always say I 'talk to easily to be autistic', and as far as the other traits it's: 'well yeah but everyone is a bit autistic'.",

It's stressful having so much broken, but I learned to get past that because my kid feels like absolute shit after these episodes, and shaming or losing my temper on them would only make them feel worse and cause it to happen more frequently. So I watch tv in my room with the volume down or on my phone. My kid matters more to me than objects or money. \n\nMost doctors don't really understand autism or ADHD. You need a psychologist who specializes in autism/adhd. They will understand. And, honestly, you don't need an official diagnosis unless it's to qualify for disability benefits or special education services or ADA protections at work. \n\nI just stopped taking ADHD meds, myself. I have nothing against them, but the side effects got bad for me. I find going to the gym regularly or doing yoga helps me far more, without the negative side effects. \n\nIt's nice that you can stay with your mom until you get your own place.

Reading your comment, I think it's really commendable (and strong) how you chose to react and accept it.\n\nI tried to get in contact with a specialist through the general practitioner, but unfortunately, I really couldn't get anywhere with her.\n\nI do have my struggles in the workplace. I've worked as an account manager and assortiment manager for some e-commerce companies in the Netherlands. But people being hypocritical really depletes my battery, and as soon as I have to do something I'm morally against (for example vaguely explaining how payment works to a small affiliate of ours so he might not know how to get paid) just destroys my ability to do anything else for them. Maybe this doesn't sound as something that bad since it's technically the responsibility of the affiliate himself, but we made fucking deal with him so honor it.\n\nI could go on another rant about this but in short, I just struggle tolerating dishonesty. And I feel like that's everywhere in the corporate world.\n\nCompany problems aside, I myself struggle a lot with tasks that I don't find meaningful or intriguing. Making it feel like those simple easy tasks cost 10x more energy than the interesting difficult one. Which is what I mostly seeked out help for (and some assistance in managing burn-out, since the above mentioned company took quite a toll on me).\n\nI always want to keep learning so I mostly just try to do my own research about myself and ADHD since I don't feel like I can get it from a 'professional' place. (At least for now, I am looking at maybe trying coaching / therapy from an online therapist called Dr. K / healthygamer.gg)\n\nAs said I now live with my mom which only became definitive literally 3 days ago, which is a great development, and for which I'm immensely grateful. It's been about a year since the slight burn-out but things finally (slowly) start to allign for the better. So I hope I'm able to get my own place soon and I'm curious how life will look for me then.\n\nAlso sorry for the long, unorganized rant lol.

You won't hear me complain! \ud83d\ude05\n\nWhen my kid was much younger I took a class on parenting behaviorally challenging children and nearly burst into tears when the instructor (who developed the class b/c of her own personal experiences), told us, \"If your child had a broken leg, you wouldn't get tell them to run or get angry at them because they can't run.\" She also explained that when ANYONE'S brain is dysregulated, the amygdala shuts down, and that is why children can't learn while they are in the midst of a meltdown or an anxiety attack. It's like they go into survival mode to protect themselves. And that is where the broken leg comparison came in. Why would try to threaten, shame, blame or punish a child for becoming dysregulated, however that shows up for them? It's a reaction that they have no control over. Ir it's a reaction that they don't YET have the skills to control. She taught us that it's our job to maintain control of ourselves so that our kid can calm down more quickly, and it's our job to teach them emotional regulation and the other skills that they need to be successful. \n\nIt was still SO hard for me for a long time because either I got angry about the cost and wanted to just REACT or I empathized too much and just got emotional and/or scared. I had to learn to detach myself from the emotions and the outcome and just think about being there for my kid. It took a while. But it changed my life and my kid's life. \n\nAnd I totally get the ethical aspect of your job. I had a job that was adjacent to the financial industry, and I still had a twitch in my eye over a month after I quit. The borderline ethics was too much for me!

The sounds that are generally triggering are often noises people make without thinking about them. Chewing sounds when you're eating, the sound you make when you breath. Stuff like that. From the researchers I've heard talk about it, it often traces back to the idea of personal space and respect. People with Misophonia are often hyper aware of the noises they make and do everything they can to mitigate them, so when other people make those triggering sounds, it feels like it's on purpose and a direct attack on them. One thing that has helped people with this condition is just the awareness that other people aren't doing it to them, they're doing it unconsciously. I don't know if the sensitivity stemming from autism is similar at all, but given the examples that some people get a pass, it seems like it might be.\n\nedit: This was the show I initially listened to on the topic if anyone else wants to check it out for more info. https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/misophonia",

It's just my brains stupid way of reacting to those noises. \n\nAlso, it's got to be tied more to adhd than autism. Im diagnosed adhd, havent been tested for the tism, though, but im probably on the spectrum as many people with adhd tend to be. My misophonia is no longer an issue when im on my medication. Like it's night and day. I can hear all the loud chewing and mouth noises, and i no longer get that visceral feeling of pure rage when i hear those noises. Like ive made a scene at family dinners in the past. Just imagine a room of 30 italians chewing in silence and then me just suddenly and randomly throwing my fork and knife down and rushing off. Like pure unhinged behavior, vyvanse is such a game changer its actually insane.",

Low fat autism?\n\n Like yeah, high functioning autistic if anything. So yeah im just saying with how stimulants work in treating adhd and my misophonia not being an issue (unless youre eating while your mic is hot, fuck you if you do this) while on my vyvanse. \n\nThis being my experience would lead me to believe that misophonia is more tied into adhd than autism. Honestly, kids and dogs don't trigger it for me. In fact, i adore hearing my dogs chew food and lap up water.

It's not a bold claim to say they are or aren't Autistic. What I think is wild is that you're willing to accept the video at face value but not its critics. \n\nIf I tell you I'm Tom Hanks and you said no you're not, it would be weird for me to demand proof that I'm not. I should have to prove I am if its an issue. That's why IDs exist. OP made the claim that this person is Autistic and if the burden of proof is on anyone, it's on the person making the claim, not the person disputing it. Ultimately though, it's a video on reddit and no one needs to prove anything. Enjoy it or don't. But don't act like people who aren't enjoying the video need proof to validate why they don't enjoy the video.",

I love concerts and going to the range so it isn't volume for me. Actually quieter sounds can be the most irritating. \n\nBut yeah, doesn't make a lot of sense to me either. I'm perfectly content with 150dB (with ear pro of course) but the sound of silverware scraping teeth makes me want to jam a fork in my ear so I never have to hear it again.",
