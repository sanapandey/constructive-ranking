            "body": "In 2004, after the Indian Ocean tsunami, a young hippo named Owen separated from his herd and became stranded off the coast of Kenya. Rescuers took him to Haller Park, a wildlife sanctuary, where he met Mzee, a 130-year-old Aldabra tortoise.\nIn his solitude, Owen began to follow Mzee everywhere as if he was his mother. Probably, he mistook her for another hippo, seeking comfort and protection. Over time, the unusual pair developed a strong bond, defying barriers between species.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/tortoise-hippo-friendship-deepens-post-tsunami-idUSN28296637/",
