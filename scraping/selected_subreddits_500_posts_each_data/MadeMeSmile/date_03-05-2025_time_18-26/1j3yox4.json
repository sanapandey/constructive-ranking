That doesn\u2019t mean you have to believe in the afterlife, or that \u201cgod\u201d has to take the shape of Judeo-Christian cosmology.  \n\nHumans are emotional beings, we experience the world emotionally and only after-the-fact do we rationalize our actions and frame our behavior within a narrative of self justification. If we\u2019re honest with ourselves, and interrogate and criticize our actions and beliefs ruthlessly *with other people*, only then can we take self-conscious control of our minds and bodies and *choose* our own god. Whatever that is. But everyone has a god, something they are emotionally invested in and that motivates them and frames their behavior. \n\nMost people in America worship the market, or money, or themselves through the market. The symbols of Christianity are just window dressing, it\u2019s almost all Calvinist predetermination and self-worship.",

                                            "body": "It's important to remember the distinction between intent and reception. If you say something that offends me, it isn't necessarily valid for me to assume you *intended* to offend me. Certainly that *could* be the case, and is the case sometimes, but there's a lot of value in being able to separate your reaction to something from the intent behind it. I think a lot of conflict - in all arenas of life - stems from peoples' failure to distinguish between their reaction to something, and a potentially-different intent. For example, it's not uncommon to hear overweight people complain about a doctor calling them overweight. They will often say things like \"the doctor shamed me for being fat!\" But the reality is that, while they may have *felt shamed*, the doctor was never bringing it up with the intent or purpose of shaming them - they were bringing it up because it's relevant to the patient's health, which is the doctor's job to assess and discuss.\n\nWhen you say something is \"mocking you,\" and done out of hate, that is making a statement about intent - something that you often aren't in a position to accurately assess. That is saying that the thing was done maliciously. That's often not a sound assumption. Do you genuinely believe that some kindergarten teacher somewhere must have hateful feelings toward Native Americans, and must be intentionally mocking you, based on nothing but having some little kids dress up a certain way, which seems to be a pretty standard way to get little kids engaged with what they're learning about?\n\nIf it came off to you as mocking, that's certainly worth pointing out so that your feelings can be considered and respected, but that can be done in a less accusatory way that acknowledges that maybe it wasn't *meant* to be mocking and leaves room for a less confrontational and more cooperative resolution. When you immediately accuse someone of ill intent based on nothing but your own negative reaction, that just turns it into a confrontation and puts them in a defensive mode where they now feel pressured to \"win the argument\" because you've already put their character on the line.\n\nJust food for thought!",

Or the aforementioned Vikings their dress and ceremonial garb is often portrayed in cartoonish and silly ways or on costumes, but then they are treated as honorable warriors in most more serious media. St Patrick's day they dress in gaudy green outfits with top hats and get drunk then talk about Ireland as if it is a magical place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey may wear a traditional war bonnet or a ceremonial dress and whoop or do a 'rain dance' but then they will regularly portray as noble, strong, wise etc. and everyone knows that white person who will tell you with great pride and glee that they are 1/16th Cherokee etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI roll my eyes at it, and think it is silly, but I don't anger over it at all. I don't find it malicious, just white people doing silly white people things.\nOf course, I do understand why it would lead some to anger, and don't fault their concerns at all. If I were to feel something was being done out of hate I would not hold my tongue, so I am glad others that feel differently than me are calling it out and are heard.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Ofc, the video is still cute.\n\nThis was my main take away from this video, I just want to give that child every hug.

As someone who has lived inside of the United States, but also internationally for most of my life, I understand \"both sides\". \n\nThe United States (and honestly Canada too, but they always dodge bullets in this topic) has a very deep seeded history with bigotry towards \"out\" groups, especially of different race, ethnic, and/or religious backgrounds. \n\nThat history is rough. It's not even funny how poor these people were treated. For example, in this video you have little toddlers and essentially babies dressed in what people think native American Indian culture *looks* like-- which therein lies the problem. It's a caricature. Native people are so expansive in ethnicities, that this is just an amalgamation of what people think they look like. Feather, some dainty hand prints, loin clothes, etc. Sure, they're probably teaching the kids about the holiday for Thanksgiving-- when the European Pilgrims and local Natives sat down for dinner... however, that history in itself is sugarcoated to shit. Those natives would eventually be killed, raped, displaced-- all lies in the actual physical evident genocide of a whole group of millions of peoples. \n\nAnd that's the issue-- there's still American Indians today. They have their culture, their languages, in fact in some places their own regulatory and government (look into Native Reservations for a roller-coaster of emotions). I understand being hurt seeing the caricature depiction of your culture being used to teach a very untrue version of horrible events. And likewise for the Chinese in the United States during the 1800s. They were run out of town, shot at, humiliated-- all while they came to build a freaking railroad for essentially indentured servitude. And Chinese people still exist today. \n\nImagine trying to teach the Holocaust by putting little toddlers into striped pajamas. People unanimously would say that's insensitive. Sure, maybe you're *trying* to teach about the Jewish plight and suffering... but still isn't the best way to teach because, well, Jews still exist today. They're still a group of people. And they're a group of people that can be hurt by that. And there *are* ways to teach little kids about tragedies like the Holocaust without turning it into a silly game.\n\nIn your example, dressing up as Victorians, isn't an issue. Firstly, because Victorians don't exist today. No one will be offended if you dress up in a big skirt or a top hat. Even if you want to be dark, no one will be upset at you for depicting a soot-covered child worker for that part, because there's no longer any soot-covered Victorian children. However, secondly, Victorian attire and mannerisms aren't technically tied to an oppressed ethnic group. Replace making fun of a Victorian's literacy and replace \"Victorian\" with \"African Immigrant\", and now you're not poking fun of historical lower-class literacy during the 1800s, but now making fun of an African Immigrant. And if your intention is to address the *current* issue of low literacy of immigrants from Africa, there are **way** better ways to do that than making a caricature. \n\nI guess that's kind of the way that I see it. It's not that playing dress up is bad to teach little kids ideas. However, it's when you dress up as affected groups and demographics that still to this day exist. And you can't say it's out of appreciation, because you're doing what *you* think (in this case, what *you* think an American Native would be wearing). I have no issue with white people dressing in traditional clothing... just make sure you're doing it from an appreciation stand view. Learn about other cultures, don't learn your own way of their cultures. (And as a note, when I say \"you\", I'm not referring to specifically you.).",

The sacred culture that was ripped from our hands by boarding schools and prejudice and murder and a society that was set up to specifically exclude us? Tell me, of the 547 current tribes in the US, which of their cultures is this a caricature of? Well, you probably can't tell me because they've been stereotyped to death and re-constructed in the present day as an ancient monolith.\n\nParts of our culture are gatekept on purpose, because it is only meant for us. Because it was violently stripped from our children for generations, willfully, on purpose, at the hands of the feds and the church. \n\n\"The only way you need to worry about your culture falling is if your people stop practising it.\" - Yeah, this is exactly what the federal government intended with the campaign to \"kill the indian, save the man\" - hundreds of cultures were lost forever because of colonization here. You know it was only legal for Native Americans to practice their religion in 1978? My father was 13. And Native Americans didn't gain citizenship until 1921? My great grandfather was born that year, on a reservation, as a tribal citizen only. The cultural genocide isn't even over. The imagery we see in this video is the end-stages, where everybody kinda forgets what really happened and they go along in their little paper costumes. All while native women go missing at a much higher rate than other demographics in the US. \n\nBut yeah, Halloween and Samhain is basically the same exact thing and a parallel can be easily drawn with zero nuance. /s",

That's the risk of sharing cultures and living in a multicultural world.

I'm tired of seeing people dressed up as sexy nuns or drag nuns or weed nuns when I've personally spent time in a convent with real nuns who would be mortified to see how their traditional clothing and lifestyle is mocked around Halloween or other times. On that note, I hate that performance artists in my city have appropriated All Souls Day and made up a Carnival-level parade and fabricated ceremonies about vague notions of loss in general like \"letting go of bad vibes\" instead of what it really is - a day to pray for the souls of the faithful departed in Purgatory to relieve then of their temporal suffering. But I'm just being an uptight conservative when I see people taking *my culture* - yes, Catholicism is a Culture, that's why *cult* is the root of that word...can't have culture without religion, only anti-culture - and turning it into a costume or a theme for their drunken antics or a way for them to express their rebellious nature. It's wrong when they do it to us, it's wrong when they do it to you. People just don't like admitting they're doing something wrong when everyone doing the wrong thing is having fun.

I can say it is not out of spite at all. Most my life has been around other natives and a lot of them take certain things way to far to the point of reason as to why I can see why some people call us savages. \n\nGetting stuck in even the recent past is only going to continue to hurt us natives. We lost a lot, and continued to lose a lot even up until recent times. However our culture continues to die, if it werent for the colonization we natives would most certainly already be wiped out one way or another. Especially with the way the world was advancing. To many natives see the old ways as the right ways when that is continue cause for extinction. From what Ive noticed the tribes that do pursue growth are the ones that are succeeding the most. Instead we got uncle bubba drinking a 40 pack on the daily or aunty steph smoking 4 blunts a day complaining how she got the short end of the stick.\n\nIf we continue to shut out our culture from even mainstream media or simple classroom arts and crafts we are going to drop dead. Our languages are already nearing extinction because of two reasons, the past and the current generations not willing to even learn or care about it. I think something a lot of us natives and many other cultural groups need to learn how to share and spread the love of our culture. OH AND MOTHER FREAKING FRY BREAD IS NOT APART OF OUR CULTURE! It is what scraps we were able to scrape together after being congregated into our reservations. \n\n\n\nAnyways, culture is never one sided. Some of the greatest experiences are when multiple cultures, ethnicities, heritages come together and enjoy their time.  We must let live with what happened because there is no changing it. And it is not the white peoples fault as those white people are now dead. So stop being racist to our fellow members of life.",
