Please remember that r/Socialism is a subreddit for socialists and, as such, participation must consist of conscious anti-capitalist analysis - this is not the place to promote non-socialist narratives but rather to promote critical thought from within the anti-capitalist left. Critques are expected to be high quality and address the substance of the issue; ad hominems, unconstructive sectarianism, and other types of lazy commentary are not acceptable.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a complex topic about which there may be many different points of view. Before making an inflamatory comment, consider asking the other user to explain their perspective, and then discuss why specifically you disagree with it.\n   \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's a progressive liberal but has deep connections with China and is insistent on having in-depth and nuanced discussions about China, and brings on a variety of guests including Chinese officials. \n\nI also like the \"China in Africa\" podcast, which focuses on China-Africa relations, mostly from a trade/development perspective. Its also mostly liberal in ideology, but similar to \"Sinica Podcast\", they're serious intellectuals and reporters and are insistent on bucking the propaganda BS that has come to dominant mainstream Western rhetoric about China. \n\nIts an interesting time, because for serious liberal scholars and journalists who are genuinely interested in China, even if they're critical of this or that aspect of China, they're also utterly repulsed by the jingoism that has taken over the West and spend a lot of time debunking myths and propaganda.",
