Social democrats originally wanted to achieve socialism through reform rather than revolution, while communists believed only revolution could bring change since the capitalist class and system would prevent any systemic reform. Socialist revolutions occurred in places like Tsarist Russia, where reform seemed impossible, while in countries with some democratic openings, reformist socialism gained more traction. Today, the Swedish \u2019Social Democrats\u2019 party have abandoned its roots and embraced a centrist, capitalist-friendly approach, rather cooperating with the economically far right \u2019Center Party\u2019 than the more socialist V\u00e4nsterpartiet. In some ways V\u00e4nsterpartiet has become a dumping ground for the \u2019Social Democrats\u2019; a place to keep troublesome socialists sandboxed. Not giving them real political influence, while they still can count on their votes in parliament.",

Does not refer to the social democratic tradition (e.g. Rosa Luxemburg) that was represented by the 2nd International, prior to its break with socialism in favor of the European idea of the welfare state (capitalism). Modern Scandinavia is an example of social democracy.\n\nFeel free to send us a modmail with a link to your removed submission if you have any further questions or concerns.",
