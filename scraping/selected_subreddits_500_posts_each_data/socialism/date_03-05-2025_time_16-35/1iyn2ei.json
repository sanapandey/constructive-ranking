    "selftext": "Folks, as someone who has read quite a bit of Marxist/socialist literature and teaches labor history at University, I find myself in an interesting place that feels beyond the \"101\" sub. \n\nI'm a local government official in the US. I could write essays about the complexities of what that means and how often our hands are tied to *not* practice socialism in our roles. This is somewhat related. We have an upcoming review of a city employee and our board has been asked to develop our process. While I've studied labor organizing, led union campaigns, and been involved in this from various angles, I have yet to sit at this end. \n\nHow do you think through performance reviews and expectations of employees from a manager perspective? Any suggested best practices? How do you balance a sense of solidarity with \"subordinate\" workers as this system lays out?\n\nI'm both trying to keep my position and the employee's a bit vague but these sorts of things range from oversee a local police force, to budget, to office staff, to public workers and more. While this is specifically a government and in-office question, I do welcome responses to general \"management\" practices in such a place.\n\nRecommended readings are also welcome.\n\nIn form of larger discourse, there's a lot to question about what jobs and roles we fill and how we perpetuate the systems of capitalist oppression (wittingly or not....)",

Are you the sole decision maker, or are there others in the room with equal say, and how will their political values factor into the collective decision-making process?\n\nWhat material effects can be expected to follow from the creation of this review process? How will it affect the overall ideological attitude of the city government as an institution? How will it affect the day to day operation of governmental functions? What kind of employee conduct/performance should fall on the favorable side of the review, and what kind should fall on the unfavorable side?\n\nGiven the answers to these questions, how can you as an individual affect this process to best promote the interests of the working class in your city? What kind of review process do you imagine in a socialist world, and where is the acheivable middle ground between that vision and the system that exists currently?",
