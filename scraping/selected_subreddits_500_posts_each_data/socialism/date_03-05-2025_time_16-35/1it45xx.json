I've done some research and there aren't really any groups to get involved in here except for small political parties. Are there any online communities I can join that do similar things? I'm hoping there's a reading group that meets on zoom or teams or something weekly. Anything other than scrolling through reddit really lol",

            "body": "I'm not very familiar with reading groups myself, so apologies ahead of time on how useful this will be! \n\nLocal libraries often have book clubs, though if they are online or in-person seems to depend on the library. Book review and book catalogue websites sometimes have forums for discussion, too. \n\nThere are websites like [bookclubs.com](http://bookclubs.com) though I do not know how friendly the site is to discussion of socialism. Discord, similarly, has various servers dedicated to both bookclubs and socialism but I do not know much about them personally. \n\nAnd of course, you can always start one yourself! Make a Zoom group, post about it online and maybe post local fliers too, specifically for what language you speak; you might be surprised how many people would be interested. I would recommend discretion if your country is more right-wing though; focus on it as studying economic and political theory (which it is) rather than describing it as \"socialist\" which could attract the wrong sorts of people (like right-wing trolls.) But on the other hand, you do want to attract people actually interested in socialist theory, so being too discreet could end with a lot of confused people, so it's ultimately up to you, how you want to describe it.   \nDon't get discouraged if there's not much attention though. I think reading groups are more appealing to people who already know each other, honestly, so it's probably best to try and make your reading group with friends, coworkers or family, if possible, and let them bring in their friends, too. It could be a good way to keep in-touch with loved ones and get to know people. The first few meetings tend to be the most awkward but after that it's a lot of fun, or so I hear, anyway.   \n  \nI recommend [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and [https://www.marxists.org/](https://www.marxists.org/) for free access to books for everyone. \n\nOh, and if you're interested in organizations beyond reading groups, I think the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World) might be of interest? They seem to have worldwide chapters, so I hope there's one where you live, if you weren't aware of them already. \n\nBest of luck, friend!",
