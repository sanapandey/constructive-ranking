Even internationally, the dismantling of USAID, a major institution of American \"soft power,\" practically overnight should signal that something *may* be different. Such a situation deserves careful thought and examination. Neither is offered by this article.",

Which is useful in some contexts and not in others.\n\n\n>And the fact so much of the economic \"growth\" in the US or China is predicated on debt is, in the long-term, a real problem for global capitalism.\u00a0If you can't see that then yes, maybe stick to your CNN or MSNBC.\u00a0\n\n\nI claim the article is so poorly written that you'd get close to the truth from reading betwennthe lines of liberal propaganda then trying to decipher this article.\u00a0\n\n\nYou use, \"growth\" without definition. Why do you speak without knowledge? What us is that to leftists like you and I? I can clearly see China has \"growth\" by the fact that it has within many decades since the revolution.\u00a0\n\n\nYou imply China's debt is bad for global capitalism. I don't see how that should be a concern for a leftists.\n\n\n>If you can't see that then yes, maybe stick to your CNN or MSNBC.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm a leftist correcting what I believe is incorrect analysis. That's my duty as a leftists as Mao has called out. You insult me like a liberal because capitalist social media algorithms are pushing you towards pithy remarks instead of trying to enlighten me and your fellow leftists on any mistakes in our analysis.\u00a0\n\n\nIf I am wrong show me so I can see where I have gone wrong",

It is undialectal to resist such an analysis in favor of repeating yesterday's critique which no longer functions as critique but is correctly regarded as the historical basis of the current situation. \n\nThe US has been ruled by capital from its inception, but this has taken different shapes throughout its history. Many of the forms which have characterized that rule since the end of the second world war, and some more fundamental ones dating back even to its founding, are now being aggressively dismantled by one section of that ruling class while the other appears helpless to stop them. Why is that happening and why now? Marxists, socialists, and communists should want to understand that development and not be satisfied with \"well, it's all just the ruling class\" hand waving.\n\nOnly through correct analysis of the current situation can we understand how to move within it. It will not do to merely pretend that nothing has changed *without first offering an analysis justifying that idea.* And bears pointing out that this is not an academic exercise. The stakes for leftists living in the US and territories targeted by the new fascism could not be higher.",

There was some continuity, in the first few weeks, between Kurt von Schleicher and Hitler, but this only tells us that they stepped into an office within a set of pre-existing institutions representing a given nation state.

What I'm asking for is not a simple thing. It demands a developed theoretical mind, but this is a moment to challenge ourselves because things are changing fast and \"the left,\" broadly conceived as ever, is in the crosshairs.

Also, this site is tacitly anarchist in stature, clearly anti-Stalinist. No mention of Marxism-Leninism, only constant revolution, which implies Trotskyism.\n\n  \nHere is some advice for anyone reading this article and treating it uncritically. Do some reading of any revolutionary movements, their premises of revolution and why they happened to how the futures of their people would grow under socialism moving with the world. Read Marx, Engels, Lenin, Kim Il Sung, Mao, Ho Chi Minh, etc. See how they propose socialism with the changes in the world. If they are ultra-leftist and dogmatic, they will fail. The world does not work that way. It takes time to get people to see that their best interests are that of everyone's best interests in solidarity in socialism and finally making to communism.",
