    "selftext": "For too long, workers have been left struggling while corporations hoard profits and power. Wages stagnate, industries exploit labor, and those in charge make sure the system keeps benefiting them. But what if work was structured to serve people instead of profit?\n\nThat\u2019s the idea behind the Equitable Future Initiative (EFI) and the Public Industry Administration Model (PIAM)\u2014a structured path toward worker-led industries, economic democracy, and a system that guarantees everyone a fair share of what they produce.\n\nInstead of endlessly reforming capitalism, EFI lays out a new foundation where industries are run by those who actually do the work. No more billionaire parasites dictating how we live.\n\nIf this resonates with you, check it out here: ourworldandfuture.com/equitable-future-initiative\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts\u2014what would it take to make this kind of system a reality?",

But that\u2019s the opposite of what I\u2019m advocating for. EFI is about worker-led industry governance and economic democracy\u2014moving beyond capitalism, not reforming it. Would love to hear your thoughts on how we push this forward in a way that avoids neoliberal pitfalls!",
