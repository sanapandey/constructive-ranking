    "selftext": "I feel like this can be so hard to do, yet sometimes simple too. Interacting with your own local community can sometimes seem impossible given the lack of any kind of \"third place\" to even socialize (no pun intended). Internet culture and consumerism has pushed us to these hyper individualistic self-selling products, and all of our hopes and fears have been commodified. Human connection has been commodified. Hope (gambling, sports betting, crypto scams telling you that you can have power and agency over your life). I used to be staunchly anti-social media and still consider myself a Luddite but have come to focus my hatred on the corporations themselves rather than the users. I understand it can be the only place for some people to connect to others, and even organize politically. \n\nBut even just going out to pick up trash is a simple way to step outside that constant technological framework we exist within and engage with our community on a local level, even if you're not necessarily meeting many new people. Idk I'm trying to figure this out more and more. I want to join my local democratic socialist branch but I don't know if we really have one.\n\nI feel like with the US going to hell on the federal level it's up to us to support our communities on theocal level. We can no longer look for hope or change or help from the government. I'm also curious along those lines of people think there are different political ideologies for different points in time. Lately I've been wondering if something more like ANARCHY->SOCIALISM might be required. \n\nI've started a podcast focusing on homelessness since I was homeless myself for 3 years and that's the thing that I hope I can help make change with. I might be getting this homeless outreach job soon too. But it took me a long time to get to this point. Addiction and shit made my existence pretty self centered for a long time. I hope by sharing people's personal stories with first hand interviews that I can spread compassion and understanding for people who are experiencing homelessness. Still can be a very abstract thing that is hard to measure the effects of. Which is why it would be nice to engage locally. \n\nSorry if this is kind of rambling but I'm just wondering how y'all engage locally, want to engage locally, what avenues in your life do you feel like you can make the world a little bit better for some people?

            "body": "I\u2019m extremely bogged down by late-stage capitalism and am incredibly broke at the moment, with little mental energy or time to do what I would like to be doing, but I try to do little things here and there;\n\n- I wear an N95 mask everywhere I go and carry extra masks with me in case anyone wants one. Covid-19 never ended and pretending like it did because Biden and the CDC said it was ok only accelerated the status quo aka fascism. Covid-19 has been and still is a war on the proletariat. I don\u2019t want to get sick and if I\u2019ve caught something, I don\u2019t want to pass it to anyone. We need to take care of each other and pretending like it ended isn\u2019t the right thing to do. There are democrats trying to enact mask bans right now. The ruling class doesn\u2019t give a fuck about any of us and wearing a mask is not only a radical act of community care + self preservation but it is a stance against the fascism provoked by both democrats and republicans. \n\n- I carry extra snacks with me to give out if I encounter someone who is hungry on the subway or on the street. It\u2019s not much but it\u2019s something. \n\n- . I don\u2019t buy fast fashion. The majority of my wardrobe is vintage / thrifted 1970s clothes and/or secondhand, the stuff that is new is slow fashion that I splurged on years ago and is still good to this day. Mindless material consumerism is unattractive, unnecessary, and low quality. \n\n- I\u2019m getting involved with my local mask bloc + mutual aid orgs in the community because I am super interested in community care and mutual aid. I\u2019m also going back to school for nursing this year and am looking forward to eventually having a medical skill set that can come in handy somehow. \n\n- I don\u2019t vote for genocidal democrats or republicans. I no longer vote for the Democratic Party. I do not believe in the lesser of two evils because they are both equally abhorrent and dangerous. I regularly point out the hypocrisy and flaws in liberalism, the Democratic Party, etc, have these discussions with people in person and on the internet. I read a book or two every week, listen to podcasts, and try to stay on my toes. \n\n\nI\u2019m not doing everything I could be doing but I have goals and am doing what I can at the moment. And most importantly, these are things I do consistently and plan on doing consistently no matter who is in office because they\u2019re all working against us. I don\u2019t think there is a way we can ever really look for hope or change from the government considering how the US was built and has always been this way.",
