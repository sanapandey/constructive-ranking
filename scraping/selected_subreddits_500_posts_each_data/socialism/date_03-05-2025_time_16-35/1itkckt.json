    "selftext": "Im pretty sure this will be taken down. Not because im a right winger who hates this sub (why are u guys even here go where the pepper grows [how us germans like to say]) but because i kinda know it goes against the purpose of this sub, but i wanna say it anyways and hope people will see it.\n\nI did a post asking about labour shortage in Communism and u guys really explained this topic in its complexity really well so that i now know what else to look for, how to educate myself more and actually know more about the specific question. Im from germany and recently joined \"the left\" party and im really trying to get more competent in this whole topic because i personally think its the right way in the long term.\n\nSo i just wanted to say that i really appreciate how respectful, competent and kindly my question was treated here even though i now know it probably belongs to r/socialism101 \n\nSo just thanks comrades. If any mods see this i know it\u2019s probably an irrelevant post thats gonna get taken down because it isnt on topic but i just wanted to tell the people here that even though that was my first post i felt really well treated here. So id really really like for this post to stay up for a while just so people here can see an honest \"review\" from a new member here <3",
