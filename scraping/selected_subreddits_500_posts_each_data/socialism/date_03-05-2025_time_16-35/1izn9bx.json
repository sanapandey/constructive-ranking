This type of technology very much still only lives in the realm of sci-fi and while it's important to posit the implications of such technology in the capitalist framework it's also important to remain grounded in reality, facts and data. As it stands neualink has been incredibly unsuccessful even though they have moved to human trials. Don't listen to the hype from these tech billionaires, they're mostly all talk when it comes to this stuff and while we should be concerned about their eventual end goals we need to be realistic about how much power and control they actually have technologically and otherwise.",
