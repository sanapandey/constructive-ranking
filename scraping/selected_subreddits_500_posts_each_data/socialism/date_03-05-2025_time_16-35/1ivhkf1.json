Meanwhile ancoms are present in every modern struggle against things like prisons, policing, and militarism where you'll rarely see ancaps. In fact you'd be more likely to find a self described ancap at a pro cop rally. \n\nIt's not shocking because anarcho capitalism isn't real, it's something that was created by capitalist propagandists to seal off the potentiality of the American appeal to \"anti authority\" individualism leading to individualists becoming keen to anarcho communist theories on individualism in relation to property. They wanted to funnel those potential people further down the opposite direction. This wasn't an accident, no, these people had ties to the cia. They knew what they were doing. They hijacked the word libertarian and anarchist, or attempted to, to seal off the public from discovering those theories. They fully succeeded in stealing the term libertarian, but never fully restructured the anarchist movement like they wished to. Anarchists were hostile to these ideas off the rip. The propagandists needed to thwart every form of communist struggle. The people who came up with ancap are the people who planned pinochets economy, so it makes sense. A classic case of fascist reactionary movements utilizing imagery and aesthetic of the left to create confusion and counter recruit.",

Rather than the classical liberal approach of small state with big market, they\u2019ve accepted that they need a strong state to enforce the market. And what better way to enforce something than an all powerful authority such as a monarch? We already see Trump and Musk breeding like rabbits to try and find their true heirs, and acting as though law doesn\u2019t apply to them. \n\nI don\u2019t entirely know how to wrap this concept to my previous statement eloquently atm but I\u2019ve been studying the roots of western conservatism lately because my education was way more focused on liberalism, in spite of the fact that I\u2019m from a southern state (also probably just paid attention to that more because I was a shitlib back then as well). Liberals and conservatives both share a common ancestry in the US with the founding of the nation, and ideological clashes on federalism vs confederalism etc. are well documented, but I hadn\u2019t pieced together that conservatism goes all the way back and has its roots in the Romantic Era. The era that rejected enlightenment liberal democracy, enlightenment social democrats, and opposed revolutions such as those seen in France\u2014 favoring traditions, beauty and aesthetics, nature, religious rule that preceded Nations and national borders, and hierarchies that they perceive to be \u201cnatural.\u201d Knowing these roots, it\u2019s helped me to understand how conservative western proletarians can be so keen on Trump ruling entirely and imposing his will on the entire nation. And much like the Counter-Enlightenment of the Romantic Era being reactionary against the intellectual elitism of parliamentary rule developed during the Enlightenment, it is completely understandable to me how we are seeing such a reactionary force in motion right now. \n\nAncap has concentrated power in the CEOs and private property, and the Dark Enlightenment provides them with a way to protect their private property \n\nI definitely recommend that podcast episode, it gets really into the weeds on neoliberal globalization and they also discuss the strange and extreme LARP behavior that these CEOs and ancap philosophers tend to do (literally LARPing irl as a practice for how they might achieve real world ideological goals; this kinda put ideologically driven communities into a new perspective for me lol)",
