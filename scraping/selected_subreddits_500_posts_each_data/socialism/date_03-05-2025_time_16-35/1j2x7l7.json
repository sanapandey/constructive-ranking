What can we expect this Trump administration to do? Specifically I'm looking for what you think is likely, not just what we aren't know from Project 2025. ",

I'm worried as well but I'm also trying to capture this moment and the news is a dumpster fire, so getting what things people are actually scared of is somewhat refreshing.

If there would be a time to make revolutionary moves this would be the admin when you have the Dems losing their minds and hopefully MAGA will eventually see. MAGA is fairly glazed over but they are staunchly working class even more so than the Dems but breaking through that yt supremacy is going to be tough. They stand deep in it and MAGA uses that as their wedge to divide the parties. But he exposes the under belly of imperialism and a lot of ppl are freaking tf out and rethinking everything they\u2019ve been taught.",
