I hardly think that the ethnic cleansing of the Caucasus and Crimea during 1944-5 is worthy of any kind of praise, for instance, quite the opposite! Likewise with the mass arrests and summary executions during the Great Purge of 1937-8.",

Any socialist should exercise critical thought and look at achievements and failures in context in a historiographical way rather than uncritically condemn or celebrate an individual.  It requires a scientific approach.  \nThe human cost of Stalin was enormous, but anyone arguing it should be considered in isolation as some kind of situation peculiar to socialism, and disregarding the precise historical conditions at the time, is entirely disingenuous.    \n  \nThe story of imperialism and capitalism is soaked in blood and is still happening today.  \nThe countries enacting this violence do not have the ostensible motivation of being embattled from all sides by hostile rivals committed to their total eradication - they are simply pursuing their own enrichment.",
