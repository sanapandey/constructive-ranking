    "selftext": "In my opinion what's going on has to be seen from the perspective of economic interests of the empire and the tension between interest groups inside the empire. Donald Trump has accepted about 400 million dollars in bribes (called campaign contributions in U.S.) from the oil and gas sector, (sectorally the biggest amount) and has been an advocate for fracking and \"drill, baby, drill\". This means he will not lift sanctions on Russia creating a big rival for U.S. oil and gas in Europe again. \n\nRussia knowing what the U.S. establishment stands for will also not put much faith in an alleged wedge-driving operation by U.S. \u00e0 la Sino-Soviet split which they will see only as an anomalous interlude (obviously they will try to use the temporary respite by trying to appeal to Trump's ego), in the continuum of U.S. strategic thinking about using Russia to revive and keep NATO as the crucial alliance structure which they see as their biggest trump card against China. \n\nNow if Trump doesn't plan to lift sanctions and Russia knows this and the fact that any U.S. deal can be broken by the next admin (as they did in the case of JCPOA), then this seems to me to signal that no real peace deal is possible with these attitudes. \n\nNow Trump absorbing the criticism of the establishment about wasting American taxpayer money into his own person, will have to do something about that to appease supporters. The answer: we're gonna get billions worth of minerals for the weapons we're giving, so we're not spending our own money. This pr move was played in Afghanistan about the 1 trillion dollars worth of minerals in Afghanistan being cited as justification by a New York Times op-ed back in 2013, for prolonged U.S. presence there. \n\nObviously they knew back then that very little investment in mining operations are being done by U.S. companies (data shows it being in a downturn for a decade) and with the ease with which through financialization and stock buybacks these companies can make money, productive investment is not exactly their priority. Hence the argument was a front for PMCs and military-industrial complex. \n\nThis 500 billion dollar claim is the same thing. It's a ploy by the establishment of GOP (represented here by Rubio) to provide a face-saving win for Trump without stopping the U.S. foreign policy plans. \n\nEnter Peter Thiel's man: J. D. Vance. Palantir, and other U.S. companies feel like they're not getting as much out of this conflict as they can. One way to make a lot more money would be to be able to sell to richer European countries much more than to the war-torn Ukraine. But that would be possible if they were buying. There ain't buying. A good way to make them buy is to show them they're not under the Empire's protective umbrella, so they have to increase military spending (a slow military spending would not be as beneficial to U.S. as it could be planned in tandem with an increase in military productive capacity in Europe). \n\nZelenskyy knows in all of this that signing a humiliating deal is the end of his political career and might lead to jail down the line so he has to walk a tight rope of presenting himself as negotiable and for peace while not accepting the deal proposed by the people who want to oust him to get a more obedient servant in his place.\n\nTldr; So you have one side who doesn't want to lift sanctions on Russia hence supports the old guards' plan of confrontation with China through leadership of an alliance (in Europe through NATO), but has to give a pr win to Trump to appease some of his base about the military spending (i.e. subsidies to old military-industrial complex) through talk of 500 billion non-existent mineral deal. Then there's the other silicon valley side who wants to export to Europe and wants them to increase their spending by making them continue the war on their own and to achieve this has to convince people that they had to back away from supporting Ukraine because they were for peace and Ukrainian leadership wasn't for peace. Zelenskyy has to show he's for negotiations but can't accept such a deal as it would doom his career. \n",

It\u2019s one of the biggest, yet easiest, lies to debunk, and it\u2019s scary how many people are buying into it. Actually makes me think dead internet theory is real af.",
