    "selftext": "Yep... 800 million people lifted from poverty by the CCP. How about that for the \"failure of Marxism?\".\n\nWithout China the amount of poor people in the world i.e those living at less than about $7 a day, massively increased.\n\nMeanwhile last year billionaire wealth has increase $ 2T. The collective wealth of 3k billionaires is $ 15T. More than any country on Earth besides China and the US.\n\nOne has thousands of times more chances of being struck by lightning or be eaten by a shark rather than become a billionaire. Meritocracy is a sham and myth akin to \"divine right to rule\" used on the masses by Monarchs in previous eras.\n\nThey are not geniuses but thieves and nepo babies. And to deflect the unfairness of their positions and privileges they claim the real enemy are immigrants or minorities. In short the more it changes the more it is the same... we are back in early 1800s in London at the Dawn of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWhatever \"Middle Class\" ever existed in America and the Western world was due to a wealth pump accumulating resources either stolen inside the Americas and/or colonies and concentrated enough so the crumbs of it would prevent the proletariat from being in slums... but now that is falling apart and the masks are off for all to see.\n\nJust like Paris' Commune, the Bolchevik Revolution, and in an extreme case the Khmer Rouges which were a massive cleansing wildfire, the sociopathic elites are bound to pay sooner or later for this collective misery and rightfully so. And furthermore they are the ones responsible for innocent blood spilled to wipe them out the same way as a criminal pursued by authorities who kill an innocent while subduing him can charge him with said innocent murder.",

Communist Vietnam just beat the US, and in making enemies with Pol Pot the US thus started viewing the KR as an ally to support. \n\nOverall, the whole situation in SE Asia is more one of Vietnam attempting to throw off outside influence from both the imperialist west and a dominating China, and the Khmer regime was useful to both sides as an indirect means of hurting Vietnam.

From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:\n\n>18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It averaged only 5.6%, compared to 51% in India, 36.5% in Indonesia and 29.5% in Brazil.\n\nWe find extreme poverty increased dramatically during the market reforms of the 1990s. It reached a peak of 68% as price deregulation pushed up the cost of basic food and housing, cutting the buying power of low-income people.\n\nExtreme poverty then slid during the 2000s, but has yet to fall to the levels calculated by the World Bank.\n\n...Our findings have important implications. They suggest that although industrial development is an important goal, it can\u2019t be relied upon to cut extreme poverty in and of itself, at least not in the context of capitalist reforms and social policy retrenchment.\n\nPublic ownership, price controls, and universal access to social services, of the kind advanced in China before the market reforms, can be at least as effective, especially at low levels of economic development.\"",

            "body": "I do not think this is the \"gotcha\" you are making it out to be, although I assume good faith. To begin, I think it's interesting to note the other post here claiming it was actually *before* the Dengist market reforms when China saw the greatest poverty reduction, with extreme poverty actually getting worse with the embracing of the free market. \n\nBut either way, since 'Marxism' was invoked here, it begs the question: *what is the political economic horizon of Marxism?*\n\nIs it simply poverty reduction? And if so, what to make of the fact that Indonesia/India/Brazil/Mexico have also made great strides in poverty reduction using capitalist means over the last several decades? What would make Marxism special since we see that poverty reduction can also be achieved by capitalist reforms?\n\nOr, is a fundamental goal of Marxism entrusting the carrying out of state functions to the masses, instead of the the prerogative of special echelons of party officials, as Mao declared on the eve of the Cultural Revolution? If we agree with Mao here, how does present-day China measure up to that goal?\n\nOr, is the abolition of private property and the communal ownership of all goods the main demand of communists, as stated by Engels in his \"Principles of Communism\"? If we agree with Engels here, we must then ask if the Dengist reforms have made that goal more or less likely to be achieved in China?\n\nOr, is a fundamental goal of Marxism \"the union of the working people of the whole world into a World Soviet Socialist Republic\" as Stalin commented in his reflections upon the founding of the Soviet Union? If we think Stalin's vision has merit, what is the CPC program to help bring this goal to reality?\n\nThe examples could go on and these are very broad horizons indeed, but it is within this vision that Marxists should be assessing the progress of Chinese socialism, rather than focusing on poverty reduction, which risks feeding into to capitalist worldviews.",

While even in some developed countries there are slums, homeless people, and criminal gangs composed of desperate outcasts, in China, generally none of these issues  exist any more. Even the poorest workers can find employment and easily earn enough to meet their basic needs.\n\nMoreover, thanks to massive infrastructure development by state-owned enterprises that are not solely profit-driven, even the most remote villages benefit from affordable public transportation and internet access.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge that China, in some respects, is even more \"capitalist\" than capitalism itself. For example, almost all private employers flout labor laws, mainly by imposing forced overtime, while labor unions and organized strikes are strictly prohibited. This leaves employees with limited means to protect their legal rights, primarily through labor arbitration and litigation.\n\nYes, China is exploiting its own working class to beat the capitalist West, much like we exploited peasants and provided preferential treatment to workers to build an industrial system during Mao's time.\n\nAs Marx famously said: \"The bourgeoisie, during its rule of barely one hundred years, has created more massive and colossal productive forces than all preceding generations together.\"\n\nThe failure of the socialist camp in the 20th century may suggest that socialism could not 'squezze out' as many productive forces as capitalism. Therefore, to overcome capitalism and support the development of the Third World, China must run a capitalist system better than capitalism itself\u2014under the control of a proletarian vanguard, a Leninist party.\n\nTo build a new world, the proletariat will have to uplift the entire world.\n\n\"The question is not what goal is envisaged for the time being by this or that member of the proletariat, or even by the proletariat as a whole. The question is what is the proletariat, and what course of action will it be forced historically to take in conformity with its own nature.\"\n\n\u2014 Marx, *The Holy Family*",

From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:\n\n>18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
