I also love that the FDP fell out of the Bundestag but my main question is about the BSW. Like in theory they should be great since they originated from die Linke but I always hear negative stuff and that they are right wing on some issues. My question is, are you happy that they seemingly didn\u2019t make the bundestag. And why are they bad? And generally what are your thoughts?",

            "body": "As far as my understanding goes the BSW drew a lot (around 200 members) of the most problematic characters from DieLinke away and has since then embraced a mix of left- and right-wing populist positions. E.g. the majority of the BSWs MPs voted with the CDU and AFD in that fateful vote about the \"Zustrombegrenzunggesetz\".\n\nSo they are not a party that any real leftist could full heartily support. And even their main argument is that they will siphon votes away from the AFD has not worked out and only further moved the overton window to the right.\n\nSimultaneously it resulted in a much less divided DieLinke which now for the most part is quite united in a strong left progessive anti-capitalist consensus, which resulted in more than 20000 new members since the split.\n\nAnd one last thing I want to say is, that now after the Election and with the results now tallied: If the BSW would have entered the Bundestag, it would have resulted in the necessity (because of electoral math) for a coalition between CDU, SPD and Gr\u00fcne which would have been much less stable than the projected GroKo (great Koalition between the CDU and SPD). Most likey that would have resulted in more stagnation while the likelihood earlier new election would have been much higher. Now the old and once big centrist \"Volksparteien\" will be collectively in charge for the next 4 years while the progressive partis and the fucking nazis will be in the opposition.\n\nThat is kind of the best possible outcome while still being very dangerous and I myself see clear parallels between our time and the \"Weimarer Republik\". And we have to defeat the fascists unless we want to repeat the past.\n\nOne final thing. That the FDP was thrown out the parliament is the one and truly great outcome of last nights election and was truly deserved. \n\nFuck them! If the Election would have been held half a year later as was the normal date, my guess is, that more people worldwide would have been appalled by the state of the world and I hope fascism will become more unpalatable the more the USA further devolves into an authoritarian hellhole .",

Honestly hopefully y\u2018all will do better in these upcoming years but my guess is that, with how much the general politics have shifted to the right, (even from SPD/Gr\u00fcne) Things will get even worse for germany. And since the AFD can always claim to be the \u201etrue solution\u201c because they\u2018re not a part of the government, they will continue to grow. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the CDU will loose votes in a similar quantity as die Gr\u00fcne/SPD did this election and that the AFD will be the strongest party soon.

It does allow for some analysis though:\n\n\\- Among the 18-24 demographic, the AfD, Linke and BSW got a combined 51%. While these parties differ greatly in their policies, they all ran on the premise that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way this country has been run for at least the last 30 years. This shows that many young people are not happy with the self-appointed \"democratic center\" of CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens and FDP. Unfortunately, many of them are flocking to the AfD, but the Left Party has clearly managed to convince many of those who oppose fascism that their more radical solutions (in rhetoric at least) are the best antidote to fascists. The radical left can use this by showing these people options to the left of the Left Party and getting them organized against fascism and the capitalist system from which it arises.\n\n\\- Right-wing politics has become very popular with a lot of people and the radical left needs a credible counter-narrative. While the Left Party enjoyed quite a success, the biggest winners of the night were the AfD, who have been very publicly shown to be deeply connected to some of the worst fascists in the country, and the CDU/CSU, who have made a turn to more openly right-wing rhetoric since 2021. They won over half the votes in an election with the largest voter turnout since 1990. The issue on which they won is migration and religious fundamentalism, partly because the left has no credible policies on these topics. Immigration to Germany will continue to happen, the left ought to embrace that rather then deny it, and religious fundamentalism (not just in the Muslim communities the right likes to point at, but across all religious groups) is a growing issue that requires some left-wing answers instead of brushing the topic aside.\n\n\\- Finally, the radical left can learn some things from the Left Party, most importantly that the concept of \"verbindede Klassenpolitik\" (unifying class politics) works. It may also be worth it to strengthen the presence of the radical left in online spaces to show young people an alternative on the left. Finally, it remains of vital importance to be engaged in our communities and run campaigns especially on the social issues faced by many. The return of the not-so-grand-anymore grand coalition is bound to create even more resentment towards the two parties that have been in government almost constantly over the last 20 years, we can build on that.",

It would've been interesting to see them in the Bundestag as a party openly in support of Palestine and strongly opposed to the war in Ukraine, but that's about it. Their socio-economic policies are basically on par with the SPD or CDU/CSU and their policies on trans people and climate change are outright abysmal. The Left Party has thankfully taken a clear stance against the war in Ukraine and in support of negotiations, and while some of their members aren't great on Palestine, some of their Bundestag members are solid, especially Ferat Ali Kocak, who entered the Bundestag by winning the Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln district after running a fantastic campaign and has been very openly pro-Palestine for a long time. Ultimately, I think we're better off without the BSW in the Bundestag, especially given that them entering likely would've meant a coalition of CDU/CSU, SPD and Greens being the only viable government without the AfD and while a small accelerationist part of me wants to see that, the more rational side of my brain knows that such a government would probably boost the AfD to over 30%.",

I disagree that Ukraine's fate is sealed. Militarily Russia is suprisingly weak, especially when it comes to logistics. Giving the Ukrainians access to advanced missile technology would allow them to strike military installations in the heart of Russia, greatly reducing battlefield effectiveness. Weapons distribution can make a difference.\n\nAbandoning Ukraine would hurt way more people in a way more serious way eventually. And it would give way to a ruler that's supporting authotarian regimes and parties like AfD worldwide. While my heart goes out to the Linke, they are simply too naive and idealistic to make such a hard decision. They live in Lalaland when it comes to defense. Which I understand, I'd rather have it we wouldn't have a military at all. But that choice has been made for us already.\n\nPolitically die Gr\u00fcnen are not comparable with CDU/CSU at all.
