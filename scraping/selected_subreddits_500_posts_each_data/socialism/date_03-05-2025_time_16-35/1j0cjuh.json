Yeah Trump would have liked Ukraine as a colony to extraxt resources from, but barring that he's fine with the war grinding on just without the US invovled.\n\nIf you watch the whole train wreck today it's clear JD Vance jumped in to sabotage the conversation on purpose. It was all coordinated to be a mess so Trump can walk away saying he \"tried.\" The American Empire used Ukraine, abused Ukraine, and now is just going to abandon it.",

It's just one of those \"once the toothpaste is outta the tube\" situations, imo. If Ukraine gains a Nuclear Arsenal, it will trigger an arms race in Eastern Europe. If Iran gains a nuclear arsenal, it will trigger an arms race in the Middle East, and soon you have a powder keg of global nuclear annihilation in your hands. I believe the more responsible approach we socialists must pursue is educating and arming our international comrades with conventional weaponry and tactics in order to combat imperialism across the globe.",
