    "selftext": "Hello all! I was listening to Upstream Podcast's recent episode called China Pt. 1: A Socialist Introduction with Dr. Jason Hickel. https://www.upstreampodcast.org/conversations\n\nTowards the end of the teaser, Hickel asserts that:\n\n\"Most westerners assume that the Tiananmen Square protests were against communism. But in fact, the exact opposite is true: they were protesting against the U.S. backed capitalist reforms.\"\n\nI love Hickel, and really enjoyed his book The Divide. I tend to trust that what he's saying here is true and not just made up, but having lived in China and been in proximity to this history over the last 10 years, this was actually news to me. I've tried to verify it briefly online, but can't find anything. I would love to see any text or sources that back up this claim, if it is indeed true. I am fully aware that this history has been used in western imperiast propaganda many times so finding anything that challenges that narrative is probably not at the surface, but I genuinely just want to know what's true. If any of you all have knowledge of this history or where this idea comes from, please help point me in the right direction so I can educate myself better :)\n\nThanks!",

Whereas the protests were led by Maoist students who thought that China had become too capitalist and they wanted the army to stage a coup to return to Maoist policies. That's why the Tankman was trying to *prevent* the tanks from exiting the square instead of preventing them from entering like in the edited BBC video. They wanted the tanks to go to the government to do a coup - not leave the square.",

Inflation had raged in the urban centres during the late 1980s, but the party/state leadership had shown little capacity to deal with it...\n\nThe Democracy Movement was, up until June 4, more a move for \"democratisation\". The push for \"democratisation\" leaned significantly, for political and ideological sustenance, on what was viewed, especially by Chinese students, as a contemporary trend to democratise the state and party in the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nThe mistake, intentional or otherwise, of many foreign journalists who had flown in for the Gorbachev visit during April and had stayed on to cover the events in the square, was to assume that \"democratisation\" implied a general desire of the students to embrace Western bourgeois-democratic models within the context of a capitalist system. In reality, few students at the time had more than a very hazy theoretical notion of \"bourgeois democracy\". Many felt that, given China's poverty and other problems, transplanted \"bourgeois-democratic models\" were not appropriate.\"\u00a0\n\n- https://links.org.au/china-looking-back-1989-democracy-movement-and-tiananmen-square-massacre\n\n\"The second narrative, much less influential than the first but nonetheless widely circulated among segments of the Chinese and international left, interprets the movement in the framework of \u201csocialism vs. capitalism.\u201d In this narrative, China\u2019s marketization reforms in the 1980s produced severe inflation and rising inequality, which hurt the livelihoods of urban populations and gravely intensified discontent. Therefore, the 1989 Tiananmen Democracy Movement was in fact an anti-market, anticapitalist movement triggered by material grievances...\n\nThe \u201csocialism vs. capitalism\u201d narrative acknowledges workers\u2019 role in the movement but obscures the fact that democratic aspirations were indeed the dominant theme. These aspirations cannot be captured by the economic dimension of \u201canticapitalism.\u201d Moreover, even though discontent with marketization proved crucial in forging workers\u2019 participation, workers in the movement did not express any wish to return to the era before marketization. Almost absent as well was any nostalgia about the Maoist era or Mao himself.\n\nWe need to simultaneously break away from both of these narratives, rejecting the exclusive focus on students and intellectuals, taking workers seriously, and at the same time acknowledging that \u201cdemocracy\u201d was the core demand of workers as well. Most importantly, \u201cdemocracy\u201d as understood by workers was different from the liberal notion embraced by students and intellectuals; it was a distinctly socialist vision of democracy premised on the agency of the working class. This dimension of the 1989 Tiananmen Democracy Movement, as a workers\u2019 movement fighting for socialist democracy, is important both for the writing of history and politically, but has been mostly forgotten.\"\n\n- https://jacobin.com/2019/06/tiananmen-square-worker-organization-socialist-democracy",
