    "selftext": "I apologise if this is the wrong place to post something like this, or if I\u2019m rambling, but this is something I need to get off my chest and seek advice for - with those of the political direction I\u2019ve continued to move toward.\n\nI grew up privileged. My family did not initially come from wealth, but my parents have gotten quite wealthy from eventually getting their upper management roles in a \u201cdefence contractor\u201d - managers for the fucking Military Industrial Complex. I didn\u2019t think much of it growing up. Even into college, when I started to look down their jobs, I was never too confrontational about it. I very much regret not making more noise about it when I was younger.\n\nThe genocide in Palestine was, as you might\u2019ve guessed, the breaking point. It was the turning point too, for me politically - previously, I was just an fool.\n\nNow I feel gross about not only my upbringing, but the support I\u2019ve received from them as well, the way I\u2019ve benefitted off of this heinous industry. I\u2019m even tied up in co-owning an apartment with them - the only way I could afford it, justified at the time by not wanting to keep renting to some parasitic landlord. Now, I can\u2019t help but think of this place as paid for with blood. I wish I could buy them out, but that will take a long time - if ever - and wouldn\u2019t get rid of this stain. I could let them buy me out and just rent there, but it\u2019s another twisted solution.  \n\nTalking to them is infuriating too - they are pretty standard liberals, who think their job is simply helping to defend the country. They are progressive otherwise, even admitting the brutality and war crimes of Israel, but can\u2019t see their own complicity. Neither of them work with actual munitions (communications, mostly), and so they blame the government for its own choices, and see this as enough to wash their hands. The worst part is, given the part of the company they are in is not that important, I do believe they aren\u2019t exposed to it as much, and this helps their consciences remain clear. For what little that\u2019s worth.\n\nI, for my part, feel like a hypocrite and a fool, for the benefits I\u2019ve reaped from their cushy jobs. It\u2019s maddening, and I don\u2019t know what I can do to extricate myself from this situation. The little comfort is one parent seeking employment elsewhere, as they see how it makes me feel view them, but that won\u2019t address these past harms in my upbringing.\n\nAnd, of course, the most horrifying part to come to terms with: they are still my parents. Despite their complicity, they were good to me. How do we come to terms with those we love blinding themselves and perpetuating these terrible systems?\n\nHow can I move forward? How can I make up for these benefits I\u2019ve received from something so horrific, and how can I approach my parents with this in mind? Is there any route aside from to cut and run?",
