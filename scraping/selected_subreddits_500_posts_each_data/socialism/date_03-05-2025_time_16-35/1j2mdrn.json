    "selftext": "Can someone explain what happened after apartheid ended in South Africa, and how that should or shouldn\u2019t happen in Palestine?  Or is the situation too different to compare? I\u2019m seeing @salma.shawa_ on Instagram saying they want Israelis out completely. I don\u2019t think that will ever happen with the Israeli government having nuclear weapons, western support, etc. In my mind it is much more likely to have a One State Solution if they stay, like S. Africa.",

A single, secular state for jews and muslims both might be possible but only if the Israeli occupiers allow it to happen, either by internal or international pressure. If the zionists continue as they have been then they will exterminate the Palestinians or be driven out of the country",
