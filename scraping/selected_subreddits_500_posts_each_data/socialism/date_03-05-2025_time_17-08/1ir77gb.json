    "selftext": "So, I've recently realized I'm a socialist, but I'm in business school (I know I know, but I plan to pivot to economics and hopefully specialize in Marxian economics and advocate for policy change). For context I'm in Europe and people tend to be fairly more pro welfare programs than in the US, but still, it is bussiness school. The majority of the people I am around talk about things that don't really resonate with my core values. I feel like ever since I educated myself and became enlightened, I see everything these people say as highly influenced by capitalist indoctrination. The excessive focus on self help/getting ahead/individualism, talking about issues without recognizing the unethical power structures that underlie them (I have a friend who talks about how amazing it is that in her home country her \"purchasing power\" is way better and lauds it as an \"amazing trait\" of her country, when I know her country has one of the highest wealth inequality indexes in the entire world and her \"luxury\" is only possible through the suffering of the poorer classes, etc. Even my well meaning friends, who think they are progressive, are really just reinforcing the neoliberal capitalist structures that exist in society. I'm feeling increasingly alienated from these people, and I don't know what to do. I enjoy hanging out with them most of the time, but I feel this distance towards them when we talk about the world, because I realized they don't see what I see. I can't really magically make myself leftist friends, so I'm sort of stuck with the people I have around me. Again, good people, but heavily indoctrinated, definitely not class conscious and much more focused on personal advancement and \"getting ahead\" in the bussiness world than on confronting or solving systemic issues than I am. I'm also so sick about hearing people idolize succesful bussinesspeople, seeing people be genuinely interested/passionate about working for or starting bussiensses...it just seems so freaking souless and empty to me. I could not give less of a shit about maximizing shareholder value and gaining a \"competetive edge\" in the market. I've tried to adopt the strategy of talking about our common points of interest (such as feminism, personal/spiritual/psyscological growth, and sometimes, they can make meaningful contributions to discussions on systemic issues, even if they don't \"see\" the full picture). But overall, I'm feeling increasingly alienated from everyone, and I don't know what to do. I like having people, having a group that appreciates me, and having people with which to pass the time and share my highs and lows. But I also feel like I'd feel much better if I found friends who were more on the same path as me. I'd love to hear about your experience with alienation when you became a socialist, and what you did. Can you mantain these people in your life, and aknowledge they are not evil or inferior for simply not having reached \"enlightenment\"? How did your relationship change with some people who didn't share your world view when you became a socialist? It's not an option for me to cut them off completely: I need to have freinds to mantain mental health and I also see they are good people who add to my life, even if they aren't really on the same wavelength as me. But still, its feeling lonely being around them listening to things I don't resonate with. Any advice or insight is appreciated. ",

            "body": "My bad news is that it\u2019s not just your friends or the people in school. This is the world. I\u2019m not sure of the socioeconomic backgrounds of your academic peers but they sound extremely sheltered and privileged, as though they haven\u2019t really lived life outside of being raised by their families and then put through college. They\u2019re in college - that is their only world right now. \n\nWhen I was in college I was extremely privileged (besides my dad being in prison but that\u2019s another story.) I wasn\u2019t necessarily wealthy by any means but I had family to fall back on / a support system and I was never unhoused, hungry, or without things I needed or wanted. I\u2019m not going to list all the ways I was privileged, let\u2019s just say I got great grades and got to have a lot of fun. It took experiencing extreme adversities + a lot of self educating for me to evolve from neoliberalism to communism and that happened over a span of a decade from the time I was 19 to 30. And guess what? No one could convince me to do that - that intellectual maturation had to happen on my own accord. People who are heavily indoctrinated will only come to the correct conclusions on their own, no one can convince them otherwise. \n\n\nYou need to understand where they\u2019re coming from and then you can also focus on yourself and continue educating yourself. You recently realized you\u2019re a socialist - start by reading up on theory. People ask for beginner book recommendations in this sub constantly, begin with those. When you discuss something that has to do with socialism with these people, try keeping it vague and not labeling it as socialism or communism and chances are that if they\u2019re not a complete piece of \ud83d\udca9, they\u2019ll agree with you, whereas if you labeled it as socialism or communism they would judge you and/or not take you seriously. And what level of school are you in / how old are these people? Your pre-frontal cortex isn\u2019t fully developed until you\u2019re in your late twenties (they say 25, but it really extends into the late twenties.) \n\nJust focus on educating yourself, thinking critically about everything (especially while you\u2019re in school and w/ the major you\u2019re in - I also went to business school and I think this will be incredibly valuable for you in your socialist journey) and not letting the various forms of propaganda schmooze you. \n\nAnd you might need to look outside of your existing friendships. Like I said, people are sort of in their own world in college especially if they have personally not faced many difficulties in life or really *lived* yet. I\u2019m sure there are other people like you in your school, seek them out. If you\u2019re looking for deeper connections / less surface level socialization, find it.",

                    "body": "Thank you so much for this answer. I'm 24 and in a masters program. \n\nIt's a little hard imagining how to \"seek out\" people who think alike, but I can try to look for leftist organizations, or maybe volunteering groups? I think a lot of leftist, communist, and socialist groups are more underground here, so my best luck is contacting random advertizing stickers with the communist logo in bars than finding any official pages online (which I've already tried). \n\nIf you don't mind me asking, could you speak a little bit more to how business school can be an asset for a socialist journey? And do you mind me asking how you found ways to contribute to the cause in your job or daily life? \n\nThanks again for this great advice, it makes me feel a little less alone.",
