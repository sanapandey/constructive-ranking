I haven't organized in a while and have moved progressively leftward since than.\n\nI'm thinking of joining the CPUSA and starting a branch in my home state. What I'm wondering is if that's a good idea?\n\nLike will having too many leftist orgs trying to do different organizing only make both weaker because of instead of a united front you'll have potential leftists split between the two groups? Or am I overthinking this? I just want to help not hurt leftist organizing in my state.",
