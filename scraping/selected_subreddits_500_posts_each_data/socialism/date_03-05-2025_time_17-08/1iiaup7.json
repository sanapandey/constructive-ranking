I've seen him becoming more and more conservative over the years, and it's clear he's in denial about it. \n\nIdk what to do anymore. He won't listen to reason. He won't even try to crosscheck what he sees and hears about elon and trump. Even when I send him links that contradict the crap he tries to sell me. He just takes it all at face value, and when I point out something, he can't refute he side steps with \"well no one is perfect\" and \"I guess we'll see.\" \n\nHe keeps calling himself a \"centrist\" when it's clear as day that he's leaning to the right more and more. I'm so frustrated, and lately, it's gotten to the point where I've considered ending an 8+ year-long friendship because it's becoming apparent that he has no real respect for me.\n\nI'm trying to be understanding, but I'm seriously out of patience for his bullshit. It's more than just his political views, but I won't get into his selfishness rn because this comment/rant is already running really long.\n\nIf anyone has any advice for me and how to at least provide him with another perspective that he might listen to, I'm all ears.",
