    "selftext": "Hi comrades, I wrote this article about a fascinating Marxist literary magazine from the 1930s. I think the Anvil offers an excellent example of how to represent and talk about socialism to workers in rural/culturally conservative areas. https://jacobin.com/2025/02/anvil-magazine-midwest-communism-conroy",
