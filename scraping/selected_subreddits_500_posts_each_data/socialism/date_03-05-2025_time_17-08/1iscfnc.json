    "selftext": "Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s Reform or Revolution dismantles the illusion that capitalism can be transformed through gradual reforms. \n\nShe critiques Eduard Bernstein\u2019s revisionism, arguing that the capitalist state serves the ruling class and can\u2019t be reformed into socialism. \n\nWhile reforms may improve conditions, they don\u2019t eliminate exploitation\u2014only revolution can. \n\nThis video breaks down Luxemburg\u2019s core arguments and their relevance to today\u2019s socialist struggle.",
