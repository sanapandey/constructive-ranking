But Ukraine and its \"allies\" could (and should) have conducted peace negotiations many months ago, and now Ukraine will probably end up with less, with countless more people dead, for no reason except that the Americans saw Ukraine as a useful pawn to be sacrificed.\n\nAnd Ukrainian self-determination may barely be given a place at the negotiating table.
