Being able to respond to an opponent without hurting yourself takes months sometimes years of daily training for some people. You just put the work in and do the martial art, not learn self defense. You understand the difference? If you are truly just teaching the martial art, you should rebrand. Advertising self defense is only going to attract people who want to learn a few moves and not put in the work, and then have a false sense of security about what they can do without having ever stress tested their abilities. BJJ is dangerous. People can get seriously hurt doing the sport. You shouldn't be throwing people into it for personal protection reasons, instead protect them.",
