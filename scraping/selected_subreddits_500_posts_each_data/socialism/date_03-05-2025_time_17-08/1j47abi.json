Now every day I feel like we\u2019re reaching a close to something terrible. I don't know if I can regain faith in this country. Am I alone thinking this way? ",

            "body": "This sounds like you are coming from a very Liberal mindset. Firstly i feel that it is worth mentioning that the people felt neglected by the lacklustre performance of the Biden administration in regards to raising their material conditions. There were a few reasons for this, firstly is the fact that, as I alluded to, the previous Democrat administration *did* do comparatively little to increase the standard of living, for example not implementing any major health care reforms to actually make health care an affordable service for most American Proletarians. They did pass some bare minimum reforms here and there, but hardly anything monumental or historic in scope and nothing even comparable to previous campaigns like the New deal or LBJ's 'Great Society' program for example. This factor merged with a general feeling of anger over the sending of billions worth in military aid to foreign American client states (Israel, Ukraine) whilst at home they claimed there simply was not enough of a budget for major reforms, a fact that was preyed upon by the Republicans who presented themselves (bogusly) as the \"peace vote\" a claim that was not helped by the Dems hawkish attitude towards foreign policy that they believed would appeal to the \"moderate voters\", eg. Kamala promising that under her tenure America would have the \"most lethal fighting forces\" in the world or their eagerness to accept the endorsement of the Chenenies. Lastly there was a lot of anger over how they tried to strong arm people into Supporting Biden, openly lying about his declining mental state and viciously attacking anyone suggesting they run a younger candidate and pointing out his advanced age and possible early signs of dementia. This, of course backfired, when they had to change over to Kamala running following the disastrous first debate. \nThe above commentary is not meant to dismiss or diminishe the fact that, also, yes, plenty of people voted for Trump out of hateful, bigoted opinions towards migrants, LGBTQ, Muslims etc. Etc. But it is worth remembering that there were also many proletarians, lacking class consciousness, who voted in the hopes that Trump would raise their quality of life by cracking down on \"the other\" that reactionary propaganda had made them believe were the cause of their economic malease. \n\nAt the end of the day the Democrats are still a Bourgeois party of the interests of various factions of the Capitalist class, they are not going to save you from the rise of Fascism, just like the Liberals in 1920s-30s Italy, Germany and Japan did not save their nations from the rising tide of hate. My advice is to try to talk to all people you know, including those who may have voted for trump for the reasons I mentioned above, and are not die hard MAGAs, the sort who we have recently seen bring outraged at what Elon and DOGE have been doing or Trumps absurd warmongering etc. Get these people on side, build mutual aid networks to plan and organise support for protests and strikes, if you are able to try to start a union at your work place or expand membership in existing ones, try to build class consciousness and teach your fellow workers about how it is the likes of Elon, Bezos and Trump that are making their lives miserable via Capitalist exploitation, not the minority groups vilified by the Fascists.\n\n*apologies for any spelling mistakes via out of place words in this comment. I typed this on my phone and my built in autocorrect is a buffoon that only ever \"corrects\" words I do not want changed! I tried to fix all of them but may have missed a few.",

What you're witnessing are the death throes of a dying empire, fighting to stay relevant in a world that's moved past it. It won't be pretty. It won't be fun. But it's a necessary step forward for humanity.",
