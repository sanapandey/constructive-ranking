    "selftext": "Hi all, so reading Capital is like reading the Bible for Christians. It\u2019s an important thing to do, but not many actually do it. \n\nSo, I thought I\u2019d offer some advice. Feel free to disagree, but here are my suggestions:\n\nYou could probably fill a library with insightful reviews, responses, commentary, and reflections on Marx's Capital, and many of the reviews on this site do add colour to the illustrious picture. However, since I don't feel that I would be able to add much, I won't waste anybody's time trying to add my own views or commentary. \n\nInstead, I'll offer brief pointers on reading Capital:\n\n*Read the book! Obvious, I know, but if you're like me you've probably expended a great deal of energy reading everything but the book itself, as a kind of countertransference, to escape getting the book read. \n\n*Be wary of guidebooks. It\u2019s more important  to read Capital on your own terms without focusing on somebody's else's perspective (and all of the digressions involved in that)\n\n*Engage with the text, scribble on it, make notes, highlight it, put sticky notes on it, underline sections, take notes, etc. Don't simply scan it passively like a newspaper article. Remember, this is one of the most important and influential texts in the social science canon, regardless of your individual view on its contents and style.\n\n*Acquaint yourself with some of the context of Marx's work. Maybe read an overview of political economy before and during Marx\u2019s time to understand who Adam Smith and the Physiocrats were. Have a look at the Poor Laws, the upheavals of the 1800s and try to find out why Marx was reading Hegel as a student.. Don't distract yourself by trying to get an expansive view of everything around Marx's life and context, but a brief read on Marxism like Isaiah Berlin\u2019s Karl Marx - His Life and Environment may be helpful, or Lenin\u2019s short portrait of Marx.  \n\n*Break the book up into chunks. Read it in chapters or 10-50 page bits a day, it\u2019s nothing. Doing this will help you understand the book a lot better. \n\n*READ THE BOOK! \n\n*If you can\u2019t read the full version read one of the abridged versions (e.g. Gareth Stedman Jones\u2019 abridgement or David McLellan\u2019s). \n\nReading recommendations:\nBerlin - Karl Marx: His Life and Environment\nBottomore - A Dictionary of Marxist Thought\nBrewer - A Guide to Marx\u2019s \u201cCapital.\u201d \nFine - Marx\u2019s \u201cCapital.\u201d \nFoley - Understanding Capital  \nMandel - An Introduction to Marxist Economic Theory\nRobinson - Reading Marx\u2019s Capital Volumes I\u2013III: A Guide (International Critical Thought)\nRosdolsky - The Making of Marx's Capital\nWheen - Karl Marx: A Life\nWheen - Marx\u2019s Das Kapital: A Biography ",

            "body": "Excellent recommendations \n\n Something I would add, and which I think is also very important, is to try to get a good translation. In Spanish there are versions of Capital that are classified as \"cult\" because they were made by prominent communists but in reality they are very poor translations and make it very difficult to read and understand the text properly. In recent years have appear updates and revised translations have been released that make the text much simpler and less tedious to read.",
