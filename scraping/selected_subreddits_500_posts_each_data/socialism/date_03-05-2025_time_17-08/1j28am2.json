    "selftext": "I am reading through Killing Hope by William Blum. In Ch. 1 P. 27 he states that there is \"compelling evidence\" showing in 1955, the CIA in collaboration with the US Army conducted experiments by releasing whooping-cough in Florida. Blum's source is a Washington Post article whoses source is the Church of Scientology. I almost always don't trust anything Scientologists say, so is anyone aware of a more credible source on this event?\n\nIt's certainly something I see as being possible but would like to have a source that's actually trustworthy. According to the Washington post article there were CIA reports that showed a link to the event but as far as I could find those documents are not public.",

            "body": "Finding sources on the cia is hard unless they decide its time to come clean like with mkultra or irans coup. There's so many things that are likely tied to the cia, but evidence can't be compiled and anyone who has complete evidence usually dies under mysterious circumstances or gets blackmailed. Ask Gary Webb. We know the cia was the actual motivator and actor behind cointelpro, not some rogue illegal police force. Can we prove it? Well are we alive rather than found facedown in a dumpster? Then no we can't prove it.\n\n\nIt's likely this behavior and these operations continue at this day. Not only that but it's likely cointelpro has expanded to be a larger subtle pyschological war.\n\nIn Germany they called it Zersetzung. \n\n\nGerman for \"decomposition\" and \"disruption\", this was a\u00a0psychological warfare\u00a0technique used by the\u00a0Ministry for State Security\u00a0(Stasi) to repress\u00a0political opponents\u00a0in\u00a0East Germany\u00a0during the 1970s and 1980s.\u00a0Zersetzung\u00a0served to combat alleged and actual dissidents through\u00a0covert\u00a0means, using secret methods of\u00a0abusive control\u00a0and\u00a0psychological manipulation\u00a0to prevent anti-government activities. Among the defining features of it was the widespread use of\u00a0offensive counterespionage\u00a0methods as a means of repression. People were commonly targeted on a pre-emptive and preventive basis, to limit or stop activities of political dissent and cultural incorrectness that they may have gone on to perform, and not on the basis of crimes they had actually committed.\" (This is currently going on in America against the left and Palestinians)\n\n\nAnother strategy is called a strategy of tension. This is meant to encourage mass random and fascist violence in a society to create a culture of fear and authoritarianism. We see this unfurling in american society right now, and anyone who had evidence to show us that this strategy of tension is what drives a lot of acts of mass murder would suddenly become suicidal. There's some mass casualty events in America that have happened under down right questionable circumstances, while others have been promoted to occur slyly whilst appearing as an organic problem.",

See [Operation Big Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Buzz).\n\nThe year prior, they also had released hundreds of thousands of fleas onto their own citizens for [Operation Big Itch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Itch).\n\nOne thing i would mention though, is that the US Government raided the Church Of Scientology in the 70's and found extensive evidence that they had been stealing Government documents for quite some time...",
