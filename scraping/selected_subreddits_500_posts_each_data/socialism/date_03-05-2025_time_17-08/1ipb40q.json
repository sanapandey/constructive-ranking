Is this transitioning from the feds normal \"joint task force\" terror units targeting certain activists, to them gearing up to include anyone who makes comments against them with the same level of repression active organizers face. It's sadly already normal for a seasoned marxist or anarchist to be under heavy threat of survelliance by groups like ICE but it is not normal for a soccer mom who said something as simple as \"maybe they took it too far here\".

Part of me thinks nothing of it, another part thinks they followed me and didn't expect me to be checking wifi consistently as I was on the move. I didn't see anything strange on the trip until I had to make a uturn I did see what looked like a caravan of fed cars but I didn't make the connection at the time. My friend said it sounds like they put an alert out when you left the state and followed you tbh. Later it was leaked ICE was for sure in the city I lived in spying on activists with fbi and dea.",
