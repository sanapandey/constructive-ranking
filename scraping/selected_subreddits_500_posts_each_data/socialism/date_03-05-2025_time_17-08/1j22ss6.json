    "selftext": "Currently, people pay private landlords money in order to have access to a location. The value of the location is not (completely) created by them, so why are people paying them the full price for it? Instead, 100% of this location value should be returned to the people that live there, not the landlords. \n\nAll land should be owned by society, through the government, and then leased out to the people that are willing and able to pay the price for it. That money should be put towards infrastructure in that location.",
