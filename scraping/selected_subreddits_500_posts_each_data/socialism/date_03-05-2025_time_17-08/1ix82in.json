    "selftext": "I'm an immigtant in a new city, and I want to socialize with socialists here in person.\n\nWay too many systematic issues are getting worse and worse every year, month, week, even day now.\n\nI am on the fence in regards of political ideologies, so I was hoping to learn and connect to people who share my concerns.\n\nSocialists tend to relate to my values.\n\nIs there a catalog of communities, or types of shared activities, where I could meet more socialists?\n\nI live in Lisbon nowadays, I'm here for only 4 months. Wasn't able to find anyhing online either. I don't speak Portuguese yet, sadly, at least on a conversational level.",
