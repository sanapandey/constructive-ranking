The Tlatelolco Massacre was a pretty significant moment in this movement.\n\nHad to read about it for some classes but the book titles are escaping me. I'm sure you could find some good ones at your school or public library.",

I was taught a lot of the history through these existing currents in America. Even down to the chants you hear in America when police kill, \"Cops pigs murderers\" (a chant from greece) it shows a certain side of american society watched that tiny nation in revolt from afar. Even interviews with people at demonstrations against police in suburban Missouri (ferguson) say they learned their tactics from watching places like Greece.",

But at least we were crucial at smashing the Neonazi party (golden dawn) that had started gaining considerable popular support",

This acheivement is spreading lessons around the world, and politically developing many groups and individuals in greece. The struggle is incessant, but the social ruptures come in waves. The success, and shortcomings of these brief moments in history are lessons that carry us into the future. Defeating golden dawn is a major victory by the way. Look at the surrounding nations where the neo fascist parties were not destroyed such as Italy.",
