Had it for 4 years now.\n\nIt's merch from the YouTube channel \"Some More News\" with Cody Johnston, and it's still available last I checked, in case anyone interested. \n\nThe channel has really good, educational, and funny content regarding wtf is going on in the world, and in US politics in particular. \n\nIt's a bit off-beat and *very* sarcastic, but that's right up my alley.",
