Guaranteed employment, housing, etc was ripped away from people. State industries were privatized and civil society was eroded. Price controls were abolished and various services people came to take for granted and depend on were scrapped. This is the backdrop which gave rise to the AFD, they\u2019re able to pin people\u2019s suffering on immigrants and minority populations",

It means worker's rights are fucked. Immigrants and marginalised groups are fucked.\n\n\n20% voted for diet-Nazi.
