Poverty harms black people worse than anything else, so it makes sense to form coalitions with others on the basis of our identity as workers so that we can undermine poverty among black people. All the other social and cultural stuff will be assisted by that and we can fight social and cultural battles through rhetoric.",

The gains have been mostly cultural, representative, and linguistic with very little real effect on underlying structural and institutional racism. Why? Because it serves as an illusory way of achieving democratic progress without actually addressing the needs of working people.

This is one root cause for racism. \n\nSystematic racism on the other hand is fueled by capitalism; the European colonists who arrived in the US took natives and Africans as slaves as a means of accumulating capital; working bodies with minimal agency that would provide free labor, or could be traded. It was an absurdly cruel system (and the fact that the 14th amendment still allows slave labor from prisoners is absolutely vile). It took a very, very long time for black people to be considered citizens and obtain voting and property ownership rights the same as white people, causing them to be a longterm \u201cunderclass\u201d. The New Deal didn\u2019t even provide the same benefits to people of color\u2014 it was pre-Civil Rights era. \n\nDue to these factors among many others, the US has a history of forcing impoverished conditions upon black people. So yes, racism can be a result of capitalism because it has been historically and currently remains a feature of the system. But originally, racism came from tribalism and mistrust\u2014 such as the Europeans thinking themselves superior, often being driven by faith or wealth of resources or some other bias towards their own way of life\u2014 or the most obvious one being skin color. \n\nDismantling capitalism can dismantle the systematic and economic oppression, but addressing racism socially requires more of a social revolution than a strictly economic or political one, otherwise we\u2019re damned to repeat the same mistakes or have the new system co-opted by racists. So I echo the sentiment of the others in this thread who\u2019ve said that racism and class struggle need to be addressed in tandem",

Here are some points that highlight this importance:\n\n1. Racism is a historic tool of capitalism to divide the working class and justify exploitation. It is a task, combating racism is essential to unify the oppressed and strengthen the anti-capitalist struggle. Racial oppression cannot be overcome without destroying the system that supports it.\n\n2. Gender, racial, sexual and class oppressions are interconnected. Ignoring this intersectionality means leaving important sectors of the working class aside. We must defend that the socialist struggle must incorporate the demands of women, the LGBTQIA+ population, indigenous peoples and other oppressed groups, understanding that their liberation is an inseparable part of the liberation of all humanity.\n\n3. The anti-racist and anti-capitalist struggle has a global character. It is necessary to come out in defense of internationalism, recognizing that racial oppression and capitalist exploitation are global phenomena, requiring a coordinated and solidary response among peoples.\n\n4. The construction of democratic socialism requires the active participation of all oppressed sectors. It is impossible to achieve emancipation without ensuring that black people, women, LGBTQIA+ and other marginalized groups have a voice and power in the political struggle.\n\n5. While reformist and Stalinist sectors can treat anti-racist and intersectional issues in isolation, we must insist that these struggles must be connected to overcoming capitalism. Believing that only a radical transformation of the system can eradicate structural oppression.\n\nIn short, anti-racist and intersectional struggle is not an \u201caddition\u201d to the class struggle, but an essential part of it. Building a world without oppression requires uniting all fronts of resistance, articulating them in a revolutionary project that combats capitalism in its multiple dimensions.",

I am a Latin American trans woman in the US. I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m the one you need to be giving a lecture on privilege over when I already have faced discrimination and harassment on the basis of what I look like, and being part of an ethnicity where some of my immediate vicinity is surrounded by people being targeted by the mass deportations currently happening in America while also having loved ones who are afraid that their papers might be taken away because of birthright. By all means, in that second aspect, I\u2019m privileged enough to not be the one personally targeted by either of these infringements on civil rights, but I am not one to demean or diminish what the people around me are feeling right now.\n\nIf anything, you\u2019re proving me right here getting caught up in the weeds of what my choice of verbiage was over the spirit of the point I\u2019m trying to get across. Somehow, we\u2019re moving this conversation into a \u201cyou\u2019re too privileged\u201d position when I am a person already educated on the idea of privilege and already charitable toward making sure every group of people has what it needs in order to survive and be given room at the table.\n\n\n>Capitalists certainly take advantage of different kinds of discrimination to keep the working class divided, but they did not create them out of thin air.\n\nNo, but they certainly exacerbated the issue in a way that previous societies did not have to face.\n\n>Discrimination has been a part of human history long before capitalism was a thing and we must be careful not to let it infiltrate our own movement.\n\nRight, but I\u2019m not the one pushing it into the movement when the only thing I care about is what is good for the proletariat as a whole. The worst I have on my end to admit is that the word \u201cdistraction\u201d may or may not have been the best word to describe the relationship between class and race struggle, but I\u2019m not one to feel like I have to step back from it when you and I both know what I meant by that at this point.",
