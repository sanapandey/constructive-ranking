Politically, I\u2019m more aligned with PSL, but practically, I don\u2019t have the time at the moment to be as involved as I should be for such a serious organization. DSA is appealing because it\u2019s larger, it\u2019s a big tent where line struggle is active, and involvement would be more manageable in the short term. If possible, I\u2019d like to join DSA asap, then join PSL when I\u2019m more available. Any thoughts or recommendations would be welcome!",

I've asked both orgs and they don't care about dual memberships at least at the local level. Nationally I'm sure both have policies about dual carding but who cares. I'm agnostic as to which 3 letter socialist org is going to end up as the one to mass organize the people, as long as we're working towards that goal is all that matters. PSL and DSA both serve similar but different roles so I think they both matter, and are both worth getting involved with if you have the bandwidth.",
