    "selftext": "For context I'm in Europe. I have only found one group and it meets quite far away from me. I want to know how you guys find leftist and socialist groups to meet and organize with in person. Love engaging with y'all online but would love to bring this engagement into real world settings. Are there specific forums/keywords/in person \"adverts\" I should look for ? ",

Some groups will have regional meetings if the membership is very spread out- that is still worth getting involved with if the politics are good.\u00a0 then you can plan out traveling for deliberate local actions",

Also, what I notice is I find pages on facebook but realize they haven't posted in over a year so they seem not to be active? I had luck finding one organziation but I'm waiting for them to \"approve\" me to join their chat lol",
