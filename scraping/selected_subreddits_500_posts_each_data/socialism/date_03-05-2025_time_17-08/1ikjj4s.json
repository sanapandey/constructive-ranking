    "selftext": "The theorist Benjamin Studebaker proposes the idea of a para party in order to circumvent the two party system and create a viable third party.\n\nHe suggests running the party's candidates as both Republicans and Democrats. They could be disciplined by a democratic centralist internal structure. I know the idea of socialists running as Republicans sounds strange, but it may be necessary to gain support from rural voters and win gerrymandered red districts. What do y'all think about this as an alternative to relying upon electoral reform to establish a third party?",

Jonah Kuhio couldn't contest The power of the Big Five within the Republicans, and David Kawananakoa, despite *founding* the Democratic Party of Hawaii, made no progress on Hawaiian autonomy. Similarly, African Americans were momentarily powerful when firmly united with the Republicans in the Reconstruction period and again after the Great Migration and joining the New Deal coalition. The days when theit political power was more evenly distributed maps rather nearly with the nadir of American racial relations. At the same time, the Populist uprisings of the 1890s nominated Bryan on the Democratic side and successfully won power in North Carolina with the Republicans, and were suppressed in *both* parties.\n\n2. Studebaker underestimates the power and flexibility of white supremacy as a mobilizing myth and a tool for reinforcing class solidarity - first with the Democrats, and then with the Republicans.\n\nWith both of these in mind, I turn to what I think *would* (and in fact, is happening with working-class formations attempting a para-party strategy:\n\n3. If you're already a junior partner in one party, you'll be halved if you try to compete in two. Even in gestures (rather than full commitment to play in both party primaries, labor finds itself diminished - the Teamsters, despite prime time at the RNC, found their own internal cohesion divided over a \"no endorsement\" *on what appear to be white/nonwhite lines* and the unions supporting the Democrats find themselves betrayed in the latters' defeat with Manchin and Sinema blocking fortification of labor's primary bastions in the administrative state (the FTC, the NLRB).\n\nThe use of the color line to disorganize labor and to organize a white man's party (under different names in different eras, but currently MAGA) is the primary barrier to the workers' movement being competitive in one party, much less two.\n\nIt *is* an interesting change to previous historical proposals - the independent third party, alliance fully with one or the other. But it's also been tried; the AFL prior to 1932's \"reward friends and punish enemies, regardless of party\" could be considered a predecessor of this phenomenon.",

I'm not sure this is really the case. There has been a shift away from the Democrats among minorities. I believe the modern divide is more along gender lines than ethnic lines.\n\nCertainly, Trump's current administration is even worse than I expected. I'm not sure to what extent this extremism has influenced the entire party, such as at the local level. I would have to do more research on this.\n\nI really think the demographic divide worth focusing on is the division between college and non-college educated workers. Non-college educated workers are more likely to be republican, or to be honest, don't participate in politics. College educated workers, most of which are not elites, tend to be pro republican. Among the elites, there is a split between business owning petty bourgeois and bureaucratic political petty bourgeoisie. I think the idea would be to split both parties among class lines.\n\nMaybe the split would end up with the para party running more Democrats, but I think this strategy would still balance the parties a bit (preventing the spoiler effect).\n\nThe para party may not be a permanent strategy. Perhaps, the para party implements some minimum program which includes electoral reform. Once that reform is established, the party can form it's own ballot line and establish formal independence from both parties.",

The Republicans are still, as of right now, a white man's party - just because they are emphasizing the \"man\" doesn't mean they've abandoned the 'white.'\n\nAnd, seeing as the average American worker is non white and a woman - as likely a Filipina CNA, a Mexican dishwasher or a Black teachers aide or hotel housekeeper - a gender split would create the same strategic complication; namely, that the Republicans are practicing a politics of gender (rather than racial) suppression that disorganized working people *and disproportionately targets working people* - namely, there's one party that is clearly more anti-worker than the other.\n\n>I'm not sure to what extent this extremism has influenced the entire party, such as at the local level.

Then they increased cop budgets and built cop cities. The only tangible victory from that was the Amazon Tax in Seattle funding public housing, spurred by a working class movement, led by socialists like Kshama Sawant. Then and today Seattle Democrats were fighting to curtail those funds.\n\n\n\nThere are some DSA electeds that have gotten local office thru the Democratic Party, and the reason they're allowed in is because they pose no threat to it. But yes AOC is a great example. I don't think most people understand or care whether DSA has formal attachment to her office. Many left groups including DSA continually boost her as the most prominent young progressive. And she's taking working class politics nowhere.\u00a0\n\n\nThe strategy of being inside a billionaire party is a dead end for workers. Socialists should not be in the business of whitewashing the Democratic Partys record\u00a0of imperialism, austerity and militarizing brutal cops.",

Both the major parties are incredibly disciplined when it comes to obeying capital, and both are extremely unpopular with the american people and basically only get votes by threatening voters with the other. On the former point; we can look at DSA's short-lived success and then total isolation as evidence that you can't take over one of the parties. I don't see any reason running in both parties instead of just 1 would improve this situation. On the latter, the burden of proof is on him to prove that the socialist movement benefits more from association with these rotten bourgeois parties everyone hates than it hurts. That's a tall order.\n\nA third issue I just thought of, also borne out by DSA, is that no one has successfully demonstrated that your tiny young movement can exercise any amount of discipline, let alone democratic centralism, on these politicians once they have bootstrapped their way into the major party's donor list and machine.\n\nI think with this idea you're likely to get a bunch of liberals mad, saying DSA's strategy with the dems can work but republicans are a non-starter. They're wrong too, not because the dems can be taken over but because both parties are a dead end. They are both structurally designed to only be able to move rightward.",

We shouldn't just try to map his situation onto ours directly, we need to understand the method.\n\nI fully believe in democratic centralism, but it's a specific tool for a specific problem. All you would get by enforcing communist discipline within a bourgeois party is expelled from that party; which IMO explains the DSA electeds' records more than pure careerism.\n\nOh yeah, American mainstream \"parties\" are nothing like classical political parties with memberships, I think that's a big misconception. Both parties have like 10000 members, they have no people power and 100% of their actions are what their donors want. The dems \"fail\" to \"fight\" the right but have iron discipline in fighting the left. Together they control all media Americans consume, and the second any political position emerges outside one of the major parties they use a hybrid strategy to simultaneously demonize and coopt it. To an American, anything even resembling a European parliamentary democracy would be indistinguishable from socialism.",
