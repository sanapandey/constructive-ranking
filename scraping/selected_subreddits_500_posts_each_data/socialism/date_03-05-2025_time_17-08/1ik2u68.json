    "selftext": "This is entirely based on a personal anecdote so I don't know if it's accurate but it seems socialists tend to become less hopeful over time (and often for good reason). As someone newer to the movement I feel this immense, somewhat irrational hope at the prospect of a solution. Although there was always \"capitalism sucks\", the fact of a pragmatic alternative is brilliant to new leftists. Despite this reality it seems as time goes on, the average hope experienced goes down - yet this is confusing to me. From an objective perspective nothing has changed that is really stopping what I can do on a local level and while there may be setbacks, people become socialists all the time and experience that new hope. So why can't you or future me be?  \n  \nHope for the best and be prepared for the worst.",
