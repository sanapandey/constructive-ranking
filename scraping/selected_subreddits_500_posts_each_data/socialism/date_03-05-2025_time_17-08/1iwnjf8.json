Michael Heinrich has a decent *Introduction to the Three Volumes of Capital* that can help fit some of the pieces together.\n\nAlso remember that Volumes 2 & 3 were largely unfinished and cobbled together by Engels. Not saying they\u2019re not worth reading\u2026but be prepared.",

Once you hit chapter 4 it's much more compelling since it starts dealing with \"normal\" things like wages and overtime and productivity and all those things we're familiar with in real life.",
