    "selftext": "The bottom 50% of Americans own almost nothing. That hasn\u2019t changed since the 19th century.\n\nMeanwhile, the top 10% now control nearly 50% of all wealth.\n\nAnd yet, we\u2019re still told to just \u201cwork harder.\u201d\n\nIf generational wealth was really going to \u2018spread\u2019 naturally, we would have seen it happen by now. But we haven\u2019t\u2014because this system is designed to hoard wealth at the top while keeping the rest of us fighting for scraps.\n\nThe top 1% have seen their wealth skyrocket since the 1980s, while wages for the working class have barely moved.\n\nThe idea that \u201ceveryone just needs to pull themselves up\u201d is a myth\u2014because how can you pull yourself up when you have nothing to start with?\n\nWhen you own nothing, you have to accept everything.\nAny wage. Any job conditions. Any rent price. Because you have no leverage.\nThe rich don\u2019t just own wealth\u2014they own choices.\n\nAnd this is why redistribution isn\u2019t about \u2018handouts\u2019\u2014it\u2019s about power. If you have a small property, a basic income, or an inheritance, suddenly, you have choices. You can refuse jobs that exploit you. You can start a business. You can buy a home. You don\u2019t have to accept survival wages just to get by.\n\nI\u2019ve worked warehouse jobs. I\u2019ve been one of the top order pullers at Gerson. In a single shift, I could personally move $70,000 worth of product out the door. That warehouse alone makes close to a million dollars a day.\n\nAnd yet, workers barely see a fraction of that wealth.\n\nThe richest corporations are pulling in record-breaking profits, yet wages haven\u2019t budged.\n\nThey could pay us more. They could offer better conditions. They just don\u2019t.\nThis isn\u2019t about economics. It\u2019s about control. Because when you have nothing, you can\u2019t afford to say no.\n\nA fair system is one that guarantees:\n\u2714 Universal access to basic needs\u2014education, healthcare, housing, retirement.\n\u2714 A minimum inheritance for all\u2014just like in France, where a proposed \u20ac120,000 (or $180,000 in the U.S.) would be given to every adult at 25.\n\u2714 Progressive wealth taxes\u2014ensuring billionaires pay their fair share to fund public services.\n\nIf you think this is radical, ask yourself\u2014why is it \u2018normal\u2019 for billionaires to hoard money they\u2019ll never use, while millions struggle to survive?\n\nI keep hearing that \u2018this isn\u2019t something City Council can fix.\u2019 Maybe they can\u2019t fix everything, but let\u2019s be real\u2014they control more than you think.\n\nOlathe PD chooses who gets locked up, who gets fined, and who gets ignored.\n\nLocal zoning laws decide who can afford housing and who gets pushed out.\n\nCity budgets prioritize where taxpayer money goes\u2014policing or social services? Infrastructure or corporate tax breaks?\nDon\u2019t let them tell you they\u2019re powerless. They choose their priorities every day. The question is\u2014who are they prioritizing?\n\nThe facts are there. The numbers don\u2019t lie.\nExpose the truth. Bring these numbers to light. Make people uncomfortable with reality.\nFight for policy change. Demand livable wages, labor protections, and corporate accountability.\nRefuse to accept this as normal",
