    "selftext": "Most mainstream media outlets are right-wing, or at least heavily biased due to reporting through the lens of Western capitalism. I'm so sick of seeing every headline and news report being laden with pro-Capitalist, pro-Imperialist, anti-Communist, anti-labor spin. I would LOVE suggestions for where to get my news (website, print, any format really) that are either from a leftist perspective, or that at least plainly present factual world news and current events from accurate sources. Thank you in advance!",

They coalesce multiple outlets\u2019 coverages of a single topic, and I think there\u2019s some things that certain anti-capitalist outlets are less likely to cover whether because of bias or irrelevance to their message. \n\nFor example, a lot of right wing media outlets were reporting on AOC calling Musk the most unintelligent billionaire. It\u2019s of questionable relevance or importance but it\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t know was getting attention without Ground News. Sometimes it\u2019s good to keep track of meta narratives like this. \n\nThey do include Democracy Now! as a source among a few other anti-capitalist ones I\u2019ve seen sprinkled throughout, though, so it\u2019s not exclusively capitalist media. They claim to pull from 50,000 different sources, so I\u2019d imagine there\u2019s a larger population of pro-capitalist media in English",
