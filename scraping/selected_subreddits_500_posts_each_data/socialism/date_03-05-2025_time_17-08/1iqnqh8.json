    "selftext": "What the fuck happened to the workers (and peasants) emancipation movements. All the unions act as economic cartels and they only have there own interests in mind.\n\nWe need to wake up and decide what kind of society we want to live in. The world powers are shifting and this leaves a great opportunity for radicalization.\n\nWe NEED workers and poor people to wakeup to fact that the entire state apparatus is the problem. It feeds off your toil. Any measly concession is almost immediately outpaced by inflation rendering it useless.\n\nWe CANNOT live or cooperate with this neo-reactionary vs neo-liberal shitscape we find ourselves in. It's a battle we have fuck all to do with yet it's going to crush us the most.\n\nAll I'm saying is reformism has to go. We have to Believe in our hearts that the collectives and communes are coming. Liberty and equality will reign supreme when the people of this world reclaim their autonomy.\n\nAlso unions should be pushing hard IWW rhetoric. Fuck this shit we want the entire economy. We, the toilers will do as we please with our wealth and govern our own affairs.\n\nThe point is to completely abolish the capitalist system to basically create a thriving society of human flourishing.\n\nWe need to come together as ANGRY pisses off working class MILITANTS. They are fucking fleecing us dry whilst they collect billions.\n\nRevolution NOW.\n\nStart pumping out zines, flood the internet with radicalized and militant shit. We need to be here because revolution is with us. We WILL get it.",

They're basically a fetishitic clique, and from what I've seen, the real life manifestations of North American movements are nothing more than social cliques with their own host of unofficial hierarchical social mechanisms and an \"in group, out group\" dynamics.\n\n\nThat's to say,\nWe are in the shit.",

So instead of spreading, and building larger networks, people are basically meeting based upon \"common interest in political theory\" and acting. Rather than meeting upon common interest in class and developing praxis and theory with completely new people. Too much happens within the framework of professional activism and not enough actual community based resistance. Even the militant demonstrations in America which we've never seen before in this era. What happens after? Do the individuals go back to their comfortable lives, or their daily routine of being subordinates to property? Where was the survival programs or resistance to property that could be sustained? America was on fire, yet at that time I still could barely eat, and poverty increased and has increased.",

Direction action is the most important thing one can do.\n\n\nAn \"armchair analysis\" isn't \"wrong\" perse, but we can save that energy for the workers/peasants councils when we establish them. In our current context left-wing bickering is just internet \"gotcha\" games that rely on annoying the opponent and not sparking ideas or contemplation. It's a remnant of the capitalist mindset that has to go.\n\n\nWhat's most import at this time is not creating material for us who are already well entwined with the emancipation of all poor and working class individuals (Indeed all of humanity and beyond), it's the unrelenting propaganda machine we should be pushing out in order to counteract the brain rot.\n\n\nI'm not talking about copy pasted material from your favorite contemporary option pieces, I'm talking excerpts from the older comrades who know class struggle and original contributions from the heart, not remixed from the contemporary Marxism you find within this youthful antifa crowd.",
