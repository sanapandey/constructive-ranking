    "selftext": "Is she a Dengist or a glorified social democrat? Is her book a good resource on learning about China? She does seem to be very supportive of Dengism and its sucess as an alternative to American capitalism. But she does purpose further market reforms in the financial sector. So it seems she really is wanting an Asian Nordic Model. Is this fair? I haven\u2019t read it yet. Is it worth reading?",

I liked it specifically because it\u2019s one of the few English-language books that have gotten wide release, but are not dogmatic, and give you some actual insight into how things are playing out here.",
