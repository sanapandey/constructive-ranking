Gutting the CIA essentially deletes all of the institutional knowledge, contacts and operational infrastructure that the Agency established over its history. \n\nThen you get to the staffing, Trump and his crew are putting the least intelligent , most unqualified people in leadership positions. How well do you think someone like Mike Lindell would run a clandestine organization or maintain a long term plan to destabilize political movements over the long term across several continents? How effective can a MAGA cultist be in an Agency were individual capability is of the highest import and knowledge of the minutia of a region and it's languages, sects and political history are a prerequisite? \n\nTrump may have inadvertently given the global leftist movement some breathing room amidst his rampage of destruction.",

Running espionage isn't cheap. It's pretty funny to see neoliberalism eat away at the defenses of the capitalist class too. There is no end to the greed of the capitalists, they will even strip away the bones of their own defenses to save money and increase profits. \n\nSome self-owns have already happened, BTW. A few years back, a bunch of CIA agents in China and Iran foreign nationals who were working for the CIA, not CIA officers) were uncovered because rather than relying on time tested (and expensive) means of communication (like dead drops, etc.) The CIA decided to use some \"secure\" app that some tech bro sold them on. The Iranians hacked into it, were able to monitor all communications and handed it over to the Chinese. Dozens of agents/informants were rounded up and executed.",

Global south countries aren\u2019t \u201cforced\u201d into capitalism nor is the CIA some all magic wizard that is keeping global south countries from becoming socialist.\n\n\nYes US imperialism is a primary contradiction is the development of the global south living standards but there is still class struggle present between global south bourgeois and proletariat and the international bourgeois and comprador bourgeois, US imperialism ending doesn\u2019t preclude a socialist world. The US didn\u2019t create capitalism nor is it the sole maintenance of it\n\nThis is a very idealistic and outright revisionist way of describing geopolitics",
