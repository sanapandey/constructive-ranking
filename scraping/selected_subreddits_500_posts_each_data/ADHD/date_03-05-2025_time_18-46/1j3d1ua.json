I was fine with that. But now, the tolerance is killing my productivity, and I\u2019m struggling every day. I feel exhausted. Burned out.\n\nI can\u2019t afford to take a break because I can\u2019t lose my job (which is a low-paying dead-end job)\n\nIs there any way to reset my tolerance and get back on track? I hate that my brain gave me false hope.\n\n",

            "body": "I don't take on the weekends (my days off), nor on any holidays.\u00a0I don't know for certain if it helps at all with tolerance, but anecdotally I feel much better taking a break from them occasionally. Also, I don't like the meds. I'm used to and I like the noise my brain makes, but for my job I need to be productive so I take Adderall.\n\n\nI've been on the medication for three years now, and I haven't hit a wall on its effectiveness. How long have you been on the meds? It's possible that what you think is tolerance is really just the initial \"high\" before growing accustomed to the prescription?\n\n\nWhen I first started taking my meds, the novelty of being able to think more linearly made work enjoyable--so I had a huge productivity surge. Eventually that wore off and I started screwing up again at work, and had to develop steps in keeping myself accountable in doing my job.\n\n\nYou say burned out. Is it possible you're depressed? ADHD meds can mask depression, especially when you first start taking them. Do you talk to a therapist regularly, or just a PsyD for med management? If just med management, maybe you should speak to a therapist.\n\n\nHope this helps.",
