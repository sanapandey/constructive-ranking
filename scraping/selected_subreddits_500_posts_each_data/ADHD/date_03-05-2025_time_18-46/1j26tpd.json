    "selftext": "So unexpected effect of my ADHD meds - I'm suddenly super aware of all the clutter and chaos around me. Cleaning out my purse today was a real eye-opener... 15 lipsticks just chillin' in there. Guess my meds are helping me see the mess my mind was unable to see. Not sure if that makes sense or is super obvious but thought I\u2019d share. ",

That just never goes away. I had been thinking prior to being diagnosed/medicated the ringing in my ears was from alit of dental work and my jaw being miss aligned or tmj but questing that now after the volume has gone down with the adhd meds. It\u2019s also making me only want \u201chealthy ish foods\u201d compared to my previously unhealthy foods. It\u2019s been life altering so far as soon as I can make it through the day/evening without a crash at 12-2pm depending on what time I take meds in the morning it would probably be life changing for the best.",
