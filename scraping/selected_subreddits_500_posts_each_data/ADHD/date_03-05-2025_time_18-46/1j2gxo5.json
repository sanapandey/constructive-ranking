I find it hard to work with other people and I struggle with understanding tasks I need to do. Is there any job that is easy and wouldn\u2019t be stressful for someone like me? ",

Good thing though, it's usually fairly obvious what we like. We've got strong preferences. \n\nBut for those who like to dishy dashy between things (I've struggled with this, went from clothing design -> music -> psychology -> IT, in regards to interests i want to persue) there's usually a common theme. For example, I like to build things, and problem solve. I also enjoy freedom within structure. \n\nJust as an aside, as a millennial, we were sold the idea that everyone has their one true path. This is not true, do not fall for it. For us that brings doubt, decision paralysis and ultimately we rot and burn out if we let it take over. Heed the warning. There is more than one way to do life.\n\nAnyway, bottom line...It's absolutely down to your personal preference. Find that shit, we flourish.\n\nedit: just another thought... In my own personal experience, I got super disheartened when I did find my thing that I like, but there was an aspect of it I disliked... Do not overthink this. There will always be something you dislike about the thing you enjoy... It sounds simple, but I just wanted to put that out there, because this halted my progress, and made me second guess everything up to that point. I hope my commet helps @OP, you're at the perfect age to explore. Also, take advantage of support networks, they are there to assist you to cut through the bullshit.",

I discovered this through working at a non-profit where I did everything but finances, then working for an IT company doing phone systems & computer repair, and eventually getting into the hardware portions of credit card processing. Then into Hardware support for software company (servers, network, CC processing), to consultant around the technical aspects of the software, then to creating a beta team and process, and now into Product Management.\n\nMaintenance is boring to me. Through the whole process of different jobs, what I liked was figuring out what the customer needed, getting it built, installed, and training them on it, then moving on and letting someone else handle the maintenance, on-going/regular troubleshooting, etc.",

Because we are always in danger of burnout, especially if we care deeply about our work (which I think is good for our long term happiness!).

I also hyperfixate on 1-2 games for a long period of time. \n\nThe 2 I listed above have been the only ones I've played for like 2 months straight. I can't really think of any good habits I have in-game. I've been stuck in the gold-plat ranks of RL for like 3 years now because I'm driven almost entirely by motivation. The second I start losing I get tilted and start playing terrible, which leads to a downward spiral until I quit the game for a week and don't get enough practice to improve. \n\nOn the other side of the coin I get super amped up when I win and sometimes go on 7 game long winning streaks if I get lucky during my first few warm-up games, idk what to take away from that though. \n\nUnlike you I've never been very organized or good at setting up systems. I would know this from when I used to be obsessed with Minecraft. Everything goes in the big chest in the corner, no organization, too much work lol.\n\nI guess one thing that I'm decent at is working around my teammates. In rl I'm usually the one to save the ball from going in the net while everyone else is mindlessly ball-chasing, and I'm decent at catching my teammates' mistakes and turning them it into free goals. In Helldivers I use the quick chat like every 2 seconds to try and coordinate everyone, but I'm a huge introvert irl.",

Get some nice looking night or dusk/dawn images of a newly finished project. Check with Architecture, Construction and Developer / Real Estate firms, I bet this would be a good gig with a lot of variety.\n\nOh and the seasonal Alaska work. I have family in Juneau AK, tourism needs guides, there's whale watching and helicopter tours to name two that I know of.

They have 100's of different specialties that you can focus on, your knowledge will carry over while still being challenged. \n\nI started out in residential, moved to restaurant refrigeration, back to resi cause of covid, then to supermarket refrigeration, and im now a controls engineer. \n\nTo get into this industry, you dont need to go to school. Write up a resume, dont submit it online. Google residential hvac companies in your area. Find there office and go there. Ask to speak to the install manager. Make sure you get their number. If they dont give you a job on the spot, call them twice a week. Tuesday and thursday 10am on the dot. \n\nYoull have a job within a month or 2. Now heres the shitty part. Residential install sucks. Its shit work for shit pay. Youll probably get started out at 12-15hr. Now heres how you can break 200k within 5 years. Pick up that installation manual. Read it front to back, side to side, hell, even upside down. Anyway to learn every word in that book. Youtube every video possible on hvac, and thermodynamics. Learn how we move heat with refrigerant. Move into commercial or get really good at sales. Those are the 2 ways to make 200k in 5 years. \n\nYou can also go into the union. Look for your local united association branch and apply for the apprenticeship. You'll hit journeyman wage in 5 years. I went the first route but i do hold my journeyman card.",

Every job will have struggles. I need a job that balances rigid structure and complete chaos.  I work in vineyards so there's so many different varieties and clones.  It's like being an adult and rediscovering the joy of pokemon by remembering so many different items and their unique traits.  I get to be social with sales and then spend a bunch of time by myself.  I have to have the rigid structure with daily/weekly responsibilities but my favorite part is that I'm always solving problems.  My lil ADHD brain sees the interconnectivity of many things that aren't obvious, so I get to let my brain do it's own thing while contributing naturally.  They say that we have interest based nervous systems.  Well it's very easy to teach others when you yourself are very interested in what you're teaching.  I've never been good with teaching in a normal sense, but I use metaphors a lot to get my point across (my favorite is that wine tasting is like guessing the flavor of jelly beans from one of those big Costco packs, and sometimes mixing different flavors tastes better).\n\nHope you find what's best for you OP.  I don't mean it in the cliche way, but once you discover what your passionate about, all the little nuances with ADHD become strengths that can make you the best at what you do.",

Sometimes you need to find the excitement in the job... or you may need to find the a job that gives you the leeway you need to do what you can. \n\nI am older, so now I'm in a career role as a project manager. This is a great job *for me* because it includes problem solving on giant projects and processes that need a map and someone to say \"this is important, can someone do it now!\" and also \"here's the best way to do this in the future.\"\n\nI saw a lot of this project management work in my previous jobs... and it was a thing I enjoyed very much. It is the problem solving part that I like. The environment helps too, because it is aligned with my values (higher education serving a diverse population).\n\nI've done jobs in the past where tried all sorts of things, like managing a froyo store (fun, but not rewarding), waiting tables (financially rewarding but not fun), factory work (soul crushing), retail sales (depended on the store, but higher end was fun for me because I could shop with other people's money, basically), web design (fun, challenging, but as a solo entrepreneur, too much responsibility for the parts of running a business and caused an utter meltdown), and admin work in different offices (really depends on the company, the values, and your coworkers!)\n\nThere is no best job for ADHD, but there is a best job for you. It also doesn't have to be your forever job! Think about what you do that makes you excited, and see if there are jobs that sound like that... or think about what you value... is there a job that maybe doesn't have the \"best\" work, but supports something that you love? \n\nThere are online tests to identify your values and strengths (IDRLabs has a lot of them for free) and can give you a sense of what matters to you. Then you can weigh them in the balance of what you need from a job. \n\nThe big thing to remember, OP, is that a job is just that. It is not you, your identity, or your value to the world. You might find a job that you love, or one that you tolerate, but it is most important to ensure that you can look yourself in the mirror at the end of the day and say \"yeah, today was good enough, and I am a good human.\" And if your job doesn't make you feel like that most days, then you need a different one. And switching jobs is stressful, but trust your gut if a place doesn't feel like a good fit.\n\nGood luck. You got this. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

But then you still have all those normal \"followups\" to catch up on when you have very little mental energy left for the day.  No you can't wait until \"lightning strikes\" for that energy, you have to be on top of all the accounts all the time.  Consistency is huge for sales and I simply am unable to work consistently.",

I thought I was broken as far as work goes. Always scored and performed well in both academics (tests) and performing arts (theatre), but had a hard time lasting longer than 12 weeks at anything. \n\nIt wasn't until age 32 that I finally found my niche. My job is extremely high-stress for very short periods of time, and generally flexible outside of that. I've found that this works well, as when things are \"on fire\" (not literally) I seem to perform my best.\n\nI also have narrowed my hobbies from literally everything to a few things I enjoy the most (piano, M:TG with friends irl, DnD, theatre, and tech projects).\n\nI just want to say that you're asking an important question at a young age. Don't give up. It's going to be really hard to get the good ADHD jobs as a youngin. Be aware that it is more important for us to consider WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY DOING (talking to people, problem solving, traveling frequently) in a given position than some ideological reasoning (i.e. \"I want to work with kids\", \"I want to help the planet\", etc). No matter how noble the cause is, you'll get burned out doing some repetitive mundane tasks day after day.\n\nFor a younger person, if you're a bit social, maybe look into being some kind of niche repair technician. I did IT warranty repair for a couple years and liked it a lot (except the pay). Everyday I had no idea where I would be going or who I'd meet next. Houses, businesses, government, parks, cruise ships. If they had machines, I'd go there to fix em. Work consisted of short (~1 hour) social interaction + problem solving, punctuated by stretches alone in the car driving to the next one. I didn't like driving a whole lot, but I loved all the audiobooks I crushed! I scheduled my own appointments for the day, so some days I'd get up early and knock em all out before noon. Other days I'd sleep in till 11 and take my sweet time. Worth considering \n\nTLDR: Find your niche, don't give up.\n\nPS I don't want to mention my current job (Tech), because I don't expect it to exist by the time OP would be educated + experienced enough to get it.",

A simple job with little oversight was perfect for me.

To each their own though.\n\nEdit: meant to add that this kind of job is good for OP who\u2019s 18 and probably isn\u2019t ready to jump into a full career.

It was challenging, I enjoyed anticipating potential problems and addressing them before they became issues, and at other times it was mind numbing monotony which gave me time to daydream or joke around with coworkers while still being productive. The variety was enjoyable. The fact that my boss could tell us if we could knock a job out fast we could get a full day's pay but be home by lunchtime was nice. I enjoyed taking waste from job sites and making shit with it. Like, I would never go purchase it, but if you're just gonna throw away 25 8' x 1/2\" stainless steel rods, I'll think of something to build with them. I did not enjoy wearing ugly work clothes and getting unbelievably dirty everyday. \n\nThat said, the money was inconsistent. I switched to software development testing over a decade ago and I find that also offers a variety of challenges, and the opportunity to learn new things a lot. The day is more consistent, but there's less direct supervision. I find it can be difficult to enforce structure on myself, so when I've been more independent I can get bored and not be very productive. I miss the sense of accomplishment that you get with construction, but I make a lot more money now. \n\nAt 18 I worked as a cook in a bar, as a clerk at a library, as a video store clerk, as a pots n pan washer in a cafeteria, and as a nude model for an art class. I made the best friends at the bar or the video store. You're only 18. Try 10 things and see what you're suited to. See who you like being around. At those places look at the people who've been there for ten years and ask yourself if that's the life you want. Ask them how their path led them there.

            "body": "In my experience (M30, ADHD-PI, 10 years in mainstream media/marketing), a good job for someone with ADHD is less about the field you work in and more about how you work. Here's a really loose list of criteria I use. You may find it helpful too: \n\n1. How much autonomy does the job offer? A lot of us don't do well with micromanagement, although there are exceptions (a surprising number of ADHDers seem to enjoy highly structured fields like the military). A job where you're given a task and told 'finish it on your own by X time, I don't care how you do it' is ideal for a lot of ADHDers. Many of us are self-employed, or work in occupations with considerable flexibility and control over our time. One of my ADHD friends works in the dairy department of a grocery store stocking shelves and never needs to interact with customers or employees. Another is a merchandiser for a jewelry company who restocks stores all over the city on her own.   \n  \n2. Does the job align with your interests? Generally speaking, ADHDers do better at jobs where we feel our work matters, or we're genuinely curious about what we do - even if other aspects of it suck. This might not be possible for you, but finding a job that fits with the stuff you're drawn to can really help you land (and stick with) a job. If you're a gamer, a local gaming store or board game cafe might be a great place to work. Or perhaps a landscaping job if you love nature or biology. It doesn't need to fit exactly, but having something about your job that draws you is a great way to stay motivated. \n\n3. Does the job clash with your weaknesses? If you're like me and struggle to sit through long meetings, handle complex bureaucratic processes, or deal with large teams of people, then it's probably best to avoid a job that require those things...even if it seems to align with your interests. I recently left journalism after years of careless errors, rejection sensitivity (I lived in fear of emails telling me I'd gotten something wrong), and constant flip-flopping between specializations. I still really respect the industry, but it wasn't for me anymore - even though I'm still a big news junkie. \n\n4. How specialized is the job? I've found a lot of ADHDers (including myself) struggle in monotonous or repetitive jobs. To use the merchandiser example from earlier - yes, my friend works for a jewelry company, so she's always re-stocking stores, but she also has to do a lot of other stuff: navigating the traffic-choked highways of my city, reorganizing display shelves, counting inventory, etc. There's always something new for her to do. By contrast, someone with ADHD may struggle in a job that demands consistent focus on one thing. I could never be a 'beat' reporter (aka someone who only covers a single issue, like politics or sports) because I'd get bored of it every few months. \n\nTL;DR - The best job for someone with ADHD is fairly flexible, aligns with your interests, and has little to no overlap with whatever you struggle to do. \n\nBest of luck!",

I\u2019m in Australia so not sure what it\u2019s like in the USA if that\u2019s where you\u2019re from, but the unions here do a bloody good job of making sure the construction workers are taken care of with insane penalty rates on top of an already good $ per hour (probably bc it\u2019s a male dominant field so they gotta make sure their boys are taken care of \ud83d\ude09 unlike female dominated industries) plus of course it can be dangerous and risk is higher so that plays into the good pay too but if you have a good head on your shoulders and common sense you will be fine and won\u2019t hurt yourself. Also you dont necessarily need to do a trade and get a certificate first bc at least in Australia if you start as a labourer, companies generally will pay for you to get certain certificates and if you\u2019re not looking to do it forever then just being a trade assistant will earn you good money anyways (like me)!

It\u2019s good for me for the moment for sure and I wish I started out younger and saved up until early twenties then started out into a career I\u2019m super \u201cpassionate\u201d about after setting myself up financially!

I am a college professor.  I don't do the same thing every day, and it all ends and resets every 16 weeks.  I can push through for 16, get 2-10 weeks off, and then do something similar again.  Even if I teach the same classes (I don't because most rotate), I at least get new students, which keeps it fresh.  If I get really burnt out, I can take a sabbatical or switch to a non-teaching position for a while.  I also recommend working with an ADHD coach when you start a job to learn what accommodations you need.  For example, I needed to have a paper and pen to answer the phone because if I didn't write it down, I would forget everything the second I put them on hold.  A coach can help you streamline those types of things.",

Short answer, a mix. \n\nOne entry/general skill as my primary for some steady income stability; every job has pros and cons, determine what you are ok/happy with, neutral with (big one), and what you definitely can\u2019t tolerate; you will find that a lot with blue collar work per my experience, as you work around different things and build craft skills no matter the job, to put it short and sweet. It pays the best comparable to entry retail, and it\u2019s a plus in the sense of some trade/labor work being more about the work at hand than people pleasing, but it depends how high you stick your nose; it\u2019s also generally more physical, demanding work. Don\u2019t jump right into a skilled trade/commit to a 2-4yr apprenticeship unless yk 1000% you\u2019re committing to that as a career, though sometimes trial and error is the best method; personally im taking this route because im too curious and my interests are very dynamic rn, but im entering a entry labor-based field that\u2019ll be around all of these crafts in real time, and around real people that can tell you how it is; usually these types of jobs have programs for getting into skilled trainings withing as well. \n\nAdditionally, a hobby-based job that you can explore at-will (putting as much or as little time as I want, be it a few hours on the weekend, or a few hours a day), with potential to build upon & grow as an investment\u2026 basically the safest way to see if i get the spark without job hopping, tanking my resume, delaying my career. This latter part is my way of exploring what potential high academic/skill paths appeal to me. I\u2019m considering research and other creative outlet-turned-hustle potentials. This could be anything from writing a book, to going to college part time/online, to starting a business, to repairing stuff. I recommend this because as personal experience with my dynamically changing interests, I started and failed with this, having jumped into college from high school, losing interest, and major-hopping numerous times until dropping out. I lost years of what could\u2019ve been invested income. I was physically/mentally unable to push myself through courses that fell out of my interest, or pursue majors that quickly stoped making sense to me. However, I was also undiagnosed at the time, and untreated; with no knowledge of adhd. There are vast professional resources that can help you succeed with adhd support should you have an interest in mind that yk you want to get into for the long term.\n\nP.S. Learn to advocate for yourself, best done with the help of professional resources/support. If you\u2019re a driven worker, you\u2019re valuable to the labor market (regardless of entry/experience per most entry jobs), and you can work with employers before hiring to discuss the dynamics of the job, how to fit in prior to the job, and how to adapt as you get into the swing of a job. There is a professional term called reasonable accommodations that are legally backed by the Americans with Disabilities Act for this very purpose, so you can do things properly, and communicate in an effective way. Otherwise (because I\u2019ve been through it myself), articulating or venting grievances to supervisors, coworkers, or (especially) HR can be unproductive, and drive you out from anything long term. So you can hypothetically request something for xyz as an accommodation (there is official paperwork of such requests) that you can submit, backing it with your supporting provider(s) to communicate such requests as reasonable.",

And I need to be able to work both independently, but also be part of a team. So that gives me an insane amount of options to choose from). Then looking into just about any industry you can think of and seeing what fits. \n\nBut mostly remember these are the beginning chapters of your book. You have so many lives left in front of you to love! If you can find something at this age that you don't hate that can be a sort of permanent back up job, it will make it less scary along the way.

They will love you and you will get a lot of satisfaction and self confidence from helping them.\n\nYou might need help from a supportive mentor to get you going and to keep you on track.\n\nGood luck! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
