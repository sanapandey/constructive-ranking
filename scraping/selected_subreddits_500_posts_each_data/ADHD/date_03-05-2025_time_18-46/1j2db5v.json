    "selftext": "I\u2019m wondering if there is a name for a pattern or habit I\u2019ve been going through. I tend to only really get things done when I am in a dangerous or uncomfortable situation. I\u2019m looking for more knowledge/understanding on this to help me get out of that habit.\n\nExample of this behavior: I\u2019m from Chicago, I housesit as a full time traveler. I landed in Chicago without intentions to stay with family. I had a lot of plans and goals (as usual) but every day I just had no motivation or inner willpower to do them. The dog bit me and I ended up having to go stay with family. The discomfort of the home was really affecting me mentally and physically like I thought it would. The need to get out of there made me be more proactive about tasks in a way that I always want to be. I want to feel safe and comfortable while still having the willpower and inner encouragement to do tasks. \n\nI am the QUEEN at planning and I want to become a queen at doing as well. I\u2019ve been working on my relationship with \u201cdoing\u201d in therapy but I find that I am better at changing behaviors when there is a shift in mindset, belief, or understanding attached to it. Help me understand. ",

In Polish we have a saying that roughly translates to \"it's burning around your ass\" with burning being fire, not an itch. At the same time procrastination doesn't exclude good planning - it's just a poor will of execution",
