Etc. I don\u2019t drink. Drugs on occasion and only xtc always tested and clean. I take my Adderall 30mg 2X a day. Being laid off has allowed me to start taking care of me. Mentally (trying), physically & emotionally and spiritually. So yeah. Hope I\u2019m not alone but I\u2019d hate for anyone to be in this boat with me. I\u2019m 35. ",

I don't *want* to be dead and I'm not *wishing* for death. Frankly if you're at all suicidal this is probably horrible advice. In my case, it's just a mental exercise that I find helpful.",

Or... I am *not* gone forever, in which case I will find out almost *immediately* and deal with it as I've dealt with everything else: the best way I can.\n\nBasically, if there's an answer, there's a *100%* chance I will eventually find it, so...

I deal with this even for stupid shit like what a video I've seen before is about. If someone shares something with me I watched like a week ago I'll likely know that I've seen it but won't recall anything about it really unless something in the video jogs my memory and then I'm like \"oh yeah this is the video about the a, the be and the c.\" But then other times I'll know I've seen it based on my liking it at some point but remember nothing but a vague sense that I'd seen it which might make me want to watch it less despite the fact that I don't possess any of the real knowledge or anything from the original watching.

It'll be weird watching a movie for a second time because I remember the general idea, but I can rarely remember anything specific. Then, right when the scene starts, I'll see something that triggers the memory to release, and suddenly, I remember the rest of the scene that just started when I couldn't recall anything about it before. It's so frustrating sometimes. I wish I could remember past events I've experienced without needing something to trigger that memory. I feel bad when I completely forget an encounter that for a friend would be a fond memory, but to me it looks to them like I've completely forgot about it and they only reminded me.",

I think you're better at explaining it yourself than you think. That movie example is fucking spot on too. Also a good thing to mention in general because when it comes to movies and shows, I've always felt stupid and left out growing up because everyone would watch a show or movie, say over the weekend and then maybe on Monday at school people would be making references to it left and right. I'd remember a few scenes to some degree, like the really major major stuff and maybe a line if I'm lucky, but nothing like how others seemed to be able to do it.\n\nSometimes when watching like a new episode of Family Guy or whatever I'd really try to be on the look out for something I thought would be extra funny to reference to the others and hold onto it desperately in my mind to make sure I remembered it, which would either still sometimes fail or just be to the detriment of my retention of the rest of the show or overall enjoyment. Couldn't fucking win. I generally just need to watch things at least twice to feel like I'm more on par with the average person.\n\nThe two biggest areas where my bad memory hurts me the most are:\n\n1. Remembering life events in general - I have a disproportionate number of memories between the age of like 7-15 and then it rapidly starts to deteriorate, especially when you get into my 20s. Even things like beloved concerts, of which I've only been to like 7 total - things that should really stick with me are generally just hazy things that are almost more like recalling a historical fact than a real thing that I lived through. Just \"Ah yes, in like January of...idfk, 2015 or w/e year it was, I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I had fun, allegedly.\" It can be incredibly depressing at times. Sometimes I try not to think about it, sometimes it's all I can think about.\n\nI wasn't confirmed as having ADHD until I was 26 (though I'd long suspected it) and finding out that memory issues were a thing was mindblowing, upsetting and validating all at once. The real kicker though is I've been depressed like half my life too, so I've got a double memory nerf. Big surprise that the earlier mentioned age range for peak memories ends around when I'd say the depression started to become more serious.\n\n2. Retaining knowledge about things too. I'm a fairly smart dude, especially when it comes to putting words or arguments together at times. I know a lot more words than my brain actually allows me access to, and every now and again a word I haven't thought about in ages or have hardly used will materialize from the ether right when I need it before vanishing again a short time later. It feels good to have it in the moment but sucks not being able to find it when I want to. My vocabulary is plenty functional, but it could be even richer, y'know?\n\nBut words aside, being a guy who likes to debate but also has memory issues is a huge fucking pain in the ass, and probably something I have more direct encounters with than anything else since I've done it so much over the years. I have a super strong bullshit/\"that can't be right\" detector that is probably as strong as it is because of like a partial connection to the whole \"things I know I probably know but don't know for sure that I know, but my brain knows what I know, somewhere.\" Rather than having complete facts and knowledge, I tend to remember just enough about a thing to know when something is wrong, right, or needs to be said/referenced and I can use that smidge of data to Google whatever the self-fact check/confirmation of a thing I need is. I make it work, but I'd rather have the actual memory and confidence to be able to argue in real time rather than having to always do it online where I can process and rapidly check myself and others as needed.",

I've only really had amphetamine (in the form of an oral dissolving tablet called Adzenys) and I think most of the advantage from that was just the fact that it was amphetamine lol. Had some serious downsides too like destroying my sleep and killing my appetite. It did finally get me in a healthy habit of drinking water more intentionally because I was initially on too high a dose and it would burn me up and dehydrate me. I used to be fairly unhealthy with how I rarely drank water itself unless I had a real thirst sensation, otherwise it was shit like soda or Monster. The first day I took Adzenys I drank 64oz of water in like 6 hours, it was obscene. Thankfully my body adapted somewhat and then we lowered the dosage for even more comfort and I kept the \"always have a bottle of water\" habit since. But I digress lol.\n\nAs for the memory question, yeah that's a bit tougher. Maybe if you can think back to recent weeks/months and whether you feel as though you're less forgetful or retain things better, or perhaps if you've had days where you don't take it and feel absentminded that would be telling. Outside of that, not quite sure myself. Thanks for sharing, btw.",

This all came to a head when my wife asked where something was, I remembered it being where it was supposed to be, and then we found it somewhere else. Rather than argue about it as I used to, I did what I'd learned to do since diagnosis, and accepted things as they were, reflected on it, and then had a little breakdown when I realised I couldn't actually tell the difference between imagining and remembering - not distinctly.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever I can also tell you that one time I smoked a really strong joint and suddenly remembered everything from my childhood for about an hour. I've never found anyone that can explain it or that had a similar experience but it definitely happened, and contributed to the above because for once I could tell it wasn't imagined.",

I just has money and bought a TV. I should have thought about that more.\"\n\n\nThen, weirdly, without any panic, I started to realise I had essentially _never_ made a decision in my life that wasn't an impulse. I turned and looked at my wife, and for the first time I really processed that I had chosen to be with her for the rest of my life. I was really happy I had made that decision, but I couldn't believe that that decision felt as thoughtful as my choice of what to have for dinner that night. Even if I had tried to think and reason out a decision, in the end I was just dragging the process of making a panic-driven gut choice.\n\n\nI was really lucky I ended up with a good life, and now between medication and mindfulness I can control my decison-making, but it was an eye-opening experience and it really made me see why so many people connect a lack of ADHD treatment with overloaded criminal systems, poverty, and ill-health.",

It\u2019s popped up in my head a handful of times over my life, not in any discernible pattern/with connection to the various emotional stages in my life. In this \u201crecollection,\u201d I\u2019m suddenly on a stage, in an auditorium, dressed in concert black, about to play violin for a full audience. Then the picture fades out. I don\u2019t really remember playing a full song, just maybe the first few notes of a song like, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, then nothing. I know for a fact that I took violin lessons (for an unknown period of time), sometime around 5-6 years old. I only remember ONE instance of \u201cpracticing\u201d when my parent\u2019s friends were over and I was told to \u201cgo practice (my) violin\u201d. I can kiiindaa remember getting the violin and the accessories (I always loved all the bits and bobs: the bow lacquer-block-thingy, the sheet music, the dainty, velvety-lined case!). I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s pretty scattered beyond that. It was just crazy how similar your story is and that it triggered my own memory recall!\n\nAnother commenter mentioned trigger-based memory, and that\u2019s absolutely me. The difficulty often is that I really struggle to remember most of my day-to-day life. I would be terrible if I was ever implicated for a crime because I TRULY do not remember where I was last Thursday at 1:30pm. Almost certainly not committing a crime though. I had an enlightening session with my therapist a little while ago where I talking out how my memory is cemented more and recalled easier in emotion than in detailed recollections. I can FEEL the memory that was triggered before I can recall exactly what happened. I know I had a blowout fight with my (still) best friend ~10 years ago, but for the life of me I couldn\u2019t give more than a one sentence headline and subtitle of context. What I do remember from that fight was how absolutely fucking awful I felt the entire time. I remember the waves of different emotions and impulses acted upon terrorizing me. But also, we were able to forgive and move on with space and time, so maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad and I\u2019m just incredibly emotionally sensitive (already true) and I\u2019m creating false memories and dreams are melting into reality and if i can\u2019t remember anything then does any of it matter and\u2026. yada yada. \n\nGood stuff, brain!

Even though you don\u2019t have a memory of it, there\u2019s no way something so awful didn\u2019t have a lasting effect on you. Your parents were unconscionably reckless with your emotional health in that moment (of asking you to choose) and probably countless other occasions, because a parent who could put a child in that position even one time isn\u2019t a safe person for a child to be around. \n\nIt\u2019s no wonder you have difficulty talking with people to this day about your concerns or hearing about theirs. Parents are supposed to provide a space for their child to learn that sort of sharing that\u2019s at least reasonably safe emotionally, and yours did the entire opposite. I\u2019m sure they live with regret, but their saying that they\u2019re sorry doesn\u2019t begin to repair the damage. And they won\u2019t be the ones to repair it. You\u2019re the only one who can do that for yourself. \n\nI hope you haven\u2019t entirely written off the possibility of finding a therapist to help you through this. I fully understand having no health insurance to cover the cost, and I\u2019ve been there myself. But you should know that a lot of therapists can offer low rates on a sliding, income based scale to make their services accessible to folks without a lot of money. And if the problem isn\u2019t your income but your spending \u2014 a problem that a lot of ADHDers have \u2014 I\u2019m gonna offer some unconventional advice: put your therapy bills on a credit card. If you\u2019re already loose with your spending, will it make that much difference in the long run? And to take a long view, by getting yourself healed, you might also end up being less broke too, because adhd and trauma aren\u2019t famous for enabling wise personal financial choices. \n\nI wish I had a straightforward answer for you about how to talk about things. I think it\u2019s not as easy as tips and tricks. When you\u2019ve survived the kind of emotional neglect and deprivation that it seems (based on your comments) that your parents subjected you to, healing can be a long road, and you will need much more consistent support, for a longer time, than reddit can provide. Though I share the concerns of others saying that AI shouldn\u2019t be your therapist, I get that it\u2019s something, which is more than nothing, and I understand we start with what\u2019s available where we are, because that\u2019s what there is. For me, as an uninsured young adult in the pre-AI and even pre- social media era, it was self help books and online support forums. You gotta start somewhere, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m wishing you ever increasing health and strength. I can tell you from the other side of that journey: it\u2019s worth every bit of the effort.",

I have a hard time to focus and listen and always daydreaming . But now that I\u2019m older I can\u2019t even function and work is where I am best and my happiest even though I do struggle with time management but partly that\u2019s my people pleasing part and I do unnecessary tasks to make OTHERS happy.

Inattentive type here - as a space cadet I know what it\u2019s like to struggle to remember my past.\n\nRecalling specific memories on demand isn\u2019t always possible for people like us, but you absolutely can still remember things. Don\u2019t sell yourself short or set limitations on what you can do. Remember, we\u2019re *different,* not broken. If you want to remember your past better then you need to approach things *differently,* with non-linear thinking. \n\nMy experiences with this are as follows:\n\n> Committing things to memory has had to be a conscious choice for me to make. Mindfulness really helped make me aware of that, combined with. writing technique I learned in grade school called an \u201cexpanded moment,\u201d where you choose a single lived moment / event and write about it in as much detail as you possibly can.\n\n> You recall every thought, smell, sound, feeling, the way the light plays on your surroundings, what those surroundings are, why you\u2019re responding to them like this, etc. I used to paint minis, so for me it would start by noticing things like the water stains in brickwork, or the way colors are highlighted by light, the beauty in which leaves dance in eddies of air\u2026 all the perfect imperfections of the world around me. I\u2019d commit these things to memory, take a breath, and relish in the experience of being alive. \n\n> And then I\u2019d revisit that moment, try to relive my experience, using imagination to play it back it like I\u2019m watching TV. After some time my working memory improved. I learned tricks to remember parts of my past, like sensory triggers, or putting myself back into similar situations / environments to jog my memory. Sometimes it also helps to ascribe memories to material objects, and use them to access your internal library.",
