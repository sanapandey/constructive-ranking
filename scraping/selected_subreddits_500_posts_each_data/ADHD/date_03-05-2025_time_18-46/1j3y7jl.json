    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been taking 20mgs of focalin for 8 months, and I was wondering if anyone has noticed a difference when getting different generic substitutions for their medications. I\u2019ve gotten three different generic brands of focalin and I feel like some are weaker than others. I even spoke to my friend who works for a pharmaceutical company and she said that insurance can affect the quality of medicine you receive. That meaning, you can get a common generic substitute and it work just the same or a substitute that is weaker. Obviously I don\u2019t trust it 100% but I was wondering if anyone has had a similar situation? I don\u2019t take my focalin everyday, obviously I know if I did for 8months I\u2019d have built a tolerance; sometimes I go weeks without it just because I get into a slump and forget. If anyone could leave their experiences and inputs I\u2019d greatly appreciate it :). ",
