    "selftext": "I've lived with my fiance for about 6 years now, I am a grown adult with a grown up job, pay all my bills, etc. But if he leaves and goes out of town for a day and I'm home alone, I fall deep into Gremlin mode. Cereal for lunch, PJs all day, TV and crafts all day, nothing productive. Leave out clutter piles. A couple naps, maybe. \n\nThen there's the inevitable panic clean up before he gets home because I don't want him to see how disgusting I am. \n\nIf he's gone for like a week, it gets better after a day or two and I find myself wanting to keep my living place functional again and catch up, but what the hell is this?",

I'm really trying to change this because my partner often travels for work and I spend a lot of time alone. I have definitely improved, but this is a lifetime issue for me. I have this theory that when we are young, someone else (like, parents) have the authority to structure our schedule and activities \u2013 which we do our best to rebel against, especially with adhd. As adults, we take on both roles, which is conflicting for us (with adhd). So if you don't have 'social pressure' or external structure (as in, someone else around you living a more structured life) the rebel side can just take over. Anyway, I've been telling myself that I deserve to take care of me even if I'm the only one to witness it.",

Just here to say, I have a similar experience when I\u2019m on my own. \n\nWhat has helped me is a focused, intentional approach to my alone time. Self-care becomes a bigger priority\u2014full night\u2019s sleep, good nutrition, hydration,exercise and maybe some low-anxiety social events (coffee/lunch with a friend, a hike with a buddy, etc.)\n\nThe biggest one (again for me not saying you should do this since we all experience adhd differently) is getting some simple tasks done at the very start of my day. I clean my kitchen, not a deep clean just putting dishes away, drink a grip of water, and I eat something\u2026anything. After that, I journal for a few minutes and I review my personal trello board and calendar. \n\nFrom there, it\u2019s whatever I want or need to do, but I\u2019ve found a lot of comfort in focusing on myself and basic self care right at the start of my day. It clears my head, and often will prevent my paralysis loops.\n\nLastly, i still have days where my paralysis issues get on top of me. I try to keep those days to a minimum, but when they do occur I accept that they\u2019re part of my adhd experience. I let it go, and I try again the next day. More often than not, a heavy paralysis day is a signal that I just need some rest\u2026which is perfectly normal. We\u2019re allowed to rest.",

            "body": "It\u2019s okay to just \u2018be\u2019 sometimes.  We are human **beings** after all. Whenever I have my \u2018check out from all adulting responsibilities\u2019 days and the productivity guilt starts creeping in, I think to myself, \u201cjust enjoying the being part of being human today.\u201d I don\u2019t really feel guilt about it much anymore.  I have a lot of stress in my life at the moment and it\u2019s either take time and zone out, or I\u2019ll lose my shit.  It\u2019s necessary.\n\nSociety tells us that if you aren\u2019t being productive, you\u2019re failing.  That\u2019s bullshit. There are religious roots in that way of thinking (Christianity, and being productive as a means of serving god), cultural  (kicking back for some afternoon relaxation, siesta style in the middle of the work day probably isn\u2019t going to fly in other regions, but good luck shopping mid-afternoon in a small Spanish town), and then there is good ole capitalism (gotta maximize that productivity, decrease those labour costs, and increase the profit margins; work em into the ground, just make the line go up!).  We\u2019re conditioned to use productivity as a measure of self-worth. Kids can be kids and play, that\u2019s fine.  Retirees can lounge and read the newspaper and drink tea all morning, that\u2019s great.  But if you\u2019re of working age, how dare you take pause and enjoy some peace and quiet?! We\u2019ve drawn these arbitrary age brackets that dictate at what point in our lives it\u2019s okay to just BE, but for the bulk of our years, it\u2019s not needed and it\u2019s not okay? Meh. I think that\u2019s pretty silly.\n\nIt\u2019s why I loathe the term \u201crotting\u201d when describing someone just taking a day or a weekend to just BE.  If it\u2019s helping your brain to relax a bit and leaving you feel recharged, it\u2019s not rotting.  It\u2019s resting. I had an insane year last year and I \u201crotted\u201d for the first five days of my ten day vacation.  I was completely burned out.  I wasn\u2019t rotting, I was exhausted and I needed some time to sleep, do mindless shit to try to get my brain to stop short circuiting, and sleep some more.  A family member commented that I was wasting my vacation.  I asked what I was supposed to be doing on my vacation.   Apparently I was supposed to be out having fun? Not sure who the authority is on vacation time activities but I retorted that I took time off work, and if fun felt like work then it wasn\u2019t really fun. Naps are fun, rewatching game of thrones, super fun.  Screw off with your judgement. \n\nThe demands on us never stop.  There\u2019s so much to do and never enough time to do it.  If I don\u2019t seize the needed moments to just check out from adulting, spend some time making art or journaling or hell, playing word games and binge watching some movies, I eventually burn out.  My brain gets even more chaotic.  My concentration tanks, I get more forgetful. My ability to emotionally regulate takes a nose dive.  \n\nBesides, crafting is good for the soul.  I recently started teaching myself to paint and it\u2019s basically my new mindfulness technique?  Nothing else exists when I\u2019m playing with my art supplies.  The to do lists are forgotten, the stress of what\u2019s not done just evaporates, the 18 different internal narratives get silenced.  I just\u2026.paint.  Creating things is not a waste of time, it\u2019s good for the soul. Stay calm and craft on.",

The first night or two you'll sleep for like 14 hours... But then you get to a more reasonable 9ish hours, which is just fine too!\n\nBut there's *nothing* wrong with catching up on sleep when you're at a deficit!! In fact, it's really really helpful!!
