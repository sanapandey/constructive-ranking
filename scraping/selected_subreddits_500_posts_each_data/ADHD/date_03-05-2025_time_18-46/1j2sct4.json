I have thoughts in my head all the time, either one and in a circle (rumination) or different ones, about everything.\n\nI put things off for later, or do them at the last minute. Most likely because I don't have the energy and strength to do them. Or I don't see the point of it at all.\n\nI attribute it to anxiety, but after reading other people, it sounds like there is something similar to ADHD. \n\nI was on SSRIs and my head was empty, sleep got better (rhythms), but also acquired PSSD....\n\nGoing to bed, I have tons of thoughts(questions, solutions) about life, problems, etc, but I don't even begin to address them.\n\nSo what do I have? Depression, anxiety, and consequent poor sleep.\n\nOr a norepinephrine problem?",

Important is to ask questions like whether it has happened throughout your life (ever since a young child) and if other people notice this as well, Like a teacher/boss complaining about a procrastination habit, or family/friends noticing inattentiveness. Think whether the symptoms cause problems in your daily life, and if they do, you can visit a licensed psychologist for it.",

I was almost certain and had enough to guide me, but you still need a diagnosis and professional.\n\nAs 1, it may be something else, or 2, you may just be experiencing normal problems that can occur for ADHDers but are not ADHD.\n\nIt probably is, but no one here can give you the confirmation to the level you will truly need and the threads echo that.",
