    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been aware of their disappearance for over a month now. It\u2019s annoying having to update all my payment details after getting a new card, and I don\u2019t use earphones often enough to justify buying another pair. So it\u2019s not exactly urgent. But the fact that they\u2019re missing keeps bothering me. I kept putting off looking for it, but I finally went to the last place I used it and asked, but the card wasn\u2019t there.Sometimes I listen to music while walking my dog, so maybe I dropped it then. Or it could have gotten stuck under the mattress when I moved it. I keep thinking about checking under the mattress, but I\u2019m too lazy to actually do it.\nWhenever I lose something, my mind keeps wandering, searching for it over and over again.",

I did use this as an opportunity to practice emotional deescalation. It was so strange, I had my wallet but all the cards were missing :/  ... but the big news ... i found my most favorite handmade hat later in the day. I had tucked my hat in my t-shirt drawer so as not to lose it, like two years ago!",
