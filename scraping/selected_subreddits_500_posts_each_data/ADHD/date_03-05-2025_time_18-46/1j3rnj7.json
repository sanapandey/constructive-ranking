    "selftext": "25 m. I started elvance in April 2024. In many ways, it\u2019s been amazing\u2014it\u2019s helped me get things done like nothing else ever has, and overall, I feel like a much happier and more productive person. But one issue has come up: I\u2019ve started craving alcohol during the day, which was never a problem for me before.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not on elvance, I have no real urge to drink or do anything like that. But now, on Elvanse, I find myself wanting a drink, and I can\u2019t quite figure out why. Is it because of the rush I get from being productive and getting things done? Or is it more to do with the come-down from the medication, making me subconsciously reach for alcohol to smooth it out?\nAlso I work in a high end restaurant with high quality wine available to me often, which I feel doesn\u2019t help\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",
