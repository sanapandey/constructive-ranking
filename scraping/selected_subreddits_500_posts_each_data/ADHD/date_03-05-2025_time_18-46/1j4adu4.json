    "selftext": "Hello! This is my first post and I'm hoping for some kind advice. \n\nTLDR: son won't shut up and it's driving his teacher and peers crazy. How do I help him? \n\nMy son (giving gender because I know it affects people differently) was diagnosed in kinder, as that was the absolute soonest he could. The school and teachers have been amazing. They've been on board with everything, given us accommodations without needing a 504 and all-around treat my kiddo like they're totally normal and lovable. We feel beyond lucky. \n\nHe began medication before 1st grade and it made a huge impact on his ability to focus and participate in class. \n\nNow to the present. His teacher is saying that he's struggling keeping his thoughts inside. From the second he hits the hallways he is non-stop talking, singing etc. He is blurting out in class and talking over his peers. He's got a few close friends but right now they're all getting frustrated with him. \n\nThis is not a new thing but we've managed to get it under control in the past, talking about how other people feel when we monopolize the conversation, how it's hard for teachers to teach when someone is being loud or distracting, all of it. \n\nHis pediatrician increased his XR adderall and it seemed to help but only temporarily. \n\nI'm just wondering what are some methods to help him understand that he needs to stfu? I'm obviously sensitive to RSD and I don't want to make him feel bad, but I also know that this is a real problem and we need to figure out how to help him. \n\nHow do I get him to keep quiet without thinking there is something wrong with him or that he is in trouble? How can I support his amazing teacher while she tries to educate around him? \n\nThanks for reading, and I appreciate any advice I can get! \n\n(Edit: for our AuDHD friends, does this sound like any of you? I am open to the idea he might be dual diagnosis) ",

Another kid in our school was given a toy to play with at his desk so as to aid with stimulation and make him less inclined to disrupt the class for others. But I find if a teacher is teaching in an engaging way then it helped me focus and chat a lot less. Maybe as your son's teachers if they can create a more interactive learning experience giving your kid the opportunity to take part and actually talk and give input in the lessons themselves.",

            "body": "Hi! Just to say I don\u2019t really have many tips \ud83d\ude02 I struggled with this myself (both me and my oldest daughter have ADHD although it manifests very differently). As a kid myself I did learn through \u201cpunitive\u201d actions that it wasn\u2019t ok - my primary school teacher would ask me to go outside for like 5 minutes if I was talking too much and continued after warnings. It did help me understand this was not an acceptable behaviour. I don\u2019t remember feeling that bad about it to be fair. In my daughter\u2019s school I know they sometimes use the technique of going outside as a movement break if the kids are getting more agitated - so maybe this is a better version of a 5 minute non punitive break. Sometimes they just need to release their energy. I know if I want to talk and I can\u2019t I won\u2019t be paying attention because I will be thinking about all these things I want to say - so even if he learns to shut up doesn\u2019t mean he is focused (just a warning \ud83d\ude02). But it does feel like maybe the meds aren\u2019t adjusted? But obviously that would be something to discuss with the psychiatrist. At the end of the day I do think he will learn over time and by seeing his peers. Best of luck!",

I know this was part of the diagnostic questions at least. It\u2019s our impulsiveness and overthinking (in the sense of 100 thoughts at once) at work. So I think we all suffer from it and we all adapt through life. Most teachers feel it\u2019s slightly endearing to have a chatterbox kid - it\u2019s also good for class engagement because you know you always have one that will talk to you \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m a lecturer now so still enjoy talking a lot with my students (and really enjoy my ADHD/other thinking students )",

            "body": "Oof. This was a battle of my mind. Lol.\n\nI was this child. No one was particularly punitive but every single parent/teacher conversation centered around \u201cshe talks a lot and can\u2019t stop\u201d. Granted, I wasn\u2019t diagnosed until my late 20s so no one suspected ADHD.\n\nI\u2019m very perceptive so that confident, chatterbox little girl turned into a woman who is introverted and doesn\u2019t talk much. I\u2019m absolutely able to open up with friends and family, but I\u2019m more of an observer now than I am a talker.\n\nIt took me years from childhood to young adulthood but I seriously internalized the \u201cstfu\u201d message even though it was indirect, I think I probably over corrected though\ud83d\ude15\n\nMy first thought reading this was \u201cis talking a lot really that bad?\u2026\u201d and yes, with nuance I can see that even adults need to know when to shut it. Especially for boys/men who are socialized more so to be \u201cvocal and confident\u201d and in today\u2019s world a lot of women wish they would shut it. Lol.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I have suggestions but I just wanted to offer a perspective of having the confident talker persona completely knocked out of me. One thing that came to mind is, do you have to be the one to deliver this message? It sucked the most that my mother, who is supposed to love and support me and think I\u2019m awesome (this was my simplified view as a kid) had to be the one to tell me to zip it constantly. I feel like my peers might have been better messengers for that message. Then it\u2019s more of a social lesson than a judgement on his personality.\n\nIdk. I\u2019m thinking out loud now but I just hate how much my \u201ctrue\u201d personality was crushed as I grew up.",

I ended up a super anxious woman who always worries whether or not people are actually Enjoying their conversation with me, worrying about talking too much, and basically masking all of my inner talkative urges until I know that the person really likes me or not. \n\nThe absolute last thing that I want to do is impart that anxiety onto my child, but I also am not sure how to get him to understand at the age of seven that not everybody in the universe wants to hear about steam engines 24 seven, and that while he is at school he needs to be respectful of the teacher trying to teach",

In my case, my mom would be the one to communicate what my teacher had said. Because I know she likes me A LOT, it was almost worse from her because it was a judgement from someone who knows me very well.\n\nIf my teacher would have been the one to talk to me, I probably would have been embarrassed because I truly could not help it, but at least it\u2019s coming from someone who doesn\u2019t inherently know me deeply. I wonder if my Mom had kinda stayed out of that feedback if I would have internalized it differently? It sounds like you\u2019re working with great teachers so maybe asking them to have that conversation and set expectations would be a thing to try?",

            "body": "Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. \n\nRejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.\n\nHere are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:\n\n* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)\n* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)\n* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)\n\nAlthough r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. \n\nHowever, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action.

            "body": "I feel this so much. I was that talker as a kid. \n\nIn first grade I was sent to sit in the hallway a lot but the teacher never took time to separately sit down with me and explain exactly what about my behavior was wrong, just that I was \u201cbad/too much\u201d. I never told my mom I was sent to the hallway weekly if not almost daily and sometimes forgotten out there (it was cold some days!) because I didn\u2019t want my parents to know I was \u201cbad\u201d and I didn\u2019t want them disappointed in me and I didn\u2019t want to get into even more trouble at home. \n\nThen in second grade my teacher was mean with how she addressed my excess talking in front of the whole class every time and she would embarrass me. In the middle of a lesson one day she stopped class, made me get up, and then physically dragged my desk so it was directly against her teachers desk away from the rest of my classmates. I sat like this for the rest of the year. The kids started treating me different or wouldn\u2019t talk to me because they didn\u2019t want to get in trouble like me. They associated me with trouble because that\u2019s how the teacher treated me. This same teacher would take away recess from me as punishment if I was talking too much and too hyper. She recommended holding me back a grade because she thought I was immature but my mom said no, I\u2019m just a kid and kids talk and I didn\u2019t have any issues with the learning my materials. \n\nI struggled the rest of my time in school. Always getting in trouble for talking too much, having too much energy, interrupting, forgetting homework etc. i was called lazy by teachers, shamed for messy and late or missed assignments, accused of not caring and not paying attention. I somehow graduated high school and even got into college, but I ultimately dropped out because I didn\u2019t have the tools I now know I needed to help me be successful.\n\n\nAs another commenter said, these experiences dulled my extroverted personality and I became much more introverted and self conscious and unsure of myself. I felt like being me was bad, I felt like I was too much. I was not diagnosed with ADHD until an adult and now so many things make sense. My heart hurts for childhood me. All of my adults failed me as a kid in not recognizing that I should have been tested. I could have been SO successful and so much more confident had I had the right tools provided for me. As an adult I\u2019m honestly still working on some of these feelings of being too much or too weird at time although I\u2019m much better than I was. \n\nAll of that to say, when It comes to your son, I know the school and teacher have been wonderful so far but maybe getting a 504 plan in place for some more accommodations for your son could be just that bit extra help needed to help him succeed. Maybe some fidget toys or a journal for all of his thoughts that he needs to get out could help, maybe every 20-30 minutes he steps into the hallway to do some jumping jacks and get all the wiggles out and then comes back In to calmly sit down and reengage. There is a way for him to be successful and not feel like he is \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d you just have to find what works best. \n\nGood luck mama, you\u2019ve got this!",
