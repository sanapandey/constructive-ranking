    "selftext": "Hi, I just wanted to vent about how much I hate grocery shopping with ADHD, as I have spent almost an hour trying to write a fucking grocery list and I barely made a dent! \n\nEvery week it\u2019s the same struggle of trying to make a grocery list and immediately getting overwhelmed by it. My fianc\u00e9 usually does the shopping, but I\u2019m in charge of the list because I have dietary restrictions. I try to make my lists/meals simple, but I still drag my feet every time. \n\nPlanning and executive dysfunction DO NOT go together! That is all. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk \ud83e\udee0\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the suggestions and shared experiences! I\u2019m so glad this subreddit exists and that we\u2019re all here to help each other! ",

Now I do more frequent but shorter small shops. 10-15 minutes in and out (if I don't get distracted browsing lol).\u00a0\n\n\nMy method: I keep basic pantry items stocked. E.g. pasta, rice, beans, potatoes, bread, tortillas, sauce, salsa, crackers, cheese, olives, yogurt, dried/frozen fruits, frozen veg, bananas/apples/oranges, canned fish, nuts, oatmeal, peanutbutter, etc. Basic items serve as the basis for more complex meals. They can also be used for a basic meal in a pinch. (E.g. Crackers and cheese, yogurt and fruit, peanut butter toast)\n\n\nI buy based on items i already have in stock. Open the cabinet. What do you have? What can you make with what you already have? What ingredients would you need for a meal?\u00a0\n\n\nE.g. I have tortillas, potatoes, beans, and salsa at home. After work i stop at market for 10 minutes to grab mex cheese, tomato, avocado, cilantro. Then I have a meal (cheesy bean burrito) after a short shop. If i get tortilla chips, i also buy hummus, and make bean salsa. Then you have different meals/snacks for a few days from one shop of ingredients.\u00a0\n\n\nPair purchases together so if you get one, you get the other(s). E.g. chips/hummus, sourdough/cheese/soup, steak/potato/salad, pasta/sauce/vegetable. Whatever combos work for you. Then you have a complete meal(s). Figure out what meals are quick, easy, cheap - put them on rotation. Try to pair ingredients so one thing can be used for multiple meals. E.g. get a ton of broccoli, make pasta one day, make meat/potatoes the next. Or get pesto, make pasta, make pizza, make caprese. This takes some culinary creativity!\n\n\nA short stop after work is nice because I'm already out and about, but I want to get home, so I move fast and get 5-10 items in 10-20 minutes. A small shop is soooo much easier and less overwhelming than a Big Shop.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, don't sleep on frozen foods and prepared food. Sometimes just grabbing a rotisserie chicken and salad stuff will tide me over a few days. I have been known to live on snacks and sandwiches for extended periods.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm procrastinating that's why this is so long. Hope this helps!",

Grocery shopping sucks a**. \n\nI make it bearable by going during a quiet time and making a list that is in the order of the store layout so that I don't have to backtrack. Earbuds. Headphones. Still sucks tho.",

Whereas if I\u2019m just adding items to my Walmart shopping cart as I notice things that we need, I spend less on unnecessary things. For the most part. Not always though lol.

Just tell it your budget, the grocery stores, what kind of meals you make, anything and everything. You can even just type away what\u2019s stressful about it like word vomit on your mind and it makes a list. I highly recommend it.\nEdit: it\u2019s especially good if you have dietary restrictions!! Mention that too. I really urge you to try this because it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve done in terms of food. I ended up saving so much money because I\u2019m not eating out or anything.",
