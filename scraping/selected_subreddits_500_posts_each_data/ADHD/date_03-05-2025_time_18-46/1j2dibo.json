    "selftext": "I was put on Wellbutrin recently as a way to treat my ADHD. After 200 mg had no effect, it was increased to 300. After that still had no effect, we decided to try Adderall. I was given 10 mg tablets of Adderall and told to take it on weekdays to see how it affects me. I was also told to decrease to 200 mg of Wellbutrin so I can come off of it. To do this, I\u2019m gonna have to take both. Will that do anything to me",
