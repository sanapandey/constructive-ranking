    "selftext": "I'm struggling right now with adjusting to the \"missed lifetime\" of things and becoming more aware of the mechanics of ADHD and its comorbidities. My marriage was already in a downward spiral, I was hugely addicted to gaming, a stress eater, and generally directionless and frustrated. I was diagnosed about 6 months ago and started on 10mg of Adderall. That got bumped up a few weeks ago to 20's and the change is insane. I rolled over a 401k that was sitting for a decade that I couldn't bring myself to do, or remember to do, anything about. Found another one from my 20's, (I'm 40 in June), and got that process started. I've started dieting, recording food, reorganizing at work, flipped my sleep schedule, workout routine is next and it's been a few weeks. I feel like, I think, human beings feel. And with that is also coming a huge wave of crazy backlogged emotions. I thought that I had given up on life. I don't keep in touch with my family. My marriage is crumbling (even as I work to make myself and the things around me better). In addition to ADHD I have PTSD and PDD/Dysthymia diagnoses. And despite all of that I still don't feel as hopeless as I did walking into work, or getting out of bed, prior to medicating and therapy. I'm profoundly saddened by all of it, and I definitely get depression spikes. I know I have a long way to go, I just hope the important relationships I have survive the changes that I'm making I guess.",
