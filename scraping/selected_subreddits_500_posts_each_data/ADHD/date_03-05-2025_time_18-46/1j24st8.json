    "selftext": "I'm on Elvanse and have been for about a month now. Prior to that I was unmedicated and undiagnosed. Well it's gardening season and I'm prepping the garden for the new growing season. One of the things I needed to get done is installing a pond which I've had in storage for a year. Well, Saturday comes around and I head out to the garden and start digging up and prepping the area the pond is going in. I did not stop for 8 hours. Digging, heavy lifting, squatting. When I finished the pond was 3/4 of the way finished. I walked into the house and suddenly I could feel my arms and they were in agony. I was almost crying from the pain. I took painkillers and went to bed. The next day I felt fine..... So I worked on the pond for another 8 hours straight -_-\nFinished up, walked inside and my hips, back and legs felt like they were trying to kill me. \nI focused so hard on my task for two days solid and didn't feel any pain whilst carrying out the task. But the moment I finish, I'm instantly aware of how I've punished my body. Is this normal?.",
