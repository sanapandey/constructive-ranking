    "selftext": "Hey guys! \n\nI\u2019ve always been a bit of gambler, playing slots/pokies in local clubs for the past 10 years or so. Nothing major, few decent losses but acceptable at the time. \n\nI was diagnosed and medicated in September 2023. Since then I have lost over $200K and I\u2019m currently in knee-deep debt. \n\nI started with Dex and I\u2019m currently on Vyvanse. I can sit for hours on the machine, no water, no food, just nicotine and adrenaline. \n\nHas anyone had this issue where their gambling became worse after starting medication? \n\nI told my psych about it but he doesn\u2019t think that there is a correlation. \n\nCheers!
