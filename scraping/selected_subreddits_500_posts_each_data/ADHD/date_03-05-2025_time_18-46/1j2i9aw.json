The problem is there is no why, I'm just an anxious person. Exercise, prayer, and anchoring myself in reality are super helpful for me. You are not alone!",

            "body": "Getting in anxiety medicine helped me with this a lot.  \n\nI have had a few serious medical issues happen to my family members, and I would characterize what I experienced as health, anxiety or even PTSD from some of those issues.  A major health scare happened to my child and caused me to reach out to my primary care about it, because the anxiety was causing so much difficulty during that time.\n\nThey put me on buspar.  It wasn't until about 2 weeks later when I had a bruise that would have sent me into a major \" research/ monitor/ worry\" cycle that I realized how much of an impact it had made.  I was able to look at it and say \" nah, that's probably not anything I need to worry about right now\" even after seeing something and having the thought \" This bruise could indicate something really bad\". \n\nMy therapist told me that anxiety medicine should basically give you a choice about what you want to do with your anxiety, rather than completely remove it.   As strange as it sounds, It wasn't until the moment I saw that bruise that I realized... I have never had the ability to turn away from an anxiety spiral like that.  I could always make the same conscious assessment, But it would not necessarily allow me to turn off the worry about it.  But now I can.\n\nThe most interesting thing for me is that I never thought I had anxiety, because there was always a source for the concern and I really didn't know that other people could just literally not think about it if they didn't want to.  I think this is partly where the ADHD comes in for me, because There are a lot of things that have to be kind of intense from a sensory perspective for me to notice them... So I think I was only consciously aware of these health anxieties when they got really out of proportion or sent me to the doctor.  But they were kind of existing at a low level all the time. \n\nI share all this so that hopefully you know you aren't alone, and maybe my story will encourage you to reach out and see if there are things that could be better for you as well.",

I made the doctors run every test you can think of and, while I was told every time that I was fine, I never believed them. I wasted entire year of my life going through testing and fell into a pit of depression and nonstop Googling for answers. The more I researched online, the worse I felt, and the more the symptoms got worse.  I literally started preparing a will because I thought that was it for me. It\u2019s crazy how much power the mind has on our body. It was terrible. I was finally put on Prozac and within a month or so the fear and anxiety started going away. The \u201csymptoms\u201d that I thought I had started to disappear. All the worry I had went away. It\u2019s been life saving for me. I tried tapering off the medication one year but noticed the anxiety started to creep back up, so I\u2019ll likely be on the medication for the rest of my life. I\u2019m okay with that though. Being on anxiety medication has made me realize that I\u2019ve had anxiety all my life, i just never realized it.",

However, I went through the CBT course unmedicated, and I feel like that was a mistake because I got SO depressed while I was going through it. The exercises ruined every single day for me for months (I think my undiagnosed ADHD made this even worse) to the point where I would sit on my bed and cry right after waking up. It was terrible and everything in my life suffered. But, it worked, and I would say my health anxiety decreased by close to 100%.\n\nHoooooowever, Vyvanse has helped me SO much with my anxiety in general, and it makes me able to control my thoughts.. which is sortof a prerequisite or nice to have skill for even doing CBT (I realise now\u2026).\n\nMy advice would honestly be to get medicated for your ADHD first, since that might fix the issue. If the health anxiety still remains after a few months of being properly medicated, I would ask for an antidepressant and look into CBT.",

I am very medication sensitive, I have been on lyrica for anxiety for 2 years but it only worked for 3/4 months. I want to stop it. I cannot tolerate side effects of any adhd meds so far. I think untreated adhd makes health anxiety worse because I cannot manage what I focus on.",

Or rabies when you\u2019ve never been bitten. That sort of thing. My fears are more things like breast cancer which in a middle aged woman is a reasonable thing to fear.)",
