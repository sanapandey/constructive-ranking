    "selftext": "My mum has shown symptoms of ADHD my whole life. I rarely speak to my dad and my mum and me live together like awkward roommates. \n\nSince I was about 11, am 15 now, I just noticed I was different. Even different to people in similar situations to me. \n\nI\u2019ve done my research, I know I have it. The form I have to give to my GP, my mum has to fill it out. Every time I\u2019d answer she\u2019d sigh and just say, \u201cI don\u2019t think you doooo\u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so pissed. I just want someone to believe me. My therapist first pointed it out and my friends have always joked about it. People who TRUELY know me. Why does it have to be someone who\u2019s like a stranger who fills out this stupid form. \n\nSorry i\u2019m just so fed up with not being listened to, kind of need help and tips on how getting diagnosed at this age in England works. Pls lmk!",
