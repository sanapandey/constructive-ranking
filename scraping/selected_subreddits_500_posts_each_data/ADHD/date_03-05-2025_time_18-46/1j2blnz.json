    "selftext": "Hello, please don't judge me - I made some mistakes on Saturday night while out at a festival and did 25mg of dexies while drinking. I have ADHD but am not prescribed dexies but rather and SNRI so I was handed them by a friend.  \n\nI felt fine on the night and very buzzed, but two days later I feel terrible and have some very worrying tightness around my heart on the left side of my chest. It feels kind of heavy and I'm incredibly nauseous and tired.\n\nIs this a relatively normal thing to experience after doing so much while drinking? Will it subside over the next few days or should I be booking in to see a GP? Realistically I won't be able to get an appointment for at least 2-3 days and imagine it's possible the symptoms will fade by then...\n\nSafe to say, I won't be abusing the drug in that way again...

Stimulants lessen the effects of alcohol in the moment especially if you\u2019re not used to it so if you were \u201cvery buzzed\u201d you prob were drank a decent amount. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so dangerous, you can be nearing alcohol poisoning and feel alright",
