    "selftext": "So I have to see my psychiatrist later this Month. And my 20mg adderall XR isnt working for me anymore. I have to drink 2 cups of coffee plus an energy drink in order to get my homework done on top of struggling to keep my eyes open. Last time i brought up adderall not working she suggested to put me on a different adhd medication. And i know Ritalin gives me a terrible headache. I would like to try 30mg adderall XR. But knowing how she is she will try a new medication instead. So any tips on how to advocate for myself and what to avoid? I am a little nervous even trying to tell her the medication is making me struggle.",

            "body": "This might not actually be a medication issue, but a brain management one.\n\nAdderall (or other stimulant medication for that matter) doesn't just stop working if it worked fine before; tolerance buildup like with caffeine, where you need increasingly large dosages to sustain the effect, is rare at therapeutic dosages. More often, when medication \"stops working\", what's really going on is that you are increasing the demands on your brain, until it feels \"normal\" again - except that what feels \"normal\" to you is what your brain felt like before meds, when you were constantly overworking it. And meds can only do so much, and that \"normal\" feeling is actually the point where your brain is so overworked that the meds can't keep up anymore. No wonder you're tired.\n\nSo what I would suggest is to ditch the caffeine (it won't do you any good in the long run - it doesn't work against ADHD symptoms anyway, all it does is trick your brain into not feeling tired; I know what I'm talking about, I went from 12-16 cups per day to zero when I got my diagnosis, and it was one of the best things I've ever done), \"unload your brain\", get the sleep you need, make time for self-care, reduce the demands you put on your brain to sustainable levels; eat some good food, get some fresh air, do some exercise, and if this is what's really going on, chances are your meds will \"start working again\".",

Obviously I can\u2019t say for sure since I\u2019m not a psych but I know the feeling since I\u2019ve had to up meds in the past as well. Sometimes you just need to find the right dosage that is the best for you. Definitely advocate for yourself. What I\u2019ve done is write down everything I\u2019ve experienced (how I felt from time to time, when I noticed it was no longer working, what I\u2019ve been noticing since, etc.) and presented it to my psych. I\u2019ve dealt with psychs that have treated me like a pill mule which is not fun at all but definitely advocate for yourself in the way that works most for you.",

I\u2019ve been in a similar situation, and what helped me was being really clear about what isn\u2019t working and why I think a dose increase makes sense.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how you can approach it:\n\n\n1. Be specific about what\u2019s wrong. Instead of just saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d try:\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly tired, struggling to keep my eyes open, and relying on caffeine just to get through my work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Make your case for increasing the dose.\n\n\n\u201cI know Adderall works for me to some degree, but 20mg isn\u2019t cutting it anymore. Ritalin gave me bad headaches, so I\u2019d really prefer to try 30mg before switching to something else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Acknowledge her expertise but push for a conversation.\n\n\n\u201cI trust your judgment, but I\u2019d really like to understand why switching would be better than just increasing the dose. Can we talk through the options?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf she pushes for a new med, ask:\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason for switching instead of adjusting?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are the pros and cons of trying a higher dose first?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s your treatment, so don\u2019t be afraid to advocate for yourself. This video really nails what it\u2019s like figuring out ADHD meds and adjusting doses: https://youtu.be/bQ_wDpISzGY.\n\n\nHope your appointment goes well!",
