Take this time to eat as much healthy food as you can so your body can fight off the sickness.\n\nAlthough stimulants help up adhders function better, they unfortunately are known to lower the immune system.\n\nFeel better..",

Yes all of that makes sense so I\u2019ll lay off them.\n\nI did take a little Adderall yesterday (7.5 mg) after a 3 week break because I was on vacation overseas & couldn\u2019t get my medication permit approved in time & I feel like it gave me a false sense of feeling better.\n\nToday I woke up feeling just as fatigued as the day before. It\u2019s just so hard not being able to get back into my routine and actually get work done but that\u2019s life I guess.",
