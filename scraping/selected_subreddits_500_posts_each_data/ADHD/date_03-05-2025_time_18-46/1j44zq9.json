    "selftext": "I am at the end of my tether trying to get into a decent sleep pattern. It's not insomnia because I can sleep during the day. It's been like this for pretty much my entire life (except when I was on antipsychotics that just made me sleep 16 hours a day) but particularly the last couple of years.\n\nMy partner blames it exclusively on meds but I was only diagnosed 6 years ago (35) and I was still on the antipsychotics when we met. Meds weren't a factor when I was at school, but sleep problems contributed to me having to more or less homeschool myself from 14 on. It's been a major factor in preventing me from holding down a job for long and it's now getting to the point where I barely see my family. Winter days are very short where I live so it would also be good to you know, see the sun.\n\nI'm aware of the concept of revenge bedtime, and I guess I can focus better at night with no distractions, but I also can't DO anything because I don't want to wake anyone up. It doesn't seem to matter if I force myself to push through and stay awake in the morning, I've been up for three days in a row trying to do that. And I am a literal monster when I'm sleep deprived, much worse the last two weeks of my cycle.\n\nI've tried eliminating caffeine, I take my meds early, even before I get to sleep sometimes and it doesn't seem to matter, just feels like a waste. Sleeping tablets lead to long miserable nights of being drowsy but not being able to fall asleep until dawn. Lately I've been trying to just not worry about it, taking the pressure off in the hope it will result in a healthier pattern but to no avail. I'm just so depressed and I feel like I'm missing out on my entire life.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this?",

I feel like I\u2019m just constantly forced to operate outside of my optimization hours\u2026 it\u2019s v frustrating. Have you considered seeking out night shift jobs?",

I imagine working late at night would work really well for me but super early in the morning would be a nightmare, sorry you're having to deal with this! \n\nI actually told my partner earlier that I might give up and pick up a night shift somewhere, he joked that having to be up at night might shift my pattern due to pure demand avoidance lol. It's definitely worth a try either way!",
