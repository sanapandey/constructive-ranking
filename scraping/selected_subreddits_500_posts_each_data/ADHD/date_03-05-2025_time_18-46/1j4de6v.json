    "selftext": "I have been taking Focalin for the past 3 years but I have to get a 10 panel urine drug test for a job and I am worried that it is going to show up on there. I read that it can stay in your system 2-3 days after you take it and I am going to be taking it two days before because I have a final that day. Has anyone had to take a drug test on their meds and has it shown up? ",

I really don\u2019t think they won\u2019t hire you because you have ADHD. But if they do like one of the people said here if they don\u2019t hire you because of that medicine then you dodged a bullet. Because I wouldn\u2019t want to work for a company that won\u2019t let me take the medicine I need.",
