But it makes me feel so normal and I get so much stuff done. I actually feel like I\u2019m help for once. \n\nI am chronically ill at ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, and depression, so it makes it so hard to feel like that I belong on the world. With the medication I feel like that I do and that I actually am a member of society end of my household. I don\u2019t feel disconnected. ",

Each of us is different and needs different doses/types of meds.  Don't be afraid to ask for an adjustment from your prescriber.",

            "body": "Yes, I do double up on my ADHD medication sometimes. However, I have been prescribed it for three years now. I\u2019ve built up a tolerance in my system, so even the highest dose that can be prescribed wouldn\u2019t do much for me. So, I double up. But, I\u2019ve limited myself to doubling up 3x a month (with three days off) to avoid running out of meds. \n\nYou\u2019re probably noticing an issue here though: you\u2019re dependent on a medication that\u2019s bound to run out at some point; and it\u2019ll run out faster if you\u2019re taking extras. What you\u2019re describing here is medication misuse, which isn\u2019t something I\u2019m going to condone for anyone but myself. However, if you\u2019re going to continue doing this, set limits for yourself on how many times a month you plan on taking extras. Space it out so you don\u2019t run out or become tolerant to the higher dose that you\u2019re taking.\n\nFinally, another thing to keep in mind is that oftentimes prescribers drug test to ensure that you\u2019re taking your medication as prescribed. You don\u2019t wanna get caught misusing your medication, because there will be no medication to take if that happens.\n\nYour best course of action here is to chat with your prescriber about raising your dose imo.",

I\u2019d like it to be higher to be honest, but my psychiatrist is an ass. I was at a pretty low dose for a while in between, and it SUCKED. It did not work at all for me.",

I went to therapy, I did all the assessments and ADHD was the obvious conclusion. And going off meds that at least help with anxiety and brain fog if nothing else isn\u2019t a solution.",
