    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been diagnosed twice, first in the third grade and the second when I was 17 and no one would believe me or help me manage it. In fact the first time they just put me on a massive Ritalin dosage and I\u2019m pretty sure that plus my un managed symptoms are what contributed to my excessive drug use and frequent experimentation with different substances and routes of ingestion(fine now ya\u2019ll.) also both times and not once in my adolescence or young adulthood did anyone think to take me to a therapist or psychiatrist again or encourage me after I was out of high school and struggling greatly. Holding a job was hard growing up but over the years as I aged I did mellow out and learn somewhat how to manage my symptoms. However I didn\u2019t know a lot of my \u201cquirks\u201d and spastic behavior even was ADHD. Ironically I often fixate on learning about various conditions and maladies especially when a friend has one, but I never looked into adhd for myself since I never met anyone else with adhd, or made any sort of friends with one at least. \n\nAnyways I finally got a job I was able to hold down, working for the state as a welfare agent, eligibility specialist. Largely because after 6 months I was able to work from home which allowed me to isolate from distractions and also keep myself properly stimulated with music in the background or videos on my phone that I couldn\u2019t do in the work space. \n\n\nBut over the past couple years since I found what I believe to be my calling which is mixing music I have stopped being able to compartmentalize and stave off boredom and disinterest with my desk job. I genuinely love working on and helping others with their music and am enamored with even the most mundane aspects of it. I\u2019m also open to to other  careers in music I just don\u2019t want to be a professional musician myself. Does anyone have advice for someone with bad adhd regarding finding work in the music industry that may differ from advice you\u2019d give someone that isn\u2019t high on that spectrum? ",
