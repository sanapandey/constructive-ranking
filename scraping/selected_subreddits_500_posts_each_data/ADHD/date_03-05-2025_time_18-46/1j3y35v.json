    "selftext": "I have no one to tell this so I will post here: I just finished reading philosophy at uni, and will be graduating. It has been about 2.5 year since my diagnosis and about 1.5 years since I started medication. \n\nThe effect (among others things) of medication and psychotherapy: I will be graduating with the highest honour. There still are things I am bad at: I still miss deadlines (graciously, my professors are understanding), I still underestimate my abilities, doubt myself all the time,, and if I can, I will always chose to stay home over attending any gathering (which also means I will not attend the graduation ceremony).\n\nJust for those who doubted that there are better times to come. Please keep trying. Do not give up. It gets better.",
