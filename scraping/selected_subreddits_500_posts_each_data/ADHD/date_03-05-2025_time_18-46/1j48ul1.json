    "selftext": "     I forgot to take my medication (Vyvanse) yesterday and it just felt like I was a different person. It always does when I'm not on my medication which is so frustrating and difficult to deal with, like, one day, I'm rearranging my kitchen and removing problems I've been procrastinating taking care of for ages, and the next I'm sitting on my phone the entire day having eaten nothing but crackers and ice cream.\n\n    I really wanted to finish what I needed to, but it feels nigh physically impossible to escape the couch, the floor, or wherever I decide to passively lay down and scroll on my phone. The cognitive dissonance between feeling competent and empowered versus feeling like a South Park parody of a lazy slobby person is really getting to me, especially since I'm transitioning into adulthood and responsibilities are getting very serious very quickly. Yarg I say, yarg. ",

The difference between being medicated and unmedicated is like night and day\u2014one moment, I can function like a \"normal\" person, and the next, it\u2019s like my brain is working against me. Tasks that felt easy yesterday suddenly feel impossible. The motivation, the focus, the ability to just start things\u2014it all disappears, and I\u2019m left wondering how I ever managed without meds in the first place.\n\n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating knowing what I could be capable of, but only if my brain cooperates. If you relate to this struggle, this video really captures what it\u2019s like: youtube[dot]com/watch?v=bQ_wDpISzGY. Just needed to vent\u2014anyone else feel this way?",
