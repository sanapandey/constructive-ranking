    "selftext": "I (27M) have been pretty sure for a few years now that I have struggled with ADHD symptoms all my life, and recently, I've begun the journey of seeing a psychiatrist and starting the evaluation process for a diagnosis and medication. As part of the evaluation, they ask a lot of family medical and personal history questions, and while going through it, I have needed to reach out to my mom to answer questions about family members, get old report cards, etc. \n\nWhen I told her the reason for these questions was because I was getting evaluated for ADHD, she got pretty angry with me and made a lot of denials and stopped responding to my questions. I was told by the psychiatrist that ADHD can be up to 80% hereditary, and I think my mom has very strong ADHD symptoms undiagnosed, possibly even worse than myself, though she doesn't really believe in mental health. This has created a struggle for me, beyond the screener itself, I have an otherwise good relationship with my mom but she seems extremely sensitive to this issue and has a lot of shame, denial, projection, or something else about herself or possibly her children having \"something wrong with them\" as she puts it. \n\nHas anyone had any experiences on here with possibly undiagnosed ADHD parents or family members and trying to engage positively in conversation with them about this stuff? Any advice or practical wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",

A parents priority in life to is give their children the best life possible and this diagnosis may make her feel like she has failed at the job that means more to her than anything else in the world.\n\nOr she may somehow feel that ADHD is caused by something she did as a parent or didn\u2019t do.  It\u2019s not easy for a parent to cope with these feelings",
