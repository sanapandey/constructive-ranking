    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been working with my psychiatrist for a few months and was diagnosed with ADHD two months ago. Last month, I started taking Vyvanse. My psychiatrist told me that since it\u2019s a controlled substance, I need to have a Telehealth appointment every month to get a refill, as it can only be prescribed for 30 days at a time.\n\nThe issue is that these Telehealth appointments cost $250 each. They\u2019re in-network, so I get a small discount, but I still end up paying $250 for a 10-minute call. My previous in-person appointments were around the same price. Between this and the cost of the prescription, I\u2019m not sure I can afford to keep up with it.\n\nI\u2019m in Illinois, it\u2019s a schedule II but I found that it\u2019s based off your insurance. And I found out that my insurance does allow 90-day prescriptions. I\u2019m considering asking my psychiatrist if he can write a 90-day script but dispense it in 30-day intervals so I can still pick it up monthly. Is that something he might agree to?\n\nAlso, is it standard to require a monthly appointment just for a refill? If he refuses the 90-day option, what alternatives do I have? Would my PCP be able to prescribe it instead?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Once that was done I didn\u2019t have to go in every month, but I did have to go in every 3 months for a drug test. \n\nHonestly, it just seemed like a cash grab to me, and so does your situation. Either that or, the doc doesn\u2019t want to prescribe it, so they\u2019re hoping you leave as a patient \n\nIt seems messed up to take someone with ADHD and then load them down with appointments they have to keep up with.",
