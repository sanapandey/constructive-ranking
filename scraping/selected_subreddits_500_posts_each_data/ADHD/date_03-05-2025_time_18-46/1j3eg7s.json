I am driving crazy waiting for a video phone call from my family (I have a toxic relationship because my mother and aunt have mental health problems and are abusive to me when they don't take their meds) The call is for my grandfather birthday, and I love him, and I know everyone is gonna act chill but I am not chill at all. What should I do to kill time? Does this happens to you aswell? I have this issue with every phone call, even if I know the person and I know is not gonna be serious or bad. But I am full of anxiety and can\u00b4t do nothing! I have 2 hours left , omg.",

Around the house, e.g.\n\n- do dishes\n- depending on laundry status: pick up laundry from floor or put in washing machine or put clean laundry in closet\n- pick up stuff or trash that's laying around at random places  \n- vacuuming\n- dusting \n- change bedsheets\n\nOr self care like:\n\n- clip nails or mani/pedicure\n- floss/brush teeth extra thoroughly \n- shave (if there's anything you shave) \n- hair care (if you have complicated hair) \n- shower (/scrub)\n\nEtc. I'm not saying I'm not regularly doing those things anyway, but you know how it goes, there's always at least some aspect of your house or yourself that could use some care and attention",
