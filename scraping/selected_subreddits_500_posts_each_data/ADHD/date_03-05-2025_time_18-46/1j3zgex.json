    "selftext": "I went in last week for a hearing test due to some new, weird tinnitus, fully expecting to walk out with hearing aids. I\u2019ve had difficulty hearing all my life, and I chalked it up to chronic ear infections as a child (to the point I can\u2019t watch That Scene in Wrath of Khan, but I LOVE the taste of pink amoxicillin) and listening to my Walkman too loud. Fully expecting to go in and pay the piper for a lifetime of bad noise hygiene. Not to mention I\u2019m fifty now, and my hearing is not likely to get better with age. Thousands of dollars I don\u2019t have, or twenty to forty more years of being a parody. \u201cEH? WHAT\u2019S THAT, SONNY? SPEAK INTO MY CARTOON EAR HORN!\u201d\n\nFolks. My ears are in perfect working order. I scored almost perfectly by every metric tested. I\u2019d presumed APD was a factor in my inability to understand people, but learning that it\u2019s the whole thing was interesting. \n\nMy questions are: what is the assessment like? And what strategies or treatments have you found useful? The person administering the test said there\u2019s a kind of noise canceling earbuds that bring down ambient sound to bring conversation to the fore, which I\u2019d like to hear takes on. ",

I think they're technically a type of hearing aid.\u00a0\n\n\nBasically the only two solutions are auditory therapy or hearing aids.\u00a0\n\n\nThe only way you can know if it's APD as a symptom of ADHD or just APD unrelated to ADHD is if ADHD meds help your auditory processing. If they do, it's an ADHD symptom. If they don't, it's a separate condition.",
