As a child I was very talented and creative but now I can't do anything anymore. I just lie in my room and watch my life go to hell. I hardly have any friends and the ones that are still there I hate. I developed a severe binge eating disorder and lost all joy in life. Now I watch everyone else being happy and enjoying their fucking lives while I have become the biggest failure. ",

Don\u2019t focus on the past or compare yourself to others. Your current circumstances are unique, you haven\u2019t faced something like this yet and you don\u2019t know how to deal with it right now. Seeking help is not shameful, you deserve to live a happy life full of creativity. Knowing when to take a step back and ask for help is difficult, but you have already made the first step by recognizing how you\u2019re feeling. It is crucial that you don\u2019t do this alone, try to stick with any good friends you have. You are not the only person that feels this way, and you will overcome this. If you need to talk feel free to message me :)",
