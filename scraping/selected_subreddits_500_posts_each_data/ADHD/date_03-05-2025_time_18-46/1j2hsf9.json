    "selftext": "For me, my family believed I would become an expert in astronomy when I was in pre-school. And after I started going to school, they thought I would become a doctor or engineer. When I was doing my A Levels, they thought I would be a really good accountant and when I was in university, they thought I would be a manager. But now I am lost understanding what is my true interests are? I still and always love science/math topics, but in last 8 years or so, my hyperfixations are mostly about software development. I think I like that because there are endless things to self-learn in that field. How can I figure out which way to go and align my life around it?",
