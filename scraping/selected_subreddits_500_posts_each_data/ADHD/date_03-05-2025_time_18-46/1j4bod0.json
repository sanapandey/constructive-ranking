    "selftext": "It's been almost a months a since I've been diagnosed with ADHD and what I've realised is that my own nature now makes so much sense to me...\nI'm much more at peace with myself \n\nBut...\n\nAt the same time, I don't in actual sense don't know what am I doing and what interest do I actually want to pursue. \n\nCurrently I live in shared living situation and I barely get by with my current salary as a graphic designer.\nI know I'd do much better as a freelancer but I lack the discipline (obviously) as well as the confidence to do it.\n\nAnd on top of it all I can't seem to focus with all my interests piling up in my subconscious, it feels as if I get by 2 days with a good routine where I meditate, exercise and everything and the. I'm back to struggling to get off my bed the 3rd day.\n\nCurrently I'd somehow like to pursue creative coding, learning how to dj, learn how to be social and date more (haven't really had much dating life)\nAnd just be a different person and I know that I need to get a better place and get my career in line first but...\n\nIt's just that I don't really know how to do that..\n\nShould I change career, just live one day at a time right now and try learning new things everyday or struggle and force myself to do things that I'm not interested in, which is pretty much futile. \n\nI don't know what to do, help me. I get into tarots and they all tell me different things because I think my energy fluctuates so much that I don't know who I am anymore maybe.",

It feels like to me that your job is not motivating enough for you so your brain is trying to find that stimulation and motivation somewhere else. I had to try a few things to get to the right one - but when you find the right thing for you every little aspect of your life seems easier (waking up, getting ready, doing what you need even without a super structured work environment). I feel the place where I\u2019m at my best is work \ud83d\ude02 I get it, I can do it, I can feel good about myself. So maybe that\u2019s somewhere to start - looking for something slightly different? Maybe different structure/ environment/ creative content of the job? Saying that, I am a life long struggler with getting out of bed - although definitely having something good to look forward to helps!",

I gave up my first uni degree because I felt like I would never be happy doing that and would feel too much like a failure. So I literally gave up in my first year and found a new degree. That degree was amazing, I loved it, I did great. Then that opened doors to a slightly different thing - and I went and did that. I do always keep working so I don\u2019t just throw myself at things. But when I know I\u2019m not happy/stimulated I start looking at new possibilities - go for interviews. Just give it a go because it might bring unexpected happiness! I started in a classic sciences field and ended in healthcare and now higher education. It all made sense at each step and I\u2019m very happy now. I feel each part helps you understand more what you like and what you don\u2019t like. How your brain works better and how it really doesn\u2019t. So every experience is important",

So I\u2019ve started doing expectation management to myself. For example if I have 5 new ideas I know I will just keep 1 or 2 - but I accept it\u2019s ok to have loads of ideas and things to choose from later on. And that also not all project ideas will be good anyway - so I think about the various interests as a positive but fully knowing I will never do it all. I feel ADHd for me - being diagnosed as an adult as well - it\u2019s a lot about acceptance - accepting myself as I am and not feel guilty about every single \u201cfailure\u201d. So just to add that it\u2019s fine we can\u2019t do it all - no one can!",

I\u2019ve been in spirituality and healing and never ever got a good message about tarot cards. It\u2019ll mess up your energy even more and lead you to worse paths. If you crave anything spiritual read the Bible (new living translation version) or try to understand God through prayers. Don\u2019t wanna come off as \u201cthat Christian\u201d but it\u2019s genuinely what I\u2019ve learned from 8 years in the energy healing.\n\nI know a way of how to find your identity but I\u2019ll come off as \u201cthat Christian\u201d again so I\u2019ll let you ponder on that a bit. But I found a way that worked for me.\n\nAs for work, you need to be able to make a living. Find something you don\u2019t get repulsed by. That\u2019s an indicator of a good fitting work for you. If you can manage a week or a month and not get repulsed by it on though days I\u2019d say it\u2019s a keeper. You can try several jobs but the work market is really not good currently. So just keep doing what you do for now for a while maybe while trying out part time jobs.",
