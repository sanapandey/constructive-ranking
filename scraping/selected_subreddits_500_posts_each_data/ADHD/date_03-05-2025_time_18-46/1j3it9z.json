    "selftext": "I see a lot of posts about online doctors, but my situations a little different than just wanting to get meds fast online.\n\nI have been on various ADHD meds for ten years or so now, currently I\u2019m taking adderall XR. The first doctor to diagnose and help me with ADHD died five years ago and there\u2019s not a lot of doctors where I live, so it was hard finding another within a month to get my meds on time. \n\nSuddenly now the doctor I have been seeing since then \u201cunexpectedly retired\u201d out of nowhere. There are other doctors where he worked, but none are actual psychiatrists and gave me refills for this month and basically said I\u2019m on my own after that.\n\nSorry for the rant, but my question is are there any actual online services that have doctors that can actually help and not just hardcore push meds for profit? Every time I find one it seems sketchy and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just in my head. \n\nThank you. ",

Alternatively, look up practices on Google maps in that large city. Most have virtual options since the covid times. Providers are licensed at the state level, so you can be seen by any provider in the state.",
