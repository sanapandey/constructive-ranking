    "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019ve been prescribed 1mg of Intuniv a day and I\u2019m wondering when is the best time to take it? \n\nI\u2019ve been on Ritalin most recently which made me a complete tired, zombie person and dexamphetamine gave me so many side effects including insomnia and mad body pain\u2026 \n\nMy psych didn\u2019t specify whether to have it in the morning or afternoon and I\u2019m finding mixed messages online. \n\nAlso, shall I take it with food/high protein meal like the others? \n\nThanks so much guys! :)) ",
