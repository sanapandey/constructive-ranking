I am starting to talk with a therapist weekly to start the real work of treating my symptoms. \n\nI take Effexor for anxiety and depression, and have weaned it down to 75mg from 225mg. \n\nMy anxiety and mood is all over the place right now, and so are my adhd symptoms. \n\nIs now a good time to start adhd meds I?\nShould I wait? \nNot really sure what to do. Really appreciate any help. ",
