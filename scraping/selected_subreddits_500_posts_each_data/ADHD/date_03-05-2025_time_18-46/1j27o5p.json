If you have tried this medication, what was it like for you? Did you feel it actually helped your ADHD? I haven\u2019t really been on any other ADHD medication, or at least ADHD targeted, so I am curious how it works. Pros / cons? Any info is welcome! :)",

            "body": "It was the first thing I tried and the last thing I tried, a few years in between and a lot of other medications. \u00a0\n\nFor me it alone treated depression but not adhd, circle back the last thing I tried - while being on adderall reintroducing Wellbutrin made a great 1-2 punch that solved most problems. \u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what I did wrong and where I will caution you:\n\u00a0After the first month, once it starts working, you aren\u2019t \u201ccured\u201d and if you stop taking it , the problems come back. \u00a0 That\u2019s what happened to me, I did exactly that and sabotaged myself unknowingly. \u00a0 \u00a0If things get better, that means it\u2019s working and keep doing it. \u00a0\n\nLikely you\u2019re going to have some symptoms lift which is going to allow you to notice new symptoms to address in some fashion. \u00a0 Talk to your doc, take it slow, keep a journal or active tab and check in with yourself so you can look back and progress. \u00a0 \u00a0This journey is not a done-in-a-week sort of thing. \u00a0 It\u2019s a the rest of your life kind of thing. \u00a0 It might take months or years to figure out, but don\u2019t give up, and keep on going. \u00a0 \u00a0Also things change from time to time, you might have to switch meds or discontinue one or change doses. \u00a0 This is normal, we change as we age and our body responds to medicine different. \u00a0\n\nNo two are the same - just because one thing worked for me doesn\u2019t mean it will work for you. \u00a0Here\u2019s where I would advise caution. \u00a0 \u00a0 If something doesn\u2019t feel right, listen to your gut, call the doc and get a next day appointment. \u00a0 \u00a0I had a friend who tried a medication (prescribed by his doctor) and it made him feel absolutely terrible in so many ways. \u00a0 \u00a0The same medication was fine for me (at the time, not taking it anymore). \u00a0 We all have different chemical compositions.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, best of luck. \u00a0You likely won\u2019t feel anything overnight. \u00a0 Or this week, it takes about three weeks to saturate properly I was told. \u00a0 \u00a0So likely if you\u2019re paying attention you\u2019ll notice around the three week mark. \u00a0\n\nWhat did \u201cfeel\u201d like for me? \u00a0 Well, in my experience it means much more stability. \u00a0 Much higher lows and lower highs. \u00a0 Instead of my world existing in catastrophic depression and absolute bliss (-100 to 100) everything is \u201cokay\u201d (1-10) and for this I am so grateful. \u00a0 I look back and think about the extreme mood swings or manias I would get in and am so glad to not be wrestling with them. \u00a0 Some people say it takes the \u201cedge\u201d off and I\u2019m okay with that. \u00a0 \u00a0I don\u2019t like those highs, I don\u2019t like those lows, I just want to be right here in the middle and content right where I am. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s what caused me to stop it at first. \u00a0I felt like I couldn\u2019t feel, that I wasn\u2019t \u201cme\u201d. \u00a0And to some extent that was true - but it took me years to realize that I\u2019d rather not feel and not be depressed , that those manic highs and euphoric moments weren\u2019t worth it, to find peace and happiness in the normal every day life.\u00a0\n\nTo put it simply, before, my emotions controlled me and dictated my life.\u00a0\n\nNow I am in control of my life and my emotions aren\u2019t dictating my actions. \u00a0\n\nI hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions or probe. \u00a0 I\u2019m an open book, I\u2019ve got plenty of stories, happy ones, sad ones, whatever and love to share and connect.\u00a0",

A couple months after going off it, my doctor suggested I get tested for ADHD. Turns out the Wellbutrin had been alleviating some of my worst ADHD symptoms. So, it seems that it can be an effective treatment for some. I recently started guanfacine which is another non-stimulant treatment. So far it's too soon to tell if it's effective.\u00a0",

Doc just upped it to 300mg about six weeks ago, and it was a profound change for the better. So while Wellbutrin has improved a lot of things that I think exacerbate ADHD symptoms, it hasn\u2019t really helped at all with Executive Function, time blindness, stuff like that.

What side of the fence your doc is on, who knows.\n\nThat being said, trying and titrating dosages of medications is a big part of the early ADHD treatment journey.\n\nJust try it, tell your doc what it helps with and what it doesn\u2019t, and if it\u2019s not helping with ADHD, Expect to move on to stimulants next.\n\nUnsolicited advice, pair up your new meds with therapy for ADHD or going to some groups or something, mainly because the only way you\u2019ll truly  control it is to have the meds AND the skills and strategies. Otherwise you\u2019ll be one of those people on insanely high dosages because the only time it \u201cworks\u201d for you is when you take so much to soar and get in to hyperfocus.\n\nIf you get your strategies and coping mechanisms in place , you\u2019ll be able to have a lower dosage, stay more consistent and make it to a calm, predictable and relaxing life that usually alludes us",

None of my doctors then or since have heard of anything like that before, but all have agreed that it was almost definitely a reaction to the Wellbutrin.
