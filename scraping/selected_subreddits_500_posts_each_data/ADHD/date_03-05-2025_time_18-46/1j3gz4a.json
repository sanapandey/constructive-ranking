    "selftext": "By now, I have all sorts of constellations of shame surrounding cleaning and doing routine/daily chores. Like many of us - it takes a friend currently being on the way to my home for my brain to signal the urgency to clean - and then I knock out months worth of clutter in 20min. My mess accumulates in the exact same way it did when I was 9 years old. From what's been explained by leading ADHD experts, the anxiety that trails my ADHD through adulthood only makes it worse. And I don't think it's depression mess. I bet I fall into the 5-10% of worst cases. There have been streaks of cleanliness - but not enough. \n\nDid any of you ever just give up and throw in the towel and now pay for a cleaner all the time? Because I've always aspired to tackling and overcoming the issue and it just hasn't happened and I'm 38.\n\nIt could be what I'm currently prescribed, but I think my brain just sucks at cleaning...  I always talk myself out of it, feel a crazy amount of shyness, or space out and start something new. I'm thankful that I can articulate the problem now.   Currently I am in the process of switching from Concerta to Vyvanse through my doctor to see if it helps my executive function. There is no significant other currently but when there is one obviously I don't want to have the problem anymore.\n\nLike me, countless other ADHDers have explained how we will start a load of laundry but it never makes it into the dryer. When you wash a load 4 times and that's happened like every other time for decades...it's not good. I end up just washing my work uniform when it's urgent and I'm fortunate to have washer and dryer in this city apartment because the only bright side to this story is my laundry is always clean, albeit scattered throughout on the \"floordrobe.\"\n\nInterested in hearing from some of you messy monsters. I'll hold off on telling war stories of how bad it truly gets - just wanted to see if others have a large impairment in this area.",

The only difference between a direct exchange and using currency is that currency means I don't have to go shopping for a carpenter who luckily needs exactly my service. I can provide my service to whoever needs it,receive a fungible store of value, and then use it to compensate the carpenter who in turn can use it to exchange for whatever service he needs.\n\nThat's not capitalism, it's just really simple economics.",

The result was that the day before we were running around the tidy everything up so that the floor can be mopped, the kitchen cleaned and the bathrooms cleaned, because those are the things we really loathe. \nIt's a bit like a friend calls to come over and you switch to a panic cleaning mode to give the (false) impression your house isn't that messy. So yeah, it works, but it can be stressful. \nEventually we stopped using the services, because it gave us a bit too much stress and can get expensive. We did stick to a routine by planning different cleaning chores in a shared calendar, but we also bought a robot vacuum cleaner that also mops the floor which is the best thing I bought in years.",
