    "selftext": "I have a damn samsung 2021 tablet (It's fucking embarrassing, cant even fit it in my pocket) and knowing how much I'm going to be IN DANGER soon if i don't get a phone on my parents or my own phone plan/mobile data with a phone number, it's terrifying.\n\nI have problems. Imagine not being able to call any help when an urgent emergency happens. That time it should basically be illegal to not have a phone!! And if you ever get lost, you're going to have to call your parents or you're fucking stuck there.\n\nI can imagine them waiting longer to get me a phone, but at least like not even a older phone for calls and messages for help and shit? It's actually crazy. I'm envious of them enjoying their phones and data wherever they want. I'm fucking envious and pissed.\n\nEven all the phones I've had never had any phone numbers.\n\nI hope you adults are enjoying yourselves paying your own bills and getting everything you want.",

If you're in high school and doing activities outside of normal school hours that are unsupervised, like say, going to the cinema or arcade or laser tag without adults (I'm 24 and I already don't know what's cool), then yes you should probably have a phone.\n\nIf your just attending school, being picked up and dropped off by a parent or school bus, and otherwise just hanging out with friends online or supervised, you shouldn't need a phone.\n\nMost phones these days give you 24/7 access to the internet, which is a blessing and a curse. I'm not going to give you the boomer \"social media is bad\" talk that a lot of adults are throwing out with poor scientific backing, but there's no need to rush into phone ownership.\n\nIf you are in a situation at school or in clubs, ect.. where you feel you can't trust people enough to ask to borrow their phone for an emergency call, then you should definitely discuss this with a guardian or trusted adult.\n\nYou should also try to memorise at least one of your parents/guardians phone numbers, so you can give that number if needed.\n\n\nPS\nA lot of people often say being a kid is great, truth is it can suck, small things can overwhelm. Yes there will be advantages to growing old, but old anxieties will be replaced with new ones also. Don't be in a rush to grow up.",

It\u2019s also fair to point out that when I was a kid I was taught what to do without access to a phone- maybe ask your parents about that? Like what can they recommend exactly that would help you feel better about any scary situations you might face.",

Also, enjoy the time in your life when you think adults who pay their own bills get whatever they want\u2026. You only have a short period of time left until you realize that\u2019s not really true in today\u2019s economy. Paying your bills just means you\u2019re surviving these days. We make decent money and still can\u2019t get what we want and even most of what we need.",
