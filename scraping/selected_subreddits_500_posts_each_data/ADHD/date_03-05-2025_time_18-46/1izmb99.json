Other studies suggest the medications may increase the risk for glaucoma.   The problem with the studies that report these findings is that they cannot establish causality.  Given that the medications have very strong effects for improving a person's life, most clinicians view those benefits as outweighing other small, uncertain risks.",

'mixed' or 'combined' means that both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present.  It is the most common form of ADHD.  We call these 'presentations', not 'types' because they can change over time.    The combined presentation of ADHD is usually more severe in the sense that the patient has more problems in living than the other type.  That is because they have more symptoms of ADHD.  The good news is that combined ADHD responds as well to treatments for ADHD as the other presentations.",

In such cases naps can be restorative.    For some people with ADHD, cognitive fatigue is simply boredom.  Even when one is not sleepy, it is more difficult to engage in a task that is not  rewarding.  Since people diagnosed with ADHD often experience shifts in rewardingness, that can lead to the type of fatigue you describe.",

But it is not clear if this is a physiological effect (e.g., a change in brain chemistry) or is due to a change in the person's environment.  For example, if one's life presents more challenges, eg., due to the birth of a child, a new job, etc...,  the original dose of medication may not be sufficient to deal with new symptoms of ADHD.",
