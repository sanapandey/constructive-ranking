I\u2019ve noticed some mornings I have anxiety, or depression gets worse.\n\nNot sure if it\u2019s the adderall or something else.\n\nI\u2019ve suffered on and off with both depression and anxiety for years. So, I was wondering if any of you knew, or happened to have the same issue?\n\nCan you please help me out here?\n\nThank you\n",
