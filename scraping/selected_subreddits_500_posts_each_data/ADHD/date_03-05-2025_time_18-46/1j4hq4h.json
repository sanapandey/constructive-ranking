    "selftext": "I just saw a meme mocking people who struggle to do dishes due to ADHD. Until recently, I was in that situation. My boyfriend helped, and I never left them for more than a week, but that made me wonder again-was I just lazy? Did I annoy my flatmates? Eventhough I know that ADHD can cause executive dysfunction, that 'I am lazy' feeling hurts and doesn't seem to go away completely.",
