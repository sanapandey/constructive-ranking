Please, if you're in the US take some time to read the regulation or ask ChatGPT to summarize it for you. If this rule goes into effect as-written, it would have a huge impact on rural or disabled people's ability to access appropriate mental health care.\n\nComments are publicly visible, and you can browse through them to see how thousands of health care providers and patients have commented on the drastic effect this would have on access to care. I wish that the Federal rulemaking process was taught in high school civics classes so more people understood just how important the public comment period can be and the real impact that your voice can have on proposed regulations.",

The rule would only require one in-person visit. \n\nI feel like if a provider is allowed to prescribe it in-person then they should be able to prescribe it for their patients via telemedicine. This rule proposes restricting access to a very small pool of prescribers. The biggest issue is the \"Advanced Telemedicine Prescribing Registration\" described [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-01099/p-144):\n\n> DEA has determined that certain specialized physicians and board-certified mid-level practitioners have a legitimate need to prescribe Schedule II controlled substances via telemedicine when treating particularly vulnerable patient populations. **Such authorization is reserved only for the most compelling use cases**, ensuring that Schedule II prescribing via telemedicine is used only when necessary. \n\n> Consistent with these concerns regarding vulnerable patient populations, and cognizant of the high potential for abuse that exists for Schedule II controlled substances, DEA has determined that only certain specialized physicians and board-certified mid-level practitioners have a legitimate need for the  Advanced Telemedicine Prescribing Registration, in the following limited circumstances or practice specialties:\n\n> (1) psychiatrists;\n\n> (2) hospice care physicians;\n\n> (3) palliative care physicians;\n\n> (4) physicians rendering treatment at long term care facilities;\n\n> (5) pediatricians;\n\n> (6) neurologists; and\n\n> (7) mid-level practitioners and physicians from other specialties who are board certified in the treatment of psychiatric or psychological disorders, hospice care, palliative care, pediatric care, or neurological disorders unrelated to the treatment and management of pain.\n\n> The type of specialized practitioners and board-certified mid-level practitioners eligible for the Advanced Telemedicine Prescribing Registration typically treat patients that face significant healthcare accessibility challenges, and, in some cases, who suffer from particularly debilitating or terminal illnesses. The hardships faced by such patients were discussed at length by certain speakers during the Telemedicine Listening Sessions. For example, some speakers discussed accessibility issues created by shortages of psychiatrists, and the need for qualified, perhaps board-certified, psychiatrists to diagnose and treat illnesses like ADHD.",

The allegation is that these services were getting family practice doctors to prescribe adhd meds in a volume kind of business. The government alleges that these practitioners don\u2019t have the expertise to remotely assess adhd. \n\nNow it\u2019s all well and fine to disagree with the governments assessment, but the original post doesn\u2019t capture the reality of the proposed rule making. Most people do not get their rx from telemedicine providers, as per the rule making document. \n\nAnd like I said, if you\u2019ve ever seen your prescriber even once at any point in your relationship it doesn\u2019t apply to you.",
