    "selftext": "I take 30mg of Amphetamine Salts XR daily, sometimes a 10mg booster in the afternoon. I have hypothyroidism, fluid retention (triamterene helps), hypermobility (possibly EDS), cervical instability (neck/back pain, numbness, tingling), and constant tinnitus. Fun times.\n\nI work as a contractor with nonprofits and started my own business in December after years in the nonprofit sector. I love what I do but struggle with boundaries\u2014I have a hard time saying no when people need help.\n\nToday has been awful. I have multiple projects, emails, house tasks, event planning, and travel prep\u2014but when I tried to make a list this morning, my brain just went blank. Total shutdown. I cried. I\u2019ve chipped away at things but still feel like I\u2019m missing so much, and now my kid is home, so my work time is over for the day.\n\nIs this just how it is? I\u2019m so frustrated. How do I get unstuck when my brain refuses to cooperate?",

            "body": "I make such a strong use of lists, calendars, and mind maps. I may not have it quite as rough as you do, but I'm a married guy with a young kid and a software engineer, so there's always plenty of things going on. I have a lot of the same struggles that you do too, so my \"solutions\" aren't really solutions, but rather things that I find help some sometimes.\n\nTicktick is an amazing app, as it works on desktop, web, or mobile. You can add things to your list as soon as you think about them wherever you are. It can connect to calendars and show your things on there and offer reminders and such. You can even take notes in it.\n\nMind mapping was another thing that I fairly recently learned about that was a huge help to me as someone with ADHD. There are apps out there, but a piece of paper can work just as well, really.",
