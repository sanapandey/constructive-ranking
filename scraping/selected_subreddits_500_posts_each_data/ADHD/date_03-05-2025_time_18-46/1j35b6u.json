    "selftext": "I just wanted to ask whether anybody knows how long the NHS wait times are at the moment? I already have a private diagnosis and am on shared care with that, but have asked to be referred by my GP so I don't have to pay private prices for consultations. I'm not hopeful about the wait times but just wanted an estimate if anybody has that?",

It's like \u00a3175 per appointment, so I've been referred so I can get an NHS phychiatrist instead.",
