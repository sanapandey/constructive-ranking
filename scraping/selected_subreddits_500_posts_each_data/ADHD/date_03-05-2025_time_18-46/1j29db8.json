    "selftext": "I got diagnosed with inattentive adhd a couple weeks ago and was put on 36 mg of concerta. I started it and was amazed at how focused I could be. I lived my whole life struggling through zoning out and now I finally didn\u2019t have to shake myself back into the room. However, now I find myself zoning out again. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019ve never taken it. I\u2019m so confused about it, does this mean I need a higher dose?",

            "body": "A couple of things: 1) I found when I started on medication that I immediately felt \u201czoned in.\u201d  And that\u2019s what made the newly medicated state really wonderful. Over time, though, that initial feeling can fade. The trick is to start to apply discipline and concentration to the time you are medicated. For instance, a lot of people will point out that if they start work or form a firm plan before they take their medication, they will work with focus when the medication kicks in. However, if they don\u2019t have a plan, they will just zone out and scroll while on medication. Don\u2019t let medication drive the bus. But leverage medication to drive the bus better. It is something you will have to work at.  2) it\u2019s possible you have the wrong medication. Concerta worked just okay for me at first, though certainly better than nothing. But I did feel myself kinda zoning out. The biggest effect for me was that I would lose words. Others have talked about that problem. Adderall is a much better fit for me. With Adderall, though, I have to remember my first point:  medication is like crutches. They prop you up, but you need to push yourself forward.",

I think it\u2019s why we don\u2019t get addicted and even often forget to take it regularly. I remember taking prescribed oxycodone after a major surgery and it always felt that great, utterly terrifying.",
