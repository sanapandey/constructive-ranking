I don\u2019t think it matters, we\u2019re paying for an education and with ADHD sometimes we just learn a bit differently, the main thing is we are getting the most out of the course so I think it\u2019s totally fine however it is you may do that.",

ADHD is a disability, and a common accomodation they offer is for them to provide course notes for you. They'd probably hire one of your fellow students to share their notes.",

I get that those small numbers form a base that makes the rest easy but that didn't work for me. I needed to learn to math.\n\nSame here. I think you just need to make sure that you're actually learning the content, whatever it is. Forget whether or not it's cheating. You just need to be making sure that the college experience isn't a waste (because it's so damned expensive and hopefully is providing your life some value). If this is what you need to do, do it. Just make sure that, especially if it's something related to your major, you're actually learning it.",

And if my textbook doesn't have good enough examples - I google. It's not cheating - I'm researching - It's like asking a professor a question.

The ability to link all those examples together in a cohesive thought is what earns you the grade. Especially when you are also incorporating your own personal thought to bring everything together. \n\nOne last thing, I'm a virtual student that doesn't have live lectures - sometimes we have recorded lectures - but most of the time we just have powerpoints as lectures and that's it.

That is a huge difference.\n\nI don't know the course or the subject but the higher in educations you get more and more into understanding and reasoning. Especially when you get into writing stuff.\n\n>but my notes never make sense because i rush to write it all down or else i cannot keep up with the lecture, besides, i cant multitask so even just writing alone i will forget everything he says. \n\nI think you should look into efficient notetaking. Because you are saying it yourself that you don't get anything from the way you are doing it right now.\n\nTry sitting and listen to the lecture next time. But this time just write down things that you don't understand in like \"Chromodynamics?\", and then after you go figure it out. Or ask in class.  \nAnother way I like is writing down the essence of something, like \"1/\u03c3^2 => the smaller variance means more information in the statistics\". This is from a lecture that I had today, and that was like half of the lecture. Then I check to see if I understand that correctly.  \nThis means sometimes my notes are just two sentences for a whole lecture, sometimes there are 2 full pages.\n\nSometimes I rewrite them afterwards and sometimes I don't. Sometimes I start working with them immediately, like writing something or do some programming or calculations.\n\n...and I did learn this the hard way. I did well in school and a while in the university. But after a while it got to hard to just wing it. Then, crash... now I am a Ph.D student. And it is hard again, but in a new way.",
