    "selftext": "Hello,  I read posts here to know how to best help my son.  He's a freshman,  no phones allowed in classes, but you tube is not blocked on their school laptops.  He has high cognitive ability with ADHD and GAD. He takes medication,  gets counseling as needed,  and takes an additional study hall in his schedule specifically for executive function and extra work completion.  We were stymied when he was coming off of track practice with hours of homework.  25% of his schedule is potential study hall! He finally told us he just sits on you tube - no sound,  just captions- for most of the school day.  Any recent grads have any tips? How does someone with ADHD manage having you tube a click away at all times? Both my husband and I would not have been able to handle it,  but we are old enough not to have had to deal with it.  ",
