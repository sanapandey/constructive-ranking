    "selftext": "I have always struggled because I usually have to decide between seeing all the small details of a subject or seeing the big picture. This was especially a problem in history class, which I sort of worked around by memorizing how the teacher told us the details related to the big picture. But I often struggled understanding how individual events and situations led to big things like wars. \n\nNow I\u2019m a SWE and it\u2019s the same thing. I\u2019m trying to become proficient in a new part of our codebase. My boss is super kind and helped walk me through the process. It feels like I can either see the steps or the end goal but not both at once. It\u2019s like seeing just the 2D magic eye pattern or seeing just the plain 3D image (like they show at the back of the books) but not actually being able to get the pattern to overlap and truly see the image as it was intended. (Ironically I\u2019m freakishly good at magic eye puzzles.)\n\nAnyone relate?",
