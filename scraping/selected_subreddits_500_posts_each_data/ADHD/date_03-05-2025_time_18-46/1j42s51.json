    "selftext": "I am late DX autistic and am soon to undergo my main ADHD assessment in Wales.\n\nI had my pre assessment a few days ago, which was like an hour of questions.\n\nThe consultant said she thinks I am highly likely ADHD, and that I will be called back for the main long assessment in 4 to 6 months.\n\nI am asked what to expect as I get anxious about any ambiguities and unknowns - however, she just said it's a looooonng assessment but it will be completed on that day.\n\nCan anyone give me an idea of what to expect? I am not after specifics, just kind of what format it is and how long.\n\n",
