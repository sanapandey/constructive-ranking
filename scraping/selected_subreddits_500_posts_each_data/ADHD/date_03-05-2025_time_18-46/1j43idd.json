    "selftext": "So after 35 years I finally made the decision to try medication. In January they put me on 5 mg of Ritalin three times a day. I felt a tiny bit of help with my executive dysfunction I think. After several appointments and adjustments, I'm now up to 20 mg three times a day. I'm still not feeling a whole lot of anything and I think that help with executive dysfunction is more a byproduct of me just overthinking things. I've heard and read that obviously medications affect different people differently and I'm wondering if anybody has any experience with this and if maybe I would have better luck on a different medication. And also how I would go about talking to my doctor about this. Any advice anybody has would be really helpful. I come from a family with a history of drug use so making the decision to use medication was a huge step for me and I'm having this weird feeling where because this medication isn't working for me, I'm a failure for it. I don't know.",

It\u2019s a huge step, and the last thing you want is to feel like it\u2019s not working. But honestly, the fact that you\u2019re not feeling much on 20mg three times a day is actually really useful information\u2014it means this specific med (or dosage) might not be the right fit, and that\u2019s completely normal.\n\nA lot of people go through trial and error with ADHD meds. Some respond better to Ritalin (methylphenidate-based), while others do better on Adderall, Vyvanse, or even non-stimulants like Strattera. If Ritalin isn\u2019t giving you noticeable benefits, it\u2019s worth bringing up with your doctor. Just be direct: \u201cI\u2019ve increased the dose, but I\u2019m not feeling significant improvements. Are there alternative medications or approaches we could try?\u201d A good doctor should be open to adjusting based on your experience.\n\nAnd you are absolutely not a failure for this. Meds are just one piece of the puzzle, and finding the right one can take time. If this resonates with you, this video really captures what it\u2019s like to navigate ADHD meds and the whole trial-and-error process: https://youtu.be/bQ_wDpISzGY. Hope it helps, and hang in there!",
