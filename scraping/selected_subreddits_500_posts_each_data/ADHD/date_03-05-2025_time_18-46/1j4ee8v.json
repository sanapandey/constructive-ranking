I can't hold a train of thought and all my traits and symptoms are so heightened I feel like I'm heading for an implosion.\n\nMy usual go to for stimming would be some kind of masturbation or scrolling but nothing is helping me bring it down tonight. Does anyone have practised techniques that they can share to help me please?\n\nI can't talk to anyone face to face because I feel so withdrawn.",
