            "body": "I think there's been some miscommunication here, you need your GP to refer you, so they would need to have a reason to refer you. Normally you'd have an appointment with them, you'd tell them why you think you have ADHD/would like to go for assessment. If they believe there's a possibility they should then refer you because they are unable to diagnose you.\n\nBut simply put, no, you do not need a diagnosis, the RTC route is your right to choose your provider who carries out your assessment to get your diagnosis.\n\nBest steps to take is to decide which provider you want to use and print off/download all the documents you & your GP are required to complete for your referral.  Next book an appointment with your GP and explain why you want the assessment, if they agree they can fill out the forms for you and get these sent off. Ask your GP to send you written/email evidence to prove they have done this. Sadly other redditors have found out months down the line they were never actually referred, so good to have a paper trail.\n\nGood luck!",

RTC is literally in place to get a diagnosis... otherwise why would you need it if you're already diagnosed?\n\nPush back to your GP, some won't do it at all so if that's the case, you'll need to move practices.",
