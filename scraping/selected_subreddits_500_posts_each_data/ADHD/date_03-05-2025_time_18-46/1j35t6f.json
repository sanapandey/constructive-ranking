Late\u2705\nGetting up at the last possible minute so in theory everything goes your way but in practice factors you didn\u2019t consider happening that always end up messing you up but you forget them every single time for some reason happen and ruin your theoretical calculations?\u2705\nI\u2019m going to be late to work again?\u2705\nAlso lost my second work ID?\u2705\nForgot to take my supplements that help me manage this condition?\u2705\n\nYou know one thing about having ADHD is you feel it no matter no matter what. When it feels like a blessing, it\u2019s great but when it feels like a curse it feels like the worst curse known to man. \n\nWhy is it we manage something for 2-4 days but then we inevitably slip back? I\u2019m really annoyed and angry.",
