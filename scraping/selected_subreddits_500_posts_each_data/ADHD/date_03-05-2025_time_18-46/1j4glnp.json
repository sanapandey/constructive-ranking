    "selftext": "Admin please delete if not allowed; but this month upon trying to get my prescription filled I was met with a whopping $390 price tag, because CVS told me that they no longer accept coupons for controlled substances. I\u2019m not sure if this is just my local CVS, or something that is just state wide, but I am posting this to engage in conversation and ask if anyone else has come across this issue? Also to possibly suggest to those who plan to use a goodrx coupon to fill their meds at a CVS in the near future, that they might want to call and confirm that it will still be taken ahead of time. This completely hit me out of the blue, after switching back over to them and not filled with them for a little while. ",
