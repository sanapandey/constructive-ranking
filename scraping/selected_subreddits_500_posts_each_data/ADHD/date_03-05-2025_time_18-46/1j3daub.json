    "selftext": "Hi! I have been on 40mg vyvanse for a long time. I asked my doctor to raise it due to issues focusing at work. I went up to 50mg. I was feeling good at work, but my irritability went up, and I was feeling generally nervous/anxious. It was like there was a buzzing in my head that never went away. Now I\u2019m back to trying the 40mg dose again and I can\u2019t do ANYTHING at work today or yesterday, but the anxiety is better. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I do not have a psychiatrist so my gp is making my med adjustments. \n\nDo you think once I get used to 40mg again I\u2019ll be able to do my job? Or am I fucked? \n\nThanks!",

            "body": "Hi!! I found that I work best with 50mg per day, 30mg in the morning and 20mg as needed between 11am-noon. I've been taking Vyvanse for 9 months. Taking 40mg-50mg all at once was too much for me (made me anxious & jittery), but 30mg wasn't quite cutting it- it wasn't enough to sustain productivity all day and I would crash emotionally around 5 or 6pm. I talked to my doctor and he suggested splitting 50mg into two doses, and I have really enjoyed this solution because the second dose gives me a good boost of energy and focus, allowing me to be much more successful in the afternoons/ evenings when I still need to be \"on\"- whether at work or at social functions. I also don't find that I need to take my mid-day dose every day if I don't feel like it, on the weekends I rarely take it, and I enjoy being able to have this flexibility. The only main concern is taking it later in the day may affect your sleep, for me it does keep me up if I'm not physically active that day, but I don't have difficulty falling asleep if my body is physically tired.",
