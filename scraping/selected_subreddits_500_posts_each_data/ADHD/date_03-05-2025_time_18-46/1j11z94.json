I've had like 15 of them (I'm 20 y.o.) and it never worked. It's a miracle that I remember to note the most important events in calendar on my phone...\n\nAnd I get that sometimes they just want to help and genuinely cares about me, but I've heard it like a thousand times already...\n\nDo you have any \"pro-tips\" that just annoy you? I'm really curious!",

I'll get a new game and plan on playing it as soon as I get off work.    I'll even tell my girlfriend that I plan on gaming for a few hours.   Then when I get home I end up just kind of hanging out until it's too late to start gaming.  Sometimes I go so far as doing chores instead of starting the fucking game.   If you don't believe me just look at all of the games in my Steam library with zero hours played.",

About 5 of them told me I should start a business and I was like nah, this is fun for me, it's relaxing turning it into a job would take that away. \n\nOne was very insistent and pushy. I had to tell them look I have ADHD I'd be homeless if it was in my hands to find my own work along with all the other things that come with owning your own business. I need the motivation of an external source that also provides a steady stream of income. So yes I COULD make more money starting a business than what I earn now, but the stress I'd put on myself and the more than likely failure is not worth it....that shut them up but why can't they just take the sort answer?!?!",

I sort my clean laundry into unfolded piles for each person in the hallway at first and put socks, underwear, boxers, bras into a small basket to pick out of. It\u2019s better than the big doom pile of collective laundry to dig through that was happening! To me, sorting it into piles made me feel like I found a solution that may not be the perfect solution, but made things easier a little bit. \n\nMy thoughts are that this half ass way of \u201cfolding\u201d or managing the clean laundry into piles may still be a cluster fuck, but it\u2019s lesser of a cluster fuck to pick a shirt out of your own separate clean laundry pile than having to dig through one massive doom pile of EVERYONES shit. Ugh.\n\nI get shit for this a lot but it\u2019s the better alternative IMO and things still eventually get put away. It just might take a few days. And then the piles are back a few days later. But who is it hurting? At LeAsT We HaVe ClEaN cLOtHeS!\n\nAnd, not to mention, the likelihood of it getting put away faster is significantly higher when it\u2019s already sorted into piles. \n\nBut I still find my partner angrily kicking piles out of the way, fucking them up (i\u2019ve literally had to say \u2018please don\u2019t fuck with my process\u2019 when he does this), even though they\u2019re nice and neat piles and clearly better than the alternative. \n\nIt\u2019s So frustrating and defeating when you try to find an accommodation or some way to make some seemingly impossible task a bit easier and doable and people criticize you for it and still make you feel lazy like you\u2019re not doing things right.",

If it\u2019s someone I know, I can\u2019t pick it up if someone\u2019s calling me and I can\u2019t call them back. Just text me! Bc talking on the phone gives me extreme anxiety.\n\nI\u2019m constantly pushed by my mom to call my grandma. Always lecturing me even though I\u2019m 43 years old lol about how I need to do this and do that and keep in contact with my grandma and she loves me blah blah blah. She\u2019s actually been pretty shitty to me my whole life here and there, but calling literally anyone on the phone besides businesses has always caused me such high stress, it\u2019s irrational. so especially calling my less than kind grandmother is going to induce a near panic attack. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure this is one of my ADHD traits. And not just my personality or me not wanting to talk to the person as I\u2019ve been accused of in the past. \n\nI\u2019ll meet my grandma for breakfast once a week SURE!, but can I call her once a month? Nope! No clue why it\u2019s THAT hard, but it just IS! Just gives me anxiety and makes me feel horrendously uncomfortable.",

The most simplified and distilled way I could describe our solution is that I tell her, \"Help me build and maintain good habits and processes.\"\n\nI can, and do, accomplish ridiculous amounts of work in a very short time. When I'm medicated, and I'm not distracted by internal thoughts or external stimulus. \n\nWe've been together 16yrs, married 14, and I've been diagnosed for 11 or 12yrs. Even as recent as last night, I had to remind her that sending me FB reels, YouTube shorts, etc. before I'm lying down in bed just wrecks my focus and momentum for getting the house shut down for the night. It's counterproductive. So we work on things like that. \n\nAlso, we both recognize that reminders, patterns of behavior, stimulus response, etc. can change over time. I get accustomed to my audible alarm for the morning, so every few months I need to change it to something drastically different. Or I'll have a good habit reinforced and built up for months, I'll have that process get interrupted and lose the pattern. Getting that pattern back isn't as simple as \"just start doing it again\", there's the inertia to overcome, dealing with bad habits that might have crept in, etc. \n\nI also found a counselor who was very focused and knowledgeable about ADHD. I saw him maybe 6-7 times by myself, and then had my wife come as well, so she could bring up issues that she was having regarding my symptoms. Having the counselor there to explain things directly, provide an uninvolved 3rd party to mediate as needed, and provide insight from his experience had a massive positive impact.",

I won\u2019t do it justice but I\u2019ve paraphrased below.\n\nEveryone has moments where they don\u2019t feel like getting up off the couch to do the dishes. In fact, lots of people always feel that way. But for someone with ADHD, they might really want to do the dishes, to the point of stressing them out, but the thought of getting up and doing it is overwhelmingly negative and even more stressful. Or they might totally forget that the dishes exist, until they see them at a really inopportune time. Then they might leave them and they pile up, or they might be filled with an unignorable need to do them and end up being late for work. \n\nThe idea is that from an outside perspective, it looks like that person just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do the dishes. But for the one with ADHD, there is an inner turmoil that those without it don\u2019t have. \n\nIs it true? It definitely is for me. If I have medication, I don\u2019t necessarily jump up to do the dishes. But it\u2019s not hard for me to take a break then go, ok let\u2019s do it now rather than later.

I also keep ready to eat meal and snack options, and caffeine options, at hand in my personal vehicle and my work truck. \n\nI can't pull that shit when it involves getting the kids ready and out the door on time, they need time to go to the bathroom, get dressed or get winter layers on, etc.",

Like yes, everyone gets depressed every once in a while but that is not the same as a person with depression, everyone gets anxious once in a while but that is not the same as having anxiety, and everyone has trouble focusing or gets overwhelmed every once in a while but that is not the same as having ADHD. \n\nWhen people say things like that to me I ask them if they\u2019ve ever hyperventilated, or felt so anxious that they\u2019re dizzy. If they haven\u2019t I ask them to go back to the time in their life that they\u2019ve been the most anxious or stressed. Then I tell them that having anxiety is having that level of mental distress every week. \n\nI think ADHD is harder to explain to people, and for some reason harder to accept parts of in ourselves because most people HAVENT ever felt so overwhelmed that they can\u2019t move or think. Most people without ADHD haven\u2019t felt anything resembling the need to move or the wrenching of their brain from one task onto another. \n\nI also think that it\u2019s tough because ADHD looks vastly different from person to person and that\u2019s a new thing that our society as a whole is learning. In short, yeah, everyone does experiences SOME of the things that we do- but they aren\u2019t as intense, and they aren\u2019t as frequent.

As a preteen I upgraded to a baby-G shock watch with like 20 different alarms I could and did set, and it'd hold a bunch of phone numbers too (pre common cellphone days) for when I needed to call someone from a payphone. Now I've got a Samsung smart watch. It buzzes me every hour and when my set phone alarms go off.

I have good and bad days. And being in perimenopause means I have less estrogen and my meds are less effective. Gtfoh.   \n\n\"Pick up the pace.\"   \nIf I could I would. I *hate* spending my entire day on one thing. I *hate* being the last one done. But these executive function dysfunctions mean that I have to double and triple check everything. Especially if numbers are involved. I promise, once it's routine and I can get into the flow, I'll be the first one done and it'll be the best you've ever seen. But until then, I'm a slow, bumbling, tire fire. My learning process is slow and ugly.  \n\nI'm 40 and was dx in 1993. First girl in my school district. I could go on with aggravating advice all day.

            "body": "*\"You're just using ADHD as an excuse.\"*\n\nI had someone whom I had recently become close with and I thought had been understanding of my situation as I started to reveal more tell me recently, that to him \"ADHD is like the common cold: everyone has it\".\n\nHe went on to explain how he has many friends that have been diagnosed and they all use it as an excuse to be shitty to people, not get a job, or still live with their parents. In his opinion, I also use it as an excuse because everytime I have a problem or struggle with something, I bring up having ADHD.\n\nThe most recent example was when I locked my keys in my locker at the gym..the keys to the locker. He helped to fish the keys out through the vent hols in the front, which I appreciated, but later said he was disappointed in me for blaming that event on ADHD. He had criticized me, at the time, of even using the locker because \"I was afraid somebody would steal from me\". \n\nI explained to him that using the locker was more about having a routine to ensure that I know where everything is. I went into some detail about how I lock the padlock to the s-carabiner to the right of the keys so that I could get the lock off of the carabiner without having to first remove the keys. This is my life: I have little routines for everything so that I don't lose stuff and can remember to be places where I am supposed to be at the times I am supposed to be there.\n\nHe said, \"It's not ADHD, man; you just made a mistake.\" I tried to explain that I completely understood his perspective, especially in the context of his friends' behavior and how he has been driven to success in his life. But he was only seeing that one event, and didn't see the literally dozen other times I had done the same damned thing already that day, and it gets frustrating not being able to find your keys/phone/wallet/pen/tools/book/whatever that you JUST HAD IN YOUR HAND.\n\nIn the end, it made no difference. Even though he couldn't really explain why he viewed blaming ADHD as a problem, \"what is the harm?\" I asked. \"I am not being a shitty person like your friends. I am have a job; I pay (most) of my bills on time; I am a responsible adult that just has to use systems in order to function in the most basic capacity.\"\n\nIt is endlessly frustrating to me how common it is for people to be dismissive of the things that they cannot see or experience for themselves. He has no frame of reference; it is not useful to explain that I have been formally diagnosed THREE different times in my life, or that difference in ADHD brains are visible on fMRI scans. If you are not a person with a clear physical deformity or missing an entire leg, there is zero reason why you can't climb the stairs and whatever you say is just an excuse to take the elevator.\n\nSo at the end of the day, I DO use ADHD as an excuse: \n\n* I use ADHD as an excuse to be kind to myself for not being able to handle all of the million tiny little things that everyone else seems to be able to do just fine. \n* I use ADHD as an excuse to stop myself from believing that I am a shitty human being and maybe don't deserve to be in the world with all of the people who are normal.\n* I use ADHD as an excuse to give myself permission to do the thing tomorrow because today was hard and it's okay to take a break when I need it.\n* I used ADHD as an excuse to tell myself that I am NOT a bad person, but I am a person with certain challenges that make seemingly small tasks harder than they should be, and that taking more time or even failing more often than others is normal FOR ME, and that I can try again when I am ready.\n* I use ADHD as an excuse to reconsider whether or not I have space in my life for people that think I use ADHD as an excuse.",

Now I discovered that I can set up an event on my calendar and add a gazillion of alerts for it (a day before, the day of the event in the morning, 3 hours before event 1 hour before event and 30 min before event). And each alert makes my whole screen a bright pink so I can't miss it. Plus the alert notification on my watch. I love it so much bc I know I will most likely forget after a few min or if I'm doing something else. So now, with my gazillion alerts multiple times a day, I can forget about it without remorse because I know I will get reminded of it later. Life saver tbh. \n\nWhat's even funnier is that I bought a small planner a week before I started actually using my phone calendar and liking how it works. Peak ADHD moment.",

I had another classmate (male) who was diagnosed and he got lots of useful supports, even going on to be professionally mentored by one of our professors.

They said that \"It's only a disorder, not a disability, too many sailors are medicated for it, if I need medication then that's grounds to be separated, etc.\"\n\nI know we joke about embracing the suck, but that might be the only time in my Navy career I actually considered throwing myself into the ocean.",

Autism does not have a look and just like ADHD doesn't have a look! I also was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16 as well! My now ex psychiatrist told me that ADHD was for kids. He even told me that after I told him that I was on ADHD medication and that it helped me but because it caused my arm to have a lot of pain I had to stop but he still insisted that it was for kids and that I didn't need to go on medications for it and that since I suffer from insomnia it might make it worse. The only thing that was worse was him saying those things and discrediting many people who have ADHD but yet he's still firmly believes I have autism so how does that work?

YES, I develop intricate systems of checks and balances and sticky notes on mirrors and dashes, ect to keep up with calendar events and reminders & have 8 alarms each day and feel overwhelmed by food planning for the week. \n\nHOWEVER: All of reality and the effects of it affect us the same as every other person, too. The gaslighting can be ridiculous. \n\n---- \n\nLong involved story, can skip, but to illustrate just how insanely extreme I've experienced this take form:\n\nI had a washer cause damage to my home WHILE I was going through a separation and trying to navigate my son's and my own safety while dealing with the delicate situation and effects & terrifying reality of the narcissist abuse by the same person. The water damage happened while I was pulling an all nigher completing my bi-annual continuing education for my insurance licensing in my 19th year of my successful career which I set aside in order to pull the laminate in the majority of my downstairs, rent drying equipment and proceeded to continue with my own mitigation, which was successful and the speed and thoroughness in which I acted prevented mold, which I had checked with follow up from 2 water restoration companies to measure moisture and confirm. I also managed to complete the education, and renew the license which had been complicated from the madness from the ex & the fact that I was nearly a single parent as far as time, just with someone acting like the Joker trying to ruin our lives toying from a distance, even though I had to explain an arrest which was because the manipulator called the cops after attacking me and was successful in their manipulation since they made the call and my bite to their wrist (to escape) left marks but what they described as a \"bear hug\" versus the choke hold it was (didn't leave marks).\n\nThey eventually signed off on not pushing charges only after being advised that they'd be admitting in court to assaulting me first... \"first\" I would call it since my action was defense. \n\nThey ended up checking out permanently after I instituted boundaries, leaving me to clean up their mess of chaos including not paying rent at the two places they lived after they left, plus closing their accounts and such and all the other things associated. \n\nThen navigating getting my kid into school ect while dealing with maintenance on my home while being without a washer as well for a really long time. \n\nPlus a bunch of other tedious administratively related things.  \n\nMy son and I are doing well, & when I've expressed frustration about \"catching up\" around the house to get things in an organized order again enough to suit our current needs, it has often been mentioned something about ADHD as if I didn't Superhero the fckn impossible through all that. \n\n\ud83d\ude11  \n\nIt feels a bit like having someone show up & look at your home after a tornado and blame your \"organization\" on the state of things, as if mother fckn nature didn't play any part. \n\nTHAT is annoying. \n\nThough I may have to work harder and experience frustration in areas and that certainly exists, it does not negate the whole of reality that ANY HUMAN BEING would be affected by. \n\nMy THERAPIST, who was hired as a divorce coach and was educated with the type of challenges that exist when dealing with the type of person my kid's other parent was and who was great at that, I suppose due to the relative togetherness and reliably I'd shown up to appointments with, said \"you might have ADHD\" & \"do you want me to make a list?\" at some point a few months following their passing.  \n\nMy list takes half a day to write out because it's legit 400 items long and dependent on other things that don't move quickly and nearly all can't be done at the same time. Yeh, I could use that but at the point I was, short of a cloning machine for a team of me that doesn't require sleep and approximately 20 other reality changing spontaneously available acts, things aren't going to suddenly be \"now let's address what organizational approaches might improve for daily life\". \n\nI forgot to mention my kid was also 4 at the time of the other's passing & I also had to empty their apartment which I coordinated with the building owner and aside from 2 hrs where I had help, emptied it into a UHaul and unloaded it into a back room to not alarm my kid until I could research and manage my child's understanding and greif, which I did all successfully. Down 2 flights of fire escape steps, no less. \n\nBut tell me more about how outside opinions are going to solve everything in a day. \n\nEnd rant.",

            "body": "I\u2019m 69 and struggle still . My mother would call me lazy as a teen, and older . I worked 2 jobs and tried college ( with test anxiety ) . I loved learning , but I ended up , with no planning , no goal setting , unmarried but with 2 kids . I ended up in retail hell , was underemployed,  always working , but frustrated because I was never promoted. I was very good at planning special events at work and had a large customer following because I\u2019m very outgoing and connected well with people . But my mngrs : I always felt judged by them , felt tense around them , because of my own shortcomings ( adhd) I felt shame . \nMy focus was my kids , and staying afloat. I only began treatment , trying non stimulant adhd meds in my 60s (!). If you\u2019re young , I\u2019ll tell you get the meds , add to that , learn to be kind to yourself and be forgiving to yourself . The shame will paralyze you . The meeting of the disorder, then the constant explaining to non adhd people why your house is cluttered, is exhausting, demoralizing and brings about that paralysis. I\u2019ve experienced it for years . To live with yourself and love your quirky self is the challenge and the most important piece of all of this . Sounds cliche ? I mean it on the deepest level . Whatever it takes to learn this , do it . I\u2019ve been in therapy for 3 years . Trying to look back at the difficulties of my life , most caused by this disorder. In the end , it\u2019s about nurturing your adhd self , forgiving yourself for mistakes made because of this adhd . Don\u2019t go hard on yourself, as the world will do that to you daily . And knowing you maybe need to bring in a housekeeper twice a month to help you keep an uncluttered environment. Do it . Instead of beating yourself up over your \u201cinadequacies\u201d \nlove to all adhd ers ( both my kids have it btw) carry on.",
