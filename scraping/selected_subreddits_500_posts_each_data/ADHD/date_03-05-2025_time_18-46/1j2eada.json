    "selftext": "I'm tired of being so 'high-functioning' (I cook meals and have a 9-5) that nobody has ever bothered to give me support. My parents didn't even tell me I had ADHD until I was 18 and they have never medicated me for it. My partner has so many staff members who come into the house to support her. Her mum pays the bills as she has power of attorney. In fact, she doesn't need to do any adulting at all. It's a perfect life for an adhder. Meanwhile, I work 9-5-5 at a call centre (working from home albeit) and cook the food when staff don't (weekends and a couple of weekdays). I have tried twice in my life to get community mental health support but am deemed too 'functional' to receive that. I get no help for my emotional dysregulation, working memory issues, rumination , procrastination, hyper focusing the list goes on. I guess the upside is that I can do most things on my own but the stress of being functional causes me to have so much hidden stress. I really try not to be bitter but I'm doing the lion's share in my relationship.",

But it's not a competition...your partner is lucky to have all of this support, and you should be happy for that, not resent her. After all, what would life be like if she was also struggling? Now, can you make a plan to make things easier for yourself? Would you be able to pay for private counselling? Maybe your partner's mom can help you find a solution? That doesn't necessarily mean money, but maybe help you find some help. Find the people around you who you can talk to and can discuss ideas with, let of some steam. Prioritizing your metal health is important.\n\nAnd it sounds like you've been doing an excellent job so far, well done, you! Pat yourself on the back every day you survived at work...because you know that not everyone is able to do this. And again, take deep breaths as often as you can. Prioritize sleep, healthy eating, go on walks, share your thoughts, feel what you need, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4d",

Look for therapy in your area, some offer zoom visits if you\u2019d prefer that. It also may be covered by insurance but that depends on where you live and how good your insurance is. If you can\u2019t afford therapy or want something different, try to find support groups in your area. There are a ton of people struggling with ADHD and I\u2019m sure you can find others in a similar situation that could give you advice and other resources. I assume you\u2019re in the uk and I found [this](https://adhduk.co.uk/support/) with a quick search\n\nHope this helps!",
