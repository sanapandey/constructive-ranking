    "selftext": "I have been experiencing fairly intense academic and emotional burnout. I'm taking an AP class, (AP Seminar) and I am so tired. This school year has been biting me in the ass. I can barely focus as is and I'm in all honors classes on top of it all. Any class I have that isn't honors or an AP is a college class. (Because of my high school program). I feel so stressed out and couldn't sit myself down to any homework today. I could barely focus and was on the verge of tears the entire time. My 504 which allows for extra time doesn't help much for an AP class when all of this needs to be done by a specific time or else college board won't accept it. My anxiety is constantly ramped up and I am so overwhelmed. How can I help lull myself out of this nightmare? ",

            "body": "I am sorry you're feeling these intense emotions. I'd say as emotions go up, rationality inversely drops.\n\nYou have to address your emotions as best as you can otherwise, you'd unable to carve an ideal plan to deal with this problem.\n\nEvery solvable problem has a solution, you just have to break it down to easy enough step to move forward. This involves planning. Emotions cloud your judgement to plan well, basically your first step is already compromised.\n\nWithout additional info, no one can give you a concrete advice, so my general advice is to manage your emotions however you can (prescribed medication, therapy, mindfulness meditation, etc), then start planning and breaking down your problems to small easy steps.\n\nSame goes to academic. Struggling or don't understand? Go back to foundation and understand that first. Not understanding is usually caused by not understanding the link between your last known understanding of a relevant concept to this current concept.\n\nLastly, people ask me what if their problems literally can't be solved. My response is then \"accept the fallout, why stress something not within your control?\"",
