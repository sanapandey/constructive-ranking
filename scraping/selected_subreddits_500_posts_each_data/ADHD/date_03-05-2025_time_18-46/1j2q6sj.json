    "selftext": "I know a lot of us with ADHD struggle when it comes to productivity and being motivated to do tasks including cleaning. We know we need to clean but we struggle to become motivated and remain productive. For the past few months, every time I go into my kitchen I'm a little grossed out that it's unclean and I keep thinking about when I'll have time to do it. \"Oh the weather is forecasted to be bad this weekend, I'll do it then\" or \"I'm on staycation next week, I'll do it then\" and it still never gets done.\n\nThis past weekend I finally figured out what motivates me to clean my kitchen and I wanted to share it with all of you: I saw a mouse run across my living room and behind my TV. I got into the fetal position so fast. After calming down, I deep-cleaned my living room and kitchen. My apartment has never looked and smelled so good. My landlord did some temporary pest control while they await a company to professionally treat my unit.\n\nWho knew I had it in me to clean my apartment?",
