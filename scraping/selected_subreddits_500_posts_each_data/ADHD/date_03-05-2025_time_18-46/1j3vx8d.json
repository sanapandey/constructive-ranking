My parents have refused because they are traditional and what not but I feel like it\u2019s giving me a hard time doing basic things so what\u2019s the likeliness of being diagnosed with it and getting treatment without the help of my parents when i\u2019m 18",

            "body": "I have recently been diagnosed and medicated. You don't need any physical evidence like what the other comment shared though of course it would help. I didn't.\n\nResearch more about ADHD and if you resonate and relate the symptoms that are reflected, ask yourself why you feel that way? Are there anecdotes you can articulate that justify you believing you have ADHD?\n\nGather these anecdotes and all your symptoms you've faced, present it all to your psychiatrist. It's your job to relay the information, it's the psychiatrist job to receive the information and make a conclusion, don't think too much about that part.\n\nPsychiatrist wants to help you and I'd be surprised if their initial reaction would be \"you're faking it to get study drugs\", so likelihood is very high when you do actually have ADHD. If not, so what? Explore further and let the psychiatrist do his/her job to fix your concerns.\n\nI am in my early 20s, diagnosed and medicated without parents knowing. I wish you all the best, my life has significantly improved, wishing you the same.",

I had report cards from elementary school where teachers would make comments like \u201cshe knows the material but struggles to stay on task\u201d\n\nI raided my parent\u2019s files and found all of my old report cards and progress reports. The entire story was told through my teachers eyes. \n\nAny testimony you can get from those that knew you when you were young and can corroborate your own experiences will also help. \n\nI wish you the best of luck; it\u2019s a difficult journey.",

My parents had me evaluated in my youth without my knowledge and elected to \u201cdiscipline\u201d me rather than medicate me: short hand for \u201cI\u2019ll beat it out of her\u201d. I didn\u2019t know until I raided their files. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have paperwork; reach out to your previous teachers. They may have the documentation your parents are hiding from you. They could also potentially be those witnesses of your past that can back up your claims. \n\nDo. NOT. Give. Up. Not now, not ever. You know yourself; you know what you need. You\u2019re worth the fight, don\u2019t you ever let anyone tell you otherwise \ud83d\udc95",
