    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been on ADHD meds for about a decade. I started with Ritalin \u2014 which used to give me a lot of side effects \u2014 and switched to Vyvanse recently. \n\nI feel like I'm completely dependent already. I have been increasing the dosage and it works for a while until it doesn't. \n\nMy work (IT) requires a lot of concentration and I get a good salary \u2014 incredibly good for my country \u2014 but I'm feeling like I only use my meds because of work. I struggle with chores too, but my main reason to take the medicine is work. \n\nI've been considering exploring alternative areas where concentration isn't required as much as it is in my current job. \n\nI am also considering taking a sabbatical to go off meds and maybe \u201creset\u201d my brain out of these drugs.\n\nHas anyone successfully adapted their careers to a more \u201cADHD-friendly\u201d area? Or is this just a utopia and I should just keep poisoning my brain and my body with these drugs forever?",

Time management was predetermined, and the ability to go to places I've never been was amazing.  The downsides of lack of quality food and a highly variable paycheck as well as being immediately affected by the economy - and I mean *immediately* - were enough to pull me away into something with a bit more structured environment.  I have been IT for several different types of companies/agencies at this point in my career and I have to say that management plays a huge role in how well their employees are taxed.\n\nLong explanation to say, maybe try somewhere else first?",
