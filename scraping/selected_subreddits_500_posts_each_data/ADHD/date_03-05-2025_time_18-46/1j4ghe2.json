    "selftext": "I just got my new dose of Concerta from 36 mg to 54 mg .and I took my first new dose on Monday. I went to my regular PCP today ,and she\u2019s concerned about my blood pressure and anxiety. However, I believe my blood pressure will stabilizes once my body gets adjusted to the new dose. Plus, I forget to eat in the morning, so I believe that it is more intense because of that. I don\u2019t have anxiety from the pills. I actually feel a bit energetic here and there. Is that a problem though? ",
