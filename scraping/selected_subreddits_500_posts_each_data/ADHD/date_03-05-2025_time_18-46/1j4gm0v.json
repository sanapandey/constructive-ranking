    "selftext": "Just got my rejection today. I finally had the motivation to get my shit together and get recommendations, write a personal statement, and actually *decide on a career path* after years of waffling. Got to the interview and was rejected after, so I guess something about me said I\u2019d be a bad school counselor \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Don\u2019t have a plan B except to keep trucking along at a job that is making me start to pull my hair out. It feels like a kick from the universe after managing to get so much organized and actually focus on one thing. Like, I did the hard part right? Aren\u2019t I supposed to get the reward now? Oh wait, that\u2019s only in movies\u2026",

People gotta make their calls, ya' know that doesn't change that you kicked butt and got the ball rolling.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm just now going back to school for social work at age 30, the fact that you finished a degree at all is still impressive to me.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe eat some soft foods for a bit till your gums are a bit less sore, but don't give up!\u00a0\n\n\nChoo choo buddy, little train that could. Nothing for it but to keep running up that hill. Nothing wrong with resting where you're at either.\u00a0\n\n\nHope your day gets better and this is a blessing in disguise somehow, lol\u00a0",

I have to believe it's because I just haven't put enough effort into building a portfolio outside of my work experience, because otherwise everything seems hopeless...",

If you like guiding and counseling what about going back to undergrad to take classes to get a bachelors in social work then pursue a therapist or youth counselor job?",
