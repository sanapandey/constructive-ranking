    "selftext": "I used to cry every time my dad would help me with my math homework. My face would get all red, and I would feel really stupid and just tune out completely. He would be walking through the problems, and I would just kind of mentally go limp. I would pretend I knew what he was saying to me, but the reality was that none of it was being comprehended at all. I have noticed this still happens with people/teachers that I am intimidated by.\n\nI've also noticed that when I take exams, I basically move my eyes across the words in each question, but there is no comprehension. It's almost like the room/context doesn't feel safe/big enough for me to be comprehending sentences. If I'm in a room by myself and I can play with the information, or talk out loud, I am way more functional. It's really frustrating.",
