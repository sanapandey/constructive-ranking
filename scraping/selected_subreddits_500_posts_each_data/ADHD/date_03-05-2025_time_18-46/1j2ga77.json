I was trying to describe ADHD to someone the other day and said that it\u2019s like I have multiple devices in my head, each playing a different radio channel or podcast, and I struggle to turn the volume up on the correct one for the moment and the volume down on the others. Sometimes I think that I\u2019m not actually \u201cinattentive\u201d, I\u2019m just paying attention to too many things at once!",
