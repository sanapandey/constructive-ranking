Plus I found it annoying when I\u2019d finally lock into a task and suddenly my body remembers it needs to pee. \n\nObviously it\u2019s bad for my body to drink little water.\n\nAnd so I finally got medicated but I end up becoming so locked into a task that I get annoyed having to get up and go pee because I drank a lot of water earlier and find myself accidentally withholding water from my system STILL.\n\nI still drink sporadically throughout the day, especially if I get a dry mouth- but I can\u2019t seem to get a consistent drink schedule down. It feels like I\u2019m either dehydrated constantly or I\u2019m needing to go use the restroom 3 times in an hour from chugging so much water. \n",

I also have pots, so I HAVE to stay hydrated.\u00a0\n\n\n1 - I tell myself the same thing I tell my kids when they complain-- \"Mom, I'm tired, I have a headache, I'm cranky, my stomach hurts,\" etc...\n\"Have you had any water?\"\u00a0\nIt does help me remember, if you try to take care of yourself like you would your kids, your spouse, your pets, etc. It's good to remind myself that taking care of ME is just as important as taking care of them.\n\n\n2 - find a water bottle you don't hate using, whether that's the shape, color, material, or even appearance. Straw bottles are everything for me, and glass or stainless steel over plastic. This sounds stupid, but if I have to unscrew the lid, I'm not going to use it.\u00a0\n\n\n3 - flavors! I have to get in electrolytes daily for the POTS, so I stock up on electrolyte powders. But when I'm not using those, I'll make iced herbal tea, or add syrup flavors to water. My current hyperfixation is green apple (which is unfortunately hard to find). I buy the large bottles of Torani syrups for my coffee and such, and always keep one fruit flavor for waters or tea. This time, raspberry.\u00a0\n\n\n4 - I've tried apps and such with reminders and honestly they annoyed me and made me want to ignore them more, so I turned them off. What worked better was getting in the habit of keeping water bottles everywhere I go. In the car, in my office, in my bedroom. If it's next to you at all times, you'll remember it more.\u00a0\n\n\nHope this helps!!",
