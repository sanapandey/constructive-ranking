    "selftext": "Anybody on Focalin ever tested negative for amphetamines on a drug screen? My doctor just called me and told me that I have tested negative since June and that is literally impossible. I take it every single day exactly as prescribed. I want to tell her to call me in for random drug screens but if it\u2019s not showing up, what\u2019s the point in that? My doctor said she is not going to cut me off but she will have to eventually if I keep showing up as negative. Idk. I just don\u2019t understand it. ",

If you can't come to a solution I would go looking for a new doctor because it's not your problem that the drug screen isn't detecting the focalin, yet they wanna make it your problem.",
