I\u2019ve been taking it every day cause It literally makes me function like a normal person that has their life together, but I remember my neurologist once said vyvanse is a drug you should take a vacation every now and then, and I literally need it to function correctly, without it I become this binge eating, irritable mess, vyvanse makes me regulate everything way more, Im scared to build tolerance if I take it every day tho",
