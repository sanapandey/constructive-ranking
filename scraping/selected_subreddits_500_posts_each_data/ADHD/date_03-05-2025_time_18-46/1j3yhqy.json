    "selftext": "Guys, I genuinely forgot my birthday and told the doctor the wrong date when they asked me to confirm my name and date of birth. I was going through my brain files and was looking for my birthday. I got it 5 days off. When I was originally retrieving my birthday data, no alarms sounded, no red flags appeared. It seemed legit to me. This is a doctor that I\u2019ve been going to for years, so when I said the wrong day, he turned around and was like, \u201cdon\u2019t you mean -/-/\u2014?\u201d And it wasn\u2019t until that very good moment that I realized I forgot my own birthday. Idk if this is an ADHD memory problem or something else, lmk if you guys have had similar experiences please.",

I\u2019ve not yet got the date wrong but a few times when asked to confirm my birth date I have to think about it then they think I\u2019m crazy for not immediately knowing the answer and then giving my answer in as a question so it sounds like \u201cthat was right, yeah?\u201d Haha. Don\u2019t be embarrassed, it happens!",
