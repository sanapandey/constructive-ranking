And then watching it all!\n\nI turn on Netflix and spend an hour flicking through every possible option, settling on nothing, maybe starting something only to turn it off after 5 minutes convinced I have made the wrong choice and start searching again only to get frustrated 30 minutes later, switch off the TV and just go to bed grumpy.\n\nI have watched so many interesting documentaries that my wife has chosen that I would never have chosen in a million years for a multitude of reasons, I.e. no educational value, no military content, totally random content,  title i thought sounded stupid, didn't like the thumbnail pic...\n\nIt used to cause lots of arguments when my wife would say 'you pick something this time' and I would just be like 'i don't want to watch anything ' and she would get grumpy. \n\nDiagnosis sheds light on a lit of things!",
