    "selftext": "I feel like my medication has lost its power! It\u2019s no longer helping me focus! And I\u2019m losing motivation to do my school work! I\u2019m a procrastinator so I try to take my medicine so I can knock out assignments early and be done for the week and so I did that today but for some reason I don\u2019t have the motivation to do my work and I just want to lay down and be lazy all day! or buy stuff that I don\u2019t even need nor have the money for! \ud83d\ude29 luckily the assignments aren\u2019t due until tomorrow but that\u2019s the thing I wanna get them done now! So I don\u2019t have to worry about them later on! and I take my medicine early in the morning cause they\u2019re long lasting so there\u2019s no taking another. I hate this! ",

Maybe breaking the work into super tiny steps or setting a timer for just five minutes could help get the ball rolling? (Or at least trick your brain into starting.)\n\n\nIf this whole struggle sounds familiar, this video really nails what it\u2019s like when ADHD meds don\u2019t completely solve the motivation battle: youtube[dot]com/watch?v=bQ_wDpISzGY.
