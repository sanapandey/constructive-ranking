Mentally bearing it. 3.Thinking about what could go wrong. 4. To do the task. Act. It's hard. 5.Always thinking about the outcome acting acc to it. Good - happy instead of doing it. Bad - sad instead of facing it. 6. Comparing present with One scenario that can be past or wanted it to be - if it's not happening like that, will worry. 7. Opposite person point of view - I act to build a image.. 8.Worrying about the outcomes. 9.Dialemm, To do or not to do. 10.I am unable to do it mentality.\n\nReally helpful, if someone points out what these symptoms are",

I used to be so shy I wouldn't talk to anybody at all and if I did then I would stutter. I worked on it over the years. I'm an introvert so I still don't talk to people much but I absolutely can if I choose to. Just work in it, you'll get better.",

Maybe search for those if you want to know more?\n\nHowever the symptom is for how much it happens. Everyone overthinks sometimes. And symptoms can be shared/overlap for multiple diagnosises",
