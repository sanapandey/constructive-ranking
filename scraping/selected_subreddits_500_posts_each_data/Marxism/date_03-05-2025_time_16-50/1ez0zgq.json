Between the 2 party structural barriers of the US and the Dems capture of the reformist working class institutions of the US, it seemed that while the Dems were not the number one enemy of the diverse working class here, they were the number one barrier for working class political independence.  \n  \nBut the Republican Party has only one point of unity right now: Donald Trump. They have so many splits that he is holding together; protectionist and free trade; imperialist and isolationist; libertarian and social conservative; even some strasserite elements that don't mix well with the overall pro-corporate program of the 'party'.  \n  \nWhat will the Republican Party be after Trump? Will they split into pieces? Will the conservative wing of the Democrats then make good on their long term plan of courting the moderate neoliberals out of the Republican Party to finally complete the Democrats abandonment of pretensions to working people? Or merely if the Republican self destruct into internal feuding and the US temporarily becomes a near one party state, will there finally be space for a working class political party to arise? Could we actually arrive at a body politic where the political consensus isn't around probusiness policies with competition on social issues into a political consensus on social issues and political competition on class issues?  \n  \nCertainly, I don't think working class political expression will be possible without an uptick in working class struggle. But with the rise of strikes and organizing and calls to action like ending all our contracts on May Day this seems possible.  \n  \nJust some bullshit I would say if we were drinking or getting stoned together.",

I don\u2019t think it should be relied upon, the democrats are ultimately quite strong despite how talentless and craven they are. \n\nThere\u2019s something like 40% of America that doesn\u2019t vote. There\u2019s a lot of real space for a working class party. The left in America is hopelessly tied up in the democrats - see the DSA (liberals). If they don\u2019t break with them then they will never get anywhere. For decades left wing struggles have even funneled into the democrats by \u201cleft wing\u201d moderates. This means the prevailing left wing tendency is absurdly moralistic lesser evilism against the republicans in favour of the democrats despite the Dems being part of the problem. This is a complete dead end and is why there\u2019s never been a significant left wing socialist movement in America since the original communist party days (that and all the red scare McCarthyism). \n\nBasically you need a combative revolutionary party that is oppositional to the democrats and willing to do the hard work slowly building. There\u2019s a few small projects around but it\u2019s hard to tell who is promising from someone outside the US. \n\nA revolutionary party to collect and cohere the vanguard is not something that just springs out of spontaneity, it requires politics.",

They fit the bill of exactly the kind of party you're describing which is needed.\n\nYour point about 40% of Americans not voting is a good one too. The problem with the mainstream American left is they fetishise parliamentarism and American \"democracy\" far too much. You hear self-described socialists openly calling for the defense of the constitution. They have completely lost sight of the fact it is a *bourgeois constitution*.\n\nSometimes I wish Lenin was alive today just to see what he would write about such \"socialists\". When he was being critical he was fucking brutal.\n\nThe question needs to be asked with relation to the USA: *what democracy?*\n\nIt is one of the least democratic bourgeois liberal \"democracies\" out there. It is a naked dictatorship of the banks and big business.\n\nFor marxists, participation in bourgeois parliaments should be used as a stage for our ideas and should be treated as just one of many other ways to reach the masses. Blindly supporting it under all circumstances is not socialist or marxist.\n\nWhat the American \"left\" needs to realise is the fact that when 40% of the population don't even bother voting, even in the face of reactionaries like Trump, there is a golden opportunity for organising and building a revolutionary vanguard.\n\nThose 40% have zero illusions in so-called democracy in the United States, and they are 100% correct not to have such illusions.\n\nThe task of marxists isn't to try and convince that 40% to vote Democrat, it is to say to them \"You are right to have zero trust in the system\" and use that as a spring board to win them over to a revolutionary alternative.\n\nEdit: I completely agree with your post except for your opening sentence ;-) I think it is not unlikely the Democrats will one day be destroyed as a party. If there is a mass working class party that the workers rally to, the Democrats will disappear like water on a hot stove. Dialectics teaches us that things eventually turn into their opposites. The Democrats are the oldest surviving political party in the world. Nothing lasts forever, though. As marxists we shouldn't forget that. \"Pasokification\" could very well happen to the Democrats under the right circumstances, circumstances which I don't think are entirely ruled out within the next decade.",

Those reformist institutions of the working class are where what limited fight back the working class is conducting is occurring. The Democratic Party limits the struggle that those institutions take - not just in how they participate electorally, but how they conduct their struggle (whether it is unions or other mass organizations of the oppressed). \n\n>A revolutionary party to collect and cohere the vanguard is not something that just springs out of spontaneity, it requires politics.\n\nAs Marx said, \"\u201cMen make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\"\n\nWorking class politics don't exist without a working class movement. How does one recruit to revolutionary socialism, where the working class takes power, if there is no working class movement? You are recruiting for an idea that has no material basis in reality; you are recruiting to a religion, requiring people have faith that the working class can take power when the class does not even recognize itself.  Marxists are supposed to be materialists, not idealists.\n\nIn non-revolutionary times, revolutionary parties will only recruit small numbers and remain in limited capacity, unable to accomplish much and remain in isolation. The history of revolutionary parties demonstrates that.\n\n>There\u2019s something like 40% of America that doesn\u2019t vote.\n\nThey are disaffected because there is no political movement that seems relevant to them. And no amount of preaching to them from the outside will change that. There has to be a material reality of something that they can see before they believe in it.\n\nAs Marx said, we don't get to choose our historical circumstances, and our actions need to be informed by those circumstances. Revolutionaries should by all means, still join together with other revolutionaries. But our organizing focus should be in rebuilding the working class movement. Only when a working class movement begins acting in its own name do socialist ideas have the possibility of material reality.\n\nLenin wrote:  \n='Politics begin where the masses are, not where there are thousands, but where there are millions, that is where serious politics begin.'\n\nYou call DSA liberals but I think the actual correct programmatic actions today are to join with the revolutionary currents that are active within DSA (there are multiple). That's still short of Lenin's \"millions\", but it is where a new generation of socialist activists are being created, where real work in organizing unions and other working class activism is happening. There is a critical mass of enough social force that actions can be taken and politics can be put into practice instead of merely propagandized from the sidelines. Revolutionaries should be inside that process and influencing it instead of loudly shouting what no one will hear.",

Be my guest if you do. The question is how do we contribute to those millions reaching revolutionary ideas. My thinking is that engaging more people into struggle that they are ready to commit to is a better way to spend our limited time on this planet to better contribute to the march for socialism. DSA has the critical mass to contribute to union organizing on a national scale, to engage in ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage or increase tenants rights. These campaigns are reformist but they are getting people to engage in class struggle as workers. Those are ideas you can take to a bus stop and actually get strangers to join. They don't even need to question capitalism yet to do so. They just need to see their interests together as workers.\n\nThe people in DSA even if they still vote for Democrats (many do not, or do so only in limited circumstances) are already critical of the Democrats. Even AOC said that in any normal country she wouldn't be in the same party as Joe Biden, even as she supports him, Pelosi, etc. I stand by what I said that I believe the Democrats are the biggest barrier to a working class party in the US at present. People like AOC would probably be on the right wing of a mass working class party if one could exist. At present, there is too low a level of class struggle and the institutions that a mass working class party requires (mass institutions like unions, organizations of the oppressed, etc) are captured by the Dems. The question is under what circumstances would a mass working class party be possible?",

According to the Victims of Communism Foundation, not exactly a Marxist think-tank, support and interest in revolutionary ideas is growing amongst young people in US. IIRC, I think they found something like 25-30% of young people in the USA think communism is preferable to capitalism.\n\nEven \"socialism\" is becoming discredited amongst the youth and they're jumping straight to communism. Why? Because their experience with socialism was the betrayals of Sanders and the impotence of the likes of AOC and the Squad. Socialism for some has been completely discredited and rightly so, so they're turning to more revolutionary ideas. \n\nThat's why when the RCA launched the \"Are you a communist? Then get organised!\" campaign they experienced their biggest growth in membership in years.\n\nThere are indeed millions of people out there crying for and wanting revolutionary change. The problem is that they are not organised. The RCA is striving to organise them.\n\nI don't say it'll be easy, or quick, but there are genuinely millions out there who consider themselves communists, but they're inactive and unorganised. The task of the revolutionary party is to reach these people and organise them. On campus, in the workplace, in the unions, everywhere.\n\nWe are living through a revolutionary epoch in history.\n\nCountries in the west, including the USA, are not immune.\n\nEvents like the war in Gaza can act as catalysts and change consciousness very quickly.\n\nEven the BLM movement was a sign of things to come. At its height it is estimated 10% of the entire US population were out on the streets. A police precinct somewhere in the Midwest, I forget where, was burnt down, and a *majority* of Americans thought that that was justified, according to a poll. This is not normal. This is blatantly a sign of revolutionary undercurrents bubbling away in society. \"The mole of revolution\" as Marx called it.\n\nI genuinely believe we will see if not a revolution, at least a mass revolutionary movement of insurrectionary proportions take place in the USA in our lifetime.\n\nUS capitalism is in senile decay and decline. It is a ticking timb bomb waiting to explode and when it does it'll be one of the largest, if not the largest, moments of class struggle in US history.\n\nThe third American revolution is coming and it is coming in our lifetime.\n\nMarxists need to prepare for that, not support imperialists like Harris and the entire Democratic machine.",

The Dems along with the GOP are wings of the same bird, both spiraling us towards human decay. Your pointing out of the Republican Party's vast contradictions are spot on and I think that is a result of them choosing to appeal to overtly fascist principles: racism, sexism, etc., but that is not contradictory of their ultimate goal, which is capitalist hegemony. Because of that fact, there will always be a strong Republican party for the foreseeable future. Regarding your question on whether or not the Dems will abandon the working class, they can't. Fascists will appeal to and sometimes adopt some causes of the working class in order to maintain power. The republicans do this too. Nazi Germany also did this. This also allows the parties to further blur the lines of the obvious contradictions of capitalism and mislead the people into believing that their struggles will be solved through capitalist interests, thus further perpetuating and maintaining low class consciousness. The US is already a one party state with the illusion of choice. I guess from the sentiment of your post, we're both wondering what is possible and what's next and to be frank I'm not sure. Class consciousness and labor organizing is at an all time low. I really don't see any significant labor movements happening any time soon. Sooner or later the destruction the US causes abroad will blow up in our faces very badly in the form of world war, I think, and as external forces are fighting US imperialism, that will be the time for the US working class to rise. At least that is the most realistic event in my opinion, especially considering that socialist revolution in Russia and China happened in similar fashion, from the disruption of major war. WWI and WWII cemented the US as the imperialist power of the world. I believe, or maybe it's just hope, that the next catastrophic event will have the opposite result. It is very dependent on our domestic level of class consciousness though, unless external forces impose new law.",

It is a basic - a very very basic - principle of Marxism and socialism.\n\nSectarianism only applies to working class parties. It is completely unapplicable to liberal and bourgeois parties.\n\nThroughout the 19th century the UK had two bourgeois parties, similar to the USA today: the Whigs and Tories. The progressive bourgeoisie and the old aristocratic bourgeoisie. But neither were parties for the interests of the British working class. They strived to build their own party, which they did eventually when they founded the Labour Party.\n\nBy your logic, those 19th century British workers were acting in a sectarian fashion and should have instead always voted for the \"lesser evil\" Whigs.
