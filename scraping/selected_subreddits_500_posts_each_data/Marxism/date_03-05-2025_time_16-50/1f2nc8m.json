    "selftext": "So if I were explaining in a nutshell the concept of a system run by the proletariat to someone with an eighth-grade education, would it go something like this?\n\n\u201cIn a capitalist society, in which we live, there are capitalists who own business. They employ workers who produce things of value for them. There are costs associated with producing things, such as paying the workers and other costs of production, such as rent, materials, utilities etc. The capitalist makes money by selling things at a higher market rate than the cost to produce, which is profit for the capitalist. The capitalist takes and pockets the difference between the cost of production and what it\u2019s sold for. The capitalist maximizes his profits by paying his workers for as little as he can get away with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is like a pyramid scheme where the capitalist extracts profit by keeping production costs, including labor, as low as possible, letting workers earn money on their behalf. The capitalist also utilizes their capital to influence government bodies, such as obtaining tax breaks, skirting regulations and negotiating lower rent prices, in order to maximize their profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn communist system, the major difference is the workers have united and removed the capitalist (here I would \u201cx\u201d out the stick figure at the top of the pyramid) from his position. Now, the workers divide up ownership of the means of production, or the business, amongst themselves. They all equally share in the value their work produces.\u201d\n\nThis is probably too simplistic and misses some critical points. What would you add? Remember, this is a situation where I would be explaining things to blue-collar workers who may not have advanced educations, nor have the wherewithal to understand the density and complexity of Marx\u2019s old-timey prose. It has to be convincing, too.",

Did he make the machines? No he paid someone to do it. Did he design the goods? No he paid someone to do the design. Is he transporting the goods or bringing them? No he is paying someone else to transport.\nAll he does is giving money to people so that they can make him more money, if you were given the same machine, building and supplies, could you manage without him ?\n\nThere is the same argument with landlords but this one Can really trigger people who havent thought about the implications",

Here\u2019s mine, in case it\u2019s helpful.\n\nRich people have all the money and power because society was created by rich people to make sure rich people get to make tons of money and stay in power. Just about everything in society helps rich people: government, courts, lawyers, police, military, markets, finance, banks, everything. And it\u2019s no coincidence these things hurt almost everyone else. Capitalism is designed to maximize wealth and power for the rich by any means necessary.\n\nSocialism is designed to maximize wealth and power for everyone, as much as possible, but not by any means necessary. Socialism is designed to end exploitation of people and the planet. This isn\u2019t a guarantee, though- it takes work. But one thing that\u2019s absolutely certain: we can\u2019t possibly do it under a system designed just for rich people. We need to design a new system for everyone. It\u2019s important to understand that socialism is not an end goal - it will be a continuous process of learning and improving how society works to make sure it\u2019s sustainable and genuinely provides people with the means to live a secure, healthy life.",

For example, maybe the person is vegan, or trans, or a feminist, or hates paying lots of tax money for the military.\u00a0\n\n\nUnder proletarian democracy (I am assuming soviet style), these things can become actionable goals because the bourgeois classes are no longer political impediments.",
