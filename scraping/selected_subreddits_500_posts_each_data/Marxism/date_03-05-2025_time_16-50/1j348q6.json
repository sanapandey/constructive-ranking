WTF? Granted I wasn't going to talk about that but the idea of that level of gatekeeping against other socialists I found very disappointing. Are they afraid they might learn something?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

                    "body": "Yeah, when it comes to the acerbic culture of leftist discussion and disputes, especially on the internet, all I can really say is that one should stick to the issue and not argue ad hominum. It is certainly understandable that debates get heated, and that those involved get upset and even outraged about the other's positions, and that each side tries to point out what scandalous arguments the other side is presenting. No big deal there, and it's not too difficult to distinguish between a justifiable controversy which, again, can get very heated, and the interest in simply defaming others in order to glorify one's own imagined theoretical superiority. And if someone can't make the distinction, it is usually because they take their theoretical positions to be so much a matter of personal honor that they TAKE any polemic against their theoretical positions as an attack on their person. Otherwise, attacks that are intended to be truly personal should just be ignored, or better: they should be taken as an indicator of a substantive disagreement that either needs to be brought up again or simply recognized as a disagreement that can't be overcome. But as so many leftists do (not saying you do), it is ridiculous to accuse other leftists of not keeping to the party line - as if there was one! By merely criticizing somebody for deviating from \"official\" leftist positions, one hasn't actually said what is wrong with their positions. That indeed is authoritarian and should be rejected.\n\nBut it's another thing entirely to demand of the left that they present to the world a united front. Firstly, that is merely a demand that the leftists who are fighting with each other not take their own explanations of the world, the enemy, etc. seriously, but as a kind of non-binding opinion that one can agree to or not. And that is not only an unreasonable demand, but one that is in fact impossible to fulfill. That is why, in my experience at least - and of many others, I'm sure - such a call for unity is usually nothing but a way of demanding that others get behind THEIR definition of what unites \"us,\" and that they merely regard their understanding of the world as a kind of dissenting opinion from a majority opinion that they are nevertheless assumed to share. But what, then, is the substance of the unity that leftists demand the left keep in mind in their fights amongst themselves? In the end, it consists of nothing but a certain ethos, a kind of leftist disposition and bias: We are the friends of the masses against the big capitalists and the suppressive authority of the state. But really, who DOESN'T share that ethos? \nMy own position on the matter is not that the left should or should not fight, and certainly not that they should SHOW unity, but that the left needs to agree on what IS the right explanation of the phenomena that drive them to become leftist in the first place: poverty, war, etc. And to do that, there simply is no other path than that of dispute. There is no way of getting around it. \n\nAnd incidentally, how is such a unity supposed to help? Will the arguments of the left seem more convincing to the masses because those on the left can get along with each other despite the fact that they don't even agree on what it is they are fighting against? Democrats will make an analogy to the ruling parties (Republicans, etc.)-- saying \"they have unity\" is a false one, because these parties really do have a common goal, which is simply not true of \"the left.\" I am not for justice, I'm not for making sure that the capitalists pay their fair share; I'm neither for freedom (free trade, government permission), nor democracy, so how can I accept, almost self-evidently as the democratic socialists  imply one should, that democratic principles need to be shown more respect among the left in their discussions with one another? If anything, that demand shows what democratic principles are there for: to garner the consent of those who disagree on the premise that they are free to express their views as utterly non-binding opinions.",

Here in Mexico we had a quite complicated situation during the 40s-50s where the argument of unity at all costs was widely used and that was only significant in subordinating the unions and the workers movement in general to the interests of the government (PRI). \n\nToday the supporters of the new \"left\" government (MORENA) use this argument again of uniting against the right but basically their argument translates into closing ranks without questioning any of their actions (even if these are totally identical to those of the right). In my organization we have debated and had very heated confrontations in unions and other organizations where these social democrats organizations try to impose their position and agenda pro government.",

Whether or not that is true is irrelevant, but even if it is true, it's a ridiculous reason to sell out the union. (And if it is true, shame on those particular workers of New York City who failed to support railroad strikers.)Many soc dems and demsocs see her as the main figure in US socialism and want her to run for president.  This would be terrible because it presents a false picture of what socialism actually is, and many social democrats here have a very positive of the same \"left\" government in Mexico that you face problems with as you have described.  In our continent, in addition to the fascists and the liberals, we have to deal with the image of a pretend left that makes it that much harder to resist capitalism.",

Here in Mexico, many organizations that were previously extremely combative fell, momentarily, into the lies and farces of SD because they really had a very good speech about being different and wanting to help the people, but sooner rather than later the truth began to come to light and it was shown that it was more than it seemed.

All those people had their own politics. However, what made my generation effective in winning Civil Rights & Women's Rights and ending the Vietnam war was unity in solidarity when called upon to gather as a major force. No other strategy was needed nor sub-issues voiced. Once political power is established, it is time to bring su-issuesvto the forefront for consideration by the majority. Putting the cart before the horse is reverse thinking. Democrats need to focus on recruiting/gathering all Democrats to keep the momentum going. Continuous public protests will prompt people to join as well as serve as a reminder to vote in the Congressional mid-term elections on November 3, 2026, to elect Democratic Representatives to outnumber House Republicans as the majority. Democrats will then have the power to strike down bills and, more importantly, impeach tRump. Make it happen! Mire power to you!",

In fact, most revolutionary socialists of the time were against demsocs. The demsocs of Germany (SPD) with Friedrich Ebert are those that co-operated with the Nazis, to prevent a communist revolution. So....yeah. Definitely not Marxism, or even communism.\n\nDemsoc has nothing to do with libertarian communism (the spanish revolution for example), that is communism without bolshevikism (leninism), which I guess is what you're getting at?\n\nI'm sorry but you seem very confused about basic stuff.\n\nBolshevikism (leninism) followed Marx, same with libertarian communist elements (spanish revolution).\n\nDemsocs have nothing to do with Marx, since they are not revolutionary, went against Marx's critique of capital, and reconciled with capitalism.\n\nDemsocs in the 19th & 20th century were also very authoritarian by today's standards, so even that point stands wrong.\n\nYou're confusing libertarian communism (which is anti-authoritarian communism), with democratic socialism, a strand of politics that was authoritarian (now it isn't as much), anti-marxist, and managed to support capitalism at every turn.",
