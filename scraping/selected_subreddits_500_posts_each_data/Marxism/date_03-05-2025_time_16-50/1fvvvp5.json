But the most important reason I believe is that companies find it an easy way to **LET WORKERS GO** who they deem to have accrued too many long-term \"benefits\" and \"high\" wages etc. But is there any Marxist articles on this that show it to be the case? Or are there any other significant reasons? Any feedback is much appreciated!",

So these businesses often times the big banks lobby local and federal governments to enforce return to office mandates. Also the government are incentivized further because a lot of pension funds have a lot of commercial real estate in their portfolios. \n\nThen on top of this with the state of the economy a lot of companies want to fire people without giving them severance so if they enforce 5 days a week like Amazon did recently they know people will voluntarily leave.",

But all the commercial real estate just sitting there empty is a problem so everyone needs to come back to the office, a move that makes workers more likely to organize.",

            "body": "Not all workplace policies have a clear economic cause, this is a misreading of Marxism which could be summarised as economism. The basic Marxist contention is that the superstructure - politics, ideologies, religions, culture, media, etc. - are shaped by the mode of production, and that therefore the ruling ideology is is the ideology of the ruling class within this mode of production. This doesn't mean that every policy, even within the context of a capitalist enterprise, has a direct cause-and-effect relation to economic dynamics as such. There is still much room for ideology, sometimes even at the expense of raw profit, and I suspect this policy is an example of that.\n\nThe wfh arrangement can actually save capitalists money, this is the case for my employer - they've reduced the size of their office space, sold off computers, ceased supply tea, coffee and toilet power. While I think the right to wfh is a genuine gain for the most part we shouldn't close our eyes to the fact that it has also transferred a lot of costs onto employees - internet, power, tea, coffee, tp, computers, office chairs, etc. - the price of autonomy is that we now have to take responsibility for a lot of the costs which our employers previously bore. The arguments from the bourgeoisie seem to be mostly ideological and I suspect that the reduction in costs isn't as important as their need to control employees as much as possible, even to the point of absurd inefficiency.\n\nThe government here in Aotearoa/NZ has called for all public sector workers to begin working from the office again, the nominal explanation being that inner city businesses are suffering from the decline in foot traffic. This is of course completely true, although they seem to forget that this decline in the Wellington service sector has been onging for some time, has reasons independent of wfh culture, and that this is really just an example of market forces at work since people are now spending their money at local businesses for food, coffee and other things. It's a populist policy which is part of their general attack on 'lazy' public servants, unfortunately many people including workers eat this bullshit up.\n\nAs for those businesses ending WFH rights I have less insight, although I'm guessing their reasoning is similarly ideological rather than profit driven. There's no evidence that WFH practices have impacted productivity, if anything the opposite is true. And this cuts a bit more to the heart of things - the capitalists are slaves of capital, but they're also arrogant bosses who take their right to control workers for-granted, and feel aggrieved when those expectations are challenged. So I think this is more about rolling back working class autonomy more than having an economic cause, its about ensuring capitalists have complete authority, and all other explanations are hot wind.",

In order to keep making profits, they have to order you do do something that has no direct bearing on the job you do or what you produce for them.  You did not have to show up at an office to earn the company the profits but, because of externalities that have nothing to do with your job, you have to comply.  \n\nIt's not just your labor they exploit. \n\nBut, more to the point, many of these CEOs are control freaks and they enjoy flexing their might over the workers.

So managers may well side with the bosses during something like a strike movement but this doesn't make them bourgeois themselves unless they control significant shares within their own company. That said some managers might side with labour, insofar as that is possible, they are salaried workers at the end of the day.
