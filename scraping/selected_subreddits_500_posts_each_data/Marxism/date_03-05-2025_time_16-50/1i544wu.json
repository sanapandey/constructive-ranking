    "selftext": "It is a popular saying among scholars that Franz Fanon (The Wretched of the Earth, Black Skin White Masks) stretches Marxism with his critique of the alienation of people of color in colonized countries, especially with discussions of colonial subjectivity being different than for example the relationship of the lumpenproletariat in Europe compared to the national bourgeoisie in the colonies as not having contributed to the advances that solidifies their status in society. I wonder what your thoughts are.  P.S. Here's a fun intro to Fanon in a digestible context from me: [https://youtu.be/KpRGOAXSMj8?si=9txtCndM13DD5f1C](https://youtu.be/KpRGOAXSMj8?si=9txtCndM13DD5f1C)",
