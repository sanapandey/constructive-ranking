Defending the working class means challenging the oppression they face. Oppression is a tool of capital used to facilitate the exploitation of the working class. Building class consciousness can come from fighting oppression. Some of the greatest moments of class consciousness in my country come from opposing the racist colonial capitalist regime and showing solidarity with the oppressed indigenous peoples. \n\nYou can\u2019t win a revolution without addressing these issues. They\u2019re some of the greatest barriers to class consciousness but also, you can\u2019t address these issues without fighting them along class lines.

Intersectional theory as such is obviously liberal, coming as it does from critical legal studies (a necessarily liberal field).\u00a0So yes.\u00a0On the other hand, it draws very heavily from Black Marxist feminists like Angela Davis, the Combahee River Collective, etc. And I think maybe it's a retreat from radicalism in a certain way, but it also could be read as radical ideas being embraced in a super watered down fashion by liberals, a tradition that has an obviously very long history.\u00a0\n\n\nWhere I really take issue is your claim to a utopian history of Marxism. While there have always been a handful of Marxists thinking about the intersections of class and race/gender/etc, it was by no means at any point in history the dominant thread of Marxism. The history of Marxist thought--like so many intellectual histories--is heavily riddled with class reductionism, racism, misogyny, etc. etc. etc. To deny that history is in fact antithetical to the spirit of Marxism itself. Lenin posits \"self-criticism and ruthless exposure of [our] own shortcomings\" as central to the revolutionary project, even when our opponents try to use that discourse against us. Ignoring these problematic histories within Marxism alienates those most harmed by capitalism, and that's not a goal any of us should be pursuing.",

A liberal theory really has nothing to add to our tradition. I disagree with your \u201cutopian\u201d criticism. I hardly suggest that these ideas magically disappeared or should not be contested within the movement, quite the contrary. Examples from the experience of Russia show massive changes throughout the revolution in the proletariat however - class consciousness leads to these ideas being challenged and eradicated from the class conscious proletariat quite actively. Intersectionality again has nothing to add to Marxism as Marxism already understands analytically and in practice addresses these issues better. Intersectionality has no monopoly on analysing or fighting racism, sexism and other forms of oppression. \n\nMany in this line and including the Combahee river collective ultimately did prove themselves to have a fundamental weakness, an orientation away from class politics and Marxism. Angela Davis became much more moderate/liberal over time. The combahee river collective always had a flawed analytical understanding that led to poor conclusions on strategy and class collaboration. \n\n\u201cMarxists\u201d who fail to address oppression are not Marxists, they\u2019re typically just social democrats or \u201cMarxist Leninists\u201d masquerading as Marxists.

I'm not, mind you, saying that Marx or early Marxists were particular bad on the question of race and gender--of course, they were always on the balance much, much more thoughtful on the subject than liberal contemporaries. However, as so many Marxist thinkers--Cedric Robinson, Maria Lugones, Silvia Federici, etc.--Marxism without an attention to race/gender/etc cannot provide a sufficiently explanatory model for oppression. Whether racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia, etc are merely a symptom of capitalism or whether they are, qua Lugones, interlocking systems of oppression (and to my mind believing anything else is silly, magical thinking), racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia/etc are naturalized in the world such that critiques of capitalism alone can't exhaust them and the elimination of capitalism won't erase them. \n\nAnd frankly, the only people that believe otherwise are white men, because basically all women and PoC who've organized in Marxist spaces have first-hand experience disproving everything you've written.  Unfortunately, I've experienced a not insignificant amount of sexism and homophobia in Marxist spaces, and in my experience, class reductionism has always functioned as an excuse not to discuss it. \n\nThis is insidious and anti-Marxism in the end. Class reductionism is very obviously delusional and so obviously in the service of preserving racial and gender hierarchies. Continuing to tout that pushes out of the movement the individuals most harmed by capitalism.",

Cuba, which began educating homophobia out of the population in the 1980s, and East Germany, which began doing so at the same time.

They became essentially theoretically fucked by russia distorting itself and the comintern using its weight to ensure its lines were followed no matter how right wing. \n\nI disagree that they must be fought separately to the fight against capitalism. They come from the oppression necessitated and reinforced by capitalism and capitalism's social relations. They wont disappear when capitalism is destroyed but their material basis will and thus the ideas of people will change as well, within a few generations I think they'll be eliminated entirely. Marxists must strive to understand and fight bigoted oppression as its one of the greatest forms of oppression used against the working class and is essential to challenge when you rely on solidarity politics.

While yes, the Bolshevik revolution did decriminalize homosexuality, they never did the social work of actually destigmatizing gay people (That is work that takes decades they didn't have), and they never legalized gay marriage.  In 1929, A particular conference of the people's commiserate called for that to be done but it was never actually implemented.  Followed by recriminalization in 1933.\n\nYour second paragraph really only proves my point.  Is it properly Marxist to oppress gay people?  No. Of course it isn't.  That doesn't stop anyone from pretending otherwise and expel gay people from communist parties until the turn of the new century.  Once the bigotry is in place, people will bend over backwards to justify it using whatever theoretical gymnastics are at their disposal.  History has proven that.  You have to deconstruct homophobia inside your revolutionary organizations before you seize power.  Otherwise you're going to end up with Stalin happening again potentially.  In addition to that, you have to do so outside your revolutionary organizations prior to the revolution itself, in order to keep your future comrades alive.  Solidarity is a bi-directional thing.  It's very difficult to ideologically convert oppressed minorities when you don't show solidarity with them when they need you.  \n\nI see armed communists protecting drag queen story time from Nazis sometimes, but not nearly enough.  I'm the only communist in my city who showed up to yell at the school board when they started banning books about gay penguins, and mandating the forced outing of trans kids; and it wasn't for a lack of trying to get people together to go with me.  The tepid non-response I got when I tried to organize literally anything to help kids in my particular minority community spoke volumes.  \n\nThat's the very real reality of my existence.

We lead the Palestine campaign in my country,  lead anti racism campaign in solidarity with indigenous people and migrants, both of which have won Palestinian, Arab, indigenous, black, brown people as well as white people to our org and Marxism\u2019s politics. We run the anti sexism campaigns for abortion rights. You\u2019re essentializing people from oppressed backgrounds. Again, intersectionality has no monopoly on analysing and interpreting race, gender, sex oppression. Marxism and the dialectic and historical materialist method is vastly superior as a theory in analysing oppression theoretically and practically providing a blueprint for challenging it. Intersectionality is a middle class liberal  academic theory that fails to grasp the true nature of oppression due to its idealism and fails to suggest a strategy to fight it. It really shows because everyone who tries to champion it talks about it in a middle class liberal academic way, completely divorced from the actual movements. \n\nIntersectionality champions experience as the core way of understanding oppression - basically if you have experiences of oppression, you are platformed distinct of political argument. \nBecause it centres experience over theoretical, political analysis it can stifle actual politics or relate to the debates in active struggle in an unconstructive way - supplanting debates on strategy questions on how to progress a movement, with deference to those with authority to speak based on experience. \nIn practice this can mean it\u2019s actually quite elitist, it promotes specific individuals as political agents and not to democratic political arguments made to masses of people to then come to a decision on their oppression. \nIt\u2019s also reductive - it assumes everyone has similar conclusions from their experiences of oppression which we can tell is easily incorrect - you can have left wing, radical or moderate or right wing conclusions from an experience of oppression. \nIn practice right wing forces use these ideas all the time. Our equivalent of the Palestinian authority here uses right wing intersectionality to basically bully, intimidate and gaslight Muslim women from being involved in the movement and is basically a right wing influence on the mgoement itself. \n\nIt\u2019s idealist in that it does not deal with material relations. I don\u2019t mean a mechanistic understanding but the actual social relations: where do the social relations come from? It doesn\u2019t explain how to actually challenge oppression as it fundamentally views oppression as stemming just from ideas - intersectionality\u2019s solution is about changing ideas of people (educating the masses or having enlightened individuals rule). Its structural analysis is insufficient because of this as it doesn\u2019t really understand where the ideas themselves come from and how they are structurally reinforced - ex; it can analyse that sexism can stem from men, men\u2019s dominance over politics or even recognise the oppressive nature of the family but doesn\u2019t understand why men may take up these ideas that women are subordinate to them nor why the family exists or how and why the political and economic system reinforces sexism. \nIt sort of views these ideas as sort of floating in peoples brains or in the aether divorced from capitalism and not constantly reinforced by material social relations - under capitalism women\u2019s oppression through the gendered division of labour -undervalued and unpaid domestic labour, child raising, etc.\nFrom this standpoint it largely engages in intellectual debates - because the right ideas are the key, if they just get the right ideas then they will win. \n\nMarxism actually historicises where oppression comes from and analyses the material relations through looking at social relations; relations of production. What do we mean by historicises - we look at how something developed and from where but also how it exists now as a dynamic thing that can\u2019t be separated out from history. \nAnalysing the cause in terms of production and the social structures around it - labour or economic activity is a core thing that dominates people\u2019s lives and shapes how they interact. In particular class, which is basically how we describe people\u2019s social relations to their role in production. \nThis is part of why Marxism does not come from an idealist standpoint but has a material, structural analysis. \n\nMarxism looks at how it exists now - the core antagonisms or contradiction of the oppression (which is basically understanding oppression as a two way street - the oppression and its cause, and the resistance to the oppression). \nThe resolution of these contradictions is how we understand struggle. \n\nMarxism is an activist discipline. This means that it is not just engaged in intellectual debate for the sake of just understanding something but to also challenge it - the implications of strategy cannot be separated with Marxist analysis. That\u2019s the implications of class struggle and the politics of solidarity. \n\nWhy is the politics of solidarity superior? \nIt basically doesn\u2019t isolate and atomise people based on specific experiences of oppression - where only those who experience a specific type of oppression can lead. \nInstead it sees a commonality between types of oppression - that people can experience different oppressions and want to challenge their own oppression as well as others. It sees oppression as a rallying point for the oppressed - it sees that different oppressions are interlinked as stemming from an oppressive system of capitalism. As the oppression has a shared underlying cause of class oppression, sees fighting together against all oppression as actually the best way to fight it. \nPlenty of off the cuff evidence of such things - workers fighting against imperialism for example is not just due to having a moral outrage but understanding of their class basis of oppression - shared struggle of workers there and no interest in imperialism, the deaths of other workers. \n\nMarxism needs nothing from intersectionality because it understands oppression in a more cohesive way including how oppression actually can be fought. Intersectionality has no monopoly on analysing and attempting to understand how specific oppression exists and how it can interrelate with other forms of oppression. It\u2019s ridiculous to assert you need intersectionality to do this actually, it\u2019s not like people just gave up on the questions of race, gender and sexual oppression before the 1980s when intersectionality manifested into existence. Every communist party had material on these questions. Where material erred was due to a failure in applying Marxism or abandoning it altogether. The experience of Russia was of the first transgender healthcare, actual equality for women in all areas in a way that still today no other country has come close to since, the practicing of minority cultural and religious practices enshrined in law, an end to imperialist domination, legalising gay sexual relations and marriage. Free and easy access to abortion without stigma. An end to the super-exploitive sex work industry including specific centres dedicate to helping sex workers. An end to the racial persecution of Jewish people by the reactionary black hundreds. Most modern countries today cannot even remotely tout the same level of equality and freedoms of revolutionary russia. These things are actual liberation and proof of our method.",

It inadvertently shifts focus away from the shared oppression of the class as a whole to the more individualised oppression of smaller and smaller groups, eroding solidarity as a by-product.\n\nSo instead of an exploited class composed of LGBT+, black, white, asian, brown, male, female, etc.; you have those peoples self-segregating into individual activist groups, each opining about the unique ways the system oppresses them. Which, of course, offends the other groups because their issues are obviously treated secondarily, tertiarily and so on, by every other group because the primary purpose of each group is their own group.\n\nThis isn't to say there aren't unique issues to these groups, but many of said issues do actually tie back into class, and appealing to the bourgeoisie will not be what solves them. Nor is it to say that these groups are necessarily wrong for struggling for more.\n\nMy answer to your original question would then be a \"no\" as a general statement, but also a \"maybe in a roundabout way\" as recognizing that one is oppressed/exploited is a potential step towards class consciousness. The issue I see is simply that intersectionality is too narrow.\n\nThis was way longer than I wanted it to be.",

Collective action need not be collective thought; which suggests to me that, per the references to black radical feminism (amongst others) it may be more beneficial to think about class consciousness as something to be developed, something 'to come' so to speak, rather than taking its historical occurrence (with Marx proper) as the essence.\n\nCheers,",

Once they have achieved this consciousness, collective action might become a reality. I'm saying that it is hard to think of themselves as a proletariat when they have to worry about religious, racial, gendered persecution.

Like so much liberal thought, traditional intersectionality inverts the relation of individual and collective: it naturalizes categories of identity as *arising from the self.* The world becomes a second-order thing created by these natural, God-given, pre-made selves who compete on the basis of these identities. This notion is, of course, an instrumental absurdity. \n\nWhat\u2019s missing is the concept of interpellation, the collective ideological production and management of identities through modes of address. The social and economic systems that give rise to families and babies in the first place will begin forming the gender and race and sexuality of a person even before they are born (\u201cIs it a boy or a girl? Do you have a name picked out?\u201d). Every single social experience will reinforce or alter or upend these categories. Capitalist ideology entrenches these categories as fundamental beliefs via vast apparatus of ideological seduction and instruction, but ultimately it\u2019s enforced at the point of a gun. Not for nothing is the ur-image of interpellation a police officer shouting \u2018hey you!\u2019 on the street. \n\nTo a Marxist, what else is an individual but the point at which several collective modes of address cross one another? What else but a node at the intersection of interpellation?",

Although more than gaining rights, it would be a matter of eliminating the stigmas associated with these minorities through awareness.\n\nThe media, which are generally tools of the system, sometimes choose to support some of these minorities; this does not make the struggle reformist... The right to unionize, for example, was also achieved this way, through proletarian struggle; today it is a tool that allows us to combat the system, and unions are normalized throughout society, including sectors of the bourgeoisie such as the media, whereas in the past it was seen as something illicit.\n\nIn any case, from my point of view, the intersectional struggle or the struggle for minorities should not be understood as a first step to be taken before the class struggle; for me, it should be a struggle applied simultaneously with the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat and the defeat of capitalism and its bourgeoisie.\n\nIn conclusion and in response to your question, I do think that intersectionality can be a catalyst for class consciousness.\n\nPS: Sorry if my comment contains errors.

I speak of how what is pursued becomes acceptable to the establishment, and the necessity of seeking to break with capitalism in favor of the poor or the working class, which is grounded in the new material, social, reproductive, cultural, etc., conditions of the society resulting from the clash between classes.
