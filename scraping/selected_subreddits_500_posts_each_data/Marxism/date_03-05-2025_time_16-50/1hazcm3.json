    "selftext": "What is an anti-imperialist view of the Arab Spring? I am sure that people had real grievances against their governments, but did any of the protests result in actual progressive improvements? And what was the US role in all of this? Was there a strategy to foment dissatisfaction among people or did they just take advantage of an organic protest movement? Would appreciate any suggested reading + discussion.\nthanks\n",

            "body": "The Arab Spring was caused by a combination of dire economic conditions(particularly high food prices), and decades of suffering under authoritarian governments that were not responsive or responsible to their people. This provoked a mass wave of protest, some of which led to peaceful transfers of power and some of which led to violent civil wars(depending on how willing the dictators were to step down). In the end, many of the new governmentsvwere co-opted by establishment forces, particularly the armies of the nations in the case of Egypt, and much of the good was undone.\n\nIt's too easy to blame all setbacks of esthetically socialistic regimes on conspiracist explanations of the enigmatic bugaboo of \"imperialism\". \"Imperialism\" is just becoming another mysterious \"They\" behind all suffering, the left wing version of Alex Jones's \"globalists\" or Lyndon Larouche's \"vandals\".  History is not driven by conspiracies among the leaders of the great powers; history is driven by class struggle and material conditions.",

He was hung in December 2006.\n\nThere is a lot of material covering this as imperialism from the Usual Suspects, say the US and England, as well as other globally powerful nations.\n\nGaddafi, doing many things that can be said to be strongly anti-imperialist, saw the Iraq war and death sentence of Hussein as examples of western imperialism.\n\nIn Sept 2009, Gaddafi addressed the UN - he had never addresssed them before this. He provided this view that the UN was supposed to be some big collaboraitve organization, giving power to smaller nations, but overall UN was just a vehicle for western imperlialism\n\nGaddafi, an economist who had education in what you could say is Marxism, was trying to figure out a \"third way,\" I guess between capitalism, appreciated for this value in producing wealth (we cannot do any of these many things we claim are \"rights\" such as giving everyone free health care,  champagne for breakfast and so on, without wealth, and we have to acknowledge that major limits of socialism and communism is that as soon as you require laborers to labor for the wealth they create to be taken away and diverted elsewhere deflates the self-interest for cethat makes capitalism wildly productive of wealth), and communism, with \"democratic\" principles.\n\nGaddafi was going to form a gold-backed currentcy to be independent of the nations he had seen as imperialist.\n\nGaddafi coincidentally ends up getting overthrown 2 years later, 2011, in the Libya Arab Spring.\n\nWas this an organic uprising, or just the imperialist west doing what they do - using local conflicts as a front to achieve their goals? This view says that yes there was anti-imperialist sentiment and motivation, but that this motivation was used by imperialists doing what they do.\n\nYou decide.",

Most often, people simply want to remove the current statesmen because they see them as the problem, not the system itself. It's also true that these movements are often exploited by other groups for their own agendas.\n\nI dislike the term 'Arab Spring'\u2014there was no spring. The ruling parties are playing chess, and the people are merely pawns. What the masses typically want are immediate demands to be fulfilled. Revolution, however, requires conscious involvement to dismantle the system, not just the government. This critical element is missing.\n\nAn alternative could be conscious leadership that knows how to channel public anger effectively to achieve systemic change. Historically, this has been the role of Marxist-Leninist groups, but these groups have largely failed to gain the support of the masses in recent times.",

He wrote this new book after covering many similar mass protest movements that came after during and after the arab spring.\n\nI was in the Occupy protests in Spain and can say I agree completely with his take.
