    "selftext": "This November, a left-wing coalition stands a real chance at winning a Governors\u2019 race and several local elections within U.S. territory, yet very few people on the U.S. socialist left seem to be talking about it. It\u2019s time we change that!\n\nIn the last decade, a series of scandals, disasters, and protests have put Puerto Rico in the national spotlight. These included the U.S.\u2019 disastrous handling of Hurricane Maria, the successful \u201cRicky Renuncia\u201d protests, and the privatization of the Puerto Rican electric grid. In 2020, this resulted in the left-wing Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) and the Citizens\u2019 Victory Movement (MVC) combining for an historic 27% of the vote in the gubernatorial race while the two major neoliberal parties scored historic lows. This year, the MVC and PIP have teamed up to form \u201cLa Alianza,\u201d an anti-colonial, anti-neoliberal coalition contesting the Puerto Rico elections.\n\nJoin Reform & Revolution, a revolutionary Marxist caucus in DSA, and Democracia Socialista, a socialist organization in the MVC, or a forum on the upcoming elections! Our panelists are Rosa Segu\u00ed and Cristina P\u00e8rez, two socialists running with the MVC for Senate!\n\nRegister here: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJctdOigrz8oGtPlQT2BlMgQ0H1TY77rHt5H#/registration",
