However, his work does not create surplus value, but is a deduction from the surplus value produced by productive labor.\n\nYou are also confusing service work with circulation agents. A janitor does produce value, but a cashier or a salesman does not. A teacher is an agent of (state sponsored) reproduction of labour which is a whole nother business. If you're talking about service work in general (e.g. the production of immaterial goods) the only difference to the production of e.g. industrial work is that that there is no time gap between production and consumption, but they coincide directly (P is not mediated by M')\n  \nMichael Heinrichs introduction covers this, if you're interested in reading more about it.",

                            "body": "Unfortunately, the term \"unproductive\" is morally charged, which is why I think there are often misunderstandings. First of all, it is only a question of who is involved in the production of a good (i.e. in the sphere of production). From the perspective of the product that is to be sold, the sellers who sell this product are in the sphere of circulation and are therefore not involved in production; they are circulation costs, not production costs (a purely economic distinction!).  \n   \nThe efficient management of selling (from a cashier, salesman etc.) can however reduce circulation time of said product and raise *indirectly* the amount of surplus-value produced, Marx covers this in Volume II. Doesn't change the fact that the distinction between production and circulation stand.\n\nWhether the labour is \"necessary\" plays no role at all. All areas of social reproduction are necessary, but are often organised by the state (i.e. the product is 'consumed', thus creates value but no surplus-value) and thus to a certain extent withdrawn from the free market. The same with healtcare, social benefits etc., necessary things for upholding a functioning state/society (and therefore the market) but perceived as a costly obstacle for the capitalist",

Consumption is production.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundrisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundrisse)\n\nDialectical nature of production. With out consumption no value is created. If some one build house, but no one live there - no value was created, nothing was produced. Production, realization of Value happen in act of consumption.\n\nSo, everything that facilitate consumption - transport, distribution is a productive activity.\n\nNow, Is everything we do in production or service is productive activity? Meaning, is it necessary for dialectical act of production to happen? Is that a socially necessary labor? That is absolutely different question. Is market distribution necessary and so activities that facilitate it? Like money counting, advertising, et? One may argue that this is unproductive labor, as it purpose is maximization of profit, Not a production.",

IN 90% of cases, it is unproductive job, it is socially unnecessary. Almost Everyone can fill there own car, time spend does not change. Job exist solely for maximization of profit. Gas station hope that why your car filled, you spend time buying there overpriced junk. That what pay for attendant job and increase profit.\n\nBut time from time an old lady who barely can move come. Same job become socially necessary, she can not fill her car. So, in this case Attendant create value.\n\nThat does not change, Capitalism, Socialism. What change, is that we can organize production rationally and remove jobs that not needed.\n\nTo add, in many cases, service is a commodity produced. For example, you getting massage. Massage created right there, simultaneously with consumption. The fact that it is not separated by time and space does not change anything.",

Many socialists do too which is why they deem servers as unproductive labor. That sort of thinking mystifies that servers are absolutely both preforming productive labor and a socially necessary job right now, today, in reality. That\u2019s why I replied by  pointing out that just because in their imagined socialist future service jobs aren\u2019t necessary doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t right now. It\u2019s idealist thinking that applies a label onto service workers role in social relationships in a world that doesn\u2019t exist, they can imagine that under socialism they can serve themselves while ignoring that under capitalism you can\u2019t serve yourself, that needs to be pointed out cause it happens all the time and is constantly used to divide the working class and to crap out bad theory that turns a large chunk of the working class into something other than working class.",
