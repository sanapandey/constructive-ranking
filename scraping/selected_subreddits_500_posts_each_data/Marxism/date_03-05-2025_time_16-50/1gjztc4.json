    "selftext": "Don't judge me for this if it was a bad idea. I subscribed to the new \"Red America\" journal of the American Communist Party and it was very insightful, it made me feel seen and heard, and made me feel optimistic about class unity and all. Then, I saw Jackson Hinkle (an actual anti-semitic, anti-trans, pro-Trump right-wing grifter who is so obviously using the situation in Palestine to gain followers and other nefarious purposes) be mentioned as being a **founder** of the American Communist Party... And that left me with a horrible taste in my mouth as I read on. Here's the excerpt from it with the context:\n\n*\"... While we could never embrace MAGA\r\npolitics, we refuse to condemn and turn our backs on MAGA\u2019s base, millions of\r\nAmericans who thrive for economic equality and justice. \nGeneral Secretary of the American Communist Party Haz Al-Din explains he and anti-imperialist social media influencer Jackson Hinkle\u2019s creative success in outsmarting algorithms and reaching everyday workers who identify as MAGA: \u201cWe have a saying, as MAGA communists, which is that when you go to McDonald\u2019s, you don\u2019t go for the clown, you go for the burger. Trump is the mascot of the movement.\u201d Their approach, which reached tens of millions, mostly through Hinkle\u2019s twitter account which has 2.8 million followers, was designed to be offensive to liberals and their woke world views so as to win over MAGA loyalists who were stuck in the cultural war but reject the liberal elites. Tongue in cheek and flippant, the duo even chided that mouthpieces of the woke left should be \u201cdeported.\u201d Where else can we \u201cdeplorables\u201d turn, if the woke left thinks they are better than us? Both founders of the ACP, they pushed back against the spectrum of liberal leftists who they felt were playing right into the hands of the Scapegoater and Demagogue in Chief.\"*\n\nThey make the case for liberals being the \"fox\" and Trump being the \"wolf\", and I understand all that. But Hinkle being affiliated with this makes me nauseous and doesn't sit right with me at all. I remember hearing about Hinkle being in a picture with someone from an intelligence agency and it just makes me feel like he was planted to use the Left's language to try to appeal to us for MAGA's gain. He is a \"MAGA Communist\" after all, which doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Needless to say, I'm very skeptical of the ACP now and I need someone to make it make sense.\nWhat does one TRUE well-intentioned Marxist-Leninist make of this?\n\n",

            "body": "I agree with you completely. The ACP exists as a way to capture people as they first begin to look to the left. It's classic divide and conquer shit, just like was done in Cointelpro in the 60s and 70s. Hinkle himself has ties to feds (the \"ACP\" website domain was \"sold\" to him by a former (I believe) CIA asset). There's a bunch of more shady shit. But also, just the constant self aggrandizement and di*k sucking is so off-putting. It's all just chauvinism with very, very few actual socialist (let alone communist) positions. They exist to sew division, so it's best to just ignore them and simply encourage others to do the same. I live by a simple rule to not lose my mind daily: \"I don't argue with people Lenin would have shot.\"",

This includes my own club, which did experience an obnoxious attempt at infiltration as two new members joined and stayed fairly silent up until a week or so before the convention, which would be the focal point of their departure, who essentially spent a week or so trying to privately influence each individual club member to split off from the collective, and the day after the convention had a loud and disruptive (and extremely shallow) argument about party democracy. \n\nThey tried for a couple of weeks afterward to press their flimsy case, despite being quite openly and embarrassingly disgraced by their own actions, and I am guessing they eventually grew tired of screaming at a wall or maybe it was all part of the plan but they let themselves out without too much delay.\n\nThe ACP \u201cfounding,\u201d which was really a social media campaign, came not long after all this and it got literally zero attention inside the party. We got a post-mortem some months later after all the evidence was compiled and the concerted effort was demonstrated to have been a factional attempt at infiltration, and we shared some chuckles about what a couple of sad weirdos those two comrades turned out to be. Party clubs have continued to grow in the months since.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, yes, Jackson hinkle, Haz, Carlos Garrido, John Hackman, Noah Kravchuk, and Eddie Liger are the main public faces of this grift.",

But the point stands - any 'communist' group that doesn't mention working class struggle in their program isn't worth the name. Sort of like how Xi Jinping recently openly repudiated class struggle in a speech. Marxism is just an aesthetic for many people these days. The political bankruptcy of \"Maga communism\" and all other terminally online trends goes far deeper than their affiliation with figures like Hinkle. \n\nI would finish those works by Lenin. But don't forget about What is To Be Done. It addressed a tendency among marxists that is still alive and well today - economism.  In other words the idea that if marxists cheerlead trade unionism, then workers will naturally become socialist. The reality is that class consciousness won't naturally grow out of Trade Union struggles, and it's a useful book for understanding that. \n\nFor Marx I recommend starting with something like Communist Manifesto, Wage Labour & Capital before diving into Capital, which is extremely long. \n\nFor something more contemporary check out Kim Moody - On New Terrain, Jaime Merchant - Endgame, Michael Roberts - Next Recession Blog, or David Harvey - Neoliberalism.",

That seems like the type of argument based on a false equivalence the state department uses to justify American hegemony. Even at face value it doesn't seem hypocritical to praise a country for the good they're doing now bc of the bad they **might** do in the future. \n\n  \n*That said* I'm open to hearing an argument that the goodwill China has earned on the global stage from acting differently than the US is an elaborate scheme to overthrow US hegemony and replace it with a Chinese Empire, but I'm going to need a little more to go on than addressing western attempts at a color revolution (like the Tiananmen Square or Hong Kong protests) or freeing the slaves in Tibet.\n\n  \nP.S.

We're clearly in disagreement and I don't want to waste your time, but I do want to recommend that you do some research (from non-western, first hand sources preferably) about some of the amazing accomplishments that China has achieved domestically (elevating their citizens quality of life and investing in renewable energy) or the diplomatic work (building infrastructure and forgiving debt for developing nations) they seem committed to. It probably won't change your mind, but you might understand why people outside the imperial core view China as a net good for the world and articulate more nuanced criticisms of the Chinese government (which I have a few).",

However, there is no denying that someone who portrays themselves as one of us could be doing it for nefarious purposes. Jackson Hinkle portrays himself as a supporter of Palestine, for example, and that's great! But for him to turn around and hint at actual anti-semitic (not simply anti-Zionist) sentiment, he's putting a huge stain on the movement and its people who aren't against our Jewish brothers and sisters. It's the same idea with his spin on Marxist ideology.",

But based on my own observations, I think grifter appears fitting.\n\n> It is correct that communists need to make common cause with the members of the MAGA base; they\u2019re a substantial portion of the working class\n\nAbsolutely yes. But there\u2019s a crucial question of what that means strategically if theres to be any hope of success.\n\nOne thing I am sure of. It isn\u2019t going to happen by appropriating the arguments, hang ups and aesthetics created by (and continuing to serve) the big bourgeoisie\u2014 for purposes of whipping up righteous anger and channeling alienated, politically disengaged workers toward the narrow, insulated, and chauvinistic kind of entitlement that underpins right wing ideology in general\u2014 it just estranges us from reality and distorts our view of class struggle. \n\nWhat we actually can and must do is hold our ground on patient, principled struggle for the legitimate and urgent concerns of all workers, that means all races and nationalities, all genders and sexualities, all political traditions (so that our class is exposed to the true expression of working class power), to defend concerns the right only raises demagogically to fill their ranks against whichever designated \u201cother\u201d. Otherwise a zig-zagging, opportunistic war path is how all fascists movements have come to power, before eventually betraying and destroying any and all holding out proletarian commitments and sympathies. We have to expect the threat will always grow as a response to organized resistance, and also that it can succeed if solidarity breaks down along X or Y non-class dividing line.",

Though he lacks any strong ideological framework and mainly trusts his friends and comrades to fill that in for him like Eddie Liger and Haz Al din. But the thing about the ACP and Jackson is that they are proactive. Many leftists like to speak but they need to put their words into action. \nI cannot say much about his grifting and I don\u2019t care to speculate. But I am ideologically opposed to the ACP since they view China as a socialist country, that view is diametrically opposed to my worldview. Beyond that I wish them the best they are a progressive force for the time being but sooner or later there needs to be a genuine Maoist party that serves as the basis for all proletarian struggle in the United States",
