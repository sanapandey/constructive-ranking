Randomly, today I was watching a video about the Live Aid in which I learned about the Ethiopian Revolution and it's marxist leader. It's not so different from what happened in many african countries during that period.\n\nBut I was shocked to see that he was even condemned to death in his country for committing genocide.\n\nSo, since we know the measure is different when it comes to left leaders, how many of it it's true? Was that leader a real criminal or is another case of liberals trying to demonise a popular leader?",

His rule was far from positive, and his actions against the Somalis in Ogaden and the Eritreans in Eritrea were brutally repressive. Some African Marxist organizations even described Mengistu as a fascist rather than a Marxist.\nThe current government of Ethiopia is not commendable either.",

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Mengistu because he adopted really opportunist policies in the late 80s. From briefly calling himself a Marxist, he quickly degenerated into a pro-market reformist. Besides this, Mengistu took a bad approach to the Eritrean national question, which encourages Eritrean separatism.",
