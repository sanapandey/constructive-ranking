    "selftext": "Hi comrades,\n\nBack in November, 3 students from Queen's University Belfast were assualted by police arrested during a peaceful protest against their university's complicity in the Zionist genocide and the presense of Hilary Clinton on campus.\n\nThey have been wrongly charged with resisting arrest and assaulting officers and are currently going through a lengthy legal battle. At worst, they could face a six month prison sentence for peaceful protest on their own university campus.\n\nThere is currently a letter writing campaign to the Public Prosecutions Service to try to get the charges dropped. We are concerned not only for the welfare of these activists, but also for the chilling effect on protests that these prosecutions will have if successful. If you are able to write a letter to the PPS protesting the criminalisation of these demonstrations full information can be found at the link below.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsjdlrM6MJ/?igsh=ZXV1emRiMmhncjAy](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsjdlrM6MJ/?igsh=ZXV1emRiMmhncjAy)",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Marxism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
