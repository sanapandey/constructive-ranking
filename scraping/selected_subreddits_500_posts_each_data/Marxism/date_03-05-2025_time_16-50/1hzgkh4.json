    "selftext": "\nHello everyone. I am a new poster here. I don't know what I would classify myself as at least as far as being a leftist goes. All I know is I am anti-capitalist and *extremely* anti-  authoritarian. I am doing more research into anarchy and council communism but so far I'm just trying to take my time.\n\nAnyways for the main point I recently got very very lucky and was able to secure a worker's visa in France. I must say I do like things here a lot better than the United States. The food and the culture and the history and a culture of protests. I won't incriminate myself but I was a bit of a rascal back in Uncle Sam's backwards country. I won't go any farther than that. In France I feel as though I can fully push myself to the edge of my persona and beyond as I don't have to save face with Americans back home who could not stomach any kind of protests. As if corporations truly had feelings. At least in so far as I have spoken with.\n\nOne thing I do miss was being able to have a gun. Not because I desire for guns, for truthfully I'd rather live in a world where such a thing would no longer be seen as necessary as they would be the last taps on the links of chains that thunder away in the distance, a memory of a bygone era. A violent era. Rather I miss them because of what they represented to me. The will to stand up and the will to fight back. Even though I hate the murders and violence and abuse that these pieces have bought about I cannot deny my admiration for them. The great equalizer. \n\nAs an individual with a visa I cannot necessarily just go into a store and buy an ar-15 in France like it was a fire sale on croissans and baguettes. I hope this comes as no surprise. I left my guns behind in a safe place. I remember them even now. Cold hard steel with some having wood and others plastic. A Ruger Mark IV. An m1911. A Ruger gp100. A Mossberg 590 retrograde shotgun. A marlin 45-70 lever action rifle. But I instead tried to immigrate, and here I am with none of them.\n\nImmigration is as natural to us human beings as breathing. Ever since we left our cradle in Africa we have been to every continent on planet earth. We also immigrated for different reasons too. But something that always got to me was the individual such as myself. Someone who could run away or stay and fight. I figured to myself that there is only so much running away one can do before eventually one backs themselves into a corner. \n\nMaybe the United States will collapse. Shit maybe it collapses as I sit here across the pond. But I get angry seeing all of the injustice back there. The homelessness. The poverty. Those who aged out of orphanages. The healthcare system. The prison system. The cops. And so much more. I get so angry seeing all of it, and I just don't understand how anyone can look and see such desolations and stomach them.\n\nAbominations and mutations and deviations. That's all we're gonna find if we look inside of these beautiful whitewashed tombs filled with dead men's bones. Yet this is home for me. For many of us of American origin. Maybe I am crazy considering moving back. I hate the country. Its greed. It's thirst for malice and for cruelty and its attempts to dominate and control all life. But that hatred won't go away just leaving the country. After all if the United States sneezes the rest of the world catches a damn cold practically. And of course who's to say that other countries won't follow suit? Knock one down and another one like a cockroach springs up from under the floorboards.\n\nAnyways I'm sure I haven't made sense with my weird rant-filled musings. In a way i would not mind dying back in the new world. I have Mexican ancestry in me, being the child of Mexican parents who thought bringing me to the colonizers up north would be better (it wasn't) and by extension indigenous ancestry in me. I feel it would be such a waste to at least not resist and fight back against the nation and frankly history itself that has genocided and raped and taken the land and culture and languages and way of life of all of those in the new world. They still do too.\n",

That I as a member of the most class conscious part of the working class I have a duty to stand and fight. the fact is if I don't stand and fight then I am abanding all those that don't have the option too flee. Including all the oppressed people's. I would tell the indigenous peoples I truly don't give a shit about what my ancestors did because I just ran away when things got difficult. That I don't care about my black comrades because instead of using the privileges I possess as a white person to help them in there fight I would us it to save myself.",

Ear to the ground in the community, aware of the more fascist elements, i at least have some modicum of pull within my community and can maybe steer things a different direction in some small way. Teaching is also one of my best skills so, i am sort of needed now more than ever.",
