The negative fallout from that move includes the failure of the Comintern to initiate and directly guide revolution in Germany, the hindrances caused by Comintern advisors in China, and the inability of the new states formed in Eastern Europe to develop as socialist societies, largely due to their reliance on the Soviet army for their foundation and existence. **Avakian dismisses these critical lessons of history; however, they demonstrate that while revolution cannot be exported, it can and must be supported in all possible ways. Examples of such international support include the participation of the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War (despite errors in policy) and the direct role of revolutionary China in the Korean War.**\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any deeper reflections on this. Would prefer books and articles :)",

There were numerous differences \n\nREAD:   \n> \"... Several differences appeared during the preparatory meetings. The first was about whether it would be necessary to call at some specific moment for the formation of political workers' councils on the model of the soviets. Zinoviev said that the Russian Party should call, before the insurrection, for such councils to be elected, because they alone could form the basic elements for the new German workers' state. 42 Trotsky and Brandler, however, successfully argued that the factory councils would play the role of the soviets before the insurrection. Later on, Trotsky was to justify this decision: 'In view of the fact that the factory committees had already become in action the rallying centres of the revolutionary masses, soviets would only have been a parallel form of organisation, without any real content, during the preparatory stage.' 43 Moreover, the majority agreed with him that forming soviets ran the risk of distracting the attention of the activists from the material tasks of preparing the insurrection, and they would become targets for a government which wanted to provoke the workers into a premature clash. The majority also agreed with him that 'the entire preparatory work for the insurrection' could be 'carried out successfully under the authority of the factory and shop committees', and that soviets would not have to be built until later, immediately after the insurrection, as part of its consolidation. 44\n\n> However, whilst they agreed on the question of soviets, Trotsky and Brandler disagreed on the issue of fixing the date of the insurrection. The German Left, Zinoviev and Trotsky all insisted that a date be fixed, and the Political Bureau of the Russian Party first settled the question to this effect. But Brandler objected, and Radek supported him. 45  (pp.763-764)   \n> Chapter Thirty-Nine, Preparing the Insurection, pp. 756-778 in [The German Revolution 1917-1923 - Pierre Brou\u00e9 (READ FOR FREE).](https://archive.org/details/BroueTheGermanRevolution19171923/page/n783/mode/2up?view=theater)\n\n\n\n**Why did the KPD miss the revolution?**  \n**=**\n\n**>**The easy answer to this question is to blame everything on Brandler. This was the reaction of Zinoviev and Stalin, who turned Brandler into a scapegoat. Simultaneously they accused the KPD (German Communist Party) of having provided wrong information on the situation in Germany that exaggerated the revolutionary potential of the situation. In this way, they challenged the entire assessment upon which the plan for a revolutionary insurrection had been based.\n\n>Less than three weeks after the insurrection had been called off, they began to reinterpret the events in Germany. They did so to cover their own role and for factional reasons, as the struggle with the Left Opposition had now fully erupted. On October 15 the first major document of the Left Opposition, the\u00a0*Statement of the 46*, was published. At the end of November, Trotsky issued\u00a0*The New Course*.\n\n>Trotsky rejected the easy approach taken by Zinoviev and Stalin. He did not agree with Brandler's decision to call off the insurrection. But he did not see it as an isolated event. After all, Karl Radek, who was present in Chemnitz as a representative of the Communist International, as well as the German\u00a0*Zentrale*, the central party leadership, had agreed with Brandler\u2019s decision.\n\n>Brandler\u2019s insistence that the revolution would fail\u2014and that the Communists would be isolated if they started an insurrection without the support of left Social Democrats\u2014was in line with previous mistakes for which not only Brandler was responsible, but the Comintern as well. Both the Comintern led by Zinoviev and the leadership of the German Communist Party (its majority and its left wing alike) for a long time had displayed a passive, typically \u201ccentrist\u201d attitude to the events evolving in Germany. Despite the fact that the social and political situation had changed dramatically after the French occupation of the Ruhr in January, they continued to work with political methods developed at an earlier stage, when revolution was not on the immediate agenda.\n\n> ...
