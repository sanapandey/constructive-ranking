Any recommendations for what to start with/if any specific sections of das kapital are best to start with since the ~1100 pages are pretty intimidating to me? I have some experience with analytical/non-fiction stuff reading 10-20 page passages from Derrida, Foucault and Fanon and reading Man's Search for Meaning for English class if that matters at all.\n\nThanks!

The manifesto is more of a polemic than a theoretical document; it's not really valuable for understanding Marxist theory per se.\n\nCapital is an extremely dense book that is hard to understand without having a handle on the basic concepts. Read it after you feel like you have a comfortable understanding of the more basic texts.",

            "body": "Wage Labour and Capital by Marx teaches of the inherent conflict between people in a competitive system among other things.\n\nValue, Price, and Profit goes into some critical analysis of capitalist economics in a digestible way.\n\nCritique of the Gotha Program and the Civil War In France talk about what aspects communism would need to have in order to succeed and why the Paris Commune failed.\n\nEngels' Socialism, Utopian and Scientific goes into the differences between scientific socialism and utopian socialism and why scientific socialism is superior.\n\nCapital volumes 1, 2, and 3 are obviously indespensible, but a tough read and hard to understand. You will likely have to read them multiple times to get a firm grasp on them.\n\nCommunist Manifesto and Principles of Communism are good but were very early works of Marx and Engels. In the prefaces to later editions of the Communist Manifesto, it was pointed out by them that no special emphasis was to be put on the 10 immidiate goals of the communist party because so much had changed since the manifesto was written that some of it wasn't applicable. This was largely to do with the creation of the Paris commune that advanced and tweaked a lot of Marx's theories, which he goes into in his book The Civil War In France.\n\nAnti-Duhring by Engels is also really important, though I've only read excerpts as of yet. This is where the Leninist notion of the withering away of the state came from. I believe it was misinterpreted, but you can read it and come to your own conclusion.\n\nEngels Origin of The Family, Private Property, and The State is in some ways based on outdated anthropological research, but it is important in understanding the dialectical historical method of Marxism.\n\nThe main thing I would advise is to read Marx and Engels first before you read secondary sources. A lot of people claim Marx said a lot of things, but you should be able to judge that from your own critical reading rather than taking their word for it.",

I am gonna recommend the book \u201cHow Europe Underdeveloped Africa\u201d to you. It really touches on the importance of anti-imperialism, anti-racism, and anti-capitalism.

I would also recommend the _Manifesto of the Communist Party_, especially the first two chapters. The latter two chapters are good reads, but they involve many references to contemporaneous topics that are somewhat opaque today.\n\nMarx\u2019s _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ are Marx\u2019s notes to himself about party struggles for socialism (recently de-criminalized, at least ostensibly) in Germany. It gives great insight into how Marx conceives of the performance, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor within communism, after the proletarian revolution is finished (most everywhere else Marx is focuses in the capitalist mode of production and distribution with only hints of what can replace it). \n\nWith regard to _Capital_ itself, much of its first chapter is an advanced tutorial in Hegelian metrology and is thus notoriously difficult as introductory material. Some recommend skipping the first chapter because of that. I would not necessarily recommend skipping, but understanding that there is there is this advanced tutorial occupying several sections of the chapter and skimming past it is not a problem and even a good idea (you can always return back to it after reading the rest of _Capital_\u2019s three volumes, which are not at all as difficult and typically a joy to read. Two important segues provide the pivot points of reading Marx\u2019s great work (as in volume I of _Capital_):\n\n* [Chapter 6 at the end](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm#11a) as Marx transitions from discussing the market circulation to discussing the capitalist mode of production that is the aim of this volume up to the next segue (\u201cfree trader vulgaris\u201d, in this segue, is Marx\u2019s zoological taxonomy term for what we today in the US mistakenly call \u201cLibertarians\u201d). \n\n* [Part VII introduction segue](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch23.htm) as Marx transitions from his in-depth analysis of the productive capital process (what contemporary Marxist political economists Resnick and Wolff have dubbed the \u201cfundamental class process\u201d of the performance and appropriation of surplus labor, to the many distributions of surplus labor (what Resnick and Wolff have dubbed the \u201csubsumed class process\u201d), where surplus labor is distributed in various ways peculiar to the capitalist mode of production and distribution, which distributions reproduce the conditions of existence for the continuation of the capitalist mode of production and distribution. Volume I discusses only accumulation as a distribution of surplus labor. The subsequent two volumes discuss the many other distributions of surplus labor (as price deviations, including merchant discounts, interest, market gains in fictitious capital, rents, unproductive labor, and so forth). After discussing accumulation as a distribution of the surplus labor in Part VII, Marx goes on to discuss primitive accumulation: the original sin of the capitalist mode of production and distribution that is not distributions of surplus labor extracted by capitalist exploiters but a historical account of the capitalist mode of production\u2019s genesis.",

Its value, like that of every other commodity, is already fixed before it goes into circulation, since a definite quantity of social labour has been spent upon it; but its use-value consists in the subsequent exercise of its force. The alienation of labour-power and its actual appropriation by the buyer, its employment as a use-value, are separated by an interval of time. But in those cases in which the formal alienation by sale of the use-value of a commodity, is not simultaneous with its actual delivery to the buyer, the money of the latter usually functions as means of payment. [12] In every country in which the capitalist mode of production reigns, it is the custom not to pay for labour-power before it has been exercised for the period fixed by the contract, as for example, the end of each week. In all cases, therefore, the use-value of the labour-power is advanced to the capitalist: the labourer allows the buyer to consume it before he receives payment of the price; he everywhere gives credit to the capitalist. That this credit is no mere fiction, is shown not only by the occasional loss of wages on the bankruptcy of the capitalist, [13] but also by a series of more enduring consequences. [14] Nevertheless, whether money serves as a means of purchase or as a means of payment, this makes no alteration in the nature of the exchange of commodities. The price of the labour-power is fixed by the contract, although it is not realised till later, like the rent of a house. The labour-power is sold, although it is only paid for at a later period. It will, therefore, be useful, for a clear comprehension of the relation of the parties, to assume provisionally, that the possessor of labour-power, on the occasion of each sale, immediately receives the price stipulated to be paid for it.\n> \n> We now know how the value paid by the purchaser to the possessor of this peculiar commodity, labour-power, is determined. The use-value which the former gets in exchange, manifests itself only in the actual utilisation, in the consumption of the labour-power. The money-owner buys everything necessary for this purpose, such as raw material, in the market, and pays for it at its full value. The consumption of labour-power is at one and the same time the production of commodities and of surplus-value. The consumption of labour-power is completed, as in the case of every other commodity, outside the limits of the market or of the sphere of circulation. Accompanied by Mr. Moneybags and by the possessor of labour-power, we therefore take leave for a time of this noisy sphere, where everything takes place on the surface and in view of all men, and follow them both into the hidden abode of production, on whose threshold there stares us in the face \u201cNo admittance except on business.\u201d Here we shall see, not only how capital produces, but how capital is produced. We shall at last force the secret of profit making.\n> \n> This sphere that we are deserting, within whose boundaries the sale and purchase of labour-power goes on, is in fact a very Eden of the innate rights of man. There alone rule Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham. Freedom, because both buyer and seller of a commodity, say of labour-power, are constrained only by their own free will. They contract as free agents, and the agreement they come to, is but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will. Equality, because each enters into relation with the other, as with a simple owner of commodities, and they exchange equivalent for equivalent. Property, because each disposes only of what is his own. And Bentham, because each looks only to himself. The only force that brings them together and puts them in relation with each other, is the selfishness, the gain and the private interests of each. Each looks to himself only, and no one troubles himself about the rest, and just because they do so, do they all, in accordance with the pre-established harmony of things, or under the auspices of an all-shrewd providence, work together to their mutual advantage, for the common weal and in the interest of all.\n> \n> On leaving this sphere of simple circulation or of exchange of commodities, which furnishes the \u201cFree-trader Vulgaris\u201d with his views and ideas, and with the standard by which he judges a society based on capital and wages, we think we can perceive a change in the physiognomy of our dramatis personae. He, who before was the money-owner, now strides in front as capitalist; the possessor of labour-power follows as his labourer. The one with an air of importance, smirking, intent on business; the other, timid and holding back, like one who is bringing his own hide to market and has nothing to expect but \u2014 a hiding.",

This conversion takes place in the market, within the sphere of circulation. The second step, the process of production, is complete so soon as the means of production have been converted into commodities whose value exceeds that of their component parts, and, therefore, contains the capital originally advanced, plus a surplus-value. These commodities must then be thrown into circulation. They must be sold, their value realised in money, this money afresh converted into capital, and so over and over again. This circular movement, in which the same phases are continually gone through in succession, forms the circulation of capital.\n> \n> The first condition of accumulation is that the capitalist must have contrived to sell his commodities, and to reconvert into capital the greater part of the money so received. In the following pages we shall assume that capital circulates in its normal way. The detailed analysis of the process will be found in Book II.\n> \n> The capitalist who produces surplus-value \u2014 i.e., who extracts unpaid labour directly from the labourers, and fixes it in commodities, is, indeed, the first appropriator, but by no means the ultimate owner, of this surplus-value. He has to share it with capitalists, with landowners, &c., who fulfil other functions in the complex of social production. Surplus-value, therefore, splits up into various parts. Its fragments fall to various categories of persons, and take various forms, independent the one of the other, such as profit, interest, merchants\u2019 profit, rent, &c. It is only in Book III. that we can take in hand these modified forms of surplus-value.\n> \n> On the one hand, then, we assume that the capitalist sells at their value the commodities he has produced, without concerning ourselves either about the new forms that capital assumes while in the sphere of circulation, or about the concrete conditions of reproduction hidden under these forms. On the other hand, we treat the capitalist producer as owner of the entire surplus-value, or, better perhaps, as the representative of all the sharers with him in the booty. We, therefore, first of all consider accumulation from an abstract point of view \u2014 i.e., as a mere phase in the actual process of production.\n> \n> So far as accumulation takes place, the capitalist must have succeeded in selling his commodities, and in reconverting the sale-money into capital. Moreover, the breaking-up of surplus-value into fragments neither alters its nature nor the conditions under which it becomes an element of accumulation. Whatever be the proportion of surplus-value which the industrial capitalist retains for himself, or yields up to others, he is the one who, in the first instance, appropriates it. We, therefore, assume no more than what actually takes place. On the other hand, the simple fundamental form of the process of accumulation is obscured by the incident of the circulation which brings it about, and by the splitting up of surplus-value. An exact analysis of the process, therefore, demands that we should, for a time, disregard all phenomena that hide the play of its inner mechanism.",

Peck's film ends with the Manifesto being written, and it will help you understand its context. Most of Marx and Engels' core ideas are already contained in the Manifesto, and it, itself, is a masterpiece of world literature.\n\nAfter that, I would actually recommend reading more contemporary historical and theoretical texts before trying to tackle Capital. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker's [The Many Headed Hydra](https://www.versobooks.com/products/1711-the-many-headed-hydra?srsltid=AfmBOops89Dt4xcurYTD8Z3FB-UPya2sf_Vyh04Kw3IEeOKMdV8bKmHT) is a good Marxist history of the creation of the working class. It draws heavily on Capital. Barbara Field's essay \"Slavery, Race, and Ideology\" is also a great account of racism as ideology of a slave owning society. This ties into a historical materialistic account of culture. You can find it in Field's book [Racecraft](https://www.versobooks.com/products/2270-racecraft). (This will also be useful for thinking about representations of racial difference in literature and so will help you in your AP Lit class.) Kalecki's short essay \"Political Aspects of Full Employment\" is also an important connection to Marxian economics.\n\nWhen you are ready to read Capital, you will want to read it with a companion text. Michael Heinrich's Introduction is probably the best of these. If you just read to read through excerpts of Capital vol 1, the chapters I would recommend focusing on are: 1 (the commodity, value, and commodity fetishism), 6 and 7 (surplus labor time and profit), and 26-28 (the history behind the creation of the working class that Linebaugh and Rediker draw upon).",

It depends on your specific interests in it. \n\nPeople recommend starting with *Value, Price and Profit* or *Wage Labour and Capital* but I think these are bad starting points. For one thing, they're just as abstract as *Capital* itself. There's nothing easier about them. You may as well just read exerpts of *Capital* covering the same material. For another thing, Marx changes and elaborates on a lot of things in *Capital* that are glossed over in these two works and if you take these two as an intro, you're just going to be confused when you read *Capital*. \n\nSince you already have a copy of *Capital*, I'll give you a quick explainer on what that book is about:\n\nMarx's goal in *Capital* is to study capitalism. But not just the specific capitalism of his day. He wants to understand the background laws the operate to greater or lesser degrees in all forms of capitalism. To do this, he constructs a model for how capitalism works in the abstract. He makes this model using a method he borrows from Hegel. He takes a small part of capitalism and thinks about it in the abstract. And then he adds another small part of it, thinking about that abstractly. Then he thinks about how these two small parts interacting in the abstract transform each other. And then he keeps adding little parts of capitalism until his model starts to rise from the abstract to the concrete. Then he starts plugging real world data into his model and tweaking it based on that. \n\nAll that is a little hard to keep track of while you're reading and it's easy to get lost. There are a couple good solutions:\n\n1. Find a good reading group. It's easier to keep track of this if you're reading it with a good group. You can try joining or forming one. \n\n2. Read secondary literature on Marx. This is a good way to get yourself familiar with Marx's language and categories beforehand. But you also have to trust the author to get it right themself and youre going to inheret their biases to a degree. My fav secondary literature on Marx is Michael Heinrich's *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx's Capital* and Simon Clarke's *Marx, Marginalism, and Modern Sociology*. I can give you ebooks/PDFs of either of those. \n\n3. Skip to the later chapters of Volume 1 and go back later on. While you'll be a little bit lost understanding exactly how Marx's model works, this can help you see his language and analysis in action. I personally really like Chapter 10 of volume 1 on the working day. \n\nIf you have a more particular interest in Marxism (history, philosophy, econ, social science, activism, etc.) I can give you more specific recommendations.",

            "body": "\"All history is the history of class struggle\" -- the social development, conflict, and structure, through *modes of production* \\-- makes sense after understanding *historical materialism.* It explains that Marxism is not \"a new system\", it is a *materialist* analysis of history and description of the possibilities, limitations, and exploitation inherent in the current *mode of production* (Capitalism). Understand that Marx has a *technical* meaning to this \"exploitation\" (not a *moralistic* one) -- In class societies, subordinate classes are \"exploited\" in the sense that they must labour for the dominant classes.\n\nOne you understand that *class* is the *technical* descriptor of someone's *relation to production,* how this *exploitation* produces *class* *conflict* (not some \"rich vs poor\" or \"West vs Global South\" dichotomy), then you can understand how class conflict has happened in history -- how the bourgeois revolution (eg. French Revolution), against the clergy and nobility, carried the world from Feudalism to Capitalism, from one *mode of production* to another. Then understand how Capitalism, having brought innovation and \"civilisation\" to all corners of the world, relies on infinite exponential growth to continuously reinvent and sustain itself. Then understand that Capitalism will constantly go through *crises of overproduction* (see *TRPF*), and, having proletarianised the majority of people, produces its own inevitable downfall.\n\nUnderstand what *revisionism* and *opportunism* is, in the Marxist sense -- Do not distract yourself with \"Marxist-Leninism\", because it is neither Marxist nor Leninist. Understand that the Soviet Union, Cuba, the CCP, etc. etc. were never communist nor socialist. To understand Communism, read Marx and Engels. Avoid Parenti and the like.\n\nHowever, start small. Marxist theory is dense. Don't be afraid to read through Wikipedia articles on these terms and the following texts. Listen to episodes 10.3 and 10.4 of the *Revolutions* podcast (this will give you a cliff notes rundown on *historical materialism)*. Read Engels' *Principles of Communism* (the last chapter about Communism vs Socialism is important here) *and* the *Manifesto,* but understand these are written more like persuasive essays and not necessarily \"theory\" (however, it talks more about what is discussed here). Read *Das Kapital,* chapters 1 & 2, then reread it *multiple* times. Read *The German Ideology* (my favourite text), which talks about the *division of labour* and the ruling bourgeois ideology. Learn about the German Revolution and how it failed in the face of bourgeois reaction (eg. fascism), opportunism and counter-revolution (eg. social-democracy, liberalism) -- watch Jonas \u010ceika's three-part series on YouTube. Then read Lenin and Luxemburg (*Reform or Revolution*, *State and Rev*, etc.), who are excellent critics of modern bourgeois government/electoralism and bourgeois reformism, and on organising revolution and working practically towards the negation of capitalism. Then leave Reddit. Go insane. \"Read, read, read\" as Lenin said.",
