    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand where it all comes from. I wont use the examples of having inherited business or being born in a rich family or anything of that sort. Let's assume you take the easiest route of stepping up the socioeconomic ladder, which is let's say via education. All self-made, you studied at uni, passionate for learning and growth, got a phD research position, got to network with a lot with people from the field, travelled, received fancy offers from large corporations, landed an insanely high-paying job (way above minimum wage, way more than enough to live a comfortable, lush life). Would you still bash capitalism? Would capitalism still be your problem?\n\nI don't understand where this argument comes from. How does someone being rich affect you being a waiter if you never strived for more in life? How does someone else having more affect you having less? Even if you were born with absolutely nothing, even if it takes you longer to get there, you can absolutely change your fortune by taking action, become something, be successful... I can understand the frustration of living off breadcrumbs and minimum wage, corporations exploiting people, hectic working conditions etc ... but would it still be exploitation if you worked for let's say 30 grand a month or more? Like does the whole capitalism hate stem from being poor/having less opportunities, does it come from dissatisfaction with the \"rich people attitude\" or people are legit allergic to this system? (even if they were in the position of strongly benefiting from it). I am asking for genuine insights.",

            "body": "First of all, you seem to know nothing about how capitalism and the world we live in works.\n\nThe sentences \"Why would a waiter be mad although he didn't strive for more\" and \"How does other people being rich affect you being poor\" makes it obvious that you have no idea how capitalism works. We are not bothered by other people living comfortable, no. We are bothered by the fact that they use other's endeavor to make themselves comfortable while others do not have good lives.\n\n(The term \"bourgeoisie\" is for the people who possess the means of production and make more money by exploiting their workers' work: factories, schools, hospitals, property, buildings, machines for production etc.)\n\nThe way you think \"If you were comfortable, would you still be against it?\" is not a good argument unless the person is from bourgeoisie, in which you (almost always) have to be born to be a member of. People with high wages, they may seem like they benefit from the system, but they are still slaves to bourgeoisie, still have to create surplus for them and are waged workers \u2014 just a higher wage. The only ones benefiting from capitalism is the bourgeoisie. \n\nI guess that you think people work hard to get money in the capitalist system. That is not true. People don't get rich because \"they worked hard, and cleverly!\". An artist, a scientist or an author can work hard and cleverly, too. The bourgeoisie consists of people who know how to benefit from the capitalist system, and that is why it only benefits them. If \"work hard\" was the case, 3 workers alone would get more money than the CEO because they put more endeavor. So, that is one wrong perception you should change.\n\n\nI am currently a Marxist and I am one of those \"working hard to have a high wage job\" people you mentioned. My educational journey was extraordinarily successful. I will be a Marxist years later when I'm put to work too: I will know that I work for someone to get richer, and that although I'm getting good money, my fellow human beings are being oppressed.",

            "body": "Hello,  \nI am a very hardline communist, but I make a fair amount of money (Think a very good sales role in the B2B sector), I'm essentially the hypothetical guy from your post. I may take some flak from lefties, but I'm still a worker, and last time I checked being in the labour aristocracy does not discriminate you from being a proletarian. And even if, then I would be a class traitor, just as Engels was.\n\nCapitalism is very much the problem. I could go down the moralistic route and tell you that I am not indifferent to the suffering of others even though I don't hurt that much. I could go down the egotistic route, saying that I'm still very much closer to being homeless than being in the 1 %, or I could argue that it's still impossible for me to buy a home because of the fucked up idea that housing is a commodity and not a basic human right. Both of those are absolutely true, but I'd consider them to be frankly pretty weak arguments.\n\nLet's look at this from a scientific point of view, marxism is a science after all. It's not that somebody simply being rich affects others (although that is also kind of true), it's about the incentives to become rich, the mechanisms by which one becomes rich (theft and exploitation) and most importantly the mechanisms by which one remains rich.\n\nThe easiest thing I could point to is the absolute destruction of the environment that we see, it's entirely caused by the endless need to raise profits and by rampant consumerism, the capitalist economy can only function if there's shit being bought and sold, and not only that, we need more stuff to be bought and sold with each passing year. It's absolutely insane, \"Infinite growth with finite resources\" and such. This tendency is worsening because of the falling rate of profit.\n\nThe next thing that may not be as obvious is general development of humankind. It really is either socialism or barbarism. Think about all the imperialist wars that are raging even right now. Then there's fascism, which really is only capitalism in crisis. And capitalism will always either be in a crisis or waiting for the next one. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather look with hope towards the future, I'd much rather envision a future where automation won't mean starvation and job loss, but it would mean that people could focus on stuff like poetry, gardening, art, science, building a better future for everyone. If we let capitalism reign supreme, the future we're looking at is fucking bleak, with everything being commodified and the planet eventually completely fucking destroyed, fascistic governments of the rich ruling everything.\n\nYou cannot do away with the internal contradictions within capitalism, they make all of what I said not a possibility, but an inevitability. To answer your question in brief:  \nNobody really benefits from capitalism (unless you're in the top 0.01 %), the only benefit you may actually get is being able to enjoy empty pleasures as you go gently into the good good night. Capitalism is a rotten system, it is working exactly as intended and in only some 200 odd years it has caused a devastation so absolutely massive that I don't believe we really fully understand just how destructive it actually is and it will take us centuries to fix it.\n\nThe only way out is to abolish it. As Rosa Luxemburg said: It's either socialism or barbarism.\n\nEDIT: I hope I answered your question. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're asking this in good faith and genuinely just wanted to learn something that spiked your interest. If that's correct feel free to ask me any followup questions, I'd be happy to answer.",

They each have very different interpretations of economics, and being left-wing doesn't automatically mean they are anti-capitalist. \n\nI can only speak for Marxists. If one is an actual Marxist, becoming wealthy would not impact their ideological outlook, as this is an understanding of the world that goes beyond capitalism. For example, Marx and Engels were both born wealthy. Marx would lose that wealth as a result of his political activities, but Engels used his wealth to promote their ideology and the Communist cause. \n\nThe people who would go from anti-capitalist to pro-capitalist (simply because of their situation) aren't ideological. They are just angry, perhaps justifiably, about said situation. You should read more on Marxism and Capitalism to get a good grounding in why we support the ideology.",

It\u2019s not a moralism or even based off of personal self interest but of the self interest of the whole class of workers. An individual can have really any justification to be a socialist. Wanting to end racial or sexual and gendered oppression is a significant one. Socialism provides a framework and vehicle to understand and end all forms of oppression. \n\nHell Engels was a rich white man that mechanically had no class interest or personally anything to gain from socialism and he still wanted to due to his own personal motivations. He is an outlier but worth highlighting. Even a wealthy person or member of the petit bourgeoise can have a scientific understanding of oppression and exploitation and want to do something about it due to whatever reason. I\u2019m certainly not working class or at least I come from a petit bourgeoise family that serves capital. If I acted purely based on my material interests or the liberal concept of envy of someone who has more than me the best thing I could do is further capitalism and advance myself in it. I want to destroy it though and dedicate my life to destroying it with a vengeful passion. There\u2019s a hundred reasons why. Ending suffering and exploitation of those around me. Putting a stop to the various ills of class society which is a sick society. I want to live in a liberated world and want everyone around me to live in that too.

            "body": "I got radicalized IN a decently paying job.  Because I was subjected to a core, crippling problem of Capitalism: Capital owners.  Our owner was a nice guy.  I even would have called him a friend.  But he did not know what he was doing and the only reason he was in charge was he owned Capital.  We were all way more knowledgeable about the business than him.  He just could not stop fucking up.  And I have been in many more jobs since and before.  All run by people who bought their way in.  That job was the moment I realized just how ludicrous the core conceit of this system is.  That it doesn't reward being good and knowledgeable at your job with the power to do it better.  It instead gives that decision making power to people who generally do not understand your field and often has negative incentives to actually try.  And when capital owners fail, they usually can recover.  But we get ruined for months or even years.\n\nCan people like us start a company?  Sure, if we want to risk complete financial ruin because we aren't starting with a huge pile of money and business school connections.  And by risk, I mean statistically speaking, flipping a coin for if you survive 5 years.  If the stakes are people's livelihoods, those people deserve to have a say (if not the final say) on decisions that effect them.\n\nAnd that was BEFORE I started really considering Imperialism and the Climate Disaster.\n\nBecause make no mistake, if I hadn't been radicalized by the job, I would have been radicalized by the sheer compulsive behavior of Capital regarding climate change.  Which is the previous behavior on steroids.  The deaths of billions (including us) are on the line, and yet Capitalists and Capital cannot help but delay so damned long we're about to hit the methane fields in glaciers.  Even capitalists who once pretended to care were investing in oil and buying climate deniers congress seats while making electric cars.  They are slaves to the market they made and they will die with the rest of us because they can't help themselves.  That IS my problem.  It's everyone's problem.
