Drawing from psychoanalytic theory, particularly the concepts of the super-ego and introjection, it examines how individuals in capitalist societies internalize external pressures, leading to cycles of overwork, self-exploitation, and guilt. The essay also delves into the paradox of hoarding in obsessional neurotics, comparing it to capitalism's compulsive accumulation of wealth. Ultimately, it argues that both the neurotic individual and capitalist systems are trapped in an endless pursuit of perfection and control, perpetuating dissatisfaction and instability.",

Think, for example, of the biblical Joseph advising the pharaoh that he shall store all the excess of the grain production for the coming years of famine.\u00a0So It seems to me that, viewed through your lens, hoarding would predate capitalism, and that your theoretical schema runs the danger of losing historical specificity when describing capitalism.",

Unlike pre-capitalist economies, which were often defined by subsistence or cyclical modes of production, capitalism operates on the principle of endless accumulation \u2014 not merely for survival, **but for its own sake**\n\nClearly hoarding has always been an urge in humans (and proto-humans, as long as there have been sapient hominids with sufficient brainpower to model potential futures) but the article's point is that capitalism is an economic system that actively stokes this acquisitive urge for ends explicitly uncoupled from all conceivable physical needs, and with systemic imperatives that syngerise so seamlessly with our internal neurotic drive. \n\nTo continue the analogy between capitalism and the obsessional neurotic: someone owning possessions and wanting nice things isn't a pathological condition, it's just basic nest-building and acquisitiveness that is universal to humans. But when that urge has exploded to the point that they're living in tunnels between 60 years worth of newspapers and jars of their own poop, it's the *intensity* that natural human acquisitiveness has been allowed to reach that is causing the problem.",

It is just not true that pre-capitalist societies operated primarily on subsistence or other non-accumulatory models. Accumulation is not a new thing under capitalism, it is at least as old as agriculture. And survival was never the goal of this surplus extraction and temporary hoarding that was conducted by the ruling classes.\u00a0Thus, if we want to psychoanalyze the phenomenon of societal \"hoarding,\" we can not simply contrast capitalism with pre-capitalism.\n\nFurthermore, the (classical) capitalist accumulation driven by profit for profit's sake is hardly comparable to the individual psychopathology of hoarding, it actually even fits better with primitive accumulation. Under capitalism, the surplus is never allowed to just lie around, like in a messy house. It has to be reinvested in commodity production over and over again to generate more profit. Collecting huge piles of junk in your house is at least a human goal, no matter how pathological, while profit for profit's sake is purely nihilistic and non-human process.",
