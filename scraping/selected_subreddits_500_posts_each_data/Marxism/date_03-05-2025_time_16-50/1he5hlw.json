The first section is some of Marx\u2019s best prose, though, and is the most widely quoted section by far, so I would definitely read that and maybe just look up some of the references if necessary. If you want to dig deeper there is, finally, an excellent and readable history of the 1848 revolutions which is what I\u2019d recommend anyone who wants a handle on what was going on read - Revolutionary Spring: Europe Aflame and the Fight for a New World, 1848-1849 by Christopher Clark",

Eu acho que tendo uma edicao com boas notas de rodap\u00e9 ajuda. \n\nTem um canal do YT da Profa. Salviatti, o nome \u00e9 Kanal Marx.
