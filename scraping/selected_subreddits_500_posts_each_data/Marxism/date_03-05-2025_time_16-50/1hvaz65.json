BUT EXACTLY HOW IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE ....you get a bit into movie critiques and suddenly your whole feed is WOKE DEAD POST WOKE ERA DIVERSITY BAD blah blah blah so like why is hollywood being the centerpeice for this whole culture war?? has this happened before or is this always happening like the satanic panic?? idk (well duh ofc it has since art and media are inherently political due it being born from the present societal and economic)",

Liberating the proletariat means liberation from imperialism, means liberation from cishetpatriarchy, means liberation from white supremacist racial power structures - because all these systems of oppression are fundamentally intertwined with the capitalist system. \n\nAnd its also the other way around, liberating lgbt/racialised/disabled etc comrades requires anti capitalist work, because capitalism requires the subclassing and exploitation of certain groups of the proletariat to sustain itself. Liberals will fight the culture wars the right facetiously manufactures, but inevitably throw the minorities they pretend to be allies for under the bus, because they're commited to capitalism. Ultimately they're opposed to radical, liberative thought and action",

The right has definitely won the battle for mass communications.",

The culture industry, like any other, exists to maximize returns on capital investment, not to promote normative political values. What investors think will sell is what the studios make, and given that the target demographics of box office hits are younger, less ethnically homogenous, and more socially liberal than right-wing cranks on Facebook, it just happens to look like it\u2019s a plot from the standpoint of the conspiraboomer hive mind",

It distracts from oppression, from inequality, and from clear perceptions of the system in terms of how it addresses problems. \n\nThe \"woke\" culture war service late stage capitalism from that perspective.  The issues may be real enough.  But the underlying issue is that everything gets easier and more easier to navigate when there's enough going around that everyone easily gets housing, community, free time, and many paths that bring meaning by serving the community. \n\nUnfortunately the \"oppressed\" has been gaslit to the point where most people don't see the difference between the loudest voice and those struggling to survive.",
