Most of the monarchy now seems to be more ceremonial.\n\nIt would be start for Canada and Australia to remove self from monarchy and be republic and talk about crimes in school what they did to natives and crimes of the past?\n\nWhen I think of monarchy I think of racist, genocidal, colonialist the British did to those countries.\n\n",

(No, I don't want to hear anything about repression of \"convoy protesters\" \\[actually far right putschists\\] in Ottawa)\n\nIf we're stuck in the confines of bourgeois representative \"democracy\", I'd much prefer our model here in Canada to the model in the US, which effectively has a 4-8 year King with actual powers.",

The king of England wasn\u2019t in Canada directing the cultural assimilation and ethnic cleansing of the native peoples \u2014 it was the Hudson Bay Company. Yes, acting in the interest of and at the leisure of the crown, but they were essentially entirely independent and controlled swathes of land bigger than most countries. The people forcing or tricking the tribes off their lands were doing it because it had monetary value, and the people themselves were exploited for their labor. Many of them were killed because they were inconveniencing the accumulation of capital for the shareholders (and I guess the crown), with the HBC outright going to war against some tribes. \n\nLater on with the establishment of the disgusting residential school system (established by the Catholic Church and the Canadian government), the natives had been living on reservations. Put there unwillingly, isolated because reserves were on the edge of town and without any basic infrastructure, the people in power realized they had an unexploited pool of labor. The children were taken, given new names, forced to speak only English, and wear western clothing. The results were disastrous and horrific. \n\nThe crown you could say, had oversight of all this, and even benefited financially from it. The King has a representative in Canada at the federal level that technically *can* influence parliament. But I think that unhelpfully redirects the criticism away from capitalists \u2014 capitalists coordinated this in pursuit of more capital.\n\nThis sort of thing continues to happen to this day \u2014 and there\u2019s no monarchies left. Not really. When a mining company chases a tribe off their land and uses goons to intimidated or kill their leaders, well, isn\u2019t that the same thing? No king needed. \n\nCanada has a monarchy because it\u2019s built into the constitution. That won\u2019t change any time soon under the current regime, and probably won\u2019t until socialist revolution. For now, the king is a largely ceremonial role and really should be the least of anyone\u2019s concerns.",

The English civil war lead to bourgeois republic that was held together by Cromwell and when he died they reverted back to monarchy with Charles II. When he died his dip shit brother James I became king and tried reversing all the gains made by the bourgeois. \n\nThey kicked his ass out for that and installed James daughter Mary and more importantly her Dutch husband William III. William being Dutch (The Netherlands are the birthplace of our form of capitalism) was very open to class collaboration with the English bourgeoisie. Basically William was cool with capitalism and was happy to be a king with less power than his successor. \n\nThis created a unique version of bourgeois society that still carries a little piece of the old feudal order in it. That system spread to Canada and Australia and the bourgeois of both those countries haven\u2019t changed it for whatever reason. I\u2019m sure some people like it and some hate it but eventually these countries got their own sovereignty where Charles III is still king but they get to make their own laws separate from the UK. \n\nAlso if either country\u2019s proletariat ever gets a little too uppity, the crown is a great way to pull off a coup. \n\nSee an example here:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis",

We established the racist, genocidal systems here in these colonial nations that we perpetuate to this day.\n\nAside from that, personally I think good international relations are fundamental to lasting peace. Keeping cultural ties to Great Britain serves us well and keeps us connected with our history. I believe that understanding where we came from is fundamental to planning for the future, and ensuring we don't repeat the mistakes of the past.
