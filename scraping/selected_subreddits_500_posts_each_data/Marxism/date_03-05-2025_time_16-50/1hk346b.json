WHY this is legal and why in Europe they have stricter laws on political lobbying.\n\nIn the US Republican Party and Democratic Party pro big businesses and is rotten to core. But how does this political lobbying work that make them that way.\n\nPeople also make reference other reason the Clinton foundation so rich and wealthy is other reason they so corrupt so pro big businesses that Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama have millions of dollars the same with Republican Party like Bush or Trump and they far remove from the working class people. How did the foundation get to pint they have millions and millions of dollars being so rich.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

FEC (2010) Supreme Court decision that Pres Jimmy Carter siad meant the US was 'an oligary with unlimited political bribery' which protected the right of corporations to give money to political campaigns by essentially ruling that, constituionally speaking, money is a form of speech and corporations are just considered groups of individuals who have freedom of speech, so can't be limited in that respect -- you can see it in force now with Elon Musk threatening to put money towards unseating current Republican politicians if they voted for legislation that Bernie Sanders had advocated for to solve the current workers' rights issues in the US - which the Replubican had actually agreed to voting for before Musk issued his threat",

            "body": "Lobbying is just when a person or a group reaches out to elected officials and tries to get them to vote one way or another on legislation. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with it in theory. Elected officials in the United States and Europe have what is called a free mandate which means they can vote however they want, even if it runs counter to what the elected campaigned on or what their party wants them to do. Lobbying is a result of that free mandate. \n\nYou then have this political mechanism called a political action committee or PAC. So If you and I want to support some candidate or like Medicare for all we can create a PAC and spend whatever money we want on advertisements or on campaign contributions to candidates we like. Now there are limits on how much money we can give a politician, but what we can do instead is just run our own ads for that position ourselves, there\u2019s no limit to that. \n\nThe problem is that in the United States corporations have a sort of personhood where corporations can behave a lot like you or I would. This means that a private company like Coca Cola can also lobby elected officials. \n\nOn top of that the Supreme Court ruling called citizens United you mentioned says that the contribution of money to a political party or candidate or political project is a form of speech protected under the first amendment. Citizens United also ruled that corporations were allowed to contribute money to PACS where there are limits to contributions. \n\nNow a politician can\u2019t actually run their own PACs and contribute money to themselves or run campaign ads for themselves. They can however have their friends or family start a PAC that supports them. \n\nSo basically you have this campaign mechanism called a PAC that can accept unlimited money from people or corporations and that PAC can run someone\u2019s entire campaign for them. \n\nSo what makes lobbying corrupt over here state side is that if Dow Chemical wants to stop some law that says they can pollute waterways, all they have to do is set a meeting with whatever elected officials they think they can get to agree with them, and they can put a million dollars in whatever PAC supports that politician before that meeting. If that sounds like bribery it\u2019s because it is, and it\u2019s completely legal.",

            "body": "In the big picture sense, lobbying is almost redundant, because of course the capitalist government will protect its own interest. But then again it's a mistake to think of capitalist powers as a monolith -- so different industries jockey for position under each administration, fighting petty rivalries among each other to get prime attention from whoever is in charge.\n\nAt this point, the process of lobbying money, favor-for-favor, and the publicity/mutual interest deals for politicians both during & after office are basically streamlined. You've heard of the \"revolving door\" between DC politics and DC lobbying on behalf of private interests.\n\nUnlike what many well intentioned liberals believe, lobbying does not cause corruption per se but is a symptom of it. If Citizens United were overturned, it would be a step in the right direction don't get me wrong, but it doesn't really change the reality of class interests coinciding between business and politics in the US.",

A million is nothing for an ex-president of the US. They're not that interesting to corporations anymore as their political sway has diminished.",
