    "selftext": "I'm reading Wage Labor and Capital, and I have a question. I'm at this point:\n\n>Whatever be the power of the means of production which are employed, competition seeks to rob capital of the golden fruits of this power by reducing the price of commodities to the cost of production; in the same measure in which production is cheapened - i.e., in the same measure in which more can be produced with the same amount of labour \u2013 it compels by a law which is irresistible a still greater cheapening of production, the sale of ever greater masses of product for smaller prices. Thus the capitalist will have gained nothing more by his efforts than the obligation to furnish a greater product in the same labour-time; in a word, more difficult conditions for the profitable employment of his capital. While competition, therefore, constantly pursues him with its law of the cost of production and turns against himself every weapon that he forges against his rivals, the capitalist continually seeks to get the best of competition by restlessly introducing further subdivision of labour and new machines, which, though more expensive, enable him to produce more cheaply, instead of waiting until the new machines shall have been rendered obsolete by competition\n\nAs I understand M, capitalists wear themselves down by forcing their hand to industrialize further and further. \n\nBut... shouldn't that lower the price of goods? More industrialization = more production = less expensive goods. It sounds like the capitalist is unwittingly bettering the living conditions by being enthralled by a production obsession. Workers would be squeezed during their shifts but when they get home they can go shopping for consummer stuff. And since capitalists are trapped in this cycle of mass production, they're the ones footing the bill of progress.\n\nSeeing the 21rst century, I'm aware industry artificially keep prices up by disposing excess goods: creating landfills with perfect products just to avoid lowering prices. Or worst yet, killing just-hatched/born animals or leaving fruit/grains unharvested to rot in the fields to keep food prices \"stable\". That way their profit margin stays the same and avoid the trap I descrived on the previous paragraph. \n\nSo, in theory, the rat-race of industrial innovation *should* benefit the working class by making goods affordable. That would be the heart of Keynesian economics, no? *But* capitalists artificially negate this by price manipulation, which is a key component of Neoliberalism. Am I right? \n\n",

Stuff like TVs got way cheaper and better. The stuff that skyrocketed in price (education, healthcare, housing) were all operating along different dynamics to industrial capitalism.\n\nIt turned out that cheap TVs didnt make up for paying $150,000 for a degree, $11,000 to visit the hospital and $850k for a house.\n\nI still think that this is not the whole story - the intersection of industrial capitalism and imperialism has pushed prices of industrial commodities to almost absurdly low levels (I bought some electronics from China the other day that were stupid cheap) and will skyrocket them at some point (when the China tap gets cut off).",

If, suddenly, everything were much cheaper, the wage worker would find their wages contracting until they can only buy what they could buy with their old wage - whatever is necessary for them to go back to work tomorrow.\n\nThis is also why things like taxes are completely irrelevant to the proletariat.",

As you say, if you don\u2019t have a high degree of competition\u2014which many modern industries do not\u2014then this process does not take place. Marx argued that capitalism improved the absolute standard of living as a whole, so he wasn\u2019t troubled by this tendency.    \n\n> That would be the heart of Keynesian economics, no? \n\nKind of the opposite, actually. Neoliberals and laissez-faire thinkers are focused on the benefits of competition (the downward pressure on prices being a big one) and therefore believe that the state should leave the market to operate on its own. Keynes\u2019 big argument in the *General Theory* was that the market, left to its own devices, was prone to equilibrating below its maximal capacity, and needed state intervention toward full employment. In other words, Keynes is known as one of the foundational people who said that competition was not enough, and his and his successors\u2019 opponents (Hayek, Friedman, etc.) essentially disagreed.",

Keynesianism became prominent during the New Deal era that eventually became the Golden Age of Liberal economics during the 1960s. As you said, K believed Free Market is not enough and the Govmt had to plan the economy, making sure there was \"a chicken in every pot and a car in each garage\" (in order to descredit/challenge the USSR). K was, as I understand, a non-marxist socialist that did not believe in class strugged (since he was a british aristocrat).\n\nDuring the 70s big-money businessmen/tax payers got tired of footing the bill so they concocted, through Think Tanks, Neoliberalism, which is the worship of Supreme Free Market. And during the 80s all benefits got rolled over and dismantled by Reagan and Thatcher. \n\nGoing back to my post, K wanted the govmt to pay for Progress. To have big-money tax payers to pay the bill to secure society and progress. Which, in my mind, match the scenario M is describing as the rat-race of industrial innovation.",

Neoliberalism was in some respects a response to Keynesian policies (particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom), but I wouldn\u2019t call it \u201cthe opposite.\u201d Neoliberals believe that the best way to stimulate economic growth is to leave the market to itself, where competition will drive prices down, lead to innovation, and employ people. Keynesianism came after some of these basic ideas were promulgated by people like Marshall and Pigou, and Keynes was methodologically very similar to these two; he simply believed that the free market was not perfectly self-regulating, and identified its tendency toward crisis sans government intervention.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I understand your interpretation of the Marx quote. Marx isn\u2019t being prescriptive, he\u2019s just naming a well known fact about competition. Marx\u2019s ideal economy ultimately wouldn\u2019t contain market competition.",

            "body": "He's talking about competition amongst capitalists which \"drives down the prices\" of commodities. Whether it is cheaper inputs or increased output (or both), the capitalist needs an edge to beat its competitors lest it go out of business. The result of this is commodities that are cheaper and more abundant, at the cost of the portion of profit the capitalist retains. It should be noted that this is not strictly applicable to the monopoly stage of capitalism.\n\nYou did stumble upon one of the main contradictions of capitalism in your question about workers, though. The cost of wage labor is the first thing the capitalist goes after, as workers necessarily must earn less per product than they produce, and it is the one input whose cost can be reduced through the maintenance of a reserve army of labor (the unemployed). This contributes to the boom and bust cycles we see in capitalist markets.\n\nAlso, the idea that workers are only \"squeezed during their shift\" misses several historical examples of how capitalists have sought to monopolize, eg company towns, slavery, etc. which squeeze them at all points. Additionally I would disagree that capitalists are footing the bill of progress, as that statement simply ignores the contributions of labor.\n\nRegarding your question about all this industrialization benefitting workers, it did in fact do that. Compared to the fuedal system, capitalism is quite progressive and allowed for many more products to reach people at more affordable prices. Today, however, in the monopoly stage of capitalism, we see what you have described to artificially maintain scarcity. Lenin's book Imperialism the highest stage of capitalism better describes that stage of capitalism, and I'm slowly being swayed by Yanis Varoufakis's idea of technofuedalism to describe what we are currently living through.",

            "body": "The price of commodities is driven down by increases in labour productivity. These increases are driven by automation and other technical innovations that lower the average time it takes to produce a commodity. This process affects not only wage goods  but also means of production i.e. machinery itself. The tendency towards the increase in the productivity of labour therefore also engenders a tendency towards the devaluation of commodities including constant capital i.e. machinery and building buildings.\n\nOf course, numerous other counter tendencies can offset that, causing monetary inflation. And monetary inflation can itself be seen as a form of devaluation: the devaluation of wages. \n\nHowever it is important to recognise that this devaluation process does not free capitalism from its tendency to crisis. The proportion of each dollar invested that then translates into surplus unpaid labour is reduced by each new element of constant capital that is introduced into the productive process. The devaluation of constant capital does not permanently offset that decline in profitability. Because for each new innovation the capitalist grosses up the scale of production. The gross proportional change therefore tends to towards decline in profitability, albeit one that can be temporarily offset by manifold other factors.\n\nThe fundamental driver here is capital's imperative  to increase profit by increasing surplus value, either by increasing the intensity of labour, or by reducing the cost of labour power via a reduction in the value of wage goods i.e. commodities that the worker consumes, or of course in a more absolute way by extending the length of the working day.\n\nTherefore in this process, competition is the catalyst but not the fundamental cause. As Marx says,  \"competition executes the inner laws of capital, but it does not invent them\".\n\nI think that's right based on my reading of volume one and three of Capital and some notes on devaluation in  Theories of Surplus Value.\n\nSorry perhaps a little garbled in places: it's still early here",
