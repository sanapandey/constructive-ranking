    "selftext": "This might be an odd question, but I have been going through some hard times recently and have found that the dominant view of psychiatry/psychology (mental health as an isolated issue individuals deal with, self help/psychotherapy over community building, etc.) are not very effective on me at all. I've been trying to seek some literature that would serve a sort of \"self-help\" purpose but isn't doused with cognitive behavioral therapy/self-improvement speak. Reading most Marxist/critical theory/commentary does help me in some degree to feel more in touch with the world around me, but I am specifically hoping for something with a more hopeful/optimistic note than something purely critical. I know this is incredibly vague, but I guess I am just grasping at straws here lol. Need some transcendence in my life rn",

Comrades and the movement are what lift you up and inspire you. Such talented and driven people selflessly fighting for a better world rub off on you.",

It follows some Kentucky miners as they carried out a strike for over a year to secure better wages. Seeing their level of organization and class consciousness was impressive. There was a bittersweet element to seeing how much has changed since the '70s when it was filmed. But I still think it's worth a watch. (It's currently available on HBO Max in the U.S. if you have it.)",

But the whole book is kind of about Occupy somehow (I mean in my mind)\u2026 it\u2019s like a gothic-marxist fantasy/sci-fi and idk about what it feels subconsciously to yearn for a better world and know it is within reach despite being surrounded by decay and repeatedly hit with defeat. It\u2019s bittersweet and helped me process some feelings about that experience.\n\nIt\u2019s the third in a loose series about a fantasy future quasi-London. The first is Perdido Street Station which is also fantastic and I wish HBO had made it a series around the time Game of Thrones was starting to air. (I think they would have messed it up too much if they made it after GoT blew up in popularity.)\n\nI think Perdido has a depiction of a militant labor strike by amphibian people who work in the river. It also has inter dimensional spiders who speak in rhyming iambic pentameter\u2026 also sentient rubbish piles. It\u2019s quite good.",

Most (good) therapists will meet you where you're at and respond to how you're thinking, not force you into their way of thinking.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThe man who seeks greater political radicalism in response to personal angst and mental health gives me the same feeling as the depressed man who asks for a vodka at 2pm.
