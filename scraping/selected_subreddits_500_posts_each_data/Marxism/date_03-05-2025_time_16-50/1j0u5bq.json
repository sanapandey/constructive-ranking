    "selftext": "Hey everyone, im new to the sub reddit and I thought I would initiate my participation with a fairly simple yet pertinent question, especially given the current social climate around the world.\n\nI am interested to hear your opinions on the value of LGBTQ+ advocacy within the context of Marxist theory and revolution.\n\nTo clairify, my question is; does the representation of LGBTQ+ people factor as a primairy demand in Marxist values today and is it important to advocate on behalf of those individuals (and other marginalized groups by extension) in the name of the Marxist cause?\n\nAs for my opinion:\nI would assume it is amoung the most important causes to further especially when representing the working class as we can all see the corporate tendancy to exploit LGBTQ+ values for sales profit and then dump them as soon as the market allows for it is blatantly anti-proletarian in nature. I know the early Bolsheveks in Russia were against anti-semitism and I see homophobic discrimination as an extension of the same thought process and thus should be disintegrated from our society. In that way I feel it is of the utmost importance to stand for our comrades in their struggle for recognition and help them organize to the best of our ability in concert with our struggle.",

That mission should support LGBTQ+ people just as much as anyone else, but focusing on the aesthetic issues can be a distraction from material issues affecting people. If Marxists organize around waving rainbow flags everywhere, and then corporations and capital owners start waving their own rainbow flags, it might create a false sense of unity across the divides of exploitation.",

And so while any Marxist will stand firmly on the side of the oppressed, whether it\u2019s on the basis of their race, gender, or other factor, we see that at the heart of all these issues is the question of class. As Malcolm X said, you can\u2019t have capitalism without racism. In the same vein, you cannot overcome homophobia or transphobia inside of capitalism",

So maybye it is this chicken or the egg issue still at a certain point you just have to make up your mind and say it is one or the other as that is paradoxical. We agree that Capitalism is one of the causes of this suffering, and while I lead this conversation with the discussion of LGTBQIA+ rights, I also imply the rights of all peoples by extension. The field of debate will not be enough and neither will brute force it must be a combination of both in order to revolutionize both sides of the dialectical materialist wheel at once.\n\n The wheel comes in waves, and we saw the first wave for Communism with Marx and Engles. Then came the second wave in the time of the Soviet Union and China (and other revolutions). Now we are at a time that, for me all analysis points to a third wave arriving that can not be withheld by any force. If we are careful in our application of these values, then we stand a chance at making it to a golden age in human history. But don't take my word for it. Let our labors speak for themselves.",

I\u2019m sure your smart, maybe your an excellent uni student, but this is a mistake many movements have and are currently making. Queer Marxism, post modernism, or intersectionality are ideas born from intellectuals all trying to add contributions to way smarter theoreticians that laid it out pretty clear 100 years ago. And while there\u2019s always news things to learn, these abstractions have only caused betrayal, defeats of movements, and reformism. Id advise not to stray heavily from the issue of class, as you\u2019re only going to confuse and distract workers. Continue to make your way through theory, and keep reading before trying to release the KortexFoxo communist manifesto",

(so, if I'm grossly misinterpreting Marxist concepts please let me know). But I know what is valuable for me and for people in my community which at the end of the day is very important to any system of good governance. Most discussions about Marxism or even vague Communism in my life have been an endless slop of the same talking points. Normally I'm trying simply to justify having an opinion in this society which, can be very frustrating as I rarely get to ask more experienced students of Marxist theory any questions about it, which is the whole reason I wanted to join this community. I still believe the demands and end goal remain the same. If I am trying to tweak anything at this point, it's mainly only for my own understanding and not to impose my thoughts as \"the truth\" on anyone else in any way so I'm sorry if it seems like that. Maybe I would have had the chance to ask other students about it if I had gone to Collage but as you know that can be very expensive, too expensive for me right now anyhow. Btw it would be goofy af to call it the Kortexfoxo Manifesto I hadn't really thought about that, lol \ud83d\ude16.",

I mostly differentiate the advocacy and aesthetics because I think it\u2019s possible that trans folks will reach a place of acceptance before there is the generational change Marxism is calling for.\n\nIf I were a trans person I would be happy that Marxists exist, because they support my material needs regardless of my identity. At the same time, I would want the biggest tent of people to advocate for me. A Republican Supreme Court nominee ended the gay marriage issue in the United States. The type of class conscious society Marxists advocate for would be inherently more supportive of trans folks than the current situation, so why try to shift the aesthetics of the movement, or how it\u2019s perceived.\n\nBasically my answer is that Marxism is a bigger umbrella ideology, which as-is covers trans rights, and includes many trans people. Trans people should also have a precise mechanism of advocacy specifically focused around them, that isn\u2019t directly connected to Marxism as well. Having both things is the best strategy to ensure they get solutions to the structural hurdles quickly, and one doesn\u2019t detract from the other.",

Those issues appeal to people who don't have any material analysis or class consciousness, as well as people who do. Those movements should be unique and distinct, and collect as many supporters as possible to further their goals. We don't need class consciousness to stop sending billions to Israel. We don't need class consciousness to let people use the bathroom they want to.\n2. Marxism inherently supports Palestinians and LGBT people, through their material needs. A Marxist formation would inherently be more supportive of LGBT people and Palestinians than the current formation, which is why there are many Palestinians and LGBT people in the ranks of Marxists. I am not advocating for pushing those people out, and I am still advocating that Marxists support those people with their material needs.\n3. I have no desire for any member of any ethnic or sexual orientation based group to downplay their membership. I was commenting on the poster saying \"primary demand\". The primary demand of Marxists should be to break the class hierarchy, not to become trans rights experts. These problems solve themselves in the result, so why not just have 2 forms of advocacy that take different approaches. Feel free to support them both, or just one if that makes more sense to you.\n4. Marxism is about workers rights. The class divide exists because of fundamental mistreatment of workers. Workers are the greatest single majority on Earth, and the source of any power that could create a classless society.",

Things like imperialism, colonialism, and yes social views are all connected to capitalism and class society.

Socialists should have a comprehensive platform for transforming society, base and superstructure. \n\nThe German Social Democratic Party back when it was still Marxist when Engels was in it stated this in their program and I think it still stand today:\n\n\u201cThe German Social Democratic Party therefore does not fight for new class privileges and class rights, but for the abolition of class rule and of classes themselves, for equal rights and equal obligations for all, without distinction of sex or birth. Starting from these views, it fights not only the exploitation and oppression of wage earners in society today, but every manner of exploitation and oppression, whether directed against a class, party, sex, or race.\u201d",

The reactionary attacks on transgender people by the bourgeois are a clear form of scapegoating under the pretence that gender expression undermines the traditional family and established gender roles. The nuclear family is a product of capitalism. It is the necessary model for reproducing the labour supply to make the ruling class rich, and a means of keeping women oppressed by supplying unpaid domestic labour. Because families are becoming increasingly unaffordable (thanks to capitalism), this model can only be imposed through more coercive and ideological means. So yes, it is vitally important to defend transpeople from discrimination and bigotry. The question of whether it has to be visible or whether representation matters depends on your goal and what audience you're trying to reach at that time. I think with the right-wing shift going on in the world, Marxists should be visible defending trans-rights because it's a fertile ground for radicalising people to organise against the system.",

We do need to stand up for the rights of oppressed and marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+, but not exclusively promote and give favoritism to those groups to the detriment of the whole working class.\n\nI made a post on this sub a while back, and it's clear that my opinion is not a popular point of view. But think about this: Lenin discussed with Clara Zetkin the issue of sex and marriage within the context of women's rights and communism. Lenin is quoted to have said:\n\n\"I was told that questions of sex and marriage are the main subjects dealt with in the reading and discussion evenings of women comrades. They are the chief subject of interest, of political instruction and education. I could scarcely believe my ears when I heard it. The first country of proletarian dictatorship surrounded by the counter-revolutionaries of the whole world, the situation in Germany itself requires the greatest possible concentration of all proletarian, revolutionary forces to defeat the ever-growing and ever-increasing counter-revolution. But working women comrades discuss sexual problems and the question of forms of marriage in the past, present and future. They think it their most important duty to enlighten proletarian women on these subjects . . . What a waste! . . . I mistrust those who are always contemplating the several questions, like the Indian saint his navel. It seems to me that these flourishing sexual theories which are mainly hypothetical, and often quite arbitrary hypotheses, arise from the personal need to justify personal abnormality or hypertrophy in sexual life before bourgeois morality, and to entreat its patience. This masked respect for bourgeois morality seems to me just as repulsive as poking about in sexual matters. However wild and revolutionary the behaviour may be, it is still really quite bourgeois. It is, mainly, a hobby of the intellectuals and of the sections nearest them. There is no place for it in the Party, in the class-conscious, fighting proletariat.\n\n. . . Even the wise Solomon said that everything has its time. I ask you: Is now the time to amuse proletarian women with discussions on how one loves and is loved, how one marries and is married? . . . Now all the thoughts of women comrades, of the women of the working people, must be directed towards the proletarian revolution. It creates the basis for a real renovation in marriage and sexual relations. At the moment other problems are more urgent than the marriage forms of Maoris or incest in olden times. The question of Soviets is still on the agenda for the German proletariat. The Versailles Treaty and its effect on the life of the working woman \u2013 unemployment, falling wages, taxes, and a great deal more. In short, I maintain that this kind of political, social education for proletarian women is false, quite, quite false.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the point Lenin was trying to make was that these sorts of things don't matter when it comes to the economic struggles that everyone faces. It's putting the cart before the horse. It could even be argued that the continued attention on what Lenin believed to be frivolous matters took away from efforts to attain the greatest possible concentration of all revolutionary proletarian forces, which then led to the failure to quell the uprising of the Nazis in Germany.  \n  \nI mean I think it's great that Tim Cook and his partner can get married, but can they hide behind being gay to distract from the fact that Apple uses child labor to manufacture iPhones? Can Sam Altman hide behind being gay to distract from the environmental damage that OpenAI and ChatGPT cause with its data processing centers? Does the feel-good fact that Caroline Farberger was able to successfully transition distract from the fact that ICA Insurance routinely denies justified insurance claims?  \n  \nIn my previous post, these were admittedly rhetorical questions that I asked which were different than the main question of my post, but still no one attempted to answer these questions: What good is the access to gender affirming care if people can't afford it? What good is the right to marriage when there's the ever present possibility of becoming homeless and food insecure? What good does it do for the LGBTQ+ community if big businesses are waving the pride flag during pride month if they are continually cutting wages and benefits to its employees?\n\nOnce the revolution happens and everyone gets a fair shake and can earn a dignified livelihood without being exploited, then it's appropriate to talk about how we can advance the rights of LGBTQ+.",

Is that even possible at this stage?\n\nI don't think most LGBTQIA+ people are buying the idea that because someone is also gay or trans that they are exempt from the crimes that any cist-gendered person would also face consequences for, they just aren't feeling the revolutionary fervor that we do as Communists maybe they could benefit from us sharing some of that with them.\n\nAdditionally, yes it is no good to attempt to affect these changes in a system that is about to disintegrate, depending on the severity of the coming upheaval in these next four years (for U.S peoples particularly) the system may totally collapse and then legislation that allowed for sexual transitions and same sex marriage will be moot and we will have to start from scratch again. \n\nI agree with V. Lenin in the quote you provided as per the fact that the total social restructuring that ensues after revolution will alter the entire social convention about marriage and gender norms. Although this is contrary to the Socialism at home before Socialism abroad doctrine of J. Stalin as the USSR later chose to roll back the revolutionary support for other nations. If you were to subscribe to that line of thought, then the question should be asked and affected as soon as any Communist nation is founded (barring internal issues like infrastructure or uprising.)\n\nAt the very least allowing for the conversation about these conditions will allow for it to have a platform after the fact so that the dialogue will continue to develop. And at the end of the day the degree in which people feel the need to discuss the concept is entirely up to them as individuals.",

But people in the imperial core and particularly people in settler states are pressured very unevenly. I think conditions still need to get worse before the labor aristocracy are ready to hear the message. Until then, we must fight for these super-exploited groups and I say this as a white settler, particularly for the independence of Indigenous and Black nations because IMO they have a better chance of creating counterpublics than crosscutting super-exploited groups which are born into and soaked in labor aristocracy values.

            "body": "Look into materialist feminism and social reproduction theory. There is a large amount of unwaged labor mystified as \"love\", \"religion\", \"charity\" and \"politeness\" which is necessary to the social reproduction of capitalism. The institution of the family most directly hurts women but it also hurts queer people and some other groups as well.\n\nIMO queerness is a kind of neurodivergence and disability. Aplatonic is a case where this stuff overlaps. Disability is a socio-economic construct rooted in non-standard and economically under-productive and under-reproductive bodies and behaviour under capitalism. Largely, disability forms a reserve pool of labor. The transition to a higher monopoly phase of capitalism is a mass disabling event, the development of so much technology tightens job requirements and creates a surplus of (neurodivergent) workers.\n\nQueerness is a similar construct rooted in unwaged labor necessary to the social reproduction of capitalism. To some extent, queer people serve as a super-exploited reserve pool of reproductive and sexual labor. Capitalism commodifies both certain kinds of labor and certain kinds of love.\n\nIt is not wrong to call queerness a disability. That just reveals that you are prejudiced against disability. The two are rooted in the same commodification of work, just one kind is waged and the other is unwaged.\n\nI have feelings that crosscutting forms of super-exploitation within the imperial core can be fit into a framework somewhat like that of imperialism. But domestic imperialism and how it might apply to crosscutting super-exploited groups is really confusing. I still need to read more on extractive abandonment and compradors and such.\n\nRegardless, Marxists must always push for the liberation of the super-exploited. The super-exploited within and without have always been a way for capitalists to co-opt revolutionary conditions with reaction and fascism. Personally, I think liberation in North America must begin with the independence of the Indigenous and Black nations. **IMO you simply cannot have a revolutionary party of labor aristocrats.** IMO this explains the popularity of anarchism in the imperial core somewhat. And declassed crosscutting marginalized groups such as white women, white queers and some immigrants are simply too difficult to organize effectively and just have a lot of propaganda to unlearn. IDK it's just really confusing if you're born into the labor aristocracy cult but don't really fit in. Organizing the imperial core confuses me. I do think specific declassed groups like mad people and substance users are where to start after the Indigenous and Black nations but it's just confusing.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the work in the academy is comprador/token bullshit of very limited use. And as I mentioned, the declassed are just very hard to organize. Labor aristocracy parties also have a lot of extremely annoying bullshit in North America.",

                    "body": "I am inclined to disagree with you as per your assertion of queerness as a disability. I have experience with individuals who have actual disabilities that require treatment for their subsequent complications (Paralysis, dismemberment, developmental, psychological and cognitive amongst others.) The only conceivable cognitive divergence from the nominally accepted functions of the human being is an attraction to the same sex or a lack of attraction to either which, causes no disruption to functional cognition, mobility, sensory, verbal functions or life fulfillment. That is unless you mean to imply that all humans Should be straight in a perfect world which is utterly your right to believe but again, I disagree. If it is implied that the LGBTQIA+ (which also includes natural born intersex peoples) are disabled then you also imply a treatment for that disability, for example the incredibly inhumane practice of conversion therapy (or forcibly performing surgery on the intersex). all together this borders on Semi-Nazism or a belief in the \u00dcbermensch specifically, some kind of unflawed human. At this point you may as well define being a human in any regard or capacity as being disabled because a more perfect form hypothetically exists somewhere.\n\n\\[Sidenote: Your assertion also assumes that Homosexuality, Asexuality or other sexual denominations cannot be adopted as a choice and rather that they are born that way which is something that has been inconclusive in the scientific realm thus far.\\]\n\nWhat I define as a disability is not rooted in the potential productivity of an individual but rather their ability to perform ADL's (activities of Daily Living) this includes using the restroom, showering, brushing teeth and more. There are also IADL's (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) which includes paying taxes, managing finances, using the telephone or writhing mail, shopping and preparing meals or arranging transportation from point A to point B. This is a part of the commonly accepted definitions of disability itself and in no way does gender queer, homosexuality or asexuality fall within these categories. You might consider this for intersex as it could be considered a birth defect that in some cases can cause health complications, yet for many people it does not. You may also argue that people who are LGBTQIA+ suffer from higher rates of depression and suicide. My response is that so long as people in society aren't trying to push them over the edge like is so often done, then there is a chance for them to accept themselves (without intervention) and love their life despite who they are. Thats something everybody has to do at some point straight or gay.\n\nIn this way I assert that it is wrong to call queerness a disability as it does not meet the requirements, I use to meet the definition of a disability.\n\nAlso, I denounce your statement that claims that to disagree with you would be evident of a prejudice against disability. This is an Ad hominem fallacy. In fact, it appears that you are expressing a prejudice against queerness and trying to mask it by gaslighting the reader to fear being labeled as prejudiced by you.",

I don't want to assume that you are just having a grand ol' time in life or anything but this begs the question of hypocrisy and even the genuine nature of all Marxist philosophers from the man himself to Mao. This is not to imply that the brain trust of Communists could stand on their own, in fact it is true that all groups of the marginalized and exploited must unite and rise against the oppressors or the movement will never succeed. Yet without those thinkers the framework which we apply as students of Marxism would not exist and Communism would have never existed either. \n\nIn my experience it is very straightforward that even the petty bourgeois have an enemy in the Bourgeois and aristocracy. I myself might be what you consider de-classed and yet I feel that I am just as much a proletarian as any of the lower class. I too am asked to commodify my labor and put it out to market in order to earn a wage instead of being able to train as a specialist and be guaranteed work that not only fulfils the need for my skills but that also suits my talents and that I love. Once more as per my experience, I have no problem organizing based on those terms alone.\n\n What really stands in the way of most people who are parts of those groups is a whole slough of factors from Identity politics to the Bourgeois thinking and habits that disorient the working class.\n\nIt is difficult to respond to each of your points as you get a little bit all over the place especially in 6th paragraph where you jump from topic to topic based on some very loose connections and some spots where I don't comprehend what you're saying. Still, I mainly take away that the liberation of ethnic minorities through secession here in the North American sphere is in your opinion the most pressing endeavor. \n\nI argue that this is valid, at least for Native American populations (as much as they have an actual justification to do so) as for the \"black nations\" in North America I cannot understand what you mean. Any nationality based on ethnic exclusivism is going to be Anti-social by nature. They will sustain the classist division of people and simply fill the shoes of the previous oppressor. Additionally, even if African people were brought here as slaves, they were also a part of the colonial force which integrated itself and its slave labor economy into the world of the Native Americans then eradicated their way of life. If we were to support the inherently sectarian ideology of independent ethnic nations on the North American continent we may as well demand that all White, Latino, Black and Asian people move back to where their ancestors came from. \n\nSo, I disagree that this course of action is actually practical or morally good for that matter. I will say that regardless of the admittedly superficial divisions between all members of the proletarian class all peoples deserve to be treated with respect and allowed to make the choices they feel are right for their lives and not for the perceived good of the system (barring things we all agree are wrong such as rape, murder, child abuse, etc..)\n\nIf you read all that please do respond because there are likely some things I missed or may have misinterpreted from your statement. Either way that is how I received it.",
