    "selftext": "Hi, good evening!\n\n(As a disclaimer, please understand that my question is in good faith and more product of haphazard academic curiosity than conviction of anything proposed or cited here).\n\nI would like to clarify what I mean. I'm not strictly talking \"pro-capitalist\" in a normative sense, as it's seems many marxists actually are not opposed to a social democratic/left-liberal reformist capitalist system and, in another sense, Marx and every marxist is a pro-capitalist as a means to deepen the internal contradictions of capitalism, reach revolution and overcome it.\n\nI would instead like to know if anyone has already compared the concepts and models of competition in orthodox economics to dialectical materialism and/or defended capitalism on the basis that increasing competition (and thus deepening the contradictions and dialectics) is actually good and leads to a better and more efficient society.\n\nThat of course rejects much of the political project of marxism and probably would be considered by many to be an analysis on the right, but maybe the author could still feel he was being true and faithful to marxist tradition (as analytical marxists who use orthodox economics in their analysis do, for example).\n\nThere seems to be actually (from what I've heard) stuff done with this exact idea in mind especially in the work of Nick Land and similar authors...but it doesn't seem very formal and serious work, sometimes mixed with fiction (in true Ayn Rand fashion) and much more right wing, obscurantist, pessimistic and outright fasc\\*\\*\\* than I would ever be willing to waste my time reading (I hear Evola is a reference...I mean...). Of course, you may disagree, and if so please argue for why I should give it a try in the comments, I maybe can change my mind, but that's my view at the moment...\n\nAs an alternative question, did someone try to make \"right wing pro-capitalist marxism/dialectics\" other than NIck and, well, fasc...? (especially authors closer to orthodox economics, such as analytical marxists)\n\nI appreciate any engagement and wish everyone a great weekend :))",

See \"Critique of the Gotha Program\". The Gotha Program is essentially repeated today to a significant extent in the programs of social democratic and left-liberal parties, which leads to society moving away from socialism, strengthening bourgeois states and weakening worker cooperatives independent of the bourgeois state.\n\nOf course, self-proclaimed Marxists are not obliged to consider this paragraph to be the key point of all Marxism (many Marxists actually do and are more likely to reject other statements of Marx than this one), but objectively this was Marx's point of view.",

Or if any DM theorists are pro markets?\u00a0\n\n\nThere might be some who have done that but one thing I've seen is that almost no capitalist economist actually takes the time to understand dialectical materialism and so\u00a0their \"debunks\" of Marx can usually be shown to be a strawman of what Marxists actually think. \"Efficiency\" is just a myth that's used to ad hoc justify the system that exists, there's nothing efficient about capitalism or competition because it forces people to keep producing goods that no one needs in order to bring a competitive advantage to one firm over the needs of society. I'm pretty sure guys like Yanis Varoufakis believe in something like market efficiency but I'm not certain where he lands politically.\n\n\n\nThere are some Market Marxists but they aren't \"free market\" and they're more concerned with worker rights than efficiency in the markets, they just see markets as something that actually works. Think China where they still have markets but also consider themselves socialist.",

Thus, also not someone who would want to \"refute\" DM, as it's not a matter of refuting, I want good faith arguments, more like reinterpreting it, like Analytical Marxists have done.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't see how it would not be possible for someone to put forth an argument like this (that dialectics will not lead to abolition of private property but more competition and that would be desirable, that \"capitalism was socialism all along, our society transformed so gradually we didn't even see it\") and still consider themselves socialists and marxists (even if, with my current opinion, I would say they seem to be more on the right and pro-capitalist camp). Of course you and I may disagree with him and some may even find that to be completely irrational, but that could happen and, if it is in good faith, I think such an opinion would deserve to be heard, that is not unlikely something could be harnessed from this discussion. That's how academia works.\u00a0\n\n\nYour second paragraph put part of my point better than I ever could: critiques of Marxism from outside Marxism tend to be hilariously bad and out-of-touch, when not outright ideological and in bad faith. I wanted to see if there was an exception, actual good faith, informed constructive criticism, I can't believe for my life such a thing was never even attempted...\n\n\nRegarding my use of \"efficiency\", it was just to exemplify what could potentially be said in such an argument, I agree it was not greatly phrased...",

            "body": "I can\u2019t think of such a case of a right wing Marxist thinkers other than debates over specific issues like Trotsky vs Stalin over permanent revolution and socialism in one country.\n\nI assume a difficulty is that the dialectical method found in Hegel was his revolutionary side, emphasizing that everything is rational for a time and place but becomes obsolete as things change. That there is no perfect system, and this was part of a critique of the theologically dominant view of the immutable quality of the natural world as a creation of God until science found evidence of change in nature.\n\nHegel then had his conservative side in his system where he seems to posit having reached the absolute idea and self conscious knowledge, and the position that everything that is rational is real may be emphasized in defense of the status quo in a one side way. But only Fukuyama attempted to position capitalism as being the End of History and that was the based in part on the hubris at the end of the cold war and the hegemony of the US.\n\nWhat I think occurs more often is the extraction of insights from Marxist thinkers or Marxist sympathizers in understanding capitalism. They do not take it on the whole but parts.\nI see a lot of criticisms of the Monthly School like positing that perfect competition actually existed in earlier states of capitalism, that it adopts a more economist method of abstraction than an analysis for revolutionary avenues of the working class in class struggle due to this. That many modern economists read some of Marx and even Marxists replicate ideas entirely compatible with reformist tendencies despite the connotation of Marx as a revolutionary.",

                            "body": "Not Marxist school but Monthly Review associated with Sweezy.\nBasically, they emphasize the economic categories too abstracted from the social relations and world of people. It becomes so abstract like neoclassical economists that one loses sight of what underpins these forms. When concepts are treated to abstracted from the condition in which they exist, then the categories can end up fetishized as abstract truths. But following Hegel, truth is always concrete. And Marx critique was in large part showing the social basis of such categories. Although h value-form theorists in some cases may overstate the social to the detriment of the economic categories Marx was analyzing also.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm\n\u201cIn his Theory, when Sweezy turns to Luxemburg and the others I have mentioned, he evaluates their theory and criticizes it in its own terms. He presents the mathematics of the reproduction schemes and in good economic form sets out mathematically precise equilibrium conditions. In the case of Otto Bauer\u2019s work, Sweezy explicitly translates it into the form of a mathematical growth model. His evaluation of their work only involves questioning either their assumptions or details of their reasoning, never the general framework of a purely economic approach. As with most economists, accumulation for Sweezy is the accumulation of capital narrowly defined in terms of growing amounts of money, means of production, mobilized labor, and commodities. It is for this reason he can work with the language and forms acceptable to Leontief or Harrod-Domar.\n\nWhen Sweezy turns to Marx\u2019s \u201claw of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall,\u201d he interprets it in a very typical economic fashion. By this I mean he assumes that the theory concerns forces acting on the actual monetary rate of profit. Secondly, when he uses the \u201cvalue\u201d categories of variable capital (v), constant capital (c), surplus value (s), the rate of exploitation (s/v), and the organic composition of capital (c/v), he treats them exactly the way an economist would treat any variables: as mathematical quantities to be manipulated formalistically. Thus he notes that if the numerator and denominator of the rate of profit s/(c+v) are both divided by v, we obtain (s/v)/[c/v)+ 1]. This he likes because the rate of profit is now expressed in terms of the two categories that Marx is concerned with: the rate of exploitation and the organic composition of capital. On the basis of this expression he argues that the \u201claw,\u201d is indeterminant because although c/v might rise faster than s/v, as c is substituted for v, we cannot be sure a priori because the rising productivity that accompanies the investment in constant capital lowers the value of c as well as that of v, and there is no way to predict which will fall most. Voila! So much for the \u201claw\u201d Marx called the most fundamental and important law of capitalist development.\n\nAs a result of Sweezy\u2019s argument there has been an almost endless flow of articles attacking or defending him on this subject. Among those Marxists most prominent in the attack have been Paul Mattick (1969b), Mario Cogoy (1973), and David Yaffe (1972), who have all defended the centrality and validity of the law. Most of these critiques have included an attempt to restate the law in a different mathematical form in order to recuperate it. Defenses of Sweezy\u2019s rejection have also been forthcoming from the man himself \u2014repeatedly in the postwar period\u2014 and from others on either theoretical (Roemer, 1978; 1979; 1981) or empirical (Weiskopf, 1979) grounds.\nAnd what are the essential points of the debate among all these Marxists? Are they political points? Hardly, they are not even political economic points. They are mainly mathematical and formalistic. In his summary of the debate Herb Gintis, writing in OIlman and Vernoff\u2019s (1982) book, says \u201cin general American Marxists have carefully scrutinized the mathematical theory on which the falling-rate-of-profit prediction is based, and have concluded that there is no such tendency.\u201d\nWhat are we to say about this kind of Marxism? Certainly the similarity of the debate to the mainstream discussion on the same subject is striking.[14] If this is Marxian economics, then clearly the emphasis is on economics, not Marx. What we have here is a sanitized, seminar-room Marxism that has been stripped of its political content and class anger. This is a Marxism mainstream economists can understand and evaluate in their own terms. If more economists of this Marxian I. stripe are not getting tenure it can only be because either the mainstream judges f their work to be unproductive or because, like Rosa Luxemburg, their political actions in other areas are more militant than their theory.\nThe last aspect of Sweezy\u2019s work that I want to examine, and one which has also generated a whole wing of contemporary Marxist crisis theory, is his interpretation of Marx\u2019s comments on the limits to working-class consumption. Sweezy\u2019s positive view of Marx\u2019s comments fit easily with a Hansenian interpretation of Keynes on inadequate aggregate demand and the views of both Hansen (1938; 1941) and Steindl (1952) on capitalism\u2019s tendencies toward stagnation.\nThis interpretation of Marx as an underconsumptionist is again very much within the tradition of economics. From Malthus, whom Marx studied, through Hobson in the underground, to Keynes at the center of mainstream thought, the issue of the adequacy of demand to sustain and induce growth in output has been a central subject of debate. But, where Marx studied capitalist attempts to limit working-class income and working-class demands for ever higher income (as well as less work) as one important class contradiction in the system, Sweezy finds a justification for embracing a pessimistic Keynesianism in which it is the weakness of the working class that leads to crisis. So preoccupied is Sweezy with studying the similarities and differences between Marx and Keynes that he included as an appendix to his book an essay by Tsuru that explicitly maps Marxian and Keynesian aggregate macro categories onto each other.\u201d",

I thought more on the lines of a defence of unsolved contradictions (in the form of market competition as a form of deepening them, the dialectics), be that they are desirable or inevitable; or that the resolving of capitalism contradictions will not lead to abolition of private property, socialism and communism but actually more capitalism and a more competitive one.\u00a0\n\n\nIn a way, my curiosity was seeing more of a \"right wing\"/pro-capitalist critique of Marxism inside the own marxist framework.
