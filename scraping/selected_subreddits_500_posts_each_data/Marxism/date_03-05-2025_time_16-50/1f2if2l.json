The jobs now available, in the US especially, put workers in a position where they are part of the state apparatus in some sense and therefore their class interests are more closely aligned with the state rather than the rest of the proletariat.\n\nIs there any truth to this? Does the PMC deserve its own analysis, either as it's own class or as a subset of the working class?",

It's about the tendencies that give rise to class struggle.\n\nThe classes of the bourgeoisie and proletariat under capitalism are reproduced by the twin premises of private ownership of the means of production, and workers who sell their labour-power to its owners.\n\nWhat and who gets termed \"the professional-managerial class\" varies widely which raises questions up front as to whether it's an analytically useful concept.\n\nIn one usage it can refer to people like registered doctors, or other workers who take a specific state-regulated role in social reproduction.\n\nIn another usage it refers to the organisation of workforces into hierarchies, which is in effect a technology of production.\n\nIn my experience the term \"professional-managerial class\" is rarely very precisely defined when it is used. It usually appears as a floating signifier that names an enemy. The truth is that the \"professional-managerial class\" is never a social formation as necessary to the capitalist order as are proletariat and bourgeoisie. \"Class fraction\" may be a better term for it.\n\nA \"professional-managerial class\" can also be viewed as just one of many ways the stratification and separation of workers reproduces the domination of capital. \n\nPerhaps because of these factors, I find the \"PMC discourse\" often directs its critiques ambiguously. These critiques fall surprisingly rarely on actual managers in corporations.\n\nThe \"PMC discourse\" also tends to skirt or de-emphasise accounts of other defining strata among workers today, such as those produced by national borders, visas, landlordism, etc.",

            "body": "The genesis of the professional managerial workers is connected to the change of competitive (personal) capitalism to monopoly capitalism (a more institutional form) which took place between 1870-1930. Ordinary labor discipline within the firm was maintained through the personal command of the owner/entrepreneur and sometimes this authority was delegated to the foreman. But as firm size grew this became unsustainable. Delegated disciplinary authority was abused by the foreman; struggles broke out between labor and capital for the allegiance of the foreman. With increasing capital-labor conflict the capitalist controlled state and other capital backed civil society groups brought in to intermediate.\n\nDuring this period the size of the firm (no of workers or amount of product) grew too. Thus bringing under one roof a number of workers. As economies of scales appeared, volume produced per unit time was the main criteria, thus creating what Alfred chandler called economies of speed. This meant routinising the work performed by production workers through sub dividing, automation (capital deepening) and taking planning away from the shop floor and performing it ex ante in the office; the sort of strategies Braverman talked about in his book.\n\nTherefore the need for two new use values was created: i) management and control of the labor force and ii) ex ante scientific planning and development of the product. Like any other use value in a capitalist society this was organized through wage labor. At the same time there was a huge increase in state sector. This created the professional managerial workers. The control over the PM workers was instituted through internal labor markets and reputation. The original production workers through some success had forced capital into institutionalizing the capital labor conflict through the state (NLRA). Other workers was pushed into what is called secondary labor market. From the 80s onwards the same process of subdividing, routinising, automation (robots, expert systems and now AI) was used to destroy the primary or internal labor market making large portion of the PM workers precarious.\n\nNow are they a class? I would say No. They are not a class in itself, for their authority is delegated; they do not have teh basis to control the state (exceptions may be doctors and AMA). They also do not seem to be a class for itself, always bickering and pushing each other under the bus.\n\nI would suggest you read the following books:\n\nAlfred Chandler Scale vs Scope, Braverman Labor and Monopoly Capital, Edwards Contested Terrain, Clawson Bureaucracy and the labor process, Edwards, Reich, Gordon Segmented work Divided workers and Van Elternen Managerial Control of American workers. Depending on your interest there is much more to read.",

For instance, the wages of meta-productive workers will often increase as profit declines, because declining profit means a greater urgency of reinvestment by capital owners in improved productivity.",

            "body": "In Marxist theory, a class is defined primarily by its relationship to the means of production. Marx and Engels famously wrote in *The Communist Manifesto*:\n\n> \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\"\n\nClasses are determined by their role in the economic structure of society, particularly how they relate to the production process and the ownership of the means of production. Marx, in *Capital*, describes the proletariat as those who must sell their labor power to survive because they do not own the means of production:\n\n> \"The maintenance and reproduction of the working class is, and must ever be, a necessary condition to the reproduction of capital. But the capitalist may safely leave its fulfilment to the labourer\u2019s instincts of self-preservation and of propagation\" (*Capital*, Vol. I, Ch. 23).\n\nThis quote clearly shows that the working class\u2014those who sell their labor power\u2014are essential to the functioning of capitalism, but they are also the class that suffers exploitation under the capitalist system.\n\nThe idea of a \"Professional Managerial Class\" (PMC) suggests a group of people who, due to their education, technical skills, or managerial roles, occupy a position that is somehow distinct from the proletariat. However, this concept does not align with Marxist class analysis. \n\nMarx explained that even within the working class, there are differences in status and function, but these do not create a new class. For instance, in *Capital*, Marx discusses how certain laborers might be better paid or have more responsibilities, but they are still wage laborers, subject to the same exploitation as any other worker:\n\n> \"The nature of the work demands that it be done in cooperation with others, but every particular task makes each individual an appendage to the general machine\" (*Capital*, Vol. I, Ch. 15).\n\nThis statement underscores that, regardless of the complexity or technical nature of the work, those who do not own the means of production are fundamentally workers.\n\nThe argument that the PMC has different class interests due to their roles in the state apparatus or financialized economy must also be scrutinized. Marx addressed the role of the state in capitalist society, stating:\n\n> \"The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie\" (*The Communist Manifesto*).\n\nThose who work within the state apparatus are not a separate class but are part of the machinery that serves the interests of the bourgeoisie. They may hold positions of power or influence, but unless they own capital, they do not form a new class.\n\nFinancialization, or the increased dominance of financial capital, changes the landscape of capitalism but does not alter the fundamental class relations. Marx noted the power of finance capital and its effects on the economy, but he always maintained that class distinctions are rooted in ownership of the means of production, not in specific economic roles:\n\n> \"The credit system appears as the main lever of overproduction and overspeculation in commerce solely because the reproduction process, which is elastic by nature, is here forced to its extreme limits\" (*Capital*, Vol. III, Ch. 30).\n\nHere, Marx critiques how finance capital exacerbates the contradictions of capitalism, but he does not suggest that those working in finance or management form a separate class.\n\nGiven this analysis, the so-called PMC is better understood as a stratum within the proletariat rather than a separate class. They might have different roles or higher wages, but they are still wage laborers. Their interests, in the end, align with those of the broader working class because they do not own the means of production.\n\nIn fact, Marx and Engels were clear about the dangers of trying to divide the working class. In *The Communist Manifesto*, they warned against allowing the proletariat to be split by differences in occupation or status:\n\n> \"The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilized ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.\"\n\nThis passage emphasizes that while the bourgeoisie tries to divide the proletariat, these divisions are superficial compared to the fundamental class antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe idea of the PMC as a distinct class is not supported by Marxist theory. Instead, this group should be viewed as part of the proletariat, albeit with distinct roles that might lead to different ideological leanings. However, their ultimate interests align with those of all workers in the struggle against capitalist exploitation. \n\nThe proletariat must remain united in its struggle, resisting attempts to divide it into separate classes or factions. As Marx and Engels stressed, the unity of the working class is paramount in the fight against capitalism and in the pursuit of socialism.",

Labor aristocracy are workers whose position of relative power enables them to demand good working conditions, e.g. automotive workers in Germany AND some members of the PMC, such as engineers of all kinds. \n\nAs Hegel wrote \"The Owl of Minerva only takes flight at dawn\", so any analysis that claims to be dialectical has to be reapplied to changed material circumstances and can only claim temporary validity. \n\nThis is especially the case for the role of intellectual and administrative work in the contemporary production process. The category of PMC is more a recognition of the fact that intellectual labor/white collar workers in general have a tendency to align more with capital than the blue collar workers and is a contemporary analysis of the category of Brain Work. The category of PMC also recognizes the tendency of white collar workers to take the lead in workers struggles and institutions using the skills they acquired through their work and to transform labor institutions into forms of monopolized labour power, effectively becoming capitalists of labor themselves, or otherwise climb the ladder of capitalism for personal gain.",

Once you've answered that, then you can ask yourself whether the theory of the PMC helps you in that regard or doesn't. So in some ways, you've had to ask the wrong question to get at the right one.",
