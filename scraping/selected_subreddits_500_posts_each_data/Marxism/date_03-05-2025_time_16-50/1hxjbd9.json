    "selftext": "I jotted down a quote by Etienne Balibar, in which he says that the concept of 'the nation' is \u201cpredicated upon \u201cexclusions and dominations\u201d, and is intimately interwoven with racisms and imperialisms, regardless of how \u2018progressive\u2019 a state might like to present its nations to be.\u201d I think, from my poorly written notes, it was on page 49 of a text - but I have managed to omit the title, year, or where it was published. I'd be exceptionally grateful if anyone can help! ",
