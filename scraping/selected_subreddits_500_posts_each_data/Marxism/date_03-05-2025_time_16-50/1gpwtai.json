    "selftext": "Obviously capitalists don't want all undocumented immigrants to be deported from the US, since it would result in a massive labor shortage as well as a massive increase in the power of the workers who remain. My guess was that Trump would use the threat of workplace raids to make capitalists who rely on undocumented workers stay on his good side, but that for the most part he wouldn't deport anyone unless their boss angers him. \n\nBut then this Tom Homan ogre suggested that undocumented immigrants should start self-deporting to save themselves the misery of getting thrown out. I'm guessing this suggestion will actually result in people leaving the US and disadvantaging the capitalists who exploit their labor, but maybe not enough to produce any systemic consequences. \n\nIt's hard for me to believe that Trump would ever intentionally inflict indiscriminate damage on the capitalist class at all, and certainly not by deporting their most easily-exploited workers. I imagined that he'd do an occasional spectacular primetime raid on an enemy's business to amuse his fanatics, while for the most part maintaining the status quo. But Tom Homan says undocumented immigrants should leave now so he doesn't have to deport them later. Maybe they'll really try to deport all undocumented workers, regardless of capitalist interests? \n\nI'm curious about your reading on this.",

That ruined a bunch of lives over a decade or so and abused a bunch of people and in terms of the greater economy didn\u2019t do much since while deporting people they were also running the bracero program and bringing in tens and hundreds of thousands of temporary workers from Mexico.\n\nTrump cited this plan in 2016 and again this campagin. He also met with agriculture and industry groups in 2016 to promise them all the guest workers from south of the border they need. These immigrant-dependent industry groups all backed Trump in 2016\n\nSo rather than hurting the capitalists, it has no effect on capitalists in general and for the capitalists who use immigrant labor it doesn\u2019t matter because the government will bring them the migrant labor.\n\nIt\u2019s to control workers directly and it is also more broadly sort of nationalistic theater. Rather than fix the economy he will throw people under the bus and that will make it better for the \u201ctrue\u201d people and make it seem like he is doing something for people.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1950s I think it was more purely about controlling labor pools during the depression and after WWII. But both required a lot of racism to sell to the public and involved racist attacks.\n\nThis is the logic of fascist or right-populist nationalism\u2026 there is an other and we are the same despite class differences because of that.

Think of how americans can enjoy produce like bananas year round at dirt cheap prices because workers in Honduras are paid next to nothing to grow those bananas.\n\nThe border is necessary to maintain this global apartheid.  This apartheid helps the ruling class because it allows the ruling class to \"buy off\" first world workers who pose more of a threat to the ruling class because they live in the same country as the ruling class.  But it also allows the ruling class to continue to have a large population of hyper exploited workers too.\n\nSome capitalists import the global south workers to the imperialist core, either by hiring illegal immigrants or by hiring immigrants whose immigration status is tightly regulated and precarious.  \n\nBut for the system to work, illegal immigrants must be limited in number and must live in a constant fear of getting deported.  Which means that large numbers of immigrants must be deported on a regular basis.\n\nThis system makes immigrant workers, legal and illegal, extremely easy to exploit and extremely vulnerable.  It basically gives their bosses near total control over their lives.  These workers are too scared to unionize or report labor violations for fear it could lead to loss of legal immigration status or deportation.\n\nSo no, trump isn't planning to deport ALL illegal immigrants, but, as the leader of the capitalist state, he has to make sure the capitalist state fulfils the purpose for which it was created - to use violent force against the working class in order to maintain the supremacy over the working class both at home and abroad.  This means getting tough on the border, maintaining the system of global apartheid, protecting the privileged status of American workers, and keeping immigrant workers in a state of being hyper exploitable.  Which means mass deportation, not all immigrants, but a damn good number of them.\n\nAnd it's doubly important to point out that trump isn't unusually or uniquely cruel in this regard.  Democrat presidents such as Biden and Obama also mass deport illegal immigrants just as cruelty and viciously.  You can argue that maybe Obama had a small sliver of mercy on him when he created the \"dreamers\" program, but it was a small sliver of mercy indeed since he was also known as the \"deporter in chief.\"",

Bourgeois nationalism is a tool against class struggle to call for national unity against outsiders. The problem is of course, fewer migrants means a reducing surplus workforce which means a more powerful bargaining position for the proletariat, and whilst this doesn't necessarily result in better wages for them, or forcing bourgeois powers to pay better, it gives them one less avenue through which to squeeze workers' pay. But if they don't pursue this nationalism, they also have one less avenue for driving a wedge between workers.\n\nHence, a contradiction (one of many) in capitalism. \n\nSo what will the result be? Assuming for a moment that he will actually carry this out, and it's not exactly likely it will happen to the extent they threaten (although no doubt many will be deported), the threats they face from workers unity will probably not be consciousness of bargaining power for a while, it will at first mostly be focused on the tearing apart of families. I would be surprised if the benefit to workers in the form of a reduced workforce actually produces conditions ripe enough to be worth harvesting by the end of the Trump administration, frankly, because I just don't think enough people would be deported quickly enough to have any noticeable impact.",

Just looking at demographics proves this to be laughable. Plenty of non white demographics like Latin American people, (many of them once or still hyper exploited immigrant labour) and even indigenous Native American people voted for Trump over Harris. \n\nFirst and foremost you have to centre class. Settlers is an abandonment of class politics through the lens of dialectic and historical materialism for a moral-based, feelings driven way of understanding politics. Describing white workers as all benefiting from imperialist spoils and as well as being settlers engaged in a settler project is just not accurate. Workers in America are poor as fuck and continuously have their rights and living standards eroded through ongoing class warfare by the American bourgeoisie. If any of the imperialist spoils were being passed down, it would be a qualitatively insignificant amount that would not shape workers class position and consciousness (last study I saw considered it to be 1-5%). Only a very small minority of middle class professionals who actually manage these projects ever receive any benefit. An actual explanation for US living standards is the level of development of the US itself. Not to mention that US workers are not engaged in an ongoing settler project. They have no choice in the matter of structural indigenous oppression and are not involved in ongoing land seizure as a way of materially gaining (as opposed to say 150 years ago or in Israel currently). The US is much more accurately described as a post colonial capitalist economy, emphasising colonialism over capitalism is a disastrous mis-orientation. It\u2019s also inaccurately describes racial politics in America. Plenty of people from oppressed minority groups in America can back the democrat establishment or vote for trump as a worker or be a ruling class capitalist figure. These people are not settlers I think we can both agree but using the same standard white workers are not either. \nWhite supremacy and whiteness is not a convincing argument for arguing that the proletariat as a whole are bought off. Arguing some oppressed second generation migrant who cleans toilets for $8 an hour and can barely afford rent or food and can\u2019t afford healthcare is doing it for the spoils of colonialism and imperialism and to maintain white supremacy is absurd. \n\nYou should read what marx actually wrote about America or any other colonial project. He would strongly disagree with the concept of Settlers - and this was back when the US was still actually engaged in settler colonialism! \n\nTrump was elected based on primarily the economy and perceived quality of life reductions under Biden. All of the polling shows that in every demographic group this was the number one concern, particularly for working class people. Kamala was from Biden\u2019s government and was committing to the same deeply unpopular program that had nothing to offer working class people. So no one voted for her but the core democrat base, a shit tonne of democrat voters just stayed at home. Polling also indicates that a lot of people voted for trump despite not really agreeing with any of his policies, largely out of desperation because a shit tonne of workers are miserable and the petit bourgeoise are having their position threatened by economic hardship. People often went to the ballot and voted on anything but the presidential race. Settlers is completely incapable of providing suitable explanatory power with which to actually understand why this happened. Workers can actually just be reactionary at times when the state of society is reactionary. If the right is given room to offer an explanation for oppression then that\u2019s the argument that will take hold particularly when people are suffering. \n\nNot to mention the weird and racist blind spot it has for \u201cnon white\u201d colonial establishments. It mentions Liberia once for example, is soft on countries with a very similar history to the US like Mexico and other Central and South American colonial countries for god knows what reason (probably third world campism) or even just ignorance of these countries. \n\nWhat is the end point for Sakai\u2019s settler politics? It\u2019s certainly not class struggle. If the working class is bought off there is no basis for solidarity with them to fight oppression. It\u2019s basically an excuse to let capitalists off the hook by not organising domestically and just rely on third world proletariats to do the heavy lifting for us. It\u2019s moral demonising as opposed to material class politics dressed up in a smokescreen of Marxism. It\u2019s liberalism.",

Why spend so much time trying to understand those who want to exterminate large swaths of the working class rather than instead working to better understand the swaths being targeted? Settlers would not be popular if the ideas were useless, it has no institutional support.",

Sakai however just relies on emotion and not evidence to support what he says. \n\nYou\u2019re racially essentialising people of colour.  There\u2019s plenty of indigenous or black or otherwise people of colour leftists that disagree with him. I know because I\u2019m in an organised org with them. Identity politics leads to absurd statements like this. \n\nYour \u201cfact\u201d is literally not true, the communist party of Australia and the radical leftist trade unions fought for indigenous rights alongside indigenous aboriginal Australians here. The Gurindji strike is a famous multi year long strike where largely white workers in unions supported the Gurindji people\u2019s strike for self determination and land back. Including solidarity strikes, dues collections, intervention by communist party activists to provide legal support, someone to correspond with letters, propaganda support making sure all of Australia knew of the strike and why. Even went as far as strikes in the UK to support them! \n\nSettlers has tonnes of support in intellectual circles and moderate social democratic trade Union bureaucracy circles. Largely arguing why white people shouldn\u2019t ever do anything radical because they\u2019re racist colonisers by the nature of their birth and skin colour. \n\nDo you think Black African migrant who came to Australia is a settler? That\u2019s what people who agree with Sakai think. It meant they turned on black African students trying to organise a Black Lives Matter rally against the racism they experienced while being witch hunted by the Australian state. Absurd",

The fact that the us (and Europe) are by comparison so tepid I think proves their really desperate dependence on migrants and makes clear the real reasons and consequences of migration in these countries.

It's not going to do anything substantial to the Capitalists, because low wages isn't the only way of taking surplus value. The key factor is the Rate of Exploitation, which they can just alter on the price end.\n\nEmployment numbers are also pretty dreadful, so there's going to be plenty of desperate Americans to fill those jobs once we really start getting into this new depression. \n\n\n\nIts not going to make or break any working class political movement, because it's 4% of the population we're talking about. Immigration politics isn't *Mass* politics.\n\n\n\nWhatever school ends up producing the US Vanguard Party probably isn't going to pay it more than 4% of the population's worth of attention. Not because it's doesn't contain class elements, or because it doesn't matter, but because it's not the first task at hand for building the Revolution. Mobilizing the masses against Imperialism is the first and chief task in our current era, and the reality of the matter is that most people *will not* notice any kind of difference regardless of how it plays out.",
