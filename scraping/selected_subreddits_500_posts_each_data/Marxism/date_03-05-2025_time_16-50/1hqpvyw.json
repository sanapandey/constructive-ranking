    "selftext": "Ok I want to make sure I have a decent grasp of capitalist crises according to marx.\n\nIn essence, competition tends to lead to capitalists to invest in constant capital (i.e. machinery) which increases labor productivity and therefore relative surplus value. If labor is more productive, you can squeeze out more surplus value in a day.\n\nThe rate of profit itself is defined as s/(c+v) where s = surplus value c = constant capital and v = variable capital.\n\nOver time, c/v increases because higher labor productivity means a higher relative surplus value.\n\nWe can take the above ROP equation and divide by v\n\n(s/v)/(c/v+1)\n\nSo here we have the rate of surplus value divided by the organic composition of capital + 1\n\nAs c/v increases, s increases and v decreases, however it decreases at a slower rate than c/v because there's only so much absolute surplus value for any increase in relative surplus value.\n\nThis means that, over time, there is a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, as s/v grows slower than c/v+1\n\nWhy is this bad for capitalism? After all, so long as the ROP > 0 isn't it still rational to invest?\n\nThat may be true, but there's the question of risk tolerance. Not all investments pan out. And as the rate of profit falls, it becomes harder and harder to overcome risk tolerance as the reward for risk is much lower than before.\n\nInstead the money that would go to investment is held onto for better times, or invested in speculative bubbles, or simply spent on consumption.\n\nBasically a lower rate of profit lowers the overall amount of investment because there is a reduced incentive to invest relative to other activities.\n\nAnyways, this means that the total mass of investment shrinks for the economy.\n\nThis is a problem because at this very moment more investment is needed in the economy. Why?\n\nWell because as constant capital expands, so does the volume of commodities produced, after all labor productivity is enhanced. This means that the same quantity of labor produces a greater mass of commodities.\n\nConstant capital has with it associated costs, maintenance, potentially debt and various forms of overhead, etc. But the market itself only can absorb so much at a given price level. So as constant capital expands, so does the volume of commodities produced, potentially beyond the point of market saturation. Should that occur, then this constant capital cannot run at full capacity. And if that happens the cost relative to profit increases.\n\nThe only way to deal with this is further accumulation which further enhances labor productivity, thereby producing a greater quantity of commodities at a lower price. Since the price is lower the market can absorb more. And, importantly, further accumulation increases relative surplus value, thereby increasing s/v which can offset the lower rate of profit. And that matters because it means that your cost/profit ratio falls, and that can keep you in business. But that only matters if that surplus value can be realized, and that can only happen if the market can absorb the commodities produced at that price, hence me mentioning the lower price overcoming saturation.\n\nBut eventually you're right back where you started and you need more investment.\n\nBut if the mass of investment is shrinking, then you cannot further accumulate, meaning that currently existing capital is rendered unprofitable, which then drives businesses under as their costs are too great relative to their\n\nincome. Not only that, but employment takes a hit, because less labor is needed for a given quantity of commodities, which further exacerbates the crisis by reducing demand and thereby the quantity demanded at a given price.\n\nSo basically, there are two things happening at once.\n\n1. Accumulation drives up the amount of constant capital, thereby enhancing relative surplus value but also the sheer mass of commodities produced.\n2. That same accumulation drives down the rate of profit. That lower rate of profit then hurts further accumulation as investment shrinks, which then means that previously accumulated capital is rendered unprofitable\n\nbecause the cost/profit ratio rises and thereby drives them out of business.\n\nIn essence, the lower rate of profit slows accumulation, which creates a crisis because that accumulation is needed to keep previous accumulation profitable.\n\nIs all of this correct? Anything I missed?",

            "body": "I think what is missing from your analysis is the issue of increase/decrease in the OVERALL mass of surplus value extracted from the working class, not just the shift in its rate.  \"Competition\" is the form through which the allocation of that surplus value across the economy occurs.  Monopolies and cartels (i.e. LESS competition) are able to gain a greater share.\n\nThe breakdown of capitalism occurs when the mass of surplus value will not be increased with additional investment.\n\nIt is also important to remember that growth in the capitalist economy depends on the production and \"consumption\" of plant and equipment.\n\nI recommend the following two extracts from the WSWS for consideration:\n\n\\#1 [Correspondence on the breakdown of the profit system - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/11/corr-n01.html)\n\n\\> ... There are two sources of demand: the consumption of workers and the demand of other firms. If the demand of workers is increased this means that wages will have to rise and profits will be reduced.\n\n\\>An increase in demand from other capitalist firms\u2014a rise in productive consumption\u2014implies that these firms are increasing their investment as a result of increased profits. In other words, increased demand is not the cause of an increase in profit, but a consequence of such an increase.\n\n\\>Of course, demand may also increase as a result of growing indebtedness on the part of both workers and capitalist firms. This is very much the source of the current economic expansion in the United States. But increased debt, while it may postpone a crisis resulting from a fall in the accumulation of surplus value, cannot resolve it. Increased debts imply greater claims on future surplus value. Consequently, while providing a short-term solution, growing indebtedness will create the conditions for the eruption of an even bigger crisis in the future.\n\n\\>The only way in which the growth of debt could resolve the crisis is if it finances new methods of production which increase the overall mass of surplus value. However, if, as we have postulated, labour productivity has already developed historically to such a point that further increases only bring a decline in the overall mass of surplus value then increased indebtedness to finance new production methods will intensify the crisis of the profit system as a whole.\n\n\\>The introduction of new methods may well increase the profit of an individual firm by lowering its costs of production to below the social average. But this increase in profit will not take place as the result of a general expansion in the mass of surplus value. Rather it will be achieved at the expense of its rivals.",

Viewed from the standpoint of society as a whole, it is clear that the mass of surplus value available to capital as a whole depends on the number of productive workers (workers who produce surplus value) and the rate at which surplus value is extracted from each individual worker.\n\n\\>The development of the productivity of labour manifests itself, Marx explains, in two ways. On the one hand it brings an increase in the mass of surplus value by reducing the necessary labour time of each individual worker. At the same time, it decreases the number of productive labourers required to set in motion a given quantity of capital.\n\n\\>\u201cThe two movements,\u201d Marx writes, \u201cnot only go hand in hand, but mutually influence one another and are phenomena in which the same law expresses itself. Yet they affect the rate of profit in opposite ways. ... The surplus-value ... as a total is determined first by its rate, and second by the mass of labour simultaneously employed at this rate ... One of these factors, the rate of surplus value, rises, and the other, the number of labourers, falls (relatively or absolutely). Inasmuch as the development of the productive forces reduces the paid portion of employed labour, it raises the surplus value, because it raises its rate; but inasmuch as it reduces the total mass of labour employed by a given capital, it reduces the factor of the number by which the rate of surplus value is multiplied to obtain its mass. Two labourers, each working 12 hours daily, cannot produce the same mass of surplus value as 24 who work only 2 hours, even if they could live on air and hence did not have to work for themselves at all. In this respect, then, the compensation of the reduced number of labourers by intensifying the degree of exploitation has certain insurmountable limits. It may, for this reason, well check the fall in the rate of profit, but cannot prevent it altogether\u201d (Marx,\u00a0*Capital*, vol. III, p. 242).\n\n\\>We are now in a position, on the basis of the labour theory of value, to examine the impact of the historical development of technology upon the accumulation of surplus value.\n\n\\>If the proportionate increase in the surplus value extracted from each individual worker, arising from the development of the productivity of labour, is greater than the proportionate decrease in the number of labourers employed, then the overall mass of surplus value will tend to increase and the process of capital accumulation will proceed. But if it is smaller, then the mass of surplus value will tend to decrease.\n\n\\>Given that an increase in the productivity of labour affects the mass of surplus value in opposite ways, is the final outcome of the process indeterminate? Or does there necessarily arise a point at which further increases in the productivity of labour will bring about a decrease in the mass of surplus value?\n\n\\>We have seen from our previous analysis that there is. This is because the more the productivity of labour has already been developed the smaller will be the proportionate increase in the amount of surplus value extracted from each individual worker for every given increase in the productivity of labour.\n\n\\>When the productivity of labour was relatively low, that is, when it took 6 hours for the worker to reproduce the value of his own labour power, we saw that a doubling of the productivity of labour (the halving of the number of workers employed by a given quantity of capital) brought about a 250 percent increase in the amount of surplus value extracted from each of them. But when the productivity of labour had been developed to the point where the worker reproduced the value of his labour power in just 1.5 hours, we saw that the proportionate increase in the surplus value extracted from each of them was just 11.5 percent.",
