A person planning to consume them would choose which one? The ones that are not painted, right? \n\nThe painted orange has within itself the capacity to realize its use value, but impressions from subjective perspectives consider that it does not, which discards Marx's system. If you accept that the person is capable of designing utilities that do not match the commodity, the utility is in the commodity only as practical utility, but the utility that leads to it being valued is the expected utility. \n\nThis invalidates the fact that Marx found utility in his dialectic to find labor as exchange value.\"\n\nWhat do you think about this?

            "body": "this doesn't really counter the labor theory of value. his example is just lying to someone, which kinda defeats the purpose. labor theory of value is an objective measure based on the labor added to the parts that make up a commodity being the determinent of measureable value. the argument presented here is effectively just saying \"nuh uh\". also the example he put forward presupposes capitalist competition as there otherwise wouldn't be a reason for commodities to be sabotaged in that way. but to return to a clear point, his argument isn't against the labor theory of value, but is just saying \"actually what people like is more important than actual value\".",

            "body": "This is mixing two unconnected values: Use Value and cost to society usually referenced as value.\n\nIn order to demonstrate that. Imagine a futuristic society where everything produced by self replicating robots. What Value what they produce have? Zero, as no human labor involve, there is no cost to society. Do they produce use value? Absolutely. What exchange value (again, a different variable, as exchange value exist only in market economy) that has? Again Zero, as you can have anything you want at all time.\n\nIn a way, we have such machine, Nature. It produce air with out which we can not live. It use value is infinite, it Value is zero - no human labor used. It exchange value is zero, again, in normal condition it is abundant and available at any time.\n\nThere is a big confusion about value of commodities, as people mixing different meaning of value. So, I will try to explain value of art, so everyone think about value as it is much more complicated then we think.\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/)\n\n\"Production is consumption, Consumption is production\" - dialectical nature of production. What we can take from this? No value created with out consumption. If no one use air - no use value is created. If no one use commodity - no production value is created. It is pointless to produce something which no one use. Same true about exchange value.\n\nBut how we should understand value of an art? What I will discuss does not apply only to art, but it is just much more clear in case of an art.\n\nWe establish that with out consumption there is no value. But does value depends on consumption? Yes.\n\nLets introduce labor of consumption. Consumption is not free. Some one need to spend time and often his mind, his imagination, his mental abilities in order to extract value.\n\nIf you read scientific book, use value you extracted from it depends on how much time you spend, how well you prepared to understand and your imagination, looking how you can use this information, potentially. Same apply to art, Art effect as because we relate it to as, We do emotional labor trying to understand art. And when we do, quality of art effect how much it effect as, how much use value we get from it.\n\nAn other example, a well prepared dinner. If you have time to sit down in a nice place and enjoy your dinner - you will get much more use value, You are not only get better physical enjoyment, but your body will process food better. On other hand you can stuff this food why jingling children or try to finish work. You still will get something, but much less. Consumption is not free, it cost is labor of consumption. Why do you think your mother wanted you to sit at table and enjoy food she prepare, socialize with your family? She wanted for you to extract max value from her food, from your time with family and get value form you. She loved to see you enjoy her cooking, talk to her. In a way she consumed a family dinner she prepared. That is not a market value, but it is use value of her labor for her.\n\nEvery moment of life has value. When you stop to enjoy a view, listen to birds songs you perform a labor of consumption, which actually create value, not nature. Not self replicating machine. Nature, self replicating machine create a potential, not realized value, but your labor is necessary for value to be created, realized.",

It has nothing to do with Marx, and everything to do with anarcho capitalist and their ignorant ways of understanding the world around them. I assume his point is about the subjectivity of value, as he understands it. But even then it's in no way profound, reasonable, or even coherent as a critique of Marx.\u00a0\nMy advice is, to stop listening to people who get their political ideology from the Joe rogan podcast, or what have you, and read some Marx yourself, if you are genuinely interested. Noones gonna teach you all the ins and out of political theory through stuff like this, that's on you, to actually put in the work, if you want any of it to make sense, and not just \"sound good enough\"",

                            "body": "The simplest way to refute libertarians and ancaps and understand Marx is that they are only interested in coming up with ridiculous thought experiments. They don't live in the real world. Marx, on the other hand, is trying to understand how capitalism works. What is actually going on in capitalism. He's not trying to derive some sort of \"should be\" principles but rather understanding the underlying mechanisms of existing capitalist society.\n\nIn this case, a business will never produce an orange and then paint it rotten. This kind of stuff doesn't get produced as a commodity because it has no value. No one will buy it. If businesses did that they would not last. \n\nIt's also important to understand that Marx is talking about this stuff on a social or societal level. We talk about \"socially necessary\" labor time. If one person does something crazy it doesn't really matter in terms of value because what society in general does with oranges is not that. The value of oranges would only change if all the oranges being produced were suddenly blighted by a disease that made them fine to eat but terrible to look at. No one would buy them. And farms would stop producing them. \n\nAnd use and exchange value are subjective. We value gold and diamonds because it looks shiny. Use value doesn't just mean something is practical, it just means someone might want to buy it. We exchange gold for money and other things not because we are valuing gold for its conductive properties but because we like wearing shiny things. \n\nThe subjective shapes the objective. Marx understands that we are actively shaping the world. Even the act of observing the world is changing it. Subjective is not something separate, but it's part of the materialist understanding of the world. \n\nI'm still getting to grips with Marx but this is my understanding so far.",

            "body": "With Marx, the spoilage of commodities works much like consumption. Just as the value disappears with consumption, so too does it diminish with spoilage. A seller or producer could also deliberately trash the oranges and the value diminishes in proportion as the value of those oranges is trashed and thus destroyed. \n\nThis scenario presented in the OP merely creates the appearance of spoilage. However to the extent the grift is successful it is no different than trashing the oranges.  If each orange has a value of 50\u00a2 and the shelf contains 50 oranges deliberately trashed as a a spoilage grift, then $25 in value has been consumed.\n\nIf subsequently, a worker pulls the oranges from the trash, cleans them and removes their painted spoilage appearance, then that labor might be counted as the production of 50 oranges. If this becomes a customary social process, then the value of each orange would rise because some portion of oranges must be produced, painted as spoiled, and then restored to a salable condition (adding to the socially necessary labor-time required to produce all oranges). In contrast, without that detour the oranges merely need to be cultivated and brought to market without all of the extra work, or without deliberately trashing some portion of the oranges (meaning more oranges produced with the same socially necessary labor-time).",
