You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

Many people just got paid today and so if anything there's going to be a clear rise in sales. Any serious organizer should look at this and immediately see exceptionally bad and ineffective planning. Unfortunately that is built into these protest techniques.\n\nIf you want to wage class war against Amazon or Starbucks, you do it through a long and organized effort such as a salting campaign. But the liberal prefers \"protest\" because he has a nearly lethal allergy to organizing, to class war, to revolutionary thinking.\n\nUnsurprisingly when contextualized against the complete lack of class consciousness in this country, people fail to understand how bad the situation is. The National Guard was once reformed to murder striking workers. Today, we have entities such as DSAC, the NLRB is crippled, the math of the economy is still spilling forth from 2007/2008, the list goes on. It should come as no surprise that a complete misunderstanding of the severity and the necessity of the class war produces a nearly childlike and impotent reaction to certain aspects of it. \n\nAgain, I don't mean any offense to anyone here. Sorry if that sounds harsh.",

Leaving aside what others have said here about the inefficient nature of short term boycotts, namely what's not bought today will be bought tomorrow. What these do is falsely teach people that their most fundamental power is in their consumption and not in their labor.\u00a0\n\n\nIf we pushed for a one day strike, that would be powerful. By withholding out labor we withhold from the capitalists the creation of the value that drives our economy. Everyone who didn't call off work but didn't purchase anything did not reduce the value created for the capitalists, they only relayed its realization in the market.\n\n\nThese boycotts further the atomized conception of the working class and make it more difficult to build the solidarity necessary to overthrow capitalism.\n\n\nBack in The Before Times, in the Long Long Ago, many comrades I knew during the 2011 Wisconsin protests against the right-wing attacks on public unions were pushing for a one day general strike. As Marxists this is the kind of \"boycott\" we should be pushing people towards.",

It snot just one boycott, but through the rest of the year, there will be multiple. Rather than nitpicking and poking holes and criticizing, any form of protest and resistance must be celebrated and supported right now. Improvement will happen. The actions will get better. One thing I learned was to never give advice or criticism unless they're allowed with consent at a very young age :)",

The reason for avoiding credit cards, I would assume, is because they are large corporations and using their card at a smaller business is actually providing business to the large credit card corporation. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any allying going on, more like triage of who to put most effort into avoiding.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it either. I think these sorts of strategies can be effective if a huge number of people really participate. Shorter boycotts may be symbolic, but with enough people it makes a statement. To the boycotters themselves it\u2019s an exercise in restraint, and if you\u2019ve done it for one day it will make it easier to do it for a week, a month, or longer in the future. And to the business owners it says we are willing to restructure our purchasing if you continue doing what you\u2019re doing. \n\nBut without enough people I worry that a publicly called for boycott just telegraphs weakness. If we all blast out \u201cbuy nothing\u201d but very few people really participate it will show the business owners that they don\u2019t really need to fear people organizing right now.",
