    "selftext": "Something that few Marxists are aware of is that dialectical materialism is in opposition to many of the predominant theories in bourgeois sciences, such as some of the postulates of the big bang theory and the multiple speculations that are made regarding quantum physics. Marxism understands that there is no separation of natural sciences and philosophy, the development of theories for natural science necessarily involves philosophical reflection, whether this is done consciously or unconsciously, consequentially or inconsequentially. This separation is artificial, the result of the crisis of bourgeois philosophy and the rise of bourgeois scientism, only an apparent separation, when in reality bourgeois scientism continues to be permeated with idealistic, metaphysical philosophical understandings and crude empiricism.\n\nStates guided by Marxism, such as the USSR and China before their revisionist degeneration, developed a range of scientific material comprising the conception of dialectical materialism, however this material is not easily accessible, which makes the study of the Marxist conception in the natural sciences Very limited are the few Western productions that we have guided by the method of dialectical materialism or at least with an unconscious understanding of the objective characteristics of dialectical materiality that bourgeois sciences tend not to understand.\n\nthe existence of a matter compressed in a micro space leads to the logical conclusion that for an eternity there was no phenomenon of negation of negation, or that these phenomena of negation of negation only resulted in qualitative transformations at the quantum level, and that suddenly one has the big bang as the great phenomenon of the negation of negation, however this generates a paradox, because this period \"before the big bang\" is an eternity, and there is no logical sense in believing that from an eternity composed of micro phenomena a phenomenon emerges macro, this is exactly the same paradox that we have with creationism, where the created whole emerges from eternal nothingness, and that is why the big bang model is essentially creationist\n\nThe big bang is an absurd hypothesis, irrationalism painted as science, the decadent bourgeois scientists prefer to take it as the most plausible hypothesis rather than return to the most basic philosophical logic to question their crude empiricism\n\nI recently heard about a current cosmologist who is apparently as great for our times as Darwin was in Engels' time, Eric Lerner defends, just like Engels, a theory of an infinite and eternal universe, I really still need to read his works but I confess to being excited with mr. Lerner. If you could send me more recent materials on the dialectics of nature I would be very grateful.",

            "body": "When you make the method absolute and deny the objectiveness of material reality, the result is idealism. \n\nSorry, but what you are saying makes no sense. Dialectical materialism is a method of interpreting reality and it's phenomena, but from it no statement about reality can be made. We can only get a grasp of the concrete from the concrete itself, of which empirical evidence is the immediate source of information. From this empirical evidence abstractions can be made, eventually decomposing reality into its most fundamental determinations. From these, the concrete can be conceptualized again, this time not as it immediately appears empirically to our perception, but as a synthesis of it's determinations, as an ideal reflect of it's effective movement. This is the process of dialectical materialism.\n\nAt no point can you introduce into reality notions or concepts not derived from material reality, such as \"the phenomenon of negation of negation\". You don't preconceive reality to conform to certain laws or principles. You derive those laws or principles from observation and abstraction of material reality itself. Dialectical Materialism is in no way in opposition to the Big Bang theory, because the Big Bang theory is firmly supported by a mass of empirical evidence derived from observations of material reality. And so is quantum physics and its results.\n\nNow, there is absolutely a case to be made against ontological interpretations of these results, not only among philosophy but on the fields of physics and cosmology; also, there is the fact that dialectical materialism is more capable as a method for attaining truths about our reality than the neokantist/neopositivist views that dominate, but that's beyond the point.\n\nI recommend you take a look at Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs' work, specifically his Ontology of the Social Being, for a critique of mainstream bourgeois conceptions of reality.",
