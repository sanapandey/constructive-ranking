    "selftext": "Marx criticizes Hegelian idealism because it argues that big ideas are the drivers of history, whereas Marx argues that it is human beings that drive history, specifically humans that are driven to action by material forces. If we say that Freedom or Liberty, or even that governments or specific leaders or companies, are the prime movers of events, we give power to abstract constructs that confuse the student of history and mystify the actual driving force behind every important event: humans working together to satisfy their material needs.\n\nMarx connects this materialist critique to his ideas about alienation. We alienate humans from the fruits of their labor by attributing their good works to nonexistent constructs, giving the credit due to human beings (for revolutions and large building projects and the development of science/democracy) to Idea. If something was created by humans, we must give humans the credit, and celebrate what we can accomplish when we all work together. This is a celebration of humankind, and denigration of the practice of robbing man of his species essence and accomplishments by claiming that only states and governments and elites and ideas create great things. Humans, driven by their material needs, make history; this cooperation is part of what makes humans human! Consequently we go on to form big ideas and abstract concepts to help us understand this history, but ideas are the products of man, not man\u2019s master. Of course the powerful elites and those who serve them use culture and ideology to convince us that we (the people) are not the drivers of history, thereby robbing humankind of one of its primal attributes. They want us to forget that all we need to accomplish great things is lots of human beings working side by side on a common goal.\n\nMarx wishes to return our species essence to us by reminding us that we make history, we accomplish great things together. All these constructs that seem to have lives of their own, that appear to have autonomy and power over us, are actually just dead things that we have temporarily animated by lending them our species essence. If we remember that we can shape the future simply by working together on a common goal, we rob these constructs of their very life, and empower ourselves to create the change we want to see.\n\nAt the same time, Marx breathes life into capital many times, speaking of capital as if it is a living, breathing thing, or a monster, or blood sucking vampire, or a creature with an insatiable desire to grow itself. In his theory of alienation, capital (man\u2019s invention) becomes man\u2019s master while man becomes the slave. Capital turns man into a robot, a production machine, a surplus value generator. Capital has a personality and a reason for existing; it has goals and a mind of its own, and we are helpless under its power. Marx sees this as an empowering message because he argues that if we remember our power and work together, then we can overthrow capital and finally realize our potential.\n\nBut these two theories contradict one another. How can we claim that it is wrong to give credit to other constructs for moving events forward, while arguing that capital has a mind of its own, that we are slaves to our creation, and that capital\u2019s desire to expand itself drives events? We must recall that capital itself is a construct that mystifies the processes of history: humans are the real movers. Therefore it isn\u2019t capital that demands to expand itself, but human beings choosing to exploit others for profit. It isn\u2019t capital that forces children into factories and lowers wages in order to extract more surplus value; it is humans who do these things, men who make these decisions. Capitalism is not wrecking the environment: humans are. Capitalism doesn\u2019t alienate us from the fruits of our labor; human bosses, CEOs, managers, stockholders, consultants, consumers, marketers, etc. do. Therefore it isn\u2019t capital we need to overthrow if we wish to create communism, but human action, human behavior, perhaps our own nature, we must overcome.\n\nIf we give credit to capital for doing so many things, we give credit to a non-existent figment of our collective imaginations. Might as well say that it is the idea of liberty that drives revolutions, rather than humans who wish for better material conditions. Marx seems guilty of the crime he lays at the feet of ideologues who want us to believe that constructs are actually running the show so that we don\u2019t realize that when humans work together we achieve great things. This is the opposite though: Marx would rather not acknowledge that when humans work together (as exploiters must do to run large capitalist organizations) we can accomplish horrible things in the name of profit; easier to claim that these crimes are actually committed by capital, and we are powerless slaves who cannot escape the grasp of our own invention. Or that if we only could escape it\u2019s grasp, we would finally be free to live in equality. But what are we really overthrowing but the behavior of humans with human brains? Marx\u2019s argument depnds on the notion that there is an entity in control that can be overthrown. If we acknowledge there is no other entity, that we are the drivers of history, we find ourselves in a position where we must acknowledge that if we transition to communism we will still be the same humans, capable of the same greatness and horror. No matter where we go, there we are.\n\nThis is not a petty gripe against Marx or some pointless semantic critique. This is a critical point. If humans are actually in the driver\u2019s seat, and there is no such thing as capital pushing events forward or growing itself or exploiting workers, then what does this say about human nature? It seems that Marx would rather not admit that human nature has a dark side, or that profit motive and the desire to compete (maybe even exploit) might be hard-wired into us, because that casts doubt on the liklihood of us ever achieving communism (since we can\u2019t help but exploit each other, to compete, to form factions, to seek advantage, to alienate those more vulnerable than ourselves). But if we blame capital and capitalism for this exploitation and alienation, then it becomes easier to believe that if we just overthrow capitalism, we will be free of this slavery, and humans can finally live in unity and harmony and equality and peace. It isn\u2019t our own greed that makes this impossible; it is our invention, capital, holding us down, putting its non-existent heel on our throats. But if this turns out to be just another flavor of idealism, and greed is actually part of our nature, and we will exploit each other whether capital is abolished or not, it makes the revolution (and the violent action required to kickstart it) seem much less worthwhile. In this light communism appears a pale, utopian dream. As long as the utopia has humans in it, there will be a mixture of misery and joy, great deeds and lowly ones, kindness and greed, but never communism.\n\nMarx is a materialist. But mustn\u2019t a materialist reject Marx\u2019s perspective on capital? If we can blame a construct like capital for the woes of mankind, then why not breathe life as well into the other big ideas of history like freedom and liberty, and hand them the credit for driving forward all the progress mankind has made in the past 300 years? Of course a materialist cannot accept this premise! Men did those things, and that makes men great. And so then we must admit that men did all the evil things we accuse capital of doing, and that makes men shitty. Materialism does not allow us to have one but not the other.",

            "body": "I am going to assume this is made in good faith here and that you are trying to understand these ideas by putting them into argument form...\n\n  \nMarx regularly speaks of functions and structures that are out of human control. What does he mean by this? If we look at the individual workers, they enter into the workforce since they need to eat. Because of this need to eat, the worker works under conditions that they find ready-made, and their work is (I use this as a technical term) \"exploited\" for, in the case of \"productive labor,\" the production of surplus value. We see that the action of the individual is highly limited by their material conditions, here primarily the ownership of the means of labor. If I don't eat I will die. To eat I find the conditions of work, which are owned by capitalists. My \"formal freedom\" of choice and my action has a, so to speak, set course. I will work for a wage (thus part of the day unpaid) to not die.\n\n  \nNow the other side of the coin. The capitalist, to remain in their position, must obey competition and the pressure of other capitalists. This entails the expansion of enterprises, the adoption of improvements to industry, etc. If they do not do this, they cease to be a capitalist and are bought out or declare bankruptcy.\n\n> ...the capitalist is just as enslaved by the relationships of capitalism as is his opposite pole, the worker, albiet in a quite different manner \n\n('Results of the Immediate Process of Production,' p.990 in Penguin's Vol. 1)\n\nEven if this class was motivated by a wonderful drive for greed, they still could not exhibit this greed in a non-alienated manner. They must obey the laws and pressure of competition.\n\nThere are man-made structures at play that condition the choices of the concrete individuals involved. If we are to analyze society, we have to understand that human behavior is deeply conditioned by the structural and historical incentives which, yes, are created by different humans.\n\nNow, on your point about materialists using abstractions.\n\nCategories and abstractions have a very specific function in Marx's mature work:\n\n> These categories \\[in social sciences\\] therefore express the forms of being, the characteristics of existence\n\n('Grundrisse', \"Introduction\")\n\nCategories always express elements and relations of human actuality. For instance, when Marx speaks of \"capital\" as a category, in much the same way as he speaks of \"value\" as a category, he is referencing a specific social relationship and process. It is both a relationship between owner and worker, as well as the circulation of the products of this relationship.\n\n> Capital... does not just comprise class relations, a definite social character that depends on the existence of labour as wage-labour. It is a movement, a circulatory process through different stages. \n\n(Capital Vol. 2, Ch. 4)\n\nJust after this line, Marx speaks directly to you!\n\n> Those who consider the autonomization of value as a mere abstraction forget that the movement of industrial capital is this abstraction in action.\n\n(Capital Vol. 2, Ch. 4)\n\nCapital is a structural and social system. When we refer to it as the \"automatic subject\" (Capital Vol. 1, Ch. 4, p. 255), we are describing this structure and how it actually, really does influence behavior; an abstraction in action!\n\nYour groundless speculations about avaricious human nature and Marx denying the \"evil\" (?) in mankind do not make sense. It is not \"idealist\" to depict the structure of society, which we can only describe with words and think in thoughts, in the form of categories.\n\nI suggest you background much of the early Marx (1844) you know, and anything else that has been passed down to you about this thinker, and to reapproach with a more ripe mind. Although I hope the use of your brain isn't too idealist...  \n\n\nIn short\n\n> Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\n\n('18th Brumaire...', Chapter I)\n\n  \nBest of luck!",
