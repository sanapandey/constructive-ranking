            "body": "I disagree with a point of emphasis in that the fall of Assad is preferable to his regime staying and the working class of Syria will likely benefit more than under his regime. I think you are overemphasising imperialist dynamics and the reactionary nature of the militia groups and under emphasising the fact that Assad\u2019s regime destroyed Syria, outlawed all working class political freedoms, rendered half of the population homeless and 1/3 of the country left its borders for fear of intense repression - torture and mass murder. It also paved the way for Islamic fundamentalism and stoked sectarian tensions literally provoking skirmishes and pogroms between sects. HTS is hardly supportable but the crucial thing is this gives the chance for Syria to recover, hopefully an end to homelessness, recovery of the economy and for independent working class politics to actually form and exist. Under Assad that wasn\u2019t really an option because he just killed them. The popular committees were basically massacred or displaced into nonexistence during the Arab spring. There\u2019s nothing to suggest such a dire situation will continue with Assad gone. Turkey and the Kurds largely just want to kill one another. HTS has moderated significantly and is currently posturing to establish a democratic state (we should follow this closely for they are not to be trusted). Israel might try bomb Syria more which is extremely unhelpful but is largely just concerned with denying the Syrian people who despise Israel Assad\u2019s modern weapons. \n\nThe Syrian working class finally has a bit of breathing room. Tens of thousands of people are already returning. The highways are clogged with people entering the country for the first time in 15 years. The prisons have been emptied of people who haven\u2019t seen the light for decades.",
