So what do y\u2019all think? \n\nAlso they made the critique that there\u2019s no way the state will just wither away which I sympathize with on some level. However that reality is too far in the distant, hypothetical future for us to really care about right now but we should think about it. What are your personal Marxist theories on how the socialist states will wither away in the future? ",

            "body": "It really depends what you mean by authority. I think people misrepresent both the anarchist and the Marxist positions. Anarchists don\u2019t think authority based on expertise is bad inherently, you would still go to a trained doctor for medical advice but even that system of knowledge I believe would be different under anarchist relations. They use power analysis to see what moves people, what is exerting pressure on who and why. For example why is the school making the decision to ban a club, reason the PTA is exerting pressure by saying this is bad for kids and we will get you in trouble or remove funding if allow it thereby making the school act in a certain way. For us Marxists power analysis isn\u2019t useless and can be helpful, but we have a materialist conception of the state, the state isn\u2019t something necessary or something that is consciously created, it arises from the the material conditions of class society, it arises from the need to subjugate one class to the whims of the other. Humans for the most part have lived in classless societies and in those cases states did not exist! This is why Marxists say the state will wither away, the proletarians must subjugate the bourgeois under their rule and unfortunately it will be forceful or else there is no way to defend ourselves from the state power that they hold. When the distinctions of class are removed from society then the state will have no more purpose or material grounds to stand upon. Authority in this case is sometimes necessary and it can be a tool for the working class, not that we don\u2019t have collective decision making processes but that a certain amount of authority is necessary to protect the gains of the working class. The state withers away because who do you have to subjugate? We have abolished class. This brings up the question of a bureaucratic class created by the party, which is a fair question to ask, what needs to always be understood is that the party cannot be separated from the working class it must be embedded in and part of the working class, Mao\u2019s mass line addresses this question pretty well. This is super simplified run down. I would recommend reading Marxists to see their full analyses",

I\u2019ll do that but first, I\u2019d like to really emphasize the role of material conditions for Marxism. There\u2019s a reason the scientific development of Marxism as a thought and a science did not develop during the ancient Greeks, it wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t think about society hard enough but rather that the time they were living in was materially not at the level to even conceptually think up the ideas of Marxism they would just seem absurd. For example we can imagine a hunter gatherer society praying to a deity of hunting, but they certainly wouldn\u2019t come up conceptually with the idea of praying to or even realizing a deity of farming because they just were not living in that type of material condition. This doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t intelligent or creative it just point to how fundamental the way we structure our society for our given needs influences our ideas. This means we will constantly be learning and growing including Marxist theories and science. So taking that into account the answers to those extremely important and pressing question will be much more available to us once we are in the material and technological conditions of that time and through a concrete analysis of those specific conditions. For now we can come up with ideas and plans some of which may bear fruit. We can think of technology being to the point of advancement (under the rule and for the purpose of the people not the profits of a select few) is able to produce most of our needs while leaving us with very little to do with production. I believe at the stage in which the state is completely abolished all labour will be voluntary, people will consult experts and councils of the people can work with said experts to plan logistics with the help of technology. I think things like sustainability of resources and nature need to be studied and understood as much as we can do that as councils as people as experts we can come together to make decisions that will allow us to protect our planet and provide the needs of everyone. Advanced algorithms can possibly be used to make planning easier and remove the risk of mismanagement. People as a whole might be much more political in the sense they will be taking direct decisions on their future and their current needs than now, we can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to not be alienated from process of production. We can also look to historical examples that attempted to implement some of these things what their failure were and how we can ensure they won\u2019t repeat such as the famines from the Great Leap Forward (I say this as a Maoist).",

But if I take it in a more general sense of: \"Do you have to work at a factory if you are assigned to it?\" Also no, but there would obviously most likely still need to be incentives for working in general and - if the factory in the next town desperatedly needs workers - additional incentives to work at that factory even though it might be farther from your home or otherwise less desirable. These incentives is one function we use money for today. But considering modern computing capacities, I don't think the simplification through money is needed anymore, but more about that later.\n\n> who decides whether a factory makes sense to build at the location you have in mind?\n\nThe people that are making this decisions now or someone of similar expertise will still be available to make these decisions, except if we notice, that the decisions made were not made with the best interest oft the public in mind, then we might have to change the people or the system. But finding out something *didn't* work as we would like it to work should lead to optimization and not unsolvable problems.\n\n> who connects roads, or, power, or water?\n\n\"Stateless society\" doesn't mean there is no bodies where these decisions are made. What do you propose as a possible difficulty to experts and involved parties (not the political kind) coming together and making these decisions? It's just that they can't be made that easily over so many people's heads anymore.\n\n> who plans capacity for that infrastructure to handle your factory's needs?\n\nAgain.. you would have to explain how and why this would be harder than it is now.\n\n> how do we account for all these myriad trade-offs that occur at multiple scales without something like money?\n\nFactory X produces chairs because people need chairs, it uses the electricy made by plant Y, which produces electricity because people need electricity, X's waste water is cared for by the sewage people, who maintain the sewage system because people need a functioning sewage system.\n\nCould you explain what exactly these \"trade-offs\" are, that you are talking about?\n\n> I'm not talking about \"motivation\" or kindergarten-level like \"boo hoo everyone gets paid the same\" nonsense, I'm talking about population-scale infrastructure, supply chain planning, like if we seize the means of production, we have to actually manage the work of producing everything for the entire human race, and there are a lot of difficult problems involved in that whose only currently known solution involves the use of capital.\n\nIf \"we\" seize the means of production we will most likely have to go through a prolonged stage of socialism first, not necessarily because we don't theoretically know how to do a communism, but because society will mostly have to undergo a slow metamorphosis to where communism is even possible.\n\nIf we have then established egalitarity as a basic value of our society just as we do now with private property, I don't see the big difficulty in the logistics or other organizational problems of a moneyless society. All of these things are done by people now, they will be done by people then. \n\nI'm sorry, I really can't see the big problem with any of that.\n\nLike.. in most of the transactions that happen to get a product from source to consumer, money only plays the role of incentive (or more often compulsion but the two are somewhat similar) or universal trading value. Incentives are easy to come by, compulsions we want to get rid off as much as possible and the universal trading value might for example exist only mathematically/theoretically, which wouldn't be a problem at all given even current computing power. As an example for that last part: Let's say we underproduced on fridges and desperately need some additional fridges (ignoring that it should be pretty easy to calculate these things with today's computing capabilities). A reasonable trade value for that (time, amount, additional work etc.) could be computed (or maybe otherwise determined) and the workers working overtime or otherwise especially hard to produce those extra fridges could be awarded with an appropriate incentive.\n\nAfter all this, one could ask, why not just keep money, if it is mostly an universal trade value anyway.. The reason is that this property of money is a double edged sword as it can also be easily and rather stealthily converted to political power for example.",

I don't think you have a real conception of what I'm even talking about.\n> \n> no single person makes these decisions right now. the decisions are made collaboratively by massive numbers of people. the medium they use to signal each other is money\n\nI'm sorry if my non-native use of the english language made you think, that I believe any of these decisions were made by a single person. I don't.\n\nWhat exactly does this process of \"signaling with money\" entail that is hard to accomplish without money, *if* we consider an appropriately transformed society with new values/values differing from the ones we have now (and please don't just dismiss this as being close to impossible. Things like private property, freedom of speech or freedom in general are just a few examples of values that haven't been that ingrained in society for a particular long time)?\n\n> because we have existing systems that solve these hard problems in some way. if you take away the solution, you have to make a new one. making a new solution is harder than using an existing solution\n\nBut the things you were talking about there (roads, electricity, ...) are in most states of the world state controlled and not exactly very capitalistic ventures. The people making these decisions work in agencies whose purpose it is to manage those infrastructures. What parts of that would have to change significantly?\n\n> there's a finite amount of concrete humanity can produce in a year. who gets it and who doesn't? that's a trade-off.\n\n> others would include things like \"how far into the backcountry should we run fiber optic lines?\" or \"should we invest into factories for consumer goods or for industrial equipment\" (this last one should sound familiar if you've studied soviet history)\n\nMaking these decisions with the welfare of society as goal instead of profit, should lead to better outcomes though, shouldn't it? Again, we don't have to change all of the underlying systems. Just posing the question of \"What is best for the people?\" instead of \"What brings the most profit?\" wouldn't be that much of a change.\n\nIt's not as if this profit motive would lead to good decisions all the time anyway. Short sighted profit motives even ruin the companies themselves quite often, not to talk about ruining the environment and other really bad consequences. So just like in the two points above, I can only imagine that this again comes down to the role of money as a mediator which, I have to say, still remains nebulous in your argument.\n\n> are you saying communism is just democratic socialism with star trek belief-in-the-future characteristics?\n\n> that doesn't seem like it could be correct.\n\nI'm sorry.. What?! I don't get your point. I talked about about giving society time to acclimate to changes in ideology and core values. How did that lead to this quite desparaging response of yours?\n\n> are you saying we do? what's the blueprint then let's try it out in practice at small scales\n\n1. *No* it didn't say that, I only said it wasn't the reason\n2. Just because we know how something could be done, it doesn't have to work on a small scale\n3. What even is a small scale? There is plenty of small, functioning communes. If the scale gets much bigger the US comes in and coup d'etats your ass or kills your leaders\n\n> who is responsible for computing this \"trade value\"? how do we make sure they're accurate and unbiased? how do they receive feedback? what incentive do they have to be correct? how much should they take into account?\n\nWell, the values would have to be adjusted in way that people would be incentivized enough for all the needed work to happen. This might lead to people working in mines and the sewage system getting a lot of these incentives. There we would have to watch out for these incentives to not be to close to money (like a bigger house, personal woods or something else permanent) so they can't be exchanged for money, but rather fleeting or strictly personal things like vacations, more free time, earlier retirement etc.\n\nThe feedback and also part of the incentive would then, simply put, be a functioning society. The right amount of workers in the right places doing the right amount of work in the right time. People permanently working on this problem is obviously in danger of abuse but I think most of the actual work could be done by algorithms and how these function could be decided democraticly. But these are details. We can't get lost in these, and it would be unreasonable to ask me to present you with the perfect system from my fingertips.\n\n> I'm sorry this seems far more impractical than even bitcoin\n\nWhy? What does this even have to do with bitcoin? Also.. bitcoin would be working perfectly fine if it's purpose was only to replace money afaik but I'm no expert on this",

We developed to the point that our needs are not just met by small-scale communes that produce enough food for those present. We do have communes and some of them do well for themselves but are not self-sufficient for those with complex needs. And how would that expand?

We fall into the same issues you brought up but to a greater degree. How will medicine be shipped between independent communes who developed at different times and all the while still have capitalist powers at play interfering as they develop. The big scale of communism is needed to ensure that it can subdue the powers of capital and realize the freedom of all, not just those in this or that commune. \n\n  \nWhen I say consciously it means we are deliberately producing for needs of everyone and to make that clearer we can contrast it with capitalist production, which allows supply and demand to make the decisions of what we produce based on what will create more profit.

For an example, if the state decides to lower the minimum wage, then it is the ruling class who writes that law, and if the state declares war on another state then the declaration is written by the wealthy ruling class, not the workers and poor people.\n\nSince authority figures serve the state, it therefore means that authority serves the ruling class and follows the orders of the rich and powerful while oppressing the lower class.",

Whether we choose to call them \"states\" or not is a pedantic distinction, and I'm sure the anarchists will waste no time in pointing this out. I am sympathetic to the anarchist position (as a former anarchist myself), but I just can't shake the feeling that Anarchy would see human society reduced to little enclaves of a prefeudal character, and I am absolutely not charmed by the fascist call to RETVRN to our supposed roots.
