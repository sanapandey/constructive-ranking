            "body": ">\"Whenever Marx\u2019s theory is spoken of, eventually the catchword dialectics (or: dialectical development, dialectical method, dialectical portrayal) pops up, and in most cases, there is no explanation of what exactly is meant by this word. Most notably in Marxist political parties, opponents in an argument frequently accuse each other of having an \u201cundialectical conception\u201d of whatever matter is being debated. Also today, in Marxist circles people speak of something standing in a \u201cdialectical relationship\u201d to another thing, which is supposed to clarify everything. And some\u00adtimes, whenever one makes a critical inquiry, one is answered with the know-it-all admonishment that one has to \u201csee things dialectically.\u201d In this situation, one shouldn\u2019t allow oneself to be intimidated, but should rather constantly annoy the know-it-all by asking what exactly is under\u00adstood by the term \u201cdialectics\u201d and what the \u201cdialectical view\u201d looks like. \n\n>More often than not, the grandiose rhetoric about dialectics is reducible to the simple fact that everything is dependent upon everything else and is in a state of interaction and that it\u2019s all rather complicated\u2014which is true in most cases, but doesn\u2019t really say anything.\n\n>If dialectics is spoken of in a less superficial sense, then one can make a rough distinction between two ways of using this term. In one sense, dia\u00adlectics is considered to be, according to Engel\u2019s text Anti-D\u00fchring, \u201cthe science of the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society and thought\u201d (MECW, 25:131). According to this conception, dia\u00adlectical development does not proceed uniformly and in a linear manner, but is rather a \u201cmovement in contradictions.\u201d Of particular importance for this movement are the \u201cchange of quantity into quality\u201d and the \u201cnegation of the negation.\u201d6 Whereas Engels was clear that with such general state\u00adments nothing is understood about individual processes,7 this was any\u00adthing but clear within the framework of worldview Marxism; \u201cdialectics,\u201d understood as the general science of development, was often viewed as a sort of Rosetta Stone with which everything could be explained.\n\n>The second way in which dialectics is spoken of relates to the form of depiction in the critique of political economy. Marx speaks on vari\u00adous occasions of his \u201cdialectical method,\u201d and in doing so also praises Hegel\u2019s achievements. Dialectics played a central role in Hegel\u2019s philoso\u00adphy. However, Marx alleges that Hegel \u201cmystified\u201d dialectics, and that his dialectic is therefore not the same as Hegel\u2019s. This method gains impor\u00adtance with the \u201cdialectical presentation\u201d of categories. This means that in the course of the presentation the individual categories are unfolded from one another: they are not simply presented in succession or alongside each other. Rather, their interrelationship (how one category necessitates the ex\u00adistence of another) is made clear. The structure of the depiction is therefore not a didactic question for Marx, but has a decisive substantive meaning.\n\n>However, this dialectical portrayal is in no way the result of the \u201cap\u00adplication\u201d of a ready-made \u201cdialectical method\u201d to the content of politi\u00adcal economy. Ferdinand Lassalle intended such an \u201capplication,\u201d which caused Marx to express the following in a letter to Engels: \u201cHe will dis\u00adcover to his cost that it is one thing for a critique to take a science to the point at which it admits of a dialectical presentation, and quite another to apply an abstract, ready-made system of logic to vague presentiments of just such a system\u201d (MECW, 40:261).\n\n>The precondition of a dialectical portrayal is not the application of a method (a widespread conception in worldview Marxism), but rather the categorical critique, discussed in the previous section. And such a categor\u00adical critique presumes an exact and detailed familiarity and engagement with the substance of a field of knowledge to which the categories refer.\"\n\n\u2014Michael Heinrich, An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx's Capital",

                    "body": "This is the way, great text. As add-ons, let me note one has to go to the Capital to see Marxian dialectics at play, in the form of an immanent critique of political economy as an ideological science, where the concept of plus-value is stripped of its magic-like qualities and explained through basic relations. It is also important to note that, for Marx to develop his dialectical method, Kant's work (where the concept of immanent critique comes from) was as necessary as Hegel's, although much less often mentioned. I would suggest anyone wanting to dive deeper into the meaning of dialectics to try to read some Adorno texts; the question was crucial for him, and he has lots of good explanations around it.",

            "body": "To clarify the original questions from your original post, dialectic is simply the study of change, movement, it's the opposite of taking a static point and studying it. What Hegel, Marx and others tried to do is explain why there's a change, what drives the change? (in classical dialectic the focus was on conversations, but the real subject studied was what caused the other to change their mind, it was still the study of change itself, how one idea lead to the transformation of another)\n\nHegel never used the thesis-synthesis-antithesis method, that's a more rigid approach associated with Fichte. For Hegel, contradictions within a concept is what causes change, but it's much more fluid and complex and couldn't be reduced to a simple framework... I would suggest you to read [The Science of Logic](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/hl_index.htm), and consult those [Diagrams of Hegel\u2019s Logic](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/diagrams.htm) if you want a (much) deeper explanation of how he approached the subject. \n\nMarx's dialectical approach is heavily built on Hegel's, so it can be hard to understand without at least some introduction to the former. [This article on dialectical materialism](https://dashthered.medium.com/marxism-for-normal-people-dialectical-materialism-deb5034685a4) might be helpful tho, I think it oversimplifies Hegel, but it's a good introduction of the concepts, especially if your goal is to understand Marx and you don't care too much about Hegel.\n\nFor Marx's own work, [Theses On Feuerbach](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm) would be useful and is relatively short, but keep it mind Feuerbach also had a different approach on dialectics so Marx is not directly criticising Hegel here.\n\nWhy are dialectics useful? Because it's quite great to be able to use abstractions to think about certain phenomena, but it's only useful in terms of reality itself, and reality is in constant evolution. Dialectics are useful because they highlight how everything is interconnected and how things only exist in relation to each others, that you can't remove something without affecting everything else.",

            "body": "If you look up the Buddhist concept of dependent origination, it will approximate the materialist approach needed to understand dialectics. Everything is interdependent on one another. Nothing exists independently and everything is dependent on causes and conditions. Think about a car. If you take apart a car and scatter its parts all over the ground, is it still a car? Think about the labor it took to build that car. Think about the materials the car parts were made of. Think about the conditions needed to create the elements and compounds, of which the materials making up the car consist of. Now think about the laborers who build the car. What conditions and causes went into their labor? The food that was fed to them, which came from the fields, farmed by farmers, and the sperm and egg from which those farmers were born from, on a planet that is just the correct distance from the sun, to support life through the right conditions for liquid water to exist. \n\nWithin this, dialectics speaks of seemingly contradictory, yet interdependent forces within the universe that give rise to other conditions. Think of being a person who values honesty, yet you occasionally tell white lies to spare the feelings of others. Sometimes you tell lies and honesty is important to you. Both of those things are equally true. From this apparent contradiction, rises a new state of being able to be skillfully and compassionately honest, without letting the rigidity of black-and-white thinking dictate your actions.\n\nThe oppression apparent in class warfare, where the bourgeois exploits and brutally suppresses workers for the surplus value of their labor, creates the contradictory condition of the worker rising up to seize power from the  bourgeois. The tremendous wealth, infrastructure and potential prosperity generated by capitalism also is accompanied by deep inequality and injustice in the distribution of resources.",

                    "body": "To add to this, capitalism and class society in general is in contradiction to the original egalitarian, classless, communistic society of pre-modern humanity, but rose out of those conditions, and likewise communism arises from capitalism, but is contradictory to it. Socialism is the \"negation of the negation\", negating the class distinctions of capitalism which were the negation of earlier egalitarian societies. Capitalism contains within it the seeds for socialism to come about, as it results in material and capital development which reduces the need for human labour, while impoverishing workers but bringing them into close proximity through urbanisation, producing a revolutionary class.\n\n\nHegel's idea of dialectics was that \"ideas contain their opposites\". More broadly Hegel's philosophy was that human ideas become more refined over time through the dialectic process, where new ideas negating previous ones come into existence, gradually refining our understanding of the world. In Hegel's view the end goal of this was maximizing human freedom. Marx applied this idea to the ideas of his time, that being primarily liberalism. His major contribution to dialectics is materialism, i.e. contradictions between classes and material circumstances rather than ideas. From this he arrived at the class distinction of proletariat and bourgeoise.",

For example, the material conditions of feudal society led into the creation of capitalism. \n\nWithout an understanding of dialectics, one might erroneously assume that capitalism sprung up out of nowhere or through the whims of someone's idea. However, we know that this is not the case. It was due to the merchant class becoming increasingly self-sustainable and independent from the nobility to the point where a market system arose.

Materialist Dialectics is the form of Dialectics that Engels and Marx developed, I've never seen it referred to as \"Marxist Dialectics\". With that said, It is a world view that asserts that reality starts with the material, and through practice in the material world, it develops our consciousness. As our consciousness develops, we impact the material world, changing it, and thereby changing our consciousness. It rejects Idealism, and seeks to root socialist practice in reality. \n\nTo quote Engels from *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific:*\n\n>Hence, from this nothing could come but a kind of eclectic, average Socialism, which, as a matter of fact, has up to the present time dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in France and England. Hence, a mish-mash allowing of the most manifold shades of opinion: a mish-mash of such critical statements, economic theories, pictures of future society by the founders of different sects, as excite a minimum of opposition; a mish-mash which is the more easily brewed the more definite sharp edges of the individual constituents are rubbed down in the stream of debate, like rounded pebbles in a brook. **To make a science of Socialism, it had first to be placed upon a real basis.**\n\nThe entire goal of this project created by Marx and Engels wasn't to simply *think dialectically* it was to *act according to dialectics*.  Marx wrote in *Theses on Feuerbach* \u201cPhilosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.\u201d For them, it wasn't enough to study the nature of things, they sought to change the nature of things. They were both very politically active, and their praxis informed their theory. \n\nUnderstanding the contradictions within systems allows you to agitate against those contradictions and put forth into reality alternative ways of thinking, which in turn develops the ways of thinking of those in which you are directing your agitation towards. This process can be done in any context, it isn't simply about *thinking,* as I said. What is the point of writing a detailed and well reasoned critique of your boss or the job that you work at, if your goal isn't to *make change.*",

It was in Evald Ilyenkov\u2019s chapter on abstract and concrete in the same work I have referred to that we find an exposition of how once the germ cell is isolated, its further concretisation can be traced as it colonises, so to speak, all the other elements of the social formation, and in the process of merging with other relations the cell is itself modified, ultimately able to reproduce itself out of conditions which are its own creation. But as the germ cell develops, its inner contradiction, formerly enclosed by the relations it builds around itself, breaks out, and it is at this point that revolutionaries have the chance to determine the course of events.\"\n\nHowever the starting concept is a simple unit which contains within it the essential elements and development of a whole in some area. Basically, the starting point of analysis is fundamental to determine the paths of one's analysis and how accurate and developed it can be as opposed to one sided.  \n[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/chat/index.htm#unit](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/chat/index.htm#unit)  \n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/abstract/abstra1f.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/abstract/abstra1f.htm)  \n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/pilling/works/capital/pilling4.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/pilling/works/capital/pilling4.htm)\n\nAnd the reason is that if one doesn't identify a conctete universal, a particualr with the richness of what is universal to everything else, it lacks a logical and necessary connection to the development of everything else.  \nA great analogy for why analysis that are one sided fall into problems is in lev Vygotsky.  \n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/words/ch01.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/words/ch01.htm)\n\n\"The first of these forms of analysis begins with the decomposition of the complex mental whole into its elements. This mode of analysis can be compared with a chemical analysis of water in which water is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen. The essential feature of this form of analysis is that its products are of a different nature than the whole from which they were derived. The elements lack the characteristics inherent in the whole and they possess properties that it did not possess. When one approaches the problem of thinking and speech by decomposing it into its elements, one adopts the strategy of the man who resorts to the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen in his search for a scientific explanation of the characteristics of water, its capacity to extinguish fire or its conformity to Archimedes law for example. This man will discover, to his chagrin, that hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains combustion. He will never succeed in explaining the characteristics of the whole by analysing the characteristics of its elements. Similarly, a psychology that decomposes verbal thinking into its elements in an attempt to explain its characteristics will search in vain for the unity that is characteristic of the whole. These characteristics are inherent in the phenomenon only as a unified whole. When the whole is analysed into its elements, these characteristics evaporate. In his attempt to reconstruct these characteristics, the investigator is left with no alternative but to search for external, mechanical forms of interaction between the elements.\n\nSince it results in products that have lost the characteristics of the whole, this process is not a form of analysis in the true sense of that word.\"\n\nYou might be curious about Goethe's relationship to Hegel and thus Marx because through Hegel is a continuation of Goethe's gentle empiricism and his ecological perspective of finding what is essential about a thing within it's real world relations and not abstracted from them.  \n[https://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/How\\_Hegel\\_put\\_Goethe\\_s\\_Urphanomen\\_to\\_Phi.pdf](https://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/How_Hegel_put_Goethe_s_Urphanomen_to_Phi.pdf)",

            "body": "I like to think of dialectics in terms of 1), the classical dialectic of having a conversation and changing each others minds through it. Hegel and Marx depart from this foundation enormously, but I think it is the same sort of underlying framework.\n\nHegel took this dialectic and made it about the ideas of society shaping each other, rather than individuals talking to one another. Looking at the great intellectual and spiritual trends that had seized ahold of Europe, with the enlightenment, romanticism, the reformation, the French and American revolutions, etc, Hegel understood all of these great changes as forces confronting one another, and influencing each other, and thus remaking the world around them. In essence, they were in conversation or discourse with one another, with history (the continual transformation of humanity) as the overall result. \n\nYet this was also a mystical conception. In Hegel's view, all of history was one thing in a state of transformation towards a single universal ideal - what he called the Absolute Idea/Spirit, or God. \n\nMarx took this in a very different direction. He observed the vast changes in Europe and the world as being created by technological and social change, rather than intellectual. Transformation by steam, machine, factory, and great movements of people into the cities - this is his *materialism*. Rather than being driven by the forces of ideas and spirit, Marx's approach looks at the dialectic as being driven by social processes. \n\nSo in the materialist dialectic, people essentially converse with their conditions and each other - and in doing so each are transformed by the other. From the factory floor - where people turn raw materials into commodities - to the whole world - where nations and classes struggle against each other for survival or control - dialectical processes can be observed. In each case, this conversation cannot be carried out without each participant together. There's no worker without a workplace, no workplace without its workers. Again, history is the result, but it is the transformation of humanity in terms of their social relations, rather than their spirit. But the really revolutionary aspect of materialist dialectics (in my opinion) is that this conversation is not just done with words or ideas, but with action. History, especially, is the actions of the masses - but every single day, people act upon the world in their own \"conversations,\" through work, leisure, study... and in their own way they participate in the dialectics of material society.\n\nAction of any sort requires power - and power is a thing that exists between people. It makes no difference if that action is to change the world, or keep it going as it is. Hegel discusses this most directly in his Master/Bondsman dialectic - and Marx talks about classes, general relationships to production. Power must be taken up by the people if they want to liberate themselves (and transform their historic and material conditions). A dialectical approach recognises that those that want to change the world are also changed by the world - and indeed, by their own action. Marxists call this praxis - critique by action. \n\nSo materialist dialectics are all about praxis. They are a way of unravelling how conditions affect action, action affects conditions, and how that can be used to shape history. Thinking dialectically means acting, and acting dialectically means thinking.",

Unfortunately, the popularisation of dialectics has come with its distortions and simplifications. On top of this, it doesn't help that it is a highly contested theoretical concept.\n\nThe fundamental premise of dialectics is the internal contradiction. That is, the idea that the identity of a thing is inconsistent with itself. So the point of dialectics is to change Aristotle's principle of non-contradiction with its opposite: the principle of contradiction. So, whereas Aristotle believed an entity cannot be two different things at the same time in the same respect, dialectics finds that this is the case for all identities. For example, Aristotle would claim \"you are you; you cannot be you and, at the same time, someone else\". That is, there cannot be a contradiction in your identity as \"you\". A dialectician, however, would demonstrate how the self is constituted by the world outside this self. The very formation of the \"I\" happens only through an intersubjective relation. So this sense of \"self\" within me is actually foreign, external to myself. There is something within me that is more than me.\n\nSo, to answer your question, what does it mean to \"do dialectics\"? It means to look for the internal contradiction, the point at which an identity fails to be consistent with itself. Marx, for example, identified \"class struggle\" as the point where society fails to be a consistent totality (a consistent, non-contradictory Whole/One), where workers and capitalists can exist harmoniously. The very logic of capital leads to an inconsistency that causes crises, revolutions, fascist dicatorships, etc. All of these are attempts to overcome the internal contradictions of capital, the fact that capital isn't consistent with itself. Lenin, similarly, showed how the state arises also as an attempt to overcome this contradiction.\n\nSo, to do dialectics, the trick is to find what is apparently an opposition between two external entities (capitalists vs proletariats; nazis vs jews; israel vs hamas, etc) and identify how, in reality, what appears to be an opposition between \"two\" entities is in fact the contradiction of the one: proletariat arises from the contradictions of capital; israel's zionist project is forming its own hamas terrorists; the Nazis externalised their own internal crises and failures onto the external figure of the Jew, etc. And relevant for today, Democrats love to pretend Trump is an enemy that fell out from the sky, but his rise is entirely a symptom of the hegemonic neoliberal order that the Democrats have sustained for years, and its own failure is what gave rise to Trump. It's therefore not Trump versus the Democrats, but the Democrats versus themselves.\n\nThe point is to show *one* of these elements encompasses the other, and that the secondary element is usually a result or a symptom of the internal contradictions of the first one.",

I think dialectics has a very broad domain, but I'm skeptical about the idea that it can be used to understand absolutely everything and anything. I think it's useful when trying to understand relations (e.g. between self/other, particular/universal, materialism/idealism, language/reality, contingency/necessity, capitalist/worker, consciousness/unconscious, etc), as well as to understand each concept within the relation. But I don't think it could be applied to the concrete, specific ways in which a book is published, or why a team is bad one particular year. I could be wrong, though.\u00a0\n\n\nTo answer your second question, the explanation is largely from the writings of Hegel, later Marx, Lacan and \u017di\u017eek. It's not as popular because most people generally accept the easiest, most simplified form and it gives them some sense of understanding. At its worst, people think dialectics is the movement from thesis-antithesis-synthesis, which couldn't be further from the truth. Those more dedicated begin to talk about dialectics as a mode of understanding the interrelations and interdependence of things (how one thing affects the other) and in motion. They condemn the \"bourgeois\" way of thinking in static and abstract forms. But, really, doesn't the bourgeois world already think of things in motion and in their relations? Ever since Darwin published the Origin of Species, this mode of thinking has been the basis of bourgeois ideology. There is no difference between a Marxist and Richard Dawkins, if this were the case.\n\n\nIn any case, thinking of relations, motion and interdependence gets closer to dialectics than the thesis-antithesis nonsense does. I think the missing step is to emphasise the internal contradiction. If you're looking for more of this interpretation (dialectics as focusing on contradiction), Todd McGowan published a book on Hegel that is very good, although I forgot the title (Hegel After the Revolution?).\u00a0",

I\u2019m not going to delete it because there\u2019s value in the reply someone made to it.\n\n\u2026 \n\n\nDialectics is usually just a term they throw around to say they\u2019re right. Dialects itself explains and proves nothing. Dialectics is a method of finding the truth. Dialectical materialism holds as an axiom that all was spawned from the material world. Ideas are influenced by our environment, and those ideas then go on to shape our environment.\n\nThe dialectical materialist method is about an analysis of things from their root to their broadest strokes. Analysing the interplay between different elements of society. Everything in some way affects everything else. Marx used this method in Capital to first analyse the smallest unit of capitalism, the commodity, to the broadest strokes of capitalism, class struggle, imperialism (though later theorists expanded on this), etc.\n\nYou can abstract the dialectical approach by thinking of it in literary terms. Within fiction story writing, when creating a character arc you\u2019ll often have to ask a couple of questions about a protagonist and an antagonist.\n\nWhat is it the protagonist wants and what is it the antagonist wants. Then, what is it they actually need and how does that differ from what they think they want. How can the knowledge gained from their opposing worldviews be synthesised into a more perfect worldview.\n\nMarx described the worldview of the bourgeois and the worldview of the proletarian. The class struggle interplay between these two groups. He described how the capitalist is forced by economic competition to lower the living standard of the working class among many other laws of motion of capitalism. The worker, conversely, must unionise, strike, damage the means of production, or seek the aid of political parties to increase their wage to gain enough to eat and pay rent.\n\nThe synthesis between these two diametrically opposed material interests is the abolition of class and the transference of capital into socially owned means of production held in common by all.\n\nTo apply this to Russia and Ukraine, for example, we must ask what are the conflicting things that these two countries want, what are they materially incentivised to do, and what is a solution that can take both material interests into account to create a more perfect solution. I would argue stateless communism would be the answer, though the dialectical method does not necessarily need to lead to the same conclusion by every user of it.",
