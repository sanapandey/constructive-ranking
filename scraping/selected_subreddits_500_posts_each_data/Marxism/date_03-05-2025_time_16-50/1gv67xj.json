    "selftext": "As I get deeper into different Marxist perspectives and theories, I have run across the concept of the lumpenproletariat, which I understand to mean people who are divorced from the means of production or don't have access to the squeeze on profits a worker's strike or revolt can produce. I am currently unemployed due to developing some fairly severe medical issues that have disabled me. I do understand (kind of) some of class struggle and Marxist theory and I am continuing to do my reading, but I am running into this issue in organizing in my community. I do have opportunities to join local groups for mutual aid and political action, am I incapable of organizing in that way due to being lumpenproletariat? Due to my disability am I of any value to the effort, or are my organizing efforts inherently going to fail due to me being part of a class that cannot be mobilized?",

I have a significant other who suffers from severe depression due to an abusive childhood. Due to this- they actually can't work. They just can't hold down a job (annoyingly, they could work, but the scheduling demands of low level jobs are not friendly to their fluxuations in their ability to perform). Luckily- they have me, and I do what I can to take care of both of us. But if I wasn't around- I sincearly fear for what would become of them. (They were actually homeless for a month when they were 17. I convinced my parents to let them live with us til we moved out for college).\n\n\nBut in a socialist society- it would be understood that some people just can't work as hard as others. Such things wouldn't become so dire. If my parents didn't accept my SO into out home- they would no doubt be homeless or worse. To me, this is a massive failure of the system.",

            "body": "Ugh... The currently in-vogue identity based radicalism has a lot to answer for.\n\nMarxism is not a form of idpol for workers, if anything it is the complete anthesis of such ideologies given the whole point of the political struggle is to supersede the social conditions which create class relations, it is not about affirming one's right to express their nature as a worker. Being a worker is not some inherent characteristic of an individual person, in that respect it's completely different to other radical social movements like feminism, black power, decolonisation and so on. I'm not commenting on the merits of those movements either however it's extremely misleading conceptualise class as an axis of oppression in the way intersectional theorists like to do.\n\nMarxism has always distinguished itself from ideas like anarcho-syndicalism in that it stands for the creation of a proletarian political party which gathers communists under the leadership of a single revolutionary organisation and doctrine, as opposed to anarcho-syndicalism which conflates political organisation (i.e. organisations based on common political outlook) with economic organisations like trade unions where membership is based purely on one's class position. Unions are defensive organisations, as Lenin summised such economic organisations are incapable of moving beyond their limited interests as a group within capitalist civil society, this is been born out time and again where unions can both express high levels of spontaneous solidarity and militancy while pursuing outright conservative policies purely because they benefit their membership as an economic interest group within capitalism, rather than a historical-class which has united in a common struggle against capitalism. Union support for the imperialist slaughter of WWI and WWII, opposition to immigration due to their use by capital as cheap labour in the imperialist centres (often accompanied by barely concealed racism), even outright racist strikes in places like South Africa and the southern US opposing the hiring of non-white workers, not to mention sexism, corruption and organised crime infiltration, stand-over tactics and kickbacks for bureaucrats, collaboration with every sort of bourgeois party, and so on and so forth.\n\nI'm not trying to shit on unions, they are necessary defensive organisations, however anyone with experience in the union movement should be fairly familiar with all the issues I mentioned above (and it's important to note that Marx was never shy about denouncing as traitors all those labour leaders that pursue these backwards policies), the point is that being a worker as an individual is meaningless and does not make you revolutionary. Even large collections of workers within trades, industries, regions or countries are not revolutionary organisations *so long as they are not yet conscious of the internationalist nature of the class struggle.* Those individuals - be they wage-labourers or not - are communists, they are who comprise the basis of the revolutionary party, and that is why our two founding theorists weren't proletarians at all: Marx was a d\u00e9class\u00e9 intellectual who never held down a real job in his life, while Engels was bourgeois to the core. Yet these they had the gaul to denounce many a 'genuine' proletarian, and to proclaim themselves as the nucleus of the genuine proletarian party regardless. Why? Because their theory was right, because the working class cannot liberate itself without class consciousness, and communism is no more than the distillation of class consciousness into a political theory, from which organisation, strategy and tactics can be developed on a proper revolutionary basis.\n\nOn a practical level, interrogating people's class background is a pointless exercise, because first of all plenty of workers are munters, bigots, cowards, traitors and generally shit people, we're talking about a global class who's only point of commonality is their relation to capital. Furthermore in reality most of us have messy class backgrounds, there's no clear dividing line between workers, petit-capitalists and lumpen proles, many of us move between all three classes over the course of our lifetimes and socially our family and community networks represent all sorts of sources of income. This isn't new either, even during the time of the Russian Revolution, a lot of workers were first generation proletarians who would return to their peasant villages when work was scarce. These days people have investments, they rent out rooms or houses, they sell drugs, sell content on onlyfans or spend long periods on governments benefits, while also working for a wage much of the time. \n\nThe motto of communism is 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs', as in work is distributed fairly and equally amongst the population, while in return all receive free access to all of society's wealth according to their needs, and this is made possible by capitalism's massive mobilisation of social labour which has made it possible to reduce deprivation and toil to a rational minimum. So no one would be judged for being unable to work due to an illness or injury, there would be no ideology praising the value of work for its own sake, quite the opposite. Work is to be reduced to a rational minimum, production for production's sake is an illness of capitalist society that debases the producers and is now drowning our own planet in pollution, communism is a revolt against life as a worker not its affirmation as some sort of supreme moral good. That goes for the struggle too, we can't afford to waste valuable resources by being judgemental of a person's background, judge them by what they do and say rather than by who their parents are, where their money comes from or whether they're sufficiently 'productive' in this world of absurd overproduction.",

He was also partially disabled (he had a bad arm that never healed right from a horse cart accident), so you\u2019re in good company, comrade.",
