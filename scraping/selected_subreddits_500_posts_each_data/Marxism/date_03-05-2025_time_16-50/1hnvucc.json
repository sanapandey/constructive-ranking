    "selftext": "Seeing purely right wing arguments and narratives got somewhat annoying, so I wrote a bit of information about this topic.\n\n# Why do companies want H-1B workers?\n\nIf an H-1B worker loses their job, they must find a job in 60 days to remain in the country. Since tech jobs take a long time to find and interview for, this effectively means that H1-B tech workers are deported upon termination.\n\nThe ability to deport workers \"at-will\" by firing them is like crack cocaine for capitalists. They work less than 80 hours a week? Deported. They join a union? Deported. They refuse to follow unethical business practices? Deported. They resist against verbal, physical, or sexual abuse? Deported.\n\nOn top of this, due to low pay in the worker's home country, H-1B workers can be paid less as well.\n\nIt is a no-brainer for capitalists, and is primarily guided by their desire for power over the working class. It has nothing to do with \u201cDEI\u201d, \"woke HR departments\u201d, conspiracies about Jews, \"white genocide\" or any of the other typical right wing delusions.\n\n# How H-1B workers reduce American workers\u2019 pay.\n\nThe right wing narrative about pay is that assisting the poor/lower class in any way results in reduced pay and quality of life for the middle and upper class because middle and upper class skilled workers will be the ones paying for it.\n\nThe reality is the exact opposite of that: In a highly competitive labor market where capitalists have leverage over workers via ownership of the means of production, the most desperate job applicants set the wages.\n\nAs a result, providing assistance to the most desperate applicants increases the pay across the board. Safety nets such as unemployment insurance, medical insurance, and food stamps/assistance ensure that an unemployed worker has time to search for a fair wage instead of accepting a lowball offer.\n\n# Internationalism\n\nThis is also why leftists are internationalist. Quality of life improvements in India and other countries will reduce opportunities for outsourcing American labor. Intelligent labor unions and left wing political parties support each other across borders because they understand this.\n\nWhile the recent \\~50 yr reduction in American quality of life can be primarily attributed to imperialist spending on the cold war, handouts to the rich, imperialism turning inward, and capitalism in general, another large part of this change was the fall of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union showed Americans an alternative to capitalism, and forced the enemy American government to meet or exceed the Soviet Union\u2019s standard of living to avoid the spread of militant socialist sentiment. When there are no alternatives to capitalism, capitalists have free rein.\n\nWhen Indians are easily exploited, Americans are easily exploited as well. Unlike China, India does not have a ruling socialist party to protect its workers and move the country towards improvements of worker pay and quality of life over the long term. Their government is also far more right wing than America\u2019s, and effectively uses divide-and-conquer tactics to distract and suppress worker resistance.\n\n# Side note: Isolationist policies\n\nSome conservatives and liberals may think that the solution here is isolationist policies to avoid competition with countries with cheaper labor. Although there are various issues with this, the primary misunderstanding here is about who is in charge in America: the capitalists. Our government works in the interests of the rich, and will not stop outsourcing just because the workers are unhappy with it, unless there is a risk of militant leftist and union opposition.\n\nSome portions of the MAGA right and the tech worker community are learning this now after being betrayed by the tech capitalist and corporate elite. Ideally, they would recognize their working class position and move to the left to fight against capitalist exploitation. Unfortunately, considering that American divide and conquer tactics are top-notch, tech workers and the MAGA right will probably move further from reality and develop more white supremacist and fascist beliefs instead.\n\n# Solutions to the H-1B issue\n\nIf the H-1B program continues to exist, H-1B workers must be given protection from their employer via a longer grace period or a different mechanism for deportation.\n\nWhy hire a highly paid worker when you can have a slave? Employers love the system as is. Cutting off their power over H-1B workers will increase worker power and pay across the board.\n\nAlternatively, reduce the number of H1-B workers. The right wing loves this for typical right wing (white supremacist) reasons. The left wing has varying arguments about it. Some try to side with the international working class and say that all workers have a right to these jobs, regardless of their birth country. Others say that it is brain drain to take high quality workers from poorer countries and that this is another form of imperialism.\n\nIn my opinion, the topic is somewhat academic as there is no point in trying to convince the American working class to work against their own interests for the sake of the global working class. They simply will not do it regardless of if it is the right or moral thing to do, and usually aren't even willing to work towards any working class interests at all, regardless of country. It is mainly an educational topic, ie. something for leftists to discuss to get a better understanding of Marxism and left-wing economic theories.\n\n# \u201cLow-trust society,\u201d a natural and inevitable result of capitalism.\n\nThere is also a broad right wing frustration with corruption, insecurity, and inefficiency, which unfortunately drowns out any left wing arguments about the subjects. The complaints are related to \"low-trust society\", MBAs, crime, etc.\n\nThe right wing may think that Indians are genetically predisposed to this, which is obviously nonsense. The reality is that \"low-trust society\" is the natural result of capitalism, individualism, and strategy of tension. America will naturally tend in this direction even if they do not \"import\" Indian capitalist and individualist culture.\n\nUnder a capitalist competitive market, companies and individuals who are not ruthless, exploitative, and willing to bend the rules will eventually lose out to companies who are.\n\nWhen you remove the nostalgia the right has, you will realize this has been happening for centuries. But if we look at more recent events, there have been some that shifted the culture greatly, specifically the 2008 global financial crisis. Big banks and bankers effectively getting off scot free taught Americans that there was no point in playing by the rules. This probably had a much bigger effect on corporate culture than many people realize.\n\n# Monopoly Capitalism\n\nAmerican monopolists contribute further to this degradation of society. Monopolist companies that extract superprofits are able to ignore internal corruption, embezzlement, etc. without collapsing since they have no competitors.\n\nThe result is that MBAs can sacrifice long term gains to take credit for perceived short term improvement, brown-nosers and political operatives can manipulate and ladder-climb their way to the top, corrupt employees can embezzle money, hire their friends, sell access to positions, etc. Basically a bunch of variations of the [principal agent problem](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp).\n\n# Venture Capitalism\n\nVenture capitalists make new companies monopolies by default. The \"leading\" companies in \"competitive\" markets today can be horribly inefficient and unprofitable because they are all running on VC money.\n\nLandlords leach as much tech worker salary as they can, tech workers brown nose in tech companies with absurd amounts of funding for high salaries, CEOs sell fantasies to clueless VCs, slightly less clueless VCs make backroom deals with founders to funds disappear into their own bank accounts, adding to the percentage fees they take from the total.\n\nNone of these are examples of an efficient market, an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d, or a \"high-trust society\", but the typical right winger that jokes about communists not understanding economics is blind to the inefficiency caused by this capitalist economic planning.\n\n# Rent-Seeking\n\nWhy are these investors so desperate to make these tech companies? Because they want a chance to form a monopoly that can put a tax on entire markets.\n\nThink about social media. Yes, it is a lot of fun scrolling, but is it really worth allocating trillions of dollars to? Does it really take trillions of dollars of valuation to make a glorified database and recommendation system? An inexperienced tech worker might say yes, because they are so deep into the lie, but those that truly understand tech will realize it does not. Their valuations are in the trillions because they have access to customer's attention, which they sell via advertising. **Their multi-billion-dollar profits do not come from their own productivity, but from the productivity of their advertising customers**. Their own productivity is minimal, but when they can tax nearly every productive company on earth, it does not matter.\n\nVirtually every exciting and \"innovative\" part of the tech industry involves finding a new way to leech off of actually productive companies and workers. An absurd portion of American investment is being put into creating middlemen rather than physical products and scientific research. Robotics? Semiconductors? Material science? Why do that when you can create an app? Pure software tech startups definitely do add some value, but the current situation does not give the perception of a \"high-trust society\", especially when rent-seeking and middleman companies are the most rewarded.\n\nThis is all the result of monopolies and bad economic planning. Capitalism is tending towards monopolized and socialized production approaches, while giving absolute power and \"freedom\" to the capitalists that own these monopolies. What a surprise.\n\n# \u201cHigh-Trust\u201d America\n\nThe difference between \"high-trust\" America and \"low-trust\" India, Russia, and China has a lot more to do with America's temporary economic lead than any temporary ethical or legal difference between these countries. Even the differences that exist are decreasing every day.\n\nThe landlord wants as much of your wage and your company's profits as they can take. The food, grocery, and household product-related companies want as much as you can afford to spend. The hospitals and insurance companies will happily save your life in exchange for your slavery. The capitalist government politicians and figureheads want your taxes, education, safety net, and infrastructure, because the defense industry isn't happy with only $700 billion. The army wants your life, because the oil industry, the [car industry](https://x.com/panoparker/status/1318157559266762752), and even the [pistachio industry](https://beirut-today.com/2020/01/08/capital-oil-pistachios-america-iran/) want the superprofits that can be extracted via imperialism. We live in a vast, multilayered, and interconnected world, with each group snatching as much of our labor as they can get their hands on.\n\nWe are \"high-trust\" because we are currently affluent and not yet desperate. This will inevitably change over time, as the \"inflation\" (multilayered price gouging and profit taking) wears people and companies down.\n\nWorkers create all value, and yet hold almost none of it. Until these workers recognize that they are being robbed, they will continue to be robbed more and more, and there is nothing high-trust about that.\n\n# Strategy of Tension\n\nWe can not talk about \"low-trust society\" without talking about the strategy of tension.\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension):\n\n>\"A strategy of tension (Italian: strategia della tensione) is a political policy wherein violent struggle is encouraged rather than suppressed. The purpose is to create a general feeling of insecurity in the population and make people seek security in a strong government\"\n\nI won't go too into detail as it is out of scope, but this really kicked off after the George Floyd protests. American police departments effectively [refused to do their job](https://www.propublica.org/article/what-can-mayors-do-when-the-police-stop-doing-their-jobs) in retaliation for the resistance against them. They force Americans to choose: either give police complete power and do not resist their violent and dictatorial actions whatsoever, or live in a lawless city/state/country.\n\nIt is a false choice of course, but since American police forces act more like gangs than a military (loyal to themselves, not the country or constitution), Americans are stuck with this choice.\n\nThere is a line between unethical and illegal, and normally people stay very far away from that line. When laws are not strictly enforced, people go further into unethical and illegal territory than they normally would, towards a \u201clow-trust\u201d, unproductive, and dangerous society.",

            "body": "I find all this high trust, low trust stuff a bit of a distraction with a whiff of what I'd call \"Pew Research Centre ethnonationalism\", which usually looks like the claim that if your country is not 1980s Norway demographically (or choose your preferred historical aquarium), it will experience a suboptimal rate of GDP growth.\n\nThis style of argument about \"social cohesion\" goes along with a range of contestable premises about the causes of variable prosperity during this era of ongoing economic globalisation. But it's not the basic argument anyway. \n\nSo what is the basic \"leftist\" argument against migrant labour? It's usually the protectionist, left nationalist claim that migrant labour suppresses wages.\n\nBut is this true? It depends on your premises and broader analytical framework. \n\nThe claim is put forward on national terms: it refers to the suppression of the wages of citizen workers. \n\nThere are substantial critiques of the claim on these terms. \n\nGoing further, from an international viewpoint, migrants originating in a poorer economy, or an economy in which there is a surplus of labour, and arriving in a richer economy where they obtain work, will usually increase aggregate average wages across the combined origin and destination economies. Migrants migrate for higher wages.\n\nThe claim migrant labour suppresses wages only stands if we restrict ourselves to consideration of the wages of citizen workers to the exclusion of both migrant workers and workers overseas.\n\nThese are properly questions of geography, politics and power: is the \"leftist\" objective to prop up a strictly national workers' movement at the expense of international solidarity, or is it to build an international workers' movement?\n\nSome might say there's a pragmatic need to focus on local, or national power and prospects, but since production itself is now distributed across borders, it's hard to see how a worker's movement can disrupt, regulate or seize production if it is not international.",

            "body": "Honestly I'd be fine with H1-B if we closed the loophole that lets big employers hire people as \"contractors\" thru talent sourcing firms, but meanwhile this \"contractor\" works 100% of the time just for the big employer, they are managed by an employee of the big employer, who sets their schedule and dictates everything they do. It's an employer-employee relationship, however the person is really not their employee and so gets no legal rights regarding that relationship. The talent sourcing agency (who is their actual employer) makes them sign away all their rights, basically saying they agree that if the contract ends, they're still employed but will receive no pay.\n\nIt's horrible. Meanwhile state employment departments make millions by suing small businesses who pay some people as contractors that might loosely in some arcane legal precedent qualify as employers despite working from home, setting their own schedules, buying their own equipment, and working multiple contracts simultaneously.",
