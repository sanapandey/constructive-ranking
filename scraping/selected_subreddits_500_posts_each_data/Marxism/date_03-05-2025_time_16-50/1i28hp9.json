Im looking for something easy to read but that will still give me a strong understanding of the basics. \n\nI'm curious to see if the notion of the reserve army of labour ties in to David Graeber's ideas of bullshit jobs, so bonus points if it speaks to this.",

I think you\u2019ll love it. Further down the line, you may even check out his texts on urbanisation, which opened a new eye for me. \n\nFor your other request, if I\u2019ve correctly understood what you meant, you are looking for a \u2018history of Marxist political thought\u2019 book. I do not know a book that handles the Marxist literature in a historical manner, but I would love to check it out if anyone could recommend.",

But I think there's a lot of potential to read and expand on Bullshit Jobs through a communist perspective and I'd really like to explore that angle.",

                            "body": "I'm wary of the whole premise of 'bullshit jobs', it reminds me of the communisation milieu in that I find it heavily Eurocentric, with the idea being that essentially the productive forces are so developed as to enable an immediatist approach to economic transition. A basic Marxist view is that western economies have transitioned to service jobs and gig economy type of work because manufacturing has generally been transferred to developing countries where primitive accumulation only began in the last half century or so, providing a cheap labour force of first or second generation proletarians that are still in their infancy in terms of political organisation and class consciousness. Obviously this process was a response to the militancy of the western labour movement and multiple class offensives in the 60s and 70s coinciding with the post-war economic boom hitting its limit due to the declining rate of profit.\n\nGraeber can be enjoyable to read, I liked his book on the history of debt, but its very superficial pop-culture theory and its noteworthy that he treats these specific aspects of the modern economy as representing fundamentally important new trends in the system. During the debt crisis in Greece he released his book on debt, now that gig-economy work is the big new thing thanks to Uber, and no doubt in 5 years he'll have uncovered some other profoundly new economic tendency to analyse in a similarly exaggerated manner.\n\nI just dislike this tendency to treat new ideas as inherently superior or even revolutionary (which is a distinctly petit-bourgeois outlook and therefore endemic amongst academics). The basic axioms of Marxism provide use with sufficient theoretical tools, all that's required is to apply them with sufficient skill and insight that we can actually say something useful for ourselves as scientists and as a political cause which presumes to be the vanguard of the working class cause.",

Instead, I would advise you to read Antiduhring for the clearest statement of the Marxist socialist/communist project, and Value, Price and Profit for a short introduction to the Marxist criticism of political economy.",
