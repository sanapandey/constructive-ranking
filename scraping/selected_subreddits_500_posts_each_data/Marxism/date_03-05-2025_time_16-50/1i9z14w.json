    "selftext": "He certainly wasn't my political cup of tea, but his party (the CPGB ML) was of a significance of sorts on the UK left. Having been aligned to various bodies (the Indian Workers' Association, the Stalin Society, and, somewhat unhappily, with the Socialist Labour Party), they ended up providing most of the organisation for by ex Labour MP George Galloway when he formed the politically \"unusual\" Workers' Party of Britain.",

I've heard about it but I don't know details, I don't know why they would support him\n\nRIP",

The CPGB ML provided almost all the initial organisational muscle to get it going (I presume they thought this was some kind of viable non Labour left project). Joti Brar was \"Deputy Leader\" for some time if I remember rightly.\n\nBut... Galloway isn't a Marxist, even though he knows all the magic words to speak. He's someone who now more naturally plays communal politics, especially in Muslim communities, and he's also able to surf the \"anti woke\" fashion in working class white ones, I assume because he's a relatively socially conservative Catholic. He's also allowed some figures who (to their credit) the CPGB ML would be deeply uncomfortable with on to platforms with him.\n\nSo... They fell out. I think the CPGB ML eventually took the decision that the Workers' Party wasn't for them, simply because in reality class politics isn't often the real driving force of its successes.",
