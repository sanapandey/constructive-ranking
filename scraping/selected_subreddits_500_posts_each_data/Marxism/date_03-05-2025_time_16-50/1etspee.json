I disagree with the liberal and anarchist critiques of the USSR, but I think it\u2019s inescapable that at some point things started to go downhill.\n\nI think (but I could be wrong) that\u2019d we all agree Lenin did a very good job with what he had. Did it all go downhill as soon as Stalin came to power? Around the war? With Kruschev? The Sino-Soviet split?\n\nEssentially, my opinion is that the USSR started in the 20s as fundamentally good and ended in the 90s as not only corrupt and oppressive but also just a failed state. In my opinion the corruption and oppression started during the 30s but really came to head after Stalin\u2019s death.\n\nWhat do you folks think?",

Zubok. \n\nThe book mostly challenges the notion that the collapse was entirely or even mostly due to outside forces, insisting that most of the instability came from within. \n\nSummarizing what I\u2019ve learned so far, the USSR struggled with a lot internal issues exacerbated by poor leadership, especially by the time Gorbachev came along. He didn\u2019t focus nearly enough on economic reform and didn\u2019t abide by the  core political principles that the USSR was founded on. The USSR was essentially stuck in an over-bloated war economy and needed to pivot into alternative sustainable sectors post-war. He also let Baltic nationalist sentiments run wild to the point of fragmentation. But this is very a brief summarization.",

Problem is communism doesnt work because the nature of people.  Someone will always rise to the top and screw everything over because they love power and use the system to get that power, and after they gain it they will see the country just as slaves and treat them so. That corruption trickles down the system because it gives those that are very corrupt the ability to easily get power.",

(which made up a lot about oppression, which you mentioned) \n\nThrough my own studies, the reason for collapse was due to direct western influence in the socialist world, including CIA insurgencies in countries such as Poland and Romania (plus many more), that caused instability, which the USA took advantaged of. \n\nThe Gorbachev factor is also a big one with the liberalisation of the soviet economy which pretty much made the ussr run out of money. \n\nSide note: the dissolution of the union was not democratic and the majority of people did not hold this opinion. \n\nThe ussr provided a substantial standard of living for the overwhelmingly majority of people. Nothing went \u2018wrong\u2019 per se because of the achievements of socialism compared to capitalist countries (see study below).\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2430906/\n\nOf course there were mistakes in this socialist experiment, however, they achieved many things which improved the life\u2019s of the soviet people.",

No country has made as much progress in thirty years as Russia from 1921-1951, and the very decent second is probably China, another socialist country.\n\nThat said, you can\u2019t say there weren\u2019t inherent flaws baked into the Soviet government by the postwar period. I understand Stalin was not sending everyone whose haircut he didn\u2019t like to the gulag but there were a lot of wrongful deaths due to one man\u2019s ridiculous paranoia. I\u2019m not generally anti-Stalin, particularly pre war Stalin, but he was extremely volatile and just kind of insane towards the end. Stalin should not have had as much power as he did, even if much of it was presumed and socially influenced power and not constitutionally given.\n\nAlso, was there not a marked negative difference in the material standard of living from say the 70s to the 90s? We can debate the actual numbers, but it\u2019s undeniable that there was extreme hyperinflation in the late 80s and early 90s. Such a marked increase even from 1990 to 1991 has to be due to government inaction if not caused by the government itself.",

Most nations were annexed into the USSR, nations in which the majority of people didn't want socialism, even if that is to their loss. Now, I am not saying that spreading the revolution and liberating workers from other nations is bad, but you really got to keep in mind that, i repeat, most nations were NOT brought into the USSR by their full own accord, and some of them kept their distrustful and rebelious thinking even up to the 90's.  \nThat doesn't mean that the USSR did not benefit them, especially in terms of quality of life, but at the end of the day they still wanted to be on their own and not controlled by Russia (which was kind of true since the USSR was dominated by russian leadership and influence, and let's not forget even colonisation during Stalin's time).  \nSo while a referendum might seem like a total majority union-wide, there were some republics which did not make up the majority that wanted the hell out, especially the Baltics, and some republics even boycotted that referendum.  \nYour whole comment seems like it was ripped straight out of a Hakim video, which i watch rigorously even tho they seem really biased and even uninformed sometimes if it's about historical issues.  \nThe same with the argument about Romania. As a Romanian, yes the CIA might have had something to do with the coup d'etat that followed an ACTUAL revolution of the people but you can't reduce everything to \"CIA Insurgency\" because it is waaay more complex than that. Ceausescu was an incompetent nationalist cuck either way and the people revolted against him and his autocratic regime, revolt which was hijacked by a group of people which coincidentally were former PCR members and this group of people in front with Iliescu destroyed everything socialism built. Sadly most of the revolutionaries were indeed anti-socialist as a whole, but if you search up the Proclamation/Declaration of actual revolutionaries from Timisoara you'll see that they rejected western capitalism, even though they wanted privatisation which in my humble opinion is idiotic.  \nThe imposed socialist regime had around 40 years at their disposal to properly educate the citizens of Romania on why capitalism is shit and why socialism is what they should all strive for. And they just fucked it up and left it to fake parades, propaganda and modified history which evidently did not work. It also did not help that the state was hijacked by Ceausescu when it seemed to go on the right path in the 60s-70s.  \nAnd as for Poland i am not informed enough, but please make your own research don't just regurgitate other's opinions. I certainly don't proclaim that i know the absolute truth because i don't but things are usually more complex and nuanced than just \"Gorbachov fucked it up it was perfect!\" or \"Romania fell because of the CIA!\"",

Which is, in short, their economy isn't very socialist/command.\n\n\nAnd then we come to the small matter of the murders. Don't talk about the murders. \"The USSR was great for its people\" yeah aside from several of the largest massacres in world history and the untold suffering of enormous groups of minorities.

Leaders tend to be promoted for their ability to be ruthless and win.  The oppressive elements of the previous regime tend to be reemployed in the same kind of job designed to control populations, just with a different employer.  And it's very hard to get away from this, because the whole country could have completely fallen apart and degraded into complete lawlessness and catastrophe.\n\nStalin did greatly industralize with his 5 year plans.  There were also failures such as famine and his internal oppression.  I think if WW2 didn't happen there would have been a very different trajectory.  I vaguely remembering a report post war from Russian generals that there were plans to remove Stalin and get back closer to core socialist principles, but during the invasion there was no room for any dissent so they had to keep all opressive structures and try to survive/win.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the destruction inflicted on the USSR in WW2.  Close to 17% of the population dead, devastated cities, decreased industrial capacity.  They tried to help themselves to all equipment in their occupied countries, but it was a nearly destroyed country.  This is compared to the US who emerged far better and through their post WW2 institutions had a huge control of the world economy.\n\nThen the cold war happened, which aside from some proxy conflicts, was primarily an economic war where the US used all its institutions to hurt the Soviets.  The USSR didn't really want the cold war to happen, but they had to protect themselves as best as they could.  Even now we gloss over the damage caused by economic warfare.  Venezuela was incredibly hurt by sanctions and the US and London confiscating billions, but news reports it as bad decisions by Maduro.  (ie he didn't let the US do what it wanted)\n\nWhen you're trying to analyse an entire system, it's near impossible to separate the system from the various forms of warfare done to it by hostile states.",

As things stood in 1985, there were certainly underlying problems that needed to be addressed, but the Soviet system was by no means in a crisis. However, Gorbachev's specific actions point to the USSR being \"murdered\" more than some underlying failure. Without those specific actions Gorbachev took, I think it's possible if not probably the USSR would have had time to appropriately work out those problems, certainly with the right leadership in the CPSU.\n\nOf course pinning the blame all on Gorbachev is not only overly simplistic and unsatisfying, it's also wrong. In the USSR, there was always a thread of opportunism, going back to Bukharin. In this opportunist vein, under Khrushchev, the USSR made a number of policy changes that allowed for the creation of a \"second economy\" - one that operated outside of the socialist economy. This economy took both legal and illegal forms (and gray areas inbetween). This second economy created an entire social base that saw socialism as an impediment to their material potential. It included farmers with private plots, black market \"entrepreneurs\", government officials who benefited directly or indirectly from this activity, and even professionals like journalists, academic, doctors, etc who saw what their counterparts were earning in the west and resented the relative equality they had with bricklayers, store clerks, etc. This social base allowed Gorbachev to act how he did. Without this social base, Gorbachev would never have been able to make the suicidal moves that he did.\n\nThis is all a (poor) summary, the book goes into much better detail.",

I think its a mistake that it is considered to be a \"collapse\".

It was really bad for a lot of them, Ukraine in particular. They made a lot of progress, but it came at a great human cost unfortunately. The irony of the Soviet Union is that things would be a lot better for them, and the world for a whole, if they had stuck to the Soviet system, but I think the rivalry with Western powers and a desire to not be seen as \"backwards\" led them to unfortunately emulate some of the worst aspects of their foes.\n\nAs far as Marxist states, I don't really get why people are so obsessed with the USSR, as its probably the biggest example of communism going wrong and then eventually becoming the worst version of capitalism. Like, Vietnam and Cuba are actual success stories, and actually still exist today. Cuba is a small state that has faced economic warfare from the West, while managing to reform a lot of the problems in their society still and have a world-class education and healthcare system.

Workers took control of factories and ruled them via elected committees. Peasants did similar, occupying the land of feudal lords.\n\nThe Bolsheviks promulgated that these processes should be the basis of the new order, and thus were chosen by the masses to lead the Soviets in confrontation with the remnants of the old order in the Constituent Assembly. Lenin and Trotsky recognized the opportunity and lead the party to take power.\n\nThey inherited a collapsed system of shortages and war and external pressures. Revolutions in other countries were not successful. How were they to manage this?\n\nThe Bolshevik answer was to take more direct command away from proletarian democracy and rule themselves in its name. Elected factory committees were replaced by appointed one-man management. Soviets were represented by bolsheviks. Strikes were put down by force. Grain was forcibly requisitioned from the peasants. The Bolsheviks could argue that these measures were forced upon them to solve the shortfalls.\n\nWas there another way? There were other revolutionary voices. The Kronstadt sailors rose up in sympathy for the 20-21 strike wave and had demands for 'soviets without bolsheviks' - but not a reversal of the soviets themselves. The Workers Opposition within the Bolshevik Party argued against the merging of party and state and the resulting bureaucracy and for the implementation of the 1919 bolshevik program that the unions should run the economy instead of the state. We don't know if these alternatives could have solved the issues confronting the working class of the former Russian empire.\n\nThe result was that the Bolsheviks reversed the privations of the war and economic collapse. Ruling in the name of the proletariat, the workers could expect better conditions. But the bureaucracy that the Workers Opposition warned against was the ruling class, not the workers themselves.",

Even though it failed, and had an abominable human rights record, the USSR delivered enormous quality of life improvements from peasantry to a modern working class. They defeated the Third Reich!

Without this, the party class begins to monopolize power amongst themselves, and this is what allows revisionism to take hold. \n\nThe preeminence of the state in a socialist society attracts careerists and the self-interested, because they understand that the power they seek can only be obtained through the state apparatus itself.

And they were surrounded by hostile powers. So they had to develop in the worst way possible, full speed, damn the torpedoes.\n\nThe thing about needing to survive in the immediate is that it is generally contrary to the long term. Obviously if you don't survive the short term, there's no long term possible, but if you can't plan for the long term, you will simply be going from crisis to crisis, with things never resolved, just managed.\n\nThis isn't optimal conditions for the development of democracy, and so a bureaucratic caste grew, and opportunists quickly realized this was the place to be if you wanted food, good apartments, women, etc. By the late 1920s, the government was thoroughly corrupt, top to bottom. \n\nThis process had started even during the Civil War. The Bolsheviks had hoped that if the Revolution spread to Germany, that access to cheap manufactured good from a socialist Germany would help curb the problems that arise from scarcity. But the war in Poland, to bring the revolution to Germany's doorstep failed due to Stalin and Budyony refusing to follow orders to guard Tukhachevsky's flank.\n\nThese problems would have existed no matter whether Lenin had lived, if Trotsky or Bukharin had succeeded him, if Kirov had been allowed to win the election, whether the Nazis invaded or not. As long as the revolution didn't spread, it was doomed to degenerate, and ultimately fail. \n\nIt might have been less murdery, less people might have died of famine, maybe Great Russian chauvinism wouldn't have been pushed down everyone's throats and the other nations treated respectfully, less genocide of Crimeans, Volga Germans, Chechn's, and Dagestanis, but it was still doomed as long as the revolution failed to spread.",

As the founder and leader of the Red Army, Trotsky was probably the single person most responsible for making sure the USSR didn't go the way of the Paris Commune.\n\n'Socialism in one country' wasn't actually about building a base from which to spread the Revolution, something Lenin and Trotsky always supported. It was a right-wing revision to Marxism which said that building the USSR was *more* important than the World Revolution. To this end, the bureaucracy sabotaged the revolutions potentials in Germany (somewhat in 1923 and certainly in 1933), China (1927)  and Spain (1936). In the latter two cases, they literally armed the liberals as they massacred the communists.\n\nIn contrast, the Bolshevik-Leninist faction, led by Trotsky, always fought to preserve the gains of the October Revolutions. They fought for industrialisation long before Stalin was forced to adopt it to save the USSR from counter-revolution. At the same time, they understood that the internationalism of Marxism, not as a nice idea but as a necessity to prevent capitalist counter-revolutionary pressures.\n\nIn the end, Trotsky's analysis was proven correct in almost every detail. The USSR never led a revolutionary movement anywhere in the world, with the Comintern being dissolved during the Second World War to appease the imperialists. Where workers states emerged against its advice, nationalism prevented them pooling resources to combat capitalist pressures. In 1991, the bureaucracy restored capitalism as Trotsky, almost uniquely amongst all political commentators, had predicted.\n\nIf you want to learn more, then I'd highly recommend Trotsky's book [The Revolution Betrayed](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/). There's also Lenin's excellent [Better Fewer, But Better](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1923/mar/02.htm) where he begins the struggle against the then emerging bureaucracy which it would be left to Trotsky to continue. Finally, there's Ted Grant's [Russia: From Revolution to Counter-Revolution](https://www.marxist.com/russia-from-revolution-to-counter-revolution.htm) which applies Trotsky's analysis across the whole history of the USSR, from its emergence to its eventual collapse.",

The Chinese Revolution may have succeeded 20 years earlier and with far less bloodshed, which would have been a *massive* boon to the development of workers' governments across the world, and the Spanish Revolution may have ended differently. The 20s and 30s would have still probably looked rather similar to what happened irl, at least before the purges- a growing bureaucratic class would still have pushed for industrialization for their own benefit rather than that of the workers or the world revolution leading to famine across the southern regions of the country. Those famines probably could have been alleviated better without the USSR selling grain to foreign powers, tho whether or not they would have done so still I have no idea.\n\nI think with Trotsky, the big picture change doesn't really come until after WW2, when the Communists in France and Italy had a real chance of seizing power. Stalin encouraged them to go through the bourgeois state rather than stage their own revolutions, a mistake I doubt Trotsky would have made. The French and Italian workers seizing control of their own states and by extension most of western Europe is a huge game-changer for socialism's development globally, and I think the USSR + China + eastern Europe + most of western Europe all being under workers' governments by the end of the 40s is enough to force the capitalist powers to stand on the defensive rather than playing offense through the Cold War. With those conditions the governments of these states would have had far more breathing room and could have relaxed censorship, suppression of opposition, militarization, etc. while the capitalist states would have been scrambling a response",

Would the Spanish workers' organizations have listened to that advice?

It all depends on whether or not enough people took the advice and pushed forward all the way or fell into the traps or social democracy or anarchism",

What happened in 1936 is more the most normal reaction to a coup d'\u00e9tat against a totally legitimate system such as the Second Republic. And although its formation was noteworthy in terms of the process by which it occurred, it cannot be said that it was a fully or predominantly proletarian process since a large part of the bourgeoisie and liberal parties were in favor of the dismissal of Alfonso XIII as king.\n\n\n\nIt is true that the Republic strengthened the PCE, the PSOE and the POUM, and represented significant advances for the workers, but again, it cannot be seen as a solely proletarian period that would lead to a workers' revolution and the establishment of a socialist state, since the bourgeoisie and the right-wing and fascist parties came to have representation and even governed through democratic mechanisms. Having said that, I repeat, there were significant advances and social awareness was raised, producing several uprisings and small revolts, but none of them produced the material conditions to materialize into something.\n\n\n\nI suppose that Trotsky would have been aware of this and perhaps his strategy would have been to strengthen the Marxist parties if he had any kind of influence, so that the first collectivizations would not have taken place so late under anarchism and after the coup d'\u00e9tat, when there was a real revitalization of class feeling, and Marxist measures began to take shape and people decided to try to make the revolution. In this, anarchism and the CNT are hardly vindicated, which were a large part of the achievements of the Republican side in revolutionary matters during the War. It is common, from other positions, to criticize Spanish Trotskyism of that period for at certain times aligning itself with Franco, under the excuse of fear of a post-war Spain as a \"satellite state\" of the USSR and controlled by Stalin. It is difficult to know what really happened or if these are later fabrications by other parties to tarnish the name of Trotskyism. What is certain is that the struggle of the Marxist parties during the dictatorship cannot be defined as a struggle against capital and for the establishment of socialism, but rather as a struggle against fascism and Francoism, which, by the way, makes perfect sense. In this context, the action of Trotskyist parties such as the LCR must be highlighted, which was not only one of the most active in the armed struggle against Francoism, but also carried out the intellectual struggle and is responsible for much of the awareness of young people at the time. Meanwhile, the most recognized struggle of other Marxist parties was from exile and can be summed up in their opposition to the return of the dictatorship and their contribution to the process called the Democratic Transition. Namely, Santiago Carrillo, Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, etc...\n\n\n\nBut none of them was as active before or after in the struggle, beyond what has been mentioned, at least not in the proletarian struggle, as Trotskyist parties were, nor were their contributions to theory as relevant. Felipe Gonzalez broke away from Marxism in 1977 and his party remained, at least nominally, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party. Carrillo was unable to maintain the internal ideological unity of his party, suffering constant splits, sometimes by members perhaps better prepared to understand the material reality of Spain, such as Julio Anguita. Not to mention Pasionaria, who still took \"refuge\" in the USSR, where she had been a faithful defender of Stalin...",

It\u2019s an illusion of \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d - freedom to grind away for mindless consumption, to continue enriching an already super-wealthy elite. You have the freedom to serve the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, or you end up in the street. Some people answer to the dictatorship of the working class. The American answers to the dictatorship of profit, no matter what the human cost. \n\n> What Marxism identifies as a problem that should be eradicated, is in fact irrevocably undivorceable from the human nature. Best we can do is have social safety nets and social programs.\n\nAgain, violence is also part of human nature. We\u2019re pretty successful at discouraging most of that behavior.",

People have natural tendencies towards prioritizing their families (tribalism) and accruing status and wealth and the USSR and China under Mao fought against both. Marx even claimed that it was capitalism that causes greed, even though it existed long before capitalism was ever created. \n\nAlso, the US is not a laissez-faire capitalist country. It is a mixed model of capitalism and socialism, like most modern economies. People are absolutely free to not consume mindlessly and refraining from doing so increases their odds of staying off the streets. \n\nWorking hard has been a feature of humanity throughout its entire history with the exception of a small class of people born into extreme wealth and privilege. Our ancient past was brutal and led to living on a subsistence level that we would badly struggle with today. Hunting and gathering takes quite a bit of time and farming was brutal and none of that came with modern medicine, modern housing, and the endless amount of entertainment that we now have and it wouldn't have allowed for those amenities to happen. We easily work less and get more than our ancient ancestors ever did.",
