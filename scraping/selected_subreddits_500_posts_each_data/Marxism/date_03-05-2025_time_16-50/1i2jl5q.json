I mean, with all the \"cultural Marxism\" fearmongering, it's just not a smart financial move to public something that has a whiff of Marx on it.\n\nBut if you really want stories that teach anti-capitalist values, you can look at Dr. Seuss' works. The Lorax is on the top of the list (the film is very anti-capitalist too).",
