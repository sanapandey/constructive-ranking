    "selftext": "My background is English/literary theory, so my introduction to Marx has gone backwards (beginning with Jameson and the like through the later half of the 20th century). However for an economics course in a history PhD program, my advisor just approved a research project that assesses the journey of Marxist ideals into the field of literary theory in the first part of the 20th century. \nPlease tell me what primary and secondary sources need to be assessed here to get my footing. Who were the trailblazers that led to a pervasive acceptance (or presence) of Marxist thought in academia\u2014especially in lit theory but also economic and political circles? \nI am not claiming that the majority of any American group accepted or subscribed to Marxist thought\u2014but its presence (especially as a tool for interpreting literature and cultural artifacts) persists. \nIn short, it\u2019s easy to locate the presence of Marxist ideas Marxists after WWII in English departments.  But in the early 20th century through the 1920s, was that the case?",

            "body": "The acceptance of Marxist thought into the English-speaking academy, particularly in literary theory and cultural analysis, was shaped by a confluence of historical, intellectual, and political developments. The publication of English translations of Marx\u2019s major works, including Capital and the Communist Manifesto, was instrumental in introducing his ideas to Anglophone audiences. The 1887 translation of Capital by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling, with the involvement of Eleanor Marx, marked a significant moment in this process, as it made Marx\u2019s critique of political economy accessible to English-speaking intellectuals.\n\nThe rise of socialist organizations, such as the Fabian Society in Britain and the Socialist Party of America, provided platforms for the dissemination of Marxist ideas. Publications like The New Masses in the United States and the broader socialist press facilitated the discussion of Marxism as both a theoretical framework and a political practice. The Russian Revolution of 1917 further amplified interest in Marxist theory, as intellectuals and activists sought to understand and respond to the seismic political changes of the era. This period saw an increasing engagement with Marxist ideas, not only as a critique of capitalism but also as a means of analyzing culture and society.\n\nIn literary theory, the influence of figures like Georg Luk\u00e1cs and Christopher Caudwell was critical. Luk\u00e1cs, though not an English-speaking theorist, profoundly impacted Marxist criticism through works such as History and Class Consciousness and The Historical Novel. His concepts of totality, reification, and the historical embeddedness of literature resonated deeply with Anglophone academics. Christopher Caudwell, a British Marxist, directly addressed the relationship between culture, ideology, and material conditions in works like Illusion and Reality (1937), which examined the interplay between poetry, capitalism, and social transformation.\n\nThe Frankfurt School also played a pivotal role in introducing Marxist thought to the Anglophone academy. Figures like Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse expanded Marxist analysis to encompass culture, art, and ideology. While their work initially developed in Germany, the emigration of many Frankfurt School theorists to the United States during the rise of fascism helped embed their ideas in English-speaking academic circles.\n\nThe institutionalization of Marxist literary theory in the English-speaking academy gained momentum after World War II, but its earlier development can be traced through the works and efforts of these thinkers and movements. The interwar period saw Marxist analysis gain traction in cultural criticism, with its focus on the relationship between art, ideology, and material conditions appealing to scholars interested in connecting cultural production to broader social and economic forces. Understanding this trajectory involves engaging with primary sources such as Marx\u2019s own writings and the works of Luk\u00e1cs, Caudwell, and the Frankfurt School, as well as secondary sources that trace the evolution of these ideas, including studies on the influence of socialism and Marxism on interwar cultural movements. This rich intellectual history highlights the ways Marxist thought became a tool not only for critiquing capitalism but also for understanding and interpreting literature and culture.",
