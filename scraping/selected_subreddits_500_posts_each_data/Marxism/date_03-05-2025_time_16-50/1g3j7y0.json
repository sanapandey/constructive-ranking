    "selftext": "Suppose a single working male with no kids. He'd be allocated a single bedroom apartment. What if it faces the ocean but his neighbor faces the city? \n\nWhat if the person who loves looking at city lights is given the sea-facing view? Perhaps they could find each other and swap homes? \n\nWhat if the person on a lower floor wants a brighter view but no one on the top floor wants a darker view. Is there anything that can be done about it? Would a lottery system work? Does each person then only get a fixed time in their apartment? Is the lottery system complex-wide, city-wide, or country-wide? What if the lottery were to allocate you to a sea-view but on the other side of the country? Now you're to say goodbye to your friends.\n\nI can't help but feel like this will end up looking something like today - people scrambling by any means to get the things they want.

We don\u2019t know until we reach communism, it\u2019s a new stage of society where things will look radically different that we can really only make guesses as to how they function. Marxists aren\u2019t here to dictate how this society is organised from a top down approach before it happens with some implemented program. Marxists are just here to agitate for and carry out the revolutionary transition to abolish capitalism. Lots of your suggestions could potentially be how things are decided or they could be completely off the mark. \u201cPrimitive communism\u201d as a Engels referred to it or pre class societies is a good guide but generally property is communally owned and shared. You won\u2019t be tied down to it in the same way. You\u2019ll have a lot more freedom to move I think.",
