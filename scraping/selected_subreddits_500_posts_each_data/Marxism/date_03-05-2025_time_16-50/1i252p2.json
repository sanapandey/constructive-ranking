    "selftext": "I've been thinking about assembling a reading guide for someone who wants to study Marx and Marxism in depth, so here it is! The objective is to provide theoretical guidance to\u00a0**beginners**\u00a0who want to advance\u00a0**past the basics**, when it comes to familiarizing and, why not, expertizing oneself in Marx's thought. It's important to note that, even though this guide will mainly be focusing on Marx, other thinkers are vital to one's understanding of Marxism and its usage as a political and methodological tool; Marxism is a constantly evolving scientific toolbox and one's bookshelf must not limit itself to works written two centuries ago. That being said, Marx holds a unique position within the genealogical tree of Marxist thinkers, as a foundational method of analysis lies in his works. I'm posting here, in order to receive your comradely feedback, which is always greatly welcome and appreciated!\n\n***Prerequisite knowledge:***  \nAs Lenin writes:\u00a0*\"\\[Marx's\\] doctrine emerged as the direct and immediate\u00a0continuation\u00a0of the*  \n*teachings of the greatest representatives of philosophy, political economy and socialism.\"*\u00a0Therefore, it is useful, though not necessary for most texts I'll be recommending, to equip oneself with pieces that clear the fog out of Marx's theoretical roots, in order to be familiar with the development of Marx's interests, as well as all the references that are scattered across the texts. For that reason, I'd like to recommend two books for those who would like not to get straight into Marx: a).\u00a0**Reason and Revolution (part 1)**\u00a0by Herbert Marcuse and b).\u00a0**Wealth of Nations**\u00a0by Adam Smith, to learn more about Hegelian philosophy and classical political economy respectively. Without further ado, here comes the reading list (ordered):\n\n1).\u00a0**\"Estranged Labour\"**\u00a0(part of Marx's\u00a0**\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\"**)  \nWeirdly, this text is not recommended enough to the slightest, even though it provides a solid introduction to Marx's conception of alienation and its relation to private property.\n\n2).\u00a0**\"Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\"**\u00a0Provides, in an easy and sort of journalistic way, a guiding line regarding Marx's methodology in analyzing and critiquing political economy.\n\n3).\u00a0**\"Value, Price and Profit\"**\u00a0and\u00a0**\"Wage Labour and Capital\"**\u00a0A mini \\*Das Kapital-\\*pair that does an excellent job introducing the reader to key concepts, such as \"commodity\", \"value\", \"surplus value\",  \n\"rate of exploitation\", \"capital\" etc. These two small texts are bound to leave question marks, but will also trigger your curiosity and familiarize you with Marx's writing style.\n\n4).\u00a0**\"The Communist Manifesto\"**\u00a0Though not the epitome of Marx's thought as usually described, it is a turning point in Marxist literature and outlines basic communist positions in a comprehensive and inspiring way.\n\n5).\u00a0**\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\"**\u00a0An important station in Marx's  \njourney: the moment Marx became a communist. Contains main ideas in both the  \narea of political economy, as well as Hegelian philosophy.\n\n7).\u00a0**\"Theses on Feuerbach\"**\u00a0Written one year after the\u00a0*1844 Manuscripts.*\u00a0Many thinkers, such as Althusser, have described this text as a pivotal point in Marx's epistemology, in which he launches a theoretical attack on Feuerbach, which is further elaborated in the following text.\n\n8).\u00a0**\"The German Ideology (vol. 1)\"**\u00a0Perhaps one of the most important texts of Marx and Engels, where they lay the foundations for scientific socialism and the materialist conception of history.\n\n9).\u00a0**\"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\"**\u00a0A thorough investigation of historical events from a Marxist perspective.\n\n10).\u00a0**\"The Capital (vol. 1)\"**\u00a0Arguably Marx's magnum opus, a work that will equip one with the necessary knowledge and methodological tools to understand the motion of the capitalist mode of production, as well as later mutations of capitalism (i.e. imperialist capitalism). It is a pity, though partially understandable, that such a work is demonized within leftist circles; in fact, it contains fundamental elements of Marxist thought.\n\n11).\u00a0**\"The Poverty Of Philosophy\"**\u00a0Apart from being a critique of anarchist thinker Proudhon, it is a stage of clarification within Marx's thought, where he elaborates on his views around economics and scientific socialism, attacking various trends of utopian and reformist socialism.\n\n12).\u00a0**\"The Grundrisse\"**\u00a0Capital's theoretical workshop, a book full of insights, yet dense and notoriously difficult to read. Here, Marx puts his method - dialectic of concrete and abstract - in action, analyzing a broad range of materials, from the commodity fetish to human nature.\n\n13).\u00a0**\"Critique of the Gotha Program\"**\u00a0and\u00a0**\"The Civil War in France\"**\u00a0A short polemic of Marx that contains great value the modern socialist movement can learn from and an application of Marxist thought to an important historical event that will help one understand works of later Marxist thinkers, such as Lenin's\u00a0*State and Revolution*.\n\n14).\u00a0**\"The Capital (vol. 2 and 3)\"**\n\n***Tips:***\u00a0Feel free to experiment with different thinkers while engaging with theory. While it is better to be familiar with Marx's own text in order to proceed to thinkers that expand upon Marx, it's a crucial mistake to limit oneself to Marx alone. Between each text, you are greatly encouraged to explore the works of Engels, Lenin, Gramsci, Althusser and other important theorists to enrich your understanding of different aspects of revolutionary theory. Moreover, feel free to return back to texts you've already read to solidify your understanding throughout your studies.\n\nEdit: After a suggestion, I rearranged the order of \"*The Capital (vol. 1)\"*",

            "body": "It's worth assessing who this is for. We need several lists, not a single one, to help someone out. Is someone actually reading thousands of pages of Marx, or do they need to get some basic stuff down right away? Learning is a spiral, not a straightforward march. Lots of people might read a bunch of short stuff and then go and read Capital if they want to. If they are willing to read a lot, just tell them to start with Capital.\n\nThe list should also not impose certain interpretations on someone. Front-loading things like Marcuse, Estranged Labor, The Theses, or The German Ideology does that. I don't get including Marcuse at all, but The German Ideology is also a bad text to use as an overview of Marx and Engels.  See [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2622409](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2622409)\n\nA more moderate project might use \"Wage Labor and Capital\" as a starting place, since it gives a decent distillation of some of their ideas, then weave in \"The Communist Manifesto\" before tackling other particular texts. The CM is a great all around text that does not clash with their earlier or later priorities.\n\nMost realistically for new readers, I have used the Tucker anthology (The Marx-Engels Reader) to great effect. Reading through it carefully (rather than blasting through it) will do a lot of work. You can teach someone a great deal about Marx through that text. There is a good chunk of Capital, plus excerpts or complete versions of many texts listed above.\n\nPS just call it Capital, not The Capital. This is due to a difference in how English and German work as languages.",

I would recommend reading a collection of texts from *\"The Grundrisse\"*, though I don't have any translated in English.",

After all, the reason I suggested the *\"Theses on Feuerbach\"* right afterwards is partially to showcase the development of Marx's thought.",

                            "body": "I don\u2019t know if it is good to be familiar with it, not in the way it\u2019s presented in the *Manuscripts*. Marx returns to the concept of alienation a few times in *Capital*, *Grundrisse*, and elsewhere, but he does so with entirely different language and an entirely different analysis. In the *Manuscripts*, alienation is like Spirit for Hegel: he finds bits of it in every person, and in every historical moment and institution. Later in his life, he relegates alienation to an afterthought, a simple corollary to the historical and political-economic analysis he\u2019s already elaborated. \n\nAnd you don\u2019t have to put that change in Althusser\u2019s words. He was not the first person to say that Marx changed over time, nor the last\u2014he was only the most popular. Ronald Meek ten years earlier wrote a book (*Studies in the Labor Theory of Value*) saying of the *Manuscripts* that \u201cMarx cannot yet be said to have become a Marxist.\u201d Sartre, too, was a rival of Althusssr\u2019s, but he very much agreed that early Marx was not the same as old.\n\nBut again, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s necessary to go that far with the argument. At *best*, the *Manuscripts* are filled with a bunch of half-baked ideas that Marx tidies up in later works, and which, in their manner of presentation in 1844, are leaden with controversy. At *worst*, the *Manuscripts* absolutely do not reflect the views or methods of what we would today call \u201cMarxism.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t mind if somebody goes back to the *Manuscripts* later on and comes out of it a Marxist-humanist. That\u2019s their privilege. I just think as a beginner\u2019s list, it\u2019s a really esoteric, controversial work.",
