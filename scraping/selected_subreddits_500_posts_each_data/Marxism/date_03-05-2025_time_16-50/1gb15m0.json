There\u2019s an objective material cost, manufacturing, transport cost, etc etc. But how can you apply LTV for services? For example, a therapist that is employed by a clinic. It is inherent that he is having the surplus value extracted from him, otherwise the clinic wouldn\u2019t have profits and would go bankrupt, but how do you calculate the value of a therapy session? If the therapist generates 50 dollars of \u201cvalue\u201d per 8 hour day, but gets paid only for the first 4 hours, how did the clinic calculate the total value of his work day for a completely abstract service? What parameters were involved? Other examples could be teachers, doctors, surgeons, garbage men, etc. All these services don\u2019t actually produce physical objects, so how do you figure out their labor value? Thanks for reading.

            "body": "Services are a commodity just like any other, the difference is just that the production of the commodity happens at the same time as its consumption, so like all other goods the value is determined by the Labour time necessary for its reproduction. So for example a therapist giving '10 hours' of services, plus the necessary time training and education that went in to providing that services. (divided by the total rendering of services, for example if they were trained for 1000 hours and provided 1000 hours of therapy, that would add one hour total in value per hour rendered) Education/training can be thought of like machinery or tools for any other commodity which add value to the commodity due to the congealed labour within them.",

            "body": "An important note: the only manifestation of an object's value is its exchange-value. exchange-value is synonymous with the category of equilibrium price. So, if you calculated the equilibrium wage of a therapist across the industry, you would get the exchange-value. Marx played around with being able to calculate this from the end of labor but IMO, this is unnecessary, and unweildy. \n\nI'm worried you might be making a classic mistake on the labor theory of value that I'd like to correct. Marx's value theory actually has two sides to it. One side is that labor creates value and that a capitalist hiring a laborer must extract surplus-value to make a profit. From this, many people take the conclusion that surplus-value extraction is wrong or counts as \"theft\" and Marx believes the worker deserves all or most of the value of their labor and communism is partially about achieving this goal. \n\nBut Marx was not such a simple thinker. The other side of the theory: \n\n>\"The capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible, and to make, whenever possible, two working days out of one. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working day to one of definite normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides.\"\n\n-Marx, Capital Vol 1, ch 10, section 1\n\n>\"If, therefore, the magnitude of value advanced in wages is not merely found again in the product, but is found there augmented by a surplus-value, this is not because the seller has been defrauded, for he has really received the value of his commodity; it is due solely to the fact that this commodity has been used up by the buyer.\" \n\n-Marx, Capital Vol 1, ch 24, section 1\n\nThe other side of the theory is that the Capitalist has purchased a commodity (labor-power) and therefore has the right to get as much use of it as he wants, like squeezing the last tube out of a toothpaste. The laborer's right to the product of their labor and the capitalist's right to use their purchased object as they see fit meet each other as valid bourgeois rights to property. This is the battleground on which class struggle plays out. \n\nBut Marx doesn't think that this battle ends by the workers winning the right to control their surplus-value. Instead, workers fight for surplus-value but begin to realize their problems are inseparable from political problems and then realize that only a communist society would truly solve all these problems and that they already possess the means to do it. \n\nWe can see this play out among German workers in the leadup to the German Revolution in 1918. Many workers were patriotic or apolitical at the beginning of WWI. The most radical shop stewards of the unions refused to sign a no-strike deal with the government because they believed it would make it harder to fight without the right to strike. As the war pushed them harder, they soon found that the better wages and conditions they were fighting for were inescapably bound up in the war and they would have to fight against that too. Their strikes and labor actions took on a political character. Soon, they realized that this fight too was a losing one because all the causes of the war were bound up to the capitalist mode of production. And so many who had been moderate social democrats or apolitical unionists became communist revolutionaries. \n\nNotice that it's actually the *failure* to win the fight for surplus-value sufficiently that causes an increase in class consciousness here. That isn't always the case but it does illustrate my point well. \n\nMany people make the mistake of viewing Marx's value theory as just being about a noble struggle of the worker for what they rightfully deserve. This is understandable because Marx assumes that workers are already doing this, and they were in his day. He didn't think he needed to tell them how to fight for their interests, just on where their struggle truly concluded. Nowadays, socialists have the added work of convincing workers that they have a shared interest and should be organizing and fighting for a bigger piece of the pie at all. A lot of this does have to do with the difference between industrial production and the service/care sector IMO, along with Marx's theory using the language of classical economics instead of the neoclassical language we are familiar with.",

He follows my quote by saying, \"Hence is it that in the history of capitalist production, the determination of what is a working day, presents itself as the result of a struggle, a struggle between collective capital, i.e., the class of capitalists, and collective labour, i.e., the working-class.\" \n\nThe chapter does end with Marx saying basically what youre saying but I fail to see how that somehow changes the meaning of this paragraph at all.",

                    "body": "I may have misunderstood your point citing that first paragraph, but what I meant is that Marx is basically being ironic there, and I wasn't sure if you were implying that. You do go on to say that surplus value isn't theft for Marx, but I think it absolutely is. True, we could split hairs and deny it on terminological grounds, since indeed I guess there can't be theft if you don't acknowledge the right to private property at all in the first place. But surplus value is absolutely the manifestation of capitalists exploiting the working class, and the main goal of communist society is precisely to abolish that struggle and hence any surplus value.\n\nI still don't really see how taking the average salary of all therapists helps answer the question, though! On Marx's account, workers are basically paid the exchange value of their means of subsistence, not the value of what they produce (that's the whole point!). the question asked how the Capitalists (the owners of the clinic, presumably) calculate the value of a given worker's services. I'm not even sure I understand the question; what is meant by value here? If what they mean is how much they should pay the workers, clearly Marx would say that that's just a matter of paying them enough for them to be able to come back the next day and do their work again (again, their means of subsistence). I initially thought the question was about how you would calculate that value in a communist society, i.e., how many hours of labor you should actually dedicate to therapy services. If so, even if you could \"copy\" the mean wages for therapists in other capitalist economies that would not tell you what the actual socially necessary labor hours are, since as you correctly point out you only observe the exchange value of therapy services, but those include socially necessary labor hours AND surplus value, and that's the thing: you don't know how much each of those are!\n\nFrankly, I think that this is pointing to one of the main objections to Marx's theory of value, which is that it is simply false that all value comes from labor, at least in the sense of all value being reducible to some abstract \"unit of labor\". Some therapists are paid more than others, and even more than, say, waiters, and there doesn't seem to be anything in Marx's theory to tell us how much more valuable the labor hours of the best paid therapists are compared to those of waiters. In the case of easily reproducible commodities, you can sort of see how one would go about calculating it, but something like therapy services, imo, just manifests that value is ultimately dependent on utility (i.e., how much patients value the services provided by specific therapists). Coming back to the proposal of using average salaries as a proxy for their real value, this, in my view, highlights the problem that how many hours of labor are necessary to provide a given good or service depends on the productive structure of the economy as a whole (i.e., how much capital you dedicate to improving productivity in restaurants vs. therapy clinics), which itself depends on the utility buyers get from those services, NOT how many labor hours are needed to provide them in the present circumstances!\n\nHope I don't come across as rude or anything, you're clearly knowledgeable and I appreciate the chance to dust off my understanding of Marxist LTV!",

This paragraph is Marx saying exactly that. Later in the chapter he talks about workers being forced to look for work on the market and therefore the exchange made between workers and capitalists isn't simply a contract between equals, like many capitalists claim. That would actually make less sense if this paragraph were meant to be read as ironic. \n\n>Some therapists are paid more than others, and even more than, say, waiters, and there doesn't seem to be anything in Marx's theory to tell us how much more valuable the labor hours of the best paid therapists are compared to those of waiters.\n\nValue theory isn't price theory.

In our current society, the forces of supply and demand are occurring in a capitalist economic format, where we exchange currency for goods that generate profits for w/e business we are buying it from. Supply and demand exists in all economic systems, including a potential communist society, it's just that supply and demand takes a specific form in capitalist society (profit driven, with currency)\n\nSo this very simple model explains it:\n\nObject with functional value (utility) -------Supply and Demand-----------> Price of Object in $$\n\nAs you can see, something has value and then the forces of supply and demand in capitalist society \"convert\" (for lack of a better term) the value of that thing into a dollar amount.\n\nWhen it comes to the beginning of the equation, the utility; this CANNOT be measured in any objective way. There is no measurement tool that can be used to measure functional value the way that we can use a ruler to measure inches. We KNOW from out human experience that the value of something is comprised of what you have listed: the material itself, the time it took to create it, the labor of the workers (both manual and intellectual). However that value is not OBJECTIVE.\n\nFor example, let's say I make you a chair and it takes me 5 hours. If I were to ask you to give me the units of value of the chair, how would you calculate it and give me an number that is NOT the price (remember, value and price are NOT the same).\n\n5 hours + wood + glue + screws + my intellectual and manual labor = ??? units of value\n\nDo you see what I mean? It's true that those things all contribute to the value of something but there is no way to objectively measure it the way we would with many other things. Price exists to try to take that ??? and convert it into SOME kind of a number.",

Again, this is about a CONCEPT; we can conceptually understand LTV by assigning any numbers we want, while simultaneously knowing that the numbers cannot be objectively measures.\n\nCapital of capitalist = 50 units of value  \nLabor of workers = 50 units of value\n\n50 units of capital value + 50 units of labor value = 100 units of production value (let's say its a chair that we made)\n\nNow, we take the thing that is worth 100 units of value (combining the 50 units of capitals with 50 units of labor value) and we have to sell it on the market. We go back to the original model I wrote, the one where something with value becomes a $$ through supply and demand.\n\n100 units of value -------Supply and Demand-----------> $100 (this is a random number, I am just choosing $100 to illustrate a concept, I could choose any number and this would still work\n\nSo we see that in my theoretical example, 1 unit of value = $1. \n\nSo how does the exploitation occur? Now we have to take the $100 and distribute it to the two people who contributed to the making of the chair; the capitalist who owned the capital and the worker who did the labor.\n\n50 units of capital = $50: this is what the capitalist would receive IF CAPITALISM GAVE HIM WHAT HE CONTRIBUTED\n\n50 units of labor = $50: this is what the worker would receive IF CAPITALISM GAVE HIM WHAT HE CONTRIBUTED\n\nThis is the rub; the capitalist already had to spend $50 to have the capital. The worker, who contributed his labor, didn't have to spend $$ to work (workers take other risks, but that is outside the scope of what I am explaining to you).\n\nSo the capitalist making $50 off the chair is a problem for him because it puts him at $0; if he DOES NOT exploit his worker, he makes $0. How can he make $51 or more? Simple: the worker, whose value should equate to $50, will be paid $49, and the $1 that was taken from him goes to the capitalist. This is why capitalism has exploitation; the only way a capitalist can make money off of your labor is to steal your labor value, but he does it through the $$ that your value was converted to.\n\nA lot of this stuff is hard to quantify, but it's about the CONCEPT. You could take my equation and change it, and get the same result. Let's say I do that:\n\n75 units of capital + 25 units of labor = 100 units of value ------Supply and Demand -----> $200 (1 unit of value = $2)\n\n75 units of capital = $150: this is what the capitalist would receive IF CAPITALISM GAVE HIM WHAT HE CONTRIBUTED\n\n25 units of labor = $50: this is what the worker would receive IF CAPITALISM GAVE HIM WHAT HE CONTRIBUTED\n\nSo now, the capitalist AGAIN is only breaking even. When he exploits his worker, he NOW can make a profit. He takes $1 away from the worker who should be getting $50 (and is now getting $49) so that he can make $151, when his contribution is only $150.",

All that matters is that we KNOW that a capitalist MUST steal your labor value to make money off of you. There are equations that business analysts use to determine how many $$ someone's labor is worth, and they make sure to pay their worker less than that! The way they come up with that calculation is customized to the business/industry they are in.\n\nThis is the best answer I can give to your question: labor value cannot be measured. Capitalist society converts the functional value of all things (utility) into a price ($$) and we know that CONCEPTUALLY you as the worker must be exploited for the capitalist to do more than break even. This is why Marx tells us that calling capitalism \"evil\" isn't really useful, because capitalism is about a mathematical relationship that is unbalanced, regardless of the personalities involved.\n\nCommunism seeks to solve this problem by unifying the people who own the capital and the people who do the labor; hence the term \"workers owning the means of production\".\n\nI could keep going, but this is the best answer I have for you, which is that measuring value objectively is very hard, but not actually necessary. Therefore, we measure exploitation in $$. The way we calculate how many $$ a worker's labor brings in depends on the business and a lot of factors that are unique to each individual situation, but we also know that if a capitalist is making $$ off of your labor, it's because they are exploiting you, giving you less $$ than what your labor value was worth.\n\nPrice and Value are NOT the same!\n\nEnd of explanation; thanks for reading!",

I\u2019ve been working my way through LTV and had gotten ahold of the concept of surplus value, but I think your explanation really solidified it for me, and also cleared my head regarding my question on this post. I\u2019m quite a contextual learner so I also really appreciate you giving situations with actual numbers instead of just abstract examples too, so again thanks a lot for this write up :)",
