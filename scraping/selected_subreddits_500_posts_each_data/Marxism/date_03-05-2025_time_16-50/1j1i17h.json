It is pure propaganda when people insist Russia was communist, when it's never been more than state-owned capitalism.\n\nBut why has no state ever succeeded in reaching communism? I think at least in part, bc there's never been a coordinated effort to educate the masses in Marxism, which is obviously a threat to the bugousie. Until the masses understand Marxism they are are easily swayed by capitalist/bugousie propaganda against Marxism. And bc it seems that a project large enough to educate the 99% on Marxism would necessarily require the power of the state, I wonder how it could ever happen?\n\nI know Marx thought there was going to be a proletarian uprising. But, that was when capitalism was a manufacturing and industrial system. Under the current techno-feudal system, I struggle to see it happening as Marx projected. \n\nHowever, in his book, \"Another Now,\" Yanis Varoufakis, provides a persuasive idea for how Marx's ideas could begin to rise under the new techno-feudalism, and challenge capital to create something at least approaching communism.",

The embargos in Cuba, Korea, and the global south are meant to accomplish this very thing. \n\nIf a more developed nation had a revolution, right off the bat they would be in a better place to achieve real Marxism than Russia and China were.\n\nWolff's ideas should be thought of as Communism with American characteristics. He is often able to make Trotskyists, Maoists, and to a lesser degree Marxist-Leninists angry over his \"watered-down\" opinions.

I read him more than anything like a typical Althusserian opportunist, willing to bend Marx's theory and terminology for the purpose of achieving popularity, even if it costs him the long term success of his political project.\n\nHis framing of co-ops and a market under socialism is particularly egregious, as in practice it makes him align more with a syndicalist mindset and implies at least a partial rejection of Marx's theory on the nature of value and capital.",

A professor willing to do this openly on YouTube was something I had never seen before and it was very valuable to me. He also distilled communism into something that I could finally understand, albeit vaguely, and is very accessible on YouTube. So as someone to whet your appetite and destigmatize the idea of communism, I think he's effective. \n\nHowever, he's not the end-all and unless you're willing to ultimately move past his flavor of analysis, I think Wolff can be harmful. For instance, he famously sympathized with the Canadian trucker convoy \"Freedom Convoy\" when it was plain to even liberals that it was a convoy of wildly racist right wing small business owners, not truckers, crying about vaccines and covid restrictions. I lost a lot of respect for him for this, and to my knowledge, he has never wavered in his position. There are other criticisms I can make of his chosen associations (i.e. FREQUENT appearances on the Jimmy Dore show) that, for someone trying to learn about communism and putting their trust in Wolff, is a dangerous pipeline and simply embarrassing for Wolff. I also echo what other comments say about his analysis failures, but wanted to focus on other elements not mentioned.\n\nIn short, I think he's effective as a primer, but unless one is willing to see him as a primer and evolve past him, Wolff is stunting and even actively harmful. \n\n[Richard Wolff on the Freedom Convoy](https://youtu.be/zo13VR9C2uI?si=jkXc2tZk_gG6Qp3Q)\n\n[Wiki on the Freedom Convoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest)",

It's also needed for the United States and Europe itself.  Without a debt right down and debt cancellation economics in the in the West have come to a dead end.\n\nMichael Hudson thinks capitalism can be saved by having regular debt cancellation and other government reforms, as is typical of \"academic Marxists\" who have rejected Marx's explanation of the inevitability of the breakdown of the profit system and the objectively revolutionary character of the working class, regardless of what this or that worker may think.\n\nI have seen and read a bit of Hudson but I have never heard him address the following from Marx:\n\n>\"...

These contradictions, of course, lead to explosions, crises, in which momentary suspension of all labour and annihilation of a great part of the capital violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled \\[to go on\\] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.  Yet, these regularly recurring catastrophes lead to their repetition on a higher scale, and finally to its violent overthrow. \"  \n[Grundrisse: Notebook VII \u2013 The Chapter on Capital (Marx 1857) ](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch15.htm)  \n\nThe epoch of capitalist wars and workers' revolutions that began in August 1914 has not gone away. The present, latest, greatest episode of capitalist breakdown has opened the first battles of World War Three (as the U.S. seeks to maintain its hegemony over the world economy), austerity (as the capitalist class everywhere seeks to overcome the tendency of the rate of profit to decline) and dictatorship (as the capitalist class, conscious of its weakness, seeks to repress and crush the growing opposition.)  \n  \nThose who think reforms are possible tacitly have illusions in the viability of capitalism.     \n  \nThe Marxist opposition to such apologetics is to warn workers, students and youth that the options we face are socialist revolution or capitalist barbarism.  Struggle will decide.    \n  \nI recommend the following:   \n[Why Study the Russian Revolution? - online lecture (WSWS-David North, 2017) \\[110 minutes\\]](https://www.youtube.com/live/kK-AMCP9YNY?si=PgSUtjukVRgjeuSy&t=169)\n\n\\^ - It is worth noting that Hudson is Leon Trotsky's godson.

Marx and Engels argued that the state would not simply dissolve but wither away as communism developed. Lenin expanded on this in State and Revolution, emphasizing that the proletariat must seize state power to suppress the bourgeoisie and transition toward a classless society. The socialist state will have to remain to defend the revolution from fascists and imperialists for as long as it takes.\n\nSocialist states did not get \"hung up\" on state-controlled capitalism. They faced imperialist encirclement, economic backwardness, and internal counterrevolution. Policies like the NEP in the USSR or market reforms in China were temporary measures to strengthen socialism, not abandon it.\n\nWolff\u2019s argument aligns with idealist and utopian views that expect an immediate leap to communism. In reality, socialism is a long and contested process. Most Marxist-Leninists reject his conclusion because it ignores the material conditions revolutionary states must navigate. \n\nWolff either knows this and waters down his arguments to make Marxism more palatable for Americans who recoil at any defense of real socialist states, or he genuinely misunderstands the necessity of a workers state in the transition to communism.",
