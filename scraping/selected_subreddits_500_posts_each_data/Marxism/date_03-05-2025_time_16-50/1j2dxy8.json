    "selftext": "There are two major tropes I often see in arguments around economic theory that I think every Marxist should remember, especially if they discuss their beliefs with staunch capitalists.\n\n1. Class Conflict: Conservatives and capitalists have a tendency to credit (blame) all mention of class conflict on Marx. However, Adam Smith, who laid the bedrock for almost all classic capitalist thinking, argued that class conflict emerged naturally from the competition between different economic sectors, like landlords and tenants, in the Wealth of Nations (1776)--almost a hundred years before Marx wrote Capitol Vol. 1 (1867). Marx only elevated this theory, giving it further definition, dialectic substance, and trajectory.\n2. \"Time is money.\" This is a popular phrase everywhere in economics, and can probably be first attributed to Ben Franklin, who said it in his essay \"Advice to a Young Tradesman\" (1748), but I wonder if they recognize it is also the fundamental principle underlying the labor theory of value. I have met so-called Marxists who have never heard of the theory, and it goes without saying that the average American capitalist does not even know that Marx was a theorist, but the entire plot of Capital can be boiled down to a treatise on the relation of money to time. Even though he was not the first to say it, this is the most Marxist of Marxist phrases possible to utter.",

So, the relevant text is here: [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm)\n\nI'm particularly talking about paragraphs from:  \n  \n\"Since 1848 capitalist production has developed rapidly in Germany, and at the present time it is in the full bloom of speculation and swindling. But fate is still unpropitious to our professional economists. At the time when they were able to deal with Political Economy in a straightforward fashion, modern economic conditions did not actually exist in Germany. And as soon as these conditions did come into existence, they did so under circumstances that no longer allowed of their being really and impartially investigated within the bounds of the bourgeois horizon. In so far as Political Economy remains within that horizon, in so far, i.e., as the capitalist r\u00e9gime is looked upon as the absolutely final form of social production, instead of as a passing historical phase of its evolution, Political Economy can remain a science only so long as the class struggle is latent or manifests itself only in isolated and sporadic phenomena.\"\n\nto:\n\n\"The peculiar historical development of German society therefore forbids, in that country, all original work in bourgeois economy; but not the criticism of that economy. So far as such criticism represents a class, it can only represent the class whose vocation in history is the overthrow of the capitalist mode of production and the final abolition of all classes \u2014 the proletariat.[]()\"",

Long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists, the economic anatomy of classes. What I did that was new was to prove:  \n(1) that the existence of classes is only bound up with the particular, historical phases in the development of production,  \n(2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat,  \n(3) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society.\"\n\n(Marx to Weydemeyer)\n\nSocial-democrats, liberals, conservatives, fascists, all of them can (and historically, usually did) recognise the existence of classes and class conflict. What sets communists apart from them is that communists stand for the end of class society through a socialist revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat, the last universal class in the history of class society.\n\nLikewise, the point Marx is making is not the same point as Franklin, Locke, Smith or Ricardo. He takes the categories of classical bourgeois political economy in order to show they are historically bound and can be abolished. Marxism is not about the labour theory of value. It's about the abolition of value and related categories.",
