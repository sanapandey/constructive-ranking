    "selftext": "Hello my friends, I want to keep the question simple but feel free to share your perspective as you please:\n I belive AI generated images are (morally) wrong. And I believe so because I see it as unrewarded labour from the artists whose art is taken unwillingly by the companies who then use that work to replace the artist. Basically I think it's unrewarding labor and taking jobs from artist. \nWith this I was wondering what were your options on this matter, for I heard that apparently if one's an artist and a so called communist they must be always willing to give their work because they \" are again private property and a work of art is private property\" (context to this \"I heard\" bellow) \n\nI'd just like to see how some of you view this subject and what you have to say, \nthank you. \n\nStory time:\nVery quickly, I was with my partner and a friend of hers sent her an AI generated picture, she pointed out to him that it was wrong because they were stealing artist work and replacing them and therefore even if he's not the one using the AI generator he's still helping it be spread and normalized. He then brought up communism ( probably since my partner even tho maybe not a Marxist she aligns with left wing views) and how communist shouldn't have an issue with \"stolen art\" because they are against private property... She showed me the conversation and I, who I believe I align with Marxism said I think AI generated images are wrong because it's unpaid labor and taking jobs from artist. She told the dude that but he still argued that most communist wouldn't agree with me, so here I am. \n\nP.S.: I hope bad writing isn't a problem, English is not my first language and either way I'm not very good at pontuation, so apologies. \nAlso this post was meant to be posted on r/communism, but I think I was banned 4 years ago for having memes posted on my account so um yeah ",

I'm pretty sure someone's artistic creation doesn't count as a means of production.\n\nA professional artist must make a living in order to continue being a professional artist. This is the reality of our economic system. If he doesn't make a living from it, he simply won't be able to continue  producing art professionally but as a hobby in his free time since he will have to work somewhere else.\n\nTechnology should be used to empower the workers either they practice physical or mental activities. The fact that technology harms the workers is a perfect reflection of how technology ought to be under a system where first and foremost, it has to serve the interests of  that  system.\n\nTherefore in a capitalist system it will mainly benefit the rulers of the system and not the mass population.\n\nTherefore I'm morally against it. I'm also against it  on a personal level, because I don't find anything appealing about AI \" ART\" \nWhat I think that it is very important in art is the conscious practice of it with a clean purpose and the creative and experimental touches of each piece that comes from our humanity. I never understood it's appeal on that level.",

Add to this the insane cost of compute power used for AI. OpenAI is burning 5 billion dollars in investor money every year without turning a profit. If they can\u2019t figure out how to make money, the faucet turns off and the whole industry collapses.\n\nAI art already looks dated imo. It\u2019s pretty easy to pick out most of the time and has problems that can\u2019t be fixed, like sucking at text and adding extra fingers to people\u2019s hands.

As for the question of the importance of a given tool of productive capital potentially proletarianizing some section of the petite bourgeois, that isn't uniquely different from any other tool doing the same. Smashing cotton looms didn't meaningfully forestall the proletarianization of the Luddites, and their attempting to do so was short sighted and limited in the goals it considered. What the political project of Marxism seeks to do is not to prevent people from becoming workers by maintaining private ownership of productive means, it is to politically unite workers towards their self interest as a class! \n\nThat all said, the comparison of the cotton loom to generative image software isn't strictly a fitting one. Digital artists owning given digital art tools are not themselves a substantially large portion of artists or the petite bourgeois broadly unlike the artisans of the 19th century, and the invention of a given image generator is not nearly as economically impactful as the loom. The real throughline is that any politics that seek only to maintain the position of certain petite bourgeois are not politics that are considerate of the proletariat or otherwise in its interest.",

All art is culture, it doesn't matter the art or the context. New cultures form and grow constantly, the idea of culture being chained to historical regional groups is ridiculous and rooted in the belief that the modern capitalistic system represents the end of history and that from now on there will be no meaningful large-scale changes in society or the way things function, which is especially antithetical to communism.\n\nArt is an expression of the culture it comes from, whether that's a mainstream recognized culture or what is referred to (derisively, originally) as a subculture. It cannot be divorced from the culture in either its creation or its impact. The culture grows around and incorporates popular art, it becomes part of the DNA of the culture with success. Even a piece of art that only one person cared about can end up becoming part of the DNA of the culture. Let's say one person is influenced by a work, one person is influenced by their work, one person is influenced by their work, and millions of people are influenced by that work. That original one is now a vital part of the DNA of the soul of that culture. Culture should *never* belong to anyone. Culture should never be property.",

And this is the experience of all artistic disciplines.\u00a0 It is an exercise in steady mastery over one's own self and one's own intuitive understanding of the divine symmetries and ratios that govern consciousness and life and order in general.\u00a0 And I don't think of it as *labor* so much as a *spiritual experience of connecting your unconscious mind with the world*.\u00a0 And maybe that all sounds a bit too precious, but I think people who feel that way should try it before they diminish it, because there are few experiences in this world that have made me feel as *human* as learning to play guitar.\u00a0\n\n\nI think that generative AI is just the culmination of decades through which the experience and practice of art and making art was commodified and then steadily devalued.\u00a0 I also think that in the grand scheme of history, people who have been able to make their living exclusively in art have been both exceptional and exceptionally lucky.\u00a0 But the idea that these algorithms can somehow *replace* that experience, and the people who single mindedly steal the necessary time from the drudgery of life to pursue it, is revolting to me on a deep level.\u00a0 I stand against anyone who believes in or supports that, whatever their politics otherwise.\u00a0 It speaks to a broad misunderstanding of why people do these things or what they're for.\u00a0 I can see some people earnestly using AI as just another tool for expression, but to the degree it is designed to *supplant* human expression, or make it more *efficient* or *profitable*, it is my mortal enemy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that's without even getting into the nightmare of unlimited propaganda, misinformation, and scams it's already unleashing.\u00a0 Who *wanted* this?\u00a0 Who *needed* this?\u00a0",

The first thing is that copyright law and an artist's \"ownership\" of their work is a fraught and complicated legal quagmire that occasionally even goes to the Supreme Court. If I'm remembering the case right, Rauschenberg made an artwork incorporating an image of a Rastafarian man that was taken by another artist. A lawsuit over IP theft ensued and some interesting questions came up. The thing about copyright laws is that there is an important stipulation for art: if you alter the work or add to it then it isn't considered theft. This allows for a collage artist to use a magazine cover and allowed for people like Andy Warhol to use images from advertisements and popular culture in his art. \n\nI think it's a slippery slope to say that art can be owned in the way you're talking about. In the case of AI image generation using the work of other artists, the notion that their work is being fundamentally altered is important. The AI doesn't just paste the work of someone else, it changes the essence of the artist's work into an entirely new thing.\n\nIf anything I think the AI application is the least egregious form of copyright infringement there could be. Is an AI using its knowledge of an artist's work to create an image any different than a human artist being inspired by a Picasso and altering their style in their next work to emulate him? \n\nWe can't dig our heels in when it comes to new tech, we need to embrace it. I agree that the entirety of the tech and specifically AI sector are already out of the hands of the proletariat and that is concerning, but the generative AI art issue is different than the weaponization of AI against the working class.",

In theory the same as the generative AI but the main difference is that often the musician who wants to use the sample asks for permission or credits or give royalties to the original. Something that I believe should have happened in the cases you mentioned, being the mention of the first artist the bare minimum.\n\nThat is my biggest issue the labor of an artist being ignored and not valued, either by an AI or someone sampling their work. AI is brought up in particular because of how frequent these companies take the work from artists without them knowing and completely ignoring someone spent hours on every single of those pieces and that most make a living out of it.",

It's a means to **increase productivity**, regarding output and reproducibility. It still relies on original sources for it's \"learning\" algorithm, and you still need a person to curate the output. This applies to all sorts of AI-produced media. And with all increases of industrial productivity, the potential of higher output against lower expenses increases the surplus margin for capitalists. So while it may indeed be a cause for a decrease in available work for workers (artists), it isn't necessarily a harmful tool we should categorically reject. Instead, it's another piece of evidence that with the development of new technologies that increase productivity, the capitalist mode of production increasingly fails to constitute a net benefit for society as a whole.",
