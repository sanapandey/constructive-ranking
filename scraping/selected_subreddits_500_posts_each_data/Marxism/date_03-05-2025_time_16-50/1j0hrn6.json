I say take advantage of the situation, quell the anarchic violence and instead focus on keeping the protests going as peacefully as possible and as long as possible. Sell pamphlets, raise banners and put posters to create class solidarity instead of allowing anarchists to incite violence and create mayhem because that will prove detrimental for our revolutionary movement. Keep the peace and unite the people against the common enemy of the bourgeois state. My solidarity goes out to you and may the revolution continue \u270a\ud83d\udea9",

It has encouraged people to protest for their rights, increase anti-capitalistic tendencies in the people, generally collaborating with the associations of the relatives of the victims to increase the reach instead of trying to get the ownership of the thing as many other leftist groups follow this trap. This is another opportunity for the KKE to grow, as political outreach is high from KKE. KKE has proved that it's a proper ML party with a decent quality and planning, but also program. So I believe my comrades will handle it rightly, we will handle it rightly.",

It is Marxist Leninist but it's also endorsing Stalinism and its ideology, so we can say it's ideology is M-L and Stalinism. It's basically supportive of the legacy of Stalin and the model of Stalin, which I agree with as Stalin build a good socialist model for the USSR and supported workers rights.\n\nKKE is the main orthodox ML party in Europe, revisionists were removed from the party in 1991 and real communists are leading it. There are no revisionists in KKE. KKE didnt have the fate of PCI and other such parties. KKE is always fighting for workers rights, practically KKE has a union in every workplace, as PAME (KKE workers union) is working and supporting the rights of millions of workers in Greece. And it's rising too. KKE's student wing Panspoudastiki has secured major victories for the student rights, despite the attempts of neoliberalist government to remove them. I am proud for being aligned with KKE.",

I personally look more to Stalinist views and movements, as Trotskyist movements and views often show things like that socialism in the USSR can't be built and other reformist, even reactionary views. Also trotskyist movements have been courted by the CIA for a good time, and trotskyism is associated with the fake left, which is a big red card for me.

We can only now decide for ourselves what to take from our history of struggle, not which side against each  other. Stalin provided a historical practice, which should be rightfully critiqued and at the same time recognized for its successes based upon its successful influence on world struggle and the replication of achievements in nations that followed a similar path. Trotsky should be understood for providing a at the time experienced critique within the socialist movement, the consequences of that critique should be examined - both for how ant communist agendas took advantage of it and which parts that accurately predicted internal flaws within the USSR that brought forth its collapse in 1991.\n\nIt is pointless in the west (speaking here primarily of North America) that we remain stuck in this debate and not move past this sham divide which divides up our movement into squabbling debates of events a hundred years ago that we cannot effect, merely as individuals we can only take positions on what has occurred. It may help our understanding of how we got to current circumstances under Late Capitalism in the 21st century; however at what cost? How many people are dissuaded because of an organizations over focus on dead figures and century old hairline difference arguments? \n\nEmbrace Historical Materialism.

If they don\u2019t have a concrete plan then how could they possibly be able to achieve permanent revolution? It\u2019s a matter of keeping the battle going, of inspiring the working class with the same ideas. Pamphlets posters and letters are the only way to actualize a socialist revolution, otherwise the current government would just improvise more and more mediocre compromises. Revolution is more than just violence although at its most passionate, violence is involved. Its more about the unionization of the working class towards the common end of achieving a state run by the workers, by seizing the means of production and by redistribution to the people, otherwise this movement would be an unorganized failure.",
