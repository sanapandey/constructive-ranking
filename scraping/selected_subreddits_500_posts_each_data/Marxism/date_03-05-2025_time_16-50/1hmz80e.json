    "selftext": "As the title states I am a conservative who rarely engages with Marxist thought, as I do not believe the majority of the contemporary left is from the Marxist family, and simply didn't take the time to learn about it. I wanted a little clarification on the basic doctrine/overarching idea of Marxism. Lazier conservatives have characterized Marxism as simply a world view of oppressor/oppressed. However from my little research, I have the impression that Marx did not rely on anything similar to the critical theories of the 20th century, but simply attempted to demonstrate via labor theory of value that the proletariat was oppressed/exploited. Would this be fairly accurate in a very broad sense? I just don't want to straw man anybody.",

Here's a good article on it: https://libcom.org/article/value-theory-labour-diane-elson \n\nMarx's project, in outline, was that capitalism has these background laws operating in it that exert themselves no matter how much you try to regulate them away. These background laws will always eventually create a group of people who own nothing and have to get a job. This group of people are forced into a fight with capitalists over their ability to live with any kind of dignity or necessities. From this fight, these people eventually realize a new society is possible and they can organize to make it happen. This new society is a \"free association of producers\" where you can \"hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.\" Basically, it'll be a society where people collectively plan production to maximize how much free time everyone has to do what they want to do.",

Western media, historians, pundits, and even many Western Leftists ie: Democratic Socialists, self-anointed Marxists, even some Fascists with Socialist delusion etc have almost universally lied to everyone about these works-which are far from Marx' only contributions to socialist and economic commentaries of the 19th century. Manifesto is very rudimentary, (by design, it was intended for people who didn't have a lot of time to read) but is almost always spoken of without the inclusion of its important second half *Eighteenth Brumaire of Napoleon Bonaparte* where Marx reacts to the Fall of the Paris Commune and how seemingly victorious Socialist movements can backslide into authoritarian degeneracy and Bonapartism.\n\nThen Das Capital is even more misunderstood. For starters, it's not about Communism, in a number of ways it's not even about Capitalism per se, but of the peculiar *form* Capitalism has taken in the Western World eg America and Europe. For starters, one of the lies you will even hear right here on Reddit about it is that it's difficult to read. It's really only difficult to read if you accept the propaganda you've been fed your entire life by Western Society. It's extremely easy to read once you realize it's largely telling you what you already know and what you've already experienced living under an economic dystopia like the one driving America and Europe but is also in action in lesser forms in other parts of the world. As Prof David Harvey likes to say, if you read Volume 1 of Capital honestly you might even start to feel bad for Capitalists, they're prisoners of their own creation too.\n\nThat said, Volume 1 is often where people stop reading Marx and fall into the trap of psuedo-radicalization eg: \"False Consciousness\" as Engels put it which is really how Leftists collapse into Doomer Conspiracy theory lunacy too. This is another topic entirely, but it's important to understand how Marxism is either very dense or very easy, depending upon how willing you are to believe what you've seen happening right before your eyes in life. One frightening observation that has been made by many late-stage Marxists is that is *some of* *your oppressors are Marxists too* and have read and taken Marx' observations quite seriously. This is why many of the so called \"Capitalist\" states in the West do very Not-Capitalist things to the Global Economy a lot.\n\nThe interest is always the same as the comment above states, the objective is *to disempower workers before they organize and thwart capital's goal of endless accumulation.* Capitalism must be *bent* to the will of people, not allowed to perpetuate itself for its own sake or it will suppress workers. Sometimes it will do so with such effectiveness that capitalism stumbles over itself in victory and suffers a *crisis* better known in the West as a *recession* or a *depression.* \n\nIn any case, one of the biggest myths about Marx you'll hear is that he was anti-capitalist. He wasn't, but he was merely underlining how important it is for workers to be the ones directing the capital-or it will have no direction except to perpetuate itself endlessly, and this will assuredly drive humanity to suffering and death.",

A common misreading spread by Stalinists and some Trotskyists that originally comes from a misinterpretation of Kautsky's based on a vague comment made by Engels. Marx directly contradicts this in the preface to the 1st edition of Capital:\n\n\"What I have to examine in this work is the capitalist mode of pro\u00adduction, and the relations of production and forms of intercourse that correspond to it. Until now, their locus classicus has been England. That is the reason why England is used as the main illustration of the theoretical developments I make. [... ] Intrinsically, it is not a question of the higher or lower degree of development of the social antagonisms that spring from the natural laws of capitalist pro\u00adduction. It is a question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies winning their way through and working themselves with iron necessity.\n(Capital, 1:90-91)\"\n\nMarx is only concerned with his era insofar as it is data to understand the background laws of capitalism that operate in all forms of capitalism. \n\n>In any case, one of the biggest myths about Marx you'll hear is that he was anti-capitalist\n\nSort of correct.\n\n>he was merely underlining how important it is for workers to be the ones directing the capital\n\nCompletely incorrect. Marx was not an anticapitalist insofar as he believed the development of capitalism gave way to communism and therefore the development of capitalism didn't need to be opposed in a luddite way. But he believes that the workers are going to abolish capital and markets and commodity production. The core of *Capital Vol 1-3* is that the background laws of capital assert themselves no matter who is in charge of it! Even when he praises co-operative enterprises in Vol. 3, their relationship to capital is a contradiction to be resolved! \n\n\"The co-operative factories of the labourers themselves represent within the old form the first sprouts of the new, although they naturally reproduce, and must reproduce, everywhere in their actual organisation all the shortcomings of the prevailing system. But the antithesis between capital and labour is overcome within them, if at first only by way of making the associated labourers into their own capitalist, i.e., by enabling them to use the means of production for the employment of their own labour. They show how a new mode of production naturally grows out of an old one, when the development of the material forces of production and of the corresponding forms of social production have reached a particular stage. Without the factory system arising out of the capitalist mode of production there could have been no co-operative factories. Nor could these have developed without the credit system arising out of the same mode of production. The credit system is not only the principal basis for the gradual transformation of capitalist private enterprises into capitalist stock companies, but equally offers the means for the gradual extension of co-operative enterprises on a more or less national scale. The capitalist stock companies, as much as the co-operative factories, should be considered as transitional forms from the capitalist mode of production to the associated one, with the only distinction that the antagonism is resolved negatively in the one and positively in the other. (Capital 3:317)\" \n\nNotice that the worker being their own capitalist is the shortcoming of the cooperative system that must be overcome!",

First, as the feminist reading points out: The correlation between capital and reproductive labour isn't a major point of interest. \nSecond, proposing the limits of capital as internal while at the same time proposing that whatever a post-capitalist may look like, it could be productive forces unleashed. \nWell, I think that's a backslash to grasping the limits of capital as an external obstacle which can be overcome.

It's a major continuous theme by Marx that the fully self-actualized human is one who found a way to regain control of their labor/productivity and self-determine without coercive interference, thus they no longer have a need to divide themselves into an alienated and actual self. All productivity would be purely for the purposes of beauty, art, and expression, essentially (to me) that *creativity* and *productivity* would merge.\n\nThe danger or trap we keep falling into is that industrialists, or maybe even other workers as Techno\\_Femme reminds me, keep trying to use scarcity to coerce workers into slavery. Remember, *workers can become capitalists*. That workers especially can become new hegemons of a world order totally explains American Globalism and the Dollar Regime.\n\nI am personally engrossed by Marx late works right now like *Critique of the Gotha Programme* where Marx gets into why Germany's Social Democrats eg Lasselians etc were dooming themselves to failure by trying to compromise with the German Government to obtain things like working day limits, universal suffrage, etc and later evolved into the Erfurt Program which also contained things Americans would like the sound of like Free Speech laws, Gender equality, etc. You should know that Engels (by now Marx had passed) remained bitterly critical of this program too, contesting that it was largely Anti-Marxist. This fight proved to be the reason for Kautsky and Engels divides near the end of Engels life and I bet it had something to do with Lenin's disdain for Kautsky as well. Anyway, we know that once the World Wars happened, the Kaiser proved Marx correct that the bourgeois state can just roll up concessions to workers at will.\n\nIf you know much about how the First World War started, it's easy to see how the perspective liberal and reactionary historians have in the west about the conflict starting due to a series of mistakes, breakdowns, and bad luck no longer holds out. It really seems that the conflict started because the Kaiser wanted it to so he could crack down on German Socialists. Thats only my conjecture though.\n\nAnyway, chief thing for me is thinking more and more about Work Vouchers and what Marx meant by them. It seems to me that previous Communist Societies eg everything from the American Religious Communes of the Wild West to the Soviet Union all failed at this \"geographic\" point in Marxist development.",

He takes up the LTV, in my opinion, as a way of revealing the self-contradictory quality of value - the worker and the natural world are both the source of value as well as the subjects of it. It's meant to be strange and unsettling, rather than deterministic. Smith thought value should return to its source, treating LTV as an ethic - Marx showed that even if value returns to labor, the worker is still in a state of alienation from the wealth they make. Commodity fetishism is probably the mode closest to the heart of Capital - you think this table is just a simple table, but really this table is bizarre - because its objective features are actually social in nature.",

He critiqued (in the philosophical sense of the word) bourgeois economists like Ricardo, Smith, Lasalle, and so forth to draw out the scientific process that was being only partially elaborated by those economists. Marxist ideology concludes that communism is the outcome that resolves the contradictions of capitalism that were gestured toward but ignored by previous economists, i.e., that capitalism would become so unbearable to the average worker that revolt is an inevitability, an inevitability that can be directed and cured by organizing the working masses to run the economy collectively via a democratic plan.\n\nReducing Marxism to oppressor/oppressed dynamics is silly because it misses the forest for the trees. The existence of an oppressor class and an oppressed class is simply a matter of fact in an *economic system* that stratifies resources. What matters is not *that* oppressors and oppressed exist, but rather how social and economic power is deliberately organized and what the *inevitable consequences* of that stratification are. What matters is the relationship that private property has in society, in a nutshell",

He recognized the struggle between classes as the most fundamental \"contradiction\" in society that, in other words, it determines the way in which societies evolve, particularly how they go into revolt and alter the mode of production as one class overthrows another. Put another way, he refuted that history is determined by individual \"great men.\" He recognized the proletariat specifically as the revolutionary class under capitalism (whereas many other pre-scientific socialists looked towards the peasants and small artisans). He recognized and explained that communism would be an inevitable product of history, that it would be birthed by capitalism, and not be brought about \"ex nihilo\" under self-selected conditions. In brief, he developed what we call historical materialism, and what was then called \"scientific socialism\" (as opposed to the then prevailing utopian socialism).\u00a0\n\n\nAs far as ltv goes, it was never about \"proving\" that the proletariat was oppressed and exploited. Everyone at the time recognized this an immediately perceptible and obvious fact. The problem was that bourgeois economics specifically set about obscuring *how* this exploitation occurred, so Marx set about to expose the mechanism *in order to expose bourgeois economics as bourgeois*.\n\n\nHope that helps",

Marx and Engels never held the view that the basic contradiction of the bourgeois mode of production was to be found in the antagonism between wage labour and capital. Nor, extending this point, did they see the class struggle as the basic contradiction in history. The materialist conception of history, on the contrary, saw the fundamental contradiction in history as one between the development of the productive forces on the one hand and the existing social relations of production on the other. \n\nA glance at the Preface to the Critique of Political Economy proves this to be so. In this short Preface, where the essential points of historical materialism are outlined, there is no mention of classes, or of class struggle. Marx does, however, speak about the \u2018basis\u2019 of society, a basis which lies in the social relations of production, relations which \u2018correspond\u2019 to the stage reached in the development of the productive forces. Only at a given level of the growth of the productive forces do the relations of production take the form of classes, which in turn disappear at a higher level. Class antagonisms are not, therefore, to be taken as things-in-themselves; they are rooted in the deeper, more basic contradictions between the productive forces and the production relations. \n\nThese antagonisms are a driving force in class society solely because they are the expression, the result, of this deeper contradiction, which in the case of capitalism consists of the contradiction between the increasingly socialised nature of production and its ever-narrowing private appropriation.\u201d",

In every society, individuals are divided into classes, each of which is differentiated by their ownership (or lack of ownership) of the means of production. Those who own the means of production are largely able to live off of the products largely made by those who don't own the means of production (in other words, the propertied class is able to leverage its ownership of the means of production to make the propertyless class work for them)\n2. Conflicts of interests tend to arise between those belonging to different classes. While these conflicts are primarily economic, they also appear in the realm of ideas, that is, they also spill over to the sphere of politics, culture, and so on.\n3. These conflicts eventually lead to the replacement of one political-economic system by another, especially when development in production technology makes a new system feasible and the old system unsustainable\n\nIn line with his theory of history, Marx used economic theories prominent during his time (ie classical economics)\n\n1.

Every concept has its own names.\n\nMarxism primarily refers to the concept that labor is in reality equivalent to value, not wages, and that this problem needs to be solved, not ignored.\n\nThat is, the very idea that labor is equivalent to value existed before Marx, it can be traced back to the classical liberal Adam Smith, and before him to Ibn Khaldun. But for Adam Smith it does not follow that the existence of the bourgeoisie is harmful, while for Marx it does. Therefore, Marxism is an even narrower concept, i.e. not everyone who recognizes the equivalence of value and labor is a Marxist, but every Marxist recognizes the equivalence of value and labor. A Marxist also recognizes the need to solve the problem.\n\nOf course, Marxism does not support pro-bourgeois varieties of feminism in the spirit of let's increase the number of women among private owners of large means of production or officials of the bourgeois state. Is it easier for a female worker because a bourgeois woman, and not a bourgeois man, puts the surplus value of her labor into her own account? It must be said that Rosa Luxemburg, Emma Goldman, Clara Zetkin and Sylvia Pankhurst wrote a great deal of criticism of the bourgeois version of first-wave feminism.\n\nAnd not all, not even the dominant part, of contemprorary feminism, including not all intersectional feminism, is Marxist. I've seen plenty of people who constantly say \"white privilege, heterosexual privilege, cisgender privilege, male privilege\" and yet are clearly in favor of preserving capitalism, they just want the bourgeois class to become a little different in its composition.",

Extremely naive and shortsighted, as the only mechanism to give the laborers their due raises, was left entirely in the hands of the leading corporate communist. Why should the corporation suddenly decide to give their workers a raise at the same rate as their CEO and Board of Directors? There is no mechanism for them to do so. \n\nMarx realized this, knew it would be unsustainable in the long run as more of the nation's private wealth is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. \n\n40 years of this ultra-conservative wage erosion, as workers' raises do NOT keep pace with corporate profits, CEO pay raises, and inflation, has brought us to the brink with a higher-than-normal inflationary period under Biden.  And yet, \"the people\" decided to vote in favor of more corporate greed for yet another 4 years. \n\nAs I'm starting off topic, my point is, something is going to go seriously wrong soon. Something is going to break. Whether or not people are Marxists without knowing they are, they will be forced to become so. Just as those who formed unions back in the 1880s through 1920, and overwhelmingly voted in favor of progressive trust-busting governments. This was a period where cooperative businesses, mostly in the food industry, started forming cooperatives such as Ocean Spray, Sunkist, and NABISCO before it turned corporate. \n\nCredit unions are also cooperatives, which is why they are so popular among workers, and especially for union members. Perhaps the best example of a famous cooperative, formed in 1924, is ACE Hardware. Which is why I only shop with local small businesses that benefit greatly from ACE' price advantages they give to small hardware stores.

He instead explains why capitalism is not adequate anymore, why it constantly leads to cycles of crisis and recession, and why these crises worsen over time. He analysed the underlying causes, the inherent contradictions of capitalism, and why we need a new system that can adequately distribute resources instead.\n\nThe capitalists have to make profit to stay competitive and survive, they have to reinvest into the cycle of production. In order to make profit, they don't pay workers as much as they produce, but it's not a \"bad\" thing in a moral sense, that's just how a system based on competition between individual producers works, they take risks and need to make profits by extracting surplus labour. To keep costs low, they make sure the \"necessary\" amount of work (your wage, the amount of money you need to survive) stays as \"short\" as possible, by increasing productivity (like by investing in technologies) as much as possible. \n\nSo if A represents you wage, and B represents surplus labour, it would go from something like this:\n\n|------A------|------B------|\n\nTo this:\n\n|---A---|---------B---------|\n\n\nNow this is problematic because the capitalists end up producing more commodities than workers can even afford, and by reducing A, by investing in technologies rather than labour (which creates surplus value), their rate of profit actually decreases. This structurally forces capitalists to take measures like cutting wages, outsourcing labour, or laying off workers... so then even fewer people can afford the commodities they're producing!\n\nMarx's analysis of capitalism shows that those crises aren't just accidental, they're built in capitalism itself, this is why he says we need to move beyond capitalism, towards a system that distributes goods based on human needs rather than profit.",
