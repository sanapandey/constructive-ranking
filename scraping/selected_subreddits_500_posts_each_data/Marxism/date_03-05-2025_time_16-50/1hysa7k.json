In my day there were short books by Mandel, Harman and Weeks, all with their own defects to be sure, but still very useful and helped to keep the overall picture in mind when you are rereading Marx and he is taking you down some winding passages. Today of course there are video treatments by Harvey as well. \n\nDuring the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, when I returned to Capital, I also found Harvey's early book The Limits of Capital very helpful.

This is the question I want to answer with my studies of Marxism. My answer so far is something like, Marxism is the philosophy of creation through universal criticism of that which needs to be criticized. Does that seem fair, or am I way off the mark? The problem with that view, as I see it, is that I don't understand where the \"creation\" part comes in if all you have is \"criticism\".

                            "body": "Sorry for my late reply.\n\nThere is nothing to envy to, hence I was only lucky to be born in Germany and to go to university. Also, I won't consider myself as an expert. I mostly like Marx' early work where he develops the thoughts of alienation of the worker towards their own work and products. Instead of his later works (which are remarkable) he doesn't go that deep into economics and keeps it simple.\n\nFor me personally Marxism is bound to the idea of Materialism, where everything in the universe connects and relies to each other. So, there is nothing like an individuum that develops from it\u2019s inner core exclusively by itself like many European philosophers worked out through their lifetime (i.e. Platon, Descartes, etc..). I don\u2019t want to go into deep detail, but when you take this idea much further it brings you to the point that every mental thought is taught by humans towards humans and everything is learned from humans by humans, like languages, ideologies, etc. by sharing. So creation, in my opinion towards Marx, is based on the sharing of ideas, knowledge and thoughts of humans over time. Marx explains this difference between humans and animals with the example of bees. He writes that the worst architect at least plans in his mind before he starts building instead of a bee, even if bees are more efficient. Later on Adorno will add the term \u201caesthetics\u201d towards this topic to differ the human furthermore in relation to animals. When it comes to criticism, you have to understand it as a fight or dismantling of resistance. Horkheimer has a beautiful part in one of his abstracts, where he defines humans as beings finding and facing resistance in nature. As soon as humans face resistance, they start to dismantle it or at least to think about the dismantling. That\u2019s where the creation takes part as \u201cwork\u201d, also in consideration by what I\u2019ve written before, by the usage of the knowledge someone learned before. This idea is also found in Hegel\u2019s synthesis, the so called \u201cexternalization\u201d. In German Hegel uses the term \u201cEnt\u00e4u\u00dferung\u201d which describes it much better and relates to the term \u201cEntfremdung\u201d (\u201calienation\u201d) which Marx uses later on.\n\nAdorno takes this concept furthermore into the stage of adolescence, where a juvenile has to resist his parents, which is really important for the personal development. Unfortunately, I, as a teacher, can observe that many young students lose this natural behavior, as more and more parents don\u2019t provide resistance towards the demands of their children. So at least I try to be the part whom they have to \u201cdismantle\u201d, they have to criticize, just to get them to critical thinking.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of my basic thoughts about the \u201ccore\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d of Marxism philosophy. And please don\u2019t criticize too harsh me for my English, as it\u2019s really hard for me to describe my philosophic thoughts in my second language \ud83d\ude09\n\nP.S.: There is maybe one thing, that is really interesting \u2013 even if Marx never ever mentions him in his papers, my professors and I were 100% sure that he must have read Aristotle, because you can find so many parallels, especially when it comes to the term \u201cwork\u201d.",

No but seriously your English is great.\u00a0\n\nI read a letter by Marx to Feuerbach (11 August, 1844) in which he criticises the Berliners of Literatur-Zeitung\u00a0as basically worshipping the idea of criticism. He says that this criticism \u201dis confronted by the whole of humanity as a mass, an inert mass, which has value only as the antithesis of intellect.\u201d (Im sure you can look up the German version of this letter if the English is too difficult). What you wrote about criticism and deconstruction reminded me about this. But here Marx seems to view criticism as meaningless on its own. Does this mean that Marx thought of criticism and deconstruction as integral parts of something else?\u00a0\n\nThe reason i find criticism to be at the heart of Marx is because it seems to me to be the basic idea of his historical dialectic. \u201dThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle\u201d presumably implies that history and society needs to change, which is just what his 11th thesis on Feuerbach says: \u201dPhilosophers have only tried to understand the world. The point is to change it.\u201d So history is a dialectical struggle between classes, and this must be changed somehow. In the 18th Brumaire Marx explores the problems with progress: \u201dMen make their own history, but not of their own free will; not under circumstances they themselves have chosen but under the given and inherited circumstances with which they are directly confronted. The tradition of the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the minds of the living.\u201d And so far the only solution Marx gives (at least that I know of) is in a letter to Arnold Ruge (September 1843): \u201dIf constructing the future and settling everything for all times are not our affair, it is all the more clear what we have to accomplish at present: I am referring to ruthless criticism of all that exists, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSo it seems to me that Marx views humanity as interconnected (or socialist) in the way you talked about, but that class society divides us and that the way forward must be to ruthlessly criticise all that exists, or all that resists against us (which is similar to what you were talking about, although perhaps not as dramatic). What I don\u2019t get is where the creative part is? If the fundamental method of progress is criticism then there can be no creation. Right?\n\nI would love to know your thoughts on this.\u00a0",

David Harvey's companions on vol 1 and 2 will help you when studied alongside the original 1 and 2 volumes,and after all that you should also read the GRUNDRISSE, a masterpiece, it is all there though in raw form, that's why you should read it last, IMHO, good luck",

I damn sure didn\u2019t. Marx\u2019s method is much more complicated than even he let on. It\u2019s only at the end of Capital Vol 3 that you will completely understand the beginning. \n\nCapital is a self-reproduce whole, a totality, an \u201cautomatic subject\u201d as Marx says in vol 1 ch. 4. He reproduced this totality through a dialectical process, which moves from abstract categories to concrete categories, eg from value (abstract) to price (concrete). \n\nPrice is the non-identical and necessary form of appearance of value. Without first understanding value, you cannot understand price. So Marx starts with value and develops the categories necessary to understand why value necessarily takes the form of price (ie the simple, expanded, and universal forms of value laid out in Vol 1, Ch. 1, section 3). \n\nHere\u2019s a link with some more links to resources:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-long-did-it-take-you-to-read-Capital-by-Karl-Marx/answer/Marshall-Solomon?ch=17&oid=249564957&share=97f1facb&srid=uglqJ&target_type=answer",

Nor do I put forward a dogmatic approach of 'sticking to Marx'; Marxists should engage with works further than those of Marx, that is without a doubt. That being said, there is a need to understand contemporary capitalism and look for new weapons to fight and overthrow it. To do so, we must turn to Marx's methodological tools. Otherwise, we are susceptible to the error of being able to recite by heart Gonzalo's interview, without having watered our toes in Marx's critique of ideology or his theory of the turnover of capital. And, to be clear, you may read Gonzalo and I strongly encourage everyone to engage with all this vast wealth of theory that has been developed.

It is important to have in mind that the *Communist Manifesto* is a party statute; a pamphlet that was written for Communist League, whose founding members were, amongst others, Marx and Engels. It is a political work and an announcement to the general public regarding the goals of communists of the time. Its aim is to make clarifications and respond to attacks from different kinds of political opponents. As stated in the beginning of the book: *\"It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself\"*. I can assume you're mostly referring to the so-called (usually by right-wingers, such as Jordan Peterson, who haven't gone past the *Manifesto*, while still misreading) '10 tenants of communism'. Without doubting their relevancy today, in times when free education, for example, is still under attack and not accessible to everyone, it's important to note that communism does not have tenants, nor rules, nor how-to steps. As Marx and Engels wrote in *The German Ideology*: \"*Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality \\[will\\] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things.* ***The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence****.\"* I think the final sentence says it all.",

And it is also true that most of Engels' works are easier to read, given their format or the language he uses. Before I respond, I'd like to make it clear that there is no Marxist-o-meter, so one can measure how Marxist they are. Indeed, to be a Marxist is to be a student of Marxism and that is a never-ending process of learning and practicing. My objection to reading lots of Engels and not as much of Marx would be simply that that would lead to skipping and ignoring loads of theoretical innovations, as demonstrated in books like \"*The Capital\"*, *\"The German Ideology\", \"The Grundrisse\"* and *\"The 1844 Manuscripts\",* four (or six, if you include all three volumes of *\"The Capital\"*) books that I consider to be, without exaggerating, the most important works of Marxist literature, that really set the fundamentals of Marx's analysis, critique and epistemological tools, things all Marxists should become familiar with. That being said, these books may appear heavy or dense to a beginner. For that reason, I also recommend texts like *\"Value, Price and Profit\"* and *\"Wage Labour and Capital\"* that serve as an introduction to some of Marx's core concepts regarding his critique of political economy. For more recommendations and a general guide, you could check my post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1hlll97/ultimate\\_marx\\_reading\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1hlll97/ultimate_marx_reading_guide/)\n\nIn any case, my point would be that Marx's works are not substitutable and we should drive away from the idea that what is written in the works I mentioned or some others (would also add *\"The Poverty of Philosophy\"* there) is marginal or secondary. Within them, Marx lays the foundations for, not just a pre-made analysis, but a powerful toolbox that aids us in our understanding of contemporary struggles and, most importantly, reminds us that *\"the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.\"*\n\nAnd, lastly, I would personally suggest not rushing reading (something I've done couple of times in the past and have regretted it). A combination of excitement to learn about all these different concepts and a feeling that one must know everything all at once, which is intensified in Reddit and other social media, due to debate culture, may lead one to not take their time and appreciate the importance of theory. The antidote to that is to learn collectively: you could join a reading circle or create one of your one with comrades who share similar concerns with you. It's difficult, but it helps the process of learning and grounds it to what really matters: building community and partaking in collective struggles.",

So, I welcome correction or a better explanation from someone who understands Marx better! \n\nBut as I currently interpret it, there is overlap between Marx & anarcho-communism- but Marx does not seem to think it is possible to jump from capitalist control to a true communist society. As I understand it he advocates for a state that will work towards the classless, stateless society ultimately. \n\nAs far as anarchism, however, there tends to be a strict dedication to the will of the people and transferring power directly to their hands. \n\nOn one hand, I can understand why Marx doesn't consider this radical jump to a society without familiar ways of ordering and structuring society plausible or sustainable. He has been right, it seems- external forces tend to squash and take over anarchist movements. \nI think even after a revolution, the society that springs up afterwards will often inevitably rhyme with the power structures or oppressors before it. This seems to be a real danger for socialist states. \nAnarchy does tend to avoid these rhymes, because it is such a different manner of ordering society. Instead of the state ordering things, the people do in a decentralized manner. But anarchist movements seem very susceptible to being sqashed or absorbed by more powerful movements. \n\nI'd recommend watching the documentary about the anarchists in the Spanish Civil War if you want to ser an example of how an anarchist society might function. https://youtu.be/HAEhRRDvHHQ?si=UeFkmfZw3NtaqFvE\n\nI tried to answer but I'm really too tired to be talking about this!",

                            "body": "In short, no, he was a real Marxist, and more of an orthodox Marxist than most of his critics at the time or since.\n\nA lot of non-marxist leftists dislike him because of some of the more authoritarian measures used by the bolsheviks during and after the russian revolution, in particular the purging of the \"mensheviks\" which were a minority faction during the revolution composed primarily of social democrats, anarchists etc. \n\nSome Marxists, like Chomsky for example consider Lenin a \"right wing derivation\" of marxism, in that he opposed immediately running the economy along the lines of worker co-operatives and instead opted for a state planning model. I would characterise this idea as idealistic and it ignores the historical context of the time, namely that the soviet union was under siege from numerous capitalist countries simultaneously, to the point that the bolsheviks didn't actually expect the revolution to survive unless the german revolution which happened at the same time also succeeded (which as it happens, it didn't). Russia also had nowhere near the level of development that you could convert the whole country to worker co-operatives and call it a day. Something like this would have worked in the more developed capitalist countries like Germany or the US (and indeed the brief german revolution established this model), but russia had almost zero industrialisation.\n\nAs a means of developing Russia's productive forces Lenin proposed \"state capitalism\" - essentially  a centrally planned economy where the government extracts surplus value from workers, instead of capitalists, with that surplus being used to develop the wider economy. In his view this is still \"capitalism\" because of the extraction of surplus value. Industrialising quickly was important as there was almost zero chance that the revolution would survive unless the economy could develop to a point where the soviet union's military could stand up to the capitalist powers quite literally invading it at the time.\n\n  \nIn Marxist terms what lenin and the bolsheviks were forced to do is react to the \"material conditions\" of Russia. This is something Marx wrote about, and he even uses the phrase of \"tactics that appear to contradict the end goal\" in order to develop socialism. Anarchists, \"left wing communists\" etc. are often overly idealistic and believe that socialism can be constructed regardless of material conditions. In this respect Lenin is actually **more** of an orthodox Marxist than most other leftists. He understood that marxism is not about idealism, and you cannot immediately construct a stateless, classless society irrespective of material conditions. Marx argued that society needs to go through capitalism before socialism in order to develop productive forces. The inherent contradictions of capitalism lead to the immiseration of conditions for workers, which eventually leads to them forming a revolutionary struggle which leads to the overthrow of the bourgeoise. This new \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" is socialism, or the lower stage of communism. The goal of this government is to further develop productive forces to the point where a stateless, classless society is feasible, a process which Marx predicted could take decades or even hundreds of years.\n\n**idealistic communists/other leftists believe you can essentially jump to the higher stage of communism without this interim process**. More often than not this is because they haven't read Marx in detail and believe that Marxism is just a critique of capitalism and a suggestion of what comes next, when in reality it is an attempt at a science of developing society towards the end goal of a stateless/classless society. There were socialists pre-Marx, but Marx's primary contribution was dispelling of utopian notions and realising that the development of socialism was a process which depended on the development of material conditions. In this sense, Lenin is the closest continuation of Marx's beliefs, as opposed to more utopian socialists.\n\nLenin also repressed the power of workers councils, primarily because many were loyal to mensheviks.\n\nimo this ended up being a mistake because it ended up leading to the bureacratisation of the soviet union. The repression of the councils was justifiable at the time but this policy should have been reversed later and the government should have done more to empower workers and make the state genuinely democratic. By this point though Lenin was long dead and we're talking about Stalin and his successors. Trotskyists believe that Stalin was the turning point in the soviet union because he didn't do anything to prevent the increasing bureacratisation of the soviet union, and this lead to a development of a bureacratic class with contrary interests to the proletariat. I'm not a trotskyist but I think this critique is more or less correct.",

And, the core  of the theory is that when there are two mutually exclusive forces, that encounter each other, a synthesis is produced, after they cancel each other out. And the synthesis, or, left overs, after a battle to the death, is a superior product, as compared to what came before. \n\nWhich, that's just a philisophical application of darwin's \"survival of the fittest\" ...... \n\nHe called the two opposing forces, in conflict, dialectics. di, being latin, for doubled. \n\nThe weak point, to his entire theory, was that dialectics only applies, when there are two mutually exclusive forces, in conflict with each other. So, his theory actually has nothing to say to a society, for example, where the proletariats are happily doing their own thing, and their thing doesn't interfere, or intersect, or compete for space with the thing that the ruling classes are busily doing. \n\nIn other words, his theory begins, when neither the proletariat nor the ruling class can do their thing. Where, there's mutual  exclusivity. In other words, one of them has to go, in order for the other to survive. That's the point where his theory begins. It begins at there having to be a fight to the death. And he calls that fight to the death dialectics, and his theory states that whoever survives, is synthesized. in other words, they became better, because of the fight. It's not clear whether the fight made them better, or the fight proved that they were already better, or if they were capable of becoming better, if challenged, and tested, and opposed....\n\nit's really light on that kind of pre-suppositional foundations for what his theory actually assumes about reality. And so, he basically ends up just glorifying a fight to the death, and saying, whoever wins is the superior being., Marx and the German people's World War II doctrine of Manifest Destiny is basically the same thing. Whoever wins is the the one who SHOULD win because there were superior and won because of superiority etc....\n\nAnd, of course, his manifesto, does not comment on any scenario outside of this fight for the death. And, a suppressed, enslaved, exploited slave class, rising up to eliminate and murder the ruling class, did not need Marx's help, to do what they do. The same scenario played out exactly the same, before Marx, as after Marx. \n\nAnd, communism, which is effectively a doctrine of universal fraternity, and absolute non-violence, is actually incompatible with Marx's manifesto. Because, the manifesto says that the superior person is a product of the results of a fight to the death. So, he did not provide any ideological basis for pivoting, from murdering the entire ruling class, into peace. In fact, properly adhered to, any country that eliminated their ruling class, if they obeyed the letter of the doctrine, would then pit the poor against each other. The violent fight to the death, would not stop when the ruling class was eliminated. Because Marx's theory proposes that the fight is neccessary, good, required, etc. So, in actuality, if you keep trying to fulfill his theory, then you end up with eternal, perpetual round robin, where the working class fights each other to the death, and then the slave class gets their chance to fight to the death, and the entire structure of the society that results, is structured around a constant fight to the death fought between everyone and everyone else....\n\nwhich, incidentally, that IS what happened. In China, with Mao, he supervised the fights to the death, and they continue to this day. Stalin did the exact same. He folllowed Marx's doctrine, which prescribes a fight to the death, that never ends, and he pitted all of russia against all of russia, and eliminated most of the country, which means that he was following Marx's theory correctly.",
