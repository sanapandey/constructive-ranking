They said that they would get back to me. This is the first time I am organising with any party, and was wondering what I should expect in the process. Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",

They'll want to discuss politics with you so that you can get a sense of what we're fighting for and they can better understand what you believe. They'll probably either ask to meet up with you in person or invite you to a larger meeting.\n\nThe only exception would be if we don't yet have a branch nearby where you live. In that case, a leading member regionally or nationally will reach out to you and we can help you build a communist cell in your area.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you have about getting involved and I'm happy to answer. The same obviously goes for the local comrade that reaches out to you.",

I'm in the German section and we have the founding congress of our RCP at the end of November.\n\nI've been a member of this international for nearly a decade now.\n\nTheir dedication to theory is often criticised but it is incredibly necessary given the tasks it sets itself: building the revolutionary party whose aim is the overthrow of capitalism on a global scale.\n\nA daunting task indeed, but it won't happen on its own.",

I never felt like i've been in a Communist organisation but in a theory reading organisation where i need to put alot of time and money in it. They have a really radical approach with finances, i mean, i get it, you need money to build a party. Yes. But its a different thing if you put social pressure on young comrades so they pay more to the organisation. That was a thing i never really liked and put me completely off. I dont go on theyre theory because its trotskyism with the ideas of Ted Grant, there are other threads which discuss this better than iam able to right now.\n\nBut to youre question, they will contact you for a Meeting and then they wanna discuss some stuff with you about history, theory, and theyre positions on the topics.",

The dominant view of capitalist crises in RCP seem to be Luxemburgs theory of imperialism, which has been heavily criticized pretty much since its inception, not the least by Lenin. This is rather weird considering the heavy reading of Lenin in the organisation, but this was my perception at the time (I must preface this by saying that I was a part of IMT, not the current RCP. I was also a part of a scandinavian branch so it might aswell be due to local issues).   \nI think, though, that the bulk of theorizing in the organisation comes from Alan Woods, which I am fairly certain has yet to read Capital volume three, or atleast subcribes to a really narrow reading. This guy also gives off a culty vibe  \n  \nBut again, this organisation was a crucial step in my own understanding and radicalisation and I will never forget that. Maybe see what its like and learn what you can, but also arm yourself with a healthy level of scepticism <3 If it gets too culty, just leave.",

The RCP has more than proven that we have a zero-tolerance policy to abuse, and absolutely no one, not even leadership, is exempt from consequences. The Canadian section expelled their founder last year after a victim came forward. \n\nThe allegations that leadership somehow protects abusers is sectarian gossip that has its stronghold on Twitter. I would bring any questions you have about this to your meeting with the RCP members in the UK. They should be fairly open about talking about the allegations, the policy we have, the procedures we have in place, etc. But we do not discuss the details of any cases because we prioritize protecting the victims, who do not deserve to have those details aired out in public. The entire membership closes ranks on that idea - our priority is the safety of the victim, and of the organization as a whole.",

As far as I'm aware the landscape of communist orgs in the UK is not that good, although I am also not that familiar with it. I'd always recommend trying to find an organization that does not define itself narrowly and strictly as \"Trotskyist\" or \"ML\" or any other specific Marxist tendency. It has led and will only lead to endless sectarianism, a hopeless strategy for the communist movement. We need a broader Marxist movement.",

The fact of the matter is, though, that we *need* a party that can be the centre of a mass movement. In most places, it is far more likely that an existing organisation will take on this role rather than a completely new organisation. Accordingly, it is our task as communists to identify and join the organisation that we think is most likely to be the origin of the mass party. You must get to know and trust people there, and organise with them to make the party materialise, that is our only hope. Most organisations in Western countries have major flaws, but they also almost always contain a good amount of trustworthy comrades. Find them. In the US, MUG seems like a decent option, but there might also be others I don't know about.",
