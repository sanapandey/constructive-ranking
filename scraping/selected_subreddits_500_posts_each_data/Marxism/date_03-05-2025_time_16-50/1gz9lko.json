    "selftext": "I am reading capital for the first time and am a little confused about the declaration of exchange value being based on hours of labor: exchange value should not be purely based on amount of labor. For example, image two commodities of equal labor hours, say it takes 1 hour to get 5 apples and also one hour to get wood for a fire,  if it\u2019s really cold and you need wood for a fire you will give 100 apples (20 hours worth of labor) to get wood for the fire\u2026 so current conditions influence exchange value by changing their need/usefulness but this is separate from use value? Hope this makes sense ",

Market price fluctuates around real value based on supply and demand among other factors. Profit is made by selling goods at or above their value.",

            "body": "Marx takes the category of exchange-value from Ricardo's defition of value: an equilibrium price for a class of commodities whose actual price fluctuates around via supply and demand. The difference is that Marx differentiates exchange-value and just value. Try to understand why he does this and it'll help you understand these first 3 chapters! \n\nI also recommend this secondary resource that is super helpful:\n\nhttp://digamo.free.fr/elson79-.pdf",

You too can one day understand the necessary subjectivities in their objective relations if you just pick up and read Capital.",
