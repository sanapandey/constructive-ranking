But I've been looking for great history channels that aren't super academic and sophisticated (I already have the ones when I need that), but also I don't want that curiosity type channels like \"what food Napoleon enjoyed\".\n\nCan someone recommend some? It's doesn't need to be marxist, but at least decent",

You can find it on Spotify. Each season is one topic and pretty in depth and entertaining, and from a Marxist perspective.",

It basically identifies historical myths and breaks them down. I really enjoy it. If you have Spotify, you can find it [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ytDMmq6fnfalgSDNoer9a?si=aqTjCziHSB607gAYrRfzig)",
