    "selftext": "so i was recently reading an academic article that talked about franco basaglia, the psychiatrist who basically was the main reason that mental institutions in italy were abolished and a lot of the his views were marxist. he also brought class consciousness to mental patients in italy\u2026 in the article they mentioned fanon and a lot of times i forget he was also a psychiatrist lol\u2026 anyway, im a person who is a ML but also suffers a lot from different mental illnesses. it\u2019s a huge part of my life and i struggle to find ways to treat myself currently\u2026 however, the way i view the world allows me to see that a lot of these conditions are a result of the way things are currently and i have been looking for ways i can alleviate symptoms and learn how as a community we can come together and help each other in this aspect. i really like fanon but never delved into how he applied marxist theory to psychiatry and mental health\u2026 i do know he thought that institutions were bad for that and instead thought having community would help. i was wondering if anyone knew of any relevant readings from him regarding this topic? i feel like i could learn a lot from that. feel free to recommend any other marxist writings about the topic too!

Reading Fanon, if I may suggest, read him as a colonized person/worker first rather than a Marxist first. For me, that makes his work make more sense through a \"Marxist lens\" (if that makes sense).",
