Real life - nature, society, science, economics, etc\u2026 - doesn\u2019t fit into neat categories. Dialects places this, along with many other premises as the starting point of its method of analysis.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re not entirely incorrect in saying that the petty-bourgeois \u201cstill has to sell their labor power to survive\u201d. But the main thing that must be considered when analyzing class is the relationship to the means of production.\u00a0The petty-bourgeois, in many instances, employees workers, thus expropriating surplus labor value from the worker and giving it to themselves in the form of profit.\u00a0The petty-bourgeois does not work for a wage in the same way that a member of the working class does.\u00a0The petty-bourgeois is an owner of the products of the productive process that they are employing in their enterprise. The profit they glean from selling their products, in many cases produced by workers the petty-bourgeois employs, on the market is their own to spend. The workers do not get a say in how the profit is spent.\n\nThere are many features of the petty-bourgeois that are in common with the working class, but the dialectical materialist (Marxist) analysis incorporates a wholistic understanding of a classes role in society. It\u2019s incredibly important to remember that real life has gradients to every aspect of this social analysis. Real individuals don\u2019t fit into the neat categories that we want them to, and to understand something deeper you have to see the concrete social dynamics at play in the context of their lives. The petty-bourgeoisie is not a homogenous group of people and it\u2019s actually a pretty gross over simplification and distortion to say that just because someone has to sell their labor power to survive they are a member of the working class.\u00a0",

The fact that they have to do labor, that they, in general, aren't appropriating the surplus value of *other* workers (at least not to the extent of being able to accumulate capital), is what makes them not \"haute\" (big) bourgeoisie, but they are not proletarian either. They're working class in the broad sense of having to work to live, but not proletarian.",

They tend to be a group that has always been anti revolutionary, see themselves as better and above the proletariat, look down on those that dont manage money well, and often exploit their family's labour as well as their own. Margaret Thatcher was a perfect distillation of these ideologies. \n\nToday because of things like AI there fortunes of traditional petite bourgeoisie (plumbers, electricians etc) are much better than new petite bourgeoisie (insecure academic workers, translators or other intellectual self employed) so it no longer makes sense to speak of a single petite bourgeoisie.

They are in a position to transition either into the Bourgeoisie or the Proletariat.\n\nWorking for a wage is not that relevant to whether they are Bourgeoisie or Proletariat. It depends on their relationship with the means of production. Proletarians are the class that owns none of the means of production and earns wages exclusively by selling their labor. Their wages aren't high enough to allow them to buy means of production. They earn just enough money to pay rent and buy food.\n\nPeasants aren't Proletarian because they either own land in some form and are essentially proprietors. They can be extremely poor and earn very little, but proprietorship is what makes them different from proletarians.\n\nThe Petit Bourgeoisie earn more than enough to own the means of production. They can rent shops to sell goods or they can hire workers and laborers. They can buy vehicles to deliver goods. They have a wide variety of ways to buy means of production and implement their own production even if it's small.\n\nThis is also why modern capitalism doesn't behave the way it did in the 1920's (paying extremely poor wages resulting in strikes and unionization). The classes have all shifted around but haven't really been re-classified. Unionized trade workers make double what a store manager makes. A Fast food worker makes more than steel workers in the 1920's. A huge portion of the US laboring classes are likely classified as petit Bourgeois. But a better term is what Lenin called the parasitic Rentier Bourgeoisie, the people who earn enough to invest in stocks or loans and make money off of interest rates. And with things like crypto currency, it's extremely common for the poorest classes to buy investments. So the new tendency among workers to behave like capitalists results in them refusing to unionize or strike or do anything in their class interest.",
