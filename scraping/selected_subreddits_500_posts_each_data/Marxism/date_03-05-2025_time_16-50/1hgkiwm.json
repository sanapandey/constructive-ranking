I want to be able to understand how contemporary Marxian critique of political economy, or critical political economy, engages with economics and political economy, and I feel like I need to be able to digest knowledge of economics as a discipline. I'm very new to economics so any suggestions are welcome :-) ",

            "body": "I would read *Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism* by Lenin. As relevant today as it was in 1916 when he wrote it. As he also wrote it for publication in Russia, there are hardly any political conclusions or commentaries in the work (any such commentary would have made the book banned by the Tsarist censors), therefore it is a purely economic work. It analyses what imperialism is from a Marxist economics standpoint. Well worth a read, especially if you want to understand imperialism, which as we see today is still alive and kicking.",

Through loans, private investment, offshoring of production, etc. But since the 1950s at least, developing nations actually have the problem of home-grown capital fleeing to industrialized nations and loans from imperialist powers are more likely to go to other imperialist powers rather than developing nations. The only nation still doing capital exports the way Lenin describes is China through the Belt and Road initiative. Loans given by the IMF or other imperialist tools generally have stipulations that the nation must keep their markets open to the global econony and forgo any trade protectionism. In Lenin's time, as he describes, stipulations of loans more often had clauses about spending a certain amount of money on goods from the country loaning money. \n\nMany countries are given the choice between China's more \"traditional\" imperialism and the new imperialism of the IMF and USA and they consistently pick China. IMO Wallerstein has a good read on this situation in World Systems Analysis: An Introduction. \n\nBut we have to recognize that, since Lenin's time, the economic bases of imperialism has changed drastically. So has the political basis (from colonies to neo-colonies)",

It certainly is a worthwhile pursuit, and a meaningful contributor to heterodox economics to this day.\n\n\"how does it engage with contemporary economics\"\n\n\\- Marx predated neoclassical economics. So, while modern marxists may critique it (there's not much possible collaboration or common ground between them), Marx was not alive to see neoclassical economics, only classical.\n\nIn my journey, the ultimate guide to contemporary economics was steve keen's debunking economics. it will show you the models you are about to experience, or already have and show you tens or hundreds of lethal critiques to them, drawing on many scholars, including marx.\n\nThe reason i moved away from a marxist critique of neoclassical economics was that i found institutional - ecological economics much better (not that it and  marxism are at loggerheads, they just focus on different things a lot - though you will find marx mentioned and talked about there much too!). It was Kapp's \"the social costs of business enterprise\" that blew any possible faith i had in these kinds of markets or NCE to understand or address climate change, for different reasons to Marxism's critiques of either, so thats the direction I put my efforts towards since it seemed underappreciated and very important.\n\nIm tired so cant think of more to say, but feel free to reply or shoot me a dm if you'd like to talk more.

I'm reading Stephanie Kelton's\"The Deficit Myth\" right now which my friend says counters the labour theory of value. I don't think it really does since it doesn't try to explain where the value of money comes from in the first place. She mostly argues that debt for sovereign nations is essentially not real to a point since they can create money and it puts money into their private sector. Also the nations we lend money to buy our bonds back (especially China). She also argues that we should invest in government funded full employment even if we need to go into debt. \n\nI find these arguments sorta utopian and class-less. Like companies don't want full employment at good wages since it undermines the very goal of capital. There's also the case that if her thesis was correct, developed nations would have no trouble and wouldn't be imposing austerity on their citizens.

I am mostly assuming you want to get some familiarity with mainstream economic ideas so you know exactly what it is that Marxism attacks.\n\nGeneral economic textbooks - I do not know any recommendations because I only had economics in high school (mix of Keynesian and neoclassical), added downside if you're new is that lots of mainstream economics and \"economics 101\" is based on neoclassical economics, which Marxist economics is hostile to. On the other hand, you gotta know your enemy. In general, it helps if you know what economics generally focuses on, but reading up on what neoclassical economics consists of already gets you there a lot of the way.\n\nIn terms of classical political economy, there is lots of critique of Marx himself, on Smith, Ricardo, Quesnay (physiocrats). I had an intro course on PE a couple of years back but unfortunately do not have the syllabus with readings anymore, but I did have to read a lot of excerpts from **Frank Stillwell's** ***Political Economy: The Contest of Economic Ideas*** **(2012)**. Based on the table of contents, it looks like a good general coursebook on political economy. Covers both classical and contemporary stuff.\n\nPluto Press also has two critical companion's on macroeconomics as well as microeconomics by Ben Fine. Definitely looks interesting, but I haven't read them and it might presuppose some familiarity with contemporary mainstream economic theory.\n\nThough they are not Marxist and not as radical in quite the same way, I can still recommend so called \"heterodox\" economists like Ha Joon Chang (**Bad Samaritans, Economics: The User's Guide** and  **23 Things they Don't Tell you About Capitalism**) and Mariana Mazucatto (**The Entrepreneurial State, The Value of Everything & Mission Economy**. They have both written books for a mainstream audience and attack lots of the presuppositions of contemporary mainstream economic theory even if they're nowhere near as a radical as Marxism would require. But because mainstream economics is so pervasive in popular thinking about many different topics, their books are still a good and accessible approach.\n\nYanis Varoufakis is great, definitely more Marxist adjacent and also has some general audience books. Grace Blakeley is also a great author and a Marxist! Have a look at her books and her writing for Tribune magazine to get a feel for her criticism on current affairs.",
