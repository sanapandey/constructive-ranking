However my bf (who is a monarchist btw) made me notice that my choice of furniture and decor may be a bourgoise legacy and go against my socialist beliefs (i'm actually AnCom but that doesn't really matter),  is he right? I didn't think about that that way.",

The bourgeois attitude would be to not care about sustainability, the origins and labor of the item and go out of your way to spend all your money and effort in decor just because you can (it's a privilege). The fact that you're even thinking about this shows you care. \n\nArt and design can be extremely mindful and empowering hobbies (I myself am a thrifting maximalist because colors bring me joy and energy). But not when it's about status and feeding an ego. Bragging about and showing off all the stuff you have VS. respecting and using it to make your own personal space to thrive in.., see what I mean?\nImo 'burgeois' is not a default title that the furniture has because of its past, it changes depending on the intent and new purpose. But stuff should mean or symbolise something to you, otherwise it's just stuff for stuff's sake, and that if anything is bourgeois.",

I've got most of my furniture at goodwill and thrift stores cause it's the only place I can afford due to poverty wages. since the stuff is already made it would be better to make use of it then waste the labor and materials and buy new stuff. \n\nas for running a thrift store business or using interior design in gentrifying a place or something like that, that could be related to bourgeois politics.",

Stalin did wield a heavy hand against dissent because he had little room for recourse.\n\n>Yeah they can always overthrow anybody anytime but is more like a written agreement\n\nThe USSR had this, it's called the \"right to recall\". If an elected representative of a soviet was not performing their duties correctly or satisfactorily, the people could recall them, remove them, from office and elect another. It didn't require any turmoil from \"overthrowing\" anyone. \n\nI'm not trying to be pedantic here but what you're saying really doesn't make sense logically. \n\nIf there's an agreement between the masses and their government that the masses can nullify the leadership when they aren't performing correctly, then that wouldn't be overthrowing anything. That's just a policy intentionally baked into that system of governance, and the entire affair would be carried out administratively rather than at gunpoint.\n\nUsing the term overthrow would be more appropriate for what the Bolsheviks did to the Tsar and his family.",
