            "body": "Also known as the \"reserve army of labor,\" the idea is that capitalism keeps labor costs low by ensuring there's always a population of unemployed (but seeking to be employed) workers who keep wages low by competing for any availability in the labor market. Additionally, this was not a phenomenon that took place prior to capitalism's dominance - before that point there was not really \"unemployment\" as it exists now. Slaves and serfs cannot become \"unemployed,\" and only those who had actual skills such as craftsmen were the only ones who could be employed in a proto-capitalist sense. Those who were not working for wages or for a master were just subsistence laboring, not \"unemployed.\" Even under capitalism, those who work for themselves are \"self-employed,\" which would be an odd way to describe the relationship between labor and its fruits in a pre-capitalist society. \n\nAdditionally, the harsh competition for low wages in the labor market also makes it harder for the working class to organize against the owning classes because the workers are forced to live hand-to-mouth and don't have the physical and mental energy to envision and organize against the owners.",

If unemployment drops below this number, competition for workers will force wage increases and therefore inflation.  \n\nStrangely enough, even though our economic system \"needs\" that level of unemployment, our political class still demonise the unemployed as though their status is a personal failing.",

That the fear of becoming unemployed and possibly homeless keeps workers obedient fearful to organize. It\u2019s what you said at the end with a little extra. \n\nAnd what about the unemployed that aren\u2019t even counted because they\u2019ve been out of work for so long? And the homeless who aren\u2019t able to work because their conditions are so dire? To me I see that group as advantageous to the ruling class because it keeps workers obedient. I\u2019m guessing Marx didn\u2019t write about these groups.",

His words are archaic but they are not far from our common experience at all. From the communist manifesto:\n\n>No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.\n\nHere he is referencing the experience of the average laborer after receiving their paycheck. One would think it would be an enjoyable experience, receiving the fruits of one's labor - only to find that the bills from your other exploiters have consumed nearly all of it. Landlords come to mind for me.\n\nOr take, for example, this passage:\n\n>The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history.\n\nIf you are American, you will find that this passage covers the dynamics of the populist MAGA movement. It is a movement led overwhelmingly by real estate agents, lawyers, small business owners, police, managers - in other words, the modern face of the middle class. They hate the billionaires, yes, but they absolutely *despise* those beneath them. Their hatred for the capitalist class is due to the tendency for capitalism to liquidate their privileges, *not* because of the injustice per se. Their political program is to return to a mythic past where their privileges were intact (hence Make America Great Again), not to go forward and resolve the problems our society really has. This is why fascists and other right-populists can never be friends to the working class, even temporarily.",

Marx himself had a rather dim view of them, calling them a \"tool for reactionary intrigue\". Modern Marxists do not generally agree with this characterization.\n\nThis population serves a similar function to the reserve army of labor in the sense that they are a threat to any working class people who are employed. The threat of homelessness and destitution serves as a great motivator to keep working for whatever the capitalists are willing to pay you.\n\nHowever, this population is also an indictment of capitalism itself. Take, for example, the disabled - they are excluded from the majority of jobs (and certainly the decent ones) because their labor cannot be profitably exploited by capitalists. Unhoused people are similar - they just don't make enough money to pay for housing at the rate that landlords prefer to sell it at. Those who engage in petty crime generally do so because of the lack of decent job opportunities. It is obscene that our society throws away a whole portion of humanity simply because they do not adequately satiate some wealthy asshole's greed.",

She is a socialist and was actively involved in groups and the 60s movement. I didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about, but I did grow up hearing names and terms.\n\nI\u2019m going to look that up along with the Marx\u2019 phrase you quoted so I can learn more about that.\n\nAnd yes, I agree with the last comment you made. To me what capitalism does to all of us, especially those most impacted, is a continuous series of crimes against humanity. I find myself talking to people about how they need to not look down on or blame homeless people, but have empathy and compassion for them. No one thinks to themselves, \u201cI want to be a homeless person when I grow up.\u201d",
