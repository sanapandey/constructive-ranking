    "selftext": "Communism and Marxism are fundamentally flawed because they are based on an outdated understanding of reality. Marx assumed that wealth could only be created through the exploitation of human labor, as he believed labor was the sole source of value. However, this premise fails when one considers AI and robotics. Wealth can now be generated independent of human labor, completely bypassing the dynamic of exploitation Marx described. His theory doesn\u2019t account for technological innovation that eliminates the need for labor in production, rendering its foundation obsolete. This demonstrates that Marxism is not a universal truth, but a product of its time, limited by the context in which it was conceived.",

Who gets to own the robots that do all the work, and who gets to profit off their labor? The way things are going, the capitalist will, and the people who don't own robots will be left to languish in destitution.\n\nIf capitalist countries thrive so much because of automation, why don't most people see the benefits? The west is more automated than ever, and yet inequality is greater then ever, things are only getting more expensive, austerity is on the rise, home ownership is a pipe dream for most people, etc. And the automation is further used to sow misinformation and control the masses.",

I work with real roboticists (people who actually build or supervise robots in manufacturing, logistics, etc.), and they don't sleep all day while robots do everything. That might change some day, but until then, put down your copy of *I, Robot* and learn about what is actually happening in these fields.\n\n2. Technology like digital information sometimes has a very low cost of reproduction (marginal cost) - if you make Microsoft Word, you don't have to assembly line each copy that someone downloads. Economists, Marxist or not, don't think that Word is worthless. ChatGPT didn't arrive on Earth via magic, either.\n\n3. Not all sectors, industries, or trades produce value via productive labor/classical exploitation. (The easiest example to understand is government employees, who are typically paid via State revenue rather than out of returns on commodities they produce for sale.) People are still harvesting your food and mining the lithium for your computer. So even if AI was a completely autonomous, wealth-producing industry, society isn\u2019t changed until robots do *everything*\u2014including making all basic commodities, themselves, and *deciding* how to run our whole society.\n\nSomeday, robots might achieve the singularity and make compulsory work a thing of the past. You think it's a gotcha, but Marxists love this idea! Marxism is a theory about making itself obsolete, e.g., making a world in which it would literally be a thing of the past\u2014a theory of a capitalist society that no longer exists.  \n  \nIn the meantime, Marxism is a theory about looking at things as they really are, not as Asimov fantasized they could be.",
