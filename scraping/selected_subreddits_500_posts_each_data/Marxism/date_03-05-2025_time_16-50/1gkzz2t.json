    "selftext": "Comrades,\n\nDonald Trump has won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, securing a return to power and an extension of his influence over the political and social fabric of American capitalism. His victory, while shocking to liberals and progressives, offers no surprise to those who understand the nature of bourgeois democracy and the state as an instrument of class power. The task before us is to analyze this event not merely as a shift in personalities or parties, but as a profound revelation of the deep contradictions within American capitalism and the limitations of electoral politics. We must, as ever, seek the historical and material meaning of this development, and understand its implications for the proletarian struggle.\n\nTo understand the significance of Trump\u2019s victory, we must first examine the role that the two-party system plays in sustaining the rule of capital in the United States. For decades, American politics has been defined by an apparent rivalry between the Republican and Democratic parties, yet both are united in their ultimate allegiance to the interests of the capitalist class. The \u201cchoice\u201d offered to the American people every four years is thus not a choice between fundamentally different social systems or visions for society, but rather a choice between different factions within the same ruling class. This bipartisan structure serves a singular purpose: to mask the real workings of class power and to forestall the emergence of an independent, proletarian alternative.\n\nTrump\u2019s return to power is, in one sense, simply the continuation of this pattern. His populist rhetoric and authoritarian policies do not represent a break with the American tradition, but rather an intensification of it. The capitalist class, confronted with the growing crises of inequality, climate catastrophe, and social decay, increasingly resorts to reactionary and authoritarian methods to maintain its rule. Trump\u2019s platform of militarized borders, assaults on democratic rights, and inflammatory nationalism is merely the logical response of a ruling class that feels its power slipping away. The Democrats, while appealing to liberal sensibilities and promising incremental reforms, have shown themselves to be utterly impotent in resisting this drift. They serve only to pacify the working class and divert it from revolutionary struggle.\n\nIn this light, the disillusionment now felt by millions of progressive and liberal voters is both predictable and potentially fertile ground for the growth of revolutionary consciousness. The failure of the Democratic Party to prevent Trump\u2019s re-election, despite their rhetoric of resistance and reform, has exposed the hollowness of their promises. Workers, young people, and marginalized communities who hoped that electoral change could bring meaningful improvement to their lives are now confronted with the stark reality that the state, in its current form, exists not to serve the people but to preserve the interests of a small class of capitalists. This disillusionment should not be ignored, nor should it be met with scorn by Communists. Instead, it presents us with an opportunity to reach out to those who are beginning to see the limitations of bourgeois democracy and to guide them toward a deeper understanding of the class struggle.\n\nHowever, it is not enough simply to criticize the failures of bourgeois democracy. We must also articulate a clear vision of the alternative: a proletarian state, organized around the interests and needs of the working class rather than the dictates of capital. Our task is to build independent working-class organizations\u2014workers\u2019 councils, unions, and community assemblies\u2014that are capable of exercising real power outside the constraints of electoral cycles and bourgeois institutions. These organizations must be grounded in democratic principles, accountable to the proletariat, and oriented toward the dismantling of the capitalist state. In every struggle\u2014whether for labor rights, racial justice, or environmental sustainability\u2014our aim must be to foster class consciousness and to link these struggles to the larger fight for socialism.\n\nTrump\u2019s re-election also highlights the adaptability of bourgeois democracy. In periods of stability, the capitalist state presents itself as a liberal, democratic institution committed to protecting individual rights. But in periods of crisis, it reveals its true character as an instrument of repression. Trump\u2019s campaign promises of \u201claw and order,\u201d his readiness to use military force against protestors, and his appeals to nativist and racist sentiments are not aberrations but strategies. They are designed to channel the discontent of the working masses away from class struggle and toward reactionary scapegoats, whether immigrants, minorities, or political dissidents. In this context, it becomes even more crucial that Communists oppose these reactionary narratives, exposing them as distractions from the true cause of social misery: the capitalist system itself.\n\nThe authoritarian turn in American politics is not unique. Across the capitalist world, from Brazil to Hungary to India, ruling classes are adopting similar strategies to secure their power. These regimes, though different in style, are united by their reliance on repression and nationalism to hold together societies fractured by inequality and injustice. Trump\u2019s victory, therefore, must be understood as part of a global trend\u2014a sign of a capitalist system in decay, increasingly unable to resolve its contradictions through democratic means. International solidarity among the working class becomes all the more essential in this context. Just as capital is organized globally, so too must be our resistance. We must strengthen ties with proletarian movements around the world, learning from their struggles and sharing resources and strategies to combat the reactionary forces that confront us all.\n\nFinally, we must address a dangerous illusion that may persist among certain segments of the disillusioned liberal and progressive masses: the belief that a future election, with a different candidate, could somehow reverse the tide of reaction. This cycle of hope and disappointment, which plays out every four years, is itself one of the primary mechanisms by which the capitalist state maintains control. Each election is framed as a decisive battle for the soul of the nation, and yet, no matter the outcome, the fundamental structures of exploitation and inequality remain untouched. Communists must break this cycle by offering a long-term vision of struggle that transcends the boundaries of electoral politics.\n\nThis does not mean disengaging from all forms of political participation; rather, it means building structures of power that are independent of the capitalist state. These structures\u2014workers\u2019 councils, community assemblies, and independent unions\u2014must serve as the seeds of a new society, capable of exercising real power and laying the groundwork for a revolutionary transformation. They must be spaces for political education, where workers can learn about the nature of the state, the history of class struggle, and the necessity of a socialist alternative. They must also be centers of solidarity, bringing together labor struggles, anti-racist movements, environmental campaigns, and other forms of resistance into a united front against capital.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump\u2019s victory is not merely a setback for liberalism; it is a profound revelation of the capitalist system\u2019s inability to meet the needs of the people. This moment calls for clear-sighted analysis and disciplined organization. We must stand firm in our principles, exposing the illusions of bourgeois democracy and pointing the way toward a proletarian alternative. The path forward lies not in electoral cycles, but in the building of a revolutionary movement that can operate outside and against the capitalist state.\n\nThis is the task history has set before us. Let us meet it with the courage and clarity that our revolutionary forebears have shown. The proletariat does not need another liberal savior; it needs a movement capable of seizing power, dismantling the capitalist state, and building a socialist society. This is our call to action.",

            "body": "Look, I don't want to be one of those leftists who tries to force Marx to be applicable to every modern situation, but this whole event does remind me a lot of what Marx was talking about in general with *The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte*. Sure, the initial section on how Bonaparte's coup related to the 1848 revolution does not necessarily apply here, but it can't be denied that it does draw attention to the ability of demagogues to capture a disorganized working class.\n\nMarx describes the French peasantry whose vote brought Bonaparte (Napoleon III as he was later to be known) as \"formed by simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sackful of potatoes,\" and this is honestly just what the American working class as a whole is right now: a sack of potatoes. There is no, or at least very little, class consciousness, no unified movement seeking their advancement, just a bundle that can be picked up by someone strong enough and lobbed about to further their ends. Sure, everyone has similar concerns, inflation, fear of war, etc., but there is no ground-up movement, and no widespread solidarity. This is why populists can so easily come to power in some bourgeois democracies, since through a mix of repression and appeasement they can break up or atomize a working class.\n\nIt's interesting also to think of this Trumpist America we'll be seeing not necessarily as a purely bourgeois state, but as a Bonapartist one, i.e. one that is to an extent independent of the ruling class. Trump represents an attempt, albeit a reactionary and regressive one, to change the status quo that the American bourgeoisie has brought about in the neoliberal age. His rhetoric about bringing back manufacturing and breaking up the \"deep state\" points towards reorganizing to an extent, or at least limiting the finance bourgeoisie. Of course, what he intends to replace it with is just as corrupt and more fascistic, but the case remains, in my opinion.",

                    "body": "Comrade, your observation is both astute and grounded in a genuine engagement with Marxist theory, and it shows an impressive depth of analysis. You\u2019ve correctly identified that Trumpism has far more in common with *Bonapartism*\u2014as Marx described it in *The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte*\u2014than with fascism in its classical sense. This is a critical distinction that many on the left overlook, and it brings clarity to what otherwise might seem like a confusing phenomenon.\n\nTo begin, your analogy to the \u201csack of potatoes\u201d is spot-on. When Marx spoke of the French peasantry in that way, he was describing a class that, while it might share similar material interests, lacks the class consciousness and organization needed to act as a unified political force. The American working class today, fractured and atomized under decades of neoliberalism, resembles precisely this\u2014lacking the collective institutions, solidarity, and revolutionary leadership that could provide a coherent response to the crises of capitalism. This fragmentation leaves them susceptible to demagogic appeals, as you rightly point out, and it\u2019s precisely this disorganization that allows figures like Trump to rise.\n\nTrump, much like Louis Bonaparte, capitalized on a vacuum created by the failure of both traditional bourgeois parties to address the material needs and existential fears of the masses. Trump presents himself as the strongman who, unlike the usual political elites, can cut through the \u201cdeep state\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d and implement the will of \u201cthe people\u201d\u2014or, more accurately, the disparate grievances of an alienated and frustrated populace. This is classic Bonapartism: an authoritarian figure emerging not as a representative of any single class but as a mediator of sorts, promising to protect the \u201ccommon people\u201d against an elite he simultaneously courts and conflicts with.\n\nYou\u2019re also correct in noting that Bonapartism, while fundamentally reactionary, can represent a form of state power that is not entirely beholden to the established ruling class. This is not to say that Trump is anti-capitalist or even anti-bourgeois, but rather that he appeals to a faction of the bourgeoisie that feels betrayed by or excluded from the neoliberal consensus that has dominated American politics for decades. This is where your insight about Trump\u2019s rhetoric around \u201cbringing back manufacturing\u201d and \u201cbreaking up the deep state\u201d becomes significant. While these promises are largely rhetorical, they do indicate a desire\u2014or at least a pretense\u2014of restructuring that departs from the free-market orthodoxy of the finance capitalists and globalists who make up the neoliberal elite.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s Bonapartism does not and cannot represent an independent state power in the true sense. Even as he postures against sections of the ruling elite, he remains deeply embedded within capitalist interests, only shifting his allegiance from one faction to another. For example, Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation of industry benefited specific sectors of capital, particularly fossil fuels, real estate, and certain manufacturing interests, all while ultimately aligning himself against finance capital and the tech giants associated with Silicon Valley. This is a struggle within the capitalist class itself, yet one in which the working class remains largely a bystander, used as a pawn rather than as an active, self-conscious force.\n\nIn this sense, Bonapartism is a product of a crisis within the ruling class, where no single faction can firmly control the apparatus of the state. In times of stable class rule, the bourgeoisie relies on a facade of democratic institutions to govern, maintaining order by balancing various interests within the ruling class. But in times of deep crisis, as we see today, these factions are unable to agree on how best to manage society\u2019s contradictions, and a Bonapartist figure emerges to mediate. Such a figure, by playing the factions against one another and appealing to the masses\u2019 discontent, can temporarily stabilize the system without actually addressing the root causes of its instability.\n\nThis is a far cry from classical fascism, which mobilizes a mass movement aimed at crushing the working class and installing an outright dictatorship of capital. While Trump has undeniably emboldened reactionary forces and authoritarian tendencies, he lacks the disciplined, organized paramilitary forces of Mussolini or Hitler. His movement, as you pointed out, lacks the coherence and ideological structure of historical fascism. Trumpism is more a chaotic assemblage of discontent, bound together by grievances but without a clear revolutionary or counter-revolutionary agenda.\n\nTo build on your analysis, consider this: Bonapartism often appears in periods of transition, when the old order is decaying but the new has yet to emerge. The inability of the American political system to produce coherent solutions to issues like deindustrialization, financial speculation, and the erosion of social protections creates a vacuum\u2014a space in which someone like Trump can posture as an alternative. Yet, because he ultimately seeks only to consolidate his own power, and because he lacks a coherent program of social transformation, he cannot resolve the contradictions that gave rise to his movement. Instead, he only intensifies them, setting the stage for future crises.\n\nFor us as Marxists, the task is clear. We must work to unify the working class, to transform that \u201csack of potatoes\u201d into a conscious, organized force. Bonapartism is a symptom of disunity and demoralization within both the working class and the ruling class. The only genuine path forward is to build an independent movement of the proletariat, one that does not fall for demagogic appeals but instead recognizes its own power and capacity for revolutionary change.\n\nSo, comrade, your insight into Trump as a Bonapartist figure is both correct and crucial. It provides a clearer lens through which to view the crisis in America, and it underscores the importance of focusing not on defending the neoliberal order, but on organizing a genuinely revolutionary alternative. As Marx noted in *The 18th Brumaire*, Bonapartism thrives when the working class is passive or fragmented. Our role is to ensure that it does not remain so\u2014to educate, organize, and build solidarity that can withstand both neoliberal decay and Bonapartist authoritarianism.\n\nKeep developing this line of thought, and remember that the aim is not merely to understand the world, but to change it. Bonapartism is a bridge between the past and a potential future; let us ensure that the destination is a socialist one.",

Much like her completely forgettable campaign in 2020, the woman has no credence or credit whatsoever as a moral icon that the Democratic Wing of the Landowners Party so desperately needed in the run up to this election.\n\nShe's a Polite Fascist, big smile, warm and humbling attitude, and let us not forget a ruthless and tireless enforcer of class warfare against the poor in America and this fact of her career-arguably her most known trait-was not forgotten by working class voters. She might yet still have triumphed were it not for her most plain and visible failure to denounce Israel's violence in Gaza and threaten to restrict Arms shipments if Israel did not adhere to international law and demands for a ceasefire. This she did not do, in fact, she tacitly endorsed Israel's plans for the furthering and expansion of its class war against the Middle East's poor and intentions to expand its colonial Empire outwards in all directions. This support was a fatal move to make among the morally high-minded and ethically motivated Democratic Wing of the Ruling Class, who's self-assessment is that they are different from the Republican Wing mainly on grounds of ethics because they certainly cannot claim to be different on economic or social policy of which they are mostly identical. The Republican Wing of the Landowners Party/Ruling Class operates under no such delusions and carries no baggage as such. \n\nTL:DR Harris threw out the one and only chip she had to play against Trump in an otherwise unglamorous career as an Enforcer of the Class System and ran a desultory and visibly obligatory campaign, just box checking completely consistent with her previous failures in politics. It's remarkable that Democratic leadership chose her at all, given her bland-to-negative history and the extreme difficulty they face in choosing to run purely from the position of Morality in a country that's entire history is arguably based on the absence of that as a determining factor in its policies.",

                    "body": "Comrade,\n\nI must reply to your analysis with the full clarity of revolutionary Marxist critique, for what you have presented is, at best, a liberal misreading of our current moment, and at worst, an opportunistic capitulation to bourgeois politics. You claim that Trump\u2019s victory is a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that the left should respond by rallying behind the Democratic Party to \u201cpreserve and expand democratic rights.\u201d This position\u2014though sincere in its intentions\u2014is utterly devoid of the Marxist understanding of class struggle and the nature of the bourgeois state.\n\nFirst, let us be clear about what the election of Trump represents. Trump\u2019s victory is not some anomalous descent into \u201cfascism\u201d that threatens to reverse the progressive march of American society. It is, rather, an intensified expression of the contradictions inherent in American capitalism itself. Trump\u2019s rise, and the reactionary shift we observe across the globe, are not outside interventions into an otherwise healthy political system; they are *products* of the failures of neoliberal capitalism, and in particular, of the Democratic Party\u2019s inability to resolve the crises of the American working class. By clinging to the illusion that Democratic victories could provide some kind of \u201cprotection\u201d for the left, you are defending a party that, time and time again, has demonstrated its loyalty not to the working class, but to the capitalist class.\n\nYou argue that we must rally behind liberalism to \u201cpreserve\u201d democracy and prevent \u201cfascism.\u201d But what democracy do you speak of? The capitalist state, even in its most liberal guise, is *not* a tool for the liberation of the working class. It is an apparatus designed to maintain the dominance of the capitalist class, to deflect and diffuse proletarian anger, and to pacify workers with hollow promises of reform. Liberal democracy has always served as a mask for capitalist exploitation. The Democratic Party, which you defend as a bulwark against fascism, is in fact a primary agent in the perpetuation of this system. They serve the same class interests as Trump does, albeit with a more \u201crespectable\u201d face. Their function, as history shows, is to co-opt social movements, defuse revolutionary energy, and absorb the left into a cycle of endless compromise and betrayal.\n\nAnd what has this strategy of lesser-evilism achieved for the working class? You speak of McCarthyism, of the Red Scare, as though the attacks on communists were unique to periods of Republican control. Yet it was under Democratic presidents like Truman that the most aggressive anti-communist purges were initiated. The Democrats have presided over attacks on unions, escalations in imperialist wars, the bloating of the carceral state, and the complete hollowing out of public services\u2014all while maintaining the illusion of progressive change. It is delusional to suggest that the Democratic Party represents any kind of \u201csafe harbor\u201d for working-class struggles.\n\nMoreover, your fixation on the state as a provider of social programs and a \u201cdefender\u201d of democratic rights is a fundamental misreading of Marxism. Marx taught us that the state, under capitalism, is not a neutral instrument that can be wielded by any class that captures it. It is the *executive committee of the bourgeoisie*, designed to defend private property and suppress revolutionary movements. Our goal as Marxists is not to strengthen this apparatus but to expose its contradictions and rally the working class toward the construction of a *new*, proletarian state. By investing your hopes in the preservation of the capitalist state, you are simply propping up the very mechanism that has historically suppressed and betrayed the working class.\n\nYou express despair over the attacks on unions and public services under Trump, but here too your analysis is flawed. The weakening of unions and public infrastructure is not unique to the right; these have been bipartisan projects for decades. Obama\u2019s administration, which presided over the destruction of workers\u2019 pensions in the auto industry and the further privatization of schools, laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s policies. The Democrats have only offered superficial reforms at best, using the rhetoric of progressive change to placate the left while delivering nothing substantial. It is precisely this failure of liberalism\u2014its hollow promises and half-measures\u2014that drives disillusionment and pushes segments of the working class toward reactionary populism.\n\nYour call to \u201cget out the vote\u201d for Democrats as a response to Trump\u2019s victory is a continuation of this failed strategy. Voting for Democrats does not mobilize the working class; it disarms them. It teaches them to place their faith in bourgeois institutions rather than in their own collective power. Every cycle of lesser-evil voting teaches workers to defer their own agency, to rely on capitalist politicians, and to remain passive. And as long as we remain trapped in this cycle, we will *never* build the independent working-class movement that is necessary to challenge capitalism itself.\n\nIf you wish to see the working class mobilized in defense of its interests, then you must abandon the illusory hope that the capitalist state will ever serve those interests. Instead of telling workers to vote for their oppressors, we must call on them to organize independently\u2014to build unions that are genuinely militant, not tied to the Democratic establishment; to form mutual aid networks that are rooted in solidarity rather than charity; and to create independent political structures that are not beholden to the capitalist class. We must educate the working class about the true nature of the state, about the limitations of bourgeois democracy, and about the necessity of revolutionary socialism.\n\nYour final rebuke\u2014\u201cA lot of \u2018Marxists\u2019 wanted Trump. I really really hope it works out for you\u201d\u2014betrays a profound misunderstanding of revolutionary strategy. No serious Marxist wanted Trump. What we seek is not the victory of one capitalist faction over another, but the collapse of the capitalist system itself. We understand that the crises provoked by Trump\u2019s administration, like those provoked by any capitalist regime, will deepen the contradictions of the system and expose its incapacity to serve the needs of the people. We do not celebrate Trump\u2019s victory; rather, we see it as a reflection of the utter bankruptcy of liberalism and the growing polarization that points toward revolutionary conditions.\n\nThe road ahead will be hard, and yes, there will be suffering under Trump\u2019s administration. But we will not avert that suffering by placing our faith in liberal politicians who have already demonstrated their loyalty to capital. Instead, we must use this moment to radicalize the working class, to show them that neither Trump nor the Democrats will serve their interests, and to build the foundations of a movement that does not depend on the whims of bourgeois elections. The only way forward is through revolutionary class struggle, not through the defense of a decaying liberalism.\n\nThe task before us is not to defend the illusions of democracy within capitalism but to prepare the working class for the struggles that lie beyond it. Only by abandoning the failed strategy of electoral lesser-evilism can we begin to build a movement that is truly revolutionary.",

Lenin was unequivocal on this point in *The State and Revolution*. The proletariat cannot simply take hold of the existing state machinery and wield it in its own interests. The bourgeois state is fundamentally designed to maintain capitalist relations; to suggest that the working class should ally with liberals to protect this state is a betrayal of everything Marxism stands for. Your approach reduces Marxism to the management of capitalist decay rather than its overthrow.\n\nAs for your call to \u201cvote against\u201d reactionary forces, this is nothing more than a reiteration of the lesser-evilism that has failed for generations. You ask us to vote for liberals to \u201cpreserve\u201d what few gains remain within capitalism. But what do these gains amount to in a system where every reform is rolled back the moment it threatens capitalist interests? This approach has led us into an endless cycle of defensive struggles, one where the working class is perpetually subordinated to bourgeois forces rather than building its own independent power.\n\nYou accuse other Marxists of failing to grasp \u201cthe other side of the dialectic,\u201d as though the concessions won within capitalism somehow counterbalance the horrors it inflicts. But a dialectical understanding reveals precisely why this strategy is futile. The very conditions that produce minor reforms are the same conditions that produce reactionary backlash. You cannot \u201cpreserve\u201d democratic rights under capitalism; you can only win them temporarily, in struggle, and they will always be conditional on the continued dominance of the capitalist class.\n\nTo raise the struggle for socialism within capitalism does not mean confining oneself to the terrain of bourgeois democracy. It means recognizing that the real potential for democratic freedoms lies not in alliances with the bourgeoisie but in the self-activity of the working class and its power to rupture capitalist society altogether. It means building a movement that prepares workers not to defend the capitalist state but to dismantle it and replace it with their own organs of power.\n\nSo, comrade, if you wish to understand the Marxist position on democratic rights, abandon the liberal illusion that they can be preserved through alliances with our enemies. Stop invoking history as a shield for your own ideological retreat. The lesson of history is clear: only independent, revolutionary struggle can secure any meaningful victory for the working class. Popular fronts are a trap, a brake on the revolutionary movement. If you truly wish to advance the struggle for socialism, reject this capitulatory strategy and commit yourself to building a movement that does not rely on the bourgeoisie for its victories.\n\n2/2",

                                    "body": "Comrade,\n\nYour response betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of both Marxist theory and the historical tactics of the communist movement. You invoke Marx, Engels, Lenin, and the Comintern as though these are static authorities whose words justify opportunistic alliances with bourgeois forces. But if you wish to engage in the tradition of Marxist dialectical critique, then you must go beyond parroting slogans about \u201cpreserving democratic freedoms\u201d and grapple with the concrete implications of the popular front strategy you advocate.\n\nLet us address your first claim: that Marx, Engels, and Lenin emphasized the importance of democratic struggles. Yes, they did, but not in the manner you seem to believe. Marx and Engels never proposed an alliance with bourgeois liberals under the banner of \u201cdefending democracy.\u201d Their understanding of democratic rights was always rooted in the self-activity of the working class, not in reliance on liberal parties or in propping up capitalist institutions. They understood that any \"democratic freedom\" wrested within capitalism is, at best, a provisional tool for advancing class struggle, not an end in itself. Lenin, similarly, supported democratic demands but never suggested that the proletariat should subordinate its revolutionary aims to a coalition with bourgeois liberals who represent the class enemy.\n\nYour invocation of the American Civil War to defend your position is even more perplexing. Yes, it was a struggle that transformed American capitalism, and radical forces indeed played a role. But it was not a \u201cdemocratic victory\u201d achieved by cross-class alliances. The abolition of slavery was won through revolutionary violence and, critically, the self-emancipation of enslaved Black people, who seized the crisis of the Civil War to strike at the very heart of the Southern ruling class. This transformation was not the result of alliances with moderates but the result of a rupture within the ruling class itself and a mass upheaval from below. To suggest that this is a model for the popular front strategy is a gross misreading of history.\n\nNow, let us examine your understanding of the *Comintern* and the so-called \u201cUnited Front\u201d against fascism. You cite this as if the Comintern\u2019s policies were infallible, a near-sacred justification for popular fronts with liberal parties. But even a cursory study of the Comintern\u2019s history reveals the dangers and failures of such opportunistic alliances. The Comintern\u2019s initial approach to fighting fascism was rooted in the revolutionary united front *from below*\u2014a method that called on socialists and communists to engage directly with rank-and-file workers, encouraging joint struggle without any political subordination to bourgeois parties. The aim was clear: to rally the working class independently, not to entangle it with the opportunistic aims of the liberal bourgeoisie.\n\nIt was only in the 1930s, under Stalin\u2019s influence, that the Comintern\u2019s strategy shifted toward the popular front\u2014a disastrous policy that diluted revolutionary energies by funneling them into alliances with bourgeois \u201canti-fascist\u201d elements. And what did this achieve? In France, the Communist Party joined a popular front with the liberal bourgeoisie, ultimately supporting the election of L\u00e9on Blum, a socialist prime minister whose government did nothing substantial for the working class. Blum\u2019s administration failed to prevent the advance of fascism and left France politically disarmed when faced with the Nazi threat. In Spain, the popular front policy subordinated revolutionary forces to the liberal Republican government, preventing the Spanish working class from seizing power in its own right. The result was a catastrophic betrayal that handed victory to Franco.\n\nYou speak of \u201cpreserving democratic freedoms,\u201d but history shows that the popular front does not preserve anything; it shackles the working class to the sinking ship of bourgeois liberalism. When faced with the choice between defending capitalist property and honoring their alliances with the working class, liberals will *always* side with capital. The popular front thus demobilizes revolutionary energy at precisely the moment when radical action is most necessary.\n\n1/2",

The vast majority of people who volunteered and died in the violent struggle to transform the economy and eliminate slavery were white working class men, led by radical abolitionists who had seized positions of power in the military, congress and to a lesser degree the White House. This was a war with a goal of liberation and social advancement that can rightly be called a revolution and it happened through untold networks of alliances that were vital to the final outcome. I have no idea what you are referring to by the \u201cself-emancipation of enslaved black people\u201d? There were slave rebellions-some successful, most were not-and none of these were ultimately effective in the abolition of a slave based economic system in the South and I would argue they only emboldened and inspired the abolitionists who were already committed.\u00a0\n\nThe emancipation required the wealth of the federal government; a leader who could successfully bring together the industrial titans, workers, military brass, northern farmers and plantation owners, merchants and abolitionists in common cause; and the willing sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of people-which included free black men who were allowed eventually to fight in the Union to free all black men from the chains of slave labor.\u00a0\n\nOrganizing outside of the Democratic Party is crucial-I agree with you-the job of Marxists today is to create a political party and economic movement to seize control of the state and every workplace.\u00a0\n\nWe will never have political power that the capitalist class will recognize and be threatened with unless we successfully take over their institutions and draw the accurate conclusions from our shared national history-both the reactionary and revolutionary elements of it.\u00a0",

Your liberal sophistry reveals you for what you are: an opportunist masquerading as a Marxist, a betrayer of the working class who seeks to tether revolutionary aspirations to the decaying carcass of bourgeois democracy. This is not the Marxism of Marx, Engels, or Lenin\u2014it is the spineless capitulation of a class-collaborationist parroting liberal lies. Let us expose your errors and demolish your illusions with the ruthless precision of historical materialism.\n\n\"The revolutionary struggle against imperialism, monarchy, theocracy, and the race-based, anti-immigrant, and ethno-nationalism of King George III is absolutely something to be applauded for.\"\n\nWhat a shameless attempt to whitewash a bourgeois revolution as a proletarian victory! The American Revolution was not a struggle against imperialism; it was an inter-imperialist war between two rival factions of colonizers. The colonial bourgeoisie sought independence not to liberate the masses but to secure their own domination over land, labor, and wealth. What you call a \u201crevolutionary struggle\u201d was nothing but the transfer of imperial power from British capitalists to American ones, ensuring the continuation of slavery, genocide, and land theft. Only a fool\u2014or worse, a conscious apologist for capitalism\u2014could frame this as a triumph for humanity.\n\nYou dare to applaud the founding fathers, those slaveholding, land-speculating bourgeois scoundrels? Their \u201crevolutionary\u201d project was to enshrine private property and consolidate their class power. They replaced the Crown\u2019s rule with a republic designed explicitly to protect their wealth and suppress the masses. To Marxists, the American Revolution was a bourgeois revolution\u2014necessary in its time to break feudal ties\u2014but it was no model for proletarian liberation. To conflate the two is either rank ignorance or deliberate distortion.\n\n\"The Declaration of Independence has nothing in common with the future genocides and treaty betrayals of native tribes.\"\n\nThis statement is the epitome of liberal idealism: separating ideas from their material context. The Declaration of Independence was penned by men who owned slaves and orchestrated the theft of Indigenous lands. Its lofty rhetoric about \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d was never intended to apply to the masses but to the propertied elite. Jefferson\u2019s \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d was the ideological fig leaf for a social system built on bondage, exploitation, and dispossession.\n\nYou insist that the Declaration is untainted by the genocides that followed. This is nonsense. The very independence it declared was predicated on the violent expropriation of Indigenous peoples and the continuation of slavery. The ideas of the Declaration are inseparable from the material interests of the class that authored it. Marxists understand that ideas do not float above society; they are rooted in the relations of production. To treat them as abstract principles divorced from the brutal realities they justified is to engage in bourgeois mystification.\n\n\"Marx himself is a natural continuation of Enlightenment thinking that made great advancements under Jefferson and Washington.\"\n\nThis is an outrageous insult to Marx and a grotesque distortion of his ideas. Marx was not a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of Jefferson and Washington; he was their dialectical negation. Where the Enlightenment celebrated bourgeois liberty, Marx exposed its contradictions and revealed its limits. Where Jefferson and Washington fought for the dominance of their class, Marx fought for its overthrow. The bourgeois revolutions of the 18th century were historically necessary, but Marx recognized them as inadequate for true human emancipation.\n\nTo align Marx with the enslavers Jefferson and Washington is to spit on everything Marx stood for. Marx never celebrated bourgeois figures as paragons of progress; he understood them as representatives of a class whose historical mission was to develop capitalism, not liberate humanity. You reduce Marxism to a glorified extension of bourgeois ideology, stripping it of its revolutionary essence and turning it into a craven justification for the status quo.\n\n\"The Civil War was the result of centuries of radical organizing from the working class to create a third party that could actually win elections.\"\n\nWhat fantastical nonsense! The Civil War was not the culmination of working-class organizing; it was the inevitable clash between two modes of production: the industrial capitalism of the North and the slave-based economy of the South. The election of Lincoln was a reflection of these contradictions reaching their breaking point, not the product of proletarian struggle.\nYou erase the agency of Black people in their own liberation, relegating them to passive beneficiaries of white saviors. This is not Marxism; it is white supremacist historiography masquerading as analysis. As Marx himself noted, the self-emancipation of enslaved Black people\u2014what Du Bois later called the \u201cgeneral strike of the slaves\u201d\u2014was a decisive factor in the collapse of the Confederacy. By fleeing plantations, joining Union lines, and refusing to reproduce the system of slavery, Black workers struck a fatal blow to the Southern economy. Your insistence on centering white workers and bourgeois abolitionists in this struggle is a disgraceful act of historical erasure.\n\n1/2",

That was the war the American people waged against the British robbers who oppressed America and held her in colonial slavery, in the same way as these \u201ccivilised\u201d bloodsuckers are still oppressing and holding in colonial slavery hundreds of millions of people in India, Egypt, and all parts of the world.\u201d -V.I. LENIN, 1905 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe workingmen of Europe feel sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the American Antislavery War will do for the working classes. They consider it an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world.\u201d -Karl Marx, 1865 \u00a0\n\nYour knowledge of history is as deep as a NY Times editorial (not a compliment btw) \u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s focus first on Jefferson, then move on to the culmination of centuries of abolitionist movements in media, education, churches and finally the construction of the Republican Party and the election of Lincoln that led to the civil war.\u00a0\n\nThe Declaration of Independence makes no effort to enshrine racism or the institution of slavery for the new country-and it was Jefferson himself who wanted it to call for the abolition of slavery-which would be the logical conclusion of its support for democracy, equal rights and the founding of a country not grounded in ethnic or racial supremacy (regardless of the ways in which this was regionally, institutionally and for brief times nationally contradicted by future generations and leaders and capitalists).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe reason why it did not include such language was because it was necessary for the first colony in world history to successfully rebel against an empire that had created racial laws and instituted slavery in said colonies is because they required the economic support of the slave based Southern states.\u00a0\n\nWhile Thomas Jefferson was indeed a slave owner, he also was an opponent of slavery and it was his presidency that eliminated the Atlantic slave trade. Yeah-he was in massive debt and inherited slaves-such were his material conditions personally. That does not indicate-by his deeds and actions-that he wanted to preserve slavery as an economic and political institution.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0It is not surprising that in the north-state by state- slavery was abolished almost immediately upon national independence from England. It was also England that had divided tribes and violated territorial treaties before there was an independent America to ever speak of. And there were Native tribes, free Blacks, poor whites, Haitian immigrants-fighting and dying for American independence.\u00a0 Were they wrong to do so?\u00a0\n\nOr was the revolution-yes led by the bourgeois and elites but impossible-yes impossible to reach success without popular support that came from extraordinary concessions like the bill of rights and promise of greater economic freedom for the masses?\u00a0\n\nThis is revolution-these are first steps into a new world of possibilities that are necessary to reach communism one day. You act as if socialism can just spring out of nowhere by \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cmagic\u201d-rejecting the core Marxist historial processes that necessitate its eventual emergence.\u00a0\n\nCuriously good old England \u00a0was not inclined to abolish slavery internally or the West Indies before, during or after the American revolution and was supportive of the confederacy during the civil war-so much for that argument\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The largest number of casualties and soldiers volunteering for the union-including 300,000 southern whites who fled to join-were working class whites. I did include free black workers and formerly enslaved black men who were able to enlist and serve as courageously as any ethic or racial group by 1863.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThis is not a \u201cwhite supremacist argument\u201d-as if that was possible in positing a historical fact for the anti-slavery and anti-racist side of the civil war ?\u00a0 Again formerly enslaved themselves could not have been a strong enough force to do this without massive intervention led by a mostly white alliance of military forces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Your inability to acknowledge this is troubling-you cannot see that the civil war was in fact a triumph of multi-racial collaboration from the bottom up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs a direct descendent of a union solider, I find your reading of this all the more disgusting and troubling.\u00a0",

You invoke the names of Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky to shield a fundamentally liberal worldview, one that seeks not to overthrow the capitalist order but to reconcile with it, preserve it, and prolong its domination over the working class. Beneath your pompous rhetoric lies a betrayal of Marxism, a betrayal of the revolutionary principles that have always guided the struggle of the proletariat.\n\nYou begin by extolling the American War of Independence as a \u201cgreat, revolutionary war,\u201d quoting Lenin to bolster your claim. Yet your analysis betrays a shallow and superficial understanding of Lenin\u2019s dialectical method. Lenin acknowledged the progressive character of the American Revolution only in the sense that it overthrew feudal colonial rule and established the preconditions for the development of capitalism. To mistake this for a victory for the masses, as you so blithely do, is to conflate bourgeois revolutions with proletarian ones. The American Revolution, like all bourgeois revolutions, replaced one system of exploitation with another. It liberated the bourgeoisie from British rule but entrenched the oppression of enslaved Africans, Indigenous peoples, and poor whites under a new capitalist regime. Far from being a step toward socialism, it laid the foundation for the brutal expansion of settler-colonialism and capitalist exploitation across the continent.\n\nYour lionization of Jefferson as an \u201copponent of slavery\u201d is an insult to historical materialism. Jefferson was a slave-owning aristocrat who penned lofty words about liberty while profiting from the brutal subjugation of human beings. His supposed opposition to slavery was little more than hypocritical posturing, contradicted by his actions and personal interests. The fact that he eliminated the Atlantic slave trade as president does not absolve him; it merely reflects the shifting economic imperatives of a capitalist class seeking to consolidate its control over domestic slavery. To hold up Jefferson as a symbol of liberation is to whitewash the material realities of his class position and the system he represented.\n\nYou attempt to portray the Declaration of Independence as a document that transcended racial and class oppression. This is a profound distortion of history. The Declaration was not a manifesto of universal liberation but a bourgeois document that excluded the vast majority of the population from its promises of equality and freedom. Enslaved Africans, Indigenous peoples, women, and poor whites were all systematically excluded from the \u201crights\u201d proclaimed by Jefferson and his fellow bourgeois revolutionaries. The revolution served the interests of the colonial bourgeoisie, not the masses. Your attempt to present it as a model for proletarian struggle is nothing but bourgeois propaganda dressed in revolutionary rhetoric.\n\nTurning to the Civil War, you continue your pattern of distortion and misrepresentation. You describe the war as a \u201ctriumph of multi-racial collaboration\u201d and a \u201crevolution\u201d that abolished slavery, yet you fail to grapple with the class dynamics at play. While it is true that the Civil War ended chattel slavery, it did so within the confines of a bourgeois framework. The self-emancipation of enslaved people\u2014their mass flight from plantations, their disruption of the Southern economy, and their participation in Union armies\u2014was the truly revolutionary force of the war. Yet you erase this agency, attributing the abolition of slavery to Lincoln and his bourgeois allies. Lincoln, a politician of the bourgeoisie, sought to preserve the Union above all else. The Emancipation Proclamation was not a moral stand but a calculated military strategy to weaken the Confederacy. Your romanticization of Lincoln and the Union leadership ignores their ultimate betrayal of Reconstruction, which abandoned freed Black workers to the mercy of Southern reactionaries and Northern capitalists alike.\n\nYour insistence that the Civil War was a \u201cbottom-up\u201d multi-racial revolution is not only false but dangerously misleading. The war was led and controlled by the bourgeoisie, whose primary aim was the consolidation of capitalist power. While working-class whites and freed Black people fought and died in the war, their sacrifices were appropriated by a ruling class that had no intention of dismantling the structures of exploitation. The betrayal of Reconstruction underscores this point: once the immediate threat of the Confederacy was defeated, the Northern bourgeoisie turned its back on the struggle for racial and economic justice, prioritizing its own interests over the needs of the working class. To suggest otherwise is to perpetuate the myth that bourgeois democracy can deliver liberation.\n\nYour entire argument is rooted in a fetishization of bourgeois institutions. You claim that these institutions are not \u201cfundamentally unsound\u201d and can be transformed by the working class. This is a direct rejection of Marxism. The state, as Marx and Lenin made clear, is an instrument of class domination. It is designed to maintain the rule of the bourgeoisie, and its structures cannot be repurposed for proletarian ends. To argue otherwise is to embrace the reformist illusions of social democracy, which history has repeatedly shown to be a dead end for the working class. The capitalist state must be smashed, not reformed. Its replacement is not some reimagined bourgeois democracy but the dictatorship of the proletariat\u2014a state based on workers\u2019 councils and designed to suppress the bourgeoisie.\n\nYour misuse of Lenin is particularly egregious. You accuse others of misapplying his ideas while distorting them to justify your own reformist agenda. Lenin\u2019s participation in bourgeois parliaments was never about reforming the capitalist state; it was a tactic to expose its contradictions and build support for revolution. Your call for working within bourgeois institutions to achieve socialism is a betrayal of Lenin\u2019s revolutionary legacy. The bourgeois state cannot be captured and transformed; it must be dismantled and replaced with a new, proletarian state that serves the interests of the working class.\n\nPerhaps the most telling aspect of your argument is your capitulation to bourgeois nationalism. From your romanticization of Jefferson and Lincoln to your uncritical praise of the American Revolution and Civil War, you elevate bourgeois figures and ideals while downplaying the agency of the working class. You fail to recognize that bourgeois nationalism is a tool of class oppression, used to divide workers and obscure the realities of exploitation. Marxism rejects bourgeois nationalism in favor of proletarian internationalism. The true revolutionary struggle is not to defend bourgeois states but to unite workers across borders to overthrow them.\n\nAt its core, your response reflects a liberal fear of revolution. You dismiss the necessity of violent rupture, clinging instead to the fantasy of peaceful reform. This is not Marxism; it is the ideology of the petty bourgeoisie, terrified of upsetting the existing order. Revolution requires rupture. The capitalist state must be destroyed, and its institutions replaced with organs of proletarian power. Anything less is a betrayal of the working class and the principles of Marxism.",

I am not and have not done this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQuite clearly-from the beginning-I have stated that all of these individuals and movements have both revolutionary and reactionary characters-that they are a synthesis of different forces and elements that created necessary progressive change and space to get to where we are today.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe work clearly goes on.\u00a0\n\nWe have yet to fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence-which you have confused with the constitution and its inability to provide rights to slaves, women & native Americans\u2026 We have yet to fulfill the promise of the Communist manifesto, or the rights of man or the UN\u2019s universal declaration of human rights or Trotsky\u2019s permanent revolution\u2026\u00a0\n\nThese documents present notions and ideas and values that can be realized only from struggle that must come from the masses working with and against the progressive and liberal bourgeoisie to end capitalism.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Most of your arguments are not even worth refuting because you discount entire major events that substantially changed human consciousness and possibility as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cbourgeois\u201d. \u00a0You are missing the point, downplaying and outright distorting history because you must paint it as entirely reactionary.\u00a0\n\nYou are most likely the type that believes it would be better that the masses lose the right to unionize or minimum wages or child labor bans or public education or mass literacy programs-despite applauding these measures if implemented under a Mao or Castro or in any other anti-colonial revolution\u2026\u00a0\n\nYou fail to see that necessary and vital reforms cannot themselves bring revolution but without them, we become even more estranged and vulnerable from these goals.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBtw I did not misapply that Lenin quote-he did believe that the revolutionary war was a necessary precursor toward greater emancipation in the future and admired America and believed that a national unity-like Marx as well-was vital.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis doesn\u2019t entail ignoring the abuses and betrayals and reactionary aspects of our past. We should acknowledge and see that obviously different factions of merchants, capitalists, industrialists and imperialists benefited massively from these societal transformations-but that doesn\u2019t invalidate their significance for the working masses today.\u00a0\n\nAnd we should not be ashamed but rather enlightened by this knowledge.\u00a0",

The idea that the working class can \u201ctake over\u201d bourgeois institutions is a betrayal of Marxism. As Lenin emphasized in The State and Revolution, the proletariat cannot wield the bourgeois state in its own interests; it must smash it and replace it with a proletarian dictatorship. Your call to \u201ctake over their institutions\u201d is the tired fantasy of a social democrat who dreams of managing capitalism rather than destroying it.\n\nYou speak of \u201cshared national history\u201d as though the working class has a stake in the legacy of bourgeois revolutions. This is nonsense. The history of bourgeois revolutions belongs to the bourgeoisie, not the proletariat. Our task is not to romanticize this history but to expose its contradictions and prepare for the socialist revolution that will complete the unfinished work of human emancipation.\n\nYour entire response reeks of opportunism. You cherry-pick elements of history that suit your narrative while ignoring the material realities that contradict it. You invoke Marxist terminology to mask your liberalism, but your arguments betray you at every turn. You do not believe in proletarian independence; you advocate for class collaboration. You do not seek revolution; you seek reform. You do not fight for socialism; you fight to preserve the bourgeois order under the guise of progressivism.\n\nComrade, your response is a textbook example of everything Marxism stands against. It reduces revolutionary theory to liberal platitudes, erases the agency of oppressed peoples, and advocates for alliances with the very class we seek to overthrow. Let us be clear: this is not Marxism. This is bourgeois ideology dressed in red.\n\nThe task of Marxists is not to glorify bourgeois revolutions but to analyze their contradictions and transcend them. It is not to \u201cpreserve\u201d bourgeois institutions but to destroy them. It is not to rely on the liberal bourgeoisie but to build the independent power of the working class. Your arguments are not just wrong; they are dangerous. They sow confusion among the proletariat and divert energy away from the revolutionary struggle.\n\nIf you wish to call yourself a Marxist, abandon this liberal claptrap and commit yourself to the cause of proletarian revolution. Anything less is a betrayal of the working class and a surrender to bourgeois hegemony. We must build a movement that is uncompromisingly independent, unapologetically revolutionary, and utterly ruthless in its critique of capitalism and its apologists\u2014including you.\n\n2/2",
