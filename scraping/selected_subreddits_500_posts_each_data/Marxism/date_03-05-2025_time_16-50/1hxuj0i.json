    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been diving into Lenin recently, and after reading just 10 pages, it took me 4 hours and 30 minutes. I found myself compelled to stop and write out a detailed synthesis of my understanding, stopping four times in total. I had to fully connect his ideas about the state, going all the way back to the real start of class systems around 3000 BCE with the rise of early state societies in Mesopotamia, and their transition to feudalism around 500 CE, then through the transition to capitalism after the 1400s, to see what he meant by the state being oppressive. I was initially misguided, thinking that a far-left ideology meant a powerful state regulating capitalism, so I felt the need to map out the entire historical process just to make sure I understood Lenin\u2019s point properly.\n\nThis process of deeply engaging with the material, questioning my understanding, and justifying Lenin\u2019s arguments before continuing felt like it was necessary to make sure the material wasn\u2019t just slipping away. I even feared that what I was reading could be useless or irrelevant. The failure of the USSR kept coming to mind, and I had to reconcile that with the notion that Lenin\u2019s work is still valuable, especially in the first 10 pages I\u2019d read, even if the historical application didn\u2019t align perfectly.\n\nThis method of pausing, synthesizing, and reflecting seems to be the way my brain works, but it\u2019s also incredibly time-consuming and feels almost compulsive. I can\u2019t move forward without deeply internalizing the material. I know it sounds like a good thing to be able to heavily absorb material, because it should help me read and internalize Marxist theory, but it also is annoying to rely on it to enjoy the reading and it seems to fade away when I move on to a new field of books, such as how I'm currently on Marxism and am losing touch with Plato. \n\nIs this kind of intense analysis common among others studying Marxism? Is it a strength I should embrace, or am I overthinking things and slowing myself down unnecessarily? I\u2019d appreciate any advice on how to strike a balance between deep reflection and making progress.",

Even so, it seems like it would still be bad practice to write more about what I read since I'd end up reading less? I've already wrote 3 pages on the 10 pages I've written, would this be a form of overanalyzing I should decrease before adding the reading journal too?",

            "body": "If, for example, you start learning Spanish, and set out to read *Don Quixote* in the original, the first ten pages will\u2014and should\u2014take you four and a half hours. And that\u2019s made up for because by the time you\u2019re reading your tenth book in Spanish, you\u2019ll be breezing through. It\u2019s just a sign of good, disciplined studying. And inevitably, if you keep down the path you\u2019re on, it\u2019ll become much easier\u2014you\u2019ll just write \u201cthis is a state capture theory\u201d; \u201cthis reminds me of Kant\u2019s in-itself\u201d; he\u2019s paraphrasing Marx here\u201d; \u201cthis event contradicts this\u201d; etc., etc., and that\u2019ll be enough for you. But for now, you\u2019re learning, and it sounds like you\u2019re doing it the right way.\n\nOn the whole, don\u2019t sweat the details though. Most professional academics only have encyclopedic knowledge of one or two subjects, and typically from a narrow perspective. If you keep doing things as you\u2019re doing them, the important stuff will stay with you.",
