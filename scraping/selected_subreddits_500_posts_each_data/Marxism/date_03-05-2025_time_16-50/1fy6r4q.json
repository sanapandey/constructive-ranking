    "selftext": "\u201cSecondly: in order that everyone in society can enjoy prosperity, everybody must work. Only somebody who performs some useful work for the public at large, whether by hand or brain, can be entitled to receive from society the means for satisfying his needs. A life of leisure like most of the rich exploiters currently lead will come to an end. A general requirement to work for all who are able to do so, from which small children, the aged and sick are exempted, is a matter of course in a socialist economy. The public at large must provide forthwith for those unable to work \u2013 not like now with paltry alms but with generous provision, socialised child-raising, enjoyable care for the elderly, public health care for the sick, etc.\n\nThirdly, in accordance with same outlook, i.e. for the general well-being, one must sensibly manage and be economic with both the means of production and labour. The squandering that currently takes place wherever one goes must stop. Luxury industries which make all kinds of frippery for the idle rich must also be abolished , along with personal servants. All the human labour tied up here will be found a more worthy and useful occupation.\n\nIf we establish in this way a nation of workers, where everybody works for everyone, for the public good and benefit, then work itself must be organised quite differently. Nowadays work in industry, in agriculture and in the office is mostly a torment and a burden for the proletarians. One only goes to work because one has to, because one would not otherwise get the means to live. In a socialist society, where everyone works together for their own well being, the health of the workforce and its enthusiasm for work must be given the greatest consideration at work.\u201d\n\n-Rosa Luxemburg, \u201cThe Socialization of Society\u201d",

It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.*\" (1970)",

The reason people with free time aren\u2019t vilified is because their free time inherently means more affordable goods. With the labour voucher system, the goods they produce are measured in time based value rather than abstract value. \n\nMeaning, the less labour time something takes to produce, the cheaper it is. The cheaper it is, the more of it is available.\n\nWhat I\u2019m describing is a system by which the incentive structure literally becomes communal. To see others doing well is to know that you, as a member of society, are doing well. Sharing within the prosperity of society. Enjoying more and more access to the means of consumption as a natural byproduct of the mode of production rather than some kind of charity.\n\nThis is opposed to capitalism where seeing other people doing well generally means you are doing worse because in the game of abstract value, some people need to lose in order for others to win.",

Additionally, Marx proved in Value, Price, and Profit, that in cases of economic boom, the total percentage of total wealth that workers take home decreases rather than increases, even if their wage becomes higher.\n\nWhether this is morally acceptable to you is a matter of your own personal feelings. What is undebatable is that it causes various economic problems such as class struggle, economic recessions, inflation, etc. Unions have historically been the main way this class struggle is waged for workers to gain a higher percent of the gross revenue of their firms, though they have been very severely curtailed in power in the US and other parts of the world.",
