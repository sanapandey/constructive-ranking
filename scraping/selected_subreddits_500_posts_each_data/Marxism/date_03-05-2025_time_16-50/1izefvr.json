Is it when socialist system is established? And, when no private property is possible, neither is the existence of the capitalist class, so there is no contradiction anymore.\n\nOr, does it happen after socialism, when we get to communism and there are no classes to contradict each other, but the contradiction may still occur in socialist system?\n\nSo this is the question, when the thing changes, are its contradictions resolved, or can they stick around for a few changes and only then resolve?",

            "body": "You are approaching the \"unity of opposites\" through a very, very common misconception of dialectics among Marxists. The point is **not** that two opposing forces (proletariat and capitalist) will in future reconcile into a larger unity. On the contrary, the dialectical insight is that *what appears to be two opposing forces are, in fact, already the same thing**. In other words, when the capitalist encounters the revolutionary proletariat, he encounters nothing but the truth of capitalism itself, the expression of its internal limit. That is, the proletariat is nothing but the underside of capitalism, wholly internal to it and its logic.\n\n\nThis is why a dialectical analysis should always consist in showing how two apparently external opposing poles are, in fact, one pole against itself, against its own internal limit or failure.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, to answer your question, the unity of opposites has already happened. The point is that the proletariat *is* the truth of capitalism. The point is not to reconcile or synthesise the opposition, but to active it this contradiction or internal limit and go through to the end with it.\u00a0",

I'm not sure where this distortion comes from, but it's probably related to how Hegel's dialectics has been mischaracterised to mean \"thesis > antithesis > synthesis\" which is something Hegel never wrote about and completely goes against his system.\n\n\nThe misuse is especially strange when we consider Marx's famous quip that \"the limit to capital is capital itself\". That is, the obstacle to capitalism is not some external object or force which it must reconcile with or overcome, but rather the obstacle is nothing other than itself. This is a perfect example of the unity of opposites (probably better translated as \"a coincidence of opposites\"), where the object and its opposition are revealed to be the same thing. So how Marxists end up misusing the phrase is a bit confusing.\n\n\nThe dialectal insight is precisely that every system, society, identity, etc. is cut through by its own contradiction with itself and thereby frustrated from within.\u00a0",

You can use the deeper insight to inform your opinions and actions. Marxists, in particular, use this method to critically analyze world social, economic, and political events to inform their political perspectives and tactics on intervening in the class struggle.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not going to be able to describe the fundamental features of the dialectical method to you in a reddit comment, but I\u2019ll attempt to make a sketch. You can analyze anything with this method. Just take the development of a tree for example. It starts out as a seed, then develops into a seedling, then sapling, then a young tree, a mature tree, and eventually it dies. A tree is not a seed, and conversely, a seed is not a tree, \u00a0but the process that develops one into the other is consistent throughout. To bring this back to the previous comment, the tree is shaped by the tree and vice versa. The tree and seed are opposite forms of the same thing that are united through the contradiction existing between the sprouting and death of the tree - the contradiction existing in the development of the tree\u2019s life process. If you take the example even further, that tree then produces its own seed, many of them in fact, eventually dies, and from the seeds begotten by the tree during its life, the cycle begins all over again.\u00a0\n\nThere is a whole lot of nuance to the process that I\u2019m intentionally leaving out because this comment is getting too long, but if you\u2019re curious about the fundamentals of this method this is a good place to start:\u00a0https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/12/abc.htm",

            "body": "There is an important point in Hegel's writings about historical change, but probably also logical progression, where basically the contradiction can lead to what is referred to as an upheaval \\[aufhebung\\]. The result of this upheaval is not to be taken as something isolated, or something that has made what was previously obsolete, but something new that has arisen out of the specific context of all previous upheavals and interplays of different contradictions. Hegel likens this, I believe in the introduction to the Phenomenology of Spirit, to a tree that grows a fruit. You wouldn't say that the flower has disproven the bud, or that the fruit has disproven the flower. All of the parts of the progression of bud to fruit are necessary, and also, fittingly, *come back onto themselves* in the form of a seed.\n\nLenin warns against drawing conclusions about events that are too far removed from the conditions that currently prevail. [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/misc/x02.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/misc/x02.htm)\n\nTo my knowledge Marx does not exactly specify how the contradiction will resolve, and what exact system will arrive in the future through the revolution. I don't think this is without intention, as I believe he realized that such speculation is fruitless. What was and is at hand is for the working class to become not just a class in itself, but for itself, that is in its own eyes. Not just class consciousness but class-self-consciousness. \n\nKnowledge comes only through praxis. There is a direct line of praxis in armed struggle through the Paris commune, the russian revolution and the chinese revolution as well as the great proletarian cultural revolution in china. If you want to know more about what actually ends up happening in the most disciplined attempts at establishing socialism I think this is where to look. \n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/)\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)\n\nUnfortunately there is no extensive work by Mao himself on the great proletarian cultural revolution, which would've been invaluable. His fears came true.

This is because making such conclusions is historical idealism, that history is made and directed by great minds with grand ideas. History is made by the masses.",

            "body": "I don't know the answer directly, but working on dialectics myself. So a few thoughts. \n\n>To illustrate with an example, a contradiction between capitalist and working class, when does it resolve?\n\nIt begins to resolve when the material conditions that produce those classes are abolished, but probably needs to be fully resolved by cultural revolution under socialism, because people who grew up under class conflict conditions will have those imprinted on them, whereas newer generations shouldn't. \n\nBut to be honest, I suspect, it'll only really resolve itself once the entirety of capitalism across the globe is abolished, otherwise you simply transpose class conflict to Socialist states vs. capitalist ones as happened during the Cold War.\n\n>Or, does it happen after socialism, when we get to communism and there are no classes to contradict each other, but the contradiction may still occur in socialist system?\n\nI think personally contemporary Marxists are better focusing entirely on Socialism. Communism isn't really possible to predict until we Socialize the material conditions of contemporary capitalism and re-examine our historical situation from the new perspective of the the full global dictatorship of the proletariat at a minimum. \n\nThere will indeed be contradictions, even under Communism, it's just they won't be materially produced by the economic base, therefore Communism is the real beginning of human history without exploitation as a material basis. The contradictions will very likely be in the superstructure of culture and politics and I personally also think in difference between humans such as height, weight, beauty, race, gender, sexuality which are materially determined too. \n\n>So this is the question, when the thing changes, are its contradictions resolved, or can they stick around for a few changes and only then resolve?\n\nIt depends who you ask. \n\nI have finally decided that a qualified Hegelian Marxism is the correct method of dialectics. Therefore, within dialectical AND historical materialism, it is true that a process of aufheben occurs in the resolution of contradictions.\n\nThe key is to avoid determinism. \n\nThere was nothing determined about going through the industrial revolution and capitalism as we did. Ancient Rome wasn't a stage on the path to capitalism, however the previous material basis of society does have a determining relation to what comes after it, and often aspects of it survive in the next stage of economic development. \n\nThat's why Marx explained it was only with capitalism that the mechanisms underpinning the previous era's really became transparent. Because we learned from capitalism the previous stages flow and development that ultimately burst forth the capitalist forces. But this was not a pre-determined path by any means, it was the movement of history and Man that involved a certain degree of openness. \n\nSo to begin to answer your question, when does the unity of opposites occur? Whenever the contradictions holding the unity together is negated and a negation of the negation (often something new) resolved/abolishes the contradictions and raises the movement of society/Man to a higher form. \n\nThe previous capitalist material and social relations have to be transformed and incorporated into socialism in non-antagonistic forms in order for the movement to occur as per the aufheben.\n\nIt's complicated lol, and I'm not even sure I've quite rightly explained it. Luckily Marxism is a process of uncovering the real movement of history, so it's an ongoing project of learning (theory) and implementation (practice), so as long as we are working in the right direction, try never get too hung up on anything as fixed law.\n\nHope that helped a little bit even.",

I thought history was a series of economic stages, PC > Slavery > Feudalism > Capitalism > Socialism, and although ther law of uneven development meant societies could jump, they still needed to go through each stage. \n\nIt also meant I thought people's enviroment and capitalist social relations had a larger degree of determinism than each persons internal development, which actually is what together, forms the dialectical movement of history. \n\n>Does any change resolve all contradictions (which are related to that change, socialist society may not resolve the contradictions unrealated to economy and/or politics)? Or, dually, can change/transformation happen only when contradictions related to it are resolved, or can they linger for some time after?\n\nMy understanding would be no. Because you have to account for the quantity into quality aspect, and I'd add to this Althusser's concept (Mao too) over overdetermination of contradictions. \n\nSo contradictions are a multiplicity of forces within a given totality, and during particular conjunctures fuse into revolutionary or revolutionary potential crisis, that are then overcome and propel society forward or are too early and the dominant and reactionary forces reassert themselves again for another time. \n\nSo when we move to Socialism, it is principly the economic contradiction that is moving that forward, but other conflicts like say, the student revolt of France 68 could be about resolving sexual/gender/student contradictions, and not transpose into a full overthrow of the system, though with the proper forces on the Left, they could have potentially. \n\nSo each set of contradictions has a principle driving force in a given situation, capitalism is usually when its in bust mode, but cultural contradictions happen too without capitalism being in crisis and without necessarily threatening capitalism itself if it can re-integrate the new relations of production within the capitalist forces of production unchallenged. \n\nSo feminism for example can change the gender of the exploiters (somewhat) without necessarily disrupting the flow of capitalism, or perhaps simply nudging it a bit, but still not fundamentally replacing it. \n\n> Or, dually, can change/transformation happen only when contradictions related to it are resolved, or can they linger for some time after?\n\nI'd think they linger, but I do like Mao's point about the 'two roads' under socialism, forwards or backwards if not vigilant about the spectre of capitalist relations of production superimposing themselves on the productive forces of a socialist country and thereby sending it backwards. That's what I'm thinking anyway in relation to what you are asking.\n\n>This would imply that this transformation is simultaneous with the resolution of contradictions and that they cannot linger. Would that be the right way to interpret your thoughts?\n\nI don't think so. \n\nMy thinking would be sort of.\n\n1. A unity of opposites is what creates the continual production of two tendencies that need to resolve i.e. capitalist class vs. working class. So this is a systemic contradiction that needs to be resolved. \n\n2. Eventually a quantity of contradictions accumulates, so a situation becomes overdetermined and revolutionary, so quantity into quality. \n\n3. The negation of the negation is what generates something 'new' that resolves the principle contradiction. This can be a transformation within one of the two opposing forces, OR, (and I'm sure Lenin said this but I can't find it again) something entirely new and outside the original contradiction. \n\n4. When the contradiction is resolved, aufheben occurs and yes the old contradictions linger to some degree in the higher new form, however they are no longer principle contradictions but rather are incorporated to some degree into the new situation. So I'm thinking capitalist produced materials would inform and be the basis of socialism's leap, but they would be distributed, or produced in new non-antagonist material circumstances and so would cease to be active but would still sort of be there for a time. \n\nMy field of study is art and culture I should say, so the economics of this is sketchy, I'm sort of working within and against certain ideas of Stalin, Mao, Zhadanov, Althusser, Lenin, Trotsky etc and thinking of how culture can be used to form a contradiction to help aid the collapse of capitalism by transforming people's ideas about the relations of production, and then after that, what to actually do with capitalist produced art, do we need proletarian art (no btw lol) etc, etc. So thats what's informing my own research/answer just so you know. \n\nAgain, I have no idea if I even answered your question, but I tried lol.",

                                            "body": ">In my understanding, overdetermination as used by Hegel and, later, Marx, \n\nIt's from Lacanian psychology and then used by Louis Althusser, so it's not from Marxism directly but brought into it by Althusser as a placeholder word/concept for his theory of causality (I think).\n\n>For example, in a series of social issues: capitalism, ecology, sexism, racism, etc., there is a singular issue among them which structures and changes all others: namely, the capitalism. That is, capitalism is the social issue which overdetermines all other issues. If is the particular which changes all other particulars.\n\nThat's actually it's total opposite, and what overdetermination is designed to counter. \n\nMy understanding is that it comes from psychoanalysis (Lacan) and is when a diverse set of psychosis fuse into the singular symptom, but are no of a singular symptomatic cause. \n\nSo within Marxism, it's used to exactly counter what you said. What you said is singular economic determinism, where every contradiction is reduced to a singular cause ... economic contradiction. Overdetermination is when a diverse set of contradictions across the base and superstructure fuse into a revolutionary situation in the constellation of a time specific conjuncture. Therefore many sources of contradiction cause a single revolution. \n\nWhy this is important is because Althusser (at least in the period he uses overdetermination) is radically anti-Hegelian, and what he is trying to counter is the idea of economic determinism, or a singular cause of social change. This is because a single cause of all contradiction, for him, is a akin to Hegelian movement of development by spirit or geist, and he thinks attributing a single cause to the movement of history based on economic determinism, is like saying history has a purpose/logic that it MUST follow, and everything is almost pre-determined to follow its rythm and purpose and therefore the diversity of economic, political and social contradictions and causes is falsely ignored/reduced to simple single contradiction, when infact there are many. \n\nFrom Contradiction and Overdetermination:\n\n>Indeed, a Hegelian contradiction is never really overdetermined, even though it frequently has all the appearances of being so... Hegel, therefore, argues that every .consciousness has a suppressed-conserved (aufgehoben) past even in its present, and a world (the world whose consciousness it could be, but which is marginal in the Phenomenology, its presence virtual and latent), and that therefore it also has as its past the worlds of its superseded essences. But these past images of consciousness and these latent worlds (corresponding to the images) never affect present consciousness as effective determinations different from itself: these images and worlds concern it only as echoes (memories, phantoms of its historicity) of what it has become. that is, as anticipations of or allusions to itself. Because the past is never more than the internal essence (in-itself) of the future it encloses this presence of the past is the presence to consciousness of consciousness itself, and no true external determination. A circle of circles, consciousness has only one centre, which solely determines it; it would need circles with another centre than itself \u2013 decentred circles \u2013 for it to be affected at its centre by their effectivity, in short for its essence to be over-determined by them. But this is not the case. \n\n>We have only to ask why Hegel thought the phenomena of historical mutation in terms of this simple concept of contradiction, to pose what is precisely the essential question. The simplicity of the Hegelian contradiction is made possible only by the simplicity of the internal principle that constitutes the essence of any historical period. If it is possible, in principle, to reduce the totality, the infinite diversity, of a historically given society (Greece, Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and so on) to a simple internal principle, this very simplicity can be reflected in the contradiction to which it thereby acquires a right. Must we be even plainer? This reduction itself (Hegel derived the idea from Montesquieu), the reduction of all the elements that make up the concrete life of a historical epoch (economic, social, political and legal institutions, customs, ethics, art, religion, philosophy, and even historical events: wars, battles, defeats, and so on) to one principle of internal unity, is itself only possible on the absolute condition of taking the whole concrete life of a people for the externalisation-alienation (Entausserung-Entfremdung) of an internal spiritual principle, which can never definitely be anything but the most abstract form of that epoch\u2019s consciousness of itself: its religious or philosophical consciousness, that is, its own ideology. I think we can now see how the \u2018mystical shell\u2019 affects and contaminates the \u2018kernel\u2019 \u2013 for the simplicity of Hegelian contradiction is never more than a reflection of the simplicity of this internal principle of a people, that is, not its material reality but its most abstract ideology.\n\nSo Hegel reduces the movement of history, even when it is presented in a seemingly complex manner, upon one central moving contradiction. In contrast the Marxian dialectic is totally different. \n\n>Here, then are the two ends of the chain: the economy is determinant, but in the last instance, Engels is prepared to say, in the long run, the run of History. But History \u2018asserts itself\u2019 through the multiform world of the superstructures. from local tradition to international circumstance. Leaving aside the theoretical solution Engels proposes for the problem of the relation between determination in the last instance \u2013 the economic \u2013 and those determinations imposed by the superstructures \u2013 national traditions and international events \u2013 it is sufficient to retain from him what should be called the accumulation of effective determinations (deriving from the superstructures and from special national and international circumstances) on the determination in the last instance by the economic. It seems to me that this clarifies the expression overdetermined contradiction, which I have put forward, this specifically because the existence of overdetermination is no longer a fact pure and simple, for in its essentials we have related it to its bases, even if our exposition has so far been merely gestural. This overdetermination is inevitable and thinkable as soon as the real existence of the forms of the superstructure and of the national and international conjuncture has been recognised \u2013 an existence largely specific and autonomous, and therefore irreducible to a pure phenomenon. We must carry this through to its conclusion and say that this overdetermination does not just refer to apparently unique and aberrant historical situations (Germany, for example), but is universal; the economic dialectic is never active in the pure state; in History, these instances, the superstructures, etc. \u2013 are never seen to step respectfully aside when their work is done or, when the Time comes, as his pure phenomena, to scatter before His Majesty the Economy as he strides along the royal road of the Dialectic. From the first moment to the last, the lonely hour of the \u2018last instance\u2019 never comes. \n\nSo one single contradiction 'the majesty of the economy' doesn't simply scatter the rest at a moment of singular contradiction and determinism. \n\nIn the same essay Althusser lays out the diverse series of contradictions in Russia that all came together to form the singular moment of the Russian revolution, but not these are all seperate contradictions. But for space reasons I can't link it. However it's here, https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1962/overdetermination.htm\n\nIt begins, but then continues with examples of the multiplicity of contradictions:\n>But here we should pay careful attention: if it is obvious that the theory of the weakest link guided Lenin in his theory of the revolutionary party (it was to be faultlessly united in consciousness and organisation to avoid adverse exposure and to destroy the enemy), it was also the inspiration for his reflections on the revolution itself. How was this revolution possible in Russia, why was it victorious there? \n\nWhat Althusser does is he says a conjuncture can be overdetermined by a multiplicity of contradictions ... however, people forget and overlook, he also says a situation can be *underdetermined* and that means there really aren't enough contradictions active in a conjuncture to spur revolution. This his the cause of the ebb and flow of revolution from high points to low points in history according to his theory of causality within a newly mapped conception of totality, as he tries to break with the schematic and deterministic base and superstructure model which he thinks (along with Hegelian influence) led to the Stalinist deviation and economic determinism.",

            "body": "Heinrich on the topic of dialectics:\n\n\n\"Whenever Marx's theory is spoken of, eventually the catchword dialectics (or: dialectical development, dialectical method, dialectical portrayal) pops up, and in most cases, there is no explanation of what exactly is meant by this word. Most notably in Marxist political parties, opponents in an argument frequently accuse each other of having an \"undialectical conception\" of whatever matter is being debated. Also today, in Marxist circles people speak of something standing in a \"dialectical relationship\" to another thing, which is supposed to clarify everything. And some-times, whenever one makes a critical inquiry, one is answered with the know-it-all admonishment that one has to \"see things dialectically.\" In this situation, one shouldn't allow oneself to be intimidated, but should rather constantly annoy the know-it-all by asking what exactly is under-stood by the term \"dialectics\" and what the \"dialectical view\" looks like. More often than not, the grandiose rhetoric about dialectics is reducible to the simple fact that everything is dependent upon everything else and\u00a0is in a state of interaction and that it's all rather complicated-which is true in most cases, but doesn't really say anything.\n\n\nIf dialectics is spoken of in a less superficial sense, then one can make a rough distinction between two ways of using this term. In one sense, dia-lectics is considered to be, according to Engel's text Anti-D\u00fchring, \"the science of the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society and thought\" (MECW, 25:131). According to this conception, dia-lectical development does not proceed uniformly and in a linear manner, but is rather a \"movement in contradictions.\" Of particular importance for this movement are the \"change of quantity into quality\" and the \"negation of the negation.\" Whereas Engels was clear that with such general state-ments nothing is understood about individual processes, this was any-thing but clear within the framework of worldview Marxism; \"dialectics,\" understood as the general science of development, was often viewed as a sort of Rosetta Stone with which everything could be explained.\n\n\nThe second way in which dialectics is spoken of relates to the form of depiction in the critique of political economy. Marx speaks on vari-ous occasions of his \"dialectical method,\" and in doing so also praises Hegel's achievements. Dialectics played a central role in Hegel's philoso-phy. However, Marx alleges that Hegel \"mystified\" dialectics, and that his dialectic is therefore not the same as Hegel's. This method gains impor-tance with the \"dialectical presentation\" of categories. This means that in the course of the presentation the individual categories are unfolded from one another: they are not simply presented in succession or alongside each other. Rather, their interrelationship (how one category necessitates the ex-istence of another) is made clear. The structure of the depiction is therefore not a didactic question for Marx, but has a decisive substantive meaning.\n\n\nHowever, this dialectical portrayal is in no way the result of the \"application of a ready-made \"dialectical method\" to the content of politi-cal economy. Ferdinand Lassalle intended such an \"application,\" which caused Marx to express the following in a letter to Engels: \"He will dis-cover to his cost that it is one thing for a critique to take a science to the point at which it admits of a dialectical presentation, and quite another to apply an abstract, ready-made system of logic to vague presentiments of just such a system\" (MECW, 40:261).\"\n\n\nMichael Heinrich - AN INTRODUCTION to the THREE VOLUMES of KARL MARX'S CAPITAL\n\n\nthe whole book is a must read. the most read introduction to marx in germany. you can order it for cheap or even find a free .pdf online :)",

In evolution it is about inheritance of traits, in dialectics it is about dissolution of an antinomy in a new frame of reference. \n\nThis is where the thesis - antithesis - synthesis conception comes from. Two competing claims exclude one another, but result from the same frame of reference (e.g. the set of all sets that do not contain themselves). Via the dialectical progression they are embedded into a frame of reference, where they lose their exclusiveness (the class of all sets...).\n\nHaving a child was actually a metaphor for dialectics by Hegel and I still think it is pretty.

For Hegel, (precisely because he was a most consistent and unhypocritical idealist, who thereby disclosed the secret of every other, inconsistent and incomplete idealism) \u2018being\u2019, i.e. the world of nature and history existing outside thought and independently of it, was inevitably transformed into a mere pretext for demonstrating the logical art, into an inexhaustible reservoir of \u2018examples\u2019 confirming over and over again the same schemas and categories of logic. As the young Marx remarked, \u2018the matter of logic\u2019 (die Sache der Logik) fenced the \u2018logic of the matter\u2019 (die Logik der Sache) off from Hegel, and therefore both the Prussian monarch and the louse on the monarch\u2019s head could equally well serve the idealist dialectician as \u2018examples\u2019 illustrating the category \u2018real individuality in and for itself\u2019.\n\n>With such an approach both a boiling tea-kettle and the Great French Revolution were only \u2018examples\u2019 illustrating the relation of the categories of quality and quantity; but any empirical reality impinging on the eye, however fortuitous it might be in itself, was thereby converted into an external embodiment of absolute reason, into one of the necessary dialectical stages of its self-differentiation.\nThe profound flaws in the Hegelian dialectic were directly linked with idealism, due to which the dialectic was readily transformed into ingenious, logically subtle apologies for everything that existed. It is therefore necessary to look into all these circumstances more closely.",

I criticized the mystificatory side of the Hegelian dialectic nearly thirty years ago, at a time when it was still the fashion. But just when I was working at the first volume of Capital, the ill-humored, arrogant and mediocre epigones who now talk large in educated German circles began to take pleasure in treating Hegel in the same way as the good Moses Mendelssohn treated Spinoza in Lessing's time, namely as a 'dead dog'.- I therefore openly avowed myself the pupil of that mighty thinker, and even, here and there in the chapter on the theory of value, coquetted with the mode of expression peculiar to him. \n\n>The mystification which the dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general forms of motion in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be inverted, in order to discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.\n\n>In its mystified form, the dialectic became the fashion in Germany, because it seemed to transfigure and glorify what exists. In its rational form it is a scandal and an abomination to\nthe bourgeoisie and its doctrinaire spokesmen, because it includes in its positive understanding of what exists a simultaneous recognition of its negation, its inevitable destruction; because it regards every historically developed form as being in a fluid state, in motion, and therefore grasps its transient aspect as well; and because it does not let itself be impressed by anything, being in its very essence critical and revolutionary.\n\n>The fact that the movement of capitalist society is full of contradictions impresses itself most strikingly on the practical bourgeois in the changes of the periodic cycle through which\nmodern industry passes, the summit of which is the general crisis. That crisis is once again approaching, although as yet it is only in its preliminary stages, and by the universality of its field of action and the intensity of its impact it will drum dialectics even into the heads of the upstarts in charge of the new Holy Prussian-German Empire.\n\nThe kind of language you used in your Hegel quotes is exactly the problem, like 'substantiality of spirit' etc. Lenin even has a quote in his notebooks or reviewing Hegel that he is going through it and taking out, substituting or ignoring all the spirit nonesense to attempt a materialist dialectical understanding of what's useful in Hegel and what isn't. \n\n>\"The child is the concrete existence of this unity [between the parents]; the love of the parents for their child is not only a sensuous but an ethical relation.

This is upside down as any materialist knows. \n\nThink of Engels example of the abstract concept of 'Fruit' in your style of Hegelian schema: https://www.marxists.org/subject/dialectics/marx-engels/holy-family.htm\n\nDialectics isn't in the Being of a thing as it's movement, dialectics is the scientific methodology of how you appropriate and represent the real underlying movement and inter-relations that determine any Being or Object in its real material conditions of existence. \n\nYou can't say X is an example of dialectics, you can only say X is understood dialectically. It's a subtle difference but a key one that many people slip into (myself included from time to time). \n\nMy other quote from Illyenko above relates to this:\n\n>Irrespective of his intentions, Hegel showed, with exceptional clarity, that idealism led thinking up a blind alley and doomed even dialectically enlightened thought to hopeless circling within itself, to an endless procedure of \u2018self-expression\u2019 and \u2018self-consciousness\u2019. For Hegel, (precisely because he was a most consistent and unhypocritical idealist, who thereby disclosed the secret of every other, inconsistent and incomplete idealism) \u2018being\u2019, i.e. the world of nature and history existing outside thought and independently of it, was inevitably transformed into a mere pretext for demonstrating the logical art, into an inexhaustible reservoir of \u2018examples\u2019 confirming over and over again the same schemas and categories of logic. As the young Marx remarked, \u2018the matter of logic\u2019 (die Sache der Logik) fenced the \u2018logic of the matter\u2019 (die Logik der Sache) off from Hegel, and therefore both the Prussian monarch and the louse on the monarch\u2019s head could equally well serve the idealist dialectician as \u2018examples\u2019 illustrating the category \u2018real individuality in and for itself\u2019.\n\nAs for Lenin:\n\n> see that Lenin has his own specific form or understanding of \"dialectics\", which has very little to do with either Hegel or Marx. Core of many of Lenin's misunderstandings is an imprecise understanding of materialism. For Marx the material are social interactions and their dynamics, Lenin misinterprets this to something significantly more Machian. \n\nYou aren't wrong, Lenin's dialectics is heavily influenced by (but not determined by) Plekhanov, who was too Hegelian in his understanding of the break of Marx from Hegel and so accidently imposed on the Russian school too much Hegelianism within their conception of dialectics that culminated in the lifeless Stalinist short course on the subject. \n\nLenin however is important because he *was* a nimble dialectical thinker, who used it in his literary style against opponents to massive impact in his political work of making the revolution. He didn't have time, like Marx, to write out dialectics theory, but his notebooks give hints and his actions and political work are practical examples of how he used dialectics to understand the constellation of forces in front of him and overthrow them. He is proof of how dialectical reasoning (theory) can be properly used to inform, and guide political activity (practice) is the basis of scientific socialism. \n\nThe outcome unfortunately petrified under Stalin, but arguably that's because Stalin wasn't a dialectical thinker, and was incapable of understanding the processes he was working on as ably as Lenin could have.\n\nIMO. \n\n>Whether there is a dynamic in social interactions upon the advent of children is a silly question. Apparently is this a social dynamic and thus in a Marxist sense a materialist phenomenon. The family dynamic is without reasonable doubt as materialist as Hegel gets. Marx and Engels interpret it only differently to Hegel. Hegel sees the family as a moral institution, Marx and Engels as a historic phenomenon. But apparently the inner dynamic of a family is a dialectical materialist phenomenon par excellence\n\nThat immediately sounds better than what you wrote before though. \n\n>When you have a child with your wife, the contradictions between the two of you is resolved within the child. \n\nThat doesn't actually make sense does it? Gender contradictions, racial contradictions, religious contradictions, class contradictions ... sure two people from those contradistinctive determinations can have a child ... but how does having one resolve anything within it? \n\nWhat movement materially do you think is happening in the process you are trying to articulate dialectics with? Remembering of course that dialectics isn't that process of having a child, but the process of having a child that you are trying to represent materialist dialectically. \n\n>\u201cThe first class opposition that appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the first class oppression with that of the female sex by the male. The family contains in embryo not only slavery (servitus), but also serfdom, since it contains already within itself the opposition between exploiter and exploited.\u201d (The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, 1884)\n\nDoesn't that mean that materially, the family unit is one of the first affected by temporal changes in the division of labour in society, and therefore in need of abolition in it's current form of domestic servitude of women by men with the Rights of ownership?\n\nShowing how material circumstances literally determine how Men and Women relate to one and other, and in this instance taking on an exploititive and unequal form?\n\nYou can understand such a movement dialectically, but it isn't of itself dialectical, it's a response to the relations of production of a given society at a given point in time. No?",

Now, apparently an essential part of this book is Giardano Bruno\u2019s concept of the interpenatration of opposites, coincidence of contraries, or whatever else it is commonly termed. I looked at the definitions, and they sort of make sense but I couldn\u2019t really find relevant examples. The closest I could find was something like \u201cwhen you\u2019re running in a circle, the further away you get from the start, the closer you get to the start\u201d, or, \u201cthe closer you get to the night, the closer you get to the morning, because the day is cyclical\u201d. That seems like more of a paradox brought about by our language; but I\u2019m pretty simple minded with these things. I then discovered that Marx invokes this, so I looked for an answer there. I ended up reading a long article which totally failed to provide a clear definition or example. It must mean something to some people, but I really haven\u2019t a clue what they\u2019re talking about or how it\u2019s relevant to anything.",

You can apply it to literally anything. Sure you can get more complicated and learn the particulars but in the same way ppl intuitively grasp the rules of formal logic, ppl intuitively grasp the laws of dialectics, which Marx saw as building on formal logic and allowing one to think more complexly.",

It's sort of like the next phase of philosophy because materially we have reached a new era of scientific know how so we need a corresponding philosophy of knowledge. \n\nSo we are ending the old religious way of thinking, which Hegel took to it's absolute limit, are rationalizing it by putting it on a materialist footing, so essentially combining the best of Idealism vs. Materialism, to reach a higher form of understanding. \n\nSo Hegel basically tried to scientifically raise philosophical thinking to reach a new clarity, but because he was an Idealist could only get so far ... he was like the very best the old philosophy could achieve.\n\nMarx, after Feuerbach had done a materialist interpretation of Hegel, overcame the deficiencies of both and practically produced the philosophy that now best corresponds to our current material conditions. \n\n>I get skeptical when that can\u2019t be done. When things concerning human affairs start sounding like theories found in physics or maths, I am suspicious. \n\nOut of curiousity, how should they sound? \n\n\n>I really have no idea what you mean when you say Marx wrote dialectically.\n\nHe presented his theories on History in a writing style that assumes you can read the information from a dialectical point of view. How he presents the information stylistically assumes a philosophy of reading that is dialectical. \n\n>\u201cThe world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things,\u201d wrote Engels, \u201cbut as a complex of processes, in which things apparently stable, no less than their mind-images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away.\u201d\n\nFirst rule of dialectics, the thing you study is a process of development. This sounds sorta obvious maybe? But most people assume the thing they study is fixed and given enough time they can learn it fully. But it constantly changes, and actually depending on how approach it's study, that too can change it. \n\nFor example, approach the study of society from a ruling ideology and it seems natural, static, the way things just are. \"Don't you know, people are greedy naturally, so capitalism simply builds on this natural tendency\". That's not true, the material conditions contribute to and enlarges the creation of greed within humans for example. \n\n>Suppose, for example, we are thinking about men, about \u201chuman nature.\u201d Then we should think about human nature in such a way that we recognize that men live in society and that their human nature cannot be independent of their living in society but develops and changes with the development of society. We shall then form ideas about human nature which correspond to the actual conditions of men\u2019s existence and to their change and development. But yet people often think about \u201chuman nature\u201d in a very different way, as though there were such a thing as \u201chuman nature\u201d which manifested itself quite independent of the actual conditions of human existence and which was always and everywhere exactly the same. To think in such a way is obviously to make a false, misleading abstraction. And it is just such an abstract way of thinking that we call \u201cmetaphysics.\u201d\n\nThis flows sorta nicely from my talking point of the first principle, into second. The thing you are studying is both a process of development, and it also doesn't exist in isolation, and so to cut it off from the inter-relations of other processes of development which determine it is to misrepresent it. \n\nSo, generally speaking, dialectics is the study and presentation of the processes that condition the movement/development of, in Marxist terms History, and understanding the inter-relation of phenomena upon one and other to give a true presentation of the movement of human history. Once you gain that knowledge instead of history being sorta random (albeit with processes underpinning it), humans can consciously direct history to better goals rather than be swept along. \n\nThere are then laws for this study developed by Engels, but this is where it starts getting theory heavy. \n\nDialectics, long story short, is philosophy that corresponds to modern scientific knowledge of things. If humans are to truly deepen their understanding of things they have to replace God for example as the foundation of the development of things, and understand the material processes in their actuality, and so correspondingly they need a new presentation for such a knowledge, because old thinking was based on Philosophical Idealism.",

That\u2019s trivial and anybody who denies that can be laughed out of the room.\n\nThat's nonesense. People make statements all the time that don't follow this logic. \n\nThey attribute for example, qualities to marginalized groups like immigrants or minorities of criminal behaviour and laziness,  ignoring the social processes that condition that behaviour. \n\nPoor people are poor because they are faulty inside and so deserve it, rich people are rich because they are winners inside and so deserve it, is basically most peoples thinking as evidenced by voting patterns as one example. \n\nSo modern thinking definitely does not follow through on what you think. Or is Trump for example not deporting Mexican immigrants from America and attributing to them internal qualities that are negative, but which are either total fabrications, or go against the actual data of the processes of immigration, economic forces and law and order?\n\nIf you start saying x group is y and ignore the material processes that both make them what they are to a degree, and outright obfuscate the true nature of the processes ... whilst you might say 'it's obvious enviroment has an effect on human nature', but the follow through in terms of knowledge and policy isn't there. \n\n>With regards to what knowledge about human affairs, and what that knowledge should sound like, here I\u2019m just lifting everything from Chomsky, so if you want a better explanation go to him, but this is how I understand it. \n\nFair enough. \n\n>Anything we know about human affairs can be stated quite clearly.

With regards to your definition of dialectics at the end. I have no idea what that means.\n\nA few quick things. \n\nWhy would Humanities not want people to understand their work?\n\nLet's keep it simple. Marx contributed massively to the science of History, the science requires a method. Dialectical materialism is that method. There is more to it, but there you go. Simple. You didn't want the complicated stuff. That's your basic 101.  \n\nYou say anything we know about human affairs can be stated quite clearly. \n\nOk, well, tell me something about human affairs simple and clearly? \n\n> But then when you ask them to explain what it all actually means and where we can use it, it turns out to be truisms.\n\nWhat are some of the truisms? Because as I said, your idea about enviroment being a massive contributor in human behaviour being so obvious, is actually often ignored in contemporary political debates as an example. And it gets worse if you ask everyday people via opinion polls, they really don't follow through with that logic. \n\n>With regards to your definition of dialectics at the end. I have no idea what that means.\n\nThat's ok? You have to learn dialectics. If you don't learn it, how would you really know it? \n\nThis discussion could be most useful for you if you ask yourself, what is *your* philosophy? You don't spontaneously arrive at knowledge of anything. You learn it. Dialectics is a method of understanding things ... which you need to learn, because it often isn't taught. \n\nBut ignoring dialectics entirely. What is your philosophy of knowledge of things?\n\nI was just trying to help answer some questions. It was fun for me to do so. If it isn't for you, or you suspect what I'm doing is an institutional trick of the humanities, that's ok.

Marxists obviously don't think it's wrong (duh) and it has been used in the past by people like Lenin to enact real things upon history (Russian Revolution) so it has practical affects, wrong or not. \n\nMy point is, I'm open and honest what the theories are that inform my world view ... Marxist ones. That's actually a broad spectrum, there are various types of Marxists. \n\nThose are just one set of theories amongst a number of others, and I know this. \n\nIf Marxism doesn't work for you, it's not because you are stupid, but because it doesn't seem right to you, so I ask again, what other theories would?\n\nLike, would you read Postmodernist theory? Would you deep dive into some Freudian theory? Do you think Feminism and getting to the root of gender problems would better work with you? You've said before you  appreciate some Ancient Greek philosophy, so maybe you want to go back to the classics to inform your world view. \n\nIt's more you have options, don't force a theory that doesn't work for you. For example, I don't take Postmodernism seriously as a body of theory, hence why I use Marxist theory to inform my viewpoint instead. \n\nI don't like Freud, but I do like Jung, etc, etc. \n\nMarx in your opinion (which is valid) could be wrong, or not useful anymore, so find that philosophy that really gets your juices flowing and makes you feel like you better understand whatever it is that interests you, like history, economics, art, etc etc.",

With regards to ideologies and theories, I\u2019m skeptical of anything that\u2019s attached to a name. For example, I\u2019m reading Plato\u2019s Republic at the moment. There\u2019s some good stuff in there, some abhorrent stuff, this and that. I will surely use some of the ideas, even if only comparitively. I\u2019m certainly not a Platonist. Now I prefer Aristotle, but I\u2019m not an Aristotelian; I just think those are dangerous identifications to make with oneself. Same with Freud, Jung, Hume, the whole lot. I\u2019ll take whatever ideas they were right about, or even just the ones that grow my imagination and make me think, and I like to give them credit when I use them. What I don\u2019t like is when people say \u201cI\u2019m a Marxist\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m a Freudian\u201d and what they mean is that whenever they are asked a question, they cannot think about it themselves; they have to imagine what the master would have thought. I despise that; but I think it\u2019s common sense to despise that. \n\nWith regards to broader ideologies. They mean different things to different people. For example, I would consider myself a feminist, but I stop at the point where pole dancing is supposed to be empowering; just as an example. The only one there that I would reject wholly is Post-Modernism; I just think that is utter nonsense. It seems to me like a string of trivialities puffed up by Parisian cafe regulars so they can dissociate from reality. I think that there is such a thing as truth, and that morality is real and a part of us. Post-Modernism seems to me to be the essence of degeneration.",

But what are alternatives might be a better way to think of it?\n\nOk, so Marxism doesn't seem to be informing you in a way you feel is impactful, what theory does?\n\n>When I talk to somebody who has studied Hume, or Aristotle, they will always show me something that I simply had never thought of; they are totally capable of deepening my conceptions. I\u2019ve never had that with a Marxist. I\u2019ve read Vico, who I just mentioned.

People want more freedom, and their rulers want to give as little as possible, this struggle is essential to the conception of history, he says. Vico was born in 1668. \n\nOk, ok, let's try and just follow through with this quickly and simply. \n\n>People want freedom? \n\n>Their rulers won't give it to them?\n\nWhy would that make sense? You started mid-way through an analysis of a situation. \n\nWhat people want freedom? What people want to deny it to them? Why?\n\nDoesn't those kind of questions depend on the material conditions in which those people are situated in? Would the overthrow of the Roman Republic vs. say the overthrow of the French Monarchy in 1789 (cusp of French revolution I think) have the same demands and processes making them happen? Or would they not depend on the specific conditions of each time?\n\nAlso, where does this desire for freedom come from? Where does this desire to oppress people come from? Marxism gives a more defined and indepth analysis as to why History happens the way it does. \n\nMarxism is at it's core, the science of history. Nothing more. Why it goes into 'socialism/communism' political stuff is because, once you have exposed how history flows, don't you then knowingly want to intervene and direct history? \n\nIf you *know* a system is in place that makes people oppress others, and makes people crave freedom, doesn't *that* then make you want to change the system?\n\nMarx discusses Capitalism so much, because that is the current place we are in within history and understanding it will help us realize it is temporary (instead of exalting it as the best thing ever and a forever system), understand our past of how we got here, and finally direct ourselves to a better future. \n\n>That\u2019s my contention. Words like dialectic and the materialist conception of history and interpenetration of opposites all seem to me, when boiled down, to be common sense notions, derived from material already present in previous literature.\n\nDialectics goes back to Ancient Greece, but then Hegel updated it bigtime, then Marx transformed it further, so yes philosophical discussions do usually keep going backwards if you follow the path they treat on, like Marx back to Hegel back to Kant .... all the way back to Ancient Greece lol.",

Funnily enough Vico was actually the first one to try and make history a science. His book is called \u2018The New Science\u2019.",

I'll look him up myself.\n\nThe first question that immediately jumps to mind is, is why didn't people use him and not Marx in the period roughly 1850-1990 to try and change the world? Because alot of people used Marx as you know. \n\nSo I'm curious what he has to say vs. what Marx says. Thanks for someone new to explore.",
