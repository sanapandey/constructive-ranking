    "selftext": "Hey folks, I wanted to get some feedback about a recurrent phrasing in Marx's writing. To start off - I'm a market socialist, I support a market economy based on worker cooperatives. Marx has said good things about cooperatives and bad things about cooperatives.\n\n**Good things**: \n\n\"The co-operative factories of the labourers themselves represent within the old form the first sprouts of the new, although they naturally reproduce, and must reproduce, everywhere in their actual organisation all the shortcomings of the prevailing system. But the antithesis between capital and labour is overcome within them, if at first only by way of making the associated labourers into their own capitalist,\u00a0*i.e.*, by enabling them to use the means of production for the employment of their own labour.\" - Capital Vol 3 Ch 27\n\n\"The value of these great social experiments cannot be overrated. By deed, instead of by argument, they have shown that production on a large scale, and in accord with the behests of modern science, may be carried on without the existence of a class of masters employing a class of hands.\" - Inaugural Address of the IWMA 1864\n\n**Bad things**:\n\n\"However, excellent in principle and however useful in practice, co-operative labor, if kept within the narrow circle of the casual efforts of private workmen, will never be able to arrest the growth in geometrical progression of monopoly, to free the masses, nor even to perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries. It is perhaps for this very reason that plausible noblemen, philanthropic middle-class spouters, and even keep political economists have all at once turned nauseously complimentary to the very co-operative labor system they had vainly tried to nip in the bud by deriding it as the utopia of the dreamer, or stigmatizing it as the sacrilege of the socialist.\" - IWMA 1864\n\n\"Why, those members of the ruling classes who are intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present system \u2014 and they are many \u2014 have become the obtrusive and full-mouthed apostles of co-operative production.\" - Address of the General Council of the IWMA, 1871  \n  \n**But to the point**: when Marx talks about fixing cooperatives, he always says they should be made \"national\".\n\n\"To save the industrious masses, co-operative labor ought to be developed to national dimensions, and, consequently, to be fostered by national means.\" - IWMA 1864\n\n\"If co-operative production is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it is to supersede the Capitalist system; if united co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon a common plan, thus taking it under their own control, and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist production \u2014 what else, gentlemen, would it be but Communism, \u201cpossible\u201d Communism?\" - Address of the General Council of the IWMA, 1871\n\n\"Without the factory system arising out of the capitalist mode of production there could have been no co-operative factories. Nor could these have developed without the credit system arising out of the same mode of production. The credit system is not only the principal basis for the gradual transformation of capitalist private enterprises into capitalist stock companies, but equally offers the means for the gradual extension of co-operative enterprises on a more or less national scale. The capitalist stock companies, as much as the co-operative factories, should be considered as transitional forms from the capitalist mode of production to the associated one, with the only distinction that the antagonism is resolved negatively in the one and positively in the other.\" - Capital Vol 3 Ch 27\n\n**So here's my question**. I can't concretely find what he actually means by \"national\" dimensions or \"national\" production. The three options I can think of are as follows.\n\n1. State-owned enterprises. The most common definition of \"nationalization\", in line with state socialism.\n\n2. Yugoslav-style \"[worker's self management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_self-management)\". The state owns the business but the workers are free to make their own decisions within it.\n\n3. Market socialism. Cooperatives competing in a market system, but with cooperatives *completely* replacing traditional corporations. This one seems the least likely, but also makes the most sense when Marx is saying that \"national scale\" can be achieved through credit (that is to say, investment). State ownership through credit doesn't make much sense.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are there any other sources for his use of \"national scale\" that would clarify this?",

            "body": "First of all, you need to distinguish between co-operative labour, which is Marx's term for labour under communism, and co-operatives as enterprises. Marx viewed the latter \"positively\" in that they provided a direct demonstration that a separate capitalist was not necessary, and Marx and Engels increasingly viewed individual capitalists as obsolete even in capitalism, to the extent that they envisioned the capitalist state taking over the entire economy. Marx crucially did not say that communism would be a society of independent cooperatives. \n\n\"National\" here means that production would be organised and planned on a national level. As Marx puts it in Nationalisation of Land:\n\n'At the International Congress of Brussels, in 1868, one of our friends \\[C\u00e9sar De Paepe, in his report on land property: meeting of the Brussels Congress of the International Working Men's Association of Sept. 11 1868\\] said:\n\n\"Small private property in land is doomed by the verdict of science, large land property by that of justice. There remains then but one alternative. The soil must become the property of rural associations or the property of the whole nation. The future will decide that question.\"\n\nI say on the contrary; the social movement will lead to this decision that the land can but be owned by the nation itself. To give up the soil to the hands of associated rural labourers, would be to surrender society to one exclusive class of producers.\n\nThe nationalisation of land will work a complete change in the relations between labour and capital, and finally, do away with the capitalist form of production, whether industrial or rural. Then class distinctions and privileges will disappear together with the economical basis upon which they rest. To live on other people's labour will become a thing of the past. There will be no longer any government or state power, distinct from society itself! Agriculture, mining, manufacture, in one word, all branches of production, will gradually be organised in the most adequate manner. National *centralisation of the means of production* will become the national basis of a society composed of associations of free and equal producers, carrying on the social business on a common and rational plan. Such is the humanitarian goal to which the great economic movement of the 19th century is tending.'\n\nBy the end of Marx's life, he moved away from a national to a global perspective, driven by the development of the objective interconnections between formerly mostly isolated \"national\" economies.\n\nCrucially, the abolition of anarchy in production means that no market can exist.",

                    "body": ">you need to distinguish between co-operative labour, which is Marx's term for labour under communism, and co-operatives as enterprises\n\nBut he uses them near-interchangably. When he talks about a worker cooperative, he talks about that cooperative doing cooperative labor. When he says that the wealthy are propping up worker cooperatives to defang socialism, he refers to it as the \"co-operative labor system\" - as in, that's the labor system they're propping up.\n\nAnd he calls for \"the gradual extension of co-operative enterprises on a more or less national scale\" - that's explicitly saying we should be funding co-operatives as \"enterprises\" until they reach a certain level of power. Which ties into the statement that \"united co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon a common plan\".\n\nIn order to achieve that national production upon a common plan, co-operative enterprises need to be supported until they're strong enough to do so. That's the reading I'm seeing.\n\n>As Marx puts it in Nationalisation of Land:\n\nThis is a very useful point of reference. While it mostly specifically deals with *land* (even Georgists want nationalization of land and they're not even anti-capitalist), the part you italicized is pretty unambiguous since it outright uses the word \"centralization\".\n\nBut at the same time, we return to a similar problem: \"associations of free and equal producers, carrying on the social business on a common and rational plan\". Do you know what he meant by \"associations\"? If the entire economy is centralized into a singular production plan, what room is there for smaller associations? What power do they hold to deviate from that plan?",

He says credit allows this to happen, and sees this as the part of the process by which capitalism moves toward its end. Just as he and Engels would later see the replacement of individual capitalists by one state capitalist. I think it's instructive to quote Antiduhring here:\n\n\"This rebellion of the productive forces, as they grow more and more powerful, against their quality as capital, this stronger and stronger command that their social character shall be recognised, forces the capitalist class itself to treat them more and more as social productive forces, so far as this is possible under capitalist conditions. The period of industrial high pressure, with its unbounded inflation of credit, not less than the crash itself, by the collapse of great capitalist establishments, tends to bring about that form of the socialisation of great masses of means of production which we meet with in the different kinds of joint-stock companies. Many of these means of production and of communication are, from the outset, so colossal that, like the railways, they exclude all other forms of capitalistic exploitation. At a further stage of evolution this form also becomes insufficient: the official representative of capitalist society \u2014 the state \u2014 will ultimately have to undertake the direction of production. This necessity for conversion into state property is felt first in the great institutions for intercourse and communication \u2014 the post office, the telegraphs, the railways.\n\nIf the crises demonstrate the incapacity of the bourgeoisie for managing any longer modern productive forces, the transformation of the great establishments for production and distribution into joint-stock companies and state property shows how unnecessary the bourgeoisie are for that purpose. All the social functions of the capitalist are now performed by salaried employees. The capitalist has no further social function than that of pocketing dividends, tearing off coupons, and gambling on the Stock Exchange, where the different capitalists despoil one another of their capital. At first the capitalist mode of production forces out the workers. Now it forces out the capitalists, and reduces them, just as it reduced the workers, to the ranks of the surplus population, although not immediately into those of the industrial reserve army.\n\nBut the transformation, either into joint-stock companies, or into state ownership, does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies this is obvious. And the modern state, again, is only the organisation that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the general external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine, the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers \u2014 proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is rather brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution.\"\n\nThis is a process within capitalism that causes it to \"topple over\".\n\nIf there is a common social plan, then no one can deviate from it. Any association that is formed to oversee or manage one part of social production would have to follow it strictly. The producers being free does not mean their associations are free to do as they please.",

But, in doing this, it abolishes itself as proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, based upon class antagonisms, had need of the state, that is, of an organisation of the particular class, which was pro tempore the exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited classes in the condition of oppression corresponding with the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom, wage-labour). The state was the official representative of society as a whole; the gathering of it together into a visible embodiment. But it was this only in so far as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for the time being, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slave-owning citizens; in the Middle Ages, the feudal lords; in our own time, the bourgeoisie. When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary.\"\n\nSo this pretty clearly answers my question, as far as *Engels* is concerned. I'm not sure that Marx fully lines up with him but it's definitely useful data.\n\nI will say that the most exhausting part of reading socialist literature is that rather than simply saying \"here is what I believe\", Marx and Engels seem to delight in bringing up someone else's position and then just saying \"lol this is so stupid\" without expounding their own position. Anti-Duhring, Critique of Gotha, The German Ideology, Barracks Communism...\n\n>If there is a common social plan, then no one can deviate from it. Any association that is formed to oversee or manage one part of social production would have to follow it strictly.\n\nSo what is the point of an \"association\" if the association has no power? It's like dividing a country up into states and then not giving the states any legislative power or independence. Why not just say that there is a central plan and everyone is required to carry it out?",

(Note, I\u2019m just summarizing Marx\u2019s view, not weighing in on the feasibility of coops.)\n\nHis thought process is that:\n\n1. *Cooperatives resemble better social production relations*. There is something meaningful in them because give a glimpse of the future. Marx believed that productive relations were historically successive \u2013 capitalism was more modern than feudalism, which was more modern than Roman slavery, etc. Co-ops look (sort of) like what the successor to capitalism might look like: \u201cThey have shown that production on a large scale, and in accord with the behests of modern science, may be carried on without the existence of a class of masters employing a class of hands.\u201d\n2. *They aren\u2019t a real form of better social production relations*. They are like an artificial version (or simulation/practice grounds/microcosm/whatever you want to call it), because even if their internal dynamics resemble association, those dynamics do not replace the surrounding social conditions. (E.g., you and I start a shoe factory and actually do cooperatively manage it, but then we have to price things based on the surrounding economy, compete with other firms, buy materials from capitalist raw materials firms, etc.) They currently are a \u201csham,\u201d since they make it seem like we have attained free association, and a \u201csnare,\u201d since that makes us think we don\u2019t need to do something else to truly win a society based on free association.\n3. *He would take coops more seriously if they took over a national economy*. If suddenly France had a system based on co-ops, rather than a few co-ops completing with a global market, maybe we\u2019d be talking. That would mean that our shoe factory is getting leather from the cooperative cattle farm and raw materials from the capitalist miners, etc., and the people consuming our shoes would work at the farm, the mine, etc. However, Marx saw no evidence we were trending that way from the examples he saw, so his point is really to illustrate how these co-ops fall short of the alternative.\n\n\\-----\n\nI\u2019m generally against searching for Marx-approved models of the economy, since he didn\u2019t really talk much about them, so I\u2019d say look elsewhere. But I do think we can look at the diagnoses Marx gives, review later historical/theoretical examples, etc\n\nHowever, if you want something like Marx\u2019s impression, it\u2019s this: \u201c\u2026united co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon a common plan\u2026\u201d (from your IWMA quote). Marx says that \u201cunited co-operative societies\u201d work together to make a \u201ccommon plan.\u201d So he\u2019s imaging some kind of larger scale Society/Federation of smaller co-ops who work nationally to plan the economy and locally to manage production.\n\nBut remember, he doesn\u2019t really say that this is the best way to organize the economy, since he really weighing in on the legitimacy of then-current coops, not saying what his ideal world looks like.",

It seems pretty clear that he's explicitly using the existence of cooperatives as a path forward towards \"possible communism\" and I don't see any significant reason to interpret it otherwise.\n\n>disregarding the purposes of the texts they are from - one celebrates a militant insurrection; the other is a speech about many decades of practical struggle that briefly mentions that coops show capitalism isn't the only way to organize labor.\n\nI don't know what point you're trying to make. Building cooperatives up economically can coexist with \"militant insurrection\". I mean, he also said you can have electoral victory too:\n\n\"You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries\u2014such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland\u2014where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means. This being the case, we must also recognize the fact that in most countries on the Continent, the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labor.\" 1872 La Liberte speech\n\nBut more to the point: even if you use militant insurrection as your means to reach communism, \"militant insurrection\" isn't an economic system, is it? So you'd have to put an actual economic system in place. And we are discussing what that system is and how it would work.\n\n>PS: What is the relevance of you mentioning the state-owned economy?\n\nBecause that is what the word \"nationalized\" usually means.",

He doesn't say more than that, but I think it gives you a strong sense he's imagining some kind of national-level association of coops that discusses a broader scheme for production. It doesn't help totally answer the question of whether that national org is a representative one, how complex it is or how often it meets, whether all of society gets to vote on how many socks we make, or how small or large coops does he think we need to manage a national economy. Like a lot of Marx's most potent ideas, they are woven into the cracks of texts about other topics.  \n  \n\\---\n\nSince we're spinning in circles, I'll just make one broad methodological recommendation and leave you to it: If you are really interested in reading Marx, try to sort out your terms/components, and figure out how much they need to be worked over to get to where you want to go. As part of that process, assess what you can get from Marx and what you can't, and be transparent. \"Marx says X and Y, but he doesn't mention Z and he was wrong about X.\"  \n  \nIf what you are after is a veritable, authoritative endorsement of how coops might work or contribute to the socialist cause, it's just not there. You want the \"path forward\" toward communism question, as you put, but you're missing the exact middle term you need. Marx seems to say \"A is good and B is good\" and you're adding \"Therefore A causes B.\" Causes have no reason to resemble their effects, and you can't claim Marx believed one would cause the other because he said nice things about them both.\n\nIt's always a bummer Marx didn't write texts like *What is the Political and Economic Structure of Communism and How Do We Get There?* I wish he had. The good news is that you don't need him to give you this. He wrote incredible stuff and was amazingly prophetic. But he wasn't a prophet. He was also sometimes wrong. He definitely didn't know we'd need a litmus test for whether Stalin, Mao, or your friend's collective book store has the best solution. But there are great traditions of debate about this stuff. Go to them if you need that.",

If I just wanted to endorse market socialism I would have stopped there and plastered that quote in every leftist space I could. I'm here because I'm genuinely curious what Marx's meaning was when he talks about a national plan.\n\nu/Zandroe_ pointed me towards Anti-Duhring where Engels at least is explicitly in favor of state socialism.\n\n>But he wasn't a prophet. He was also sometimes wrong.\n\nOK? I'm not asking if he was *right in real life* or not. I'm asking what he was claiming. And he wasn't \"prophetic\", it wasn't magic. He analyzed existing patterns and saw where they would go. For example, \"automation will make it so eventually it is near-impossible for human employment to be justified\" aka the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. We are approaching that point now and it's just an extrapolation of the processes that already existed.",

I think Marx is trying to clarify that cooperatives, by themselves, are not enough, even if they make up the entire economy. They can all be critiqued for reproducing the same capitalist conditions when they are competing in the same ways that capitalist firms do. \n\nBut when cooperatives work together in united societies (maybe federations or something of the sort) that span nations, they can overcome those contradictions and run the economy democratically through decentralized, bottom up planning. And I assume that this would look like planning production to avoid things like overproduction on the one hand, and organizing additional institutions like mutual aid societies that are accessible to all of the workers on the other hand. \n\nBasically, Marx wants the workers to make the economy into a dual power structure with the cooperatives who will prefigure and lead the revolution",
