I was really moved by a line in Jesse Eisenberg's BAFTA acceptance speech last night, where he credits his wife for teaching him the \"Marxist Leninist principle that my grief is unexceptional compared to the rest of the world, which is what this movie is about.\" \n\nI have never seen anything about this concept in what I've read of Marx, and was curious if this rings a bell for anyone / if anyone could recommend where I can read more about this?\n\nLinking the speech for context. Thanks! [https://www.tiktok.com/@bbc/video/7472104342233845014](https://www.tiktok.com/@bbc/video/7472104342233845014)",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't know this man nor the film he won this award through but my assumption from this immediately is that he is fully aware of and empathetic to the class struggle despite the fact that he likely is fairly wealthy and does not face the same issues of exploitation to anywhere near the extent that the vast majority of the proletariat does. Therefore, his grief and struggles are relatively insignificant.",

One could hyper-focus on their own grief and separate themselves from others and their sense of community, or, they could look at grief collectively.\n\nIn the movie, his characters grief is isolating and awkward, which drives a wedge between him and his brother, who is much more outward person who holds his heart in his hand. There is a reveal when it becomes clear that the humanity of the more outward brother made a lasting impression on the group, while the isolated character was better behaved and had more going for him in life, but in many ways was worse off and selfish.",

I promise its somewhere.\n\nMao Zedong said something along these lines:\n\n\"Death is necessary, because, without death, there would be no change and the world would stagnate. If Confucius were alive among us today, that would be a bad thing. We shouldn't mourn death, but we should celebrate the life of someone.\n\nDeath is to be mourned when it is before the prime. We cannot allow our young saplings to die, because, the question then becomes 'Where will we get our seeds' \"\n\nI think this is  the correct view, that grief about the loss of someone in particular, isn't a very useful feeling, and should be directed into celebration for their life. But,  when someone has not been allowed to live, and, dies young, that is a true tragedy. \n\nDeath is necessary, its a good thing that we die, we must die. We must also be born.",

It's not a contest, but it IS the *duty* of privileged people to not let despair make them useless, especially in the face of marginalized people being active rather than giving in to despair themselves.\n\nI think a more appropriate analogy would be to say, if 4 people work in a mine and 1 of them is doing all the work while injured and sleep-deprived, it's bad ethos for the 3 who aren't doing much and just ate lunch after a good nap are giving up on digging because they just hit a patch of hard rock and it's going to be a lot of work to get through it. \n\nYou can grieve, but your grief is truly unexceptional compared to the 1/4 of your party that's been suffering the longest and hasn't given up yet.",

            "body": "I don't know of any specifically Marxist texts on grief. I take his comment to be about the broader lessons that getting into Marxist analysis offers. For me, developing a Marxist historical/cultural analysis has helped me see myself as a small particle in a massive movement of history, one among millions of other particles, each of which is a whole universe unto itself. When I get scared about fascism, or climate change, or my own little personal career or whatever, it's incredibly grounding and soothing to remind myself of how small I am, how swept up in historical events I am, and most importantly how NOT ALONE I am. I think of all the people around the world who have suffered, faced injustice, been terrorized, had their lives taken from them, by these historical currents, and it helps me bring context to my own fears. People have lived through so much horror and yet they have lived, and continued to love, fight, make art, laugh, get married...if they can do it, then so can I. \n\nIt's hard to tie this feeling directly to this or that Marxist method or text, but I really agree with Jesse Eisenberg (lol) that somehow getting deeply involved in this kind of critical-theoretical-political-historical work of learning and participating differently in the world does help create a frame for my personal struggles and sorrows that makes me feel connected to others, and that also weirdly helps me kind of \"let go\" a bit. Like a materialist version of realizing we are all in god's hands....",

I got involved in political action only through first re-centering myself via this kind of  transformation of myself. By all the same reasoning in my original post, there's no reason not to be brave and do scary things in pursuit of political goals, because again, you think of everyone else who has done so across history, you stop seeing your own personal life as so important that it uniquely needs to be safeguarded and protected and held back.",
