    "selftext": "Hello everyone! First time poster here!\nI am interested in an honest discussion on the state of internationalism in most Marxist circles. While I try to stay up to date on theory, I\u2019d be lying if I said that I sometimes struggle to attend local labor and socialist orgs, so I am curious to ask the members here what the common consensus on the ground is on internationalism vs support for SIOC. I am not here to spark the debate between the two ideas, just curious to see how invested (if at all) the common, practicing Marxists are in the advancement of the International Proletariat vs investment in local, national level change.

It's a opened debate that must be resolved in the field of the Marxist praxis. Personally I'm member of an international, I believe that we, the proletariat, have no nation. Therefore our fight it's against the bourgeoisie, all bourgeoisie.",

            "body": "To reflect on the question that proletarian internationalism has as its starting point national action, Gramsci follows in his response to Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution (revisionist):\n\n\"Notebook 14, \u00a7 68\n\nWritten (with questions and answers) by Giuseppe Bessarione [Stalin] in September 1927 on some essential points of political science and art. The point that seems to me to be made is the following: how, according to the philosophy of praxis [Marxism] (in its political manifestation) both in the formulation of its founder [Marx], but especially in the clarification of its most recent great theoretician [Lenin], the international situation must be considered in its national aspect. In fact, the \"national\" relationship is the result of a unique (in a certain sense) \"original\" combination that, in this originality and singularity, must be understood and conceived if one wants to dominate and direct it. Of course, the development is towards internationalism, but the starting point is \"national\"  and it is from this starting point that we must begin. But the perspective is international and can only be so. Therefore, it is necessary to study exactly the composition of the national forces that the international class will have to direct and develop in accordance with international perspectives and guidelines. The ruling class is such only if it interprets exactly this combination, of which it itself is a component and, as such, can give the movement a certain direction in certain perspectives. This point, I think, is the fundamental disagreement between Leone Davidovici [Trotsky] and Bessarione [Stalin] as interpreters of the majority [Bolshevik] movement. The accusations of nationalism are ineffective if they refer to the heart of the matter. If we study the effort from 1902 to 1917 by the majority [Bolsheviks], we see that its originality consists in purifying internationalism of every vague and purely ideological (in the worst sense) element in order to give it a realistic political content.  The concept of hegemony is one in which national needs are nested and it is understood how certain tendencies of this concept do not speak or only touch it (....)\"",

One of the pitfalls of many historical revolutions was the need to deal with the internal contradictions in \"backwards\" countries dominated by the peasantry, which led to SIOC. A hundred years later, ~90% of the world population is proletarianized now. Nearly everyone in the world now shares a common experience of class antagonism with the bourgeoisie. More than anything else, I believe this is what makes internationalism possible.",

            "body": "ETA: Not all Marxists are ML but here's my ML opinion:\n\n\n\nMarxism-Leninism upholds internationalism while also following SIOC as the reality of uneven global development. You may be thinking of the trotskyist position of permanent revolution.\n\n\n\nGenerally, MLs still uphold internationalism, but there are essentially 3 distinct \"trends\" with different interpretations on what exactly that means. Depending on which one you agree with most, there are Russian-style chauvinists, Greek-style dogmatists, and Chinese-style revisionists; referring to the KPRF, KKE, and CPC, respectively. Folks tend to align more or less with one of them, or a combination, although there are some big contradictions. The CPC is the most hated, but is also the most influential in broader international development and the Global South. Notably, all 3 of them (as well as the governing parties of Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, and Korea) are fraternal Parties in the IMCWP, which was set up by the KKE following the USSR's dissolution. \n\n\n\nThe KPRF wants to bring back the glory days of the USSR, and entails a degree of chauvinism, although afaik they support multipolarity and are less anti-China since the split was resolved in the late-80s\n\n\n\n\nThe CPC wants to pursue its own path (SWCC) while supporting international development and foregoing direct confrontation in favor of (a heavily Socialist-oriented) multipolar order; critics say that's revisionism and imperialism, respectively\n\n\n\nThe KKE afaik has closer ties with the KPRF and maintains similar positions, but claims CPC is revisionist and that China is an imperialist power alongside the US and post-Soviet Russia \n\n\n\nTLDR contemporary MLs all agree that internationalism is good and needs to develop, but there are competing trends with deep disagreements on what exactly that actually means \n\n\n\n(I'm a pro-China ML but tried to make this \"balanced\")",
