    "selftext": "Hey guys! I've been struggling to find some good literature that would be sort of historiography on Russian revolution (the October one) and the Russian Civil War/intervention. I am fluent in Russian so books in Russian or by Soviet thinkers would be appreciated.\nI've read some contemporary literature including \"Empire must die\" by Zygar but I've found that the narrative is very biased towards bourgeois revolution and very anti Lenin. I'd like to read up some Marxist analysis of the revolution. But not to crazy \"Lenin can do no wrong\" type either. \nDo y'all have something like this in mind? \nThanks on advance!",

English is not my native language and I just read the text a little bit fast and I missed some important parts of your request  (I really apologize about that). \n\nWell, the reason that I didn't put more theory/journalist books about the civil war is because two reasons.\n\n1.- Some books I recommended, such as the one on Lenin or the one about the history of the Communist Party,  talk a lot about the civil war. \n\n2.- I couldn't find those titles in English since I have them in Spanish. \n\nBut, I can't give you the names of the authors, Most of them are Soviets, and maybe you can find them by your owne since it looks that you really know where to find books on russian (I hope I didn't sound a bit rude here, that's not my intention.). \n\nI will try to translate the title as best as possible and give you the publisher of the books hoping that you can find them in Russian or English. \n\nThese books belong to a Soviet collection of Novosti publishing house called *The truth about the socialist revolution and the creation of the USSR*  talks about the revolution as well as the civil war: \n\n- *How the Soviets were created* by Vitali Startsev\n\n-  *The fall of the Russian empire* by Avenir Korelin and Stanislav Tiutiukin\n\n- *The russian civil war, causes, essence and meaning* by Yuri Poliakov\n\n And maybe you can take a look of the Trotsky's books *how we did the October revolution* and his memories of the Russian revolution in two volumes.\n\nAlso the book by Osip Piatnitsky *memories of a Bolshevik* can be useful for you.",
