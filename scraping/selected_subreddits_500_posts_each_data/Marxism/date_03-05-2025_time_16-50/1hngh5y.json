    "selftext": "Hello everyone. Im writing a research paper on the topic of evaluating the role of peasants in revolutionary movements via a comparative study of the works of Marx, Lenin and Mao and understanding their modern relevance. I did want to research on Trotskyst perspectives but decided against it. \n\nAs of now, Ive read a few works of Marx like the Manifesto, 18th Brumarire of Louis Napoleon, Letters to Zasulich, Capital (Vol I, On the So called Primitive Accumulation) and two secondary sources on a marxist perspective on food theory and their views on the russian communes. Im currently reading State and the Revolution by Lenin but cant find more sources. Are there any other works I could read to solidify my paper (particularly for Lenin and Mao but im happy to read more on Marx if u think there is something imp) ? Thank you in advance!",

            "body": "You can read on the Agrarian question in Russia, By Lenin, and also the development of capitalism in Russia (even though the 2nd one does not directly deal with the peasant question per se), the second work is far more important, as it examines how the corvee system is being done away with, and how Russia, is slowly transitioning to capitalism, it also deals with the dual nature of the peasantry (cw, vol 3, p.31), and many more important points missed by the populist Narodnik faction \\[**also contrary to popular belief, Lenin actually recognized the revolutionary potential of the peasantry, however, through the course of the revolution, several idealogical trends, began to manifestly develop within the peasant class structure, some of which showcased the petty bourgeois side of the peasantry**\\]. With regards to Mao, there is a veritable goldmine of texts, I can present around 4 here\n\n1. Mao (1926), 'Analysis of the classes in Chinese society'\n2. Mao (1927), 'Report on an investigation of the peasant movement in Hunan' \\[his more detailed works\\]\n3. Mao (1937), 'On practise'\n4. Mao (1955), 'On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation'\n\nI hope this helps!.",
