My question is, isn't Capital on improvement on violence as a means to get people to do something they don't want to do (ie work?)\n\nThe short answer is yes, Marx viewed capitalism as a progressive force and provided a set of formal freedoms that the medieval peasant lacked. But there's also a no, capitalism is still rife with unfreedom and coercion. \n\nHowever, Marx argues that the relations of production inhibit the full development and utilisation of the means of production. In simplified language this means: we have all this cool stuff and technology that we can make use of but because someone has to make a profit, all that cool stuff isn't produced for the right ends (getting everyone health care/medicine/more free time rather than working more. Alongside a whole bunch of other issues.\n\nI would also keep in mind that the development and imposition of capitalism itself was an incredibly violent process historically. Capitalism did not peacefully and naturally develop out if people trading stuff.",

My question is, isn't Capital on improvement on violence as a means to get people to do something they don't want to do (ie work?).\n\nMarx tends to view capitalism as creating the best system with the most misery relative to its potential. In the past, people starved because there was no food. Now, people starve despite there being enough food. Less of the population is starving but considering there is a greater abundance than ever to feed them, it's a different type of horror. \n\nFeudal societies enforced labor disciplin mostly through convention and stratification. Your lord and king and God called you to be a peasant which comes with certain obligations and you must do them to be an upright member of society. The lords and kings also have duties to you in return. At times this was enforced by violence. Marx says a similar thing about capitalism:\n\n\"The capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible, and to make, whenever possible, two working days out of one. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working day to one of definite normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides.\" (Marx, Capital Vol. 1, Ch 10, section 1)\n\nSo, in some ways, capitalism is an improvement on the past systems. In other ways it seems more monstrous. In other ways, it seems exactly the same. Hard to say one is strictly better or worse than the other. Depends heavily on your personal values and taste. \n\n>Further, are Communist economies necessarily de-growth/local?\n\n>Surely in a fully Communist society, people would not voluntarily build 747s or go into coal mines, right? Wouldn't it be a more pastoral kinda of life?\n\nGreat question! No, Communism isn't necessarily degrowth or pastoral. [Here's](https://endnotes.org.uk/posts/forest-and-factory) a favorite article of mine that hits on exactly this subject. Here's a great quote:\n\n\"But, again, it is extremely difficult to predict exactly what even seemingly straightforward activities such as manufacturing a certain good might look like within communist society because the current technical methods for producing any given artifact are inextricably bound to standards of \"efficiency\" (of profit, labor discipline, etc.) that express distinctly capitalist imperatives. These imperatives often seem to take on a sort of malicious agency in our lives. Bordiga describes industrial fixed capital as \"the enemy Monster that hangs over the mass of producers,\" monopolizing the collective knowledge of the human species such that \"this Monster is killing science itself, misgoverning it, criminally exploiting its fruits, squandering the heritage of future generations.\" Even if scientific knowledge is key to the future of communism, then, the forces of production are not a neutral algorithmic apparatus that can be simply seized and run for better ends\u2014they are the literal embodiment of the Monster that stands against us.\"\n\nBasically, it's hard to predict exactly how something like mining would be done because the goals of a communist society are so different from our current one. That doesn't stop us from speculating (the article does A LOT of very scientific and fun and imaginitive speculation on how production and distribution would be done under communism). But we have to be aware that communism is a complex anthropoligical transformation akin to the neolithic revolution, not a 12-step program. \n\nThe general goal of communist society is for everyone to manage production to maximize people's free time for self-development. Maybe there are enough geologists who really like rocks that they can volunteer to mine certain materials. Maybe, people would need to be required to put a few hours into the mines every week. Maybe a society develops a coming-of-age ritual where young men descend into the mines en masse equiped with the latest mining technology for a period of time and return with minerals representing their metamorphosis into adulthood. It's impossible to tell. It could be all of these things at different places.\n\nGenerally, I don't think communism will be all that localist. But that's a big split among communists.",

            "body": "Note that violence is still at the root of capitalism. It becomes most obvious in the stage that Marx calls 'primitive accumulation' in Capital, but even in 'advanced' capitalist societies this is still the case, just more nuanced. If you are pretty well off, you go to work on the threat that you could find yourself in an uncomfortable situation if something were to prevent you from finding equally high-paying jobs in the future. And you inevitably (at a certain age) start thinking 'what if X happens to me, do I have enough banked up to deal with that?'\n\nThe threat becomes much more obvious and immediate if you're a part of the large fraction (if not majority) of people that lives paycheck to paycheck (or close to it). Can you really afford to confront your abusive boss? How will you pay rent next month if things go south? What will happen to you if you're evicted? Etc.\n\nSo while it's all good questions to ask, and many communist parties have answered them in (imo) pretty bad ways. But it's always good to look at the violence we usually don't see because it is embedded in the system we grew in.",

            "body": "For the first question, Marx does not deny that capitalism is an improvement on previous modes of production. However, capitalism is still a system enforced through systemic and direct violence. Systemic as in if you dont work you can't buy food, afford a place to live, get healthcare etc. and literal as in the police violently suppressing protests and union activity, the fbi murdering and threatening socialists and civil rights leaders, the cia assassinating foreign leaders, supporting coups, and funding/training death squads abroad, and finally the military invading countries in imperialist wars meant to suppress national liberation movements or drive up profits for defense contractors, and other economic incentives depending on the specific war. \n\nFor the second point, returning to a more agrarian society would actually be what Marx and Engles called \"reactionary socialism\" as it returns to a previous from of production, which is not only impossible but would neccesarily create class based rule similar to that under historical agrarian societies. Communism in fact centralizes the means of production, as one of Marx and Engels main critiques of capitalism was the \"anarchy of production\" which means that production is made up of a bunch of independent producers competing with eachother and not acting according to a common plan. Under communism the means of production would be centralized under the dictatorship of the proletarian (dictatorship had a different meaning when Marx was using it, meaning something like \"absolute control\") and would most likely be directed by a series of workers councils based around specific industries, subordinated to regional or national workers councils, producing according to a common plan based on societal need. Hope that helps, if you have any other questions feel free to ask",

            "body": "Re the \"pastoral kind of life\" part of your question...\n\nI'm not sure how you view degrowth, as a good or bad idea. It's necessary to a degree because of ecological limits. This is not a Marxist perspective though. Not that it is really in contradiction with it, imo. The point is to overcome the profit motive as the main driver of the economy, and instead address human needs. Since survival is at stake, we would implement rational policies that address the ecological limits. An economy driven by the profit motive cannot do this, instead it \"capitalizes\" on environmental destruction.\n\nIf the reason why you ask is not related to the ecological crisis, but instead you are interested in how our life experience would be like...\n\nThe point is not a return to the past, but to rid ourselves of the alienation which we have now. People yearning for the past fantasize about a way of life without alienation, with a meaningful connection with themselves, nature, their work, and others, and will imagine that as having been the case in the past, whether it was like that or not in whatever past they are imagining.\n\nWe do come originally from a primitive communism, but it is not the Marxist perspective to return to this, the point is to recognize the alienation, more generally the immiseration of the working class, and to recognize that the source is their relationship with work and the living conditions which are forced upon them based on their income mostly.\n\nUltimately though, regardless of how you understand the social justice, alienation, or ecological crisis... The \"scientific\" side of Marxism is understanding the economical and social dynamics which result from the fact that people will defend their own interests, how societies will evolve, what struggles will take place, and so on.",

My question is, isn't Capital on improvement on violence as a means to get people to do something they don't want to do (ie work?).\n\nYes and no. Many people think that communism and capitalism are like walking down the path of feudalism then coming to a fork in the road where you have to pick one or the other. In actuality it is more like a series of progression where it goes Feudalism -> Mercantilism/Capitalism -> Socialism/Communism. Capitalism was the next step on the road to communism, we just started dragging our feet and moving as slow as possible instead on continuing on the path. This is what Marx was warning about and critiquing in Capital. That capitalism is a good stepping stone but if we stop on it \\*here\\* are all of the problems that will arise and why we cant stop on it. Those issues being the underlaying coercive nature which is still violent to an extent. Instead of pointing a gun in your face and saying give me rent or ill shoot you it's now give me rent or I'll let you starve on the street (and let the cops harass you and *they* do have guns).\n\n>Further, are Communist economies necessarily de-growth/local?\n\nAgain, yes and no. Socialism isn't inherently but by nature of living in a finite world with finite resources at some point scales of production will have to cut back. Marx never could have predicted anthropogenic climate change.\n\n>Surely in a fully Communist society, people would not voluntarily build 747s or go into coal mines, right? Wouldn't it be a more pastoral kinda of life?\n\nThis is a rather complex question to answer. There are three different routes to answer this I could go but I'll give a brief summary of each:  \n1) Humans are odd. What someone may find abhorrent someone else may take pride in doing. Or one person may see it as \"I don't want to do this job but this is a job that *needs* to be done and I am willing to do it for the sake of the greater good.  \n2) Innovation. A job such as a coal miner is looked down upon due to the poor heath associated risk. You would think the pay to compensate is what makes up for it but in the united states a coal miner makes an average of 45k a year. Not a lot. People take these jobs for more cultural reasons (my pappy was a miner and his pappy before him so I may as well go work the mines). But as innovation makes these jobs more safer or rules them out (say if we found a way to live solely off renewable energy).  \n3) Lack of ownership and stake in these jobs. If you had a say in your workplace and could vote on safety regulations and standard operating procedures you would take more pride in your workplace and perhaps have less of an issue doing a job that we now see as sucky.  \nAnother proposal is market socialism. People would still make money to have the feeling of attaining and saving for luxury good like a new TV or fancy car, but things like food, housing, healthcare, education, etc would all be provided for free through taxes and such. The stress that comes from \"man I have to go work a job I dont want to do in order to put 2/3rd of my pay to rent and the rest into food and bills\" would basically be eliminated and could be reframed into \"im going to this job that I have a stake in due to collective ownership of the means of production, to make money to buy that new fangled gizmo I want\"",
