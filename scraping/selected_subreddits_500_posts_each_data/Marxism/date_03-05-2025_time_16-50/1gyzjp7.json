    "selftext": "So I've managed to explain leftist stuff to a few people in my life, but I have to move around alot, mostly to places without any real orgs to speak of, and alot of the people, once I leave, fall into the internet left rabbit hole. I wake up almost every morning to thirty memes, \"explanations\" of why the ACP are actually really cool, theories on which Facebook pages are feds, and screenshots of very proud comment section trolling in my inbox, mostly from two people. It's concerning and also incredibly annoying, but there's not much I can really do from the other side of the continent. Trying to explain how unproductive it is goes nowhere. I don't know what to do, and one of them is family so I can't exactly cut them off. None of people I work with here have any real idea because I'm now in a big city with plenty of orgs that they don\u2019t generally have a problem getting them to come out to and gently try to pull them back to reality through. \n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen and if so, is there any way to correct it? There's really no orgs to point them at and they \"explain\" stuff to people by making themselves as insufferable as possible and reciting twitter takes (literally), so there's not much hope for, say, getting people interested enough to start a reading group or something, and too burnt out from work to get into mutual aid or really anything offline. I'm at a loss for what to do and also just pretty sick of it.",

The internet, especially social media, is not just a poor analogue for real social interactions, it is _no_ analogue at all. I treat it like a completely different world, with completely different social mores. I think being terminally online has been something of a new opiate for the masses; a distraction from alienation from ones own labour. The more creative or productive you are in real life, the more you realise how little difference the online world really makes at the end of the day when it comes to interactions of workers in the real world. Those who are not as class conscious don't strive for this distraction, this alternative.",

But I think for alot of people it's more about exhaustion from the real world. The internet isn't just a distraction, it's an accessible one which, at least with the people I know, can feel like \"something\"  without the barrier to entry of actual work. The worst offender is in his 70s and still works ten hours a day at a physically demanding job, so in his case I think it's a matter of genuine exhaustion as much as, if not more than, preferring the false reality, though there's definitely quite a bit of that as well. Just a shame there's not much that can be done about it.",

For these people, Marxism is simply an identity-commodity to affirm themselves as this or that thing.\n\nBut that's a more general thing. In your case, they support the ACP... Which means these are deeply reactionary people with bigger issues than lack of seriousness. I would cut them off, family or not. For more normal people, you should keep them away from internet leftist culture, YouTube videos, and tell them to hit the books.",

But in the case of one of them, oddly the worse one, they're falling for the ACP while actively trying to educate themselves on race, LGBT issues, etc. which those types generally denounce. He's asked me a few times why they're like that and talked about how that part seems stupid. I think the problem is more looking at it with internet-tinted glasses that make it look like a big org with thousands of subscribers, likes, or whatever as opposed to, say, my little education group that gets ~50 people to come out on a good day and doesn't talk about how we're gonna slaughter the bourgeoisie next week. Wierder still, he actually hits the books pretty hard. When I moved I left all my books with him and every now and then he'll bring up something from one of them that he thinks is interesting. The internet stuff seems more like a lack of outreach skills combined with a lack of an established outlet combining into myopia moreso than any serious reactionary sentiment.",

If you don't want to cut off a loved one and you can withstand the cringe of their early adventures in left wing communism, simply resolve yourself to be a patient and positive presence in their life.\n\nACP is insufferable AF but I can absolutely understand how a boomer would find that aesthetic (and lets be real, that's almost all ACP is) complementary to their worldview... I commented a few days ago on a post about ACP with a story of my own experience with them IRL and it is not a flattering image. Based on that alone, I would actually not be surprised if ACP turned out to be the fed response to marx's continued rising popularity, but ultimately they are not worth much attention. Many of their takes are demonstrably reactionary and that is what I would focus on discussing with your loved ones. \n\nI might also suggest reading Togliatti's [Lectures on Fascism](https://archive.org/details/LecturesOnFascism/page/n9/mode/2up) and Georgi Dimitrov on the [Main Report at the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/dimitrov/works/1935/08_02.htm) as both go in depth on the tactics used by fascists to win over sections of the working class.",

It\u2019s a challenge many face when introducing complex ideologies to others, especially in environments where healthy outlets for engagement\u2014like organized groups or constructive activism\u2014aren\u2019t readily available. \n\nA helpful starting point might be encouraging them to explore history critically and in depth, especially focusing on the successes and failures of leftist movements.   \n  \nFor example, understanding how past efforts have gone astray\u2014whether through centralized control leading to authoritarianism, economic mismanagement causing widespread suffering, or even well-meaning movements being co-opted or corrupted\u2014can help ground their thinking in reality.   \n  \nEncouraging reading or thoughtful discussions about how idealism has sometimes led to devastating outcomes, such as the purges in Stalin\u2019s USSR or the famines during Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward, could spark a more reflective and balanced perspective.   \n  \nThese are lessons not to scare people off but to emphasize the importance of keeping human rights and individual dignity front and center.\n\nLastly, it might help to shift the focus from abstract theorizing to practical, people-centered action. Even if mutual aid or local groups aren\u2019t possible, small steps\u2014like supporting a community initiative or volunteering\u2014can connect ideas to tangible results.  \n  \n If someone\u2019s passionate about change but isn\u2019t considering the real-world effects of their behavior, reminding them that ideas are only as good as the lives they improve could steer them toward a more grounded and empathetic approach.",

                    "body": "Marx and Engels do not tolerate petty-bourgeois socialism that complains about economic planning and wants to create a society of petty-bourgeois and cooperatives competing with each other in the market. I will start with two quotes to prove my point:\n\n>The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State,\u00a0i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.\n\n>Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.\n\n>These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.\n\n>Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.\n\n>1.Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.\n\n>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\n\n>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.\n\n>4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\n\n>5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.\n\n>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.\n\n>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.\n\n>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\n\n>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.\n\n>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children\u2019s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c.\n\n>When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.\n\n>In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\n\n>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848)\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm)",

                    "body": "Here is the second quote with an explanation of the lower phase of communism:\n\n\n\n>Let us take, first of all, the words \"proceeds of labor\" in the sense of the product of labor; then the co-operative proceeds of labor are the total social product.  \n\n\n>From this must now be deducted: First, cover for replacement of the means of production used up. Second, additional portion for expansion of production. Third, reserve or insurance funds to provide against accidents, dislocations caused by natural calamities, etc.  \n\n\n>These deductions from the \"undiminished\" proceeds of labor are an economic necessity, and their magnitude is to be determined according to available means and forces, and partly by computation of probabilities, but they are in no way calculable by equity.  \n\n\n>There remains the other part of the total product, intended to serve as means of consumption.  \n\n\n>Before this is divided among the individuals, there has to be deducted again, from it: First, the general costs of administration not belonging to production. This part will, from the outset, be very considerably restricted in comparison with present-day society, and it diminishes in proportion as the new society develops. Second, that which is intended for the common satisfaction of needs, such as schools, health services, etc. From the outset, this part grows considerably in comparison with present-day society, and it grows in proportion as the new society develops. Third, funds for those unable to work, etc., in short, for what is included under so-called official poor relief today.  \n\n\n>Only now do we come to the \"distribution\" which the program, under Lassallean influence, alone has in view in its narrow fashion \u2013 namely, to that part of the means of consumption which is divided among the individual producers of the co-operative society.  \n\n\n>The \"undiminished\" proceeds of labor have already unnoticeably become converted into the \"diminished\" proceeds, although what the producer is deprived of in his capacity as a private individual benefits him directly or indirectly in his capacity as a member of society.  \n\n\n>Just as the phrase of the \"undiminished\" proceeds of labor has disappeared, so now does the phrase of the \"proceeds of labor\" disappear altogether.  \n\n\n>Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of total labor. The phrase \"proceeds of labor\", objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity, thus loses all meaning.  \n\n\n>What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.  \n\n\n>Karl Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875)\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm)\n\nThe Critique of the Gotha Programme was written after the paris commune and Capital volume 1, any fanciful interpretation that contradicts this text with fear of planning the economy must be discarded.",
