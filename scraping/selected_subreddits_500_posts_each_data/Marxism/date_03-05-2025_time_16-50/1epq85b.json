But technically everytime a boom happened the market can simply assume another price, just this time with a different ratio to the true material value. Then the price will fall, then boom, then another assumption, and so on and so forth.\n\nSo capitalism won't fall, but will turn into a cycle of hell.\n\nSo yeah, do you think this is true?",

Value is the congealed labour power within the same good or service. Price, generally speaking, varies in and around value (like it is anchored to it, but pulled in different directions by supply and demand).\n\nIt is not clear what you mean by 'assume another price'. I certainly don't recognise it as a phrase used in Marxist analyses of capitalism.",

But after a boom, we assume a new price.\n\nLike this: For example, the current ratio of price to material value is 10 : 1, so for every 1 material value (quantified and simplified, in reality it is a lot more complex) the equiv. in the market is 10 Dollars (oversimplification, not counting wage system and etc). A product is labeled 10 Dollars. Later due to advancement in technology, the material value dropped, thus the price will follow.\n\nThen a boom happened, thus the market will assume another ratio, and so on and so forth.",

The long and short of it is that businesses/corporations set their prices to maximum the amount they can get while being competitive against other producers of the same service/product. I don't know where you learned economics, but it is an unnecessary overcomplication to speak of it in those terms.",

Since capitalism has practically evolved into economic tripartism with the bourgeoisie as the new feudal lords, they don't need to be competitive. Because they can form some kind of oligarchy. Thus no competition. In fact the global oil market has reached this point.\n\nEdit: What I mean about this is that since there is not competition anymore, they are free to control the market to assume a new price.",

Many businesses have set prices higher, largely because they are in a position of monopoly or duopoly and control a vital commodity (food, oil - gas, electric and water are atrocious for this in the UK, to the point that people have frozen to death because they can't pay their utility bill).",

            "body": "That is not what \"The tendency of rate of profit to fall\" mean. It has nothing to do with price.\n\nExample. A construction company a 200 years ago. It tools, it capital were baskets, shovels, baggies, ropes. Tools were very cheap compare to cost of labor. Buildings sites had hundreds of workers. But then more machines were invented, making workers more productive. So, now, if you come to construction site you see very few workers and lot of costly machinery.\n\nCost of Capital per workers have tendency to increase. That mean, that when worker work, Capitalist have to take more and more of his productivity to pay for capital. 200 Years ago, something like 10% of worker productivity went to capitalist, the rest went to wages. Now this number is something like 95%.\n\nThere are contra tendencies, come from jumps in technology. For example, when personal computers were invented. Before there was only mainframes, which cost million per programmer. Personal computers drop this cost to a few thousandth $. But now this tendency back in power. Amount of programming tools one have to have per programmer become very expensive.\n\nAnd that why rate of profit fall, because cost of Capital per workers has tendency to grow. And price can not fix it, as who will buy something of that high price? Worker who now paid 5% of his productivity compare to 90% 200 years ago?\n\n\n\n#",

            "body": "It is an interesting take. What you are saying is what Marx describes as the difference between the general rate of profit and general general prices of production.   \nThe true material value can be expressed as the general rate of profit, which operates as an average. Let's say a boom  occured in a specific sector in an economy. A sudden boom indicates an area with above-average profits. Given that the general rate of profit operate as an average for every single capital, the individual capitals that invest and move to this booming sector will simultaneously equalize that above-average profit area. The boom therefore has a time limit. It is only above-average profit for the initiating individual capitals. Once everyone else follow through, equalization happens and the window for super-profits disappears. From a capitalist perspective, patents is a way to secure above-average profits for fixed amount of time, to combat this mechanism. However, on top of all this we have general prices of production, another average that evolves around the profit rate - sometimes in opposite movements. However, prices will always be tied to the real value, to the profit rate.   \n\n\nI think this is somewhat similar to what you are saying (?).   \n  \nPrices can obscur the real movement of true material value, which backfires through increased inflation, for example. Even if the market assumes new prices after a boom, it must always account for the underlying real movement of value, i.e the general rate of profit.",
