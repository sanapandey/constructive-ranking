Use value is what the commodity is used for. For example, a toothbrush is used to brush one's teeth while a chair is used to sit in. This usefulness is dependent upon the physical properties of the commodity and is not subjective in the marginalist understanding of the term. The Marginalists were drawing on the older utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham's idea that individuals are utility maximizers. Marx was well aware of Bentham, and his account of value is designed to be compatible with Bentham's understanding of humanity, but Marx was not interested in the idea that individuals were utility maximizers. He focused on the commodity, itself, because he was analyzing capitalist society, in particular, and he believed that the mass manufacture of commodities is one of the key distinguishing features of capitalism.\n\n> What is exchange value exactly?\n\nA commodity is also an exchange value. Its exchange value is whatever that commodity is exchanged for. Commodities can technically be bartered, but in a capitalist society, they are normally exchanged for money which Marx considers to be the universal commodity.\n\n> Objective value, according to Marx (at least based on my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong), is dependant on socially-neccessary labour.\n\nA commodity is also a value. Value is the shared equivalent which exists between exchanged commodities. It is *socially constructed* when commodities are placed in an exchange relationship (when they are bought and sold). (The idea that value is a social construction is also one of the key differences between Marx and the Marginalists. For the latter valuing is human nature and so capitalist exchange is characteristic of all human societies.) The substance of value is \"socially necessary labor time.\" The form that value takes is money, so value is measured monetarily (though a commodity's price also reflects things other than its value). In the long run, a commodity's price is assumed to correspond to that commodity's value (to the labor time necessary to create it) while in the short run the price may deviate from the value. Value is the center of gravity for prices.\n\nA commodity that is not a use value would not be exchanged and so would not have value at all.\n\n> Automation and machines will reduce the objective value (due to lowering the effort needed for the product), while socially-neccessary labour will increase the objective value (due to the additional effort needed for the product), is this correct?\n\nCommodities which require less socially necessary labor time (the substance of value) to be expended in their creation will generally have lower prices.\n\n>Is there some kind of \"math equation\" that use the three values mentioned above to predict prices, supply, demand, etc?\n\nDoes there need to be? We are not terribly interested in managing capitalist society; we are interested in eliminating it. Moreover, the above concepts are derived from Smith and Ricardo, though Marx places a greater focus on teasing out the implications for labor and on identifying the historical specificity of capitalism. If there is no irreconcilable tension between neoclassical economics and those thinkers, then there wouldn't be any between Marx and them either.\n\n>I would appreciate more if you folks begin to do more \"practical commentary\"... more than just \"I hate capitalism\" to non-Marxists,\n\nMarx's account of value suggests that workers in a capitalist society are in an unfortunate situation. Their lives (literally their time) is the source of the capitalist class's profit (at least in a pure form of capitalism). This means that the working class must be disciplined in order for profit to occur. There are plenty of Marxist accounts of what this disciplining looks like in practice. Leo Pantich and Sam Gindin's [The Making of Global Capitalism: The Political Economy of American Empire](https://www.versobooks.com/products/2267-the-making-of-global-capitalism) is a really good place to start. So is Doug Henwood's [Wall Street: How it Works and For Whom](https://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/WSDownload.html). Those texts don't make much use of the Marxian terminology, but they extend the core point of Marx's analysis to the present day: the way capital accumulation presupposes an undemocratically disciplined work force.",

            "body": ">Is use-value essentially the subjective value that is dependant upon the person (e.g. how useful x is to me, etc) ?\n\nThere is no such thing as subjective value. Use value is also determined objectively. There's nothing arbitrary about the social needs fulfilled by the consumption of commodities. They are also determined objectively by the biological evolution of human beings and the historical development of society at the basis of which lie its productive forces.\n\nThe point of the distinction between use and exchange value is that the characteristics of commodities which allow them to fulfill needs are not quantities that are commnesurable in the exchange of commodities.\n\nFor example, the number of calories of a certain food and the weight of a certain metal, while they are relevant to the satisfaction of different needs, have nothing to do with the proportions in which they are being exchanged for one another. \n\nEven if you reduce the commodities to their elementary particles, their respective physical quantities which render them useful are only a measure of use relative to concrete needs. The needs would have to be the same for the quantities to be commensurable in terms of usefulness. But in the simple exchange of commodities, the whole point is that people with different needs exchange commodities they don't need for the commodity they need. \n\nClearly the two exchanged commodities will satisfy different needs, and so the proportion in which they are exchanged is not based on the incommensurable needs that are being satisfied.\n\nIf the commensurable quantity in commodities isn't use value or any of their physical properties, there must be something else, since we do quantitatively compare commodities.\n\nEnter exchange value (for the purposes of this discussion, one can take exchange value to be synonymous with value). Exchange value, contrary to use value, is a purely **social relation**. Physical factors enter into the determination of use value, but there are no physical factors entering into the determination of exchange value.\n\nExchange value is determined by the socially necessary labor time (SNLT) to produce a commodity. What is being produced is irrelevant. One hour of abstract social labor can produce an infinite combination of different physical things depending on the society in which it is performed. It is entirely relative to that society's organisation ; really think of the meaning of the term \"socially necessary\" or \"average\" in the expression SNLT.\n\nThis is why value, the content of which is SNLT, is a social category, not a physical one.\n\n>Objective value, according to Marx (at least based on my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong), is dependant on socially-neccessary labour. So technically it is the value that \"links\" the material world and the product. e.g. if there is a kid toothbrush, use-value is how useful the toothbrush is to the person, while objective value is the material value of the product. Automation and machines will reduce the objective value (due to lowering the effort needed for the product), while socially-neccessary labour will increase the objective value (due to the additional effort needed for the product), is this correct?\n\nNo this is incorrect. The value of a commodity has nothing to do with how difficult it is to reproduce, or how much physical effort goes into its production. You use the term \"material value\", but this is wrong, because there is nothing material about value. It is purely determined by the SNLT.\n\nAutomation reduces value not because it reduces effort, but because it reduces the SNLT to reproduce the commodity. If productivity doubles, what previously took one hour per unit to produce henceforth only takes 30 minutes. \n\nHowever, it is entirely possible that the effort required by the worker to operate the machine, or to keep up with the increased pace of production, also increases. This does not affect in any way the value of the product. The worker is expendable to the capitalist. \n\nThe price of a commodity does not necessarily increase just because it is more painful, difficult, or dangerous to produce.\n\n>Is there some kind of \"math equation\" that use the three values mentioned above to predict prices, supply, demand, etc? Aka the applied implementation of Marxism, some kind of that.\n\nWell there are no \"three values\", but yes there are \"math equations\" for every aspect of Marx's critique of political economy. There is a very convoluted and old debate among economists on the modelling of prices on the basis of the law of value. If that interests you, I suggest you read Andrew Kliman's *Reclaiming Marx's Capital* (easily findable online).\n\nAlso, a misunderstanding needs to be corrected: The \"implementation of Marxism\" would entail the abolition of such categories as value with the abolition of commodity production itself.\n\nA socialist society would no longer produce commodities, which are defined as a unity of exchange value and use value. It would produce mere use values or goods. The allocation of goods would proceed on the basis of social planning as opposed to the law of value (market exchange). \n\nThere would be no blind or anarchistic interplay between supply and demand. Demand would be determined directly/democratically .i.e by asking the consumer what they actually need. Supply would be determined by available resources and productive capacities, according to democratically and scientifically devised plans. The basis for social planning would be the transformation of all the largest and most essential corporations into public utilities.",

            "body": ">Is use-value essentially the subjective value that is dependant upon the person\n\n\nUse value should not be confused with the utility or usefulness of a commodity. A quantity of product that is to be consumed by some buyer is a use value. A ton of corn for example, is a use value. What is and isn't a use value depends on the wants of buyers on the market, but there is no numerical comparison between different use values (except by reducing them to exchange value). This is a point that marx makes in chapter 1 of capital, which you should read carefully.\u00a0\n\n\n>Objective value\n\n\nDispense with this notion. Commodities do not have an \"objective\" value dependant on the properties of the commodity itself. Both exchange value and use values change depending on the society and history. What you are calling objective value is actually just exchange value. Or, exchange value is numerically equivalent to \"value\" (what marx calls it).\n\n\n\n>What is exchange value exactly?\u00a0\n\n\nIt is the average labour time, direct and indirect, required to make a commodity by average workers under average conditions. You could calculate it as\u00a0\n\n\ntotal employment generated (directly and indirectly) by sector in the time period /Amount of commodity produced in time period by industrial sector\n\n\n>Is there some kind of \"math equation\" that use the three values mentioned above to predict prices, supply, demand, etc?\n\n\nNo. Exchange value on its own is what prices fluctuate around, and the fluctuations are caused by supply and demand. If you want to predict the supply and demand of a commodity, you have to use different math. You should do some research into kantorovich's work on linear programming for this. He developed a method for predicting the number of inputs needed by an economy which soviet planners used.",

                    "body": "Use value is not necessarily subjective. Use value is quality of some product and it realize itself through using. So for example new car has bigger use value then the old car because it can be used for a larger amount of time, but the old car had more use value because it was used and new car wasn't. So if no one had used a new car, it wouldn't realize use value at all, so his price would be lower than his actual ,,value\u201c, which is necessary labor  for it's creation. Bourgeoisie economy often doesn't care about use value and that leads to wasting resources and it can create crisis.\n \nThe case when use value is subjective is art. Because some painting doesn't need much time for it but for most of the people who collect paintings like that picture more than some painting that needs more socially necessary time and it's quality is abstract, because it has no objective use value, we can't measure use of some picture. But it could be said that people like that picture and saw it made it's use value.",
