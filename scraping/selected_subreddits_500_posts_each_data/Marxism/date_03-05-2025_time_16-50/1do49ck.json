What theory works most accurately in a dialectical and material manner that I can read up on? I am still interested in reading what others, such as the idealists, but obviously particularly a Marxist understanding.",

In a social/revolutionary sense, we see how the imposition of 24 hour time upon the peasant populations of Europe played a crucial role in the changing of social forms and the subjugation to Capitalism. This is also why for example many revolutions began with destroying the means of time keeping.\n\nYou can also talk about time in a grand sense. Marxism is concerned with understanding civilizational realities. Different civilizations have had different understandings of history. Historiography is a part of a sense of time, how one understands what came before them, and what is in store in their future. This is especially important for understanding pre-modern thinking because the reason for Marx identifying history as the history of private property relates to why we objectively observe historical progress.\n\nThirdly but not finally I think you can talk about causality. Marx and Engels initially understood that it would be the most developed countries where the revolution would first occur. Why has this not been the case? When we consider Communism emerging in developing, peripheral countries like Russia, we have to consider how these countries who are \u201cin the past\u201d objectively speaking seem to almost leap frog over some stage in development to achieve communism. Then communism is not merely the next development but actually is something that creates its own conditions.\n\nFourthly, when we speak about \u201cscience\u201d in the practical, Western sense, where models and theories are used and deployed for their utility, we come up against concepts like the speed of light and the planck unit of time. I would be very interested in reading a Marxist understanding of the bounds of the universe. What does it mean that nothing can go beyond the speed of light, or that no instant can be shorter than a planck second? These models will serve their use to us until we exhaust them completely, and I think we\u2019re just beginning to really understand what we know\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to tali about. Too many Marxists are however laser focused on political exonomy and fail to grasp how Marx and Engels were willing to not only consider many different  scientific disciplines in their own learning but also contributed to them as well.",

Nor do I think it's \"purely intellectual\" or just for academics to want to understand the natural world around us, it is in fact deeply human. You also strawman me with the use of the word \"obsessed\". Where did you get that from? It's a very judgemental, unhelpful and dismissive word. Your response is akin to that of religious types who feel we shouldn't waste our time understanding the natural world, that it's somehow not our concern.",

Scientific socialism refers to an evidence based, dialectic and historical materialist approach to political change. It has nothing to do with broader natural sciences. \n\nDialectics is a framework for analysis, marx\u2019 addition was to ground it in materialism and history as opposed to Hegel\u2019s mythology. It\u2019s about analysing social forces through this framework to make sense of them as part of an ongoing historical process. \n\nEngels tried to apply dialectics to the natural sciences and failed pretty miserably to be honest. I don\u2019t fully understand it as I\u2019m not a physicist or chemist and have about a first year uni understanding of both topics but my comrades in such fields consider it to be nonsense. Marxist dialectics applies as a framework to human, social constructs and how it interacts with the world. It\u2019s not something that exists outside of the social being. The closest you can find to this topic is Marxist ecology, which is still very much about the social and is useless without humans in the picture. \n\nActually I feel like you uphold Marxism as a blueprint to understand every single thing, from the historical importance of the revolutionary working class to why saplings grow into trees, shed leaves and die. Which is exactly what religion preaches. Marxism is a blueprint for history, anthropology, economics and activism. It\u2019s complete vulgar materialism to suggest it is mechanistic like the natural sciences are. I\u2019m actively hostile to the idea because it\u2019s vulgar materialism, which is a departure from Marxism. I also just think it\u2019s silly. Go study physics or philosophy if you\u2019re interested in this. I\u2019m going to focus on building a working class movement to end capitalism, which is the Marxist project.",

The social being of humans is by essence defined by its ability to labour - to transform the natural world. Nothing I have said contradicts this. Marxist ecology is about understanding the relationship of capitalism to the ecology and more simply resource extraction - and suggesting alternatives in communism based on not reaping the natural world and our future. \n\nThe utopians argued about man the idealist concept independent of their material conditions. They focused on the mind and not about how humans actually interact with the world through their labour and the social constructs built around it (think capitalist base and superstructure). But labour, ideology and material conditions are inherently socially defined and cannot be understood without this. \n\nSo no. Vulgar materialism is something marx argued against as he centred not mechanistic philosophy but the social nature of labour analysed as a historical process through its contradictions and relation to the material. The mechanistic view is highly rigid and tends towards just saying Marxism is inevitable without the actions of actual people. As well as frankly strange questions like this one that see Marxism as something it is not.",
