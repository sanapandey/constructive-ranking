    "selftext": "Communism is the result of the proletariat asserting themselves as a class and creating a class dictatorship that then abolishes class antagonisms entirely. Capitalism is the result of the bourgeoisie establishing their own class dictatorship. What would a dictatorship of the peasants look like? And why were they not able to assert their will as a class prior to the 20th century revolutions (which still ended with the dismantlement of the peasantry in the USSR and China)?",

The security of a family unit of the peasantry is directly proportional to the amount of land they have which will make competition a problem and those contradictions will make the dictatorship of the peasantry less than a peasant based society",

They govern through traditional landholding laws. Property was inhereted to the oldest child and the rest of the children would either work the land with the eldest in charge or they would inherent \"judge\" positions which would settle land disputes. over time the children of these judges inhereted the positions and recreated some of the dynamics of feudalism. \n\nWestern European peasants were unable to fully assert themselves because their struggles always resulted in the devolution of the land into small plots with a goal of relatively self-sufficient production. As a result, their victorious coming together could only result in their separation (and thus the breaking of their power) as soon as they won.",

Largely due to their petit bourgeoise character they just became another class society stratified by wealth, with wealthier peasants becoming a sort of new bourgeoise or landlord. Peasants don\u2019t have a historic drive to abolish capitalism and oppression as opposed to the working class that does. They are an army of individuals due to the way production and thus their social being is organised. They recreate the antagonisms of class society",

            "body": "One core issue is the peasantry is seldom able to produce loyal intelligentsia. The peasant intelligentsia rapidly rises through social class and becomes captured and integrated with the bourgeoisie. But, only the intelligentsia is competent enough to actually govern since the rest are uneducated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Stalin resolved this to an extent by really making sure the new generation was raised with socialist ideals. But even still, many of the wealthy intelligentsia he trained fled for greener pastures. It's a huge problem with the whole model. How do you control smart people who seek to better their own standing? And if you reward them well, they produce and reinforce their own special class. If you don't, they capture your government and improve their standing that way.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I believe this is what causes the downfall most of the time. Smart, educated people seek to improve their lot in life and capture the government or try to control aspects of business, leading to antagonistic relationships with the rest of the working class.\n\n\nThis happens constantly in all societies. You see it happening here in America when you see working class folks go to Yale or Harvard or some place, get advanced degrees, and come out bourgeoisie snobs. It's amazing to watch the transformation in real time. The moment they rise in social class, their interests fundamentally shift. In socialist societies, they will seek to attain high positions and status in the government. In capitalist societies, they seek to become powerful and influential in academia or industry, and in either case, their fundamental interests change to become antagonistic to the working class, even when they came from there.",
