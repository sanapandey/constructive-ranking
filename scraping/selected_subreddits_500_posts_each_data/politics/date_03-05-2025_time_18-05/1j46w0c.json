Denazification after WW2 largely failed, and a decent (but hard to put a number to) chunk of Germans remained in denial/unrepentant/sympathetic to Nazis for decades postwar. There was a cultural shift in the... 60s, I believe it was, but from what I recall that was mostly because of younger people with a different perspective coming about rather than people changing their minds.\n\nThere's a very good chance many if not most of the adults who support Trump and what he stands for will do so for the rest of their lives. And we will likely deal with people swept away in the narratives/lies/disinformation long after them, unless we actually address the forces that pushed the right in this direction to begin with and do so consistently for.... probably decades.",

They're so quick to blame Biden and Democrats for everything, but they still can't admit it was Trump and the Republicans that led them to this place. I don't get it. I know it's not pleasant to eat crow and admit you were wrong, but you would think if someone screws you over this way, you would want them to pay for it.",

Old school journalism. The New Yorker is the same. And so is NYT. You can and should call out some of the sane-washing they\u2019ve undertaken in the last two years (it\u2019s a very real concern), but there is no other paper in the country that garners more references and feedback simply because it adheres to traditional journalistic standards. It\u2019s the closest thing we have to a public fact-checking system in this country. They get something wrong? They retract or correct it. There\u2019s simply no comparison. It\u2019s how they make their revenue, and it\u2019s how they stay at the top.\n\nHow many times do you hear a news reader on virtually any cable news network say \u201cAccording to reporting from the New York Times\u201d versus, say, \u201cAccording to reporting from Fox News\u201d? Or from CNN? Or USA Today? The reason is that NYT has a ton of reporting resources cultivated over decades. It protects them, respects them, and uses them as fairly and accurately as possible in an era riddled with misinformation and outright attacks on the media - mostly from the right. It\u2019s the weather service of news networks. Something out there needs to be reliable enough for every other media outlet to bounce a day\u2019s worth of coverage off. \n\nLong story short, almost everyone drafts off of NYT for a reason.",

The lion's share of their income, like some 70%+, comes from selling stories to other outlets like your local newspaper or so Fox/CNN/Whoever doesn't have to maintain teams of reporters all over the world. Because so much less revenue is tied to ads, these two have the biggest incentive for neutral reporting and the least incentive for sensationalizing.\n* ProPublica - They do fantastic investigative journalism and rely on reader donations to stay going. These are the people who did the big story on PPP loan fraud and how big businesses were getting them when they didn't need it.\n* Christian Science Monitor - Despite the name this is a secular paper. Mostly. They put a single bible verse in each issue, but I can live with that. Otherwise, they have a long history of fantastic reporting, are a non-profit, and they frame stories around common values such as compassion, cooperation, trust, etc.",

I called my district rep urging him to vote against termination of the Dept of Education and received a cookie-cutter letter that did not address my concerns and basically said he's going to do whatever Trump wants because Trump knows what's best for the nation, including MS. They're continually trying to push a school voucher program that will funnel what little public money we have for schools (the worst in the nation) into private companies whose quality of education is somehow lower than our public schools - but they push Bible classes. People are still super proud of Tate Reeves for standing up to the \"radical left\" and don't really care he helped and covered for Brett Favre when he was caught stealing millions of dollars of TANF money. And Tate is still rejecting medicaid expansion so the quality of healthcare is so bad you have to go out of state for emergency care. I have had family and friends have to leave the state for medical emergencies because nowhere in the state will handle it. And the state of mental healthcare here is catastrophic. Jackson, MS only recently had clean drinkable water and there's a fight between the state and the city where the state wants to take over services and law enforcement. Our district maps are going to be re-written soon to increase gerrymandering to give Republicans even more of an advantage in elections. Eggs are reaching $7 a dozen here and groceries continue to go up.\n\nIt's sort of a shitshow right now. You know, a conservative utopia.",

These policies are designed to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society.[23][24][25][26] Additionally, the neoliberal project is oriented towards the establishment of institutions and is inherently political in nature, extending beyond mere economic considerations.[27]",

Most honeymoon periods last at least several months per the numbers you showed for Biden. \n\nJust wait until the economy starts really crashing (it's already beginning), and prices shoot up from his tariffs, all while his party tries to cut what little assistance Americans have to cut taxes for billionaires that are already paying less than the bottom 90%, thanks to his first tax cuts.

That's a special kind of useless. \n\nAnyway, here is the [CBS poll information](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-speech-joint-address-congress-poll-2025/), and as I suspected from such a massive approval number, of the 1207 people surveyed *the audience was 51% self-identified republicans, 27% self-identified independents, 20% self-identified Democrats and 2% \"not sure\".* The approval of the viewing audience is basically a reflection of who wanted to sit through 1 hour and 40 minutes of Trump. \n\nProviding the approval for the speech without proper context next to overall approval/disapproval is incredibly unhelpful and falsely equates the two.\n\nAlso, has a live person ever looked so embalmed?",

Because you seem to be having a lot of trouble here with the concept of net approval (that and the supporting Trump part). I'm sorry but anyone who encountered any polling before would immediately know what negative approval means and not think there are negative people. \n\nSeriously why do people like you waste so much time criticizing headlines which are just abbreviated summaries put in as few of words as possible and should never be a substitute for reading the article? If anyone was actually confused about what negative approval actually meant (which I don't think anyone but you are confused about), they can simply read further.",
