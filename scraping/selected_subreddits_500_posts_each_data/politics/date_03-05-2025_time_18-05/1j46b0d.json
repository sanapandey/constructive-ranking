Its not just the right thing to do its the only hope. all the ex presidents should make a statement saying this is illegal etc.",

As the saying goes: \u201cHell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u201d. Well, one could also see it as: \u201cHell hath no fury like a MAGA voter scorned\u201d.*\n\nSadly and pathetically, I think their anger will out-do Democrats and how Democrats behave when they are angry. **I could be wrong, though, and just how I feel today.....**",
