                            "body": "I remember reading about a survey on rich people that had a question like: \"How much more wealth would you need to feel financially secure?\" with the most common response being \"If I had 25% more net worth, I would feel financially secure.\" (\"I feel financially secure\" was an option for what it's worth). The interesting thing was that people with 25%, 50%, 100%, 200% etc. more wealth than others were still giving that same response. They all felt like they didn't have enough.\n\nUnfortunately I can't find where I first got that statistic, but I can find stuff like [half of millionaires surveyed believe their financial plan needs improvement](https://coregroupusa.com/are-all-millionaires-confident-in-their-financial-plans/) and [two-thirds of millionaires don't consider themselves wealthy](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/one-third-of-american-millionaires-dont-consider-themselves-wealthy-survey-says/).\n\nI'm aware that a million dollars doesn't go nearly as far as it used to even in the 90s and early 2000s, but I still think a lot of rich people are unable to truly feel like enough is enough. Money is a disease and they believe the cure is more money. Forever.\n\nMoney is a cancer.",
