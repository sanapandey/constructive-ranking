Genuinely curious about your thoughts on it. Like, I'm not even counting life experience with actual people, but also people on the internet from all walks of life, from different parts of North America, who all seem to agree on a silent O. \n\nOpposum's come up with a strange regularity on reddit. I'm always surprised when a post comes up with \"what is this thing\" because they're so common where I am, lmao. But the whole Opposum vs Possum always comes up, but I've never seen anyone until you claim that the O is actually pronounced, so this is a very new thought for me. \n\nBut yeah, just wondering about your own thoughts. I've asked my own household, which is a bit of clusterfuck of people, and we all agree that it is pronounced, \"possum\", while also agreeing that opossums and possums are different (though some needed to be educated about possums, I will admit). So this discussion is very enlightening. \n\nAlso: I am kinda drunk. You need not engage with any of this.",
