Then she started spending all of her time with my wife and became \"her cat.\" She even started sleeping on our bed at night, which is something she never used to do because we share the bed with our dog and they can be described as antagonistic buddies most of the time.\n\nOur baby arrived a couple of days ago, and ever since we brought him home today, the kitty has been keeping watch over him - she's giving the baby his space, but she's always nearby and perks up when he coos from his bassinet. It's been a really awesome thing to watch.",

Not on me, just near me. She followed me around the house and would sit just out of reach. \n\nTwo weeks later I found out I was pregnant. The bigger my belly got the more she liked me. After I had the baby she became my Velcro cat. Like now that she knows I can reproduce she just adores me. She sleeps ON me every night. Smacks my phone out of my hand so I will pet her. Makes biscuits on me all the time. \n\nTotal personality shift.",

Seeks out attention, treats, and cuddles; meows at us, doesn\u2019t leave the room when we enter or have guests. He\u2019s a completely different cat now that he doesn\u2019t have to share.",

In my experience with pets (outdoor and indoor cats and dogs, hamsters, parrots etc), often times pets that don't usually get along can get anxious when the other pet is missing or ill/hurt. They are compassionate and intelligent more than they are mean, and suffering is an universal feeling. I like to think buddy cat discovered that you are a better and safer recipient for his/her love and care, once he/she became wiser with age and senior cat was gone",

I leave a pillow there and a gap between me and the arm and it's his favorite spot now when I'm on the couch.
