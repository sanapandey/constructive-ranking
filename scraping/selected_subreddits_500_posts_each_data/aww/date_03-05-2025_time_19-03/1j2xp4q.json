Lasts 3-5 months on my heavy shedder), semi permanent( i haven't used this yet but from my understanding it's just as permanent as permanent dye, it just doesn't look vibrant as long so you are stuck with a pastel version of the color for most of the time).

You get unpredictable coats, and coats that are extremly prone to matting, to the point that their maintenance doubles compared to a well bred purebred, and if neglected can lead to serious pain and injuries. Apart from this, breeding doodles is always unethical, since the whole point of ethical breeding is improving the breed, and preserving it. With doodles, neither is happening. Instead of a well bred purebred poodle, who is predictable, both in needs and temperament, and health too, you usually get a neurotic, unpredictable dog with high chance of health issues (especially when they cross dogs with different size and structure). Hence why shelters are already filling up with them. The whole thing is just a money grab. \nThe guy who created doodles says it was one of the biggest mistake of his life. \n\nTldr: JUST GET A POODLE.",

Putting the risk of harm aside for a second, it would still be unethical because you're imposing your will onto this animal to no benefit for them. Its a completely selfish and superficial thing to do to subject them to this process so you or the owner can be like, \"Look how cute it looks.\" \n\nYouve misrepresentated the risk based on the warnings from several brands so Im curious what you use at work. For example, the Opawz website has explicit warnings that contradict what you're saying. Thats why the dyes have warnings about sensitivities and recommend testing them 48hrs in advance. Do you complete that recommendation? If not, that's also messed up. One of their lightening products contains hydrogen peroxide which would make the dog sick if ingested. Youre allowing an owner to impose that risk of discomfort onto an animal over something purely superficial. And you profit from it? I would recommend never doing that again. \n\nI'm definitely going to continue accepting why it's wrong. And telling others why it is and why even if you could 100% guarantee no harm, which you can't, it would still be an unethical practice because again animals aren't your dolls, your playthings, or your accessories. \n\nBelow is a link to the cautions for some of these products. I've also put them below for you to review.\n\n\nhttps://www.opawz.com/pages/product-instructions#:~:text=The%20product%20contains%20hydrogen%20peroxide,into%20the%20eyes%20and%20mouth.\n\n \nCAUTION\nDo not use on pets that have sensitive, irritated or damaged skin.\nDo not allow the pet to lick.\nDo not contact with eyes and mouth. If it happens, rinse immediately with plenty of water for 15 minutes.\nIf an allergic reaction happens, discontinue use immediately and consult a veterinarian.\n\nCAUTION\nCannot be used for pets that have damaged, inflamed, or sensitive skin. Be especially careful to not let product touch the skin on ears, tail, or spine, keep 1/2 inch (1 cm) away from the roots - these areas secrete more oils and may be prone to develop skin problems if not well maintained. The spine may also be more sensitive due to frequent exposure to high temperatures from the use of clippers. \nAvoid the eyes and mouth. If it happens, rinse immediately with plenty of water for 15 minutes. The product contains hydrogen peroxide, and pets may vomit if swallowed by mistake. Veterinarians often use hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting on pets who swallow by mistake.\nDo not use foil wrap or apply heat. Observe the pet\u2019s reactions during use. If there is scratching or other signs of discomfort, stop using immediately, and rinse with water at about 25\u2103. Excessive water temperature may cause pets to feel discomfort with skin. If using products around the face, covering with plastic wrap is recommended to avoid getting the products into the eyes and mouth.\nDo not apply color dye right after lightening. The suggested interval between lightening and coloring 1-2 weeks. The possible residual grease/oil from lightening will affect the coloring result. This also gives the pet more time to rest.\nNot recommended for use on large areas. Not recommended for use multiple times a year.",

If the haircut is needed because of a medical or wellness reason, you should do that. Dyeing is purely aesthetic and provides no benefit to the dog. \n\nDogs don't always like attention. And not all dogs love all attention. You assuming more attention is always good is also wrong. \n\nIts 100% selfish. And you may actually be hurting the dog if they have a negative reaction to the dye even if it's safe. And even if they have no negative skin reaction, you're forcing them through the dying process unnecessarily so you change someone about them for you. Thats selfish and inconsiderate of the dogs feelings. Not all dogs would like that dying hair process, same with a superficial haircut. If it's not medically necessary, why force them through that? Because you think it's cute? That's very weird.",
