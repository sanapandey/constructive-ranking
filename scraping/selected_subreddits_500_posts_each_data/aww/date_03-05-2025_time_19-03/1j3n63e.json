If the camera is moving or the scenes are constantly changing\u00a0(like in an action movie), my cats wouldn't look at the screen. The sound also plays a role.\n\n\nI've used a video made for cats (https://youtu.be/2jGd-uppqPA?feature=shared) to get their attention to screens (worked on iPad, Smartphone and large TV). Then they got interested in some very colorful cartoons, very rarely some documentaries.\n\n\nBut searching for \"videos for cats\" on YouTube really has some golden samples. My cats are almost addicted to them. They learned (or rather I introduced them) watching TV at around 8 or 9 years old.",
