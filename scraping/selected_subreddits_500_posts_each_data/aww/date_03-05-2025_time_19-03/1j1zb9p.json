At first she loved having a sister. It was the neighbor dog she didn\u2019t have to be on a walk to play with, or my brothers dog who we didn\u2019t have to go out of town to see. Then she wised up that this little lab wasn\u2019t a guest to be played with, she was a competitor for my attention.\n\nThey loved each other, but it was a very bitchy kind of love. Lots of grumbling about who had the best toy or was on the bed first. And while I could get them to play together, if I stopped playing, they would too. So much for starting tug of war and letting them continue on their own.",

We got him from said farmer and so the cat only ever lived with my dogs so he was basically a dog. My MIL and her cat came to live with us, our cat didn't really seem too interested in the cat, but he learned how to meow after about 4 years of being a cat...it was pretty funny. After that, he would just meow for fun, idk why, but he never knew or cared to meow before he met that cat.",

Her first year in life she only lived in a cage in the barn with recesses in a yard cage and living in a house really confused her for awhile but she figured it out. \n\nOddly, despite her breed being known for yapping and living in a barn, she didn't know how to bark. \n\nUntil my husband's aunt visited with her very yappy dog. \n\nNow our 3 year old pom had to show her new talent at EVERYTHING. She found her vocal cords and was pleased as punch. \n\nHer big brother, a shih tzu who never understood that he too was actually a dog, was as unthrilled about this development as everyone else in the house, but decided he should also join in the new found vocal expressionism. \n\nIt was so odd having dogs for years that suddenly learned how to bark. I also held a grudge against the dog that taught them.",
