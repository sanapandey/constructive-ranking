Watching them in the spacecraft with their astronaut suits on, you know\u2026.the heavy, robotic looking all over white suit with the huge helmet that has clear glass in front, was so fascinating because it briefly reinforced my childhood belief that astronauts are just made up fictional characters lol.\n\nWatching them looks like watching a scene straight out of a sci-fi movie. I wonder if they realize to this extent how many people are fascinated by their job! \n\n",
