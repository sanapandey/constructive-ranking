The headline is weird to say the least, because it makes you think that only the far side of the moon was a magma ocean for a longer period of time than the visible one, or that at some point it became a magma ocean and froze back, but then the article talks about the period after its formation, during which both the moon and the earth were magma balls, so is this really news?",

But it's hardly news. \n\nBut I'll give them a pass because at least they called it the \"far side\" instead of the \"dark side.\"",

If something is unseen, you don't know if there's light there or not. \n\nDark meaning unseen is *at best* a poetic device, like saying thoughts are heavy -- only worse because it's not *clear* whether you're being literal or figurative. \n\nCalling it the dark side of the moon *actively* interferes with people's understanding of how the earth and moon work.\n\nEdit: Yes I'm being pedantic, but *not* pointlessly so.  There are lots of people for whom \"tidally locked\" isn't in their everyday vocabulary, and lots of people who think one side of the moon is always in darkness.  For those of us who understand, it's a simple matter to help them out by using \"far\" instead of \"dark.\" \n\nI'm not trying to dunk on anyone and sound superior, I'm trying to convey the importance of communicating scientific facts clearly.  And if you think there's no need in our current society to communicate scientific facts clearly, then I don't know what to tell you.",

The variations in Uranium-Lead isotopes in the far-side samples suggest that the SPA impact affected lunar differentiation (how the Moon\u2019s layers formed), which could help refine models of its evolution. So while the broad idea of a lunar magma ocean isn\u2019t new, this research adds detail and nuance, especially regarding how massive impacts might have influenced the Moon\u2019s interior over billions of years.",

I don't even care if there's a conflict of interest with SpaceX -- at least SpaceX is GETTING THINGS DONE for a change.\n\nAnd getting this in before some radical leftie whines and moans -- yes, SpaceX is blowing up rockets left and right. WE HAVEN'T SENT ROCKETS UP INTO SPACE FOR SO LONG, our tooling + manufacturing are long since gone and our experts are retired/long dead.\n\nWe gave up in the 80s/90s. If you look back in the 50s and 60s, we had to blow up quite a few rockets to refine the Saturn V launch vehicle. All those lessons we learned were forgotten to time. And now we have modern tech which gives us much more with far less....and we have to figure that out too.\n\nWho knows how many rockets China blows up -- their program is shrouded in secrecy. But they haven't stopped developing, and now they're landing on Mars, The Moon, have their own space plane AND private space station. They're the leaders in space, and it's about time we take that back. SpaceX to the rescue because NASA is going to fuckin' get the job done!",

This, like you just stated, is just simple facts.\n\nYou seem to believe Elon Musk will somehow reverse this, which I highly doubt, but hey, good luck with that \ud83d\ude07",
