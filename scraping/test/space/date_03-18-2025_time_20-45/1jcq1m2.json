Landing rocket lower stage the way SpaceX is doing it right now, is one thing - they stage very early into the flight (compared to other orbital rockets), so it's relatively light and has low velocity. Starship trying to land back from orbit is a completely different thing. It's not only much harder, but it might also turn out to not be practical at all - similarly how Space Shuttle turned out to be very expensive to refurbish after landing.\n\nBut I would keep in mind that they could simply ditch the Starship, and just mount a regular upper stage instead and still use what they have as a heavy launcher, making it basically like a scaled-up Falcon 9.",

Just because you have something big doesn't mean you have to *totally stop* having something small.\n\n>  \nthink about why the falcon 9 is being used so much mroe than the falcon heavy\n\nBecause Falcon 9 is mostly used for LEO while Falcon heavy was mostly (with one exception) used for higher orbits (MEO and geosynch orbits). Turns out that most of what Falcon 9 does is get Starlink and other small satellites to LEO. Why use heavy for that? You can bet that if it was cheaper/faster to get Starlink sattelites to LEO with Falcon heavy they would do that instead of using Falcon 9.",

For geostationary transfer orbits the stage is usually just left in that orbit, which typically avoids intersecting with geostationary orbit itself and usually decays naturally over a number of years (but sometimes will take longer than a decade). For lunar transfer orbits the stage is usually \"disposed\" into a heliocentric orbit just after payload separation.\n\nOtherwise you end up having to keep the stage operating for a very long time, not just hours but a significant chunk of a full day or maybe even multiple days. Not only does that run into issues of power longevity but it runs into more thorny problems of thermal management and propellant boiloff and all that. Which also bumps into the issue of if you mess up these things and your stage dies in orbit before it has a chance to passivate itself then the propellants can boil until they rupture the stage and scatter debris across a bunch of very long lived orbits, so generally folks take the safer route of shorter lived stages which dispose and passivate on shorter timescales.\n\nULA has been working on a \"high-endurance\" version of the Centaur upper stage which could continue operating for potentially multiple days, but they have yet to run a test flight. Also, Starship is essentially a very long-lived upper stage as well, as are other propellant depot concepts such as the Blue Moon lunar lander.",

The proper edge of space would be the dawn of the universe, the Big Bang. However, we can't see that far back because the universe wasn't transparent back then. All of the light that existed during the first roughly third of a million years no longer exists, it was absorbed by the dense and opaque plasma that filled the entire universe. We can, however, see the boundary between the period where the universe transitioned from being a hot, glowing, opaque plasma to being a mostly transparent neutral gas. This period, known as the \"epoch of recombination\", marked the beginning of the modern era where light could travel arbitrarily long distances, not just a few meters or a few lightyears but potentially forever, for billions of lightyears. That light that was then freed to travel forever and ever came from everywhere in the universe and travelled in every direction so in every part of the universe there is light from that period of time coming from every direction. Due to the expansion of the universe that light has become increasingly redshifted, from the visible light coming off a 3000 kelvin plasma into infrared light and then even further into microwaves (a kind of radio wave with a wavelength in the millimeter to centimer range. That light is known as the cosmic microwave background or CMB and it is the closest thing we can see in the electromagnetic spectrum to the edge of the universe.",

The only one time where this might have been \"an issue\" was when Cygnus failed to launch ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Orb-3 ) in late 2014, and they had to switch the launcher because Antares was not considered safe any more, and then SpaceX Dragon also failed to launch ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-7 ) with ISS resupply mid 2015. At that time both US resupply crafts were grounded until mid 2016. This prompted change of the cargo for Japanese HTV craft flying later in 2015 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kounotori_5 ).",
