Generally, the apparent size of imaged exoplanets is the result of diffraction.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, JWST's complicated primary mirror and optics result in a complicated pattern of diffracted light that's difficult to explain in these sorts of press releases. So, in this case, the blurring from diffraction was actually corrected using a \"deconvolution\" technique (effectively collecting all the planets' light to individual pixels). Afterwards, this de-blurred image was smoothed for the press release to make the nice clean images with round planet signatures that you see here.\u00a0",

Webb is actually getting the right wavelengths to determine that they have a lot of carbon dioxide in their atmospheres, which is new. The amount of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium tells us that they likely formed through core-accretion, building up a solid core of heavier elements and then gathering gas around that, rather than just directly collapsing a bunch of gas in a proto-planetary disk.",

It's subjective and makes it sound close. Which downplays a monumental achievement. I Just checked, it's not even in the science sections of mainstream news networks. Should be front page. The general public reacts to that along the lines *We got pictures of something nearby, okay? That's great I guess, why didn't they do that before* Overtime that subverts science and is a big part of a reason why so many people distrust scientists. Over more time that evolves into the budget cuts we're seeing happening right now. Oversimplifying, but do you see what I mean? \n\n\nSorry for being pedantic on this part but don't know how else to word it.\nIs 130 ly closer than 100,000 ly? Obviously, yes. That's where it's relative In terms of closeness. Something that's closer, relative to something thats much farther away, does not indicate nor imply the thing that's closer is nearby. It's not relatively nearby In terms of the galaxy at all. I always get shot for statements like this but the reality is 130ly might as well be on the other side of the galaxy. Both are unreachable, which highlights How incredible that picture truly is.",

Or are these just color codings based upon the wavelengths of the light but not necessarily corresponding to what our own eyeballs would see? I haven't seen any commentary on this so just wondering.\n\nThe dark blue planet, if that's what it would actually look like through human eyes, is freaking awesome.",
