    "selftext": "Lately, I've been really struggling with meetings at work. Since I work from home, team meetings feel like the bane of my existence. I tend to zone out and miss important details, and even when I try my hardest to stay focused, everyone\u2019s voices sound like mumbles\u2014like they\u2019re just blabbering.\n\nI also feel like I\u2019m falling behind compared to my teammates. When it\u2019s time for questions, they already have theirs ready, like they can see the whole picture as the meeting goes on. They immediately spot gaps in the requirements and come up with solutions, while I have to rewatch the meeting recordings multiple times just to catch up. I also need to actually start designing before I even notice those gaps and figure out what questions to ask.\n\nI wanted to ask\u2014how do you guys deal with this? It\u2019s really been bothering me, and I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m not good enough.",

I also take my meetings on my phone so that I can move while I listen. Sometimes I play with a fidget toy or draw notes related to what I hear. \nLet your manager know and ask when you are lost in a meeting. You don\u2019t have to have questions. Focusing on what happened and looking at the plan longer is beneficial to the team. That is what the ADHD brain is great at, skipping redundancies. You might not see problems but you might see the same task being done differently. \nI don\u2019t provide value in meetings. Everyone in my company is aware of that. I provide value via email or slack afterwards.",

Standing desk, kneeling desk, fidget toys off camera.\n\nGet evaluated for auditory processing problems if you haven't yet - that's likely the core problem.\n\nThe questions part will likely fall into place if you solve the attention and listening issue. The other people act \"like they can see the whole picture as the meeting goes on\" because - funny choice of metaphor - they have *heard* the whole thing, and you haven't.",

I don\u2019t take anything in if I\u2019m just sat listening in a meeting as I\u2019ll be daydreaming or distracted by anything.\n\nTeam meetings I\u2019m lucky, my manager gives us breaks, we have an agenda but it\u2019s informal in the sense that we change topics and have a laugh too\u2026 I have regular check ins with my manager, and let her know if I\u2019m struggling - sometimes I\u2019ll have a 1:1 after a team meeting to just check I understood everything. \n\nOnline meetings I do the same - take minutes or ask permission to record a transcript and get an AI summary.\nI have captions on to read if I\u2019m not chairing the meeting. \n\nSometimes I put ear buds in to reduce the noise.\n\nI get up and move around - WFH I sit in different places - usually on the sofa in a blanket and pillow nest",
