It\u2019s a big, big word that\u2019s becoming spoken about more with each decade. The fact that people seem to be more willing to talk about it is a wonderful thing because that one word can really affect so many different aspects of a person's life; how they date, their friendships, their parenting styles, and their work life. \n\nThe impact of unprocessed trauma is honestly scary. One thing I don\u2019t often see spoken about is trauma in relation to Autism and ADHD (or AuDHD, if you\u2019re lucky, like me, and got hit with both!).\n",

I'm not sure if reducing the Prozac and adding a stimulant would be more beneficial or not, but at my current med point I feel pretty good. The Prozac alone made me feel almost numb, fatigued, and anehdonic depression(?). Low grade, constant, dull feeling where I didn't feel like the world would end, but I was struggling to see the point of any of it at all.\n\nWith the conbo...Lower energy than I'd prefer, but feel connected with my thoughts and feelings generally, am better at not harshly reacting to perceived criticism (ESCPECIALLY IN THE MORNING*)\n\nMy current frustrations are that I frequently fall through thoughts. Before, I'd feel like I'd be sitting through random thoughts and then suddenly a bad feeling would arise and my brain would HYPERFOCUS hard. I'd be stuck there.\n\nNow it feels more controlled. I can kind of pull myself in and out of those thought patterns which make finding the trigger points and obvious irrationality of my emotions a bit easier to see. Granted, I'm a very introspective person, and tend to pay too much attention to how I feel.\n\nNow, I struggle with feeling like I can't keep attention, and having to repeatedly throw myself in and out of these negative thought patterns is very annoying. I can't just... Not do it still. \n\nIn terms of therapy, I'd like to pursue EDMR and CBT, however I've been having issues with my current therapist so for the past few months, (since Ive been on this combo), I've been rawdogging the journey of figuring myself out.\n\n> Bottom disclaimer: I've also been told guanificine is very solid for RSD symptoms for some, I've considered this medication as well but Wellbutrin REALLY made the difference for me personally.",

I really took a look back and wrote only one and a half page of small traumatic events in my childhood that I can remember 30 years later. I just concluded that if these events were so out of the norm for my very peaceful and uneventful chilhood, if I only remember that... there was no big traumatic events or distorted emotional abuse that could have caused my troubles today. After that conclusion, I changed therapist and hope to be able to get medicated for my ADHD that has nothing to do with trauma.\nI really hope that for people that have ADHD linked to trauma that they can find tools to help. And for those who don't as well, widouth, having therapists jumping to this conclusion.",

I had found a place to work with me, but part of that was sorting out trauma first, and I have that in spades but I had no desire to review things I had to bury for the sake of my sanity. When my therapist laid out the road map for help, I suddenly felt like I didn't want help because I didn't want to dig it all up. Honestly, digging it up was the best thing in the world for me, because it started to produce some of the help I needed.",
