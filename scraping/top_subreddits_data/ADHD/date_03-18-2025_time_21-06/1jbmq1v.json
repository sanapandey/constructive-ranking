The last couple of weeks I was like I shut in, I don\u2018t want to move out of this home where love was felt everywhere. \nOn Monday I hyperfocused on finding a new apartment, ignoring all the lingering emotions. On Thursday I signed the contract and paid with my refund tax. Yesterday I slept my first night in the new Apartment. I try to be proud that I managed everything but I\u2018m torn. Didn\u2018t know that psychologicsl pain can cause physical pain too",

On the bus ride I managed to remember the stop Google suggests is awful and it's the next stop. I proceeded to get a salad on sale, didn't get coffee (I have 2 months supply) I then proceeded to Walmart to look at controllers, they had two and they were way more expensive than I thought they would be. As I go to leave I rendomly see out of the corner of my eye air freshners, specifically essential oils and they had peppermint which I had been looking for for months. I purchased it and get on the return bus. As I'm getting off the bus I remembered there is a large electronics store near me, it was open now and I powered through making the decision to go rather than say no and never go. They had a controller for less than half what I had been thinking and I bought it. Came back to my apartment, got the controller working on my phone, enjoyed a delicious salad and got a little paperwork done to boot. It was a good day.",
