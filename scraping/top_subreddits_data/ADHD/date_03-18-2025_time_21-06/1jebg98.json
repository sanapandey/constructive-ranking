House & my \"Office\" is cluttered. Paperwork is consistently backed up and the TV is both a source of please-no-more-news and help-me-veg.\n\nAny better strategies for rising above this chaos to keep sane?  Thanks, All.",

Something my PCP, therapist, and psychiatrist have all kept telling me to do. I used to work from home which meant I spend all of my free time in my room and you don't realize how much that drains you until you go outside for a little while.
