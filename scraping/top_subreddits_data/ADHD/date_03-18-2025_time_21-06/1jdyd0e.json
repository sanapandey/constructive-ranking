    "selftext": "I\u2019m a psychiatry provider posting on behalf of a friend who runs a clinic in rural Alaska. There\u2019s a new DEA rule proposal that would effectively block telehealth prescribers from prescribing ADHD medications, Testosterone, or any other scheduled medication without first seeing a patient in person. If approved, this rule would go into effect next year.\n\nFor people who live in big cities, this might not seem like a big deal\u2014there are usually providers nearby. But in places like rural Alaska, or any remote part of the country, you might not have a single local provider who\u2019ll prescribe ADHD medications or gender-affirming hormones. My friend\u2019s clinic has served the trans community in Alaska for years, and let me tell you, there are not many other options there. If this rule passes, she\u2019ll have to close her doors.\n\nThe deadline to comment on this DEA proposal is tomorrow, March 18, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. EST. If you care about making healthcare accessible\u2014particularly for ADHD, trans, non-binary, and other marginalized communities (SUD)\u2014please consider letting the DEA know how you feel about this. \n\nYou can submit a comment directly here:\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/commenton/DEA-2023-0029-35465\n\nI\u2019ll be around tonight and tomorrow to answer any questions in the comments.",

A lot of people use online providers because they don't want to have to try to find a local doctor they hope they like, then wait a year to get an appointment, or they don't have insurance and online options are much more cost effective. \n\nAnyone who puts a rule in place that makes it administratively more burdensome for someone with ADHD to get medication tells me they don't even understand ADHD. \n\nI'm curious- will this also affect perimenopausal women getting online access to HRT?",

                            "body": "\u2022\tExplosive Growth and Acceptance: The shift to telehealth has been embraced by both patients and providers on an unprecedented scale. According to McKinsey, telehealth usage skyrocketed from 11% of Americans in 2019 to 46% in 2020 as services moved online (Bestsenny et al., 2021). Providers rapidly expanded virtual offerings, in some cases seeing 50 to 175 times more telehealth patients than before. Even after the initial pandemic peak, telehealth remains deeply woven into mental health services: in 2021, one in three psychiatric visits continued to be conducted via telehealth (Ollove, 2021).\n\nCrucially, telehealth has helped reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment. Many patients have been able to schedule virtual psychiatric evaluations much sooner than they would in-person, and follow-ups have been conducted more efficiently, allowing for rapid medication adjustments (Shigekawa et al., 2018). Especially during the national ADHD medication shortage, telehealth has been an essential tool, allowing patients to navigate pharmacy changes more effectively by keeping in close contact with their providers.\n\nEmbracing Innovation to Expand Access, Not Restrict It\n\nGiven the documented benefits of telehealth, the DEA\u2019s proposal to impose new barriers on telemedicine prescribing is a step in the wrong direction. We should be embracing technology to enhance healthcare accessibility, not retreating from it. Telehealth has become a firmly entrenched component of our healthcare system, and restricting it now would undo years of progress.\n\nInstead of restricting telehealth, the DEA should work collaboratively with healthcare providers, patients, and policymakers to craft guidelines that ensure safety while preserving access. This could include expanded identity verification measures, enhanced monitoring systems, and provider training on best practices for prescribing psychiatric medications remotely\u2014without arbitrarily requiring in-person visits that could leave millions of patients without care.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn light of the evidence and considerations above, I urge the DEA to reconsider and rescind the proposed rule limiting telehealth prescribing for psychiatric medications, including those used to treat depression, anxiety, and ADHD. The critical role of telehealth in connecting patients to care cannot be overstated\u2014it has become an integral part of how we deliver mental health services in the modern era.\n\nAdditionally, this policy would run counter to the efficiency-driven priorities of the Trump administration, which actively expanded telehealth access to improve government efficiency and reduce burdensome regulations. Just as the administration encouraged telework in federal agencies to reduce inefficiencies and modernize workflows, telehealth should continue to be utilized as a cost-effective, patient-centered solution that aligns with broader efforts to streamline government services and improve access to care in rural and underserved areas.\n\nOver 38,000 public comments were submitted on the DEA\u2019s telemedicine rules, reflecting widespread public concern about losing access to telehealth services (Mehrotra et al., 2023). I hope the DEA will heed these voices and the overwhelming evidence that telehealth is a positive force in modern healthcare.\n\nThank you for considering this comment. I trust that the DEA will ultimately choose a path that protects public safety and public health by maintaining access to telehealth-enabled psychiatric care. Our communities\u2014from rural towns to urban centers\u2014are counting on it.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nCited Sources\n\t\u2022\tAndrilla, C. H. A., Patterson, D. G., Garberson, L.

Telehealth is their only option.\n\nThe DEA has specifically said they are determining the cap on ADHD meds based on comments.\n\nThey significantly postponed their last proposal when 38k people commented.

            "body": "TLDR; requires 1 in person visit to be given prescriptions via telehealth. Mental health providers, pediatricians, psychiatrists, palliative/hospice providers and VA are allowed exemption. \nRequires costly special registration fees and administrative burden to providers, particularly smaller providers which constitute a lot of mental health and substance abuse. Many of these psychiatrists and therapists only do telehealth with no in person options. Some don\u2019t even have an office. The cost breakdown didn\u2019t take into account with wages the other costs associated with having a practice, incidentals like equipment, programs, computers, rent, utilities, insurance.\nIt seems fairly reasonable on paper but with the way things are going in this administration and political climate, and the attacks on people with disabilities and color (who typically have greater barriers to access) this could be disastrous. \nThere was discussion about primary care and specialty such as oncology and not being able to physically see the patient and take vitals as a barrier. \nThis could be assisted with providing a kit of vitals equipment for pts utilizing telehealth when appropriate. Provisions and arrangements could also be made for home health providers to have access and equipment for appts to assist with those who lack technology or knowledge of technology as a barrier. \nI agree that some providers need to see pts in person and some visits require it but there are many visits that could be remotely done, and sometimes homebound pts need it for access. \nI don\u2019t see exactly how they will cap\nADHD meds based on this I don\u2019t understand the language of anyone else does or read a reference I didn\u2019t aside from the one company who was illegally prescribing.\nThere have been MANY shortages of adhd meds the past several years and it has impacted my family in a myriad of ways none of them good. Many adults are now getting late diagnoses that they needed years ago and seeking treatment with a decreased stigma in society and increasing awareness of adhd and other mental health issues that may not be blatantly obvious at first glance. Societal changes and increased demands due to technology, insurance companies etc have increased the burden on individuals with adhd to perform many more tasks that are difficult for executive function. \nIt\u2019s a complicated issue and while I definitely want there to be accountability for potentially addictive drugs and diversion, I believe that the rate of these issues are less impactful than they believe taking out the fraudulent practices that occurred. \nThere is real concern by the disabled community about the language and policies around people with disabilities and this could be used as a way to further limit access and increase complications and adverse outcomes for pts. Tragic events make headlines and furthers the ability to control the narrative about the dangers of mental health illnesses and the people who have them. We need MORE access and treatment, not less. We need more research and training for professionals not increasing administrative burden.",

Even for those who do not use it, it reduces strain on limited in-person services and infrastructure during business hours. \n\nTelehealth decreases friction and increases accessibility for folks who work during business hours, have family caretaking obligations that make it difficult or impossible to travel for healthcare, are disabled, are do not have access to reliable transit.\n\nNobody benefits from increased barriers to accessing life-saving medical care.\n\nAnd from a purely economic viewpoint, will have ramifications on the productivity and profits of business who employ employees who use this medication to improve their functioning. \n\nRemoval of telehealth options is a moral, ethical, humanitarian, and economic failing.",
