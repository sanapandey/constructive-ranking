    "selftext": "There are so many conditions that are related to ADHD and once I was old enough to seek my own healthcare I realized just how many things I need treatment for. I didn\u2019t have a great childhood and looking back I am shocked that so much was missed. After I started treatment for my ADHD, it\u2019s like I could finally slow down enough to notice things that I didn\u2019t before. I started to piece together things from my childhood and realized I was also likely autistic. Apparently it was brought up when I was a child but my parents said ADHD was made up as a way to make kids into zombies and that I was \u201ctoo smart\u201d to be autistic. I was literally showing so many symptoms and received treatment/therapy/hospitalizations for multiple of them yet I never got an assessment. Finding resources as an adult is a nightmare and the cost in the US is insane. I was fortunate enough to find a research study that diagnosed me without me with autism without having to pay for it and my PCP was luckily well-versed in ADHD. I am now getting therapy for free as well by utilizing the same place that diagnosed me with autism. Learning to unmask is actually the most insane experience and I am starting to question if I even know myself. It\u2019s like I have spent all my time suppressing myself for others, being embarrassed when I can\u2019t suppress everything, and when I am alone I am so exhausted my brain just shuts off or replays all of my interactions until I enter a shame spiral. I am simultaneously so sad for the kid I was who had it so much harder than they needed to and terrified that future me will have to choose between being bullied for who I am forever or living a life of suppression and burnout.",

I told my therapist yesterday that the more I learn about ADHD, the more it feels like I don't even have a personality and everything is just symptoms. As OP said, It also gives me that feeling of -do I know me at all-.\n\nStill working on how to deal with that. I am trying to reframe it that it still is my personality that I had adapted while also having ADHD. But it just feels weird. I guess it goes away with time?",

They have the opposite of symptoms in that case.\n\nIf you're curious, funny, smart, anxious, energetic, angry, empathetic, creative or anything else, maybe parts of those traits are linked to ADHD. They're still your personality and ADHD did not shape everything you are. Your genes, your education, the people you met, the events you went through, all that mixed to create a personality.\n\nAlso, you have adapted to ADHD for decades without help. It says a lot about your courage and your resilience, which are also parts of your personality.\n\nSo yes ADHD probably shaped who you are. Possibly large parts, because it comes with a lot of effects. But you are still a real person, worthy of love, with flaws  and with qualities. You're not pure ADHD made human.",

She started saying that I can't possibly have ADHD because I can concentrate quite well on the things I like. She even gave a few other similar examples of cases where I was clearly showing ADHD symptoms. In the end, even though I was very much annoyed by her reaction, I couldn't help but laugh in front of her because of all the \"reasons\" she gave. She naturally took offence when I mentioned why I was laughing.\n\nHer thing is always either \"don't focus on your problems so much and try to enjoy life\" or \"do you have a way to fix it?\" whenever I complain about my ADHD, as if I can just flip a switch and fix everything.\n\nNaturally, I barely, if ever, talk with her about ADHD anymore.",

Let's use the fact that we hardly remember our past to shape a better future free of these constraints. Medication has helped me a great deal particularly in becoming sober and achieving personal objectives. \n\nMy current struggle is to be able to live in the present rather than always be in the future, wanting more and more. I'll also be looking for counseling on top of medication.",
