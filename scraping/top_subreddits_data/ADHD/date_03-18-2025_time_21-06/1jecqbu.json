    "selftext": "This is the second job that I've been fired from, for basically the same reasons. I don't have a car, so I rely on public transit and users to get to work, plus it's just hard to get going in the morning. They didn't care, I know they've been looking for a reason to fire me, and they finally found one. I just don't think I'll ever find a job that will work for me. I'm already struggling financially, so I just feel so screwed.",

You are not taking this seriously enough. \n\nIf you think you need to wake up at 6, wake up at 5. If you think you need to leave for work at 8, leave at 7.  The worst that can happen is that you are early which only makes you look responsible. \n\nOur ADHD is a reason but not an excuse. We have to survive, and that means doing things we don't like.",
