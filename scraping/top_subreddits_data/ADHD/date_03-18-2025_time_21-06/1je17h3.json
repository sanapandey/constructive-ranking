    "selftext": "For short context, I was diagnosed with ADHD last year around October, and I was given a prescription of 40 mg ritalin. In truth, only 40 mg did barely anything for me at all, and I wanted to ask my psychiatrist to up my dosage.\n\nUnfortunately, my dad looked up the side effects of the medication and stopped me from taking it. He said a lot of things about how the side effects aren\u2019t worth it, and that I shouldn\u2019t be relying on medication to feel better. I tried to reason with him, but he only got pissed at me and said that the medication was \u201calready making me dependent.\u201d\n\nEven when my psychiatrist tried to explain to him how addiction to the meds can be prevented and that these meds would help me function better, my dad ended up shouting at my psychiatrist and walked out.\n\nLong story short, she isn\u2019t MY psychiatrist anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve been off my meds for months and I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel more lost than ever now.",

Is he substantially easier to anger than your mother?. If this is the case, then it's extra rich coming from him.\n\nIf you can, try reaching out and getting in touch with the psychiatrist. If you are underage, there is unfortunately not much that can be done as your parents can call the shots on your health... but perhaps you could try to make a case for non stimulant medication.",

I've heard about Quelbree from Dr. Tracy Marks on YouTube, and I believe I recall she mentioned you have to try Atomoxetine before your Insurance would cover Quelbree, because it's so new. But here in my country, Atomoxetine is considered \"a new drug\", being available for only about a year now. And I'm about to start on it, after 18 months of Vyvanse, with still a very compromised executive function and crippling anxiety (plus overbubbling L\u00edbido distressing my marriage). It also makes me very talkative, as it might be apparent already lol.   \n\nBest of luck with your insurance, he have public health insurance (SUS, roughly translating to Unified Health System) but most who can also have private insurance for those time sensitive health issues - and for all I've read your insurance is even more mercenary than our private insurance a-hole companies here.",

I struggled so much, developed an autoimmune disorder due to stress and dropped out of college, never fully recovered from the depression I developed during this time.\n\n\nMy brother never even finished high school. They had to transfer him from one middle school to another because he caused so many problems for teachers and students. He failed twice in the first year of high school and got kicked out. He is now in his 20s, with no degree or skill set. He drinks and smokes. He is getting into bigger problems now, he got into several traffic accidents because of speeding, broken many bones, avoided death in the last accident by a miracle.\n\n\nI got back to medication 7 years ago when I was able to afford it due to government help. Then I finished two stem degrees in 5 years as a double major, at top 3 of both programs. My insomnia is gone. I no longer have panic attacks which I used to have since middle school.\n\n\nMy brother continued as he was. My dad regrets his decision so much but he cannot convince my brother to see a therapist, let alone start medication again. He ruined his child's future because he refused to learn about ADHD and how it's treated.\n\n\nAnd my father is whom we got it from. His decades of untreated ADHD caused him so much stress and anger that it destroyed his heart. It works at 30% efficiency now and he takes 8 different meds, one of which is for his stress because he started fainting whenever he got angry.\n\n\nLet your father read this. This is the future he is building with his decision. I hope it gets through to him.",

Not to generalize, but this kind of situation is very common mathematically, because of the high genetic factor of the disorder.   \n\nThat said... If you could manage to sit with your parents and watch [this playlist together ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY&si=K7eZ6iRtzuzOe7dL), it *could* do wonders for your relationship with him and his acceptance of the condition and the medication. Maybe a couple of red flags could push him to seek being diagnosed himself (though sometimes that's more wishful thinking than real possibility, as it happens to be in my dad's case).   \n\nThe above playlist is a 2009 lecture by renowned specialist, a Psychiatrist that devoted almost 50y of his life (his whole career and now some of his leisure time, as he's retired but keeps an [active YouTube channel with up to date news](https://youtube.com/@russellbarkleyphd2023?si=B8cvB8aiM3NjsmTm)). All that he does and say is based on peer reviewed scientific empirical evidence, he is adamant about spreading only what has been tried and tested. He many times disproves concerns about medication safety or addiction potential, as he also disproves the general effectiveness of \"going the natural route only\" or theories about \"how bad parenting is what causes ADHD, not the genes\". To make it even more interesting, he is indeed a splendid orator, very funny and quite cunning, making for a charming and entertaining exposure of the facts and wholesale myth debunking while at it. The playlist is breaking a long presentation into small, digestible chunks, and is directed towards parents with ADHD children. It's my best recommendation for you, though some parents like yours or mine aren't reasonable people and that complicates matters. But the reason they're unreasonable is, basically, because they're just like us. So I wish you the best of luck.   \n\nSorry for the verbose reply, I feel your pain and only got diagnosed and medicated at 42yo because my parents were \"against medication\" and believed ADHD was just \"a lazy person's poor excuse\" and \"a Big Farma plot to hook young people into addiction, for profit\". Tool me severing the ties to finally be able to seek help, for the benefit of my (probably) ADHD kid in the long run.",

Also how hard it hits - it had me in tears a couple of times throughout and by the end at a reply he gave to a parent about how to deal with the stress of parenting someone ADHD. It's still somehow very light to watch, and you don't even have to tell him it will probably be about him, too. It's a video to learn about the condition and how parents can deal with the kids... But in the process he emphasizes ADHD prevalence in the parents and how *fundamental* and demonstrably safe using medication is for us.   \n\nps.: my mom will visit this weekend and it will be the first time I get a chance to try and watch it with her. My parents are 70 now, she's married almost 50y and poor a-hole dad is miserable, friendless, and only hears from 1 out of his 3 children nowadays. Being diagnosed would be life-changing for him - he would get the chance of living a fulfilling 15-20y final years, and finally get some piece of mind after all the suffering and heartbreak he's been through. Unfortunately that will likely never happen, but one can hope. Either way, I need to inform my mother better about the disease, she is unfortunately very ignorant about it and adding that to my no-contact policy with her husband (my dad) this is gradually degrading our relationship. Knowledge is power, and as Dr. Russell says in his lecture, our parents, spouses and ourselves have to become specialists and advocates for the disorder. If I do get a chance to watch it with her, I'll sure drop by to let you know how it went \ud83d\ude09. Heck, maybe even one day you might be able to show your dad this post and its replies, even our little chat here.    \n\nSo, Mr. OP's Dad, if you're reading this... Trust the physician and trust your kid and... You too can be a happier, more fulfilled person. Your kid knows you did what you did in his best interest, but the better informed you get, the better you will be able help your son. And even yourself. I'm a parent, believe me, I know - and I've heard a lot of \"when you have kids, you'll know\". It is true, now I know we go out of our way to do what's best for our kids, no matter what or even who we go against. But I urge you to become an ADHD specialist, too. That's the best way to help your kid thrive as you did... Or as you didn't. Best wishes for you and your family, Mr. Dad - God Bless you all.",

I am Xithbaby, I am 42 years old and was officially diagnosed with adhd 7 weeks ago.\n\nWhen I was 13, I got into trouble with the law and was court ordered to have a mental evaluation. I had to spend two nights in juvenile detention and it was the scariest thing I ever had to deal with. When I was transported to the hospital I was strapped down to a bed for four hours for intake even though I wasn\u2019t showing any signs of being a threat. I was terrified.\n\nOver the course of a week I saw many doctors and had multiple tests done on me. Once they reached a diagnosis i was released to my family. I was not told the outcome of all of these tests. On the drive home I asked  my father what they said and he told me \u201cthey called you a spoiled brat.\u201d And it was never spoke about again.\n\nOver the course of the next 30 years I struggled in every aspect of my life. At 18, I was kicked out of my home and was homeless and self medicated until I was 25 where a man twice my age picked me up and groomed me into being his girlfriend. Every choice I made was bad, I didn\u2019t finish school, I didn\u2019t go to college. I was brushed off by many doctors as having depression or anxiety. \n\nTwo years before my father passed away he truth dumped on me and one of the things he told me was that I was diagnosed with ADHD at that hospital and he regretted not getting me help.\n\nI am 42 years old now, finally diagnosed and being properly medicated and helped. I didn\u2019t get my first real job until I was 32. I will never be able to retire because of this and may not even qualify for social security since I haven\u2019t been working long enough. I have difficulty learning and might never be able to attend college even now. \n\nI mourn the person I might be today if my parents got me help when I was younger. I cry all of the time. I will never be able to make up for the past 30 years and will always be behind in life because my parents didn\u2019t want to help me.\n\nYour child needs help and the benefits of these medications and help far outweighs any side effects. Do not let your child end up like me. I have an 11 year old that is also diagnosed and I am doing everything I can to help her succeed in life. Talk to doctors and ask questions. Don\u2019t let your child slip through cracks.\n\nThank you for reading/listening to my story.",

I think he just didn\u2019t want to deal with the appointments and costs more than anything but told me I wasn\u2019t taking meds anymore. I had been treated for my symptoms for 10 years already at that point. All meds worked but I did try a bunch over the years for the sake of side effects. But at the time adderall was working great for me. \n\nWelp it was like I was dunked back into a fog and there was no arguing with that man. It was awful and I suffered. I still did better in school due to my change of environment and living in the same neighborhood as my friends and that basically confirmed for him that he made the right decision. Having to deal with symptoms all of a sudden made me have to bully myself to initiate tasks, and talk down to myself because it made sense to believe that he was right and if I just tried hard enough I could overcome this\u2026 laziness and airheaded nature (not his words, he didn\u2019t call me those things but it was how I felt about me). And I talked down to myself because *why couldn\u2019t I just be consistent ever no matter how hard I tried???* Realistically I hadn\u2019t developed concrete coping strategies so I was just angry at myself all the time. \n\nWell I got used to this and got an associates degree in a medical field I knew needed people with nothing but pure spite to overcome myself and a dire need to live on my own so I could come out of the closet (ask me about my trauma AMA). Work was a high stress environment and that kept me stimulated. I thrived on life or death situations. And then COVID happened and my job went from stressful to traumatizing overnight. To say I was drowning *and* trapped in my job was an understatement. Well at that point I started to burn out. It turns out you can\u2019t run on adrenaline, coffee, and bullying yourself for 7 years *and* be ok when shit hits the fan. It was like something snapped in me and any level of stress or urgency sent me spiraling instead of urging me into action. Now I only seek peace and chill.\n\nAnd acting in the typical avoidant nature that comes with this stupid disorder I let myself linger in that state of trigger finger PTSD for 4 YEARS. My relationship suffered badly in this time and I think it would have ended lesser commitments. Eventually I finally escaped my work situation and sought therapy, general healthcare, and a psychiatrist. I am doing a lot better now. I learned that I had a lot to say to the therapist that I never would have figured out without her as an unbiased outlet (she also has ADHD)\n\nSooooo what I\u2019m saying is\u2026 you can\u2019t control your dad. But you can urge him to see the opportunity cost of what dealing with symptoms will do to you long term without medication and/or behavioral therapy. Maybe he will agree to the latter option until you are old enough to have control. Please be kind to yourself!",

Every time you and your dad see some man lash out, make a comment that the person is weak minded. Since he believes in this weak minded stuff,  he might agree with you. Get it in his head that rage is something weak minded people do. Then the next time you catch him raging, make a comment carefully that he\u2019s being weak minded. This could equal the playing ground for you because then you can argue that he\u2019s weak minded, and he might be forced to agree with you because for weeks he had been agreeing with you that other angry people are \u201cweak minded.\u201d Since he says that people who don\u2019t do well without meds only do poorly because they are \u201cweak minded,\u201d you can clap back saying that he seems more \u201cweak minded\u201d than you do.

Also Ritalin should show results fairly quickly, so it may not be the right script for you.

I was able to get back on meds when I was 16/17 without my parents knowing, because my psychiatrist was aware of my parents' views on medications. Some countries let minors make their own healthcare decisions if they're deemed to be competent!\n\nIf that's not an option...

But the side effects are far less annoying/difficult than the effects of being untreated. \n\nHe said that he doesn\u2019t want you to be \u201cdependant\u201d on the medication and even got rid of your Psychiatrist when she tried to explain it to him and reassure him. \n\nSounds like he wants you to be dependant on him and the meds were a potential threat to that.",

Another idea but it\u2019s probably not smart, but you could low key hold yourself hostage? Like you know how kids hold their breath until they get what they want? I wouldn\u2019t do that, but your dad seems like the type of person who wouldn\u2019t do anything unless it\u2019s serious. I\u2019d handle this very delicately but maybe mention that unmedicated people off themselves sometimes? If he really hates the side effects, you could argue that the side effects of not being on your meds could lead to death or something. If he\u2019s worried about side effects, anything is better than death. But I\u2019d be very careful with this idea as it could backfire if not done with care",

My doctor then asked why bother seeking a diagnosis when I survived that long already without any help. Fast forward a few years, he retired during the lockdown and not even his hospital notified me. I could have been mad, but it forced me to ask the questions again of a new doctor. When I asked my new doctor, I just let him know that while I appreciate \"surviving\" as long as I did without help, I don't want this anymore and I would like to live out my remaining days in peace. He gave me a prescription for something and gave me the name of a neurologist and a therapy group.   \n  \nI have to take 2 meds, Atomoxetine and Mirtazapine, neither are stimulants. I understand that old school mentality of \"addiction\".  If you can get a calm conversation in, you could mention looking into non-stimulant meds with a new therapist or even the same psychiatrist.",
