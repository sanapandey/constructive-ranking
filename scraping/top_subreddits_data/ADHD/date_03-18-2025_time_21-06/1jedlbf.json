I saw a video where for us, looking at a digital clock makes it easy for us to succumb to time blindness, cuz it shows just the time at that time. \n\n  \nAnalog has the hands and numbers, I don't think I need to explain how to read the time to ya'll, you know how it works. So, it helps us visualize time, therefore, it is a little easier to manage. \n\n  \nI took it a step further, and I like dive style watches.
