    "selftext": "Hey everyone! \n\nThis is my first post in the Wild West of Reddit. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year in my mid-30's. This sub is my go-to spot for trying to understand my symptoms and challenges as told by people who get it. I would really appreciate some feedback on a situation that occurred over the weekend. \n\nI've been in a state of shutdown/meltdown/dysregulation for about 13 months. This last year has been *hell*: struggling to keep up with work responsibilities, damaged friendships, missed business opportunities, unable to initiate tasks, isolation and avoidance, shame, guilt... I'm probably preaching to the choir.\n\nOver the weekend, I attended a family event that wasn't a funeral, for once. There is significant trauma amongst my parent and his siblings that impacted the relationship between myself and my cousins. We're all adults now and we're trying to work on strengthening the family; celebrating an upcoming addition was the perfect opportunity to do so. \n\nI met up with my cousins and had an absolutely lovely time. I laughed, I only cried a little, I *actually socialized*, I unmasked; for the first time in a long while, I felt like Jo again... \n\nI have no clue what happened. Something just *clicked*, like flipping a light switch. It was the human equivalent of a factory reset. The dysregulation is... *gone*, for now anyway. Immediately after returning home from the baby shower, I knocked out two reports that were long overdue in a matter of 20 minutes. \n\nI've done nothing differently other than spending a few hours with my family. Currently, I'm on Wellbutrin XL, Adderall XR 5mg, and Cymbalta for anxiety. I see a therapist regularly.\n\nWho knew a hug from a pregnant cousin or a conversation with an aunt I hadn't seen a while could get me out of a heavy funk? Has anyone else experienced this? Do you use co-regulation as a part of your ongoing maintenance for ADHD? I don't know how long this feeling will last but I'm grateful for the reprieve. ",

            "body": "True connection with others is so healing. It cannot be forced or purchased, and when we are at our worse we think we don\u2019t want it or need it. But then you find yourself feeling \u201cnormal\u201d again when you get out there. It\u2019s so beautiful and one of the absolute best parts of being human.\n\nAll to say YES I relate! I\u2019m an extrovert who needs downtime and I forget my extroversion when I\u2019m down. I got diagnosed with ADHD, my father passed away, and I changed my drinking dramatically all in a 6 month timeframe and I am still not 100% myself yet (it\u2019s been 3 years) but every time I get out and connect with my people, I get a little bit closer again. The weight lifts. Everything doesn\u2019t feel like an attack on my peace.\n\nGlad you got out OP!",

Friend of mine coined a term we use lovingly to describe this \"low capacity extrovert\" lol. \n\nCurrently off work adjusting to new medications... Completely went through a cycle of meds starting to help, but I was tucked away at home and didn't want to go out. It was so polarizing in my brain and I felt so dysregulated. Thankfully, we had the most beautiful warm front a week and a half ago breaking the winter cycle that forced me outside - got some sun, chatted with some neighbors I'm close with... it was like a new day.",

Sounds like you got the bossy you needed.\n\nI've been finding things hard for a while now and waiting for something to kick me out of it. It just happens sometimes that you'll snap out of it but I've not been taking medication for a long time and maybe I need to get back on it.\n\nReally enjoyed reading, anyway. Gives me hope!",
