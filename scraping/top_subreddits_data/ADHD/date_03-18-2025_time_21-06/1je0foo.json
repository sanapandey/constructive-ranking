What\u2019s the solution ? ",

I just kept hitting walls... then wouldn't do anything like extreme depression. \n\nUnderstand, my life is far from \"perfect\" or \"great\". The times I was hitting these walls and overwhelmed at the simplest task I've done 10 thousand times. Life was good, bills paid, savings, good relationship, exercising, eating healthy, zero drugs, occasional drink beer only. Everyday I felt like I had a gun to my head but would tell no one. I'd push and push not understanding and break/quit. Now same job, with meds. Omfg, I feel horrified like I've been a psychopath my entire life. Job doesn't even drift in my mind anymore. It's just part of the process, what needs to get done? no worries I'm on it. Time to go home? Saweet, out the door, Hope traffic ain't bad but going anyways.  \n  \nI could write a novel on that above paragraph before meds. It's so nice to slow down and listen, think and then react. Not just panic... panic.... panic over nothing.",

Always more work than I can do. \n\nI do have extra duties from my director that I asked for. Essentially when I started I focused on doing my job very well, when that became less than 40 hours I talked about improvement opportunities and worked to complete those. Then it was that the improvement opportunities became somewhat larger projects and I got to lead those. The job I was hired to do takes maybe 20 hours of my week and the others are all focused on improving my department, helping other departments, and doing professional development training.",

It was amazing, I did pretty much everything: office management, choosing vendors, buying furniture for the office, IT support, business development - an insanly versatile \"office\" role. We kept growing and hiring new team members, and my everyday office life became easier but at the same time increasingly boring. Also, the company was struggling due to poor management and lack of clear direction and strategy. \n\nAt a certain point, i realised that i became almost lethargic, sitting for 8 hours in front of the screen while working on poorly defined tasks with vague deadlines, and all felt like a complete waste of time. So after some 3 years, I resigned and switched to a completely different role. \n\nSince then, for the last 1.5 years in this new role, I've been literally working my guts off. It's very demanding, versatile, and requires constant learning. While I need to set boundaries for my employer AND myself to make sure I don't overwork myself to death, I will never go back to a typical office role!",
