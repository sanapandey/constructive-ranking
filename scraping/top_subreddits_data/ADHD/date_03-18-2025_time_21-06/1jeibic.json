Cleaning, organizing, hobbies, etc. but I feel like after like 4pm, I have nothing left in me. I just wanna rot on my couch. So if I don\u2019t get what I need done by then, it doesn\u2019t get done. And honestly I could/should do stuff all day but I just have no motivation. ",

Yes, I feel like I could be doing something more, but it doesn't mean that its a bad thing that I haven't\\*.  \nTo put simple, you have to reasonably believe that its okay. Even if its a cycle thats been going on for a while, don't guilt yourself. Remind yourself about that you got out of bed and acknowledge the things that you did do!\n\nIt takes a while, but you're learning about yourself. You're learning how you function as a person, and figuring out how to get better at doing or being able to do the things you want.\n\nIt was only 5 months ago I figured out my strategy of waking up early in the morning (at least 7 hours of sleep)  \nI have a problem waking up and randomly thought (What if I wake up, quickly take my meds and fall back asleep with another alarm waking me up 30 min later)  \nI've been doing that every single day without incident, and I got a double victory because I figured out that I can be very productive in the morning, but as soon as I sit down and do anything not productive (Mostly gaming)  \nI will not go back to being productive. Its just too difficult for me to. Instead of fighting it, I accepted that, and its easier for me to just avoid getting distracted when I wake up. So I don't allow myself to get distracted until a specific time of the day.\n\nThe times that I give in and distract myself and I just don't do anything productive though, I shrug it off and try to remember that its ok.  \nIts ok because I can try again, and I still have a chance to. Its ok because I believe its ok, as long as it doesn't actually effect my well being and living situation\\~  \nAnd if I get distracted again tomorrow, or still not as productive, its still ok. The most important thing is discovering more in depth about how your brain and body functions. You'll make it through, you've gotta believe that and try again. Oh! And don't try too hard\\~  \nIf you don't have it in you when you try again at 4PM or haven't figured it out, well you might as well relax and try again tomorrow!  \nYou can think on it as you just allow yourself to relax at the same time. It'll be alright \\~",

Commute to office in traffic. Plan an appointment or errand around a 1 hour lunch break or skip part of break another day to make break hour longer for Dr appt. Pack up, commute home in 5 o clock traffic. Oh and then I've got basically 4 hours before I completely shut down around 10, biologically based on circadian rhythm. \n\nBut my brain has been going 100mph all day, and I'm basically ready for bed by the time I get home, if I don't have to run an errand like grocery store right after work. And then making dinner? And then lunch for the next day? And then basic chores???!!! \n\nYou're not wasting your life. You're just stuck in a society that is so deluded into thinking we should be working all the time and never stop because the machine must go on. Because that rule is dictated by the select few who biologically were gifted brains that could go for the slow sustained burn and build systems that essentially enslave us. \n\nFind a better job that gives you more flexible hours. Or see about contract work and leveraging our unique ability to binge work and get stuff done way way faster than others and be able to move on to the next thing. (I say that in a job market that is NOT post 2029 and most definitely not post 2023 and current. Holy hell.)\n\nGive yourself more grace. Your brain isn't built for the society expected standard of brain function based on circadian rhythms. Square peg in round hole. Learn to shape yourself into a triangle and find a bunch of smaller triangles to fit in, instead of the perfect circle hole.",
