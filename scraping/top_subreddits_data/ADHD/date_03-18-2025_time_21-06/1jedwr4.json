I'll start books with enthusiasm but rarely make it past the first few chapters.\n\nDo others experience this too? How do you manage it if so? Any strategies that have helped?",

I stop feeling obligated to finish books that lose the momentum of engagement.

I find with books I can take out what I put in, and allow my mind to wander without \"missing\" anything. \n\nFor example, I was watching Curb recently and thought about a similar situation I was in to Larry at the time. I just zoned out and missed like 5 mins of the episode. When watching Game of Thrones I would stop to think about the broader actions of a character or what would happen if they did something different, zone out and miss 5 minutes. When I watched Killers of the Flower Moon recently I was annoyed at arbitrary aspects of how it was presented, so I fixated on that for the whole movie and couldn't enjoy it.\n\nIf I'm feeling a bit lazy I can read some easy novel and not put heaps of effort in and not think about it too deep. If I'm feeling more \"active\" I'll get something a bit more dense, some dry non-fiction or particularly verbose fiction and really engage with it. If I pick up The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and decide I cbf  I can just put it down and pick it back up later, I feel awful doing that for movies, not sure why. It is hard to really know what one you're in the mood for, but I think it's a real skill to learn if you're wanting true brain-off relaxation or more \"active\" relaxation, especially for those of us with ADHD. \n\nWith books I can simply... stop reading for 5 minutes and let my mind wander a bit, come back exactly where I left off unless I get distracted or low key forget where I left off (wait haven't I read this part before???)... I can just project a different image in my mind if there's a way I would prefer a character to look or act. I really love books!!",

Something about it doesn't mesh well. It is distracting/boring/stupid/I'm not quite sure but that was a big part of why apparently no book was actually worth reading to me.

I don't like how formal some authors are (fiction or nonfiction) it takes the humanity out of it.  3. I also find the way that some people describe things just kind of piss me off. These authors think more is always best with descriptive words and metaphors.

Like if I read something is \"as white as snow\" one more time, I'll barf. \n\nNow that I can finally do it! If I find a good book AND can convince myself to pick it up, I can read it. I still get distracted and somedays my mind is too busy to read, but it is rewarding to enjoy a book so it is worth it. \n\nI personally find that when I DO want to read, I see it as a \"productive\" task and then become overwhelmed with \"Do I read? I should clean though. I haven't showered yet either, plus I still need to eat.\" Reading never feels important enough, but now whenever I realize I'm doom scrolling, I trrrrrrrrry to replace it (when I feel like it) with a non phone task (like reading!!!)",
