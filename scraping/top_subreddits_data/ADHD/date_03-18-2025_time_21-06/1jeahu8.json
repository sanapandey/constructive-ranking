Do you feel your mental processes shift??

Situations that would normally induce anxiety/stress simply didn\u2019t and they felt like menial tasks that are easy to accomplish.

I started doing more of my hobbies because it didn\u2019t feel like a Herculean effort to start them.\n\nIt didn\u2019t really feel like I was gaining anything but that I was shedding restraints. It still took effort once medicated because I\u2019ve existed most of my life adjusting to ADHD. Being in a constant state of anxiety and stress changes your behavior.

For me, an effective dose is subtle. And the changes in my life are subtle too. \n\nI\u2019m nearly 3 months back on meds right now, and I don\u2019t feel like everything has magically changed. But I am consistently getting feedback from those around me that I seem more focused and purposeful. That I am slowly but surely improving my quality of functioning. That is consistent with how I feel too. I still have had bad days, lost days. But those seem fewer.\n\nI have taken meds before, and have begun again with an eye to the long term, not in order to quick-fix  my current challenges. In my body, 3-6 months seems to be the amount of time needed before I can see a clear trend of symptom improvement.\n\nI started at 30mg of Vyvanse (have a history of taking Adderall XR for about 10 years, followed by 10 years without ADHD meds). I think the 30 was too high to start, for me. I had significant physical symptoms and had to do 3 days on, 2 days off - then I tried again, 3 days on, 2 days off - and within about 2 weeks the physical symptoms had calmed and I was able to take normally. I think if I had started at 20, then upped to 30 the next month, it would have been a little smoother. And I am taking weekly breaks to hopefully reduce tolerance. Either 5/2 or 6/1. I also might try taking a few days off monthly (the last few days of my luteal phase), because I\u2019m pretty low energy then anyway, and I like the idea of giving my body that time to just be low and slow.",

Adderall made my anxiety worse so I switched to Vyvanse. Vyvanse is not only longer lasting but actually helped my anxiety. Only downside so far is that the crash is pretty hard and if I forget to take it one day, then my sleepiness is 2x as bad. Also you can't take it too late in the day or good luck falling asleep but that's with all of the stimulants.\n\nThey won't up your dose for at least 2 weeks. The body needs to adjust to suddenly being zapped with stimulation. So at your next appointment, tell your doctor that you are benefitting from the medication but the difference isn't obvious or prominent. Then they can help you decide whether or not to increase your dose or switch to a different medication.",

It can make me a bit manic and optimistic about what I'm capable of.  So it might cause me to make a lot of progress on the \"wrong\" projects or goals.  \n\nWe still have a lifetime of bad habits to overcome that no medicine can erase.  When I'm medicated I'll recognize some of these habits and be able to correct them but we are still strongly adapted to \"being chaotic\".\n\nFor example, one of my very worst habits is the inability to \"switch levels\" when planning stuff or going through info.  Like if my goal is to \"clean up my inboxes and task list\" it's almost impossible for me to not get caught up in one of those items instead of sorting into the proper bucket for later and moving on.   The medication can even make it more likely to \"get lost\" in this way because I'm feeling confident and creative and WANT to dominate those tasks.
