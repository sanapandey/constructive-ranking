    "selftext": "I think what people struggle understanding the most is that someone with adhd wants to do the thing. They are actually excited and motivated to do the thing. They\u2019ve thought about it a lot and have allotted time to do the thing. They just physically cant do the thing sometimes. All the planning in the world will not help. It just cannot be done right now. I also think that the person with adhd wants to understand why they cant do the thing. They grasp for more understanding of themselves and why they cant do things as simple as throwing away that one particular piece of trash. Self acceptance of the situation, at least in my case, is very important so as to not get to down on yourself when you just cant do the thing. ",

I feel like I have been struggling to do ANY of the things lately\u2026 Life has been a dumpster fire. \ud83d\ude1e I\u2019m trying to stay positive, which can be particularly tough when coming off of a pretty bad psychiatric period. I\u2019m trying to make positive steps and progress\u2026 but sometimes I feel like \u201ctrying \u201c just isn\u2019t enough\u2026 anyhow, thank you for this post- it is very validating. \u2764\ufe0f",
