I've been trying to learn about human nature and how to be more \"street smart\" but I don't get it and I'm not sure how to really explain it better. I'm tired of being so naive. It makes me not want to form relationships with people. I can tell people think I'm dumb and it's a bad feeling.",

As a result i went into a toxic relationship where a i felt like a lot of my \"flaws\" were constantly used against me, but me being naive at that point has essentially normalized how i was being treated and am only learning boundaries at the ripe age of 24.

            "body": "Maybe controversial but I want to disagree with other commenters here who said it's not an ADHD thing but an autism thing. It absolutely is an ADHD thing.\n\nIt comes down to the fact we just process incoming information slowly, but our own thoughts move quickly, (that's what the 'Hyperactivity' refers to).\n\nBecause we have poor emotional regulation, we tend to busy our minds with anticipating where the conversation is going so as to avoid making a social misstep, so we'll be reading their expressions, listening to their words, comprehending the meaning of the words used, thinking up an appropriate way to respond, trying to keep track of the subjects, etc, all at once. That means our brains are just really busy, and so when the other conversationalist sneaks sarcasm in, or makes a witty remark, we respond pretty slowly, because our mind is ten steps ahead on a path of conversation that never materialised. To an outsider, it makes us look really slow, dumb, and naive, because we appeared to accept what was said at face value. The reality is that we're just trying to process and readjust to this new direction. \n\nHaving said all that, there are people with ADHD who may also have had a difficult life and/or difficult childhood, and being in abusive environments means you're much more perceptive to emotional changes in another person. They're forced to stay alert to certain behavioural changes that may lead to danger, so by necessity their brains probably work a bit differently during conversations, so that's possibly why you'll sometimes meet people with ADHD who actually seem really 'quick' in conversations. Not always though, of course, some people might just be good at it.\n\nEdit: tldr: our brains are so busy trying to avoid making a social misstep that we process new/ unexpected information slowly, so we seem dumb because we didn't instantly catch on to what was said.",

Sarcasm doesn't always lead to pranks/joking/playing on someone, but a lot of people use a similar tone and vibes as if they were being sarcastic. Nothing more confusing to the prankster than when they said 'so and so likes you' that 'that person should come to you and say it to your face'.",

I would look to your communities there for support and information on this.\n\nA small bit of it is that, with C-PTSD, our \"warning bells\" are messed up. We may distrust people who are actually safe while trusting people that will use/hurt us. Many of us with C-PTSD did not have a childhood that facilitated learning what healthy relationships, trust, and supportive people are like. There's a lot more to it, but that's a piece of it.\n\nThe good news is that there is therapy, education, and skills that can be used to support you in improving boundaries and improving recognizing what honest/trustworthy/healthy people are like. That's why I think you should look to C-PTSD for this particular issue.",

These predators are always there trying to catch whatever they can.  It\u2019s not personal, you are walking with your guard down so it\u2019s easy to prey on good people like you. Then is the self esteem aspect. Where you hang out with vultures because you deserve that. I don\u2019t know what is your situation or the origin of your trauma or naivety as you put it. Just remember you are a good person so you need to pay attention to red flags. What\u2019s a red flag? Write down the people who lied or take advantage of you. See the list and you will start to see patterns. Manipulative, narcissistic, etc. That\u2019s how you can starting developing a radar.",
