When it came time to take responsibility for my life and handle real-world tasks\u2014things beyond childhood\u2014I felt like everything crashed down on me. I can\u2019t seem to get anything done. I\u2019m constantly stuck, feeling like I have no motivation. I have a lot of interests and hobbies that I want to pursue, but I feel like I can\u2019t even start them. I don\u2019t know how to cope with what feels like a demonic disorder inside my mind.\n\nI feel completely lost. It\u2019s been a huge blow to my mental health, and I\u2019ve developed depression and severe anxiety because of it. I barely do anything with my life and when I try to explain my struggles to people around me, they don\u2019t understand. They have hopes and expectations for me, and every time I think I\u2019m not meeting them, I feel like I\u2019m letting everyone down.\n\nI don\u2019t know where to go from here or what to do. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in a constant cycle of trying and failing, and I can\u2019t seem to break free. Does anyone have advice or experiences with feeling this way? I need help.\n\n(Edit: Thank you all for the helpful responses. Truly appreciate them)",

It's really easy to fall into the trap of constant \"I'm a failure\" thoughts. Thankfully got diagnosed and I'm figuring out the medication, definitely see improvements but it's far from perfect.\n\nIt's a painful condition because it's slow. It slowly creeps on you, builds up, and destroys your life piece by piece. Your daughter is very lucky to have a parent that understands her. Wish both of you lots of luck!",

You are grieving for time wasted chasing something that was never attainable, and you should be allowed to grieve. But at some point I hope you realise that you are full of promise and talent. With the right help in the right parts of your life, you can achieve something different - maybe something even *better* than what you were aiming for before your diagnosis.\n\nWhat's awesome about getting an ADHD diagnosis is that you know *why* life is hard*.* SO now you can turn your gaze to the future, setting goals that are more achievable for someone with a brain as brilliant and infuriating as yours.

It feels endlessly tiring sometimes. I have felt like OP before and I was having the thoughts and struggle that they are, and I had insurance thankfully, and I went  an intensive outpatient therapy program. They were able to make  medication changes quickly, had social workers to help me navigate things, and helped me reframe my brain.
