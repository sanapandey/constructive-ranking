But sometimes the secondary train of thought also reminds me of something, so I end up in a tertiary train of thought. If the person I'm speaking too allows me too much liberty and I'm speaking about something I know a lot or am passionate about there's a good chance I'll completely lose sight of the original line of thought.  \n  \nIt can be a nice phenomenon when properly controlled and when I'm talking to people who are interested in what I have to say, but when that's not the case I'm sure people find it very frustrating lmao",

I get trapped in the \u201cI\u2019ve got time\u201d and then underestimating how long it will actually take me to get there or get ready.\n\nForgetting I need to pee/eat/stand up because I get stuck on something I\u2019m doing.\n\nReligiously filling out a journal/planner/checklist for a few months only to abandon it until I decide it\u2019s too late to start again and just never touching it after that.\n\nHaving things I absolutely WANT to do or know I NEED to do but becoming so paralyzed I don\u2019t do them. Which inevitably leads to guilt and talking down to myself because why can\u2019t I just DO IT!\n\nBeing hungry but not FOR anything.\n\nReading a text, saying I\u2019ll reply later, and then six months have gone by lol.\n\nThinking I need to do something, going to do it, forgetting, and having to go back to the totally unrelated thing I was doing before in order to remember what I thought I needed to do.\n\nWalking into things or accidentally hitting things that have been in the same place for ages. Which ends up leading to bruises that I have no idea where they came from.\n\nNot being able to do something all day before randomly being able to at like 10pm.\n\nHaving major sensory processing issues. Even when I was a kid, I hated socks because the seam on the toes drove me crazy. And if I have a tiny chip on my nail that catches something I feel like I\u2019m going feral. Don\u2019t even get me started on velvet.\n\nBinge eating. Not always because I\u2019m actually bingeing. Often because I just keep eating without realizing it. Or because I get hyperfixated on a particular food.\n\nPutting things off until the last second and then panic finishing it faster than any of my non ADHD friends can believe.\n\nComplete inability to do something if only given oral instructions. If it\u2019s not written down, I will remember the first maybe two steps and then be stuck.\n\nIncapable of remembering long strings of numbers. Let\u2019s say I have to copy my routing number or something. I can maybe do four numbers at a time, and always have to double check I did them right. It\u2019s even worse if there are multiple of the same number in a row. When there are a ton of zeros I have to count how many like five times.\n\nAnd, to give a current example, answering a question that asks for one thing with a list of tons of things. Whoops? lol",

And so many other classic ADHD things like hyper-focusing, struggling to complete tasks that I'm not interested in, procrastinating, being anxious, struggling to tell a story in a concise and sensible way, constantly being late despite trying really hard to be on time, etc., but personally I think the biggest thing that affects me and those around me / the main thing that I struggle with is emotional regulation / feeling emotions very strongly. Especially anger / annoyance. The smallest thing can make me so annoyed and almost ruin my whole fn day. (Example: dropping my keys) One of the biggest things I noticed after starting Vyvanse is that little things that used to annoy me A LOT only annoy me a little. My husband and coworkers have also noticed it. I'm not constantly annoyed at dumb shit anymore. And like of course I still get annoyed or upset sometimes, but not as quickly or strongly as before.",
