There were *so* mant bugs and unfinished features.\n\nI stayed home from school and worked non stop for the first two days. By this time, the artists gave up, and we were three programmers left. The first programmer clocked out at 23:00 the day before the deadline, the other left at 01:30. The game was still not in a playable state, so I stayed up until 06:00 writing the most nonsensical but functional code I've ever written.
