Me too!\n\nAs a woman diagnosed 20 years too late, I became passionate about ADHD research\u2014and I\u2019ve finally developed a study to explore the unique challenges women with ADHD face!!\n\nThis study is designed WITH the ADHD brain in mind- so I\u2019ve made participation engaging + accommodating!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# \ud83d\udea8PARTICIPATE IN THIS SURVEY!\ud83d\udea8\n\n# \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0fWHO?\n\n* Need women ages 18-40\n   * Comparing women WITH ADHD to\u2026\n      * women WITHOUT ADHD (control group)\n      * women SUSPECTING ADHD (but no diagnosis)\n* *If you do* ***not*** *qualify* ***but know someone who does***, **SPREAD THE WORD!**\n\n# \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbbHOW:\n\n\u203c\ufe0f**NOTE**\u203c\ufe0f: This survey works in ***computer browsers***, such as a laptop, computer, etc. but ***NOT on a phone*** (requires physical keyboard)!!\n\n1.

                    "body": "Thank you so much for asking!! This project started as my Honors Thesis, but I became super invested in it and wanted to create something that could actually help women with ADHD. There is a conference in Chicago by the MPA (Midwestern Psychological Association) that I will be presenting at in about a month. I want to get my PhD in Clinical Psychology, and having publications is a large part of getting into a program. Thus, the results are meant to be publicized in a research paper(depending on the significance of my statistical analyses), and I plan on beginning the writing and publishing process after I graduate this May!\n\nAlso, this study has already helped me understand **why** we've been known as the \"silent minority\" by research. There has been a **lot** (this is an understatement) of ADHD research dedicated to studying children, but its impacts in adulthood- especially past \"young-adulthood\"- are not studied frequently. Historically, most ADHD research has centered around males, which is why it is not well-studied in females. When combining these aspects, adult women are one of the least studied groups in ADHD research. This study has helped me understand how to research ADHD in women better, which I will reveal to other researchers through publishing/presenting my findings. Additionally, the reason I want to get my PhD (compared to a PsyD or Master's) is to study how ADHD impacts women, and this study has only made me more passionate about doing so. I hope this answers your questions!! :)",
