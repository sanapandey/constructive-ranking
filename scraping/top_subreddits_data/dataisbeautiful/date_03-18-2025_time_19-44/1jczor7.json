But the thing is, few people have time, money, and/or motivation to visit every national park (especially if we include ones across the world). You have to pick and choose somehow. And I doubt that even the \u201canti-rating\u201d doesn\u2019t do it largely at a popularity contest. Like with other attractions, people visit the famous parks that they have heard of, ones like Yellowstone and Yosemite. \n\nBy making a slightly more detailed rating of each park, rated by people that have visited a lot of parks, people can make it less of a popularity contest. Do they like beauty? Are they like me and enjoy intensity most? Or my friends/family that are super into plants/animals? Or my partner that cares most about access and safety? It can also help uncover hidden gems, ones that are amazing but not visited very much.",

While it should be considered, it should not be the main determinant of the score if the goal is to be useful info for visitors (as I would assume it is). Additionally, many national parks become very limited accessibility in winter. If they all get very low scores because of that, it makes the accessibly information minimally useful.\n\nI do think the scaling is perhaps a bit off. Being 4.5 hours from the nearest notable airport, through pretty rural areas, is worse than median accessibility. It should perhaps be lower than 50. But only if the other less accessible parks are lowered as well, because they seem pretty accurate relative to each other. \n\nFor example, big bend is at 41 (6.5 hours from the airport, even more rural of a drive/destination, and unbearably hot in the summer). Denali at 47 with a 4 hour drive and very limited accessibility in winter (only first 3 miles of the park road is cleared). Katmai at 28 you need to charter a flight or boat, American Samoa at 28, you can take commercial flights to, but is a 10 hour flight from the closest lower 48 airport. These places are definitely harder to get to, but perhaps their ratings can all be lowered.",

So it\u2019s more accessible than I thought.\n\nAs for being only accessible via boat, I realize now you are talking about the backcountry. I see you are from the area so perhaps that is the only park you are familiar with? Just to clarify, most national parks have a backcountry, that is typically only accessible by hours of hiking. Sometimes you can take other methods like a horse, ATV, or even an off roading vehicle. But you definitely can\u2019t visit most areas of most national parks just on roads (plus small amounts of walking), that\u2019s just the norm.\n\nIn case you are curious, I complied a list. I may be missing one or two, but of the 63 parks, roughly about 9 either don\u2019t have a backcountry, or have a very tiny one. Gateway Arch, Hot Springs, Cuyahoga Valley, Indiana Dunes, Dry Tortugas, Acadia, Bryce Canyon, Wind Cave, and Mammoth Cave.\n\nA handful of others have a smaller backcountry, such as Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Theodore Roosevelt, American Samoa and Shenandoah. But by that I mean \u201conly\u201d about 50-75% of the park is backcountry. But for over 40 of the parks, the norm is that you can drive in and see a bit of the park, but to see >80% of it, you need to use other methods. Vouyagers is above average at about 95% backcountry, but that\u2019s by no means a record. Gates of the Arctic is literally 100% backcountry lol.\n\nAnd honestly, the fact you can use a motor boat actually makes it more accessible than the majority of parks that require you to backpack 10+ miles.\n\nSo now that I think about it, it should probably be rated higher than parks like Denali and Big Bend than it currently is.",

It's a great idea.\n\nBookmarked.\n\nAlso small edit to say, don't hesitate to use chatgpt or other tools (wikipedia is already perfect for this, really) to facilitate the process of adding all the (objective) information for the parks. Climate, weather, etc. Of course make sure the info is valid but usually chatgpt is reliable with that stuff.",

I haven't visited many parks but I have the traveling bug in me the last few months (years) and I have a bunch of trips planned (EU mostly, though), so this is of big interest to me.\n\nI looked around for a few minutes and I can't seem to find direct links to the parks. Just the pop-up showing the information on the parks (climate, history, etc.), but on this pop-up it's not possible to see the actual ratings. You can only see that on the park comparison page when you already know the name of the park, or the park ratings page. I assume this is planned, but after adding more parks this would be the priority imho, it's just convenient to have directly. I assume many people will want to check the website just to see how the park they're planning to check out is, not necessarily to compare. \n\nIt's definitely missing a map, glad you're already on that. Trip planner is a fantastic idea too.\n\nAlso, I don't know if that's a big deal for people, but maybe add a section for amenities (broadly - if there are any restaurants on site, gift shops, etc.). Could be nice to add, though absolutely not the point of the parks or website, nor the priority!! \n\nBy the way, the sign-up confirmation link ended up in my spam folder. Not sure how you can fix that on your end but just so you know. Maybe add a warning when people sign up.\n\nThat's all for now after a few minutes checking it, I now have to prepare to go to work. Have fun with the process! As said the base is already solid, just need to add all those details and that takes time anyway. It will grow.",
