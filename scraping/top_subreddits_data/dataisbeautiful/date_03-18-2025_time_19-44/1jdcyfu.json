            "body": "Will admit, it's probably hard to understand this dashboard without some background knowledge on NCAA NET rankings and bracketology, in general.\n\nNET rankings and Quadrants are used to help select teams for the NCAA Tournament.  Each game a team plays is put into a quadrant, where quad 1 is considered the most important.  If you lose a quad 1 game, it won't hurt you much, but losing a quad 4 game is catastrophic to a top team.  On the flip side, winning quad 1 significantly bumps up your NET, while winning quad 4 won't have much impact.\n\nPage one of the report shows all the bracket matchups and compares each team's average opponent NET and Quad.  The intent is to select a game and compare NET/Quad data on the right side.  The widgets on the right plot the selected teams' 1) Wins/Losses on a NET/Quad axis 2) Wins by quadrant 3) All games by quadrant.  An example of how this might be useful is game #23, Vanderbilt v Saint Mary's, where Saint Mary's is the favorite, but Vanderbilt has played opponents with a better NET/Quads, their losses came from higher NET/Quad teams, Vanderbilt has more quad 1 wins, and Vanderbilt has played significantly more quad 1 teams.  I would consider that a strong upset contender.\n\nPage two further breaks down NET/Quad by the selected team. This is intended to look at an individual team.  The bottom section shows every game result, broken into quadrants.  If a matchup from page one seems like a tossup, you could take a closer look at each team on page two.\n\nPage three is a historical track record of tournament seeds, filterable by year, round, team, etc.\n\nPage four is a historical track record by team, same filters as page three.\n\nPage five is a breakdown of number upset by year/round. Same filters as page three.\n\nHope that helps.",
