But it has built 277 GW of solar energy capacity in 2024 alone.\n\nAnd from the news it is now investing heavily into energy storage for the grid.",

If you add up all the real costs such as construction subsidies and other financial assistance such as maintenance costs and disposal costs, 1 kWh of electricity generated by Automar costs an incredible amount. Now everyone always comes along and says \u201eyes, but in winter all electricity price records were broken in Germany, renewable energy is not safe\u201c, which is generally a true problem: If there is no sun, the south of Germany generates hardly any electricity. If there is no wind, northern Germany generates less electricity. However, the problem is not renewable energies, the only missing link to create a stable power grid is a functioning power line between northern and southern Germany, in conjunction with a storage system. Funnily enough, Germany is already in the process of implementing precisely these things. People always pretend that the nuclear phase-out is purely ideological, but they don\u2019t understand that nuclear power is a complete economic disaster and that there are probably reasons why nobody wants to invest in nuclear power any more. But they are all stupid, let 50 new nuclear power plants be built, which with a bit of luck will start generating electricity in 2050, but with their Generation 3 design they will already be so outdated that the next renewals, which will cost billions of euros, will already be due when they are first commissioned. That is the way to go, f those ugly wind turbines!",

People have done the math, and for Germany specifically even if you overbuild your production by 3x (produce on average 3x as much electricity as you use) and had 12 hours of capacity (around 700GWh, the entire world combined has around 50-60GWh right now) you couldn't satisfy your energy needs.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26355-z",

Here they need roughly 11 years for 200GW nuclear, while the add 277GW in Solar this year alone. This is a massiv head start, because you dont see a single watt from the nuclear plant for the next years. With this pace solar can outpace nuclear.\n\nAnd this is also the reason why the baseload argument gets insignificant. If you get \"free energy\" you prefer this, thats why renewables take priority in the power mix. meaning nuclear plants might have to reduce their output because of solar. This also happens on a smaller scale, a lot of people dont included the grid in their calculation. Because local girds can only handle a certain amount of power and if you have a big solar park and a nuclear plant close to each other it might happen more often that the nuclear has to scale down.\n\nand its true you didnt suggest nuclear as baselaod, that was just my own bias, because you hear it so often here, it became an automatic response everytime i read nuclear and baseload, im sorry.",

But they arent standardised across countries, and they vary wildly, due to operational practice, technological ability, varying demand/supply curves over days and months, distribution networks etc. \n\nFor example an old example now, British used to have an insane energy surge caused by ad breaks in a soap opera, caused by 10-20million electric kettles suddenly being turned on, this required every gas power plant to move from 60-100% capacity for about 5minutes, all the dams in the country were opened, and energy was imported from France by undersea cable. This meant that the realistic supply from a gas power plant looked very different in the uk because it was overbuilt to deal with the surge, whereas other countries with a more flat demand curve might run at 80% all day.\n\nEdit: meanwhile, this surge is a less efficient way of drawing power because the steam is no longer as super hot as normal, this decreases the energy efficiency of the plant in both carbon and fuel terms. And while other countries could try to do this, without a certain technological ability has power plants can\u2019t always peak their supply like this, so you can\u2019t apply a standard rate between other countries. Also as a plant ages you don\u2019t see a steady continuous drop in energy generation, the quality of maintenance in a country determines a great amount, so different countries will see the peak, and normal operating output of a power plant decline at very very different rates.",

Wind is the worst since it produces max power when there is minimal power demands. So it effectively provides you nothing of value at all. High demand is 8am~6pm, min demand is ~5am. Which lines up decently with the sun, so it isn't terrible but it isn't ideal (this is best in southern/hot places since AC is a big power suck and used when it is sunny). Power plants that generate on demand, like natural gas have to be used to handle the dips in production from renewables + the variation in demand through the day/season. Or you provide an excess of power via renewables such that much of it is wasted, but you minimize the natgas usage but this is pretty costly.\n\nIn some areas, you'll use all 20% of that solar power. This is where you have a sizable nat gas supply, and small percentages of power come from solar (like 5~10%). In other areas, you'll only use 5% of that solar power since you massively overbuilt it in order to reduce fossil fuel reliance.\n\nThis is why battery power storage at a utility level is such a big deal. It allows you to avoid this weakness by generating power whenever and then saving it for when it is needed. With sufficient battery power, you could run on only solar. But that battery cost would be significant. \n\n(And many would be upset to know that Tesla pretty much dominates this market now. ~12BN/20BN in 2024 is tesla megapacks)",

So you need around 30 years to produce the same amount that the RE produced in 11 years. \n\nYeah that assumes alot, ,like all 200GW come online at once after 10 years, no delays, no increase in solar and that after 11 years no more solar gets installed. But its enough to show the rough scale and the importance of the time scale.",

AI actually found the term for me, showing perhaps why we need more power in the near future. \n\nThis term - capacity factor - seems quite important to keep in mind when discussing energy. We\u2019d need a solar plant with 4-7x higher max output to have equal practical output as nuclear. And also to back it up with batteries at least capable of lasting through the night if not through wintery weather of weeks. \n\nNo wonder nuclear has renewed interest. And I hope your aged nuclear plant gets the upgrades or replacement needed.",

Their oversized influence and their often fascistic ideas about how to run the world. Whether that is in the form of shares of companies in a capitalist system or through control for life of the government in a state capitalist system is kinda irrelevant, as that's just arbitrary labels we put on things.\n\n> HOWEVER, to finish things off, I will say that recently the focus of the CCP has been slightly less on growth of their middle class and more on internal controls.

Move drug addicts into rehabilitation facilities. Start public job programs with competent people. This is what works in China.",

So you need around 30 years to produce the same amount that the RE produced in 11 years. \n\nYeah that assumes alot, ,like all 200GW come online at once after 11 years, no delays, no increase in solar and that after 11 years no more solar gets installed.

To boot, in the 70s there was still serious discussion about whether we'd be heading for an *ice age*; in 2000, climate science was unambiguously established.\n\nEven so, China chose to emit more greenhouse gases in just the past 25 years than the EU *in its entire history* until 1990. And it will do so again, even if it reduced those emissions again at the same pace, which won't happen. China is steadily rising to the top of historical emitters, and together with the US they'll bear the largest responsibility for climate change.\n\n>And I will note that China hasn't reached the peak per capita emissions of the EU, and they are still half as much as what the US is dumping out.\n\nThe climate doesn't care. You treat this as a political problem, but it's a hard, technical problem. You can't stop global warming by shifting blame.\n\nMoreover, in 1945, the EU area and China had approximately the same population. Having a natalist policy is a policy choice that will increase emissions as well. Per capita is not the only relevant metric, because blindly reducing the question to per capita will have the perverse effect of incentivizing states to have more people to claim a larger share of global resources. But those people have needs, and that increases emissions.\n\n>One of the reasons China has a lot of emissions is their manufacturing of the shit we buy, but it doesn't get recorded in these graphs, so we get to keep our hands clean.\nIf we want to include that, the EU is actually still producing more than China is.\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/consumption-co2-per-capita?tab=chart\n\nChina benefits from those exports, that's why they chose to lower their environmental and labour standards and target foreign industries with dumping practices. In the end, it happens on Chinese territory, so it's Chinese law that applies, and only the Chinese can change them. The EU from its part is doing what it can to internalize those emissions by trade, and what [China opposes that](https://carboncredits.com/eus-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-faces-significant-opposition-like-china/).\n\n>Happens all the time. \"Why should Canada lower emissions, we only make up like 2%\" If you don't see it, you just aren't looking.\n\nAnd the answer is the same in both cases: everyone has to do their part instead of making excuses and making things worse, in the case of Canada it's 2%, in the case of China 33%.\n\nAnd Canada is improving, while China is getting worse: 25 years ago Canadian per capita emissions were six times the Chinese, now it's just 1,6 times anymore.\n\nIt's also curious that you keep singling out Western nations for those statistics, while the Middle Eastern states typically have among the highest per capita emissions, and plenty of Western nations *are* doing better.\n\n>\"None of the world's biggest emitters (China, the United States, the European Union, and India) have reduced their emissions enough to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Not a single G20 country has policies in place that are consistent with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global heating to 1.5\u00b0C\"\nFrom where on high do you get to proclaim your greatness? Everyone is doing pretty shit at climate.\n\nMaking the \"they're all the same argument\" is always in favor of the worst offenders. They're definitely not all the same. In the past 25 years, EU per capita emissions dropped from 8,4 to 5,6, while China's rose from 2,9 to 8,4. There's a bloody big difference between missing the target judged by measures so far, and by going in the complete opposite direction.\n\n>6.6 billion people in 2022 were living in developing nations. The world average is a terrible metric because most countries are not developed nations. \n\nYou wanted to be judged by the standards of a developing nation, I'm doing that.\n\n>Reminder again that the USA has over double the per capita emissions of China right now, so they have 4 times the world average.\n\nAnd? I'm not defending the US. With current policies, the US and China are poised to become roughtly equal as contributers to total historical accumulated emissions.\n\n>And of course their emissions have tripled, that about puts them on par with the EU. \n\nThe EU has 2/3 of the per capita emissions of China, which has emitted as much in the past 25 years as the EU *in their entire history* until 1990. So don't come crying about \"getting your fair share\" or \"right to development\". EU achieved far more with far less emissions, and they had to figure out everything as they went.\n\n>Were they supposed to just sit in the corner and not have electricity because you thought they don't deserve it? Like fuck off, the entitlement people have to say that China doesn't deserve to enjoy the lifestyles we've gotten so comfortable with.\n\nSo you think you can blow the world full of coal smoke and subject them to droughts, storms and famines just because you thought you *deserved* more stuff?\n\nThis never was a matter of deserving or not, but a matter of hard planetary limits. Whatever political or cultural nonsense you dream up to justify emitting more is completely irrelevant; only actual emissions are judged.",

They're building loads of coal plants alongside each solar and wind farm so the coal plants can take over when the renewable output is low on dark or windless days.\n\nSometimes wind farms can output just 20% of the energy it output the week before, so even if you built twice as much there would still be a huge shortfall for the whole week. You can store energy in batteries but currently you're only realistically gonna manage a hours worth of battery energy storage anytime soon instead of a full weeks worth. So for now you neeeed to have a fossil fuel plant \"paired\" with each new renewable farm to kick in when the output of the renewable farm dips below say 50% of it's normal average output. You're still cutting emissions by way more than half so its still a great step. Then over time you can overbuild the amount of renewables we need, and add more and more battery storeage, to account for the dips in output so the fossil fuel plant gets turned on less and less over time.\n\nThis way allows a big reduction in carbon emmissions right away and then slowly bite away at the final 50% over the next 2-3 decades. If they, or anyone, doesn't have fossil fuel plants too then we can't even begin to get started with renewables. Even here in the UK we get praised a lot for our quick switch to renewables in the past 15 years but it's not like we dont also have enough fossil fuel, nuclear capacity, and imports, to fully power the country with zero renewables when needed.\n\nSo China building lots of coal plants is fine for now. It's just a shame it's coal instead of gas though. Gas is still a reliable fossil fuel but with much fewer emissions.",

If you ignore that, it also puts strain on the reactor machinery which makes it wear out and be unavailable faster; you could make it happen in one way by shedding steam like every thermal reactor, but then you can't start up quickly again, and it wastes heat. Finally it leads to reactor poisoning and other technuical problems that prevent quick restart, so in practice nuclear power is not suitable for fast reaction.",

Meaning the government or grid operator has to guarantee to take off all the energy the nuclear plant can produce at a set (high) price, even if the market price would be lower. (E.g. the UK's newest nuclear power plant Hinkley Point C has been guaranteed the right to sell its elecitricity at prices that are 50-70% higher than the average market price in 2018-2020.) In practice this means that nuclear plants don't need to care about the current market price and whether there is actually demand for their electricity. Instead they are incentivized to pump out all the electricity they can. Therefore it's *other* sources of electricity that get shut off instead. See e.g. [this random month in Germany in 2021](https://energy-charts.info/charts/power/chart.htm?l=en&c=DE&interval=month&legendItems=my2y8yh&year=2021&stacking=sparkline&month=02), where the gas plants are clearly load-following while the german nuclear output is mostly constant. Even if you zoom in only at [NPPs which are technically capable of load-following](https://energy-charts.info/charts/power/chart.htm?l=en&c=DE&interval=month&legendItems=1xag&year=2021&stacking=sparkline&source=nuclear_unit_eex&month=02), you see they mostly operate at full capacity.",

Compare the output of gas and nuclear [last week](https://energy-charts.info/charts/power/chart.htm?l=en&c=FR&week=11&legendItems=iy2y6&stacking=sparkline). Nuclear hardly dips when demand is low (e.g. the weekend), while gas goes through massive daily/hourly fluctuations. Saying you can run a nuclear power plant as load-following is like saying you can transport people from Paris to Instanbul in a Ferrari 250 GTO. You can do it technically, but it's not very economical compared to moving them with a motor coach. That's why in the grand scheme of things it's not really done. \n\nRegardless, using France as reference doesn't always translate to other countries, because of the unique level of state support the nuclear industry enjoys there. You'd have to change the entire electricity sector and the way electricity production is funded if you'd want to build nuclear plants in e.g. the UK with load-following in mind, you can't just build a load-following-capable nuclear plant and call it a day.",

The question was whether to keep nuclear power plants open, which would have simply required to maintain them. \n\nIt's one thing to not build nuclear, it's another thing to get rid of perfectly good power plants that could have produced a set amount of energy that is now being produced largely by burning fossil fuels.\n\n>Listen, people rightfully judge nuclear waste as a long-term problem. The danger, if something happens, is an immense risk that we don't need to take.\n\nNuclear waste isn't a problem we can't solve. It's a problem we can fix by simply sticking it deep underground. Sure, there are some logistics involved, but definitely doable.\n\nIt's even less of a problem once you realize we have to consider other, very bad and very real problems like frequent [mine spillovers](https://www.1news.co.nz/2025/03/15/zambia-river-dies-overnight-after-acidic-waste-spill-at-china-owned-mine/) that destroy entire environments, air pollution that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths yearly and an incoming climate apocalypse.\n\nNuclear waste probably hasn't even killed anyone. It's 'hypothetical' risk that seems way less serious when you actually ask people who know something about physics or public health. It's not an 'immense' risk. It's a local, quantifiable risk we can manage and contain. \n\nIt's like fearing a papercut while being mauled by a lion. There are plenty of environmental and public health disasters and injustices that are happening under your eyes right now in the world, not to mention plenty of future environmental issues the science is extremely alarmed about. \n\n>I know the reddit nuclear bubble is getting smaller every year.\n\nFunny that you say that when support for nuclear energy has markedly increased in Europe in the last few years.\n\n>Will you join the other side or will you be stuck in the false illusion of unlimited free green energy that nuclear will provide in X years.\n\nI never made that point. I'm aware of the downsides of nuclear and whether a country should build nuclear is situational. Nuclear isn't going to save us.\n\nBut you're assuming I have such an unnuanced opinion because you are projecting. It's quite funny that you're accusing me of being under a \"false illusion of unlimited free green energy\" from nuclear, and then immediately do that exact thing with regards to renewable energy.\n\n>57.6% of Germany's power production is from renewables. (16.8% in 2021). And it shows no sign of stopping. Trust me, I work at the local utilities. The energy storage soon to be build will be immense, because of recent law changes.\n\nDoesn't account for electrification and consumption growth, doesn't mean there aren't still huge variability, storage and grid issues, and doesn't mean Germany isn't exporting its emissions abroad (e.g. China manufacturing all those windmills with coal). But yes, great. This is something to be positive about.\n\nUnfortunately unrelated again. Closing the power plants early cost us a set amount of decarbonated energy which we are inevitably compensating with fossil fuels, whether directly or indirectly. That one decision added a few hundred megatons of carbon to the atmosphere.",

The outcomes of climate change isn't \"we win\" or \"we lose\". It's a spectrum of shitty outcomes of various severity.

The electricity generated by France is pretty low-carbon. But then, a few years ago, much of their fleet was offline due to lack of cooling water. So, they imported a ton of gas power from Germany, while still considering themselves \"low carbon\" ... except that they would have had massive electricity shortages if they had been on their own with their \"low carbon\" infrastructure, and Germany would have had lower CO2 emissions without the exports to France.\n\nAlso, France exports excess nuclear power to Germany. That lowers the cost of nuclear for France, because the costs are mostly fixed costs with nuclear, so the additional demand from Germany when they have low internal demand reduces the cost per kWh produced. That obviously wouldn't work if Germany had a similar fraction of nuclear power, as then France and Germany would have excess nuclear power at mostly the same time and thus neither would have anyone to sell that excess power to.",

(I'm asking in good faith.)\n\n> hint: you'll never see a \"credible plan\" to reach a target in term of gCO2/kWh, but plenty of \"% or renewable\" plans, that tells you everything you need to know about what \"decarbonize electricity\" actually means\n\nYou say that like there's some grand scheme to build a lot of renewables without lowering gCO2/kWh, but those two are very heavily correlated. (With the exception of burning biomass, which is renewable but high in gCO2/kWh.) Carbon intensity in gCO2/kWh has been steadily trending down for the EU [since 1990](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/greenhouse-gas-emission-intensity-of-1). Including for [Denmark and Portugal](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-intensity-electricity?tab=chart&country=PRT~DNK#research-and-writing). \n\nIt's can be somewhat tricky to compare carbon intensity country-to-country because of imports and exports of electricity. E.g. my own country of the Netherlands has relatively high carbon intensity in 2024, but that's in part because we often run natural gas plants for electricity exports to Belgium. Therefore our carbon intensity seems higher while that of Belgium seems artificially low. That's why you need to look at this holistically. The big picture story is that carbon intensity in the EU has been steadily declining since 1990 due to the replacement of coal by less carbon-intensive gas, and of fossil by renewables. Nuclear didn't really contribute to the decline of carbon intensity because it's been in decline itself [since 2004](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-energy-generation?tab=chart&time=1990..latest&country=~OWID_EU27).   \n\nMy viewpoint is that nuclear is great if you already have it. Keep your plants open by all means. But building new nuclear plants is suboptimal to spending that money on solar, wind, storage and grid upgrades. Both in terms of cost efficiency (kWh/$) and in terms of lowering carbon intensity. Many EU countries are already well on their way to achieve carbon intensity comparable to France or Sweden within the next 5 to 10 years.",

Now that I have time to properly answer your comment:\n\na) \u201eradiative\u201c just means \u201eemitting radiation\u201c, no matter why and what kind, while \u201eradioactive\u201c means that the corresponding material emits radiation due to radioactive decay. Strictly speaking, a radioactive material therefore is also radiative, if you want to be nitpicky. \n\nb) I don\u2019t know where you got your numbers from, but due to the world nuclear waste report from 2018, the sum of nuclear waste produced by all European nuclear power plants (not including Russia and Slovakia) until the end of their lifetime, including their demolition after shutdown, will be about 6.6 million cubic meters. A football field is about 110 m long and about 49 m wide. If you dig a 1m deep hole with those dimensions, you get 5390 cubic meters. You will need more than 1200 of those holes. And that\u2019s just for Europe, the rest of the world is not included in this estimation and neither are power plants that are currently being built. \n\nc) I don\u2019t even want to talk about the waste produced by mining radioactive materials.",

Renewables are sometimes difficult to shut off if they're decentralized, but nuclear actually has some marginal operating costs, which most renewables don't. So you shut off nuclear if it comes down to it, if market volatility allows for it.\n\nAs for storing the energy, where that's possible of course you'd do it. But pumped storage hydro is limited in availability by geography. And batteries are only starting to become economically viable - which isn't because batteries are unviable, it's simply that most grids are currently still mostly stabilized by fossil fuels. Fossil fuel power plants are cheap to build but expensive to run, so you can turn them off to act as a fake battery. As those get replaced by even more renewables, you start to get into the region where actual batteries start to look reasonable.\n\nAll of which to say, is that if you need batteries to store excess nuclear juice, you could just as well build a grid to the same overall demand using more renewables and slightly more batteries. And then use the batteries to stabiliize the renewables. Saving you the expensive nuke plants.\n\nAnd if I'm not mistaken, nuclear plants do indeed reduce the need for batteries a little bit: If you slapped a hypothetical battery A to a nuclear plant, and a battery B to the aggregate renewable grid, and both batteries simply smooth the supply out to match the \"duck curve\". Then sometimes there's situations where A is charging and B is discharging, and you could simplify the system. But, in almost all situations, I believe you'd be better off replacing the costly nuclear power plant with cheaper alternatives: Renewables for raw generation, batteries for short term storage, power-to-gas for long term storage.",

Germany instead went the renewable route, which produce 20-60% of demand depending on the time of the year. This number is expected to increase drastically over the coming decades, with the target being 30-100+%.\n\nThis means Germany needs something that provides power whenever renewables dont work. Nuclear is bad at that - even if we still had like 20% nuclear base load like a few decades ago, we'd still have a big gap in the winter (and during certain other days) while overproducing for most of the rest of the year. Some overproduction will be there during the summer anyway, but we wont have the means to store that much power if theres a lot of nuclear to store, too. Not that it matters, building new plants would take like 20-25 years anyway, regulations are extensive.\n\nRealistically, we need something to fill the up to 70% gap short term. Something thats flexible. And thats gas - it doesnt need to come from Russia.\n\nTo be clear: Nuclear is a great option and contrary to some other Germans (mostly on the left for some reason), I dont mind countries going that route.

But plenty of people inflate it massively.\n\nThere is very little actual \"baseline load\" in the sense of \"loads that can not be reduced or interrupted at reasonable cost\". And with the continued electrification, that share becomes ever smaller, because much of the added load is far from \"base load\". Most electric cars, for example, can easily shift their demand by many days.\n\nSo, the demand increases, making it profitable to build more generation capacity, but because the additional demand can easily be matched to generation, this increases the energy available for \"baseline loads\" over-proportionally (like: added solar capacity provides some power on cloudy days, but cars often can avoid charging on cloudy days and instead only create demand on sunny days, so you can use most of the added solar capacity on cloudy days to feed existing \"base loads\").",

Nuclear waste is often reprocessed into other fuel sources.  Separated uranium, typically remains in storage rather than being reprocessed, but re-enrichment has been demonstrated in the UK, Russia, and Netherlands.\n\nThe 1 million years needed for waste to become completely harmless is not something researchers are concerned about, as we keep getting better at recycling the waste products.  As it stands, it's only somewhat helpful in waste management, but it has been getting better.  \n\n>Absolutely not.\n\nYou're actually right here, I may have overstated the point.  However, the cost of implementing these measures to meet base-load demand is still much lower compared to intermittent renewable sources.\n\nAll of my information is coming from OECD Nuclear Energy Administration (NEA) reports.  The System costs of nuclear energy (these are the costs not typically included in LCOE) are lower by an order of magnitude compared to intermittent renewables.\n\n>You keep waffling.\n\nI haven't.  You don't get to judge whether the arguments I made were \"trivial\" (waffling).  I made the arguments because I believed they were important, and explained *why* I am not as concerned as you are about the issue.  \n\nPerhaps if you believe there's only one acceptable view on the issue, what I said might not register to you as relevant.  However, why ask me a question at all, if that's the case?\n\n>No. You're trying to derail the climate change effort.\n\nAgain, have you actually ever read an IPCC report?  They are very very concerned, obviously.  However, the magnitude of the things they are worried about happening are small fries compared to other very serious things that are *currently* happening that cause *far more* death and suffering than any projected consequence of not heeding their warnings and prescriptions to the letter, and those consequences will be felt a 1/4-3/4 of a century hence, when the projected resources we'd have at our disposal, globally, will have increased *seventeen* fold (and that's in 25 years).  \n\nThese things can be handled in a much more cost effective way, and will save more lives.  Climate change is seriously *not* the defining issue of our time.\n\nIt's an issue.  It needs to be addressed.  I just don't give it the same priority as you do after taking stock on all the relevant research from the climate scientists that are ringing the alarm.  \n\n>Efficiency is a meaningless word until you define it.\n\nThe typical nuclear reactor produces 1 GW of electricity.  Based on the capacity factor of nuclear power compared to other sources, you'd need 2 coal or 3-4 renewable plants, each with a 1 GW output to match the production of a single GW nuclear plant.\n\nThat's what I mean by efficiency.  It was the standard use of the word.\n\n>And you failed, because you needed to fudge the numbers to get the outcome you want.\n\nI didn't fudge the numbers.  Those are Japan's actual costs per MWh.  They simply have a lower discount rate.\n\nThe point is, if we target a lower discount rate by ensuring nuclear plant projects are completed in a timely fashion (discount rate and total costs as a result balloon over time, when no revenues are earned during construction), nuclear power is cheaper than the rest.\n\nYou don't need to fudge anything, just finish the projects on time.  As I said, multiple times, the leading culprit for nuclear plant construction cost overruns is the regulatory environment.  Once again, you can access NEA reports on costs for nuclear energy.\n\n>you run a business and just *assume* that you don't need to pay anything for the capital you use, it's easy to be profitable.\n\nNobody said anything about that.  The prospect of earning interest is why any entity lends capital in the first place.  The problem, for the last time, is that construction takes far longer than intended due to regulations, many of which are the equivalent of a law against burning money (read: redundant).  Regulations add fixed costs to construction AND *variable* time costs.\n\nThe goal would be to get the discount rate for new constructions down to 7% at most.  This gives them an LCOE competitive with intermittent renewables, which means, given the lower service costs and greater plant efficiency, makes nuclear better.\n\nGetting them to a lower discount rate doesn't mean giving them lower interest rates.  It's mostly about getting the projects done no later than 40% after the projected completion timeframe.\n\nNuclear plants in Japan and Korea take between 3 and 4 years to complete.  Conversely, in the US, it has taken on average about 21 years.\n\nTypical estimates are at around 5 years.  If plants are finished no later than 7 years after construction starts, there is simply no competition from a price perspective or efficiency perspective with renewables. \n\nIn my view, you are wasting everyone's time with subpar nonsense that does not scale well.  The US Department of Energy likely agrees with this take, as they've been releasing articles on their website for *years* shitting on renewables (and that was before Trump).

They are very very concerned, obviously. However, the magnitude of the things they are worried about happening are small fries compared to other very serious things that are currently happening that cause far more death and suffering than any projected consequence of not heeding their warnings and prescriptions to the letter, and those consequences will be felt a 1/4-3/4 of a century hence, when the projected resources we'd have at our disposal, globally, will have increased seventeen fold (and that's in 25 years).\n\nOther things being worse doesn't make it better, and delaying the solution for climate change does not solve other problems.\n\nThat's just one more reason to get it over with instead of delaying everything for nuclear pet projects.\n\n>Nobody said anything about that. The prospect of earning interest is why any entity lends capital in the first place.

It isn't sour grapes, it's just the economic reality of regulation.  This is well known in Public Choice Economics.\n\n>Renewables have expanded at an exponential rate and are very much taking advantage of the benefits of scaling up and mass production.\n\nThey are surely expanding at an exponential rate, but they aren't scaling much at all.  The reasons why they don't scale is also referenced in the longer \"The Cost of Decarbonization\" report, but it's briefly shown in pretty graphs for politicians that don't like to read in the executive summary.\n\nWhen renewables \"scale\", you need to generate more electricity for *less* effective power yield, because they tend to cannibalize each other.  Economies of scale usually work in the opposite direction.\n\n>Nuclear power was getting subsidized uphill half a century before renewables, and renewables *still* caught up and surpassed them.\n\nRenewables receive 2/3rds of energy subsidies right now.  They are still worse than nuclear, they haven't come close to surpassing them by any metric other than LCOE, which many researchers criticize as a metric as it ignores *very* relevant costs.\n\nThe reason *why* I just told you where I was getting my information is because it's clear to me that you know next to nothing about nuclear energy. You also don't seem to know much about climate change, but you sure are dogmatic about it.\n\nYou need to read, and learn instead of arguing about things you likely don't understand.  The NEA has a massive amount of very good scholarship on the topic.  Yes, it's meant to primarily discuss nuclear.  However, it isn't the World Nuclear Association, which is just a non-profit promoting nuclear.  The OECD is an intergovernmental organization, meant to guide policy.\n\nThey have giants of energy research and economics working with them.  There is a reason why governments have committed to *tripling* nuclear capacity by 2050.  It's because the alternative doesn't work.",

They're affordable, scalable, and can easily be trimmed to match a changing demand.\n\nBut power generation is not just about cost per kWh.\n\nIf you blindly follow the cost per kWh metric, you're left with pure solar and wind farms while your other generation facilities degrade and eventually get shut down.\nWhat happens at 5 PM in the winter, when your solar generation kicks out but everyone's electric ranges are cooking dinner and heat pumps are running to warm their homes? Or on a stagnant dead-heat July afternoon, when all your wind power is idle during peak power consumption? \n\nIn those situations, you need to have enough solar panels to meet your peak demands, and enough wind to meet your peak winter demands. You end up with a *minimum* installed capacity around 200% of your actual demand, which doubles your cost per kWh. That's still without any backup, considering that winter nights aren't always windy, and summertime AC keeps running after the sun goes down in the summer. \n\nThat's where other forms of power generation like hydro and nuclear come in. They stay baseloaded 24/7. They meet 50-60% of your demand during the day, and when demand drops overnight they provide 80-90% of it with wind to trim.\n\nBy baseloading your grid with a power generation facility that isn't weather/sun dependent, you don't need to install wicked amounts of solar power. With a good reliable power mix, you can achieve the best possible *total cost per kWh*.\n\nRemember, it's not about making electricity for as cheap as possible. It's about providing energy security at a reasonable cost.",

They enjoy the employment, fiscal benefits, ability to borrow, political and economical clout that comes with being an exporter, so it's not like they're doing it for our benefit. Moreover, they are the ones deciding about the legislation that governs the production and energy supply, so it's not like we can change that at will either. That's their, and only their, legal competency to change, so it's only their responsibility too.\n\n>Tldr; we spent decades begging them to become capitalists so we could mutually benefit, don\u2019t forget that.\n\nNo, don't pretend it was all imposed on them and they have no choice in the matter. They intentionally designed their trade policy to create this situation, by technology theft, dumping practices to destroy industries elsewhere, and deliberately lowering labour and environmental standards. This is entirely their responsibility. Moreover, policies to address this regulatory imbalance are opposed by them, for example: \n\n[China\u2019s Opposition on CBAM](https://carboncredits.com/eus-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-faces-significant-opposition-like-china/)",

                    "body": "> Without domestic uranium and being fully dependent on uranium imports from foreign countries\n\n- Why having this reasoning for uranium and not for any of the materials needed for renewables that must be imported ? Germany is the 2nd world's biggest steel importer for example, they as reliant onto foreign countries that if they used nuclear power.\n- Uranium can be found in a lot of countries over the world, from all different geopolitical sphere, it's not like a country can use it as a weapon.\n- Uranium is an extremely dense source of power, you don't need much to run a country, and you can store a bunch for years. For example, France has years worth of stock kept hidden, we could live in complete autarcy uranium-wise for a long time.\n- The two points above means that if somehow our biggest source of uranium were unavailable for some reasons, we have years to set up a new trade agreement with other countries, or re-open our own mines.\n\n> and the very expensive disposal of nuclear waste and old reactors\n\nWe're talking about 1-5 billions of euros per plant (a plant having 2 to 4 reactors usually) to dismantle it. And in France, we're building Cig\u00e9o to dispose of our nuclear waste. Cig\u00e9o is estimated to cost between 25 to 100 billions of euros according to various sources (including anti-nuclear ones), spent over the span of 100 years before it is sealed.\n\nThat seems a lot. But let's put that in perspective.\n\nLet's take a french nuclear reactor. It's producing between 890MW to 1500MW depending of which model of reactor it is. Let's take an average of 1000MW of output.\n\nOur reactors, accounting for maintenance and our load balancing strategy, averages 70% of that output, that's the load factor.\n\nA nuclear reactor are rated for 40 years, but may quite easily reach 50 years old before being retired. We're aiming for 60 years of runtime at this point, the life expectancy of a reactor being limited solely by the only non-replaceable part of the reactor : the vessel.\n\nSo, let's take a 1000MW nuclear reactor, with a 70% load factor, running for 50 years : \n\n1000 x 0,7 x 24 x 365 x 50 = 306 600 000 MWh produced, or 306 600 000 000 KWh.\n\nNowadays, I pay my electricity directly to EDF, at 0,19\u20ac per KWh.\n\n306 600 000 000 x 0,19 = 58 254 000 000\n\nThat reactor produced 58,254 billions of euros worth of electricity during its life. Now imagine 56 of these, that's 3,262 trillions of euros worth of electricity produced. \n\nThis is of course not what EDF earned with its nuclear plants. But even accounting for inflation, maintenance and uranium, suddenly, a few dozens, even hundred of billions of euros is really not that much considering the scale we're talking about.",

In Germany's energy mix, the percentage of gas has remained mostly the same, Coal is on its way out and all the renewables made up almost 60% of our energy mix last year. Even looking at the percentages gives a wrong impression, though. In terms of raw energy production, gas is actually down from 94.7 billion kWh in 2020 to 78.4 billion kWh in 2024, even though the percentage shows up 1% higher.

So first we will go to the cheapest energy providers, let's say the wind farmers. They tell us they can provide 40 GW (according to their forecasts) and they would be happy to sell that energy for 10\u20ac/MWh. But we need 100 GW, otherwise the grid will fail, so next we go to the solar farmers and ask them. They tell us they will also be able to sell us 40 GW and their price would be 12\u20ac/MWh. OK nice, but we need 20 GW more or the grid will fail. So if we want to or not we now have to go to gas plant owners and ask them. They say they would be happy to sell us the remaining 20 GW but it will cost us 50\u20ac/MWh.\n\nNow let's say everyone just gets the price they asked for, what do you think will happen on the next day? The wind farmers will be angry because we bought energy from the gas plants for 50\u20ac/MWh but for the exact same energy we only paid 10\u20ac/MWh to them. That's not fair is it? So when we ask the wind farmers on the next day they will tell us their price is now 49\u20ac/MWh, just below the gas plants to make sure we buy from them but as high as possible to maximize their profit. The solar farmers will do the same.\n\nNow this is already pretty much the same as the current system but why does the current system automatically set the highest picked price for everyone instead of doing it like in my example via bidding? Imagine the wind farmers want 49\u20ac/MWh but surprisingly the gas price dropped so gas plant owners now sell for 48\u20ac/MWh. Suddenly the dirty gas energy is cheaper than wind energy because wind farmers placed a risky bet. This would not only lead to climate destruction but also possibly to grid instability.\n\nSo instead a system was created where everyone can bid with their amount of power and a price they would be happy with. Then all the energy demand is filled starting from the cheapest supplier. And wherever the last bit of power is bought to fill the demand THAT is set as the energy price for that hour.\n\nThis accomplishes several goals:\n\n1. If renewables are ever enough to satisfy the demand, they will dictate the price because no gas or coal plant will be asked to generate energy. This will lead to very cheap energy in those hours.\n2. The non-renewable plants are in a price competition because they are not guaranteed to be picked. Only the cheapest plants will be selected according to the price they bid. This means every plant will bid the lowest price they can while staying profitable.\n3. Investors are rewarded for investing in renewable projects early while the price is still mostly set by the expensive power plants and renewables can make big profits.\n\nIn the real world all of this is much more complicated because of subsidies, reserve energy etc. but I think this should help you understand why the merit order model makes sense.

It's not even vaguely close to \"just turning them back on\". I've seen pro-nuclear lobbyists claiming costs of around 20 billion Euros to get 9 reactors back online. And for what? Those few plants would only cover a few percent of the energy needed. That money is much better invested into expanding renewables, modernizing the grid and building forms of energy storage, where possible.\n\nThe energy companies themselves that own(ed) these plants don't even want to get them running again, because it's projected to be too expensive to be worth it.\n\nBuilding new plants is also out of the question, it'd take years and cost tens of billions per plant. Just look at any other recent European nuclear power plant constructions to get an idea. They go way over budget and take ages to get finished. E.g. looking at Hinkley Point C, projected to cost over 50 billion Euros and to start operations sometime between 2029 and 2031. That monstrosity will need huuuuge subsidies to be operated. That's probably gonna be the most expensive energy ever to be produced.\n\nFor comparison, current wind power plants basically pay for themselves within their first year - it's only profits afterwards for the remainder of its lifetime.\n\nI don't know why reddit has such a hard on for nuclear. Maybe it's fine for some countries, but it's simply not needed here.",

Energy output prices of NPP's are calculated on a scale of lifetime (40-70 years) the assumption is that ongoing costs (Labor, Upkeep, renovations) and baseline production roughly stay the same throughout its lifetime. \n\nA massive problem arises when there are reasons to choke output from time to time or ongoing costs rise. \n\nBoth of which is currently happening. \nLabor cost is increasing way faster than expected, Upkeep and renovations get way more expensive with additional safety requirements and be it due to cooling water problems or a negative base market price for electricity, which keeps happening more and more die to net European wide integration and the excess production of renewables, the output prices keep rising and rising, though it only is a fraction of a cent every time one of these things happen it's adding up. \n\nAnd if that wasn't enough. What do you do when the NPP's reach the end of their lifecycle? \n\nBuilding new plants in Europe has shown to be exceptionally difficult. Look at Hinkley Point and Sizewell in the UK, Flamanville in France or Olkiluoto in Finnland. \nAnd it's not like that there are any recent positive examples to add. \nFrance said in 2014 they are planning to add 18 new NPP's for those that will best shit down in the 2030's die to age, not a single one of these has entered advanced planning Stages.  \nSame with Sweden in 2014 the parliament voted in favor of extending nuclear capacity in the swedish energy mix. Nothing has happened since. \n\n>calculate the future costs of blowing shit into the atmosphere with gas\n\nThat's why we need to expand energy and storage infrastructure. Excess production can be used to cover times when the current production isn't sufficient.",
