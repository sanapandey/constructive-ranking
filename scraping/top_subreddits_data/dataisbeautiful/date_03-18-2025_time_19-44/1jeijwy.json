Instead of answering the question of how much crime takes place in Boston, this one answers the question of \"did defund the police actually happen?\" The answer is it didn't. I thought it was also useful to compare across to other high spend departments like the fire department and education. \n\nIn the parsing of the data, education counts anyone who works at a school, using education key words in the department name to segment the data. The fire department and police department are easier to detect. \n\nYou can also see the number of workers at each data point if you use the tool itself. This can be found here: [https://jerrying123.github.io/budgets/boston.html](https://jerrying123.github.io/budgets/boston.html)\n\nData used can be found here: [https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report)\n\n**Tools:**   \nChartJS  \n**Hosted:**  \nGithub Pages",
