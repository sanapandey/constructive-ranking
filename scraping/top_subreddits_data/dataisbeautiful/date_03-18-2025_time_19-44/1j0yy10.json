Also getting the net worth of Congress is a hell of an undertaking. This probably took me about 17 hours.\n\nAnyway, I want to use it to encourage people to contact their representative related to Goldmen's plans to reduce corruption in Congress.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkx8ply9xsne1.jpeg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68575d2781ca3f13025d4d5150692985279ad34b",

The Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, published October 2023\n\nNet worth is difficult to determine for congressmen, but they have to fill out financial disclosure reports. Numbers come from a mix of Quiver Quantitative & Open Secrets (who did the work for me) and the 70+ financial disclosures I downloaded and analyzed from government websites. When doing so, I erred on the low end of net worth.\nAdditionally, data from Open Secrets is largely from 2018.\nI am letting it stand as is. Although there are annual variations within net worth, the fact that the OVERWHELMING majority of Congressmen are worth far more than the people they represent matters. Case in point: Good ol James Justice of WV who was once a billionaire, and lost it. He was a billionaire during his time in Congress. \nOpenSecrets really low-balled a lot of this. I'm not sure if this is because that data was from ~2018 or if it was something else. \n\nNonetheless this is a very conservative representation of who speaks for citizens of the United States.",
