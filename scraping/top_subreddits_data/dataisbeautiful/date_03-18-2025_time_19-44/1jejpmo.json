    "selftext": "I wrote this implementation many years ago, but I feel it didn\u2019t receive the recognition it deserved, especially since it was the first freely available. So, better late than never\u2014I\u2019d like to present it here. It\u2019s an algorithm for computing the Weighted Voronoi Diagram, which extends the classic Voronoi diagram by assigning different influence weights to sites. This helps solve problems in computational geometry, geospatial analysis, and clustering, where sites have varying importance. While my implementation isn\u2019t the most robust, I believe it could still be useful or serve as a starting point for improvements. What do you think?",
