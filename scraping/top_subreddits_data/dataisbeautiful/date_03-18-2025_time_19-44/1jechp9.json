                    "body": "I think it plays a role, but also Poilievre overestimated his appeal and played a very one sided strategy. Too much credit is being given to Trump. \n\nHis whole persona was that he's not Trudeau, and that he'll kill the carbon tax. He never actually tried to connect with people or make them like him because he didn't need to. A lot of people didn't *want* to vote for him, they just didn't want to vote for Trudeau. \n\nUnfortunately for him, Carney also isn't Trudeau, and he's already killed the carbon tax (or at least the major part Poilievre was focusing on). Those two things took 90% of the wind out of the conservative party strategy up to this point. \n\nThe thing is, I can't remember any sound bite of Poilievre in the last year, in any news clip, that isn't one where he is either railing against Trudeau, or railing against the carbon tax. He just has no depth publically that he was willing to show (likely because it's not as average joe friendly as he tries to come off). \n\nNow that there is a real issue at hand, he's been completly silent except for \"we'll I'll deal with that and by golly we'll fight for you\". It rings hollow. Other than that, he still just seems to be bent on likening Carney to Trudeau instead of actually trying to get people to invest in and trust him.\n\nEven in the absence of Trump I don't think Poilievre's lead would have held once the Liberal leadership changed. It may not have gone as far as it currently has, but I think he would have lost his majority.",

Now he's saying he'll remove the industrial carbon tax as well, which honestly I think will backfire since it gives an avenue for others to claim he's in the pocket of large corporations and big oil. Danielle Smith is doing the same. \n\nHis only angle is to just try and stir up resentment. Not once has he instead shifted focus to leading.",

So even if Trump\u2019s election didn\u2019t really give them a bump, it didn\u2019t hurt them either. If you can remember all the way back (3ish months ago) to when Trudeau flew to Florida to meet Trump after he announced he was going to tariff Canada, his approval and that of the Liberals in general *cratered*. He wanted to look in control, but he came across as weaker than he already looked. It was after that incident when the numbers started showing the Conservatives with a run-away victory and the Liberals being practically wiped out. Trump had already started with the \u201cgovernor Trudeau\u201d business and the Liberals had numbers that literally could be called apocalyptic.\n\nWhat happened was threefold:\n1. Trudeau agreed to step down, so he stopped being a drag on the party.\n2. Trump didn\u2019t stop so the Canadians realized he was being serious. That put the nation in survival mode, for one, and, for two, it made a lot of people a lot more distrusting of Conservative politicians who associated themselves with Trump and Trump-like things.\n3. The Liberals picked Carney to lead. He\u2019s both not seen as politics as usual and he\u2019s seen as highly competent in economics. He earned a lot of respect for competently managing multiple economic troubles while telling people the truth without making many enemies.\n\nTLDR: Trudeau and the Liberals did the literal oposite of what Biden and the Dems did in the US and Trump doesn\u2019t know how to shut tf up and take a win. He snatched defeat from the jaws of victory for the Conservatives.",
