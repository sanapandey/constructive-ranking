The UC gave them a lot of grants but a lot of their families were barely covering current expenses. \n\nI remember I had a student who was debating between UC Berkeley and UCI mainly because of a difference of a few thousand dollars. Eventually he chose Berkley but it\u2019s wild that it was even that close for awhile. All of this is to say that the eye popping cost of college, especially housing there, is a big determining factor for many students from disadvantaged backgrounds.",

YMMV depending upon the campus and the major.  Generally for popular majors you will usually need to get a good GPA in the core courses for that major and overall in order to be approved as they will usually get more people trying to change into that major then they can accomodate.  \n\nOne other challenge is that it can be difficult even getting a spot in classes for popular majors if you aren't already declared for that major.  It isn't unusual that all the seats for core courses to be reserved for students in that major until after every single student has had a chance to enroll.  The non-major students will be dead last on getting an opportunity to try to sign up for those classes.  By the time non-major students are allowed to sign up for those classes there will be very few seats left in the class.  Those classes will frequently fill up so not everyone who wants to enroll in those courses.\n\nTrying that approach is risky if you really want to a degree in that major.  You may get stuck in a major you aren't interested in or forced to transfer to a different school.  Most high school counselors would probably suggest students to apply to at least one safety school that you are reasonably confident that will accept you into that major so that you will have options if your application to your dream school(s) dont' work out.  The other option would be just to attend a community college and transfer after finishing the lower division requirements.",
