It is calculated by dividing the total number of friendships between the counties by the number of Facebook users in each. Since I don't have the number of Facebook users by county, I used 2020 county populations, assuming that Facebook use is even throughout the country. [68% of US adults use Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/02/5-facts-about-how-americans-use-facebook-two-decades-after-its-launch/). After this assumption, I can find the proportion of each county's friends that live in each other county (including within-county) and from there calculate mean and median distances based on [county population centroids](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/centers-population.html).\n\nedit:  \nFor reference, if people were equally likely to be friends with all Americans: [https://www.reddit.com/user/haydendking/comments/1je9vv3/how\\_far\\_away\\_does\\_the\\_meanmedian\\_american\\_live/](https://www.reddit.com/user/haydendking/comments/1je9vv3/how_far_away_does_the_meanmedian_american_live/)",

If you live in the middle of nowhere you\u2019re very likely to have FB friends that don\u2019t live near you as a matter of necessity. \n\nPeer group mobility is a bigger thing. If you and the people near you came from other places, that\u2019ll boost your averages. Even if you don\u2019t move, how many of your friends have moved away?\n\nAnother factor is how friendly an area is. If people tend to move to town and don\u2019t make friends, they pull the average higher, but if people move to town and make a ton of friends, that\u2019ll pull the average down. That\u2019s just a small mitigation on the mobility measure though.\n\nAnother factor is Facebook prevalence. If you move from an area where everyone is on Facebook to an area where no one does, it will boost that town\u2019s average. If you move from an area where none of your friends used Facebook to a place where everyone does, it keeps the new town\u2019s average low. \n\nHonestly it\u2019d be really cool to get the full dataset and calculate how friendly every town in the world is by how many Facebook friends get made in the first few years after you move there. You\u2019d need to adjust for a lot of other factors like age (college towns getting a bunch of 18 year olds would skew a simple calculation) and Facebook use prevalence (an area with higher than average Facebook use would skew the data).",
