    "selftext": "This is a plot of \\~50000 galaxies that we made during summer 2024. The y-axis is the rate at which stars are formed within a galaxy and the x-axis is the redshift of the observed galaxy. The SFR values were obtained from Brinchmann et al. 2004 and we used the coordinates of these star-forming galaxies to get redshift data from DR-17. This plot may suggest a power-law between the SFR and redshift of galaxies within 0<z<1 .",
