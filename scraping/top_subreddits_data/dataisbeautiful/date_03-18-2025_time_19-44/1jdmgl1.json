    "selftext": "I ran a 204 day long experiment with a schedule where each day was randomly assigned to meditate either once or twice per day. I usually meditate for 15 minutes per session, so this came out to 15 min vs 30 min of meditation per day.\n\nI found that meditating more increased my readiness score the next day, increased my sleep score and sleep duration, and significantly increased my REM sleep the night after meditating. There was also a very small, but significant decrease in average heart rate and respiratory rate the night after meditating more.\n\nI wrote about these results in more detail, as well as how meditation impacted my mood, [on my blog](https://waragainstentropy.substack.com/p/meditating-more-made-me-sleep-better).\n\n**Source:** I analyzed sleep data automatically provided by my [Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/). The visualization was created with [Reflect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reflect-track-anything/id6463800032), a personal tracking iOS app I'm a co-creator of. I developed the self-experiment feature in the app and associated result visualizations)",

                    "body": "The experiment schedule was a random one (each day was randomly assigned to meditating either 15 or 30 min) which was my main approach to making sure other lifestyle factors didn't affect the results. If I had for example meditated 15 minutes for 100 days followed by 30 min for 100 days, I think the factors you highlight could have biased the outcome. \n\nThe Reflect app allows you to define confounding variables and checks if they differed between the two conditions, and I added some confounding variables related to exercise, sleep deprivation, and supplements I took. All of these were the same between the two groups with the exception of my intake of rhodiola rosea, an adaptogenic herb, which was 29% higher on days when I meditated more. Rhodiola was correlated with a lower average HRV the night after taking it, and increased heart rate overnight (other results like individual sleep stages and total sleep time had no correlation). So adjusted for rhodiola, the overall experiment result should show *more* of an increase in HRV and a *decrease* in lowest heart rate measured by Oura.\n\nWhat do you mean by plateau?",

I haven't reached out to sleep expert, but a sleep researcher found a previous Reddit post I made on the topic and contacted me about it, interested in expanding the analysis I provided! \n\nAs for benefits of meditation, I wrote about this in detail in two blog posts: [this one](https://waragainstentropy.substack.com/p/meditating-more-made-me-sleep-better) looking at data from three experiments, and [this one](https://waragainstentropy.substack.com/p/6-years-of-meditation-data-reveals) looking at a bunch of historical meditation data spanning 6 years. Paradoxically, it seems meditating more is at least correlated with mild increases in negative emotion for me (not actively while meditating, but later on the same day).\n\nWhile the first two times I started meditating regularly, I experienced a decrease in depression, the following trials were associated with an increase in depression. I have also found that the type of meditation I can practice has shifted over time. Initially, I started with the Waking Up app with guided meditation, and then followed a mantra-based meditation style, but over time, I have become more and more resistant to any specific focus of meditation, and have gravitated towards \"[just sitting](https://zenstudiespodcast.com/shikantaza/)\" meditation.",
