No western airline would buy it knowing it\u2019s less performant than Boeing/Airbus, and being from a different company requires completely new training, maintenance, procedures, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s also not certified by the FAA (so not an option at all in the US), and still undergoing certification in Europe. Current customers are Chinese state-owned airlines, which were forced to buy the jet to support the domestic manufacturer.\n\nThis is not to say that it isn\u2019t a tangible threat to the Airbus/Boeing duopoly. On the contrary, China\u2019s strategy may pay off sooner than we\u2019d think, and in a decade it may very well be a real competitor. Their next planes will be a lot better for sure.\n\nAlas, as of today there\u2019s really no viable alternative.",
