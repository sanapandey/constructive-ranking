A few shuttered storefronts in this area also contribute to the vibe.\n- an old super run down indoor mall is located there along with a massive Primark (ultra-cheap clothing). These both attract irascible youths shall we say. \n- if you go even a block or two away from this area it\u2019s significantly better. Across the park northwest is one of the nicest neighborhoods in the country, beacon hill. If you were walking along that side of the park you would have no idea that park street is sketchy.",

The streets and sidewalks everywhere around that were riddled with trash. There were not encampments or anything that I passed, but I could tell it was a really rough spot. About the dirtiest non-encampment place I have ever seen. Went a few blocks on the trail though and it was night and day difference. Really enjoyed myself after the shocking start.",
