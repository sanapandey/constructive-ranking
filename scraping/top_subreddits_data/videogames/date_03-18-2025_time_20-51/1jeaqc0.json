The alternative is using the sphere grid as little as possible until you unlock the airship which means facing some of the most difficult story bosses while severely underlevelled. It's *possible*, but tricky.\n\nGetting to Penance (The hardest superboss) can easily mean grinding for as long as it took you to get to that point in the game.",

You need to have your characters leveled and skilled enough. Using magic and weapons levels up your skill in em. But weapons break and magic casting can be slow.\nBefore facing the Gargoyle, you can find a good sword at the church. But you'll want to level a characters skill in swords by fighting with them. But getting a sword as a random drop can be a bit of a grind. Especially if you get a mystic sword. Mystic weapons only do MP damage.

It\u2019s a hard enough fight some would give up and accept her death but feels really rewarding if you just keep fighting until you both make it out alive.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the best combat showcases in the game. In a game usually about slow and methodical clearing of buildings in stealth the objective suddenly becomes to take out a ton of enemies in really quick succession before they kill your ally.

There is a path at the borken bridge on the right of Stormvail.\n\nRadahn is only optional if you intend to never play the DLC (and quite a big chunk of the main game).",
