I bought it again on sale on PC, tried it again, lost interest, and quit playing it. I bought it on sale on PS4 again to play on the PS5, played it for a while and lost interest.\n\nI recently started it again on PC a couple of weeks ago ***(now about 6-7 weeks ago)*** with the intention of pushing forward regardless of stupid bugs, janky controls, boring gameplay, and atrocious physics/animations.",

British guy find his \"zebra\" and his \"tiger\" and his lion, I've stumbled onto a couple of O'Driscoll hideouts and murdered all of them and stole their shit, I helped a one armed veteran again - but with money instead of a hug this time)*** I've collected some cigarette something or others and found some stone carvings...

I was riding my horse one evening and as the sun set, a thunderstorm rolled in, the game played just the right music for the situation, and in my brain I said, \"Okay... I can see why people enjoy this...\"\n\n... but then within the next ten minutes, there were an obnoxiously large quantity of wild animals running across the road, an entire town treated me like I was a rapist because I bumped into some guy with my horse, the game bugged out and I lost every one of my weapons and items when I was talking to a one armed Civil War veteran who just wanted a hug and reloading the save wouldn't help, I went to pick up bounty payment off a Sheriff's desk and as soon as I picked it up, he shouted that there was a thief in town and murdered me, my horse tripped over a small log, and I rolled down a mountain, ***(I was riding full speed parallel to a tobacco field fence, and my horse took it upon himself to attempt to jump over the fence... while riding parallel to it... so he belly flopped onto the fence, which killed both my horse and myself,)*** if I look at someone two seconds longer than they think I should, I get shot in the street, and if I defend myself, I get run out of town for assault or murder ***(or in the case of Strawberry and Valentine... the game shoehorns me into murdering hundreds of civilians,)*** every. single. physical. action. takes 2x-10x longer than it should because the Euphoria Engine was developed as a proof of concept for a football game almost 20 years ago, and the entire game feels like you're controlling a hippo on roller skates and the game requires you to be in the exact 1\" x 1\" square for anything to happen, so when you activate ABC or XYZ and you're not in that square, you have to wait for Arthur to casually saunter over to where he needs to be, every single aspect of the game was overdesigned because people have been led to believe that bigger/harder/more complex equals better of the last 20 years so I have to press the fire button 10 times to shoot 5 times, my horse has 25 gameplay mechanics attached to it if I want to walk, trot, saunter, sashay, jog, jog quickly, sprint, e-brake slide, rear, pat, pet, brush, feed hay, feed food, feed nuclear waste, etc etc etc.",

The other half of the team were trying to make a good video game with good video game gameplay and they failed miserably because what likely happened is they got to place they were happy with and someone above them said, \"Okay... now keep going for two more years\" and now every single feature in the game is aggressively overdesigned.***\n\n***I refuse to give up on this game this time. It's like watching The Godfather or Casa Blanca or Gone With the Wind or reading Lord of the Rings or To Kill a Mockingbird or The Grapes of Wrath or listening to all-time classic albums like Abbey Road or Thriller or Purple Rain... it feels like you're just supposed to have done it.***\n\n***Sooo...
