This was a time where gaming was finally beginning to break into mainstream culture and a lot of the new fans were playing games such as GTA and various sports games. Most people did not want to be seen playing \u201cthe kiddy console\u201d and the consoles design and Lack of 3rd party support really didn\u2019t help its case. \n\nLike sure, GameCube had Metroid Prime 1+2, Mario Sunshine, Animal Crossing, Zelda WW + TP, Mario Kart DD, MGS Twin Snakes,Re 1R 0(4 temporally also Viewtiful Joe), Mario Party 4-7, Luigis Manision, F Zero GX, Enhanced versions of Sonic Adventure 1 + 2, and Eternal darkness. Sure that\u2019s not every exclusive game, But it\u2019s probably at least half of the games everyone loves the GameCube for. The Ps2 alone had FFX-XII, MGS 2+3,SH2-4, DMC 1-3, GTA 3 Vice City and San Andreas, SMT 3, Persona 3+4, KH 1+2, Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, Ratchet and Clank,etc. I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface in regards to exclusives and that\u2019s not mentioning all the popular games that also came to Xbox the GameCube didn\u2019t get.  The Xbox had some good exclusives ( some decent Console Ports of PC games) but Halo 1+2 alone made the Xbox beat the GameCube along with it being the most powerful system typically having the best multiplats.\n\nAll in all I Love the GameCube, but yeah it\u2019s not hard to see why it failed.",

Nintendo got screwed over because a lot of publishers could release on PC, Xbox and PS2, but not GameCube.

The Saturn and Dreamcast barely sold 10m units each. The *Gamecube* outsold both combined.",

I enjoyed going to the GameCube kids house because he actually had games that were different which was interesting, it was kinda like going to the Dr Pepper's friends house when everyone else you knew drank Coke or Pepsi, not bad, just different. \n\nKind of ironically, Nintendo handhelds were the standard in that format at the time, so everyone had Gameboy Advances and DSes even though nobody had GameCubes, so it was kinda neat seeing things like Zelda and Pok\u00e9mon on the TV when you were so used to playing those games on a handheld.\n\nThe Xbox on the other hand just felt like shitty-PS2. They had all the same games, but had a weird fat controller and an ugly UI, even back then I couldn't think of a good reason to get an Xbox over a PS2. That flipped hard in the next generation, only a few of us had PS3s the rest were 360s, but everyone seemed to have a Wii collecting dust in their basement too so at least Nintendo caught back up in the console wars.",

Microsoft has never recovered while Sony has carved out a near monopolized console dominance in the non-Nintendo market, but there was a moment during the 360 generation where Microsoft seemed to have the upper hand, at least in the U.S.",

The console was cheap and had so many huge game series specifically made for it while also having been backwards compatible. Sony also massively profited from the fact that their competitors fumbled big time. The Game Cube and Dreamcast were massive flops and the XBOX came out a while after the PS2 so it naturally as a newcomer didn\u2018t see the success of the already established PS2. There is a reason for why the PS2 is generally seen as the greatest console of all time. For the year 2000 that thing was insane, especially for the price.",

Uncharted 4, God of War, Spider-Man, TLOU 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Gran Turismo Sport, Detroit: Become Human, Bloodborne, Infamous Second Son, Ghost of Tsushima, Death Stranding and so many more. And then there are also 3rd party games like RDR2, FIFA, Madden, Skyrim, Fortnite, Rocket League, Minecraft, Call of Duty, Battlefield, GTA, Resident Evil 7, etc that saw massive success on the console, often using the PS4 in their advertisement. That combined with the fact that the PS4 had practically no competition from XBOX and the huge problems the PS5 faced in the first two years due to a lack of availability makes for a perfect recipe to become the 3rd best selling home console of all time (technically second since the Switch is actually a hybrid and there are versions that are fully handheld).",

Are you out of your mind? \n\nThis is the best way to do it, the games are only exclusives temporarily, it gives PC gamers the option to buy a PS5 to play them or wait for them to come to PC, and it doesn\u2019t affect console PS5 players at all because the games are still not on Xbox\n\nWhich answers our question of why is Xbox not selling like it used to, there are so many great games that have come out this gen that are PS5 and PC exclusives, they are not on Xbox, and well there\u2019s also a lot of games that have come out this gen that are Xbox Series and PC exclusives, but they are not great, they are bad, but that might not even be the case because Xbox is putting a bunch of those games on PS5 like Hi-Fi Rush and Forza Horizon 5, why tf are they doing that? I genuinely have no idea\n\nSo what I\u2019m I saying here? There\u2019s still a reason to buy a Nintendo Switch, there\u2019s still a reason to buy a PS5, less reason if you already have a PC but there\u2019s still reason, and there\u2019s no reason to buy an Xbox \n\nAnd I also wanna bring up GTA 6, you would have had to hit your head really hard as a baby for you to choose the Xbox Series as the console you\u2019re going to play GTA 6 on instead of the PS5",

Unless they come up with some gimmick to make them more useful, I would bet good money that they will only last a couple more generations before finally being phased out.  With Xbox probably being the first to go, and the PS being the one that will try to change it up.  Nintendo will definitely be the last one standing between the 3 of them due to their uniqueness and title exclusivity.  Even game makers admit that they prefer making games for the PC over the consoles due to how restrictive console game requirements can be.  With games being released on most systems at the same time, one of those options is going to end up being prefers and the others are going to fall to the side and it DEFINITELY won\u2019t be the PC being pushed to the side.",
