Harley takes out Batman only for it to be revealed by a comic or something that it was just Brainiac copies of the Justice League and not the originals; or the whole game is set in an alternate universe (which is what I prefer over the lousy copies excuse). None of it made any sense and it just broke my heart and all these choices were not woke, it's just the nature of bad video games which is always BAD WRITING and not political like these extremists from both left and right seem to argue about. Just keep politics and suits out of video games and we can all be happy",

So in 3 how you could use that machete to kill people in 5 you just sorta punch them or snap a neck lol. Still cool just not the same type of visual badass one man army type gameplay that was the norm for the series. Primal is a toss up since they changed the weapons from guns to clubs and spears lol. Could ride around on a sabertooth tiger though so that was interesting.",

You should also be allowed to criticize the dev team for legitimate reasons. If the game comes out as broken as I've seen in a lot of the streams Ubisoft have done recently, the team should be criticized. The problem is how very Canadian things like this can be. As a Canadian, I have watched our government freeze bank accounts, demonize and imprison its own citizens for criticizing our government. Free speech should be protected. If you don't have the stones to put your work out to the public to be criticized, you should probably do something else. Speech is not violent unless it calls for violence. Putting out a product that is as wildly disrespectful to a culture as this one has proven to be, deserves all the disrespect it has coming.",
