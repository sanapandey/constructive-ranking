Still bad game.\n\n  \nMetro is highly immersive series, i liked the first game, but Last Light didn't improve anything and doubles down on the boring stuff, i played it out of necessity to see where things will go, but i didn't enjoy it at all.\n\n  \nYou like Dishonored, have you ever played Prey? Thief? System Shock 2? Deus Ex? those are some great and amazing immersive-sims, you must play them!\n\nYou can also play Splinter Cell Chaos Theory which is one of the best stealth games to date.\n\nOr some other interesting games i can recommend based on what you enjoy.\n\nYou showed me great potential with Dishonored, its time to replace Call of Shooty and Generic Ubisoft game with a seal of quality game.

I also recently got the first Dishonored game, as I lucked into a GOTY Edition for less that 15 bucks at my local game shop. So far I'm really enjoying it, the options at your disposal at any one time is at the same time a lot to deal with and exhilarating.",
