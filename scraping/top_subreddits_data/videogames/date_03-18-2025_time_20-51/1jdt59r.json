                    "body": "\u201cu/KickStreaming answered confidently. Surely *this* was the correct answer. When the blank line of a new comment appeared on u/KickStreaming\u2019s screen and they had the ability to type out *any* combination of letters into that blank box, there was absolutely no other combination that could\u2019ve been inputted. After all, the only two characters in that game where the narrator and the player. The entire game was all about obeying or defying the narrator\u2019s carefully laid out story!\n\nAnd if I may toot my own horn for a moment, it was a truly magnificent story. All about the concept of free will in a video game. It was brilliant. But then Stanley had to go and muck it up.\n\n\u2026Oh, but I can\u2019t stay mad at Stanley. I do miss him sometimes. Stanley at least wasn\u2019t as predictable as the 3 or 4 hundred of you that voted for this comment. The Stanley Parable is the perfect choice for this slot, sure, but look at your collective creativity in selecting \u2018man vs man\u2019. It\u2019s TF2! Blu Mann vs Red Mann! Brilliant! \n\nSo why couldn\u2019t you simpletons delve a little deeper for the post modern entries? Is it because video games haven\u2019t explored post modernism? Are we really so primitive of a story telling medium? The Stanley Parable came out 12 years ago and we still haven\u2019t topped it, is that what I\u2019m supposed to get here?\n\nThough admittedly honored to see my game hold up as the work of art it is, I believe it is time we push video games *forward* as a story telling medium. Perhaps another game exploring the relationship between player and the game developer\u2019s intended design\u2026 another Man vs Author meta-narrative\u2026. Yes, I can see it now\u2026. I think I\u2019ll call this game\u2026 \n\n\u2026The Stanley Parable 3!\u201d",

A passerby sees it happen and comments \"Uh, he fell\". 100% neutral statement delivered without any inflection.\n\nHow does the man on the ground respond? will he be defensive with a  \"thanks, captain obvious\"? Will he make excuses with something like \"There's a hole there!\"? Will he laugh it off and get back up? Will he scowl and get mad at himself for falling? Will he accuse the one commenting of tripping him? Will he lay on the ground with his face in the asphalt contemplating how his life led to that point?\n\nHonestly, it could be *fascinating* to put a thousands people under observation while playing \"Getting over it\" and see how they react not to the game but to the Narrator's comments.",

It's a trap.\n\nStanley's Parable is men vs narrator, and narrator and author are two different things. It's a game that puts you into the man vs author conflict, but it's crafted, the man talking to you isn't actually the author, it's just a narrator that plays the role of an author.\n\nSuper Mario 64, on the other hand, is the most speedrun game in history.

Like why do I have to chain-connect teleporters if they're just going within my base?  Annoying and awkward, especially since the game seems designed to encourage you to travel around quickly within base limits.\n\nAlso the fact that you unlock, like, 80% of the tech in the game all at once when you find the Anomaly feels like bad design, though I don't know if it qualifies as anti-QoL.\n\nAnd then there are a lot of anti-QoL features that are added just so you can unlock solutions for them later, like having to farm supplies to make launcher fuel.  Some of the Man-vs.-Author-ness of the game is by design.",
