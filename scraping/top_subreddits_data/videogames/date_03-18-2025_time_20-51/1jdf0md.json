You just gather resouces and gear and level up at the vendor bases to aquire better stuff. If you die, you lose everything. But you get one life to retrieve your shit. If you die its gone and you start from scratch again. But you have permanent storage at the vendor bases and you can build a base too. The bases are only vulnerable in PvP. They're safe in PvE.

Map Cards are red, green or blue with value of 0-9. So, 30 possible values.\u00a0\n\n\nOn higher floors, you run into doors needing multiple cards, such as (Blue > 8 and Any < 2 and Any > 4) or (Red = 3 and Red = 4) or Sum 30 of Green. Or a notorious door with Sum 30 of each color. The top floor is 20 rooms. Teleporting between floors locks all doors again, too.\n\n\nSo why can we only carry 99 of these, total!?!? Good luck farming for Jokers or the \"Key to Rewards\" cards for each of 13 floors when you have to hold <99 for them to even spawn, and each card thrown away feels like a time-delayed game of Russian Roulette.",

The super limited inventory at the very beginning, slowly building up, and even then, youre inventory is still very limited compared to the amount of stuff you can collect in the endgame. I dont need like 100 inventory slots, but at least dont start off giving me just a measly 8-12 for the amount of drops there are.",
