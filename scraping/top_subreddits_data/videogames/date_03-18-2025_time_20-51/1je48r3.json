    "selftext": "A friend of mine told me that he is very happy to have met me and that he thought of \"the best possible gift for her\" so he gave these Pok\u00e9mon DS and 3DS games for my birthday, with their boxes included. Honestly, he nailed it (I've always loved Pok\u00e9mon since I had the chance to play some of them like Diamond or White, but didn't really own them). He assured me they were his so I don't have to worry about the price, which relieves me hahaha. All of them are in Spanish (my native language) but SoulSilver that is in german (I'm studying it so I could play it regardless). I am so grateful and speechless! Now I will finally have the chance to play them\ud83e\udd79",
