    "selftext": "Received a small padded envelope delivered via Royal Mail 24 hr tracked service. Inside was just a strip of paper that said on it:\n\n\u201cDear Customer,\n\nPlease note we are unable to ship your order via this courier. We have used an alternative courier. Please see tracking details below\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s a tracking number with the last 4 digits written by hand, it says it\u2019s a Yodel tracking number.\n\nIt\u2019s signed \u201cRegards Admin Team\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m not expecting an order that I can think of, and whenever I\u2019ve ordered anything I give my email address so wouldn\u2019t they just email? Why send a package? There is also no reference to an order number, company (other than Yodel the delivery company) or what the order is.\n\nSo weird. So is this somehow some kind of scam? What does it mean? Why would someone pay to send that note to my house?\n\nI\u2019ve not looked up the tracking number because I\u2019m wary although I\u2019m not sure what looking it up could do.\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

This is a shipping scam - somebody buys an item which the \"seller\" has no intention of sending. They mail a notice like this to get the buyer to wait longer so that the time limit to file a claim runs out. It works more often than you might think.",

                    "body": "Hi /u/doublelxp, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Brushing or Direct shipping scam.\n\nThe scammer is creating and shipping out fake orders in order to both boost order numbers and place false verified reviews. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing) is the Wikipedia page that explains brushing, and [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/27/americans-are-receiving-unordered-parcels-from-chinese-e-criminals-and-cant-do-anything-about-it/#dc1df7c73daa) is a news article from Forbes about the scheme. Receiving packages as part of brushing doesn't mean that your private information is compromised, if the items are relatively inexpensive.\n\nIf instead you received an expensive item, such as electronics or something like that, your account may be compromised. Log into your account and see if there are orders under your name. A scammer that has access to your account would instead be using your credit card, or a stolen credit card to purchase things in your name and ship them, and then have a porch thief pick them up from your door.\n\nFor example, when Amazon accounts are compromised, orders can be archived by the thieves to hide their tracks. Go to https://amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history?orderFilter=archived to find any of those. If that list is clean, it means that this order didn't originate through your account.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
