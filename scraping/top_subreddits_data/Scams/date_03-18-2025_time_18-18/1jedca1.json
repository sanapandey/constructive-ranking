    "selftext": "My wife recently called an 1-855 phone number thinking it was Amazon Customer Support. One of our packages had been delivered to the wrong address and we wanted a refund. She says that they were able to pull up her account through her phone number and asked for her zip code and last 4 digits of the credit card. Then, they proceeded to tell her that there was unauthorized account activity in Houston, Texas and although we couldn\u2019t see anything on our account, they needed us to go to the nearest Dollar General/Walgreens and provide information to prove that we are in NC and we didn\u2019t initiate the unauthorized activity? When my wife would mute the line, the lady would remind her not to mute the line because this is a recorded call and she should stay on the line until we arrived at Walgreens.  \n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t matter but the lady had an Indian accent. This is 100% a scam. My wife just realized she got the phone number from a sponsored Google link which we reported.  \n\nMy question is\u2026 what\u2019s the scam? What are they hoping to accomplish?",

Not Amazon, not Wal Mart, definitely not Facebook or Instagram. They are 100% scam numbers. Even if you click through a Reddit link and someone says \"I was able to get through using this number...\" nope. Scam.\n\nOnly ever use the real numbers found on a company's web site. Their real web site - check the URL!\n\nIf a company doesn't have a phone number published, that doesn't give you liberty to go find one via Google. You have to use the stupid chat or email features on the site instead.",
