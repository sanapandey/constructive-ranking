These are usually long con !romance scams (can also lead to fake inheritance or gold, fake children to care for, fake charities they want your help to \"donate\" to, unexpected emergencies that they ask you to pay, fake crypto trading site they urge you to try after a while etc)",

They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be [members of military](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html), [oil workers or doctors](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams). They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to [financial ruin](https://globalnews.ca/news/5095659/romance-scam-money/). Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.\n\nIf you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Scams) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

Generic compliments, over-the-top flattery, and asking you to send the friend request are common tactics. Scammers use these lines to get people to engage, then slowly reel them into phishing attempts or scams. No personal info on their profile and a random mix of friends with no real connections are huge warning signs. If something feels off, it usually is. Better to trust your gut and stay cautious.",
