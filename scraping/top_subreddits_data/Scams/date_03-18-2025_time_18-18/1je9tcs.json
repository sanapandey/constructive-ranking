    "selftext": "Q: **Why are there so many rules?**  \nA: Scams are serious problems with serious consequences. Our rules are put in place to make getting helped easier, to help as many people as we can, or to prevent further harm to the innocents. They are not there to make things harder. We don't want this volunteer job to be any harder for ourselves either. But it's the price to pay to make this million-user sub works the best for majority of users and visitors, safely.\n\nQ: **Why can't I post screenshots or pictures?**  \nA: You can. But we want meaningful description of what's in them. It's for visually impaired users and also allows Google to index the information. Don't make the images the only path to understand your post.\n\nQ: **Why can't I post live web address?**  \nA: Reddit will suspend your account if you post a clickable link to a known scam site. We are trying to protect you.\n\nQ: **Then how do I let people know what the site is?**  \nA: Add the site address in the post title. But don't make it the only thing in the title. This way it won't be clickable. And Google loves post titles from this sub. You can also add extra characters to make a link unclickable. Like reddit dot com.\n\nQ: **Speaking of title. Why do you want a long title?**  \nA: We don't want long titles. We want meaningful ones. We added some quick messages to point you to the right direction when you create a post. But they require more than generic title like \"is this a scam\" to work. A good title also make it easy for people to help you. It will also make it more visible in Google search results.\n\nQ: **My post asking about an online store is removed. Why?**  \nA: There are millions of online stores out there. We can't know how to identify all of them. Forums that focus on the product you are interested in are much better places for the question.\n\nQ: **Why can't I ask people to PM or email me?**  \nA: Because that's how recovery and other scammers contact their future victims here. And without public scrutiny, scammers will have a really good chance selling you their schemes. You came here for help from crowd wisdom. Private messaging prevents us from helping.\n\nQ: **I want to expose a scammer. Why can't I post their name, number, and address???**  \nA: Scammers are not dumb. They fake all the information presented to you. The information is most likely stolen from innocent people or organizations.\n\nQ: **But I am 100% sure it's scammer's info!**  \nA: No, you are not. We are also not sure if you are telling the truth. You might be doxing someone to harass them. We don't know. So don't do it.\n\nQ: **So that's why I can't ask people to flood their phone number or mass report them?**  \nA: Exactly. It's called Personal Army and it's absolutely, 100%, not allowed. \n\nQ: **Why is my post removed while other similar ones remain?**  \nA: This is a million-user sub. We can't monitor every single post or comment. We rely mostly on our users to let us know when something is out of line. So please report contents that you think are violating our rules.\n\nQ: **Why are there some really old posts pinned at the top of the sub?**  \nA: They are either being brigaded by spam comments and reports, or someone hired a bunch of armature \"takedown artists\" to harass the moderators to take them down. We are just giving them the attention they seek.\n\nQ: **\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u8a9e\u6587\u767c\u8a00\u55ce\uff1f Can I post in Chinese or other languages?**  \nA: \u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u5efa\u8b70\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u8cbc\u6587\u5927\u6982\u6703\u5f88\u5c11\u4eba\u56de\u61c9\u3002\u8acb\u7528\u7ffb\u8b6f\u5de5\u5177\u7ffb\u6210\u82f1\u6587\u52a0\u5728\u6587\u5167\u3002 Yes, but it is not recommended. Your post will probably get few responses. Please use a translation tool to translate it into English and add it to the post.  \n(*The English text in this Q&A was translated using Google Translate*.)\n\nQ: **Why did you remove my 3,000-word\ud83d\udd25, Nobel-worthy\ud83c\udfc6, emoji-boosted\ud83d\ude80, detailed\ud83d\udd0e scam report\ud83d\udccb? I spent like 5 minutes\u23f1\ufe0f telling an AI to write it!!**  \nA: Basically we don't like AI generated text. OK. We hate them. They are fluffy, ill-formatted, unnecessarily long, and hard to read. Make your post concise with necessary details. Format it clearly and simply. If you have language issues, write in your own language and use a translation tool to translate it to English.\n\nQ: **I got banned for x days for calling someone a moron. Are mods too stupid to see a joke?**  \nA: You've just been permanently banned. Enjoy the free upgrade.\n\nQ: **Wait. I thought this is a sub for us scammers exchanging ideas??? I just want to know if this credit card info seller is legit?!**  \nA: Get lost. Banned.",

            "body": "This is a great breakdown of why the rules are there in the first place. Scammers rely on chaos and confusion to get people isolated and vulnerable. The rules aren\u2019t about making things harder\u2014they\u2019re about protecting everyone and keeping this space safe. I've seen people fall for scams simply because they got pulled into private messages or clicked a sketchy link. Transparency and public discussions make it a lot tougher for scammers to operate. And yeah, posting personal info can do more harm than good since scammers often use stolen identities.",

We're working on automoderator rules that catch certain keywords and provide some fast answers.\n\nWe always indicated people to read the wiki before searching, then search before posting, but hey. Also we remove more things than you can see! A lot of sextortion posts get removed for safety reasons vefore they see the light of day: they have one simple answer and letting them live would expose the victim to recover scammers.\n\nAnd in some cases like the typical task scam, where we know scammers will change website addresses as they change underwear, a new post with the new website address in the title makes google cache it and that new Google search can be saving someone a lot of money.\n\nIt sucks, but sometimes we need those repeated posts.",

But we can't force them to follow.\n\nWe do think the messages are working since many of the old regular scams stopped showing up as frequently. It might be scammers moved on to the next schemes but we like to think positively. :)\n\nWhat users here can help is to respectfully tell them about the search function and the keywords to use. More people need to learn how to use search as a research tool. Not just here, but in all places that provide it. We want people to learn skills to protect themselves, not just the names of scams.",
