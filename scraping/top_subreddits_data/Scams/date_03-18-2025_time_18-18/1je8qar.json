    "selftext": "The person who asked for a commission is offering to pay $700 for 3 drawings of his kids that are fully colored, shaded, and have full backgrounds. I told him my price for all three would be about $105 ($35 per comm), but he seems adamant to pay the $700. He started the conversation over Tiktok before asking to move over to Discord, then the first thing he asked me was where I was from. I ignored the question because it just felt like a red flag, but he kept pushing so I just told him im from the Us. He asked where I take payment and I said paypal, and when i gave him my username and email to pay, he never responded. I havent gotten any emails about a login request, and this feels just shady overall. im not sure if this is a scam and I will be sent counterfeit money, or if he\u2019ll ask me for money back when I finish the commission and the counterfeit money will just be taken from my actual bank account. Im desperate for commissions, but I dont know if I should trust this?",

                    "body": "Hi /u/TheMoreBeer, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Artist or NFT scam.\n\nThis is a variant of the advance fee scam. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. A scammer will contact an artist, and ask to purchase one of their works of art (paintings, digital media or photos), and they will offer a generous sum of money. It can take three forms: a fake payment email (in which you're instructed to pay some fee to receive the money), a fake check (in which you're asked to forward some money elsewhere), or a fake NFT minting scam.\n\nIn this latest variant, the scammer suggests to buy the art piece in NFT form. The victim is instructed to mint the NFT in a fake minting website, which charges money for the fuel (as any NFT minting service does). The difference is, the scammers control this fake website and run away with your money. After you mint the NFT, the scammer disappears without paying for the piece.\n\nThis is a scam where a scammer impersonates a client. For the scam where a scammer impersonates an artist, call the automoderator trigger (muse).\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They'll either get free art out of you, the pay will be fraudulent and clawed back, or they might \"send too much accidentally\" and ask you to send them some of it back. Last one is a whole different kind of scam I forget the name of, but typically it works by relying on money being sent and not caught by fraud departments or fully cleared, victim sends money back, then gets hit with all the sent money being credited from their account when it's reversed. Then you're out the original money that was sent, and the amount you also sent as well. But they're banking on you being excited to get 700 dollars.",

The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.\n\nScammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.\n\nA variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your best bet is to go over a rough sketch of it with them and ask for the payment or partial payment, make sure it goes through before you finish working on it and when you send the final put a huge copywrite mark over it (slightly transparent but not easy to remove), do a pattern and make a pattern on the artwork itself so they can't just use a brush to cover it, when they pay you remove the copywrite mark. If you've seen videos of people saying \"do this so AI can't steal your art\" it's not actually for AI, it's for humans.",
