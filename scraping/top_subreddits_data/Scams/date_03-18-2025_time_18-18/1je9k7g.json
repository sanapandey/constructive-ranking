                    "body": "Hi /u/Helostopper, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.\n\nFake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.\n\nIn either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim\u2019s account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer\u2019s wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer\u2019s wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.\n\nIf the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer\u2019s Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer\u2019s Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer\u2019s wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer.

The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \\\"recovery agents\\\" or hackers.\n\nWhen they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.\n\nIf you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.\n\nRemember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They have whole fake sites set up and once a deposit is made it\u2019s gone but they don\u2019t stop there the \u201cinvestor\u201d can see numbers going up. So most deposit even more money they only realize they\u2019re being scammed when they attempt to withdraw. The fake company will say their account is locked and require even MORE MONEY to unlock. It\u2019s a well orchestrated scam, some people harm themselves so keep an eye on your friend. If he used US his bank for any of the transactions start getting police report so hopefully the bank will refund",

What they're describing is not how they operate.\n\nTrustpilot is also an absolute joke of a website that no one should rely on for anything.",
