    "selftext": "My husband hung up on a guy who was trying to offer him settlement money through \"the victims of terrorism act\" through 9/11. There's a few things wrong with this.\n\n1. We live in Wisconsin, and he doesn't have any family in New York.\n2. He was twelve during 9/11.\n3. 9/11 was almost 24 years ago, so why call now?\n\nThe company is called \"RC Associates,\" or \"Rising Capital Associates.\" They have a .us website that requires a password. The guy did give my husband a password. We didn't put it in. (We probably won't even if this isn't a scam.) Looking them up it looks like they're a debt relief company? (Or at least the guy is using the name of this company.) But we don't have any debt.\n\nMy husband mentioned scams and the guy was like \"No, we're the opposite of that- we give money!\" which is... How do I say it? Kind of sketchy sounding? He also said that he doesn't understand why my husband is on the list when my husband pointed out that he was twelve at the time.\n\nWe're kind of weirded out by the whole thing and I just want to know if this is a scam or not.\n\nSome context that might be relevant: My husband *did* get settlement money. He was caught in a fire when he was a baby and since the house didn't have any smoke detectors in it he got a settlement. But those payments stopped a few years ago.\n\n**Edit:** That was fast! We both figured that it was a scam, but we just wanted to make sure. We'll be sure to tell his boomer relatives about this so they don't fall for this. Thanks!",

The site is https://www.vcf.gov\n\nOP\u2019s phone call is still a scam though. You have to apply to the fund with a legitimate claim. The fund may call people in certain circumstances regarding a claim but do not ask for ss numbers, bank account info etc. \n\nBut since your husband did engage with them, be prepared for a lot more scammy phone calls coming your way as the scammers search for the right approach that could possibly get him on the hook. You might want to stop answering unknown numbers and let them go to voicemail. Scammers rarely leave a voicemail.",

So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.\n\nIt can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.\n\nIf you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again.
