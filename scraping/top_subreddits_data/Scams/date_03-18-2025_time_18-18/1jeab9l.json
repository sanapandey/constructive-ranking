    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I own a small business, and frequently have salespeople come in for credit card processing, offering much better rates than I see offered from any of the major credit card processing companies. Somebody came in today and handed me a business card for their business (Elite Business Solutions), which didn't even have a website on it, but had a Facebook link which I put in the title of this thread. I look them up and they just look like an obscure business - how would a little business like this even be able to get into the business of offering credit card processing to companies like mine, nevermind at much more competitive rates than the big national companies? \n\nI totally get scammy vibes from these folks, as they come in at least every couple months from similar companies, always with insanely good rates. There's no way I would trust all of my business's incoming revenues to some no-name company that doesn't even have a website - what if they just disappeared with all my credit card transactions?\n\nBut I do wonder if this is a known scam of some sort, and if so, how it works? Is it as simple as I route my credit cards to process through their bank account, believing I have a good deal, and then they just take off with my credit card deposits and that's it? Seems weird that they would show up in-person at my shop, on my cameras and everything. Or are they a legit business? I searched in the common scams thread and didn't see anything about this.\n\nI read and am trying to follow the How To Write a Good Post thing, so hopefully I did it right. Thank you in advance for the input!",
