    "selftext": "So I posted my car and had some interest. I was chatting with someone and they asked if I could buy a carfax type thing but they didn\u2019t want to use carfax they wanted to use a link they provided. Super silly and I feel like an idiot but I filled it out with all my information and CC info. I realized it was a scam shortly after and went to my bank and canceled the card. What else can I do to protect anything further happening? I feel so stupid and I don\u2019t know what to do. Please if you have any suggestions please let me know! ",

Just only deal with ppl that answer your questions (as if you were standing next to them).\n\nNothing more to do besides cancel that card and block/report the scammer.\n\nIn general, if you're selling something, ppl give you money and you give them the item. You shouldn't be paying for anything else.",

                    "body": "Hi /u/KTKittentoes, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Car sales scam.\n\nIf you're buying a car, a scammer will list a car on a marketplace site and will ask you to email them. They will tell you that they will ship or otherwise transport the car to you and allow you to inspect it. They may use the name of a company like eBay or Amazon to make the scam sound more legitimate. The scam is that the car does not exist, despite whatever pictures you have received, and you will be asked to pay for the car using gift cards, crypto or irreversible wire transfers..\n\nIf the seller is real and wants to actually meet, you may face a different type of scam (which involves a run down, stolen or otherwise bad deal of a car). To prevent this, you need to meet at a mechanic's shop you trust and have a full inspection of the vehicle. Remember all sales are final when dealing with used cars. The seller needs to come to meet you, so as mentioned above, the offer for a courier doesn't help.\n\nIf you're selling a car, the scammer will try to have you pay for a verification on a scam website, some VIN check lookup or certificate of records of some sort. Remember you're the seller, you set the terms. If you want to provide some certification, use a website you trust. They can do their own verification if they don't trust yours. And also, they can try to pull a fake check on you. No buyer is sending a courier to pick up a car they haven't seen.\n\nAnd again, if the buyer is real and you actually sold the car, the same rule applies: all sales are final, so do the proper paperwork, consult a subreddit dedicated to car sales and make sure the transfer is completed.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
