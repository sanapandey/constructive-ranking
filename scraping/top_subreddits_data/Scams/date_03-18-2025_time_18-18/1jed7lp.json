They didn\u2019t want any bank info just my pay pal or cash app. I explained I don\u2019t send nudes, and they said they don\u2019t want nudes they just want to send money. \n\nI asked about crypto to see if it would change their response and they seem to be okay with crypto. \n\nWhat could this be? I really want the money lolll but I don\u2019t wanna fall for any scam. I know when something is too good to be true. ",

                    "body": "Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.\n\nSugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.\n\nThe second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.\n\nIn the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Anybody who says they want to give you money for \"being pretty\" or for chatting with them, or for pictures of your feet / nails / whatever, is actually a scammer, who will take your money. The offer of free money is always a scam to get your money.\n\nThere are several ways they can get your money, one is to ask you for 50 for \"verification \" before they send you 2000. You give them 50, and they disappear.\n\nAnother scenario: They give you this generous gift, say 500. Then they ask you to send 200 to their favorite charity (which is actually them). So, you think: why not? You still have 300. Oops, you don't really, because PayPal takes back the 500 because it's stolen. End result: you gave a scammer 200, and you have nothing.",
