    "selftext": "Been super frustrated, so looking for any advice. Long story short, about a month ago, I was buying something from someone online (on Reddit actually). They requested I pay through an Amazon DoorDash gift card (suspicious, I know now), and then surprise surprise they were a scammer. Thankfully, I realize around an hour after purchasing, so I immediately contacted Amazon support and to my relief, they said they would refund it. Figuring I'd caught it in time, I stopped worrying about the issue. But it turns out this was little more than an empty promise.\n\nOver the next month, I had multiple exchanges with customer support saying that it hadn't been refunded, but\u00a0**this time**\u00a0it would be. But now their Escalation Team is telling me that they can't at all since it's been redeemed, and I have to contact DoorDash (who obviously cannot help).\n\nSo I'm just at a loss. Is there someone at Amazon to email to pressure them into following through? Do you think I could contact my bank about it?",

                    "body": "Hi /u/t-poke, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.\n\n[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \\\"recovery agents\\\" or hackers.\n\nWhen they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.\n\nIf you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.\n\nRemember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
