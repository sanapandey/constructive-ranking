    "selftext": "For context:\nA month or two ago, I had got an email from a school staff member that asked me to fill out a form to be a student assistant for a professor (I wasn\u2019t the only student that got this email). Today, I had received a message from the person I was supposed to work for and we did a virtual interview (I was asked 3 questions). After answering those three questions I was told that I was basically told that I was hired (now that I\u2019m writing this, I\u2019m starting to see that was a red flag). I was sent forms to fill out and one of those forms I entered my capital one bank account number and my email. A couple minutes ago I got an email for an e check and I\u2019m just now starting to question the legitimacy of this whole thing. I don\u2019t use my capital one bank account but I honestly feel silly for putting it down on the form.",

This post may be about you asking for help, it may also be you warning you about a new scam. Whatever the case may be, this post will help hundreds of other people if it's searchable. We want to make sure your title summarizes the scam being described.\n\nIf you agree that your post doesn't have a good title, delete the post yourself, and post again. If this post is about a scam website (or a potential scam website), make sure your new post contains the website address in the title (not in the post).

                    "body": "Hi /u/t-poke, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.\n\nThe fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.\n\nBanks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.\n\nWhen the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html\n\nIf you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
