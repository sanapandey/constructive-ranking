    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been getting non stop calls from a number with the caller id as \u201cCapio partners\u201d at first i didn\u2019t respond & figured a voicemail would be left but nothing. I answered the next call and the line was silent then ended after a few seconds. I called back and there was no response. I ended up blocking and they called with a different number. I do remember when i was 18 i went to the hospital & didnt pay my bill (i was dumb) so im trying to figure out if this is because of that but there\u2019s literally no communication??? I haven\u2019t received any mail, nothing on my credit report. Just dead calls. I googled them & all the reviews say it\u2019s a scam. I know they have a website & are an actual business though. They have a site where u can put your info to check for any bills or accounts with them but i don\u2019t feel safe putting my information in like that when there\u2019s so many bad reviews. Any help???? Also im 21 now, it\u2019s been at least 4 years since ive even been to a hospital. ",

            "body": "Capio Partners is a legitimate debt collection agency, but scam callers often spoof their name. Since you're getting silent calls with no mail or credit report updates, this is most likely a scam. Do **not** provide personal info on their website. Instead, check your credit report for any medical debt and contact the original hospital directly to verify if you owe anything. Block the calls and report them if they persist.",

                            "body": "FYI - medical debt will no longer show up on a credit report due to recent legislation. It is quite possible to owe a medical debt and not be aware of it.\n\nHowever, debt collectors are required by law to identify themselves when they call, and that includes voicemail. The fact that they aren't leaving messages is suspicious. You are under no obligation to call back if they don't say who they are.\n\nIf you do end up speaking to them, always ask for a debt validation letter. A legitimate collector will provide it - a scammer will try and weasel out of it. And note that it has to be a physical letter - emails and PDFs don't count. Don't answer any other questions, and don't agree to anything until you get the letter and have verified it with the creditor.",
