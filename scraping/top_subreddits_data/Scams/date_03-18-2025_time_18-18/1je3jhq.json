    "selftext": "I went to Alaska for 5 months in 2014 and worked with a bunch of philinos and Caucasians.  I shit you not. Almost every Caucasian that has been working in Alaska for more than 1 season was dating a model looking philipina who they've never met. From the plant manager down to the grunts.\n\nMy bunkie was a 27 year old who constantly bragged about his \"girl\" to me.  I asked if they've ever met, no. Have they video chatted? He said no, they mostly text.  I shit you not, I asked him to call her, and they said that she's really shy and doesn't like talking..  so he calls her, and the \"girl\" says \"hi\" and then pretends that the connection was going out. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude04. It was a damn scammer, probably one of his coworkers, who he exchanged numbers with. \n\n I told him that it's a scammer and he defended her.  Ego is a crazy thing.   The next day, the scammer gets my bunkie to send her 2 weeks' worth of pay for a medical emergency.  Poor guy was making $7.25 an hour, getting taxed to hell and back on his 100+ hourly checks, and he sends $1500.\n\n\n",

Punishments can be swift (administrative proceedings with minimal due process) and severe (barred from attending State schools, ejected from oublic schooling system, etc). \n\n\n>I know *plenty* of people personally who have gone up to peers/friends/mutual friends, asked them out, and have not had any of the above happen to them.

Orobably 5-10% of approaches I have witnessed in my life. I've also had the displeasure of seeing false accusations slung around a few times, with victims punished despite evidence because \"a lawsuit would be expensive\". It's not worth a 5-10% chance of your life effectively being over. And plenty more not willing to risk homelessness over a failed approach. Finances aren't a joke anymore. \n\n>You just said it, bar culture and hobby culture hasn't changed. Youth culture has. Youth culture is going to dating apps because it's the easiest way to find someone on common ground\n\nIf this was true, we'd see dating exploding, not collapsing. We are not witnessing that. Young people consider in-person approaches to be unwelcome and perhaps criminal and not worth doing. I cannot stress enough how widespread this understanding is. It's why a supermajority of young men have never approached; it's beaten jnto them from a very young age that to do so would be criminal.",

The last sentence really explains scam victims:\n\nAccording to linguist David W. Maurer\u2019s book The Big Con (1940), there was a similar adage amongst American con men in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: \u201cThere\u2019s a mark born every minute, and five to trim him and five to knock him.\u201d Here \u201cmark\u201d refers to the intended victim of a scam; \u201ctrim\u201d means to steal from; and \u201cknock\u201d means to persuade away from a scam. Hence, the overall meaning was that there is no shortage of new victims, nor of con men, nor of honest men who want to save a mark from being scammed. Maurer adds that the saying was often used ironically because all con men knew that a mark, once he had \u201cthe fever\u201d thinking he was about to win lots of money, \u201cliterally cannot be knocked.\u201d\n\nAnd I must say: that thing about \u201cthe fever\u201c\u2026 I have noticed that all of these scams are about falling in love with somebody who is either rich, inheriting, or showing them how to make tons of money off of crypto. And none of them are \u201csend me money just because I need help.\u201c There\u2019s always an element of greed.",
