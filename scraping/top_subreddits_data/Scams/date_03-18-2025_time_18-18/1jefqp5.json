    "selftext": "SCAM ALERT! Listen up friends, I received a voicemail from a Sgt Kenneth Cooper today (Who I NOW know has been retired since 2020). He said I must call back immediately. The voicemail seemed legit and I called back. They said I had two bench warrants for failure to appear and contempt of court for missing jury duty for a federal grand case!! They said it was mailed to an address (which was my old address) and that somebody signed in my behalf! I was scared!\n\nThey gave me citation numbers, court dates and everything! At first, I thought it was a scam so I told him to call me from the sheriffs office. Well, they were able to clone that number and call me to where The caller ID said \u201cPublic Service\u201d and it was the sheriffs office number in Mecklenburg County. \n\nI had two options: 1- go to the sheriffs office and turn myself in and figure out a way to pay $1500 for each citation, or pay over the phone and then go to the sheriffs office for a signature analysis and the money would be refunded. They said I was under a gag order due to the case that I was assigned jury duty for so I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it. Lonnnggg story short: \n\nDon't be fooled! My daughter was smart enough to call the sheriffs department from her phone and was informed that The sheriff's office will never call or email you demanding payment or making arrest threats. \n\nSo yeah, I got GOT. I\u2019m working with my bank to have my money refunded and I filed a police report for these people impersonating officers. Something in my gut told me it wasn\u2019t right!",

            "body": "Never, ever talk to any police or law enforcement when they call, real or fake. Say goodbye and hang up.\n\nThe real police will never call and tell you that there's a warrant for you -- if there is really a warrant for your arrest, they will show up at your door.\n\nIf you believe that you may have sone legal problem, tell the police that you will talk to your lawyer, and hang up.\n\nCalls from the sheriff / police / ICE / FBI etc are often fake. The incoming phone number is spoofed, so it seems that the call comes from the sheriff's office or wherever, but it's a scammer calling you.\n\nScam calls and texts can fake any phone number, anywhere. This means that Caller ID is not reliable. \n\nScammers use spoofing technology to fake the incoming number, so the number they call from can appear to be any number. Caller ID could show a nearby number, your bank, or your local police -- any number. But they are actually calling from somewhere else, possibly from somewhere in Asia or Africa, from a big scam call center.\n\nIts best to not answer calls from unknown numbers. But, if you answer a call that appears to be from your bank, or your local police: say goodbye and hang up. Look up the actual contact information on the official website. And don't call a number in Google search results -- top result may be a bogus phone number (paid for by scammers).\n\nSimilarly, if you get a text message from your bank, don't call the number in the message. And don't click any links. Look up the real contact information on the official website.",

            "body": "Missed Jury Duty scams show up about three times a day.\n\nWhen my wife received the call from the \"Sheriff's Office\", it was one missed summons that supposedly she signed for (was a different signature) and they originally quoted $4,500, which got worked down to $3,500 and eventually $3,000 before I got through to the Sheriff's Office non-emergency number before we did any withdrawal form our bank account. And once the Sheriff's Office could confirm this was a scam my wife hung up on them and they haven't called us back, nor has any deputies from the Sheriff's Office shown up.\n\nIf any \"government\" authority wants payment by gift card or cybercurrency (such as bitcoin), it is a scam. Part of the reason for gift cards and cybercurrency is that they cannot be undone; scammers take the numbers and redeem them and then there is no way to claw back the funds and it is very likely they are located outside of your country so your country's law enforcement agencies have no reach into those countries.",
