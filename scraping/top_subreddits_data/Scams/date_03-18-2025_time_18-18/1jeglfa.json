    "selftext": "I\u2019ve gotten quite a few calls like this one over the last few months. They always call from a different number and they always leave a different number for me to call back. It sounds like a different person each time too. Each time, their voicemails are exactly the same. \n\nWhile I do have some debt, I have payments worked out, so to my knowledge I shouldn\u2019t have anything that has gone this far. \n\nThey\u2019ve called my parents too. They called my mom last time and my dad called back and basically told them off. This time they also called him. I\u2019ve noticed that the area code usually matches whoever\u2019s phone number they\u2019re calling. \n\nThe first transcription is my voicemail and the second is my mom\u2019s. Has anyone encountered this? Is this a scam?",

Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.\n\nLike legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.\n\nHere's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/\n\nYou need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze\n\nReport correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
