I personally know a few folks who became fans of the game because of the London Games also, but it's not this alone that has grown the game.

The NHL will have to work for it, but the potential \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 to the league would be worth it. \n\nThe thing with ice hockey here is you will of course have your international fans, the more \"serious\" home grown fans are up north where there's more of a presence with the EIHL. But again the numbers aren't high. \n\nThe only reason I'm an ice hockey fan is I have a lot of family in Vancouver and got into the game during the 2011 cup run. I have struggled to find any ice hockey fans here at all. \n\nThe NBA has managed to grow here despite crazy TV times also, but again it's very easy to pick up a basketball and go and shoot some hoops. The NHL does try to put on one game a week at 18:00 for the international fans but it's on like a Sunday. \n\nAs for playing the game you'll struggle as many people can't ice skate here for starters! A game here would be just the start, you would need to do more with it to make it really grow. Make no mistake about it though, it's good for the NHL, sponsors would love it.",

But I do also live in quite a rugby dominant area and, whilst some rugby fans are rather receptive to the NFL, I just don\u2019t think the appeal is there for many when you could just watch rugby instead. In some ways I think ~~ice~~ hockey has an edge there in being a somewhat more distinctive product, especially when so many people play field hockey growing up but eh.\u00a0\n\nI think the NHL will always struggle as a product in the UK because to many here any sport played on ice is painfully upper class. Lived in Cornwall for 4 years growing up and there\u2019s not a single ice rink in all of Cornwall, and there\u2019s lots of areas where that\u2019s the case.\u00a0\n\nFunnily enough I\u2019m also a fan because of American friends and family. But yeah I also think it\u2019s pretty hard to meaningfully grow sports in the UK because the sports market here is so insanely saturated. Football, F1, rugby, etc. definitely doesn\u2019t help that the Stanley cup finals tend to coincide with international football - I\u2019d say the nfl has the edge there having playoffs in a bit of a lull period for other sports.\u00a0",
