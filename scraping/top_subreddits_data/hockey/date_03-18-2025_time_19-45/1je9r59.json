The Bills made the playoffs for the first time in 17 years before even drafting Josh Allen just from hiring the right coach and beginning that culture change process. \n\nPegula is a hockey guy first so I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s very hands off with the bills. But tries to do too much and stay involved in hockey operations with the Sabres. I\u2019ll always be grateful for him making sure the bills stay in buffalo, but man it can be frustrating when it comes to the Sabres",

The difference is their best players like Brady, Stutzle, Chabot etc. were sick of losing and determined to turn it around, which reverberated around the dressing room to the rest of the team.\n\nBuffalo needs their most talented players to be leaders, but it seems they usually just want to bail and let someone else clean up the mess.",

So Cozens would have been some security around that.\n\nHaving Matthews in a cozens trade would be insane, the return would have to be astronomical. A likely package could have been a 1st or two, Ben Danford (probably leafs best defensive prospect), and knies. I\u2019d love to keep Knies out of it and throw in a Robertson instead, but that would depend on how well the sabres can be finessed",

Norris is good defensively and Buffalo is bad there, where cozens has been apparently bad in that regard. \n\nThey\u2019re both enigmatic players for different reasons, I don\u2019t think this trade makes sense to fully evaluate until the end of next season. \n\nNorris is just a harder player to replace, there are few 26 year old players that have scored at the rate he has available for trade",
