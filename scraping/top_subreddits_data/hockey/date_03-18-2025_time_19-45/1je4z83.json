That is my dream first round. All 3 Canadian teams making it to the second round and having a potential for a leafs/habs ECF. The only other thing I would love but would probably kill half the leafs fan base due to heart attack would be if we beat Tampa in the first, Florida in the second, Boston (unlikely for them to make it but you never know) in the ECF then the Jets.
