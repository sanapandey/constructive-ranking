Initially bewildered, he comes to grips with his plight and determines present day Germany has many of the issues of 1930s/40s Germany.  Everybody thinks it's some comedic/hack pretending to be Hitler, but soon Hitler's ideology resonates with Germany, social media spreads the cult of personality, and group think takes over. \n\nIt not only gives insight into the rise of Hitler but it sadly depicts the current state of affairs.  A false profit rallies people on small morsels of truth (border issues, defunding police issues, etc), but once the collective forms they stop thinking for themselves.  As the more radical ideology and policy takes form, normally harmless (by themselves) people are galvanized and stay to the end.  \n\nYou can watch the movie on Youtube right now, for free.  Its scary how accurate it is.",

(Largest voting base is 65+ so obviously avoid old people) He actually got less votes in this election than he did in 2020, and he didn't win the popular vote in 2016. He won 2016 because of the corrupt and archaic electoral college. You're generalizing quite a bit, and I understand to a degree because what he's said about Canada is appalling. But, it's hurtful to lump those of us who are actively trying to fight this bullshit into what is actually a considerably small margin of the US population, generally speaking. (Roughly 20%)",

But if you're going to a national park, I'd assume it's not to interact with humans. As a visitor to the country, you'd be much more likely to find a liberal or non-voter if you visited any major city on the coasts, Minnesota, etc. That being said, no, I wouldn't visit our country right now. Because with all the unconstitutional, completely illegal, things they're doing right now to people on visas and even legal residents... I wouldn't feel safe being from outside the country.

I\u2019m sure the courts will step up and stop this fascism any day now\u2026\n\nThere also comes a point where enough is enough.\n\nBill James wrote a piece some years ago on how the Black Sox scandal may have been what shifted the attitude of the general public toward one of ferocious anti-corruption.  The previous 20 years had seen juries bribed, governors in bed with organized crime, judges on retainer from criminals, and a staggering amount of violence and open contempt for law.  But when *baseball* was being tampered with, that's what became too far.  Because while the average person may have generally avoided running afoul of the law, *everyone* was a fan of baseball (or sports in general).\n\nThe complete news vacuum that a ton of people live in is shocking, especially in a day and age when information is so readily available.  When I was a kid, my primary source of immediate news was *The Columbus Dispatch*.  If I needed more daily sources, our school library had *USA Today* and *The New York Times*.  Today, I get my news from between 15 and 40 sources every day without having to exert any real effort.\n\nIf an active player were to come out and say \"my family and I were threatened with physical harm or financial ruin because I declined to be sent to play hockey in a war zone\", that's something that would carry a tremendous amount of weight.  That's not just people on one side of a political spectrum or another who would be aware (on unaware) of that - it's *everyone* who's a fan of that team or that player who sees it.  If a player were to come out and say \"the federal government tried to revoke my work visa to prevent me from playing this year\", or \"the government tried to revoke my passport to prevent me from playing games in the other country this year\", that - whether right or wrong - speaks to the average person a lot more than some of the other tomfuckery that's been taking place in the last eight weeks.\n\nThe diversion of bread and circuses only work if the supply of both is unimpeded.  This would be a very dumb hill for a bunch of government lowlifes to make their stand on.\n\n>Best of luck to you running for office. And I mean that very seriously. From my perspective as a Democratic primary voter, I\u2019m looking for representatives who understand the moment we are in and are prepared to do everything in their power to fight this fascist regime.\n\nThank you.  I'm not one who goes around looking for a fight, but if one comes I'm not backing down.\n\nLeadership isn't about shying away and saying \"what will happen to me if I act?\" - it's about realizing \"what will happen to everyone else if I *don't* act?\"",

The \"Sudetenland Crisis\" which was annexing a portion of Czechoslovakia with the excuse of \"protecting ethnic Germans\" (something we've heard recently from Russia about Donetsk and Lugansk.)\n\nWhat happened after that? The Munich Agreement! Basically an agreement saying \"okay, we will allow you to have the territory if you promise that would be all. No more territorial expansion, okay?\" They chose to concede to Hitler's demands (much like Trump and morons think we should do for Putin)\n\nOddly enough, that didn't stop him. He occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia not a long time after the Munich agreement and months later, they invaded Poland.",

You can view any millitary map such as deepstatemap (pro ukraine) to track the territorial changes over time. Russia gained massive momentum in the Donbas after Ukraine started their Kursk incursion. August-December 2024 saw record territorial gains for Russia since the initial invasion in 2022. Prior to the sudden fall of Kursk this week, Ukraine had already lost 50% of their initial gains from August. But it happened very slowly over a number of months because Ukraine were well dug in, but cracks had been beginning to show for a number of weeks now.\n\nUsing Ukrainian lives like they are a chess piece because it will help us kill more russians is incredibly selfish. Ukraine has banned men over 18 from leaving the country and have forcible conscription. It's easy to tell others to fight a war when your and my family aren't the ones in the trenches.",

Nathan Mackinnon for example is obviously someone who would be picked, he's canadian but plays in the US.   US revokes all his visa's if he doesn't play.   Refueses work Visa's for non US nationals on Canadian teams, throwing thier careers/canadian teams into chaos.   there's plenty of pressure that can be applied to non US teams, when the majority of games played are in the US.  Mackinnon would also be paying US tax so can make life hard for him on that front. etc.",

The events did nothing for them on the global stage in the long run. Sochi was a total disaster for them that even if the World Cup was a moderate success there, it was well offset by the Olympics. Once Russia hosted the World Cup, did their global standing all the sudden become better in the Western world? I don't think you can make a strong argument for it. I don't think the concept of sport washing is effective in the least bit. Maybe it makes people who live in the country have a brief morale boost for a few weeks? That's probably the best point I can argue in support of the practice.",

But yes, I can see why there is opposition to oligarchs profiting from projects related to these events at the expense of the debt the country incurs from hosting it, since those costs are then passed down to the average citizen. That's a reasonable take. I think it happens in the Western world too though with the bidding that goes on for these capital projects. Los Angeles may minimize that with the existing infrastructure in place though in 2028. What do you do if you're the IOC though in 2022 and your options were China or Kazhakstan because no one else wanted it? Kazhakstan is trying to do the same thing other previously mentioned countries are doing by trying to attract sports, but they just don't have the funding or infrastructure to have as much of an appeal.",

While we respect Russians as individuals, we have no interest in any engagement politically or economically that could be seen to legitimate the terror organization of Valdaimir Putin.  While we understand that some of our players and fans may have other views on this war, and some of our players would love to participate in such a game, there is such a thing as objective right and objective wrong.  Russia invaded Ukraine.  Repeatedly.  Russia started this war.  Repeatedly.  We will not be used as a shiny bauble to distract from the genocide performed by the present Russian regime.
