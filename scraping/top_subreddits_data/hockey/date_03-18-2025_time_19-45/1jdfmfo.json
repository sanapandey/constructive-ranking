Each ranker has their own system and have their own reasonings and analyis. It truly is a lot of work.**\n\n### Rankers\n>!/u/raymondliang /u/bahamas_is_relevant /u/mdlt97 /u/maxpowr9 /u/sandman730 /u/driftshade11 /u/copaceticvindication /u/steckums /u/joetothejack /u/kellervo /u/timmablimma /u/americanada98 /u/hockeycross /u/paynetrain181999 /u/silkeystev /u/lang14 /u/thefragrancevol /u/assassin2107 /u/oksoundtracks /u/nodessb /u/beedrill13 /u/dagetawayman421 /u/rasera /u/eatingasspatties /u/rawrberry_ /u/dr3amweav3r !<\n\n### Organizers\n>!/u/lang14 /u/thatmikeguy429!<\n\n## Visualization\nThe visualization contains historical data, so you can see how your team has done over time. Hopefully, we can run this for many years in hopes that we can see the rise and fall of teams by /r/hockey opinion.\n\nIt automatically updates so feel free to bookmark. You can find it [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/icydata#!/vizhome/PowerRankings/rHockeyPowerRankings)\n\n## Process\nHow does this work? Throughout the course of the week rankers are able to access an app that will allow them to rank teams. At the end of the period we calculate the average ranking for every team and collate all of the analysis provided by rankers.\n\nThe app then generates a post that is first proofread and then posted to /r/hockey!\n\n## Rankings\n\nRanking (avg) | Team | Delta | Overall Record | Record This Week | Comments\n:---:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\n1 (1.62) | [Winnipeg Jets](/r/winnipegjets) | - | 47-17-4 | 3-0-0 |  **rasera says** Clinching and Elimination Season is finally upon us! Jets needing a combination of 7 pts from wins and Calgary or Vancouver pts lost to clinch a playoff spot. But a playoff spot isn't enough this season, and I never would've guessed I'd be saying that at season start. Let's go Jets! Get that President's Trophy, and carry that momentum into the playoffs!  |\n2 (2.85) | [Washington Capitals](/r/caps) | 0 | 44-15-8 | 2-1-0 |  **dagetawayman421 says** I'd like to take this opportunity to rave about some Caps prospects. Ryan Leonard and Cole Hutson both make Hockey East's First All-Star Team. Ilya Protas just broke 50 goals for the Spitfires and is tied for second in the OHL in points. Andrew Cristall is leading the WHL in points. Also want to mention Connor McMichael and Aliaksei Protas both breaking 100 points for their careers this season! At this rate, they could both end up being top 10 players of the 2019 draft!  |\n3 (4.15) | [Dallas Stars](/r/dallasstars) | 0 | 42-21-3 | 0-1-1 |  **rawrberry_ says** Winnipeg just know even though I have y'all number one on these rankings in my heart y'all are number 2,000,000. For ruining Pi Day I will be sending some a harshly worded letter. The Stars had a rough weekend against two of the better teams in the Central division. With a chance to gain some ground against the Jets the Stars lost. Against the Avs the Stars fell behind and then managed to score two goals in 20 seconds after they remembered they were playing a hockey game. The Avs also ruined Mikkos return by not letting him score. I personally don't know why the Avs are so mean. The Stars do have two games in hand but they need to snap whatever funk they are in.  |\n4 (4.42) | [Colorado Avalanche](/r/coloradoavalanche) | 1 | 41-24-3 | 3-0-1 |  **hockeycross says** Avs are on a 9 game point streak. Other than the OT loss to the Wild they have been flying since the break. Avs are starting to fit together, but still a few too many lapses for 5-10 minutes have let teams get back in games. If they can play a full 60 they can probably beat everyone and anyone. Really nice for Mackinnon to get point 1000 and a good ceremony as well. Avs are pushing for Home Ice vs Dallas as that may be crucial in the series.  |\n5 (4.54) | [Carolina Hurricanes](/r/canes) | 2 | 41-22-4 | 3-0-0 |  **timmablimma says** Mark Jankowski is the best player from the 2012 draft as evidenced by his four goals on four shots setting a record since shots started getting tracked in 97/98. A seven game winning streak, four of which are after the Rantanen trade feels good. Scott Morrow looks like he belongs and our defensive core looks great for years to come. Turning a corner going into mid March is great, if only we could fix the powerplay.  |\n6 (5.19) | [Florida Panthers](/r/floridapanthers) | -2 | 40-24-3 | 1-3-0 |  No Pathers blurb this week, sorry.  |\n7 (7) | [Vegas Golden Knights](/r/goldenknights) | -1 | 39-20-8 | 1-1-2 |  **bahamas_is_relevant says** An utter dud of a road trip leaves me with some serious questions about this team. Salvaging a point from the Pens game by itself is a miracle (Hanifin you beautiful bastard), but losing it on terrible goaltending was rough. Hertl's unselfish cool-teammte move vs Buffalo was decidedly not rewarded by the karma gods, and the Detroit game was an absolute wet fart of an effort. Only real highlight was the CBJ game, but given they've been shut out a bunch recently, maybe that was more a product of them than us. At least goaltending wasn't the problem in 3 of the 4 games - Sammy sucked against Pittsburgh, but Hill got shelled against Buffalo and Sammy didn't get any goal support in Detroit.  |\n8 (8.46) | [Tampa Bay Lightning](/r/tampabaylightning) | 0 | 38-23-5 | 1-1-1 |  No Lightning blurb this week, sorry.  |\n9 (9.77) | [Toronto Maple Leafs](/r/leafs) | 0 | 39-23-3 | 1-2-0 |  **lang14 says** Leafs not looking very playoff ready, lately. Hoping we can get it together. Really need that #1 spot in the Atlantic.  |\n10 (10.08) | [Los Angeles Kings](/r/losangeleskings) | 1 | 36-20-9 | 3-0-0 |  **raymondliang says** Starting to find some rhythm now when we're playing with our strongest possible roster. Foegele and Moore have remembered how to score, Byfield has stepped up as a top playdriving center, and Kuemper is backstopping great games. Just don't play Rittich.  |\n11 (11.54) | [Edmonton Oilers](/r/edmontonoilers) | -1 | 39-24-4 | 2-2-0 |  **eatingasspatties says** The Oilers are seemingly incapable of scoring goals anymore. For all the talk about their D and goalies, the biggest problem of late is goal scoring, despite Drai being on an 18 game streak and McDavid on an 11 game streak. (Bouch's 8 gamer just ended). Allowing 8 goals in 4 road games this week is pretty sick, but scoring 9 is concerning  |\n12 (11.62) | [Ottawa Senators](/r/ottawasenators) | 1 | 36-25-5 | 4-0-0 |  **driftshade11 says** It's weird to feel relatively safe about this team's prospects this late into the year, but here we are. Convincing wins all week have given the team a lot of buffer room, but they do need to keep moving.  |\n13 (13.77) | [Minnesota Wild](/r/wildhockey) | -1 | 37-25-5 | 1-1-1 |  **paynetrain181999 says** This week really was really a microcosm of the Wild's season so far.  A good win vs a heated rival via a Gus Bus stonewall, an extra time loss in a winnable game, and a thrashing vs a team lower than us in the standings.  Brodin is back skating in practice, so that's an encouraging sign, but Kaprizov is still a ways out, and our offence needs him like a desert wanderer needs water.  Looks like a wild card spot is in the cards for us, which would be an easier path, if there is such thing as an easy path in this cutthroat conference.  |\n14 (14.12) | [New Jersey Devils](/r/devils) | 0 | 34-26-6 | 2-1-0 |  **silkeystev says** This team has Jack, Dougie, and Siegs out and we finally start winning again, only to put up a stinker against the bottom of the metro penguins.... We tried to come back in that one thanks to some timely double minors but this team is still an enigma to me honestly.... Just waiting for playoffs at this point.  |\n15 (16.88) | [St. Louis Blues](/r/stlouisblues) | 1 | 32-28-7 | 2-1-0 |  **beedrill13 says** This team, man. The boys just keep playing high urgency, high quality hockey every night. As of Sunday, we have officially climbed all the way back to a tie with Vancouver for the final wild card spot. With everyone playing to their potential, the sky is the limit for this team and if we do make the playoffs I like our chances against anyone in a seven game series. Only time will tell what's in store for this squad.  |\n16 (17.19) | [Montreal Canadiens](/r/habs) | 3 | 31-27-7 | 2-0-1 |  **We are looking for a new Habs ranker for next season, if you are interested please message /u/ThatMikeGuy429** **mdlt97 says** The Habs stay in the mix with a great week. The Top Line continues to dominate games and put the team in a position to win games, Goaltending has been excellent, and the team is working as a collective unit to get the job done.  |\n17 (17.31) | [Vancouver Canucks](/r/canucks) | 1 | 31-25-11 | 2-2-0 |  **joetothejack says** Elias Pettersson has returned, just in time to help the team make the playoffs. Playoffs hinge on Pettersson's production as our only top 6 centerman. Quinn Hughes has once again shown he is the heartbeat of this team, and despite not playing at 100% is showing why he's a true Hart candidate and easily the top defenseman in the league. Next the Canucks need Brock Boeser to begin scoring again and Thatcher Demko to return from injury and the Canucks are right back to being scary.  |\n18 (17.88) | [New York Rangers](/r/rangers) | 2 | 32-29-6 | 2-2-0 |  **nodessb says** We're back? Maybe? For the time being the Rangers are in a playoff spot somehow. It feels like this team is failing upwards somehow but who knows if that'll last. There have been flashes of good play but overall honestly it has not been very pretty. I hope the boys can string together a few wins and solidify their playoff standing but I honestly have no idea what to expect in the coming weeks. LGR!  |\n19 (18.38) | [Calgary Flames](/r/calgaryflames) | -2 | 30-24-11 | 0-1-1 |  **kellervo says** Easiest way to sum this up over the last calendar month: Goals for: 32nd. Expected Goals for: 31st. Shot %: 31st. High Danger %: 31st. Shots for: 27th. Quite possibly the WORST month I have ever seen for any team doing these rankings, and comparable to the 2016-17 Avalanche and 2019-20 Red Wings. We are still clinging onto the wildcard because of one stat. Save %: 3rd. Just give Wolf the Calder or we riot.  |\n20 (18.62) | [Columbus Blue Jackets](/r/bluejackets) | -5 | 31-27-8 | 0-3-0 |  **steckums says** Yikes. The Jackets have lost 5 of their last 6 games, being out scored 22-5 and shutout in three of those games. This is also the first time since 2008 that the Jackets have been shut out in consecutive games. The playoff dreams are by no means over, but the hill to climb is only going to get bigger if the Jackets can't figure something out.  |\n21 (19.85) | [Detroit Red Wings](/r/detroitredwings) | 0 | 32-29-6 | 2-2-0 |  **americanada98 says** The wings played really well this week, but did not get the desired results. They missed a buzzer beater against Ottawa by a second, and were shut down by Carolina, but scored and competed extremely well against Vegas and Buffalo. They need to keep getting some luck, as they are on the outside looking in for the playoff chase.  |\n22 (21.54) | [Utah Hockey Club](/r/) | 0 | 29-26-11 | 2-1-1 |  **oksoundtracks says** Utah is making a push for the playoffs, and I can't remember the last time I was so stressed out...But Veggie is already proving to be more than worth his recent extension, Guenther and Captain Keller are as clutch as ever, and the injury bug is finally off our backs! The biggest issue we have right now is consistency, which is what we'll need if we're going to leapfrog some teams in the standings! But I finally got to attend my first home game, which was the best sports experience of my life, so I'm just going to be grateful for every win! Potter, Dewey, and Jazz: If you're reading this, I love you all :)  |\n23 (23.5) | [New York Islanders](/r/newyorkislanders) | 0 | 30-28-8 | 1-1-1 |  **We are looking for a new Isles ranker, if you are intrested please message /u/ThatMikeGuy429**  |\n24 (23.85) | [Boston Bruins](/r/bostonbruins) | 0 | 30-29-8 | 1-2-0 |  **maxpowr9 says** As amazing as that Florida come back was, this team is still dookie. It's been one step forward and two steps back this season. I'd rather watch the 2015 Bruins than this lot. At least said team knew how to shoot; they'd be low-danger shots but at least they shot. Second time this season to have no SoG in a period is beyond awful. The only solace was Vasy had a worse sav% than Sway in the L.  |\n25 (25.46) | [Seattle Kraken](/r/seattlekraken) | 2 | 29-33-5 | 2-0-1 |  No Kraken blurb this week, sorry.  |\n26 (25.58) | [Anaheim Ducks](/r/anaheimducks) | -1 | 29-31-7 | 1-3-0 |  **We are looking for a new Ducks ranker, if you are interested please message /u/ThatMiktGuy429**  |\n27 (25.92) | [Pittsburgh Penguins](/r/penguins) | 1 | 28-30-10 | 3-0-0 |  No Pens blurb this week, sorry.  |\n28 (26.62) | [Philadelphia Flyers](/r/flyers) | -2 | 28-32-8 | 1-2-0 |  **assassin2107 says** Well the one good thing is that the pick is going to be great this year. On the other hand, this team looks awful since the trade deadline, don't put too much stock in that win over Tampa. I will say that it's funny to see Flyers twitter whine for literally years about how they need to trade Laughton, why is Laughton still on the team, etc. and now that he's gone Flyers twitter can't stop talking about how much this team sucks.  |\n29 (28.46) | [Nashville Predators](/r/predators) | 0 | 25-33-8 | 1-1-1 |  **thefragrancevol says** I'm afraid the Predators might become what the Sharks are right now once Marchessault and Stamkos get too old to really produce at a high level. This could be a really tough rebuild to see the Predators go through  |\n30 (29.19) | [Buffalo Sabres](/r/sabres) | 0 | 26-31-6 | 2-1-0 |  **dr3amweav3r says** Lol. Its always an amusing game when Eichel comes home. Otherwise, we need to lose bad so that Terri might wake the fuck up and fire Kevyn Adams. Fat chance, I know.-  |\n31 (31.27) | [Chicago Blackhawks](/r/hawks) | 0 | 20-37-9 | 0-3-0 |  **sandman730 says** The Hawks went 0-3-1 on their 4-game road trip. Levshunov made his NHL debut and earned his first NHL point. Donato has 12G, 18A (30 pts) in 29 GP in 2025. Bedard received 10-minute misconduct penalties in back-to-back games.  |\n32 (31.38) | [San Jose Sharks](/r/sanjosesharks) | 0 | 18-41-9 | 1-2-0 |  **We are looking for a new Sharks ranker, if you are interested please message /u/ThatMikeGuy429**  |\n\n## PWHL Rankings\n\n### Rankers\n>!/u/disastrous-two-6697 /u/sensitive_tax4291 /u/paynetrain181999 /u/oksoundtracks /u/nodessb /u/ladylexxi /u/x-tremememeteam !<\n\nRanking (avg) | Team | Delta | Overall Record | Record This Week | Comments\n:---:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\n1 (1.38) | [Montreal Victoire](/r/) | - | 16-5-2 | 0-0-1 |  **x-tremememeteam says** Call me crazy but lately Montreal has not looked like themselves and if it wasn't for their sorching hot start I am not sure they would be in first.  Right now I don't see them beating Toronto or Boston in a 5 game series  |\n2 (2) | [Boston Fleet](/r/) | 0 | 13-6-4 | 1-0-0 |  **x-tremememeteam says** Boston is on fire they have a nice little point streak and are...only 2 games back of Montreal.  Who knows they might be able to steal 1st.  |\n3 (3.13) | [Toronto Sceptres](/r/) | 1 | 11-7-5 | 0-0-0 |  **sensitive_tax4291 says** With the season winding down Toronto is still fighting for second place. Injuries to key players have interfered with a repeat of last season's dominance. With players coming back soon, hopefully Toronto can bring it all together for the final stretch and into the playoffs.  **x-tremememeteam says** Toronto is riding high after last week especially beating Montreal.  I think they have safely secured a playoff spot now they have prepare for the rest of the season and for May.  |\n4 (4.13) | [Minnesota Frost](/r/) | -1 | 12-9-4 | 0-2-0 |  **disastrous-two-6697 says** The Frost are very much back. 2 good wins this week plus a close game against Montreal proves that they can compete in the postseason, something I have doubted due to previous performances. Should be smooth sailing to the playoffs from here for the girls, after that is when it gets interesting.  **disastrous-two-6697 says** Just when this team has me thinking they're ready to contend, they swing my opinions in the other direction. Now, the Frost's season is in no way over, but if they continue to play like they played this week, the chance of going on a run is next to nothing. The girls have an off-week next week, and hopefully they can win me back after but it's going to be tough with games against Montreal and Toronto.  **x-tremememeteam says** The Frost are again flirting with letting another team overtake them late in the season they need to get back in gear and win these pivotal games  |\n5 (5.13) | [Ottawa Charge](/r/) | 0 | 9-10-4 | 1-1-0 |  **x-tremememeteam says** Ottawa has done so/so as of late the only problem is that it very well may be too little too late the loss to the Fleet could prove to be a death blow.  |\n6 (5.25) | [New York Sirens](/r/) | 0 | 9-10-4 | 2-0-0 |  **ladylexxi says** THIS TEAM WILL NEVER LOSE AGAIN!  **x-tremememeteam says** I get they got 2 wins but coming off 9 losses New York stays in last sorry.  |\n",
