They switched their eligibility to Kazakhstan in 2016 so that they could play in the World Championships. Kazakhstan didn't qualify for the 2018 Olympics and all three missed it since they were ineligible to play for Canada and the States after they changed nations. Nigel Dawes was the leading scorer in the KHL at the time of those Olympics.\n\nEdit: [To play in the IIHF World Championship, the Olympic ice hockey tournament and the qualifications to these competitions, players must fulfill the following qualification requirements:  Each player must be under the jurisdiction of an IIHF member national association.

At the 2019 World Championship, they were in Division 2A and only avoided relegation after beating Belgium on the final day.\n\nItaly, meanwhile, finished 2023 (the year that determines seeds for 2026) ranked 18th. Unfortunately for Italy, the cutoff of teams that advance directly to the final round is 17th, so Italy would have had to play 2 rounds.\n\nTheoretically, they'd have been in a group with the #23 seed (Romania), #24 (Lithuania) and a team from the previous round (ranked 29th or lower). I can't see them not getting out of that kind of group.\n\nThen you put them in the final round where they'd have been Q4 (as the highest seeded team to advance), and they'd be in a group with #11 (Denmark), #12 (Norway) and #17 (Slovenia). That might have been tough but I think they could have held their own.\n\nAt the World Championship, Italy is usually hovering in the Division 1A range and have made no shortage of appearances in the main tournament over the last few years.",
