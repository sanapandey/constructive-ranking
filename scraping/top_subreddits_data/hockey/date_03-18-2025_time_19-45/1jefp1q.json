After the game watch alot of tape and change the game plan up",

The playoffs are very samey year to year now, let's mix up the matchups. Keep the wildcard setup so divisional games matter in regular season, then reseed 1-8 come playoffs.",

Nobody had them making the playoffs. I think if they keep doing what they've been doing, and they have a chance to make it far.\n\nWinnipeg, I think the pressure could get to them again. The past two regular seasons Hellebuyck had incredible stats, and a sub .890 save percentage in the playoffs. If he can shake his demons, they will make it far. The pressure will be on him, and facing some combination of Colorado, Dallas AND Edmonton just to make it to the finals will be incredibly difficult.\n\nWould love to see Hellebuyck win the Hart, Conn Smythe, and the Stanley Cup this year. He's one of those players who has to win a cup at some point. He just has to continue to stand on his head until June.",

Since 2010 the league leader has only made it past the 2nd round 3 times - the 2021 Golden Knights (lost in the CF), the 2015 Rangers (lost in the CF), and the 2011 Canucks (lost in the cup finals).

In the off-season they took some chances on players with huge potential and those chances paid off. I think Carbs has the touch for getting the best out of young players and disgruntled players who were unhappy in another locker room. He has built a team that just has a chemistry I've never seen in a lifetime of hockey. Watch the post game locker room video, there's a vibe going on. Look at how many players in that locker room have already hit the mark for personal best seasons in so many ways. \n\n Also, watch big Protas. His off-season improvement is something you don't see. He went from being a big kid with potential to becoming a force on offense and defense. I know people discount the value of +/-, but Pro is +41. We have one player who is minus, and that's the guy we picked up at the deadline.",
