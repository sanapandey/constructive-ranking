Our top-6 frequently includes retreads like Marcus Johansson, an aging -- albeit still reasonably productive -- Zuccarrello, an oft-injured Ek, etc. We're always one top-6 forward injury away from being a 1-line team (whichever line Kaprizov's on).\n\nWe start strong because our coaches understand that we win through effort, not raw skill, and gameplan accordingly.\n\nThe issue is that kind of play isn't sustainable for a full season, let alone adding playoffs. Injuries have wrecked us this year, but it's pretty common for our best guys to be tired by this point in the year.

No, there's nothing he brings that isn't completely overwhelmed by his dipshittery.\n\nIf he can clean up his game, and care the right way enough to put in consistent effort, he can actually be pretty effective. The problem is that he's shown no ability to do both at the same time for any more than a few games in a row for two seasons, now. If it weren't for his contract, he would likely have already been waived. He checks off a lot of boxes of the stereotypes GMs seem to love, but too frequently he fits the \"all the tools, no toolbox\" label.",

After our moves we are a top 10 (or 5) youngest team in the NHL and getting a taste of the intensity and grit the NHL playoffs require would be very important IMO. Especially after the playoffs that Petey had last year. Also Quinn, he can do nothing wrong in my eyes, but the oilers especially were able to silence him a bit with extreme physicality.",
