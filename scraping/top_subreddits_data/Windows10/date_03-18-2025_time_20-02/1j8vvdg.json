I've always kept volume at 80-90% just to have that safe room. It might not be strictly necessary, but it also doesn't really affect quality provided you aren't keeping windows volume at 20% and then just boosting the volume levels after the fact. It also makes lower volumes a bit more practical on an analogue (pot) volume control without everything panning to the extreme left if I want the volume quiet.\n\nThough thankfully this looks like it wasn't some Windows issue, so much as the update triggered some weird state issue with a KVM switcher that simply restarting or replugging the device somehow didn't fix leaving me with a non-existent volume-up key eternally pressed until I booted without it attached and then just reattached it. Still bewildered how any of that persisted across power cycles, but it's gone now.",

I seriously don't want to disconnect, and would rather uninstall from the CLI, but I don't have the full package name this time around to do that with.\n\nYears ago, when I had to remove a KB because it disabled external mice and keyboards, I used the command \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32> dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package\\_for\\_RollupFix\\~31bf3856ad364e35\\~amd64\\~\\~16299.248.1.17\" -- Ideally, I would like to use the same command to remove the current hotfix for Windows 10, so if anyone has the info for the full package name, please let me know.\n\nEdit: corrected KB number (via PS C:\\\\> Get-Hotfix)\n\nEdit 2: I found the way to get the package name:   \n  \nC:\\\\Windows\\\\System32>dism /online /get-packages /format:table\n\nInside the output, I located the full package name: \n\nPackage\\_for\\_ServicingStack\\_5547\\~31bf3856ad364e35\\~amd64\\~\\~19041.5547.1.1\n\nNow I can run the command to remove the package: \n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\System32> dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package\\_for\\_ServicingStack\\_5547\\~31bf3856ad364e35\\~amd64\\~\\~19041.5547.1.1\n\nHope this helps other people also.",
