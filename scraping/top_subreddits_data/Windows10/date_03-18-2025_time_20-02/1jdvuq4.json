    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm planning to buy an NVMe M.2 SSD and install my operating system on it. My computer's hardware isn't strong enough for Windows 11, so I'll be staying with Windows 10 for now.\n\nThe thing is... I already have Windows 10 installed on my old, regular SSD. If I install Windows on the new drive, is there a way to remove Windows from the old SSD **while keeping my important files on it**?\n\nI was thinking of unplugging all my drives (1 SSD, 1 HDD), connecting only the new NVMe, and installing Windows on it. Would I then be able to remove the OS from my old drive while keeping my other files?\n\nor maybe there is a better way to solve this?\n\nSorry for the noob question, but I'm not very experienced with this kind of stuff, so I\u2019d appreciate any advice from those who know more :P",

            "body": "First I agree with the method of installing the new Windows with only the new system drive connected.\n\n\nWhen it comes to later removing the old Windows installation, I would recommend copying the files worth saving over to the new system drive, and then delete all partitions on the old drive. Manually deleting files from an old system drive would recover most of the space, but there will always be some cruft left without reinitializing the drive.\n\n\nEdit: Might also be worth remembering to have any really important files (documents, family photos) also copied to some external storage. Even a cheap and by itself unimpressive USB stick is better than nothing when an accident eventually occurs.\u00a0",

            "body": "I would do is create a new folder right now on the desktop on the old SSD to put all your files in.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter you're done, press Windows+E to open file explorer and go to \"This PC\" on the left. Find the \"C:\" drive (probably named \"Local disk\") and right click on it and go to properties.\n\n\nAdd or change the name at the top to \"Old SSD\" or something similar you'll remember and click \"OK\". You may have to hit \"Continue\" on a box. Now drag the folder you made earlier onto the \"C:\" drive in \"This PC\"\n\n\nUnplug your computer from the wall to remove/unplug the other drives, then plug in and reinstall Windows\n\n\nAfter you're done installing Windows, unplug your computer again to connect the drives then plug back in. After Windows starts, press Windows+E, find the drive \"Old SSD\" in \"This PC\"\n\n\nNow, If you want to properly remove Windows from this drive, you'll need to move the folder you made for your files earlier somewhere on to your new SSD, like the desktop so they DON'T GET ERASED.\nSearch the start menu for \"Disk Management\" and click \"Create or format...\" result\n\n\nYou should see large boxes near the bottom (you may need to maximize the window). Find the row that says \"Old SSD\" and write down the disk number on the left (this is important!).\n\n\nSearch for \"Command Prompt\" in the start menu, right click it, hit \"Run as administrator\" and \"Yes\"\nType \"diskpart\" and press enter\nType \"select disk\", space, the number you wrote down. So if you wrote down \"2\", you'd type \"select disk 2\".\n\n\nPress enter, type \"clean\" and press enter to erase the entire drive.\nType \"create partition primary\" and press enter. Type \"format quick\" and press enter. If the drive isn't appearing in This PC, you may need to type \"assign letter=d\" or another letter that's not being used already.\n\n\nI went to into great detail cause I'm not sure how much of an beginner you are, and hopefully you will be able to figure it out.",
