THEN delete one drive. If you, god help you, use a microsoft based email address but dont pay the 365 extortion fee, you will want to then go delete the backed up files from one drive so it doesnt take up your inbox space, this is best done through the webapp (if you do pay the extortion fee and want to use the 1tb drive space, using the webapp to manually upload things is the only useful way to use one drive.)",

I dont pay for their cloud service so i keep it local and sync it with google drive\n\nAlso you can set it to back up specific local folders rather than hijacking the folders. You do that by setting up the \"sync folders\" option instead of the \"manage backup\" settings",
