    "selftext": "I got a laptop from a relative and I found the windows on it to have a retail licence, so I followed steps to sign into my microsoft account, after which it says \"Windows is activated with digital licence linked to your Microsoft Account\" \n\nNow, I want to flash linux on this pc and change it to that completely, but in the future if I want to get back to windows how is it gonna work for me?\n\nAdditionally, if I happen to sign in with the Microsoft account on another computer which does not have genuine windows, can I rather activate that windows?\n",

You blurred out your partial key so I cannot confirm what you have, but if it is indeed a generic key then you won't be able to transfer the activation. PCs that were upgraded from 7 or 8.1 will display the generic key as it is using digital entitlement instead of the actual key to maintain activation. The generic key will not activate any random computer. \n\nBut regardless, if you want to reinstall Windows on this PC, either it will detect a key in the BIOS and will use that automatically, or if it doesn't you can hit the I don't have a key option, then pick 10 Pro, and it will install that and will reactivate with the digital entitlement.",
