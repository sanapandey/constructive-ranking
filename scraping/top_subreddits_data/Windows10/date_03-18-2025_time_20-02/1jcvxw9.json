What are the pros and cons?\n\nIt also says: Configuarion: Remove apps and files. Do not clean the drive.\nDownload and reinstall Windows\n\nBut if the drive does not get cleaned, then it's not a full factory reset? I want to make sure everything gets deleted because i think i might have spyware.\n\nI would really appreciate if someone could guide me through this. Thank you.",

No files, no settings, no programs, documents, save games etc. will remain.  And if something goes wrong with the licensing (like, it doesn't pick up your motherboard, or you don't have your serial number, or your MS account doesn't have your license - it varies), then you **will** have to phone MS to fix it\n\nAnd certainly I, among others, won't be able to help you with the reinstall",
