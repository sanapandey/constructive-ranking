That would be the EFI partition.\n\n\nI'm guessing you didn't fully delete or remove the drive when you installed Windows on the new drive?\n\n\nWindows reused the existing EFI partition on the old drive instead of making a new one.\n\n\nSo the easiest options are live with it as is. Or disconnect the drive then reinstall Windows wiping the new one to create the proper partitions.",
