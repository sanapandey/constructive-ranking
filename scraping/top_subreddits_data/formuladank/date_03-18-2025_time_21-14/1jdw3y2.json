That lies with the editor/director of whatever show it's being put out on.\n\nYou do have to turn your heart off a bit sometimes, I have shot drivers in floods of tears up to the point a door is slammed in my face or I'm explicitly told by them to stop filming. It's ugly, but that's sports. That's the story, warts and all. And more often than not you can find the good in a horrible situation.",

And certainly, editorialising and spreading conjecture and fake news are morally wrong. But when taking a video, a photo, or an accurately written account, journalist... journal. They document history, which can then be remembered for generations after. That's priceless in its inherent worth to humanity.\n\nIf that cameraperson hadn't done what they did, they wouldn't have captured Anthony Hamilton's heartwarming act of good. Nor would anyone have been able to see the tears and raw emotion of Hadjar there. Both are extremes of the human experience in sport that can't be captured through just videoing battles and crashes in the race.\n\nFor a journalist to fail to record valuable moments at the edges of sporting history because \"Ooh it didn't seem the nicest thing to do at the time\" or because they're afraid of the opinions of sanctimonious keyboard warriors, is to fail at the most basic and important reasons for their existence. You wouldn't ask a woodworker to stop sawing because it's disrespectful to the former tree.\n\nAnd if you think recording emotional bits of history makes them vultures, picking at corpses - maybe that's because YOU'VE written Hadjar off as a corpse, or you think tears are shameful and it makes you uncomfortable to witness his supposed shame. All I see is a young man who cares enough to cry when he messes up in his craft. When was the last time you had such admirable passion?",
