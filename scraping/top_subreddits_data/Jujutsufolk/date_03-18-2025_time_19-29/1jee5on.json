Like making multiple different kinds of metals and using them for specific purposes, and maybe make things with a complex chemical structure, since we know construction can only make simple things, so maybe the six eyes will allow the efficiency for more complex chemical structures.\n\nMai has construction too but she doesn\u2019t have the drive or mental ability to be a sorcerer",

He also doesn't have any techniques that would particularly be boosted by the Six Eyes. It would just further cement his odds over Kenjaku.\n\nThe person with most to gain(other than Gojo); Yorozu. Construction is a CT held back by it's cost and efficiency issues from being the best. Imagine being surrounded by a hundred Perfect Spheres. Instant Top1 for her. Mai would still be useless because she lacks the mindset and drive to be that level.\n\n2nd most to gain; Mechamaru.
