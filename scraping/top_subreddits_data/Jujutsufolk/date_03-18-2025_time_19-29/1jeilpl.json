He even called Todo a sorcerer to his very core. He is quite literally HIM, as deemed by both of the strongest sorcerers in history. (Gojo was also thinking of Todo specifically along with Yuta and Yuji when thinking of how strong the next generation of sorcerers will be)",

            "body": "Partial copy/pasting from a previous comment about Special Grades: People talk like being Special Grade is about being a good fighter. But the sorcerer grading system isn't an objective power system--it's a political system controlled by the higher-ups. The criteria of \"Could they overthrow a nation by themselves?\" is one that prioritizes the relationship of sorcerers to nation-states. JJK explicitly mentions that Special Grade sorcerers can have more restrictions put on them, as demonstrated by the attempt to designate Yaga a Special Grade post-Shibuya so they can restrict him. (It is also the case that with the Special Grades we see, it is either very hard [Yuta, Gojo] or would have potentially mass destructive consequences [Geto, Tsukumo] to kill them.) \n\nSo with that in mind, the question is to what degree the higher-ups would consider Todo a threat. Boogie Woogie is a very good technique for combat, and it could possibly cause havoc by swapping key sorcerers and cursed objects. But it's not super destructive the same way Gojo could be. Politically, it seems that Todo doesn't engage with the governance structures of the jujutsu world much. When he nominates the Tokyo students for promotion, it's clear he didn't know the rules of the process. He also refuses Gakuganji's order to kill Yuji at the Goodwill Games. So he's willing to defy them. But not out of a critique of the power structure, more because he only cares for battle. I think under these circumstances, the higher ups would consider the potential benefits of designating Todo a Special Grade lesser than the cost of making him more famous and lauded and paying him a Special Grade salary.",
