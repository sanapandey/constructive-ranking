I feel like it would have better if he completely stop doing the \"hype! the good guys are doing something\", since it's quickly followed with \"so anyway Sukuna slap that shit\".\n\nLike the Todo + Yuji wombo combo happening, making it seem like we are reaching the climax, then Sukuna was going to use his DE, only to see Gojo's shadow (I think this was the sequence doesn't matter because of what happens next chapter). That's DOPE and all, but the next chapter Sukuna bitch slap Todo and Yuji so nonchalantly lmao. I get that Sukuna is meant to be way above them, but maybe don't try to flipflop it. Make it just seem like Sukuna is really just bitch slapping this fools.",

It's before the domain clash, Gege put a lot of emphasis on the previous chapter on how Sukuna JUST couldn't keep up. And all of a sudden he just bitch slap them both (it was just Yuji) out of there lol.\n\nedit: Let me actually reread that part. But first read, it made me legitimately laugh because of how silly it looks.\n\nedit 2: Yep, it still looks silly. It might just be me, but the way Yuji made Sukuna bleed (I'm heavily underrating how amazing their combo was) only for Sukuna to backhand him is fucking hilarious lol",
