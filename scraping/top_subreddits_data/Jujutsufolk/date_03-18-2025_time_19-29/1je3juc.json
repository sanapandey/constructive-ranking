Assuming we should fill all 5 roles, and we choose characters by how they will handle their roles, Gojo is like 100% first pick as a main carry, and even though Sukuna is still the greatest in terms of durability, I think that we shouldn't consider his AP in this draft (let's just say that he scales insanely high with some damage build, but we're using him as a tank, so he can't just be a tank one-shotting boss with Fuga or WCS)  so I believe that having either Kenjaku or Yuki as our trump card would be better. Kashimo and Uro for 4 bucks in total is just a bargain, and we're getting either Panda or Todo as a tank, depending on who we're choosing between Kenjaku and Yuki. Panda is a very decent tank for just 1 dollar, Todo is worse, but his CT is busted in a 5-man lobby, so, I guess, I take Todo and Yuki.\n\nFinal pick: Todo, Kashimo, Uro, Gojo and Yuki.\n\nUPD: wait, I just thought about that, and realized that Boogie Woogie will become like 100x stronger with CSM, so I wanna replace Uro with Arata. He is leagues weaker than Uro, but I think that having Kenjaku with Todo together is worth it.",

His physical capabilities do not get enough love, being at the very least relative Yuta and Yuji in terms of speed and strength. His durability, hence probably why he is in Tank, is absurd, surviving one of Sukuna's black flashes. Lastly, he's a genius, outsmarting EVERY foe he meets, and these guys are some of the smartest in the series!\n\nYuji is a similar case as Todo, though in terms of being a Tank, ranged/magic (with techniques), and while card. If his durability wasn't enough, he also has barrier techniques and healing factors, which makes him last even longer somehow. His strength and speed are akin to that of Maki and Yuta, making him absolutely busted, and is more durable than either. While he may seem stupid, he's anything but: he's a prodigy with an insanely adaptability in strategy, always keeping up with the plans of some of the series best strategists without even needing to consult them prior, especially Todo; like Todo, he's capable of also outsmarting several of the series smartest as well, like Mahito.\n\nYuta is one of the best domain expansion users of the series and has a wide range of different techniques and tools, including Angel's technique. It may just be a 5 minute time-limit but with how much he could use it and the fact his domain expansion essentially bypasses this binding vow it is worth it. Even without it he's one of the most physically capable and, like the others, a brilliant strategist and observer. He's also a healer.\n\nLastly may be Gojo. Again, I could go with any of the other $5, but: Gojo is one of the strongest, essentially equal to Sukuna; is arguably the most precise sorcerer in terms of using CE; like the others, a combat genius and overall genius; while not nearly as good as Yuta or Kenjaku's manipulation of domains, is very talented and is good enough of fit, and can tank most damage from those that give off physical damage; has one of the few one-shot techniques that isn't a domain expansion, others being Yuta's Love Beam and Sukuna's World Cutting Slash (though like those others, it takes time to prepare); can determine an enemy's technique at a literal glance.",

He assists in the tank role and will be very useful in keeping the Demon King from doing real damage while his own damage. Paired with Todo in the same party, sure will be fun. \n\nMagic/Ranged, Gojo is the same deal. He's simply so strong and his Limitless can keep him safe. He's too good at damage output to skip.
