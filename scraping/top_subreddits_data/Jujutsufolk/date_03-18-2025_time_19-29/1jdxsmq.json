Maybe you\u2019re right. \n\nI always thought Geto was referring to Yuta\u2019s use of RCT, as we observed him stabilize Maki/panda just a few frames earlier. As if geto was saying \u201cit\u2019s better to let you use up a lot of CE so you run out faster, so go ahead do your thing I\u2019ll be here waiting.\u201d Not knowing ofc until after just how much CE Yuta actually has. \n\nBut also reinforcing Inumaki\u2019s curse with his own CE may have been enough as a special grade to not crush himself and stay alive. He doesn\u2019t necessarily need RCT so that may be another explanation to OPs question.",
