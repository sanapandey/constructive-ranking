    "selftext": "Happy Friday! We\u2019re making some important announcement so let me get this straight, I know you guys have noticed the rising number of bots\u2014 we do, too! And they\u2019re so annoying.\n\nReddit automatically detects them but some of them can\u2019t be filtered. Thus, we had to manually get rid of the bots by permanently banning them. If you guys see any of them in the comments, please report them because they contribute nothing to our subreddit. \n\nHere are the things we\u2019ve noticed among bots as of this writing:\n\n1. Majority of them made their accounts in January 2025. Some of them had accounts since October 2024 but it\u2019s a rare case.\n\n2. Their usernames are based on \u201creal\u201d people\u2019s names. \n\n3. Their comments are like, \u201cNo jumping, (blah blah blah)\u201d and it\u2019s completely irrelevant to the main post.\n\n4. However, they now also know some of the lores in JJK or mention JJK character names like \u201cNope, RCT doesn\u2019t fix crusty feet!\u201d or \u201cGojo was a robot in Shibuya!\u201d or \u201cHe only has feelings for Tsumiki!\u201d And those statements frequently end in exclamation point (!).\n\n5. They don\u2019t respond if you replied to their botted comments. \n\n6. They make puns that don't make sense at all like \"open domain boofed\", \"Gojo goofed\", or \"This makes me feel like a happy potato.\" \n\n7. Their grammar is between being too robotic or can't properly communicate at all. They have a hard time in phrasing or words. \n\n8. They do comment and appear under new or hot posts real quick using the criteria we've mentioned so far.\n\n9. If you check their profile, they usually have low karma points (for getting downvoted) and almost post the same phrases with a bit of alteration.\n\n10. They don't have posts yet, they just comment under someone else's posts.\n\nWhy are we just posting this now? We\u2019ve waited if they would get lost but they are still around here even few weeks later.\n\nTL;DR (because we are JJK fans): **Feel free to report the bots so they can appear in the queue for us to ban them as quick as we can considering not all of them can be filtered by Reddit so Jujutsufolk mod team will do its own power.**\n\nIf you\u2019ve got this far, thank you for reading and if you have suggestions or violent reactions, please let us know.\n",
