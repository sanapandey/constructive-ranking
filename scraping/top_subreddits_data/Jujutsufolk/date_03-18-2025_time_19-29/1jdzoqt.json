    "selftext": "At the moment many people seem to talk about how kenjaku's gravity technique seems so out of the blue. \n\nAnd here i am reminded of shibuya when the prison realm was pulled to the ground from kenjaku's hand.\n\nKenjaku said the pr needed time to process gojo but what if he was lying? \n\nWhat if he used rct through anti gravity technique to stick the pr to the ground so he would have a reason to remain there while the curses went and got defeated only for him to show up then and absorb them easily, like mahito!\n\nI believe this is what happened, and gege wanted to keep the mystery on the gravity technique but also provided this detail so people will later come back here and say: oh so that was that...

Kenjaku doesn't have friends, everything is a tool for him. The curses were ammunition to use against gojo. Kenjaku was never on the front lines. We see jogo angry at him, as well as mahito feeling skeptical. And most importantly with the disaster curses front stage, no one guessed a human (kenjaku before he revealed his technique) aligning with curses. I don't think sorcerers expected kenjaku being the mastermind behind the alliance and their plans. \n\nKenjaku didn't want to abosrb mahito until he evolved more. We see during the mechamaru vs mahito fight, kenjaku almost absorbs mahito there. Mahito hasn't evolved enough yet in the mechamaru fight and so kenjaku holds steady instead. Instead he gets a super evolved but fatigued mahito to abosrb after the yuji fight.",

Gege may have intended some parts of the manga through subtlety, but it's definitely not the case here, and if so, its just terrible execution of a foreshadowing by all accounts.",

No direct mention it was Kenjaku at the moment, no insinuation it was Kenjaku aside from a vague stare Mahito gave him that wasn\u2019t properly adapted in the anime. There wasn\u2019t any other explanation as to how this could happen until then, as per the worldbuilding. We haven\u2019t even learned until the Yuki fight he had access to other techniques as well.

I remember lots of people discussing this exact concept back when the discussion threads on discord were almost difficult to follow because they were so active. I used to be way more convinced this was what Gege meant to convey here, but over time it feels less and less convincing. Even with Gege\u2019s somewhat poor narrative writing style, I think it would have been a little more obvious from this scene that Kenjaku was bluffing here. Showing the subsequent pages, especially the interaction between him and Mahito, would support your claims in the post a lot more. Mahito def realized Kenjaku was especially up to not good, even though he already knew that of course.",

The fact that mahito says later that he knew that kenjaku would betray them brings further evidence to that.\n\nMoreover, unlike the anime, the manga portrayed it differently. Once gojo is sealed, the prison realm becomes small and has its eyes closed. Once the prison realm becomes heavy, the eyes open up. The anime made it cry and other stuff, but the manga just has the eyes open. Both of then would imply that the eyes signify that the prison realm is processing gojo. However, in chapter 136 kenjaku shows the prison realm to the crew and it still has open eyes. This means that the eyes don't signify the prison realm processing gojo, they are just a visual representation of somebody being sealed inside. For the anime you could argue that the crying is what signals the processing, but there's no such thing in the manga.\n\nI personally have only one issue with the theory, which is the spark argument. Jogo, dagon, choso and mahito would have felt kenjaku's spark. The only possible explanation to this is that due to kenjaku using the prison realm, his residuals are all over it so the technique usage could be masked (kinda similar to how kenjaku masked the mini uzumaki spark by the curse getting exorcised).",
