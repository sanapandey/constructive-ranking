Yuji is cracking ozawa \n4. Yuji is cracking nobara \n5. Yuji is cracking maki (cuz fuck yuta)\n6. Yuji is not GAY (i shouldn't have entered Twitter man, they be shipping yuji with anyone but the girls) \n7. He is the new head of the kamo clan (honestly what's the point of this clan again? you know it's sorry ahh clan if noritoshi is the strongest member in it)\n8. Kenjaku is still alive (setting up for new series like jjk 2)\n9. Megumi having both shrine and the 10 shadows (he's not beating *potential man allegations* anytime soon)",

It's never totally satisfying.\n\nIt's even worse when fan theories and speculation get a lot of traction and get back to the author only for the author to be like \"the hell are you talking about lmao\".\n\nThey're only fun when they're about silly inconsequential stuff, like how a character would act in a hypothetical situation or their likes and dislikes, silly stuff.
