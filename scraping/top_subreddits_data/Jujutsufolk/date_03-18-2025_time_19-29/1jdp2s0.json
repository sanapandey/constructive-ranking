So it either makes thing have 0 gravity no matter what, or -1 gravity. Let's take Gojo for example. He has Limitless as his technique, Blue being his Lapse, and Red being his Reversal. In theory, Limitless is 0, Blue is 1, and Red -1. So I think Anti-Gravity works as a -1, it's a direct oppost of the CTR, inverting the gravity around him.",
