    "selftext": "It annoys me to NO END when I see \"sad stardew valley facts\" videos and they're like \"when you marry your spouse, it ruins their life :(((( they don't follow their dreams :((((((\" MOST OF THEM DO. YOU JUST MARRIED ABIGAIL, ALEX, OR SHANE.\n\nI'm sorry you married the girl who just got out of her teens and doesn't know what she's going to do with her life. I'm sorry you rushed an alcoholic who didn't need a romantic relationship into marriage. I'm sorry you married Alex. But can we stop spreading the \"marriage ruins lives\" narrative?\n\nLeah still sculpts. Haley still does photography (plus I think she's happy to be a stay at home wife/mother). Penny still teaches Jaz and Vincent (and again she's happy being stay at home especially with her own kids). Maru still does science stuff or whatever and she still has her part time job at the clinic. Emily still does her Emily things and still works at the Saloon. Harvey is still the town doctor. Sebastian still codes and he now lives at a comfortable distance away from his family which is what he wanted. Sam is still pursuing music, albeit not in the way he expected. And do I even need to mention Elliott, who is THRIVING after marriage?? His 14 heart event is literally >!him leaving for a week to do book signings!<???????\n\n\"But their schedule changes and they don't go out as much!\" Honestly?? Boo-hoo. You naturally become more busy once you're married, especially if you're a homemaker. While you're out on the farm, they're inside taking care of the house/your children. Plus, the farm is kinda far away from town by npc walking speed standards, so it's not as worth it to go into town everyday. This is normal. This happens in most marriages. \n\nTldr can we please stop saying that marriage ruins the spouses lives bc for a majority of them it doesn't \n\nedit: Shane gets better after having a good friend. his arc is pretty much done by his 8 heart event. marrying him only adds a romantic relationship on top of everything he was dealing with (bc okay requires management) and adding a relationship while he's recovering I think causes him to regress, if just slightly. that's why I say Shane is part of the \"\"\"\"ruined\"\"\"\" category.\n\nedit 2: for everyone saying \"it's just a game who cares\" thats not the point?? these are characters people care about and want to discuss.",

He's perfectly happy hanging around Pelican Town, making sure his grandparents are okay, and helping out on the farm. He even says he's really happy, and that he's happy to be giving your kids the childhood he never got to have. He's *just fine* after marrying the farmer.",

                    "body": "Marriage and moving onto the farm is actually an extremely important part of Alex's character arc and it is honestly incomplete without it. Gridball was a proxy; he craved love but Evelyn could not relate to him and George admits he can't connect to him. He lost his mother and his father taught him he was unlovable out of jealousy for having the youth he himself had wasted. Alex responds to this with ambition to make the most of his youth in a way that would make people love him, i.e. achieve pro status in a sport that you can only play professionally when you're young, to get fans who will parasocially like him. He doesn't know how to connect with anyone so he is seeking a material achievement that he can aspire to, that he can earn through physical effort rather than the social effort he was never taught the tools for. He only talks about Gridball because he views that as his opportunity for connection. And it can be, but not in the way he's trying to.\n\nIn comes the farmer, and Alex struggles with wanting to connect to them, but not knowing how. He opens up about his dog, about his mom, and as he does the farmer is still there, still his friend. They connect on a deeper level, and Alex realizes he does not need to aspire to a career accomplishment to feel fulfilled, he does not need to earn love through achievement, he can earn it by opening himself up to it, and people will love him as he is. As you get further into his heart events he seems to lose his passion for Gridball because that passion was misdirected to begin with. It was an avenue to connection and affection that he no longer views as a viable path for what he actually wants. He talks about a wider variety of things because he no longer needs the Gridball hammer for every social nail.\n\nIt is when you marry Alex and he begins to contribute to life on the farm that he really, finally understands what he was missing, because he is no longer missing it. You didn't steal him away from Gridball, you *saved* him from a shallow and unfulfilling life chasing something he could never get the way he was trying to get it.\n\nHis 14 heart event is the most important one of any bachelor, because without this 14 heart event Alex's arc is never conclusively finished. This is where he finds love and connection outside of the farmer, where he finally makes an active decision of his own accord to get what he wants the right way, with his love for the game of Gridball still being a part of it, but in a way that lets him foster genuine social connections rather than parasocial ones. But the most important part comes with George, who spent Alex's arc unable to connect to Alex due to his age and disability. This was the same anxiety that Alex's father felt that led to his abuse of Alex, and although George did not abuse Alex, this surely did not escape his notice and it probably further hindered their connection for George to remain a constant reminder of Alex's self-perceived inadequacies. But in this heart event George says he \"feels young again.\" Alex has managed to foster a true connection with George, and in doing so George is able to vicariously feel the youth that Alex was so resented for. This is proof to Alex that his father was the problem, that his bitterness over lost youth was his own making, because by connecting genuinely with his son he would have been able to feel young again. He was holding himself back, not Alex. His 14-heart event is where Alex finally defeats his father. To me, there is no true happy ending for him without this. It is essential.\n\n**Edit:** This comment has gotten more votes and replies than I was expecting, so I want to take advantage of that visibility and shout out Fiona Sangster and her eponymous YouTube channel on the off chance you haven\u2019t heard of her. She has video essays about almost every Stardew bachelor and bachelorette, and they are brilliant. Even though her analysis of him does not bring up some of what I referenced in this comment, I consider her essay about Alex to be the definitive analysis of his story. And I believe the Alex video was the first video she ever made, so you can imagine how great the others are!",

I strongly support player-sexual characters in games with romance options). Just because of how his romance is written, Alex is the only bachelor I am convinced must have been conceived as gay originally. But it would not take much for me to be persuaded that Haley and/or Leah were as well.",

She\u2019s thriving away from her parents, spreading her wings, getting to do the mining and adventuring she always wanted, still playing music, and going out to socialize and play at the arcade and visit her family on a regular basis. Presumably she\u2019s just as able to do her online classes just as well from the farmhouse as she did at home. I think she\u2019s one of the ones that marriage does best for.\n\n(Honestly Elliott felt more stifled to me. I know writing is an at-home job, but apart from the book tour event he literally only leaves the farm to go stand outside his empty cabin once a week. Like, my dude, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy on the farm, but \u2013 speaking as one writer inclined to be a homebody to another \u2013 that level of isolation cannot be healthy. Your spouse should not be the be-all and end-all of your social life. Please socialize a bit, or take walks around the valley for inspiration or *something*.)",

Like, how do you manage to marry sebastian without realizing that \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\nThey kept complaining that he would ask for alone time and would disappear from time to time, and like, yeah, there's an entire cut-scene where he tells you WHERE he runs off to(the clifside that shows the city) and he's an introvert, of corse he wants alone time!\n\nAnd it's plainly obvious those people gave up talking to him and giving him gifts after they married him, some people even admitted they were giving gifts to other villagers after marrying, like obviously he's gonna be upset, that's how they're coded smh\n\n(Sorry for the rant i just love sebastian)",

Yes, you still are your own person and you still get to see your friends and you still get to do your hobbies and you can still follow your dreams, but at the same time, your life is now intertwined with another person's life who also is their own person, and has their friends, dreams, hobbies, needs etc and yours and theirs will not always align, therefore you need to make certain choices and compromises:) and that might not always go YOUR way, because a relationship is not about just you, it's about both of you.\n\nGoing back to SDV; your spose literally keeps doing their stuff.

Moving to the farm gives him that distance, and he's STILL free to go into town literally any time he wants. Also. I'm a guy, so I play as a guy. Which means adoption for me and him, so for my personal play through I know off a fact that he's happy with the kids and being there for them. BECAUSE HE SUGGESTED GETTING THEM. I've never liked this whole \"you ruin your spouse's life!!\" Thing. I'm sure it's just a joke on some level, but it's also always kinda felt disrespectful??? Like. Why would concernedape just purposely do that? OH ANOTHER THING. Sebastian loves frogs and we literally take in frogs for his heart event. SERIOUSLY THIS MAN IS VERY HAPPY WITH MARRIED LIFE. HE GETS TO CODE, I RESPECT HIS WORK, HE GETS TO BE A HERMIT, HE STILL HANGS OUT WITH SAM AND ABIGAIL. HOW DID I RUIN HIS LIFE??????? Sure he's not in the city, but I personally don't think it was ever actually *about* the city. It was about a new environment where he could grow and not be cramped by his family. Feel more free.

In his 14 heart event!!! He goes outside and reads. He happily takes care of the children with or without you. He has a warm home, a real home that he can really make his own. Hell, he goes on and tells you how happy he is with you, how much he loves you, and sometimes to show how much he loves and appreciates you in his life, he helps around the farm or makes breakfast, etc. (I just love how much of a romantic he is \u2661\u2661\u2661) Honestly, from his subtext and heart events, we really do make his life better. How is that ruining him by wanting to marry him?\n\nAnd ik op mentioned many other characters, I just haven't married any of them, but from all of their heart events before marriage, we are a positive inclusion in most of these characters' lives. Marriage is just another step to one who you like the most, and frankly I think it's wonderful.\n\nI try to ignore those \"Sad Stardew Valley Facts\" lists. Im more sad for the people posting it who feel marriage ruined these characters. You don't have to marry them, you can still help Shane and be his friend, you can still be friends with Alex, and Abigail, and Sebastian, and Elliott, and whomever else if that's how you want to play. No one is making these posters marry any of these characters. :/",

He uses big words, but honestly, when I look around his shack and talk to him in the vanilla game.. he gives me the impression he has depression. \n\nAs someone also deals with it, who does does character designs, I also deal with constantly starting and scrapping ideas. Dealing with my environment not being the best, but I can't do anything about it financially. Going out and talking or just existing around people to try to find that spark of motivation again. Eating out more than I should if I eat at all because I just struggle trying to cook for myself most days. Wanting people in my space, but also being embarrassed by the state of it, even if it isn't that bad because it could be better. Wanting my home to be homely for people I care about even when it's hard. \nThe quotes that get me are, >!\"Sometimes I wonder if I might just have an inflated self-image and no real skills... No, no... I'm not fishing for compliments. Though they are appreciated...\"!< 6 heart quote\nand >!\"It's a little lonely out here on the beach... so I apologize if I was ever a little too forward with you when we first met. I was just eager to have a friend. It feels good to have a close friend like you.\"!< 8 heart quote\n\nI understand those feelings! Like you're never going to be enough as you are. That those skills you took years to get to where you are now are never enough, and you are just inflating yourself to feel better about your inadequacies. Not wanting compliments, but reassurance that you aren't a fraud or just you're really someone who people want to be around. Feeling so lonely that you become too much when you're around someone new because you crave and NEED that connection! \n\nI love how even when he still has his insecurities, he knows he has you, the farmer, to fall back on. And you aren't going anywhere. You want him to do best by him... and he makes it work. Those thoughts and ideas of your own self are still going to be there, but they're quieter now that you have that. And marrying him, he shows it in both small and grandiose ways to show how much you've made his life better. And I just know that in his shoes, I'd do the same.\n\nEdited to spoiler quotes",
