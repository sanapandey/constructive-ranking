If you jump on them they give you a slight upwards push, so you have to time a jump so you come down at the end of your jump on the barrier so you have enough speed that the upwards push doesn't slow you down that much. If you do a short hop and hit the barrier at the start or middle of your jump, it might push you up and you'll float off the edge and not be able to jump again. In this case the barrier isn't right at the edge, so a short hop might work, but sometimes it is right at the edge \ud83d\ude2d. Try practicing this on the earlier levels.\nOption 2. You can actually pass the finish line underneath. It only tracks your horizontal position. You could have waited and long jumped at the last moment before the barrier. You wouldn't have made it onto the final platform, but you might have made it past the finish long which is all that matters. Same thing works for checkpoints in the normal mode.",
