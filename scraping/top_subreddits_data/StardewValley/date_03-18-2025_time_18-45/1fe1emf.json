Check out our [list of removed topics here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/removed_topics)\n\n* **\n\n\n# Game updates\n* **What was in the last update?**  \n  See release notes [for PC](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History), [for consoles](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Console_Version_History), and [for mobile](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mobile_Version_History).\n\n   See also a table of [which version and features each platform has](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley#Current_versions).\n\n* **Are future releases planned?**  \nStardew Valley 1.6.9 released on 4 November 2024 on PC, console and mobile. A full list of changes in this update can be viewed [here](https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/). No major new releases are currently planned.\n\n* **Does every platform get the same content/updates?**  \n  Mostly yes. Updates are developed for Linux/Mac/Windows first, then ported to other platforms. There are customizations for each platform (like tap to move on mobile), but otherwise content is identical across all platforms. See also a table of [which version and features each platform has](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley#Current_versions).\n\n  The exceptions are PS Vita (which won't get any further content updates [due to platform limitations](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1232797409010278400)), and Android/iOS (which will continue getting all updates, but [doesn't fully support multiplayer](https://www.stardewvalley.net/mobile-multiplayer-guide/).\n\n* **Is Stardew Valley on XBox GamePass?**\n\n     Stardew Valley is on XBox GamePass as of December 2, 2021. See [here](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/12/01/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-december-2021/) for details.\n\n# Multiplayer\n* **How does multiplayer work?**  \n  See [Multiplayer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Multiplayer) on the wiki.\n\n* **Is crossplay supported?**  \n   All PC players can play together, whether they're on Linux/Mac/Windows or GOG/Steam and crossplay is supported between mobile and PC. [Console crossplay isn't supported](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1036993838613651459).\n\n* **Is split-screen supported?**  \n  Yep, split-screen was added on PC and console in Stardew Valley 1.5.\n\n* **Will Android/iOS get multiplayer?**  \n  Multiplayer on Android and iOS is currently experimental and hidden by default. To unlock multiplayer you can follow this [guide](https://www.stardewvalley.net/mobile-multiplayer-guide/). Note: The Apple Arcade version (Stardew Valley+) does not have this feature.\n\n* **Will the 1.6 update apply to my current game?**  \n  Yes! New updates always apply to existing saves.\n\n# Other\n* **Can I transfer saves between devices?**  \n   You can [transfer saves](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves#Transfer_a_save) between Android, iOS, and PC (Linux/Mac/Windows).\n\n   Consoles unfortunately don't let you access the save files. The Switch version also has a different format that's not compatible with other platforms (the format used by other consoles is unknown).\n   \n* **My save got corrupted/won't load. What can I do?**  \n   On PC/mobile you can try loading your back-up save file! See [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves#Troubleshooting) for instructions on how to do so!\n   \n   Unfortunately, consoles don't allow access to save files so they cannot be recovered.\n\n* **How do I take a screenshot of my full farm?**  \n  See [this guide to taking farm screenshots](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/how-to-share-your-farm-and-use-stardew-planner.152/).\n\n* **If I buy the game on one platform, can I get it for free on a different one?**  \n   If you buy it on PC, you get the Linux + macOS + Windows versions; if you buy it on PS4, you get the PS4 + PS Vita versions. Otherwise each platform is a different edition with separate development, so you'll need to buy it again if you want it on a different platform.\n\n* **Where can I report bugs?**  \n  1. If you use mods, see the [troubleshooting guide](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Troubleshooting) first.\n  2. If you use mods and the bug disappears when playing without them (by running `Stardew Valley.exe` directly in [your game folder](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_folder)), report it to r/SMAPI or see [Modding:Help](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Help).\n  2. If it happens without mods, report it in the official [bug report forum](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports.12/), which the game developers keep an eye on.\n\n* **How do I use or create mods?**  \n   See the pinned thread in r/SMAPI for more info, and feel free to ask questions in r/SMAPI!",

I feel like I never have any time to do things in my days before I run out of food or energy. I'm overwhelmed by all the things I could do, and I find myself wandering around and before I know it the day is over and I did not really do anything. \n\nI'd like to watch someone else play a full spring to understand how they plan a day out. \n\nA lot of the videos I've seen are either sped up summaries of what they did in a day (and it always feels like it's way more than I can do) or the series is from someone new to the game so they are just as confused as me.",

Dont forget about the spring onion in the south of cindersap, and dont discount hoarding algae or seaweed if you end up with a lot of that. Make sure to max out your foraging time when salmonberries  (and blackberries) are in season - you can easily end up with a year's worth of energy.   \nFrom there, if you want money go fishing. If you need resources, clear your farm (make sure to use the scythe when clearing weeds since it doesnt take energy).    \nLimit your actual farming to 15 plot or so, accidentally planting too much is the energy killer. That first spring you can max out at around 30, but thatll take about all your energy.    \nThat's what I usually do, and I keep accidentally almost completing the community center year 1 (that year 2 red cabbage always gets me though).  \nMy first week or so of spring I usually go to bed around 3pm or so, so that's not a bad thing. You CAN only forage so much before theres just nothing left to pick up, people to talk to, and garbage to rummage through. Once you have your first harvest of parsnips and things though, it'll start to pick up significantly.",

Especially salmonberry season because by blackberry season you can start getting other energy sources online/can probably afford to just buy energy from Gus. I also personally like picking mushroom cave and eating the common mushrooms while selling the others, but that's a more controversial pick.\n\nIn general, if you got the spring only community center stuff done, you're doing well. Hyper optimal people can do that while also setting up huge sprinkler fields, getting max fishing, killing it with relationships, and preparing to explode with artisan, but if you're on pace for year 1 or early year 2 community center (damn you pigs/red cabbage), you're doing well and can easily ramp up anything you feel like ramping up.",

Year 1 Community Center requires a lot of ducks in a row unless you get really lucky with Travelling Cart, and even that requires remembering to check cart every Friday and Sunday. And the liquidity to actually buy what's in there when something good drops.",

Spring Foraging because it's easy. Spring Crops because that bundle set repairs your Greenhouse, which you do want by Winter 1, and Boiler Room because it repairs the minecarts which make travelling throughout the valley much more convenient. \n\nYou can essentially flowchart your days based on your daily luck (the fortune teller on TV) and the weather.\n\nBad or Neutral Luck sunny day? Water your crops, then forage or fish the mountain lake.\n\nGood Luck sunny day? Water your crops then go try and get 5-10 levels deeper into the mine.\n\nBad or Neutral Luck rainy day? Fish the river.\n\nGood Luck rainy day? Try for 10-15 levels of the mines with the extra time you have from not watering your crops.\n\nIf you fish a decent amount you'll have green algae to keep your energy up, there's also dandelions, leeks, spring onions, and salmonberries to forage. You can also keep some of your crops, or buy Salads from Gus, or buy Trout Soup from Willy if fishing is taking most of your energy since it gives a buff. It's not too big of a deal to run out of energy and call it a day though, unless you're almost at an elevator level of the mines.",

Every seasons theres at least 1 super tough but common fish in every body of water, but you can kinda alternate which body of water it is per season. I dont really remember since... ya know... max it out year 1, but generally the mountain pond is pretty safe. It's mostly gonna be carp, chub, and largemouth bass (sturgeon, walleye, and lingcod are all the tough fish you have to worry about but walleye needs rain and lingcod is only during winter so...).

It gets easier once you start getting people maxed, since maxed friendships don't decay for anyone but your spouse. For the likes, in the social tab menu there's a list of all the NPCs and if you click on any of them it'll show you a log of all types of gifts you've given them, categorized by loved/liked/neutral etc. so once you've given them a gift they like you can come back to check what it was. For schedules, it mostly comes down to memory, but the wiki lists the different schedules of all NPCs. Give it a check if you feel like you never run into a particular NPC.\n\n3.

It is one of the hardest parts of the game at first for sure, one of the easier and more stress free ways I found was using fruits from fruit trees and just gifting them to villagers that I pass by. These are something called universal likes, meaning that any villager will like this as a gift and will gain positive friendship. Gifting on birthdays too will give even bigger bonuses, they can easily be checked through the calendar by Pierre's Shop. Friendship decays slowly too (-2 points per day) and talking to a villager gives +20 points so even rare interactions can make sure it climbs even a little :)\n\n3.

Especially cheese. I upgraded the barn and coop, and then immediately got the basement + casks to age the cheese. I did get lucky with an early Ancient Seed spawn, and fished a lot for immediate money cuz i love the fishing minigame. I got fish smokers, mushroom logs, and dehydrators early as well. Dehydrating all the classic money making fruit (melons, strawberries, starfruit, rhubarb, etc) is a good mid game money maker when you cant make a ton of wine or age it yet as well. With Artisan, dehydrated ancient fruit sells for 5,810g. Iridium aged ancient fruit wine sells for 4,620g. When I could I started making Starfruit/Ancient Fruit wine and aging it to silver and selling it, since it's still more profitable for the work/time BUT dehydrating fruit, mushrooms, and getting early animal goods is key I think.  \nI did have a lot of good RNG - my only chokehold for the CC was red cabbage otherwise I would have completed it year 1 and i wasnt even TRYING to do that - but the dehydrators and an ideal mushroom log set up really are key for lots of early and mid game money I think.",

Have 20 or so crystalriuams running and collect em 3 times a day, you want 100+ bombs. You can buy some from the Dwarf as well, but it's expensive.   \nDo the same thing for Jade, and staircases (but you can only trade them on sundays). Skip any floors that are infested, dont have a lot of rocks, or are kind of annoying to navigate.  \nSpicy eel is a good choice, because it gives speed and luck AND you can also trade them for Rubies at the desert trader (1 for 1, any day). Double shot espresso or ginger ale is good in combination as well. For healing (until you get the fairy box trinket or a lot of spicy eel), gold star cheese or salad bought from Gus.  \nUntil you get the galaxy sword, focus more on getting down/ores than attacking enemies.  You wont get very far at first but hopefully you'll get your first prismatic shard and it only gets easier from there. There are a few other ways to get them, though.  \nWhenever they pop up always take a shaft, instead of the ladder - they drop you multiple floors, usually 3-15. Even only getting dropped like 3 or 4 levels saves you a ton of time.\n  \nOnce you get the hang of it, and get more shards, you can trade 3 of them for a magic rock candy on thursday at the desert trader. You WANT these whenever you can acquire them - theres a few sources, including the raccoon shop. In fact, you get one for donating a bunch of stuff from the museum. You can use this one to, hopefully, get deep enough to get plenty of ore and more shards.  \n  \nYou gotta go on a best luck day, as well.  \n  \nAny questions lol? My qualifications is i collect 300+ ore, IF i take it lazy. But my record is 700 iridium ore at once.",

Well, now my question is: should I make ANOTHER save file to experience 1.6? Is there really THAT much content added early game that I would miss out if I kept going with my 1.5 save file?\n\nNote: I haven't played at all in like over a year, so it might be best to start an entirely new game anyway.\u00a0",

The worst part for me is not knowing exactly what you're missing, or forgetting which mod adds what and having to go reverse-hunting the missing items on the nexus pages.

You can easily rename the folder to 'old mods' or something, or can just put a dot (.mods) in front of the word so SMAPI won't recognise it. It's a bit clunky but does work.  \n\nYou can use a mod manager. The one designed specially for Stardew Valley's mods is called Stardrop. Within that you can set different profiles - choose which mod for which 'game', or none at all for a particular game profile.  \n\nStardrop = https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10455  \n\nHow to use = https://floogen.gitbook.io/stardrop  \n\nThirdly you can use the way suggested in the wiki, which is here:-  \n\n\nhttps://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started#Can_I_have_different_mod_groups.3F",

A bigger field = more chances.  \nI know it's possible on Switch because I've done it before, it's just kinda rare unless you do leave the crops for a little while (and most of the time as soon as something is ready you pick it).",

This can give around 5000-6000 from full day of fishing when getting golden/iridium fish... but fishing is situational, mostly used early on for early income and energy food while mid-summer your farm should overtake it with regular profits, while you focus on harvesting resources, leveling your other skills.\n\nFor meadows farm I would say you should go full on chickens. Build a silo, stock on hay, then start building a line of coops on the edge of grassland (left side of the map) with grass growing on the tillable soil below the coops. I would say upgrading the coop once is handy so you could hatch your own chickens as well (+other animals options, chances for void chickens or dinosaurs). Early on you can upgrade one, but overall you will want to upgrade all coops with time to max size.\n\nConvert the eggs into may and sell. Same as with crops you have to re-invest early on to increase the chicken count. One chicken per week will give 1995 - 2793 gold which is meh but 10 chickens will give up 27 930 weekly which is getting nice.\n\nThere are animals that produce more gold per day but to grow their population you will need a lot of gold, wood and stone. Coops are bit cheaper, chickens are the cheapest while not the worst money maker and you can grow their population year one and start adding barns year 2+ and filling them with pig and/or ostrich or sheep.. or stay to coop and mostly chickens with a mix of other animals for side products. Some people do thematic builds that still give more than enough income.\n\nCoops/Barns and especially their upgrades will require quite a lot of wood and stone. Stone is relatively easy to come by from the mines if you are active there, but overall year one wood and to some extent stone is very cheap from Robin. The farm itself has a lot of trees so you should be good for at least few buildings.",

Once I have upgraded all cabins fully, these accounts will never be played anymore. __When I play with my main character, will it be like a solo game as in the clock stops when doing certain stuff (like opening inventory) or will the clock never stop anymore?__ If it never stops, I might be reluctant to upgrade the cabins at all.\n\nThanks in advance.",
