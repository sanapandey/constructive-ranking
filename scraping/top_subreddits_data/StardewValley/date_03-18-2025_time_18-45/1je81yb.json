    "selftext": "Since I first started playing in 2018, I play as a girl most of the time and marry another girl. There have been a few times when I play as a boy and marry another boy. But I\u2019m on a new save playing as a girl and I married a guy for the first time. I picked Shane because I hadn't married him yet. I thought he\u2019d be helpful around the farm since he\u2019s lived on one for a while and it distracts him from his depression.\n\nWRONG. He lies about doing chores, STILL drinks and spends all night at the saloon and won\u2019t clean up his muddy footprints. I don't care if he's depressed, he's not tracking that damn mess in the house!\n\nThe last straw was when he said to me: \u201cYou could\u2019ve cleaned up a little while I was gone\u2026It's not very nice to have to wade through a bunch of junk after a hard day's work.\u201d That's rich coming from the guy whose dirty footprints have permanently stained our home. Alos, whatever hard work he\u2019s talking about, I sure haven\u2019t seen it. He hasn\u2019t gotten a job since Joja shut down and I spend hours toiling on the farm to support his freeloading. Never once seen him trying to help out.\n\nAnyway, I officially divorced him last night. but I\u2019ve been wooing Sebastian, including while I was still married to Shane. I gave him a bouquet and saw his 10-heart cutscene and everything.",

I know another cutscene was added that he's still really cut back on drinking and stuff but that was added after I stopped playing that farm.\n\nEven then he still just sits around on your farm and does very little, compared to how he starts working on Marnie's farm post community center restoration. \n\nI honestly feel like he's a healthier individual if you befriend him to his highest degree but don't enter a romantic relationship with him.
