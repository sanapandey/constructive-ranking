This is my first time seeing this dialogue from Sam and it honestly broke my heart. Poor Sam is so sweet and loving when it comes to his family so I can only imagine how this thought is bothering him.",

He is incredibly empathetic and emotionally aware of his complex family situation. He goes out of his way to be a role model to his little brother and doesn't want his mom to feel any unnecessary stress, and wants her to feel like she can depend on him to be responsible.",

He also enjoys the same things I do irl, like music, taking walks in the forest in the fall and living in a small town.",

                            "body": "I've said it before, but Sam is very emotionally mature and perceptive! Given the fact he's supposed to be \"the man of the house\" in Kent's absence, plus how he acts in his 3-heart event, I don't agree with the common sentiment that he's a \"manchild\" for acting so positive and upbeat despite his circumstances. Especially since it's for Vincent and Jodi's sake. He's trying to ensure their lives aren't tougher and more grim than they already are, and he does what he can. Jodi mentions money being tight. She's a stay-at-home mom. Sam has a part-time job (working at Joja, and if Joja's gone, he works at the museum/library) to help pay the bills.\n\nI also don't see the \"correct\" choice in the 4-heart scene (the infamous egg snack scene) as an indication that he's childish either. Jodi takes on the burden of raising two kids by herself, and her dialogue outright indicates that she's overwhelmed and doesn't want Sam and Vincent to have to deal with that same stress. Of course, this is to their detriment (Sam can't cook), but it's a result of having kids so young and missing out on her own youth that she embraces the opposite for them. Hence, her reaction to him dropping an egg is overblown because it's effectively the straw that broke the camel's back. The player claiming responsibility for the egg is them doing their part to ease her stress, or at least ensuring she doesn't blame her adult child (who has already given her enough grief in the past, if you recall his record for community service hours and penchant for pulling pranks) as someone causing more trouble for her.",

I took it as the stress from being a military wife and raising the kids mostly by herself.\n\n\nSometimes life turns out painfully and you wish you didn't have to deal with those struggles. For example my grandma lost my grandpa to cancer in his thirties and had to raise her kids while working full time. But she says she never regretted marrying him young. Only regrets that she didn't have longer with him, because of how deeply in love they were.\n\n\nMaybe I'm projecting, idk. I just feel it's a bit deeper than \"don't marry young or you'll always carry a secret pain of wondering what could have been.\" She can be deeply unhappy with having an absent spouse and then watching him struggle with PTSD without necessarily wishing they hadn't married.",
