If they do, you'd probably look for something like 'text triggers' or 'chat commands' and just add the command there, as well as the response you want it to say in chat.\n\nAh, yeah. Just looked, they added one.\n\nHave them log into the SE website, then on the left click 'Chatbot', then 'Chat commands'. At the top click 'Custom commands', then the big blue 'Add new command' button.\n\nPut the trigger phrase into the \"!Command name\" box, and the response in the \"Response type\" box at the bottom.\n\nNo idea if there's a way to provide access for a mod to do this, but it's super simple for the streamer to do it.",
