    "selftext": "I just switched over to OBS Studio from Streamlabs OBS to lessen the load on my CPU. It was going just fine for a while but recently, it's been having it's own issue. During most streams and in the middle of them while I'm live, OBS Studio shoots me an error that says it doesn't have the correct stream key. I then have to close and restart OBS and it works again, sometimes the issue repeating itself during the same session. I check the stream key to Twitch and it's completely correct still.\n\n  \nIs there any way to figure out why it's doing this and to fix it?",
