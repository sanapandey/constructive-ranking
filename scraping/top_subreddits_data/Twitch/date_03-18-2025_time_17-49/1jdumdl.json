I've been thinking about streaming for awhile now, and I finally have everything set up for it.\n\nThe only thing to do now is to... actually do it \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI was thinking of going live for the first time tonight playing a co-op game with my boyfriend. I'm nervous and very on the fence if I should make the jump.\n\nWhat should I be expecting as a first time streamer? And how do I keep from the nerves getting to me?",

MY PC hated Elden Ring and my set up \\*I run stream avatars/vtube studio/Flood/TiTs/MixItUp/other programs/have browser tabs open in the background for stream manager\\* all with 16gb of ram and a 1070 gtx with like an 8700k I7.\n\n  \nBasically my game was \"playable\" but it wasn't wonderful to play but I was having an absolute blast, my friends though invited me to play Fortnite and stream it with them so I went to my BRB screen like anyone would and I started closing down Elden Ring and Loading up Fortnite.\n\n  \nMy SETGAME was still Elden Ring and the streamer raided me with 52 people roughly and I couldn't even use my PC. All I could do was sit on BRB screen, wait for Fortnite to try and struggle to load, didn't know the SETGAME command back then and it was just an absolute mess. The streamer was extremely nice to me though still when I'd be in chat and I apologized for it discreetly at the same time without self promo.\n\n  \nSometimes, chaos and shit happens but I'm still streaming and I fuuuucking love every second of it. Scuf is what makes streaming fun although it can be stressful when you can't figure out how to deal with the scuf mid stream haha.\n\n  \nMy advice, just do it...dive in and just hit Go Live. I don't have any anxiety to the point where I'll just hit \"go live\" before half my stuff is even open and things have literally broken from this where I've had to refresh sources or reconnect things...I just get over zealous and excited sometimes and full send.  The point is here though...this can't hurt you and it can even lead to some clippable moments really.\n\n  \nI had a Fortnite stream where I felt like I was landing with 2 FPS, I literally went to land and my screen looked like an old Atari game with the pause/go movement. My friends made a clip of it and it still goes strong to this day haha.\n\n  \nFind the fun of it and it will open be a nice thing if it's meant to be. u/michisquishy",

That should take a lot of the 'pressure' off.\n\nJust play games you enjoy and narrate/explain what you're doing and why.\n\nSide note: Add Sery\\_Bot as a moderator to your channel (go to their profile, they have easy to follow instructions) to prevent spam bots coming into your chat. A lot of new streamers are getting duped by the generic script bots have these days (They send a few timed messages like \"how are you\", \"how's your stream going?\" etc) and ending up really disheartened that someone they thought was a genuine viewer was just trying to scam them by selling AI generated artwork.",

Here's a small tip for when you feel like you are overwhelmed before or during a stream: If at any point you feel the need to stop streaming, just hit that stop button. If you got some viewers, just make something up and bring your viewers to raid another streamer before you stop. That way, you can gather yourself and come back to it again. Your followers will understand.(some wont but dont pay them too much mind)\n\nThe beauty of Streaming is that you are in control of when and what you stream. You decide when to go live and when to leave. Over time the anxiety of streaming and going live will go away. I've met quite a few great streamers that also helped me get over that fear. Honestly, If it makes you feel less scared to go live if you play games with your boyfriend, then there you go! The amount of times my fiance and I play pokemon TCG live together, had helped me get over the anxiety.\n\nBest of luck to you, Happy Streaming, and most importantly, HAVE FUN =)",

When i had my first few streams i super advertised to all my friends and family and coworkers etc etc etc and got maybe around 30 followers before i ever went live (which is cool and all) but then i realized you cant disable the going live notification that gets sent out to all of your followers every time you go live (unless they turn it off themselves) so this put even more nerves in me that basically everybody i know in real life will be trying to tune in and i wish i wouldnt have went that route. My recommendation is that if youre nervous, make a burner and maybe tell one or two people so they can hop in and check the quality for you but this way growth is not only organic, but youre not feeling pressured by people you actually know trying to tune in and making it kinda awkward when you have 2 viewers",

            "body": "take that jump!! \n\nI was also nervous about starting to stream after someone recommended it to me, no one really turned up for my first one but in my second stream I had a wonderful woman come in and invite me to her discord of other small streamers we now have a great little group that all supports each other. \n\nI am currently taking a break from streaming and working on yt vids ATM. However I managed to get to affiliate in a few months with a few regular viewers and I will be going back to it as soon as I have my area sorted. It can be really fun and enjoyable and I've met some really cool people along the way.\n\nPlay with your bf for the first time, don't pay too much attention to chat or viewer count and play as if you are not being watched. Be yourself and don't force anything that doesn't come naturally. And I'm sure you'll have people jumping in and enjoying it in no time. However don't get disheartened if the viewer count is small to begin with. It will grow over time and with dedication \n\nGood luck with your streaming adventure and I wish you all the very best \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

Find people who fit your vibe and make em mods once they've shown they respect you, it will make your life much easier, other than that just play the games you want to and be yourself. Good luck out there!",

You might meet someone that likes the game you're playing and genuinely engages with you. You might not meet anyone at all. Either way, you can determine then if this is something that makes sense to you and fits your lifestyle. I've become very thankful for the people I've met over the years and the comfort that streaming has brought me. I couldn't even navigate OBS when I started streaming again for the second time, but I've been blessed by good people that were willing to help me along the way. Play and stream what you love and when you feel well enough to do so! Best wishes in your streaming journey.",

The first step is the hardest to take.  You have a supportive partner. Lean into that.  If they're available and willing, see if they'll sit in your chat and converse with you. Talk about the game. If someone pops in to your chat and says hello, respond. Don't be surprised if some folks from around these parts show up to support ya.  You got this!",
