Got exposed to toxic communities, drama etc etc.\n\nJust went live the other day just to yap and really enjoyed that same feeling I missed.\n\nI think learning to enjoy the process and not worrying about numbers/chatters has really started to sink into my head now! Something I always knew, but didn\u2019t truly resonate with until recently.\n\nPace yourself, try to not get caught up in everything and enjoy the process! Y\u2019all got this :)",
