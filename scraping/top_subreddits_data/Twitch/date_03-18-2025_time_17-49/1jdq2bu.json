            "body": "Depends on definition of success and what size channels you are talking about.\n\nBig creators could probably take a 10+ year hiatus and come back with TRIPLE their previous numbers because people always clamor back to the big names upon their return. How long they'll stick around will depend on the content and how things have changed. \n\nFor smaller creators, it's MUCH more rare that it happens. It's already hard to get dedicated viewers period, and you can imagine if your gone for 1-2 years or longer, they'll have found other streamers to watch. You'll essentially be starting from scratch. \n\nSome people watch more than one person, but a lot only watch one. Maybe two. And after that long, they 100% found their comfort streamers by then. So you'd be growing from a brand new audience besides MAYBE a few that do come back that still remember you and maybe forgot to unfollow or just don't pay enough attention to their follow list. \n\nCan it happen? Of course. Depends on like 100 factors. But for smaller channels where they just aren't really known at all, it's infinitely more rare. We don't have the social media pull or anyone who knows us to spread the word across everyone and all socials. Big streamers only have to announce it once and everyone will spread it around for them with no effort required on their side and end up breaking all their previous records. (Obviously again, still situational. If it's because that streamer was caught with CP or doing something sketchy on that side, then obviously not the same scenario lol) \n\nBut if we're talking about just general statistics and averages, this is usually how it works out. Just depends what kinda creator they were before, and just how big they were. Someone with like 1-5k probably not as much, but someone with 20k+ is almost always going to come back to 2-3x more viewers at least the first few days.",

Same with discord if you have a server!  \nAs for Twitch, it's hard to know if they're active or not until you start streaming again.\n\nI think the best way to go about it is to expect to get 0 viewers. That way you won't set yourself up to be disappointed if you have to start over from 0, and you'll be pleasantly surprised if people end up joining from the get-go!\n\nEither way, go kick some ass!

Started in 2018, got affiliate in my first week, did really well and started believing I could eventually go fulltime if I kept growing and earning at the pace I was. In 2020 my health got a bit worse so I stopped streaming as often, and then in 2022 I had to quit cold-turkey when I developd a chronic illness and was bedbound for a year. I've been away ever since.\n\nNow, in January, I decided I want to come back. But due to my illness I don't have as much energy as before and don't want to be on camera, so I've decided to go from webcam streaming to vtube streaming, and since the content is very different I've decided to start over under a new username and everything. I still keep up with what's left of my old community in my discord server and instagram, but not a lot of them are active anymore- and even less of them are interested in vtubers, so I'm pretty much starting from scratch. I got maybe 15-20ish followers from my old 3800. \n\nBut I don't think it's a bad thing! I'm excited to see if I can get the same results once again, despite switching my content up this much! Starting over can be fun and exciting, it all depends on your mindset!",
