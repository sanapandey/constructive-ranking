    "selftext": "Hi\u00a0r/Twitch !\n\nI have a Twitch & YT channel that is NOT geared towards dads at the moment (not posting it right now, as I do not want to advertise).\n\nEver since becoming a dad, I had to put it on the backburner, and family took first place, of course. :)\n\nBut, the passion never died and I am finding ways to\u00a0**keep gaming, as a dad**, and I would like to share my experiences with that.\n\n  \nWould you be interested in a channel that would cover topics like these:\n\n* what games are good for dads with limited time and why (for example, ones where you can complete matches in 15mins)\n* what consoles are good for dads (for example, ones with suspend game state options)\n* what hardware is good for dads (for example, quiet mice and keyboards, so the kid can sleep)\n* nostalgic content from our gaming childhoods\n* suggestions on other equipment, such as good chairs that help with back pain when you are older :D\n* other topics, basically everything dads could relate to, since I am living through it\n\n  \nI would probably stream twice a week on Twitch, and try to create content as much as I can on YT.\n\nDoes this sound interesting to you all? :)\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!",

While you did mention that your channel would be primarily focused on gaming as a dad I figured it would map well onto someone who's busy, which I may be soon. It's a fairly open niche as far as I know.",
