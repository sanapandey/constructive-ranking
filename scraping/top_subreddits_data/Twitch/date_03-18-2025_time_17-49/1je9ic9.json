    "selftext": "I have a weird issue and am wondering if anyone else has experienced this. We have a Samsung smart TV with the Twitch app. One specific streamer has the audio cut in and out to the point where it's unwatchable/not understandable. Their audio is completely fine on tablets, phones, and computers. This doesn't happen with any other streamer I have watched. It has done this for years. No audio problems anywhere else on the TV. What the heck is going on?",

If you have speakers on your TV that don't work on any side - if the broadcaster is speaking into that particular side of the microphone - you won't be able to hear it!",
