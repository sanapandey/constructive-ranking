    "selftext": "Been watching this league streamer for years now, and I can just tell they've completely burnt out on league.\n\nUnfortunately for them they based their whole career on being a league streamer, and if they stop playing league their views plummet.\n\nFor me I realised they had come to hate league when they openly stated they were just \"punching in for the day\", when they opened league at the start of a stream.\n\nGranted they were in the low thousands so if they were smart they saved their money, but nowadays their view count sits in the hundreds.\n\nBut it does show the dangers of being a one game streamer, since if you come to hate the game you can't ever escape lest you kill your viewership.\n\nSome streamers can escape this trap, but many streamers are tied to one game forever if they wanna pay the bills, and transitioning to variety is EXTREMELY difficult if you didn't start out as a variety streamer.\n\nSo what was your experience with this?",

That was when I mostly stopped. The PvP games obviously stressed him out and brought out a bad side of him. \n\nI remember the one stream where he said he was going to quit playing the game and his mods encouraged him to please do something else, only for him to get snippy and queue back up for another match. I think that\u2019s when his viewer count really started to fall. It wasn\u2019t entertaining to watch him rage. People wanted to watch him for fun.",

She was really good at the game and managed to build a small dedicated following REALLY fast, so she didn't mind sticking to one game. DBD has had a pretty bad history of awful balancing and META changes, and while she tried to stick with it, she very clearly started to get burnt out. DBD also has an AWFUL community. It's genuinely one of the worst in gaming, I'm surprised people don't mention it more. These factors, along with some personal community problems, got so bad that she just stopped playing mid stream and didn't open the game for a year, for stream or for fun, and ended up giving up on streaming all together a few months after.",

I will say that I did stop watching the content. I would rather watch them play a new game they liked than sit and watch them be negative every stream but continue to play.\n\nI do feel bad because as you point out these streamers do kind of get themselves trapped. If you make a lot of money off a game you know don\u2019t want to play, it can be hard to justify switching up. When I stream while I do a good chunk of my streaming for one game I do play others and I have even taken breaks from the game altogether when new releases I like come out.

One side of the coin is that its easier to grow and get started on a single game, but the other side is you run the risk of hating the game because you forced yourself to play it and ingrained your identity in that games community.\n\nOne of my friends built their audience on Dead by Daylight, and really just grew to not enjoy the game. They moved to Val, which was kinda short lived but it she lost a lot of viewers because it was a *drastic* turn from her old content and now she just grinds rivals and dabbles in DBD(and still dislikes it) but that's really it. She'll have like 3 matches of DBD and then go play rivals for 4 hours - then vents to me, in private, that her viewership is lower when she swaps to rivals...\n\nShe built her audience on a game where she didn't take it serious and was able to chat a lot and respond directly to things said in chat to a competitive shooter that doesn't allow her to consistently engage with chat outside of the matchmaking queue. It doesn't help that he pretty much exclusively plays ranked too. Quick Play would be more care free but she does t enjoy it.\n\nAnd not only did I see her grow to hate DBD, but I'm watching her drive for streaming dwindle because she isnt getting the viewership she used to.\n\nIt's unfortunate but it's what happens when you develop an audience looking for one type of game.",
