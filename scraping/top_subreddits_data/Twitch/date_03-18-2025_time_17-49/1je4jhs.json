I'm not saying just spew garbage the entire time, but it's better than me watching you saying nothing with a blank expression. Aldo, find your niche. Sometimes, it might be alluring to be playing the newest biggest baddest game on the market. Due to the amount of over saturation, it might be best to atsrt with smaller games until you pick up some steam to branch out. My own personal thoughts, so don't sweat the small stuff. Best of luck out there, my friends! Stay positive and take breaks",

On paper, it was a huge success - growth was up, revenue was great, and viewership looked strong.\n\nBut it came at a cost:\n\n* Lurking killed engagement - Viewers got used to keeping my stream open without interacting. Even when I was live, chat was quiet despite high viewership.\n* Viewers checked out - Some checked in, saw I was sleeping or away, and eventually stopped coming back.\n* It became a grind - Streaming that much started feeling like an obligation, not a passion. And when your joy fades, so does your audience's.\n\nLesson learned: What looks like success at first can hurt long-term momentum. Numbers don't build communities - engagement does.",

There might be exceptions, but the likelihood is ***overwhelmingly*** against on a level that's tough to fully convey.  \nLike reaching blindfolded into a 50lb bag of rice and picking out one specified grain on your first try. While it's inside a running concrete mixer.\n\n---\n\nPersonal mistakes? Bit of a toss-up.\n\nFocusing too much on trying to get perfect image quality and the technical aspects, instead of working on being more engaging and entertaining.  \nNobody gives the faintest shadow of a fuck if you are putting out crystal-clear 1080p60 video, if you're less interesting than watching grass grow. Just playing the game is not enough. You *need* to be an active entertainer, on-stage and mentally **present** for the entire stream.\n\nSecond, letting other things get in the way of stream consistency. I had to disappear for almost a year due to my day job at the time demanding ridiculous hours. I should have pushed back against that for *so* many reasons. But it is hands-down the #1 reason that I dropped from 600accv to 300accv to 100accv. People moved on. Can't blame them. Entirely my screwup.",

Turned out that they just could see how fast our communities were growing and essentially wanted to absorb our communities into theirs. Made us stop promoting our own discord servers and we had to push a 'joint' discord server that the big streamer owned. Then said big streamer started spreading horrible rumours about the streamers on their team to turn viewers against them. I was hitting 400-500 average viewers at the time and when they started spreading rumours, I quickly went down to 100-150 after that. I was a full-time streamer for a couple of years, but had to quit in the end. They used their influence to make it so I couldn't financially afford to carry on. \n\nSafe to say they eventually showed their true colours to their own viewers and damaged their own reputation in the end. \n\nWhen a big streamer notices you, it seems surreal and you feel lucky, but they're not all good people trying to help you move up the ladder.",

I think it's not that people lack the talent or gear on twitch  it's that twitch has a pretty low discovery and the smaller channels can be amazing but get over looked which is sad because i've watched , subbed , donated and followed many small streamers and to this day are amazing and some I consider good talented people. \n\nAs many note and have posted, this is why it is vital Now ah days to promote your content to other social media sites to help usher people to seeing your amazing content.

I don't think I'd still be streaming if I got Partner back then though, cause the way I was thinking about status and streaming is so much different than now, and I'm so much happier now with what I have!\n\nConsistency is key, and your goal should be community, not the game you play.

I also based my community on positivity, supporting each other and avoiding harsh discussions like religion and politics. People have their views, but a lot of us are looking for an escape from that, but still very aware of the real world. Everyone runs their channel differently, and if you want the heated discussions, that's your choice. Consistency is key, people don't really like much change. That being said, i've switched to variety with a hard focus on Phasmo, the retro folks stuck around cause eventually people stay for the streamer, not the game.\n\nPeople don't join my discord as much anymore but a way to get people interested is to remind them it exists. Having your bot pop up a message saying \"join our community discord at \\*link\" and when you see that message in your chat you can mention it Live.\n\nI hope this helps ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)",

I made friends there and when I came back to streaming, those speedrun friends made my streams fun and \u201csuccessful\u201d for about a year until I started dipping back into the simulator games. Old friends got involved and the sense of humor and vibes weren\u2019t what the speedrun friends were after and it basically killed my streams.",
