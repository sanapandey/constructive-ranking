    "selftext": "So I bought a stream overlay bundle off Etsy and so far I\u2019ve been able to figure out how to upload most of the cosmetics but I\u2019m struggling with the chat box. The chat box they sent me is a PNG file and I know that streamlabs asks for a CSS body/code? So I don\u2019t know if that means the chat box that I paid for  is completely useless or if I\u2019m just doing this all wrong\u2026\n\nI\u2019d greatly appreciate any help and insight. Thanks!",
