Now every time I stream I just have bots hit my chat trying to sell something and it feels really discouraging as a new streamer. I do want to actually connect with people and have fun with my chat. Does it just take consistent usage or do y'all recommend joining Discords, be active in other streamer's chats, etc.?  Thanks!",

It's great to build friendships with other streamers and you can create along side each other boosting each others' motivation to create better content.\n\nDon't just go to streams with the intent of growing yours, but to make friends and grow your own social scope.\n\nAlso, create content for other platforms. YouTube, TikTok and Insta are all great places to share video content. If you make content that is on one of these platforms, especially YouTube. You can have a constant stream of new viewers redirected from them to your Twitch. Making high quality content is an effort, but it will help drive viewers to your stream to check you out beyond what a YouTube video can offer",

Being active on other platforms is definitely a must because it honestly does feel impossible to generate organic growth on twitch itself. Even more so that they removed the host feature. TikTok is kind of big one for getting your content out there is short digestible fragments.  I also highly recommend going into other peoples streams, i usually prefer channels around my own size, and making genuine contacts and connections.  As for discord, i think it\u2019s useful but you kinda have to look for the right communities. If you\u2019re trying to grow you may not want to join a discord that is solely dedicated to one person\u2019s content, and maybe look for servers that are more bent on building a community type vibe.  The work you put into streaming and networking and getting your content on other platforms for people to see is going dictate your growth and success in my personal opinion.",

I've definitely noticed that many gaming communities of a specific game have sub-communities in certain languages, and those are often niche but more dedicated, because they are rare and have less competition. Some viewers may only watch a specific game on twitch, and some may only watch a specific game ONLY in a specific language, so they will often be dedicated to one of the handful of streamers streaming that game in that specific language. So those streamers are often almost guaranteed to get views because barely anyone will stream said game in that language and people who are interested will almost have no choice but to join the stream lol.",

I immediately was shutdown from thinking that was a good idea, I got called a Ponzi scheme and was told it was \u201cfake engagement\u201d \ud83e\udd23 So I mean I guess the gatekeepers don\u2019t want new streamers to post their links and make other streamer friends\u2026.

So people definitely DO find small streamers if you\u2019re not streaming a way too popular game for your status on twitch.\n\nAgreed no one is watching a 1 viewer dude play competitive games or something like Elden Ring.
