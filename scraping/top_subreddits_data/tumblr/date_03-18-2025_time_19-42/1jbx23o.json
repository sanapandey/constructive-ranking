A little shrimp? -> Man continues on his manly quest, refusing to help her find and catch small things -> Man inevitably gets injured/starved -> She now has to feed them both, maybe he'll leave her there.\n\nIt doesn't always happen and some men are awesome, some women suck.

Like, I can clearly define a Hadron as a group of quarks in a bound state, and I can further split that into Baryons (odd number of quarks) and Mesons (even number of quarks) and give some properties they all have (Baryons all have half-integer spin and Mesons integer-spin, as an example) but there's going to be a lot of different things in each category.\n\nAnd the more complex you get the trickier it gets. Take atoms- first off, how do you define an \"atom\" as distinct from \"not an atom\"? Your first instinct might be to say that any atom consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons... except that can't be right, because the most common atom in the universe is Hydrogen-1, which doesn't have any neutrons. Okay, so what if we say an atom contains protons and electrons and maybe neutrons? But what if it's fully ionized, as in plasma, where the electrons no longer associate with individual nuclei? Is a bare nucleus still an atom? Is an alpha particle an atom? Is a bare single proton just an H+ ion and technically still an atom? And then if we're trying to define types of atoms, we can certainly define them by the number of protons they have and get groups that have mostly consistent chemical properties even if they don't all have the same number of neutrons, but that also means you've got hundreds of different categories for things, and if you're trying to group them into smaller categories, they'll get less clean.\n\nAnd if you're getting any bigger than single atoms, the complexity gets almost infinitely higher because there's just so many different ways you can combine atoms to get bigger things.",

Gendered divisions of labour exist in all societies (with only one example so far of a genderless society that can no longer be studied because they quickly adopted gendered customs after coming into contact with them).",

Men might on average be stronger than women, but humanity is incredibly diverse within sexes, even more so within genders. The fact is that it\u2019s impossible to assume a man is stronger than a woman simply due to that. And there are different kinds of strength, and I mean physically. The strength that lets you run far is not the same as what lets you lift heavy shit. There\u2019s a significant amount of difference between individuals. You wouldn\u2019t call a guy to lift something that a woman is already lifting perfectly well. And let\u2019s face it, a lot of labor that is \u201ctraditionally\u201d done by women is just as intense and hard as that done by men, or do you think carrying milk, washing laundry by hand, cleaning and fixing the home, etc are easy? Hell, do you think women wouldn\u2019t also be tending the fields? Because that would be factually incorrect",

I don't know enough about injected insulin to know whether estrogen would have an impact on it, so type 1 where insulin stops being produced probably wouldn't be strongly affected by estrogen, but I wonder how estrogen affects the onset and treatment of type 2 diabetes?\n\nI did a brief search and [this article's abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36897358/) has some interesting statistics on diagnosis rates and conditions for type 2 diabetes between women and men and since, on a generalized level, women have more estrogen than men, it seems like there could be some correlation between estrogen and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Or maybe it's underdiagnosed in women, or maybe they are type 2 prediabetic and less likely to know because of how estrogen impacts insulin regulation.\n\nMakes me wonder if estrogen could be a part of effective early treatment of type 2 diabetes. Probably wouldn't happen, because the research would be really weird to organize and most of the countries with the resources to do this type of research are still weird about hormones and sex/gender, but it's an interesting thought. Maybe they can try it in mice some time.",

This is an important contribution and addition, but ***it does not automatically destroy the \u201cmyth\u201d of Man the Hunter as presented***. In other words, this new evidence does not refute years of accumulated evidence supporting gendered divisions of labor as a human evolutionary strategy. The claim is incomplete unless the authors develop the implications of such evidence to the level where it matters in evolutionary terms. \n\nMaybe you should read it again.",

They might\u2019ve benefited white women, but it was lesbian and black women creating movements that would take on their own causes and adopt broader views on oppression that allowed feminism to become more of a liberation movement for all women, and eventually (as it is now) for people of all genders and gender identities, of different races and backgrounds, different sexualities, etc.",
