The intro is long, but you're basically doing boss battles the entire story at decent pace so you're always getting something to craft or a new weapon. \n\nThe interface is extremely clunky and it's insane how many menus is in the game but overall this would be the one to try if you were ever interested in trying again.",

One complaint that older players have about the new campaign is that it's quite handholdy and \"on rails\", but probably wouldnt annoy you nearly as much as a new player.\n\nI dont think searching a monster for a long time is really a thing in any of the games, I think you might have seen people complaining about hunting monsters repeatedly and not getting a desired rare material for a long time, but that too is less of a thing in the modern titles",
