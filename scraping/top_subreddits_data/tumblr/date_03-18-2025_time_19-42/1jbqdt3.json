My mom didn't care but was sort of looking forward to being \"Grandma\".\n\nSister's kids decided to call her Mops. Now ALL my niblings call them Mops and Pops. My mom still makes fun of my dad for forcing her to have *that* as her name with 5 humans because he decided to have a crisis about getting older lmao",
