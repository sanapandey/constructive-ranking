The fact that internet speeds are much much faster than in the past also made it less necessary to buffer a whole video.\n\nI suppose the best alternative in a pinch is just downloading the video as an mp4 file using software like jdownloader",

If a billion dollar corpo can't figured out how to make money without being painful to use then it sounds like they need to figure themselves out imo\n\nIt's the standard across the board for tech. Almost every website and app has operated at a massive loss, going all-in on growth and investors. Many *to this day* struggle to make a profit (reddit, for example) and most only manage it very recently by becoming significantly worse for the users (such as Uber, Amazon, etc).\n\nNow I'm not saying I have sympathy for these companies, half of them outright shouldn't exist and had unsustainable business models, while the other half rely on simply not complying with the regulation the rest of the industry has to (such as airBNB ignoring all short-term rental and hotel regulations everyone else must follow by saying \"we're just an app, teehee\"). \n\nBut turns out there's almost no money in most good sites and apps. They either get way worse to use to start breaking even, are still in their growth phase and operating at a loss, or die off. It's a big part of why we have a fraction of the sites we did 15+ years ago.",
