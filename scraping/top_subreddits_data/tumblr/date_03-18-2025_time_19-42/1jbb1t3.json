It's imaginary. You can make up whatever rules you want. The actual question is why do you want to fuck a thing that looks like an animal in the first place?",

I love the implication in his design that he was made as just a bigger version of the actual toy, with the head split down the middle to make it easier to attach to the body, and then the halves of the *grew* flesh and teeth).\n\nBut the biggest blemish on that imo is the smiling critters (and to a lesser extent doey's face and his stupid neck). Their giant, toothless, dark, gaping mouths feel like they're trying WAYYY too hard to make an otherwise innocuous design look disquieting.",

His basic design is pretty cute imo - big and fluffy with a really big smile - but the teeth got added as a horror element. It's the later chapters where the game really shines, especially with characters like Mommy Long-Legs and the Smiling Critters (CatNap is appropriately horrifying, and DogDay's nonthreatening appearance matches his sweetheart personality). Even in chapter one though, I think it's the little details that sell it, like the cutouts that start screaming if you click their speaker too much or warn you to leave. Huggy isn't necessarily very scary, it's mainly a chase sequence in the first chapter, but he's a good introduction to the world. \n\nCharacters like Yarnaby, Mommy Long-Legs, and CatNap are the designs that sold me. And Poppy, the actual intended mascot (and potential real antagonist), is great. And the lore! I loooove the lore.",
