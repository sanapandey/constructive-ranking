                    "body": "Kanji are (generally) made up of small constituent parts (called radicals) that have more or less definitive meanings, to the point that someone who is basically fluent in your typical kanji could figure out (or at least ballpark guess) what an unknown kanji means, even without knowing its pronunciation or any particular context. With how much word processors, text-interpretative software, etc. has advanced, I'd imagine it'd not be that hard to have a method to digitize unknown or rare kanji through the use of these radicals (perhaps made even easier by the ubiquity of touchscreen and pen-input devices these days. I mean, hell, when you sketch an unknown kanji into Google Translate, it's basically half doing a reverse image search, and half trying to suss out what radicals your chicken scratch actually meant).\n\nNow, how cross compatible those characters would be across systems or software is a whole different beast, but just getting the kanji *into* a system feels like it'd be fairly easy.",

Also, in these particular examples, the Z and the radical with the extended arm in the last one are not standard radicals, and therefore couldn't be represented that way even if that system did exist.",

In my limited experience you type the kana and select the proper kanji from auto-fill, since multiple kanji have the same spelling. Those kana aren't apparent in the kanji, themselves, but they are pronounced with Japanese phonemes that you CAN input. That last kanji is \"hanashi,\" comprised of the phonemes/kana/\"letters\" \"ha,\" \"na,\" and \"shi.\" So you'd type hanashi and correct it to the kanji.",
