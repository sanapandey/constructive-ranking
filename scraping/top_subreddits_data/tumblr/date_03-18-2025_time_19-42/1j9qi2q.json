For many people he would have gone from \"oh yeah, I kinda remember him from high school history\" to a huge name in pop culture virtually overnight.\n\nSo this kid went from \"named for slightly obscure historical figure\" to \"shares a name with the biggest pop culture sensation\" right at the age where kids will latch onto pop culture and be plugged into it enough to make fun of each other.",
