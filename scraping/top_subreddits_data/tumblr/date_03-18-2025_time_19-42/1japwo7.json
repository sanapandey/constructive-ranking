On the page for \"Averted Trope\" it mentions this exact phenomenon and why you should only note an aversion if the aversion itself worth talking about.\n\nThis is bolded on the Averted Trope page\n\n>Aversions should almost never be listed on trope pages, as they're almost always completely meaningless. Generally, only nigh Omnipresent Tropes, Acceptable Breaks from Reality or No Straight Examples, Please! tropes should have aversions listed as examples. If a work simply doesn't use a trope, it is by definition not an example of the trope\n\nI like \"Defied Trope\" a lot more, where the work itself draws attention to the aversion",

And if you can't give some example of it happening, and all you've got is \"trust me bro, I've seen it, it happens\"...well, that's not a compelling case, and no one is obligated to believe you. \n\nSo you end up with an issue that is so uncommon, no one can cite an example of it, which makes OOP come across as a whiner; someone who would rather make a Tumblr post complaining about a non-issue, instead of taking a minute to fix the thing they're complaining about (because newsflash, it costs nothing to make a TVTropes account, and anyone can edit a page. So nothing would be stopping OOP from just...editing out the content which would take all of twenty seconds, instead of crying about it on Tumblr and acting like it's some big deal)",

But Averted Chosen One makes no sense for something like the Three Stooges or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days \n\nSimilarly, tropes that span many or all genres can\u2019t really be averted so much as just not used.
