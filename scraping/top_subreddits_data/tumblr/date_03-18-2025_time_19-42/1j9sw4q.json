Don't resign yourself to feeling like you're gonna be in pain forever and there's nothing you can do about it. Strength training can also help decrease your risk of injury. A strong predictor for how old you can grow before needing a caretaker is physical strength, especially in the legs. Weight training is great for this. As long as you use good form (youtube is great for learning form) and don't overload yourself with too much weight, the risk of injury is low. The stronger you get, the less likely you'll be injured doing everyday tasks like bending over. It also increases bone density, making you less likely to break a hip when you're old.",

Now my joints always slightly hurt before this, but nothing extreme. \n\nThen one day, I was going up, and first step felt normal. Second hurt a bit in my right knee. Third step, moderate pain. Fourth step wow this is really hurting, fifth step SHARP pain, sixth step \"this is truly unbearable\", and by the time i got to the top it felt like any additional step and my leg would snap in half, no exaggeration it was EXTREMELY sharp pain.\n\nWent to the doctor who prescribed sodium diclofenac, but it hasnt really helped. I got out of that job and my knees are \"mostly fine\" but now if i, for example, do leg curls at the gym - the next day, every single step even with no pressure gives me that sharp \"say goodbye to your legs\" pain.\n\nHave you found any success in coping with it?",

Not really, the main cause of mine is a Vit D issue (Retention rather than creation - think leaky fuel tank), aggravated by having fused bones in both my ankles, being formerly hypermobile in several of my joints, in addition to having two semi-frozen shoulders - I struggle to get either of them up to 90 degrees (my right is about 80 and my left 85, at the moment) without 'popping' them out the sockets to get higher.\n\nCurrently taking a combination of Vit D supplements (1 mg+ per day), Glucosamine (2400mg), Chondroitin (600mg), Boswellia (300mg) and Turmeric (2800mg) along side the occasional handful of painkillers when it gets too bad - though that's just more for numbing it, than dealing with the cause. \n\nFor you is it more in the muscle surrounding the joint, or in the joint itself?  If it's in the joint itself, rather than in the muscle itself, then taking glucosamine and chondroitin alongside it may help - though if you're mixing with prescription meds its always better to play it safe and run it by your doc.\n\nMost of the time I'll just take my meds in the morning, and put up with it as it gets worse over the day.  \n\nGetting out of that particular job was probably the best thing you could do for your body at that time - I'm currently in a similar boat, after having my back go twice at one of my last jobs; and am trying to avoid getting back into that field.\n\nOther than that, I'm just stubbornness-ing my way through it, which is probably not the best option in the long term.",

This helps lubricate your joints as I understand it. If you do too much on your knees, you'll damage them, and if you don't do enough exercise you'll also damage them. Walking is great. Walking on surfaces other than concrete is even better. The biggest issue is that you shouldn't bang your knees into things or do pivots that involve turning your knee, as that's when you're most likely to damage it. For example, several years ago, I dislocated my kneecap twisting to get out of a car after a very minor fender bender In which I had not been injured",
