They're really promising for aging studies, but it's hard to get any meaningful research done because of the difficulty in establishing and maintaining colonies. Also, there's so little research being done on them that it can be hard to get good peer review criticism. Everyone is so used to working with mice that nobody really knows how to deal with naked mole rat papers. It's kinda funny.",

The problem is that it can randomly be switched on by mutations.\n\nThe way that cancer develops is through two main types of carcinogenic (cancer-causing) mutations: oncogene activation and tumor suppressor deactivation.\n\nProto-oncogenes are genes that, when mutated in a certain way, become oncogenes. Oncogenes actively drive the cell towards uncontrolled growth, usually by permanently turning on a signal pathway that tells the cell to divide.\n\nTumor suppressors are genes that actively prevent cancer from developing. These genes are usually the ones that act as barriers to cell growth and division or promote apoptosis (controlled cell death). Mutations can deactivate them, effectively taking off the guardrails that protect against cancer.\n\nIn research mice, you can usually just activate one or two of their oncogenes in order for them to develop cancer. Naked mole rats are much more cancer-resistant and you need about three oncogenes turned on plus one or two tumor suppressors deactivated. Humans are somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.",
