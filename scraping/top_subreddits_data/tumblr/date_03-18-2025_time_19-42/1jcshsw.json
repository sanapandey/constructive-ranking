Those episodes genuinely are horrifying in ways that's difficult to put into words because, as you said, it does feel like your consciousness is trapped in a body that's not your own, a spectator doomed to inaction.\n\nAnyway, soon after, he prescribed me Ritalin and suddenly, I could just do things I was thinking of, and it honestly made me kinda mad to experience how easy it can be for \"normal\" people. Wait, you mean you're doing all that impressive shit, not because I'm lazy and you're a paragon of self-discipline, but because you can just do things you're thinking of?!?!",

There are different ways that executive dysfunction can present itself, but for ADHD people it manifests as a marked inability to \u201cdo stuff.\u201d For some people like me, it genuinely feels like the parts of my brain responsible for (a) recognizing a task needs to be done, (b) planning how to do the task, and (c) actually executing the plan for doing the task (I\u2019m talking the most basic sense of \u201cmove my hand from point A to point B\u201d) are absolutely refusing to talk to each other. So I may recognize that a task needs to be done, and I recognize that I need to do something to do that task, but when I try to actually do something towards completing the task, my body stops responding. It is as though there is a physical switch in my muscles that I cannot control.\n\nAnd it is absolutely not just me being lazy because I don\u2019t want to do the dishes. Even deeply enjoyable tasks that I **want** to do suffer from this. Video games, books, tv, music, I can have a plan in my head ready to go for \u201cokay I will log on and play for an hour before bed\u201d end with me just sitting in my chair for an hour because when I try to log in my brain says \u201ccongratulations you have lost control of your arms!\u201d",

There are still many people with for example ADHD, who can do the things, there's just some resistance, but it's often easy once you actually start. I can handle way more chores now, pretty easily. It takes doing things repeatedly, seeing the good results and how easy it is, for it to get easier to start. But I also constantly betray myself and my plans. I can do a thing I shouldn't be doing for hours, saying \"just 5 more minutes\" or, \"Ok, now stop.\" to very unhealthy levels. I've lost many hours of sleep and taken way too long to do some assignments. But it's always a choice. Imo, it always feels like a choice.\n\nPeople on Tumblr talk like everyone with these conditions are physically kept from doing things and it's 24/7 torture with no escape, completely hopeless, but that's not true? Though It's different for everyone, I don't think making people think they should feel hopeless or assume they're also like that is good. ? Ofc talking about your experiences online is ok, but idk??? Hello? Am I alone here??\n\nJust forcing myself to do things works. Physically move your body to do it. If that doesn't work, it's a physical problem. I promise, I know suffering. You can say \"It doesn't get easier for me, it never does.\", but I have also said that before.\n\nIs there an even more severe version of executive dysfunction I don't know about?
