I use squares and right angles a lot in my art, but mostly bc I\u2019m working on illustrating a story about a totalitarian tech future, so i guess it might just be me",

It is forced to stare right at the object within it. A circular frame also has that effect, but it feels both less brutal because of the lack of angles, and more secretive, like it partially hides what it shows.",
