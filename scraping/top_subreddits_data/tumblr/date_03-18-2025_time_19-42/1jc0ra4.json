The rapid diversification of lifeforms in the Cambrian, known as the Cambrian explosion, produced the first representatives of all modern animal phyla. At that time, a creature was being created in the Inner Sea of the Planet, the Brain of the Planet known as Archetype: Earth. It was set to inherit the planet's memories and become its brain. As such, its appearance was based on the Primes Species of the time, animals known as \u201cAnomalocaris\u201d. The first known predator in the history of life, reigning over the oceans like tyrants, nothing was able to stand in their way.\n\n>The prototype of all predators.\n\n>As the Cambrian period continued to thrive, life on the planet started to stabilise. Until suddenly, everything started dying out. The death of a distant star wiping out most of the biodiversity of Earth. From death came death, and Anomalocaris went extinct.\n\n>The stillborn Archetype was cast off, no longer fit to represent the Planet.\n\n>However, it was repurposed.\n\n>Even though it couldn't become the Brain of Earth, it could still be used. Its body was based on the first apex predator, it was born when organisms known as \"animals\" first appeared on the planet. Thus, it was decided that she would serve as an anti-animalia agent, with the absolute privilege of slaying them\u2014the unparalleled beast of the waters.\n\n>Earth's personal apex predator.",
