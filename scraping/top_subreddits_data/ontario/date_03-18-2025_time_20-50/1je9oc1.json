I wonder if they weren't also pulling strings to kill WFH (alongside the office space realtors)\n\n\nBuilding roads for massed private transport makes you much more money than building public transport projects does. Just like making cars is far more lucrative than making buses. (To say nothing of\u00a0the endless cash cow of repairs for the asphalt mafia). We don't get the transport infrastructure we need - we get whatever pays for the execs' holidays and cottages.",

            "body": "Posted yesterday on Cycle TO's website:\n\nToday the Ontario Superior Court of Justice denied our injunction to stop the province from removing bike lanes in Toronto.\u00a0\n\n**While the decision is disappointing, it doesn\u2019t impact the bigger charter challenge and our chances of success on the merits of the case.**\u00a0The judge agreed that our case raises serious concerns about potential harm the lane removals could cause to cyclists. That hearing is scheduled for April 16th.\n\nIn court this week, however, new documents were released that belie the province\u2019s own statements that the legislation is in the public interest.\n\nIncluded among the documents were a government-commissioned report in late 2024 from engineering firm CIMA estimated that removing critical bike lane infrastructure would increase collisions by 54 per cent\u2013that\u2019s all collisions, not just people on bikes. Furthermore, removing the bike would lead to an increase in cyclists using sidewalks, creating hazards for pedestrians.\u00a0\n\nThe documents also show what we\u2019ve been saying all along: the proposed removal of the three downtown Toronto bike lanes would be unlikely to achieve Ontario\u2019s goal of reducing congestion and tackling traffic, a key claim repeated by the province without evidence to justify the legislation. Now we know even the province\u2019s own experts don\u2019t agree.\n\nOn the legal matter, the injunction outcome was based on the \u201cbalance of convenience,\u201d one component of a three-part test used by the Court to determine whether to grant an injunction. In cases like this one, where an applicant seeks to suspend the operation of validly passed legislation, the Court presumes that the legislation is in the public interest and serves a valid purpose.\u00a0\n\nBut from our perspective, nothing in the content of Ontario\u2019s documents is a surprise. MTO and their experts confirm what Cycle Toronto, advocates, and opponents to this legislation have been saying all along that:\n\n1) Ripping out bike lanes won't solve congestion and will make traffic worse\n\n2) There is no mythical network of secondary roads that could replace the target bike lanes\n\n3) Moving ahead with these removals will put people's lives at risk\n\nWhile we\u2019re not taking anything for granted, those documents, including high level conversations with Ministry of Transportation staff, also suggest that removal work isn\u2019t imminent in the next couple of weeks.\n\nWe remain confident and look forward to a full examination of the evidence at the hearing on April 16th.",
