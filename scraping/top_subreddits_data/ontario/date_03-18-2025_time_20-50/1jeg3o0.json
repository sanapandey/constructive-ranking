                            "body": "While it may seem like a bike lane will cause traffic, it has historically done the opposite.\n\nThere is simply no way to have enough roads in a dense urban area to support everyone driving their own car. Cars are the most space inefficient way of travelling. To get everyone where they need to go, you must have other means of transportation including buses, subways, pedestrians, bikes, etc.. The vast majority of cars are transporting 1 person. Think of the amount of space a car takes - not just the car, but the space needed around it and the parking required as well. In the space of 1 car lane, you could fit 2 bike lanes that could have 4-5 people each (8-10 people per 1 car).\n\nNow, you're probably thinking that many people won't bike, but they do. When bike lanes are built in a sufficiently large enough network and in a way that makes them safe, adoption increases dramatically. So while any one bike lane could cause more traffic in the short run, the overall building of bike lanes will definitely help reduce traffic.\n\nAlong with public transit, this is the only solution to traffic. There simply is not enough space in between the buildings to have enough lanes to move people by cars. Not only this, but adding highway lanes doesn't help as they are hindered by the bottleneck of the roads those cars must get off onto. A ton of research has gone into it and urban designers have been touting it for decades. However, every time, politicians try to score easy points by claiming bike lanes are causing traffic because it's an easy sell and an easy win despite praying on peoples ignorance.",

Wouldn't that solve both issues here?  I'm sure it can't be that simple, but I don't see an immediate reason why not.\n\nEdit... I don't live in Toronto, so forgive any naivety.",

They often have to zig zag between different streets and cross more unsafe intersections. In the end, people do not want this so they don't adopt biking. One of the major benefits of bike lanes is that once adoption picks up, it reduces the amount of cars on the road. To achieve this benefit the bike lanes can't just be messy, dangerous lanes that zig zag between parallel roads.",

Sometimes it actually makes car traffic better. So there's no reason to put bike lanes on side streets.",

And thus the argument becomes: why don't drivers use them, if they are a practical alternative to congestion on the arterials? The answer is that side streets are not replacements for arterials.",
