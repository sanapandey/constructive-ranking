It's a bit misleading imo to say that OP is \"lying\".\n\n\nI've seen gas prices vary more for a high demand weekend than for carbon pricing. Companies are going to charge whatever they can sell it at. The carbon and provincial gas taxes reduce (or redirect) their profitability, but we as consumers do not feel that.",

They're happy to keep prices artificially higher when possible to make that extra profit. And now that people are used to having gas in the ~$1.40 range instead of crying foul, gas companies may continue to charge generally higher prices.

That\u2019s an astonishing amount of infrastructure to maintain and a shocking amount of valuable land taken up to move a piddling amount of people. But it\u2019s more than just one highway. It\u2019s every multi-lane suburban road and extra wide residential street where public space is given away for free for private parking. This last sentence is really key... It's the reason why city taxes keep going up and the things cities can do keep going down. Auto infrastructure is a huge liability.\n\nIf someone paid the real costs of their trip on the 401, the 407 wouldn\u2019t look so expensive in comparison anymore\u2026 that\u2019s a subsidy. When something is subsidized for so long (driving), people literally can not fathom the real costs once they become apparent. For example: the costs of maintaining the Gardiner in 2020 (before it was uploaded to the province) were 44% of the entire city transport capital budget. Some bus routes and streetcar lines move more people daily than that highway.\n\nWhen people make this argument, you have to place driving in the same category as all other types of transit. If we want to move people in the most space and cost effective way, driving is dead last. The fact that it\u2019s possible to do without going bankrupt is only because of subsidies.\n\nCongestion and traffic is not just the cost of doing business as a big city. Many global cities have much more people per sq ft than Toronto and manage to get around quite well. We have congestion and traffic and horrible public finances because we love driving and can't see an alternative (although there are many).",

All the extra lanes don't benefit me in any way.\n\nAlso, if you internalize the costs of driving, then I'd be paying for exactly the cost I impose on freight and maintenance people and such instead of paying taxes so that we can do just one more lane bro on yet another stroad or freeway.\n\nAnother point I'll add is that the public should subsidize buses, hospitals, and trains because they're all good for society. Cars are bad for society, so we should not subsidize them. It's like asking whether we should subsidize smoking",
