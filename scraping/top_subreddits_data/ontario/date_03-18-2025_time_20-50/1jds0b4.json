                                                    "body": "You are not understanding Brookfield at all. For starters, you are confusing Brookfield Asset Management, a subsidiary, with Brookfield Corporation, the parent, which is still headquartered jointly in Toronto and NYC, as it always was. These companies were always cross-border, with tickers on both American and Canadian exchanges. Brookfield Corporation has numerous subsidiaries with numerous branches in countries across the world, mostly owning and building the backbone of their economy, the infrastructure they need to move to the future. They bypass risks like tariff by being present in, and working directly in the countries, rather than trading across the border. The asset management business is the lifeline that enables so much of this local investment, but by being a separate subsidiary, remains at an arms length from the other subsidiaries, and again, allows them to bypass tariffs and taxes. The move by BAM to go to US is mostly symbolic sofar as Brookfield corporation is concerned. It just allows them better access to private equity in US. If you have a private equity business that funds so much of the rest of your operation, you want that business to be in a place where the most private equity is available. Their success is the success of Brookfield Corporation, and that is Canada's success.\n\nMark Carney could have tried to explain all that to you and other people criticizing the move, but sadly, the average Griffin just won't understand that level of corporate complexity.\n\nEdit: Also, our GDP went up under Trudeau despite extremely difficult economic challenges. It was under the second term of Harper (2013-2015) that our GDP per capita took a huge nose dive, and Trudeau reversed that trend.\n\nEdit Edit: It's their money, not \"they're money\"",
