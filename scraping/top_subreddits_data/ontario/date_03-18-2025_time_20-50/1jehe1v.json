And I guess even when he eats shit and acquiesces to Trump, the media is still here to wrap it up as a Doug win? \n\nHow is this our news?",

Considering the deep costs to the Canadian economy, dollar for dollar tarriffs are really only an opening move, and is largely a significant tax increase to Canadians that will help support writing cheques to support and slow down job loses.\n\nDoug Ford is playing the part of rope a dope. It's about causing short term political damage to Trump while managing damage to the home team.\n\nThe only reason why Ontario is able to punch out with electricity surcharges - which is really about headlines then real damage - is because the IESO has already identified the need for a massive build out of electricity generation i.e. what we are selling has a use by date because eventually our own increases in load will wipe out the surplus. Quebec is not doing the surcharge threat. Ontario can easily make this threat in the short term have it be rope a dope; on/off strikes. Ontario's electricity surcharge does not have the capacity to make a large difference, and we don't want to upset the potential for electro-dollar USD income long term with a client that is super sensitive to national security concerns.\n\nNone of this is new. This is the tick - tock of Canadian-American relations and is not surprising at all. Ontario has been fighting bi partisan USA protectionism since Obama. \n\nDoug Ford can do his \"folks we just want to keep prices low for Americans\" good cop/bad cop routine. Clearly the intention is to keep Carney from meeting Trump until after we have a new Federal mandate, likely at the G7. Ultimately the job of a Federal PM is 1) bi national unity & 2) US relationship mgmt. Everything else comes after these core elements.\n\nI don't know if you've noticed by we are keeping our guy from doing another Trump visit till after we get a proper mandate for our Federal PM.\n\nI think you're perspective is coloured by significant bias and not looking at the game board as a whole , so to speak.\n\nIf you know Canadian history, US security issues and tariffs and trade wars have dominated Canadian politics notably in 1866, 1891, 1911, 1958/1963, 1984/1988 elections.\n\nExpect the Feds to drop dollar for dollar tariffs eventually, because increasing the cost of aluminum cans by 50% (for example) due to double taxation isn't going to work in the long run. Unless we get busy writing cheques to subsidy industrial production from the extra taxation which would just bake in higher costs.\n\nTLDR: Canadian trade negotiation is notorious for one thing. Randomly backing out & debating the details until the other side says uncle (Freelands main skill was to talk endlessly about minute stuff, remember Canada dragged its feet all through NAFTA 2.0 talking about asinine stuff until the American's made it clear if we didn't stop they'd sign NAFTA 2.0 with just Mexico and freeze us out- we signed the next day). Trudeau famously walked away last minute from signing the TPP deal and pissed off especially Japans for the last minute 180. He didn't do it as an \"whoopsie\" they did it from a calculated attempt to get higher ground or last minute gains. It's always Hustle then slow walk, then hustle, then walk away, then slow walk, with Trade Deals. Lots of trade deals take decades off walking away and restarting talks. Fuck even the EU deal isn't finished finished and that goes back to middle of Harpers period in office.",

Trump only knows how to say the words that get him cheers in public: \"kill NAFTA\" \"bitcoin\" \"Drain the swamp\" \"Coal\" His entire platform is based on what \"sold\" at his rallys.\n\nYou make a threat to 1) play the propaganda war, the threat for the surcharge was very consequential because it got Canada into the middle of the US media cycle which is not something Canada ever gets. It got Ford on American media acting his part, which is him shaking his head saying awh jeez we just want to bring costs down for both of us and we can all make money, this is \"all Trumps fault, he's a smart guy but who ever is around him is telling him some bad stuff\" all while the stock market is in free fall which Trump watches. \\*i.e It was a direct attack on Howard Lutnick. \\*\n\nI suspect campaign 1 in the trade war for Canada is to get Lutnick tossed. And getting the people in the Court of Trump tossed, is actually relatively easy. Trump tossed people easily. This is how you wage a 4 year trade war, you snipe the people around Trump who are the most protectionist first.\n\nThe Canadian position is generally: we don't give a fuck what you do inside the US republic, that would be foreign interference if we did. This is a long standing policy. We don't give a fuck what you do to other States. All we really care about is winning the long term war which is rooted in fundamentals that are very hard to change (because of geography): and that's getting \\*special access\\* to the US. We don't want the same access as everyone else. In the age of neoliberal WTO globalized free trade (i.e capital is global; people are local) we lost our special access to the US republic. Mexico has eaten half our manufacturing jobs since 1991.\n\nWe don't know yet what global order we are really fighting for, NORAD & NATO (absolutely yes, NAFTA 3.0, maybe not) but the status quo is gone and the world keeps turning and all we care about is playing the game to win in the long term. And the game is Canada gets special access. It's a game we've played since 1866 on/off.\n\nDoug Ford understands that Mexico has deindustralized Ontario significantly. Canada is at a very serious risk of losing it's special relationship with the US to Mexico. Mexico \"bolts\" onto the American growth model better then Canada. It wasn't that long a go I was listening to a retired CIBC banker on TVO say he doesn't understand why the elites selling out Canadian jobs to Mexico isn't more of a discussion in Canada.\n\nReally the original sin in all of this was expanding Canada-US FTA to Mexico. Both Trump and Sanders were dead set on killing NAFTA because of the effect on deindustralizing the heartland.\n\n\nEdit: while Mexico \"bolts\" on to the US growth model better, Mexico could never be the \"beloved 51st state\" we have always been the dreamy 'one that got away' for the US Republic\u00a0",

Decades of work and progress that largely came from being the most steadfast ally any time there was a Cold War crisis, which goes back to the days we had a real military and deployed troops frequently, was basically all just handed to Mexico in NAFTA cause this was the \"new world order\" and the name of the game was capitalizing on all that raw resources held behind the Iron Curtain dumping onto the global market in 1991 - we got lots of resources, all we need is to crush labour. Hence the era of the Free Trade Agreement and the WTO. And we got 30 years of declining prices in real terms in product markets, stagnate wages across Canada-US, and alarming price increases for assets and services (which is largely how the rich get richer) So it's been great for the elites who buy material stuff and sell assets & services.\n\nHowever, you can't be a global super power when your number one employer is walmart and everyone buys cheap shit with declining real wealth, decade over decade. Canada and the US are in the same boat here.\n\nMy point is there is a bi partisan consensus in the states that the status quo is debased and will be dismantled. Only the brain dead Democratic establishment is drifting off into la la land unwilling to chart a new course. It's the very reason why they knifed Bernie Sanders and we got this neo-con dip shit engineering for the new world order instead.\n\nUnlike the last time, the game is now about the new world order, not tweaks to the old.

Their loyalty is to filling column inches with predictable consistency, and you do that by uncritically reporting \"this is what he said\" day in day out.\n\nThe other bias is to keeping people coming back, and you do *that* with opinion articles.  Everyone who's spent 5 minutes on the web knows emotional engagement through bold or contrarian assertions is a far better payout than intellectual critique, and so opinion columnists keep the clicks coming with big swings.\n\nSo it's not that \"the media coddles Ford\", it's that the is financial incentives drive the current events reporting to be bland, and the op-ed columnists to be bombastic... resulting in a news media landscape that has nothing substantive to say about Ford and everything to say about a local cafe owner that is offering pumpkin spice products out of season.",
