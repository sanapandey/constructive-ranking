    "selftext": "More specifically, would you welcome never-Trumper American tourists who are doing everything they possibly can to resist the current US administration? My husband (52M) and I (47F) haven\u2019t taken a vacation in forever, and may do so this summer. I am feeling compelled to support our neighbors. I understand if the current political climate means we\u2019re all guilty by association and thus probably unwelcome, but I just wanted to ask, and also for you to know that *most* of us are **NOT** on board with what\u2019s going on here. Thanks so much either way.\n\n**Edited to add:** Holy moly! I didn\u2019t expect this big of a response at all, let alone the super warm welcome (for the most part), and I am very grateful. Wanted to just say a few things:\n\n- For those who have made comments about my failure to use the search function, I\u2019m sorry. I did a quick skim and did not see this question, so I asked it. I should have searched first. Didn\u2019t mean to waste anyone\u2019s time. \n\n- For those who expressed skepticism that I am doing everything I can, I mean I am protesting, incessantly calling reps and senators, donating money to races not even in my state, boycotting, and voicing my opposition every way I can as often as I can. I know it\u2019s still not enough, but I don\u2019t know what else to do. There is no one central resistance, but lots of smaller efforts gaining steam. A lot of it is not on mainstream media, but turns up in small local papers and channels. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a massive well-organized movement (yet), but it is happening. We have no leadership right now, and that makes it harder. You know when you mix oil and water and shake it up, how all those little oil beads will eventually find each other and stick together again? That\u2019s my sense of what\u2019s happening. \n  \n- I promise, I do not own a MAGA hat \u2014 or even anything with an American flag on it. Never have. \n\n- I would never make a 51st state joke. I don\u2019t even have words for the arrogance and disrespect he shows by threatening such a thing.\n\nThanks again to those who were so welcoming, and apologies to those who took offense. My intention was just to be respectful and try to understand what you all want vs just assuming. \n",

There are always exceptions, of course, but they mostly just prove the rule. \n\nI don\u2019t think any sane person in Canada has a grudge against everyday Americans just because they\u2019re Americans.

Or you could do the Ottawa Valley and experience the city as you cottage just outside of the main areas.  The nice thing with Ottawa is that you can be 30 minutes away but still fairly peaceful.  Then you can hit up museums, parliament, food and market style areas that are a good summer destination.  Lots of shopping too if you\u2019re into that.   \n\nSome other quick hits that you could google to see if it\u2019s up your alley\n- Algonquin National Park\n- Prince Edward County (a personal favourite of mine)\n- Bruce Peninsula National Park\n- Killarney National Park\n- Thousand Islands (another favourite and right along the US border with lots of small towns / cities to travel along)\n- Tobermory\n\nThose places are all very scenic, mostly quiet, lots of outdoor activities.",

                            "body": "In terms of what else to do, in my opinion, Americans need to talk to their friends and family who are burying their heads in the sand - in person, as long as it's not dangerous. It's hard, harder than calling representatives and harder than posting online. It will be a long, slow process and it won't pay off for everyone. Most people need to look up and practice how to do it effectively. But with 1/3 of the population supporting what's going on and another 1/3 opposing anyone who rocks their boat, the people trying to make things better need to convince some of the others to join them. I saw a video recently that I really recommend, \"Why empathetic people keep losing\" by HGModernism (it's more optimistic than the title). I think it explains why a lot of people are willing to be misled and that's a good start for how to approach them. And get other people to do the same thing.\n\nThat's just my opinion. A lot of Canadians want Americans to, at the very least, stage protests in DC much larger than the largest protests the U.S. has had in the past. A million people attended March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation - more should be protesting now. There would be risk to the protesters, but there's an argument to be made that the longer they wait, the harder it gets for the US to change course. But I personally think that getting more people to understand what's at stake has to happen first. But Americans need to decide when they have no other choice but stronger action, as well.",
