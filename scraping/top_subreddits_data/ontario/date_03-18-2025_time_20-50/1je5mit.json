    "selftext": "A colleague of mine pointed out why he took his child in Georgetown out of French Immersion and it has me incensed enough to yell into the void (having an ADHD rage moment) \n\nHe took his girl in grade 4 out of French Immersion because he can't get her home safely without driving her there and back every day. They now have 3 kids, with a 4th on the way, and can't get them all back and forth every day. I ask \"aren't there buses?\" To which he replies \"no buses for that school.\" \n\nWhy would the school not have buses? Too expensive? Why are we not funding schools to have buses in a medium sized community like Georgetown? How is this not an outrage?\n\nAlso, why can't she walk? Oh right because car centric infrastructure makes it deadly for her to be a child AND go to school, necessitating driving her back and forth every day. Again, how is this not an outrage?\n\nIt makes me reflect on my own experience having been in French Immersion. I was fortunate enough to only have 1 very safe crosswalk grades 1-5 and 1 very safe side street crossing grades 6-8 (at which point I was old enough to know how to cross a street safe)\n\nSo here's a gainfully employed middle class family who struggled enough to buy a house, with soon to be 4 kids, all of whom are now permanently unable to access jobs requiring proper bilingualism. Good luck working for the government without French. Good luck working on a dozen fields of expertise in Canada which often require fluent French. Goodbye benefits gained from being bilingual at a young age. \n\nBecause:\n1. Not enough taxes / misallocated taxes (provincial and municipal) to pay for buses at the schools.\n2. Our insistence to continue building communities for cars instead of families and children resulting in unsafe streets, requiring buses or people driving their kids everywhere. Side note: There is a huge developmental cost to this. No independence and cooped up in safe managed spaces at all times is not the ideal environment for children. All because our streets are not safe for kids, but great for cars. \n\nEnd of keyboard rage.",

            "body": "Are they out of the catchment zone for the school?  Normally bussing would be provided for all students in the catchment area if the distance is too far to walk.  Some schools will let you attend from outside the catchment area, but you must provide your own transportation.\n\nAlso, really wondering which school. I went to Google Maps and did streetview around a few schools in Georgetown, and there seems to be decent enough pedestrian infrastructurer. Sidewalks on both sides of the road with some schools having bike lanes. Most of the schools look to be on reasonably quiet residential streets.",

Picked an address somewhat far away and across busy Guelph Street from George Kennedy, the French Immersion school in Georgetown. 20 Harding St is 3km from the school and is eligible for busing for French Immersion.\n\nSo poster and his friend are angry that the schoolboard   expects kids to walk farther than they think is acceptable. Who is car brained now?\n\nGrade 4 kids are actually able to do lots of things by themselves and navigate traffic. We're not talking about 5 year olds heading off to senior kindergarten. \n\nI suggest therapy for the parent and poster and letting the lod walk to school as the professionals are suggesting.",

How about ripping up the entire \"main street\" of Georgetown and make a downtown like they would have in 1900 where people moved through the town and not an endless stream of cars.

Most of Canada is car oriented suburbia, we need safer roads and safer cities. That means more walkability, safer crossings, traffic calming(especially at intersections), making turns sharper, narrowing lanes, confining the road trees or buildings closer up, all these things make roads safer, especially for pedestrians. We know this, its been proven by countless studies, there is so much we could be doing but we arent in order to prioritize traffic speeds, but we don't. We value a few minutes of commute more than kids lives, but we keep building everything further apart causing the long commutes in the first place. Cities in other parts of the world don't have such high road deaths because they actually use the urban planning tools we're too afraid to use. Look at Hoboken in New jersey for example, hasn;t had a single traffic death in years because they actually implemented some of hose tools.",

Making these new roads safer for anyone not in a car.\n\n3. When a road needs to be repaired or fixed / repaved, rather than just repaving it the same way, you spend a little more to bring it up to the spec outlined in point #1.

Commute times aren't affected in any significant way if you have a properly designed city / town. This would eliminate the need for crossing guards on 90% of intersections. Some would still be needed at the busiest streets ofc. The traffic flow has to go somewhere. \n\nMost of the local traffic is eliminated by proper design because people will walk to the grocery store, walk to the park, bike to the ice cream shop or whatever the hell they want to do because you don't need to drive anywhere.

Which generally just means anywhere not Canada and the US. I'm sure you have so I'm not talking to a wall.\n\nIn the best examples, kids have more independence. Go where they want, do what they want (within reason ofc). All of this by cycling or walking. This goes for adults too. Less need to drive to the grocery store, less need to drive to get ice cream, go to the soccer field, go to the park. Whatever. This, as a result, reduces traffic and subsequently any danger that traffic caused. \n\nIf your contention is that Georgetown is even remotely like any of these places and is \"just fine\" the way it is, that's great. Means literally nothing that can be done to make Georgetown better. It's perfect. \n\nYou're like 1 question away from completely proving why car centric infrastructure sucks for everyone. \"Schools around pickup and drop-off times can be hectic and busy\". Why are they busy? What if you didn't need to drive your kids back and forth to school?. What if 75-90% of kids (that aren't already walking) walked home instead of being driven. Would it be as hectic? Would there be as many cars? Would there be as much danger? \n\nProblems with vehicles and traffic are problems for the safety of children. And the safety of literally anyone not in a car. That's my entire point. Our infrastructure favors cars instead of people. \n\nThe people of Georgetown would change their minds as infrastructure that favors people instead of cars is built. Sure the busiest streets would still have crossing guards. I'm not against crossing guards, just their current absolute necessity due to the danger of traffic. Changes like this don't happen all at once. It's a 10-20 year process.\n\nThis isn't an attack on you or on Georgetown per se. It's an attack on car infrastructure in general, simply reflected in Georgetown's planning. It could have been done differently. It could have been centered on people but it wasn't. We can all advocate for changing that trajectory.",

Shouldn't be necessary everywhere or as rampantly as they are needed. To me crossing guards are not an indication of safety, they are a band-aid solution indicative of an infrastructure problem. \n\n. Below are some basic urbanist points reiterated all over urbanist YouTube but I will say them just in case you don't live or watch in that algorithmic niche. Not my ideas, I like them, but regurgitating.\n\n1. Many cities existed in canada before cars. YouTube has some great videos of what Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal used to look like. People walking everywhere. Street cars etc. it looked very European back then (at the very least very 19th century American). Montreal still has dense housing in much of the city still because they didn't build single family homes everywhere. This is part of why it's more affordable there (but won't be forever but that's another discussion entirely) as well as much more liveable without a car.\n\n\n2. We like our cars because of manufactured consent via car company propaganda and lobbying in the 50s. (I like my car too but hate HAVING to use it). It's more of a Stockholm syndrome situation  than a true preference. This is why the thought of bike lanes is somehow objectionable to people here. My partners",

Of those, [347 of them](https://emploisfp-psjobs.cfp-psc.gc.ca/psrs-srfp/applicant/page2440?tab=1&title=&locationsFilter=&departments=&officialLanguage=1&referenceNumber=&selectionProcessNumber=&search=Search%20jobs&log=false) are open to people who only speak English. \n\nHaving said that, there are probably many roles where being bilingual will give you an advantage over other applicants, and I've heard that being bilingual is more or less required if you want to advance beyond a certain level (though the federal government will pay for language trainig if you work for them, which helps a lot.)\n\nOverall, I agree that speaking both official languages is useful, and makes it much easier to truly immerse youuself and have a good time when you visit Quebec. Its usefulness in the job market, though, depends a ton on what field you want to work in. I spent a lot of time working for tech companies in Ottawa, and being bilingual wasn't something we even considered in applicants. Probably different if you're working in a tech company in Montreal, though.\n\nAnd on a personal, I continue studying French even in my 40s because I love and appreciate Quebec and want to be a good guest when I visit.",

The people there are more Canadian that most of us stupid ontarians who mostly are just wannabe Americans (except ofc for when they actually threaten to bring us into the fold). \n\nTheir social cohesion is better, their social services are better. They have more equality. Its only a few people in the cities that point their nose down on bilingual / English people that give them a bad rap. Most ppl there are super chill.",
