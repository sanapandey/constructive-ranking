Fun fact: the last tour of that facility was a couple years ago, now it's shut down except for maintenance personnel mostly because it's full of nasty shit that they used to build with in the 50s. The radar data is mostly sent south now for the actual \"stare at a radar screen like in 80s Navy movies\" work.\n\nThe air force base that's on top of the hill is mostly just that: an air force base. They run some logistics for the NWS still, and the operations office across from the base, but few military personnel occupy it. 20% USAF sounds about right but it's like 20 military people total.. the rest of the base is not USAF to my knowledge, but I work for NWS not for the base so I could be wrong on that. I just don't know what USAF would be doing on a CAF base that isn't the NWS.",
