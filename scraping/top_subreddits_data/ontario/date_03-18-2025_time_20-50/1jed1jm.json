We can't win this war, but we can maybe get to a cease fire and a lack of desire to do it again for a while\n\nIf we allow them to dripfeed these tariffs at their leisure and in the industries they choose, they'll utterly crush us in the long term. Because as bad as nuclear is in the short term, having it just drip feed in over a long period of time with no recourse is absolutely worse\n\nPut another way - what possible reason would the US government have to \\*not\\* continue to do this, beyond the damage we can do to their economy? There are no tools in our pocket beyond this, not a single one. And the more time we give them, and more weakness we show, the more they'll feel like they can come at us harder",

If their end goal here is conquering the entire country, what tools do we have in our pocket to use appropriately against that end goal? We appease them by giving them what they want and then what? We have one way of hurting them, and it's temporary - and that's hurting their economy while it still depends on ours. Setting up trade with other countries is not a short term thing, so if anything, getting them to back off for a bit is what we need. The alternative is let them select which parts of the economy to destroy with no push back and just escalate as they see fit\n2. They \\*do\\* care about some things. They are funded by their donors, which are businesses and people. People suddenly out of work or whose investments are worth alot less and bushiness suddenly hurting who blame the party \\*will\\* put pressure on the party, and that means funding. They will care about that. Maybe not enough, but it's something, and basically the only weapon we have.\n\nI don't think this is some easy win, I think we're fucked either way tbh. But I think punching them on the nose while we can is the only play. Anything else is just letting them decide how and when they want to crush us, as they can crush us. If we stand to lose either way, then there's no consequences to fear, blow them up and hope it hurts them enough to back off\n\nThey absolutely were rattled by the electricity, for example. Trump tweeted about it constantly and they hauled Doug in for a meeting immediately. And we just rolled over. Give them enough time and the electricity threat won't carry that weight.\n\n\"When waging war with a Individual that has no care for the people, laws, countries etc, especially one as powerful as the states, best not piss them off right at the start.\"\n\nThis is where we fundamentally differ. I'd argue history has emphatically taught us the opposite - appeasement does not work. They will always want more, and take weakness as a sign it's there to be taken",

Here we care how it effects the people, there,  they don't.   They'll step on a baby to get another penny.  Tariffs aren't the answer because this isn't a trade war built on logic and reason. It's all based on lies and excuses to justify doing whatever he wants. Trump isn't listening to Americans, he's listening to the richest man in the world, musk, who has no care for anything other than literally draining the government coffers into his own pocket, and putin, who wants the USA cheap and out of power.   Again, they are declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction to justify invading.... higher tariffs will just make the war get here faster.
