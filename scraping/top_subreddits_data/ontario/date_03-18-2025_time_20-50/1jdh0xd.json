The price increases seen here would be directly as a result of counter-tariffs our government has applied.  It\u2019s not the retailer\u2019s job to explain to us how that all works and why it\u2019s happening.\n\nNo love here for the Weston group of companies, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if they took this opportunity to try to squeeze more out of us than they should.  However, some of their products will see price increases due to OUR counter-tariffs, and it\u2019s their choice to forward that cost to the consumer.  No need to dig for outrage, there\u2019s plenty just laying around on the floor right now.",

We may not be able to find alternatives for everything, so we will mark products from America with US, and we will mark products that are affected by Tariffs with this symbol.",
