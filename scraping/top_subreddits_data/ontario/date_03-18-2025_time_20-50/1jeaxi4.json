Like project 25 for example, even though it's been played out. Or the fact that now he's bombing Yemen and ordered the US military to seize the Panama canal, or the immigrants who said they'd never be deported even if they have green cards who just happened to end up back in their home countries... \n\nYou see what I'm saying right? So \"joking\" aside or not, maybe be prepared just in case. Because they've also admitted that they want to take us by economic force which is why tariffs are happening in the first place. Make us need to rely on them and in return we have to give them XYZ. Both trump, his administration and many government officials have said this",

He likes powder better anyways, but he has A LOT of mob and gang tied people that have A LOT of shit on him. The blackmail on that man is insane. This is why he's so crooked now, keeps giving contracts to companies that have a fuck ton of sketchy people behind the scenes and robbing us of taxpayer money. \n\nDoug is a fucking grade A moron, although people may be impressed with how he's handled things so far I can guarantee you that if he's offered enough cash or anything else of worth, he will turn on Ontario faster than you can say tariffs. He's also not the brightest bulb and takes a lot of things people say at face value. There's a reason why everyone still loved to sell to him and Rob, they'll believe anything you say/you can undercut everything and you don't even have to put in effort about it either.",
