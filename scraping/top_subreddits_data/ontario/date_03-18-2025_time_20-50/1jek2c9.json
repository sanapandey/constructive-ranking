What do you think I can do in three days itinerary? I was planning to know Toronto on day one, then go to Ottawa on day two, what do you think ",

Even just travelling around in the greater city of Toronto can take a bit of time.\n\n\nTypically touristy things are the CN tower, Toronto Island, and Ripley aquarium. I'm sure people more familiar with Toronto can help you out :)",

There's also the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) nearby as well, and just the streets to explore is nice. Trust me, Ottawa isn't worth it, the parking is ass and it's way overhyped. You'll have an awesome time in Toronto alone, just make sure to get some street meat from one of the hotdogs stands, stellar food",

It is a tourist town, the entire place screams tourist and there are literally tourist taxes added on to your bill. Personally a hard pass for me as I think they made the area VERY tacky, if you look up \"Niagara Falls Tourist Town\" you'll see what I'm talking about based on the images. It's like Vegas flashy but it's almost all kid oriented. If that's your vibe, sure go for it. It's about a 2 hour drive there and back, so 4 hours total. But I'd personally push hard for Toronto Zoo instead of Niagara falls unless you really want to see the falls.",

That should probably eat a good chunk of your day and still give you time with grandma. Casa Loma is also a great time, maybe go there with her.\n\nAnother day can be eaten by Toronto Zoo (They have some awesome exhibits showcasing North American animals) or Tommy Thompson park and the Scarborough bluffs if you prefer to be outdoors, There's also the Eaton Center and Yorkdale mall if you want a fun mall trip. For the scariest experience of your life go to Union Station and get lost in the underground mall (AKA Path) thats a hell of a trip.\n\nFinally, ask you grandma what her favourite spots are if you haven't. She probably knows just about everything, especially the best restaurants. I think you'll have a great time without leaving Toronto personally. Ontario is massive and the driving takes a lot out of you. As someone that lives in this province and has done it all, I'd be more excited for a full 3 days in Toronto than a driving day trip anywhere.",

If you want to see Ottawa, plan a couple days. You can hike some local trails, visit Hull (city across the river from Ottawa), see some political buildings if you like that sort of thing, go to one of the museums, catch a festival, play pinball...  There is lots to do here. But it would suck to drive a few hours, look at parliament, and drive back.",
