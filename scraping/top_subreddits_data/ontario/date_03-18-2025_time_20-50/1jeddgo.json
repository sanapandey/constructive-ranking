Tax incidence depends on the elasticity of supply and demand. The only time a tax would be entirely paid for by the consumer is if the supply is infinitely elastic. So it appears only about 8-10 cents per litre of the consumer carbon tax was actually paid for by the consumer.",

Wouldn't surprise me in the least if 'recent global trade instability' is used as a pretext to keep prices where they are. The only thing removing these taxes (gas tax and carbon tax) is going to accomplish is lining the pockets of oil company shareholders and executives.",
