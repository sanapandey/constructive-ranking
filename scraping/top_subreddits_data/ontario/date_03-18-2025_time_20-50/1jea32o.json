The US aluminum tariffs are still on. Did the Americans pull a fast one on him? \n\nOr was Doug told by our Feds to pull back? Was he overstepping into federal jurisdiction ? ",

He started out on all the US TV shows telling the US public how we feel about what they were doing and how he thought we could work together more effectively.

So he gathered some folks...had an information booklet printed and camped out in Washington almost begging for a meeting with Senators or anyone willing to speak with him and his team...some polite talks but really no interest...because he wasn't the one with the oil...So he returns home for the election and the US slaps the tariffs on Steel and Aluminum.  Again he tried to reach out to try to set up a meeting and was again met with crickets...So he pulled out the...big guns... and like magic...he got his meeting.  I don't really think he honestly thought he could get the tariffs tolled back or removed I think he wanted to know what their goal was and how he...Ontario...Canada could support them in achieving that goal.  So he got his meeting and he and 2 Federal Ministers and our Ambassador attend this meeting.  All of them came out of that meeting saying they got clarity on what the goal and direction was for the US.  All said it was one of the best meetings so far.  So Ford returns to Ontario...meets with Carey..and hangs back a bit.  I think there is a larger plan going on here and we will see it unfold if...when...Carney is elected PM.  So I look at it as Ford achieving what he has always wanted...to talk about how we can deal with these tariffs with the US and I think he got the answers he was looking for as did others.",

The feds staying quiet and letting the provinces run wild could be a strategy. Ford may have had Trudeau\u2019s full support for that response. If so, Carney may have a different strategy.\u00a0\n\nWe know Ford is crooked as fuck, but the GOP is, too. I\u2019m inclined to think that nothing happened at the meeting.

As with all conservative businessmen, he thinks politics is the same as business, which it absolutely isn't. \n\nHis rhetoric lives in a completely different reality. There was never any chance he was going to withhold electricity. He will end up grovelling to get scraps from their table.\n\nSo no, he wasn't played, we were.",
