And in turn, had an infinite quick charge which is his main source of damage. \n\nOr some character's having their damage capped released after dodge cancels for skills and such.",

            "body": "Probably to go back to bugged movesets. \n\nI think it was every character, but it was primarily Caglisostro or The Captain, but basically if you dodge with a projectile in mid air but before it hits the target, the damage cap was simply removed to the hard cap of 9,999,999. A Stage 4 captain skill ( i forget the name its been so long since i played) and the right build would do like 10 hits of 9,999,999. \n\nIt could also be that it was when Dodge Cancel meta was a thing and was crucial to the play styles of Percival and Vaseraga. In the case of Percival he was the highest damaging character in the game because his spinny-fire wheel skill dodge canceled made it crazy and could spam his max charged hit multiple times or something like that. Vaseraga could dodge cancel moves in his standard charge combos to get his biggest hits out faster.\n\nOtherwise, compatibility with certain mods? Maybe? Since the game isn't updated by the devs anymore i would understand if the modding community dipped out but I could be wrong",

You could definitely also abuse quick charge, which was fun and cool and they should've kept it like they introduced execution cancel to Sieg, who arguably didn't need it.",
