    "selftext": "After roughly 70 hours in Wilds, having complete all main quests, all side quests and all post-game quests, and farmed a perfect artian weapon paralysis build.\n\n[Me and my Paralysis Lance Gore build in MH Wilds](https://preview.redd.it/fi6g8qy64joe1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=049b09a60737859ac17753fb5077e26234d8f5ca)\n\nWith completely maxed out endgame armor and full decorations, which I guess could be slightly better but lets say 95% done, I just realise I am not running out of materials but I am running out of fun in Monster Hunter.\n\nSure the mechanics of Monster Hunter are WAY more in depth, the budget was a lot bigger, you can do so much differnent shit that Granblue just doesnt offer us. Like catching monsters instead of killing them, going fishing, catching local wildlife, cooking minigames, talking to everyone, dual monsters, spray-painting your rideable dinosaur. \n\nBut the grindset that motivates you to do the same single Bahamut battle for 6 hours a day is just not there. In Granblue we had to farm the endgame weapons for every character and it sucked, we went in with randoms and had to listen to the epic Bahamut battle song and we all goofed off and spammed emoji while we waited for this stupid dragon to finally shoot his stupid dragonlaser. And after an hour you finally got a weapon but not for the character you like.\n\nIn Monster Hunter Wilds, this is somewhat the same with Artian Weapons, where you have to find 3 weapon parts with the same element (only paralysis and explosion are worth, rest is trash) and either atk or crit rate as main stat (rest is trash again). For the fastest way to get the artian weapons you also have to defeat that games final boss \"bahamut\" again and again. And you repeat it until you have the correct pieces, then you upgrade them and while upgrading the thing can go to shit again and you start over. But principle is the same. Hunt the final boss.\n\nHowever in Monster Hunter we just lack the likeable Granblue characters. In Monster Hunter Wilds, there is exactly two characters that you love, and thats your Palico (your own cat that fights with you) and Rowe, a wise wizard cat that is super awesome and cool with the only downside is having not enough screentime. Your Palico being a cute little sidekick that saves you from death fills essentially the role of Vyrn.\n\n[Vyrn is always there for us](https://preview.redd.it/7fclm5eo6joe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50dfb0ffe4460a101b83098114d56974a119f1fe)\n\nAll other characters are barely memoriseable. Booby smith lady and the nerd girl that sleeps in your tent with you.\n\nNow, if you want to switch things up in Granblue, you switch your main from Katalina to Yodarha and the difference is night and day. The characters play completely different, and have different voicelines, different personality, and everyone has a little 10 chapter long side story just for them.\n\nIf you want to switch things up in Wilds, you change your weapon. This is absolutely, AT LEAST as impactful on the gameplay as switching the character in Granblue. Maybe even more, the Monster Hunter Weapons are so unique and different from each other, it feels like you are playing a different game. Which is aweseome.\n\nBut not quite. Once you are in said endgame, if you want to switch your weapon, you instantly craft the best weapon of your new type, learn it in training mode for 30 minutes and then hunt monsters with your new weapon for a few hours and boom you got it. You are still the same character as before which is kind of boring compared to Granblue. Oh and in true Capcom fashion (thanks Dragons Dogma 2) you have to pay real world money if you want to change your characters appearance more than once. So cosplaying a new person everytime you switch weapons is not feasible.\n\nAt least in Monster Hunter you can switch between your two main weapons in the middle of a quest, pretty cool, in Granblue you can switch characters too but only on checkpoints in story mode, not while farming monsters. Imagine having two mains and bringing both to the quest to switch in the middle of it.\n\n[Katalina at the prospect of getting switched in every battle just to tank a boss attack with light wall then getting switched out again for Yodarha, if they would ever add the two mains feature](https://preview.redd.it/fdlcvfvp7joe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e05262b416a38b3ba6c5516dac5a34986536745c)\n\nThe next point of comparison is the multiplayer. Monster Hunter Wilds multiplayer system with Public and private Lobbies, Guilds, Link Parties, Environment Link Parties and the current quest hunting group is so confusing. But you get through it after a while. In the end though, the multiplayer is really more like revolving doors.\n\nYou can play with your friends, you will all be in a party together and it automatically sends invites to them whenevery you start a quest. And you can activate or deactive auto-join of randoms too. But the most effective way of playing is everyone stays in their own world, monitors their own world map, and when a good monster with good reward appears you go hunt it and invite your friends. Then you slay it and immediately after everyone is teleported back at their own world again. Randoms come and randoms go, if you are a fan of multiplayer and activate it, but you never meet them again.\n\nAnd some randoms even join your game, use binoculars on the monster you are hunting to see if its bigger than the biggest monster they have hunted before, and if its too small for an achievement, they just bail again.\n\n[Playing Granblue Fantasy Relink with Friends in hard quests is a peak gaming experience \\(for people who have friends\\)](https://preview.redd.it/21kdcnbx8joe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d91cd86d9de0f29c6263ff8fafb1469f3b19a66)\n\nThe way bigger player base also makes Monster Hunter Wilds a lot more anonymous than Granblue even at peak times. You could always remember the player names and their mains with the costumes. Oh don't get me started how the ideal MH build currently, for any weapon that exists, uses the same set effects so everyone runs a combination of the same viable 5-10 armor pieces. At least we have transmogrify so it is visually different.\n\nPlaying through MH Wilds with friends felt like everyone playing single player, joining the others or not depending on if they need a specific drop too, and minding your own business until you are fully built. Once thats done, well, drop the game I guess?\n\nLastly, the story. Everyone said Granblue Fantasy Relink is a typical shounen story, nothing to write home about.\n\nBut you know what? Compared to Monster Hunter Wilds, the Granblue Story was EPIC. It had no plot but we had great music and hype moments.\n\n[Vyrn is ALWAYS there for you!](https://preview.redd.it/0xegbriy9joe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ab561470920f9b431d0d3c7bb3dbc9abe64402c)\n\n[Hype moment](https://preview.redd.it/fkdj37x3ajoe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a3f0f43cc5d1f70abf9a9a0a95e41e52c510dbb)\n\n[Great Music](https://preview.redd.it/06vs3yweajoe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad2db706af990b2096deabb8931ec98b617ab872)\n\n[And Armpits. Peak Anime](https://preview.redd.it/440x61cgajoe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8debcc0a0642eed3a45502aecea460d197dfbf15)\n\nI won't go into the story of MH Wilds because of spoilers but let's say it's just there to give us a reason to fight. The Monster fights are fire though no questions asked.\n\nSo, I am not mad at Monster Hunter or anything. It is a great game. But I don't feel like playing more. Everytime something in MH Wilds happens, I compare it to Granblue, and wish I was playing Granblue Fantasy Relink 2 instead. This game nearly made me to install GBFR again, but I saw on steam that I already have 300 hours on it and all achievements, and my character builds were pretty much perfect, so yeah, nothing to do there either, give us GBFR2 already please.\n\nThat's all there to say, give Monster Hunter Wilds a try if you liked GBFR.",

At baseline, it's the same as any other recent MH game: join lobby, post or accept quest. Maybe search for an SOS flare if you're feeling kind that day. That's it.  \n\nAll the additional layers simply offer you ways to fine tune your multiplayer experience. Squads allow you to easily find \"regulars\" or like minded players to play with. Link parties let you make a fixed party of people to share quests with quickly and effortlessly, even between different sessions. Environment Link is basically just posting an Expedition quest in the other games if you wanna faff about in an area.  \n\nNow, the game's not great at onboarding for these systems, which is why people might think it's more complicated than it actually is, but it's all optional, and interacting with the basic system exactly as before gets you the exact same results as before.  \n\nTrying to MP the story fucking sucks tho. But Relink story is solo only, so we're used to that anyways lol",

It felt like each character was a different weapon in monster hunter with all the fancy combos and techs.\n\nRelink was a great stopgap for me. It filled the monster hunter hole in my heart last year and I played it for 3 months straight. It felt like a cross between the combat system of final fantasy 7 remake and monster hunter with the anime feel of god eater",

Like when gbf was first shown it was very different from most any game at the time, but now lots of games have done similar things while it was in development. Still hope they decide to make relink 2 or even go balls to the walls and build out a mmo/live service that keeps getting updated over the long term, though they might have to re-evaluate several aspects if they want players to stick around long enough for that model to work.",

There are characters that get engraved in your mind if you like them enough, quotes to remember from them, not just battle groans and weapon switching, constantly running after monsters that run away. I still find relink addicting even after all these months and the many hours played",

They felt awfully tropey and most of the stuff you learn about them is through text with voice over. Also vyrn VA in english is the most annoying voice imaginable (even worst than the cat in mh stories).\n\n I could not get in the endgame loop because everything I could think about is that I could be grinding in mh instead. Knowing there will not be more content also put me off wanting to grind endgame. \n\nThe bosses were really cool thought. Very similar to FF16 in a good way. \n\nJust to clarify I don't think the story in mh is better only the gameplay loop.",
