Lots of grind.  \nJust yesterday, with about 120hours finally beat the final mission of the pre last update patch. Now aiming for the true final mission.\n\nI would suggest you join the discord, you can find a lot of great people there willing to help.",

The best part for me was when I discovered a google doc with AI Optimization builds; at which point I became obsessed with doing the whole game in auto and just fine tuning my party and their builds to let them trash the bosses without any input; I had an absolute blast (only really works after you finish the story though; so do that first, then enjoy an extra 40-50h to complete all trophies and playing with the AI :))",
