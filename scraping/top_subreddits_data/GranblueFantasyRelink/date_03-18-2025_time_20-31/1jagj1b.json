Then side-hustling other character builds for fun. 284 hours in and I can't get enough of this because I have been wanting a game like this for over a decade since playing Vindictus and wanting that satisfying character action hack-and-slash experience but largely single-player.\n\nI think I got another 300 hours in me including a replay of the main story honestly, I'm living my best life.",
