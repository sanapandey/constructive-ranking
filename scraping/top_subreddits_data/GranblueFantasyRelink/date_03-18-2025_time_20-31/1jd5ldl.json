    "selftext": "So I finally just finished the Proto-Bahamut fight and unlocked Behemoth and Lucilius, I don't dare to even try them considering Proto-Bahamut took me multiple tries. I am just wondering what sigils should I be trying to find/what quests I should be farming for said sigils? Is it just curio box farming at this point and forging sigils with tickets? Any advice would be helpful.",

            "body": "Farm what you can. Save up a bunch of transmarvels from crappy sigils you won\u2019t use. Then, save-scum your big transmarvels until you get the sigils you need for your main character. \n\nWhile doing that: Fully unlock your main characters Ascension weapon if you haven\u2019t. Once you can reliably beat bahamut, you will not neee to do this part for any other character. This is assuming you have fully maxed out your main characters Mastery Points, and their scenario episodes to unlock all sigil slots. \n\nThen, when you get their awakening sigil or the pieces that make it, and Warpath if you\u2019re lucky, then you can start looking at the in-depth sigils. \n\nPrimarily, your damage cap is top priority, however with a weaker weapon you might not do enough damage to even reach it, let alone increase the cap. Your sigil build of course entirely depends on your character. Some things are consistent for every character: Things like Stamina, Tyranny, Damage Cap are consistent across every build. Assuming you have poor sigils, here\u2019s a baseline you COULD go for: Stamina V, Tyranny V, Damage Cap V x4 (I can\u2019t remember how many damage caps you need to max it out, a fully upgraded ascension weapon should reduce this number by a little bit). Critical Hit V (to get as close to capped critical hit chance as you can get. Most characters with their critical hit chance weapon are a cheap and reliable substitute for ascension weapon for starting out) and then their awakening sigils. That\u2019s 9 sigils total, 7 if you have the actual awakening sigil (which combines their two character-specific sigils). \n\nThe next hurdle is War Elemental. This is necessary on every character unless the fight you\u2019re doing is weak to your characters element, and even then there are instances where you still want it. War elemental comes from appraising curios at Zathba, and you guessed it, can be save scummed. The higher level mission, the higher level the curio, which means easier to get War Elemental. \n\nYou can look up guide videos for your favorite character, mine was Seigfried. Darkhero 2 was my go to content creator for Granblue Relink, and his guides all should still be relevant since the game never got updated again. Note that some characters are worse at Bahamut, Behemoth, and Lucilius than others. So you may still struggle depending on your chosen Main, but all characters can clear the content. Every single one, some just a little easier (looking at you Sandalphon and charlotta )",

I think with AI I can do bahamut in like 7 minutes or less. When my friends would play together we had it faster than that. Often skipping every phase except for the last one if we were locked in. \n\nI have only cleared Lucilius with AI, and I think behemoth I\u2019ve done with one friend not all of them.

Generally you want Attack up, SBA Damage, Attack Damage Cap, and one of your choice, like skill damage up. It\u2019s a pain in the ass to get, so farm mastery points all the time! \nSlimepede mission > everything, and you might even find a group online to do it. Even if you don\u2019t, each slime gives like, 100+ points, so the more you kill the easier it gets. This mission is easily done with Eugan or Rackam. I prefer Eugan, throwing grenades and shooting them mid air to hit many slimes. \n\nThere\u2019s also a discord dedicated to the game that you can probably find people to help guide you in real time. Since I don\u2019t know what character you main, I can only give you general advice.",

            "body": "Most importantly, you need to make your AI party members useful. In general, you just need 4x damage cap V, 1x tyranny V, 1x stamina V, 2x nimble onslaught V and critical rate V, this in itself should be enough for you to farm Behemoth, and way more than enough for Bahamut. Guts is also very good to have, along with Autorevive. (May not be optimal for some characters, but it'll work.) Later on, get them War Elementals, and once you fully awaken their Terminus weapons and they have over 25k attack, use Berserker Echo too. Imo making your AI team at least OK is by far the most important thing for farming, and it's not difficult at all. Get Eugen on your AI team. If you have Less is More sigils, put Zeta on your team too and remove all of her skills. For overmasteries, you generally want Crit rate and damage cap (normal and/or skill, depending on the character). Basically, you generally can't go wrong with crit, skill cap, normal cap and attack bonus (not optimal for everyone but mostly OK). Crit is generally the only one you really, really need, the higher, the better.\n\nFor Bahamut and Terminus weapons, you can just learn the fight, it's not difficult at all, especially with a useful AI team. At first, just set SBA use to manual and leave an SBA for the final attack of the boss, but you won't even need this after you get a bit more powerful.\n\nFor normal sigils, you can make use of the sigil fusion feature if you don't mind reloading. Fusing sigils can occasionally (and not even that rarely) get you level a 15 sigil from 2 level 11 ones. Fusing the same two sigils twice will always result in the same sigil iirc, and I don't know how this is affected by doing a mission between the two attempts. You can only fuse V+ sigils, sadly, and not even every + sigil (not War Elemental or Berserk Echo, but you can fuse Supplementary Damage V+).\n\nFor curios, before you can comfortably farm Behemoth, you can farm Nazarbonju on Maniac, hopefully you can kill it before its first overload, which will result in 15-20s kill times. These will be worse than Behemoth curios, but way easier and faster to get, and you can get War Elementals from these.\n\nFor character sigils, just transmute enough sigils to get 30 transmarvels at first, and save scum. You need to clear a mission between attempts, you can combine this with curio farming if you want. Just check if you really want the Warpath and which of the Awakening sigils are good, this is different for each character (eg. Narmaya's warpath is good, but you need to be able to make up for the SBA gain nerf; and Eugen doesn't use sniper mode with AI so you don't need that one). It's always very good if you can get a useful character sigil with Damage Cap eg. Just be a bit patient, you can get good ones pretty fast. Also look out for good Wrightstones (level 20, critical rate and two other useful rolls generally), those are somewhat rare.  If you're lucky, you can get ones with Supplemental Damage. Do not bother crafting character sigils imo, savescumming transmarvels will get you much better ones. Also, since you always get the same sigils, you don't need to use up all your transmarvels if you find a good one. Just reload and use just enough to get the sigils you want. Also: sigils may not always be worth it, but good wrightstones are. Apart from Supplementary damage, Berserk Echo, War Elemental and a few other difficult to get sigils (Flight over Fight, Untouchable etc), or stuff you don't have enough of, just turn everything that's not a V+ into knicknack vouchers and then transmarvels. Same with low level wrightstones.\n\nOne last thing, there's a sigil called Flight over Fight, which decreases your attack power by 50% but makes all of your dodges perfect dodges. Combined with 2x Nimble Onslaught, Improved Dodge and a few extra damage sigils to make up for the attack decrease, it'll make every fight much, much easier (although Berserker Echo will not be usable with it, or at least I don't know if you can get to 25k attack while using it). I use it on Narmaya and it makes the Behemoth fight actually fun. I'm a bit crap at the game though, if you don't need it, it's even better.",

I'll just say it again: imo the thing that helps farming the most, by far, is gearing up your AI team. Nothing else is comparable: if you know the game and are good at it, you can do everything anyway, but if you're not, or just average, they can still carry you through most fights, even in proud, which can also help you learn these fights. \n\nAlso, one more thing: the easiest quests for stuff are imo Slimepede for levels and Mastery points, the last Extreme quest (so these are the rumoured monsters or something) for large Fortitude Crystals, and Blazing Trials for Damage Cap V+ (or proto bahamut if you can). You can use sigil fusion to level up sigils, you may need to reload a lot, but it can be still pretty fast with a bit of luck. When I tried Tweyen, I managed to outfit her in fully leveled V+ sigils in less than an hour (but then I had loads of half-worthless sigils to play with). You can just try to merge random half-crap v+ sigils that have only one trait you need and hope for the best :-D and then reload.",
