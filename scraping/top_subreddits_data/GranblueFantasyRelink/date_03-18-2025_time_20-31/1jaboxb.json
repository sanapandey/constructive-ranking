It's better to just cancel out his first attacks of his combos as they have low damage cap.\n\n2. You can cancel any attack animation with lunge and continue the string to continue the combo by timing it. Making it easy to stick to the enemy.\n\n3. Consider putting \"Untouchable\" in your build if you have space. Sieg is generous on Sigil slots as its easy to reach damage cap.",
