    "selftext": "So I recently beaten the game, pretty good game with an excellent combat but I have a question and it\u2019s if I need to play online to get all the crewmate cards. I know Siero changes one card for seven golden badges, but as far as I know those badges can only be acquired by playing online. That\u2019s just shitty for me since I play in PS5 so I would need to buy a full month subscription just to get a character. So I ask, is that crewmate cards really needed to get all characters?",

Ignore that. Start the quest in closed.\nWin and it will still give you your gold medals.\n\nYou cannot repeat quest like this you must do these steps each time. Good luck",
