Outside of maybe a spoiler fight or two, are there any actual new enemy bosses post-game?\n\nIt's definitely a 50+ hour game to max out just one character, though I imagine each subsequent character takes way less, but if people are wondering, I don't think it's like Monster Hunter in that you have that big of a variety of bosses to choose from as the game keeps going. I hope they add more later and they probably will, it's just not there yet, afaik.",

Can polish it with SkyBound Art at the end.\n\nOr ignore lizard form spam and just skip it as fast as you can with either Y or X string.\n\nOfc you have normal X attacks you can use to start combo with, start with Y> Y. Or Jumping X> X> X> X> Y.\n\nDon't forget there is charged Y > Y starter/ filler, but I never really use it tbh.\n\nAlso don't forget you can safely dodge before finisher during combos and then still use Y finisher.\n\n\nPurple gauge is dragon form. Blue gauge is Godmight, you transform when at 4 segments but you can cancel transformation with dodges and keep form indefinitely if you want, as long as you keep attacking.\n\nGodmight also gets automatically spent at Y finisher. You can juggle it with Y attacks and skills, but if you commit too deep and circle empties you must use Y finisher, otherwise gauge will be wasted if you try to cancel it with a skill.",

Hitting combo ender attacks (or Link Attacks again) while in Dragonform adds 1/4 of the Blue side gauge. Once that is 4/4 filled, you automatically end Dragonform early and move on to Godmight.\n\n-Godmight is just his normal form, but with buffed up stats (I think) and his Heavy attacks have an extra input after the huge slam which starts a very long flurry that automatically ends Godmight after it concludes.\n\n-If you don't do the extra Heavy string, Godmight just sticks around until the gauge empties (it is a timer again.) If you don't end Godmight early, Id has an altered Skybound Art while in Godmight which I imagine does extra damage.",

But grinding EXP/ getting a character to Level 100 takes very little effort once you get to manic Difficulty and can farm this one mission. So if that is all you are concerned about then unlock away.\n\nDo note however that there has been talk about not unlocking characters to increase the chance at getting ultimate weapons from the last boss. i tried looking for the post but dont see it.\n\nIn simple terms there is a big boss you fight as the last mission of the game. Its the hardest fight and it has a chance at dropping the best weapon for a character. But it seems that the weapon it drops is randomized based on what characters you have unlocked.\nNot 100% confirmed from the last time i checked.\n\nAnyway, so if you are after your favorites weapon but have everyone unlocked then the chances of getting any one weapon get lower and lower. Just something to consider.\n\nEDIT: Found it\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GranblueFantasyRelink/comments/1al5t54/psa_do_not_unlock_characters_you_dont_plan_on/",

You'll unlock the Slimepede mission in maniac that helps you farm EXP and mastery points very quickly too.

ProtoB was the original endgame, you should be running mostly-good V+ sigils, and they should be leveled.\n\nRosetta and Io are notoriously bad when played by AI. Rackam is okay-ish but not the best because he tends to squander some of his skills.\n\nThe best way to play Io is by animation canceling out of the aftercast from her charge attack. The AI will not do this. The AI is generally bad at correctly playing charge-based characters, and on Io it's even worse because the canceling is the only way to get great performance out of her.\n\nBeyond that, you'd have to post your build(s) for us to comb through. Guts/Autorevive are great on AI if you find them dying during the fight (they don't on some fights, and on others they eat damage like crazy) and potion hoarder isn't worth the slot on AI.",

Can I play the game offline, or does it require me to always be online?\n2. Does the game share the same story as the browser? a retell, so to speak? Or is it an extension? Is it the side story of the original? Or a completely original story with some connection here and there with the original?\n3. Will I be fine going in without almost any knowledge whatsoever about the world or story?\n4. How's the gameplay? Something like the FF7 remake? or DMC? or Monster Hunter? or Samurai Warriors?\n5. I think I read somewhere mention something about coop. Is it obligatory? Will I suffer playing solo?\n6. Does the game have microtransactions? Can you get everything the game offers you? or do you need to spend a few bucks for it?",

It tells a new story that takes place after the crew set foot out of the first skydom.\n \n3) yeah, the game does a good job telling you what happened on the \"previous game\" anyway. Plus, there is a toogle glossary on every dialogue.\n \n4) Like MH, but with a bare minimum personality.\n \n5) Not obligatory (just like the og game was also not obligatory). Just very fun to do it with other players. I know no one, but always play with discord random players. There's a channel there, you should try.\n \n6)Nop. It's not a gacha. There will be paid content released, but it's in the form of DLC. You buy it, you get the full content. Just like right now you get all 19 characters, but have to unlock them via invitational letters. In march they will release Lucilius boss, in april they will release Seofon and Tweyen as new characters(they will be for free) but together with free content will also be paid content.",

For certain characters, esp ones with full builds and ones that have no trouble hitting damage cap, you can use several of the new sigils with very little downside, and a noticeable 10% or so damage increase with 1-2 sigils. The first sigil of Alpha, Omega, and sometimes Beta are very efficient.

Now that we've had time to farm Lucilius, plenty of people have Gamma sigils too, which grants a 50k shield after SBA.  Without a Gamma shield you'll still die in one hit to most things, but the defensive layers offered by some combo of potion hoarder + guts + autorevive (+ Flight Over Fight and other dodge sigils, specifically Nimble Onslaught) means you're covered when you do get clipped.",

To give an idea, Lancelot can kill the boss in an ingame timer (which freezes when you SBA) of about 1min, while a \"normal\" meta dps team might take a timer of 3-5min. Real time, Lancelot teams can kill in about 3-5min of real time while normal play takes close to 10min.\n\n\n\nFor actual meta DPS, Io and Eugen prevail because of their ranged playstyle and consistent dps (not to mention very hard hitting nukes).\n\nNarmaya with good play is also very high damage, with good luck probably the highest raw damage in the game.

For example, her Arvess Hammer actually has insane tracking and can track/lunge *really far.* So if you're mid combo or close to getting the 3rd loop, and the monster is running or repositioning, you can wait on triggering the hammer (you can even dodge once mid air to not touch the ground, without losing the combo), and *then* hammer to lunge directly at them and cover like half the map or more super fast.\n\nAll the while pitying the ground-based plebs running towards the boss at a snails pace compared to Zeta.\n\nOr on bosses that spawn a lot of minions like >!Pyet-A!< or >!Proto-Bahamut!<, you can just keep looping in the air picking them off one by one, while staying out of range of the bosses' sad attempts to distract you because a lot of their attacks don't reach high enough.",

However, some traits are straight up **bad** (flat attack, flat HP, Rupie Tycoon, Path of Mastery, most resistances, Improved Healing) or too situational (Overdrive/Break Assassin, Firm Stance, Lucky Charge) to usually desire.  You should also consider your character's unique sigils- Swordmaster's Art is too good to never not take, but Swordmaster's Prowess is also really good.  Roll transmarvel enough and you're eventually guaranteed a sigil with both of their effects in one\n\nYou want to assemble all of the \"mandatory\" sigils and as many of your helpful traits as you can into your sigil setup.  Most of your *really good* sigils will come from Transmarvel or curios, but you can target farm certain types of double sigils depending on the mission (shown in the \"drop items\" tab on the mission page)",

That way *if* you do any changes to your build, like dropping a duplicate Luci sigil, you keep the lone 15 equipped to get the most out of the single slot.\n\nLike, say you're only going to grind up 2 of each Luci Sigil. It's better to have 15 Alpha, 13 Alpha, 15 Beta, 13 Beta, 15 Gamma, and 13 Gamma than it is to have them all at 14. That way you can run Alpha Beta Gamma Gamma and still get the most value out of the single Alpha and Beta. Or if you want to do something like Alpha Gamma Gamma or even Alpha Gamma to leave room for some regular Damage Cap V+ for utility slots, you're aren't shorting the lone sigils.",

Dunno what the discrepancy is between us, but it looks like I need Stamina, Concentrated Fire, *and* Life on the Line to cap all of my rotation.\n\n[Test build](https://i.imgur.com/I9aPNZW.jpeg) and [my overmastery.](https://i.imgur.com/c3TURTl.jpeg) I took off Supp damage to make it easier to see the remaining numbers, and threw in a second CHR sigil to push me to 100% chance to eliminate some variation.\n\nStamina, Concentrated Fire, Life on the Line, Warpath active:\n\n    4-Round Burst:    45451 c\n    BEB V:           330614 (x2) c\n    Spitfire:        371492 (x2) c\n    Bullet Hail:      82646 (/hit) c\n    Coffinmaker:      49584 (/hit) c\n\nStamina, Concentrated Fire, Warpath active:\n\n                       high        low\n    4-Round Burst:    38901      35526\n    BEB V:           330614     297631\n    Spitfire:        371492     295434\n    Bullet Hail:      82646 (/hit) c\n    Coffinmaker:      49584 (/hit) c\n\nRemoving Life on the Line, but keeping Stamina and Conc Fire, made it so that the second hit of BEB V would not cap, the second hit of Spitfire would not cap, and 4-round burst wouldn't cap at all with any shot.\n\nI didn't run a third test removing Concentrated Fire since I already saw a damage drop by removing one of my three damage sigils, so I can only presume it'll drop further if I reduce everything to a single stamina. Plus I only had an hour to do this. Later tonight, if I have time, I'll replace my Gamma sigils with Damage Cap V and see if that lowers the caps enough that I start hitting them with 2 (or 1) damage sigil.\n\n###Edit:\n\nGot a chance to test further. Build is same as above except I removed Warpath, and I replaced the 2x Gamma Sigils with Damage Cap V+ Guts.\n\nStamina, Concentrated Fire, Life on the Line:\n\n    4-Round Burst:    35896 c\n    BEB V:           261112 (x2) c\n    Spitfire:        293752 (x2) c\n    Bullet Hail:      65272 (/hit) c\n    Coffinmaker:      39160 (/hit) c\n\n---\n\nStamina, Concentrated Fire:\n\n                       high        low\n    4-Round Burst:    32400      29606\n    BEB V:           261112     246202\n    Spitfire:        293752     243153\n    Bullet Hail:      65272 (/hit) c\n    Coffinmaker:      39160 (/hit) c\n\n4-Round Burst not capping at all. First hit of BEB V and Spitfire are capped. Second hit sometimes capping, but not every time. Note that this is without Helmsman's Tenacity, which would further raise the cap (but not damage dealt) by BEB.\n\n---\n\nStamina:\n\n                       high        low\n    4-Round Burst:    24019      21841\n    BEB V:           261112     180205\n    Spitfire:        293752     175375\n    Bullet Hail:      65272 (/hit) c\n    Coffinmaker:      39160 (/hit) c\n\nSame story as above, but worse. 4-Round Burst is now grossly under cap, doing only a fraction of its potential. BEB V and Spitfire still cap their first hits, but their second hits are severely weakened. Sure, Coffinmaker and Bullet Hail still cap with just a stamina, but building that way is crippling Rackam's normal damage potential.\n\n---\n\n**Also worth noting is that my testing seems to have revealed a major display bug. With the recent update, the damage cap indicator was updated to have a more-distinct visual to make it easier to tell when you were capped, with a [diagonal slash](https://images.microcms-assets.io/assets/18529505c5224bc79903ba9210ef043d/6a04e62434b248fda047616bf0364c68/v1.2.1_001.jpg?w=400&h=225) being added to the preexisting horizontal slash. It turns out all my numbers are showing that indicator, even on hits that I *know* aren't capped because they have damage variation.**",

AI builds typically lean into specific skills (or lack thereof) with abnormally high natural damage caps and then stuffing a preposterous amount of damage into the character at the cost of almost everything else. They also rely on the fact that, in most fights, the AI are absolute masters at perfect dodging, which is what makes Nimble Onslaught 30 so valuable.\n\nThe AI builds are going to lack a lot of the utility and/or survival that a player character is going to need to be effective *unless* that player is nearly perfect at avoiding damage. Things like Improved Dodge (or Guard) and Potion Hoarder are practically required on a played character and useless to the AI. 1 Nimble Onslaught is good for a player, 2 is somewhat overkill. Glass Cannon is a very risky add because the punishment for mistakes gets way higher.",

To fully awaken the last weapon you need to level all your weapons to max for a character (but you don't have to invest into them beyond that e.g. awaken the Ascension weapon, which many see as a waste of resources) so that is always worth pumping resources into when you have them for your main(s). \n\nRegarding levelling those V+ sigils, it is extremely inefficient and requires a ton of resources; I never did that but always just got enough Azurites, which is a resource that maxes them out instantly. It's quite rare, the earliest you can do it is Slimepede (first quest of Maniac difficulty) WHEN you encounter the very rare rainbow slime (when you do, it can drop 5 of those). In the early post-game that's how I got my upgrades (and this quest is good for EXP as well). Later on, there quests in Proud difficulty, which can drop more Azurites.",

Never had any issues with any other games whatsoever. \n\nEvery time I tried to launch it, a game window would pull up for a few seconds like it was trying to load, and then it would just close out completely and Steam would go back to being able to launch the game like it wasn\u2019t running. Nothing in task manager.\n\nI tried all the usual fixes, disabling full screen optimizations, running in compatibility mode, running as administrator, closing MSI afterburner, updating GPU drivers, tried launching the game with several different launch options to try and force different DX levels, tried disconnecting my controller first, tried rebooting and starting the game before connecting my controller at all, tried re-enabling GPU scheduling, tried changing Nvidia power options, tried rebooting several different times of course, allllllll the same result.\n\nAfter that I got so pissed off a developer would ship a game that just\u2026.didn\u2019t start on a regular run of the mill system that I refunded the game. I want to buy it again and give it another shot, but I\u2019m only going to do that if I come across someone that had the same issue and 100% has the fix for it.\n\nLet me know if anyone\u2019s has this happen before, thanks you.",

Her bread and butter is really simple and basically just charging light attacks until you are full vortex orbs, then charging a full 4/4 stargaze (pink meter) heavy attack and releasing it. This is massive dmg. \n\nUsing Steady Focus sigil when you get it makes you uninterruptible, but until then, you just have to get good at dodging. If you keep the heavy attack button held down, you can actually dodge and keep charging without losing the meter, it's a game changer if you didn't know. Low Profile sigil helps the boss ignore targeting you, which is amazing, and the Charged Attack sigil will speed up and increase the dmg of it. \n\nLater on at endgame you unlock Starfall or something, a long cooldown, much higher dmg skill. You will still be spamming stargazer when it's down though.",

I know you have to collect meterials and such in order to upgrade your characters but I wonder how grindy it is.\n3. One of the main things that I saw was pushed from the game were the boss fights, are they repititive or does the game currently has a good veriaty on the bosses.\n4.

It depends on how many characters you want to build, how 'optimal' you want to get it, how high on the difficulty chart you want to go, etc.\n\n3) I'm not at the end so I can't say, but there are some fairly good bosses overall. Even what you might consider a palette swap (ice skeleton vs dark skeleton) have different mechanics. The in game enemy list has 70 entries (including trash monsters)\n\n4) They are fairly confident, with some cheats. They tend to 'auto-perfect-dodge' big aoes they cant be trusted to dodge normally, and they tend to use their abilities well, but not perfectly.

Is there anything that can be done to accelerate this?\n* Can you set tactics for AI character members to follow before battle? Can you change these on the fly in battle?

Throw on a Steady Focus sigil (any level will do) and you're basically sigil capped.\n\nRemember to grab her legendary sigils from Sierro's Shop ASAP. One you can craft, and the other you buy with gold tickets.

They're like Smash Bros Melee when you could get \"bonuses\" in the match like elbow room, pushing opponents a lot or edge hog, prevent an enemy from grabbing an edge by grabbing it first.

It's possible to only achieve one of the three listed objectives and still get S++ based on your score from other areas.\n\nAs for the specific quest you're referring to, the number of enemies you have to kill is actually unlimited. The faster you clear enemies the more waves of enemies spawn. Instead of having to clear the mission in as fast a time as possible, you get extra score based on how many waves of enemies you kill.

From what I've seen, the enemies seem not strong and smart enough to punish you, and the stakes are rather low. How is it compared to MH?\n4. How replayable is it? Any endgame grinds or challenges I can do?\n5. Are the maps huge? It looks like a quest game (like MH) and I think MH maps are nice to explore, walk around, and take screenshots. Any explore mode?

I am getting 2-shot by about everything, and 1-shot by most things. I feel like wet paper and I have no idea how my defense dropped.

A mixed build, with her revive, Phantasmagoria, Alexandria and Disruption. Focusing on critting 100% of the time and charge attacks. She's my favorite character in Relink from the GBF universe.\n\nI really love the other 4 as well. But I cant imagine playing melee on some of these bosses. They're absurdly mobile with very little downtime and I only assume that gets worse. However, I'm willing to put in the practice. Especially if they get better as the game increases in difficulty.\n\nThis strikes me as a game where you can do well with anyone (except Ghandagoza). So ultimately, maybe its up to me to choose. Can my DPS keep up if I keep playing Cag? I read somewhere that Phantasmagoria ends up useless because of damage cap (thanks mobile game).

Her gameplay is a bit on the plain/boring side, leaning more into her skills, but not much more so than Cags. Cags is also a good option for pushing DPS even into Proud- you're not going to run into people casually capping everything until the end stages and you will constantly run into people who keep getting downed due to not bringing enough survivability regardless, so free heals and Rhizomata's AOE raise still have value (particularly in duo dragon battles onwards). Your personal DPS might be low, but your contributions to partywide DPS will be considerable. Of the others, Charlotta is simplest to play (if a bit spammy) and has some party utility, followed by Narmaya who is somewhat complex and a pure DPS, to Katalina who is a flexible character like Djeeta but who has a very tight balance to walk between accessing her DPS state (Ares) and keeping it up (requires skills) and using her teamwide utility (she can only use teamwide skills while Ares is out).",

Each char has the same-ish 6weapons with generic different stats that you upgrade similar to a mix of armor(use stones to upgrade the level raw stats) and weapons(use monster materials to unlock the level cap of the weapon). There is however like 18-19 characters so there's some variety.\n\nGranblue story is kinda irrelevant and it's summarized a bit ingame if you want to look into it, the game's story takes place after the original event but is somewhat standalone stuff.",

Which I beat first try, but..........man it was a pain. \n\nObviously I haven't gotten used to the character yet, but I really wish she had super armor or something when doing the cleave. Cause a slight breeze knocks her out of it. \n\nDid I just so happen to pick the most skill dependent character? Lol anyone got any tips for best girl? \n\nEither way, I will persevere, cause Narmaya is a fucking BADDIE and my favorite character in the Grandblue IP.",

She's good and once you get it, it's not that bad, but learning fights on her means you're gonna mess up a bunch.\n\nMain tip is to remember skills will put you back into the normal rotation right away, so if you drop your rotation use a skill to get back in there. Like in pink stance you'll be able to do a quick charge right away after a skill and in blue stance you'll start in the middle of the combo(so the good part) right away. Dodge will also not reset these states so you can dodge and resume.",

I have some thoughts already but would love to see what people say without me influencing anything.\n\n* I am typically a meta whore, I love knowing who are the top DPS classes in a game, then picking my stylistic favorite out of those. I'm also open to playing meta classes that aren't strictly DPS, if they are just indispensibly amazing to have in parties but still fun to play. With that being said, I tend to tank if not playing DPS and almost never heal.\n\n* Stylistically, I'm a really big fan of characters and classes that have a satisfying burst phase or combo finisher. A good example is the TERA Warrior which builds up 10 stacks by attacking, then unleashes them in a big finisher, similar to Lost Ark's Surge Deathblade as well, or like FFXIV's Samurai. Burst phases are cool too, again similar to a lot of TERA's classes with a devastating 15 second buff, or like Igniter Sorceress in Lost Ark. \n\n* I don't prefer the big lumbering classes, and instead tend to like agile, fast-paced, flashy attackers, and/or flashy casters.\n\nThoughts?",

Since going from LV0 - LV15 Tyranny/Stamina is a bigger boost than going from LV15 - LV30 Tyranny/Stamina, the single Supp Damage sigil might add more damage than one of em if you're already getting levels in Tyranny or Stamina from a different V+ sigil.\n\nI would say a single Supp Damage is almost always better than Crit Damage V+, with the only exception being if I'm not hitting damage cap AND the Crit Damage V+ comes with a useful 2nd line (whether it's survivability lines like Potion Hoarder/Guts/Autorevive/Improved Dodge or Quick Cooldown/Cascade for more DPS).",

The center, which you fall down to if you drop below the buoyancy zone in the sky, is called the 'crimson horizon' where the otherworlders dwell.\n\nThe people that fled to the moon are also still there with advanced tech (pyet-a is moon tech for example, or their greatest creation and maybe future boss [Diaspora](https://gbf.wiki/Diaspora_(NPC))). There also exists moon dweller descendents in the sky realm such as [Grace](https://gbf.wiki/Grace_(NPC)) who was Yodarha's disciple in his fate episode. A whole [anniversary event](https://youtu.be/TRuRkO5y95M?si=2Fe1xWlpH7ciq3mP) was based around going to the moon and it's inhabitants. \n\nWell getting a bit side-tracked from the lack of ground so I better stop haha :)",

A long time ago some weird af invaders came from an outer plane, they called themselves Astrals and refer to the common folk as \"sky dwellers\". They tried to conquer everything using the equivalent to summons on Final fantasy, but here they are called Primals. There was a huge war, but eventually the locals won and Astrals pretty much disappeared. Their summons (the Primals) were left to their own luck so after centuries they started being worshiped as deities.\n \nThe whole stories starts because you (the captain) dies and gets saved by Lyria (the girl in blue) since she couldn't ressurect you, she did the closest thing to that which was linking the lives. If she dies, you die.\n \nLyria has a really unique skill so she can absord Primals to summon them later on, which many people tried to weaponize in the past. That is the general feel of the original game, although right now it has about 150 chapters of story so I'm not gonna spill everything.\n \nBasically, you CAN travel from a region of the sky to another. The first game happened mostly on a skydom called Phantagrande. But the sky was shattered (probably in result to the great war of times past) and now there is a huge ass dark-hole-ish storm right on the middle of it, so travelling from one region to another isn't the easiest thing in the world... the crew can because on the previous game they collected Keys called sky maps.\n \nThat's why the very first scene is the ship coming out from a dark storm. You just crossed the dark hole-ish middle of the map and now you're entering an entirely new region, the Zegagrande where this game will happen.",
