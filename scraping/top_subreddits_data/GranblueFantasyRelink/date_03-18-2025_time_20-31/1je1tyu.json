    "selftext": "I\u2019m currently stuck on Into The Abyss (Proud quest vs. Black Dragon). My main is Zeta with the setup above, and the rest of my AI team is kinda decent geared but obviously not as strong.\n\nAnd I just got Sandalphon\u2019s Warpath+ (2nd trait: Autorevive) from Transmarvel, it\u2019s probably my best drop after 50+ hours playing. I\u2019ve also heard he\u2019s really good, so can he carry me through this quest and into the late game? If he\u2019s that strong with Warpath+, I can buy him for $5 now. Thinking of swapping out Siegfried and keeping Zeta as an AI teammate",

            "body": "It's a good AI team you have here, not sure sandalphon will improve it. However one thing that stands out to me is Zetas set up. Generally, she's hard to cap and you have barely any attack sigils to hit the caps. Now, I've not put it in the calculator but adding stamina and one other attack sigil could help you with caps, particularly on Hammer as that one is notoriously hard to hit caps on. This could give you an immediate power boost, if I'm correct.\n\nEdit: I just noticed you do have stamina there, farming Cap Vs is top priority now.\n\nEdit 2: on a fully developed Zeta I also have Crit Hit DMG and Combo Booster, I think adding either of those somewhere will help you with DMG, preferrably make space by replacing those Cap IVs with Vs, which you can farm at the red dragon relatively easily.",

You don't have the final weapon which raises the cap by 100% so you may actually be fine rn. On top of Cap V, I would perhaps try and farm the Ascension weapon at least as it makes things smoother (even though it is more grinding and people generally recommend avoiding doing that, which I disagree with for your main, when you do it first time). It just helps in the long run, then you can work on final weapons for your main and the whole AI gang while picking up good V sigils as you go.",

Sandalphon is free after all if you get to the last quest of the game.\n\n\nYour sigils are barely upgraded and your weapons are not so good either. You could use Awakening weapons which unlock more skills at level 150. I'm not sure if you have the Tale of Bahamuts rage yet to unlock terminus weapons.\u00a0\n\n\nMostly your issues are unupgraded sigils. I don't understand why you build so much HP. You should try out the nimble onslaught seals and perfect dodge a lot. The difficulty curve really spikes here but you can do it with slowly getting better and biting through it. Even as Sandy you would have to perfect dodge a lot.\u00a0",

You only run HP if you have a weapon effect that requires you to have a certain amount of max HP to trigger.\n\n\nYou're better off dodging, healing, generating more energy so you can spam more ults (free dodge), and doing more damage so battles are over before you die.\u00a0\n\n\nYou should always go full out on the damage cap (use training room to see how many tyranny or other sigils you need until the damage value doesn't change anymore). Once your damage is capped, put the rest into utility and survival ones like the ones that give you extra dodges.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd yes you'll need the ascension weapon. Once maxed you can awaken it. Once awakened it will give all your sigils a free +1 level. You go from stinger to ascension to terminus. Maybe you can skip ascension with some characters and go straight to terminus, but since you're struggling here already I'd really take the easy way out and grind an awakening if I was you.\u00a0\n\n\nEspecially with you saying can't raise your sigils any higher. It would be worth awakening an ascension weapon then.\u00a0",

            "body": "Yes, Sandalphon can carry. The bigger problem is you don't have good sigil set ups.\n\nYou only have 10k attack or less when at end game you will have at least 25k attack. You are adding supplementary damage before capping your damage, capping damage is more important. You don't have 100% hit rate, I think critical hit rate 100% gives 100% more damage if you have all mastery nodes. Attack stat gives most power on the backend, it can be useful for Sandalphon who has 25 attack from weapon but generally attack stat isn't worth the 3 slot investment to max it.\n\nI would recommend:\n* Get your main and AI as close to damage cap and capping that damage as you can\n* Get stamina and tyranny on your main and AI. Adding a 3rd orange sigil like life on the line, glass cannon, combo booster, etc. would be good.\n* Get as close as you can to 100% critical hit rate \n* Replace the attack sigils, they aren't doing much \n* Replace the supplementary damage sigils, they won't do much until you reach cap\n* I just saw the berserker echo on Siegfried, replace that too until you get closer to 25k attack. It's not worth using yet but it's a very useful sigil once you get 25k attack.\n* I like to use aegis or greater aegis (only 1 on my main) and stay under 45k hp for terminus catastrophe effect. On AI, aegis and greater aegis aren't very useful because they dodge most attacks. So you can replace aegis and greater aegis as you want.\n\nIn general, you can check out the AI guide and you can try to copy what you are able to:\n* https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1pdbkqmrsrbF09-brAm1YVxytxQLTVN1volCW9DKJf-0/mobilebasic",

If you can keep high uptime of 100% crit rate, then you don't need to use a crit sigil.\n\nCagliostro's phantasmagoria also gives a party wide boost to crit rate if you have her in the party but it looks to be about 50% uptime to me without stacking quick cooldown and cascade.\n\nYou can get 100% crit rate by having 20% over mastery, 10 critical hit rate wrightstone, level 15 critical hit rate sigil and 1 point bonus from terminus or ascension sigil booster. I think the DLC characters like Sandalphon only need 16% over mastery, they have higher base crit. So for some effort and just 1 sigil slot, I prefer to use use 100% crit rate. I've seen some people that really thought about their build use 90% crit rate with most characters or even a Zeta with 50% crit rate effectively. So it's up to you on how much 100% crit rate uptime you build for, just know you are missing out on damage when 100% crit rate isn't reached.",
