Sandalphon is generally the best though. You unlock him at the end of the game.\u00a0",

Especially since there's a lot more \"positive\" people around to balance it lol.\n\nI'd like to say that even if Percieval was \"bad\" when comparing to other characters, I enjoyed the heck out of the time I spent with him. Particularly the a big part of Percieval's skill ceiling is the Supp damage he gains in his charged parry. His charged parry is also easier to pull off so it made me very satisfied(I think? Hardest was Narmaya).",
