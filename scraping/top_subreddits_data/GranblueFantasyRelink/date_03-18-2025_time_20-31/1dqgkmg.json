Since \"worth\" is highly subjective I won't directly say yes or no, but I think it's a super fun game and it can definitely keep you busy for a long time if you want to get really deep into it.\n\nThere are 22 different characters with relatively unique playstyles, a lot of bosses, and the last content update added several very challenging quests for you to work towards trying to complete (although this update we just got is making several of them easier so they'll be less of a struggle than before). \n\nPublic co-op matchmaking will be harder to do as more people \"complete\" the game and stop playing, but every quest is beatable in solo with AI teammates so it won't completely ruin the game.",

However, i think they did not need to nerf the Health and ATK for the boss, it was a fair challenge, They still have the goal timer, but with the nerf\u00b4s, to the bosses getting a S++ it\u00b4s super easy",
