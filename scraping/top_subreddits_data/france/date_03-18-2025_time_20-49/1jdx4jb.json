Know that is not the position of all of us, or even most of us. I even live in one of the most backward parts of the country, northeast Tennessee, and I\u2019m appalled. My sentiments are shared by some who live here and many more who live in much more progressive parts of the country. Those who agree with the current administration (and I mean this in the most serious and sincere way possible) are crazy and brainwashed. People I have lived with my whole life and seemed the very best of friends have become the most hate filled and vicious people that I thought could only exist in movies or the last century. I have even halted all contact with my parents, who despite hating each other, have both fallen into the Trump cult.\n\nMy grandfather fought in WWII and spent a lot of time during the war in England and after in France.  If someone made a joke at the expense of the French he would go off and made sure I always understood the truth. I think that\u2019s why these comments by the supposed representatives of my country have shaken me so. I know that the French were our first friends as a nation, and that we may not have gained our Independence from England without their help. Hell,more than half the ideas that spurned on the enlightenment were birthed in France. \n\nI dunno, maybe this is more a rant than anything. I just wanted to express a feeling of brotherhood that has unfortunately been tarnished by the most unamerican president possibly ever. Hopefully we can all weather this spray tanned storm and be better off for it. But until we are free of it, vive la France.",

                    "body": "> Do you feel/see that some MAGA people are starting to turn on Trump ?\n\nTu as pos\u00e9 toutes les bonnes questions. Il faut que OP trouve les bons alli\u00e9s et mettre en exergue l'endroit o\u00f9 Trump fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 le plus mal \u00e0 ses soutiens: au niveau de leur fiert\u00e9 nationale et de leur portefeuille. Quelques exemples:\n\n1. Trump est impr\u00e9visible, et le march\u00e9 boursier d\u00e9teste l'incertitude. \n2. La nature  Keyn\u00e9sienne du \"Bideneconomics\" stimulait la demande et \u00e9tait approuv\u00e9 par les contracteurs du gouvernement, puis a irrigu\u00e9 toute l'\u00e9conomie US et aussi internationale.\n3. La main d\u2019\u0153uvre \u00e9trang\u00e8re est n\u00e9cessaire pour bon nombre d'entreprises.\n4. L'avanc\u00e9e technologique des USA d\u00e9pend de la recherche.  \n5. *Make America Great Again* passe aussi par le \"soft power\" qui inclut Voice of America et sa pr\u00e9sence dans les instances internationales.\n6. La puissance du pays d\u00e9pend de la pr\u00e9sence des chercheurs \u00e9trangers. Or maintenant on assiste \u00e0 une fuite de cerveaux. La baisse des \u00c9tats-Unis renforce la mont\u00e9e de la Chine. \n7. Les exportations invisibles dont le tourism sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 affect\u00e9es par l'impopularit\u00e9 du pays au niveau international.\n\n------\n\n> Do you feel/see that some MAGA people are starting to turn on Trump?\n\nYou asked all the right questions. OP needs to find the right allies and highlight where Trump is already hurting his supporters the most: their national pride and their wallets. A few examples:\n\n1. Trump is unpredictable, and the stock market hates uncertainty.\n2. The Keynesian nature of \"Biden economics\" stimulated demand and was approved by government contractors, then irrigated the entire US and international economy.\n3. Foreign labor is necessary for many companies.\n4. US technological progress depends on research.\n5. *Make America Great Again* also involves \"soft power,\" which includes Voice of America and its presence in international bodies.\n6. The country's power depends on the presence of foreign researchers. But now we are witnessing a brain drain. The decline of the United States reinforces the rise of China.\n7. Invisible exports, including tourism, are already affected by the country's international unpopularity.",
