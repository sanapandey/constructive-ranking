Putin is rational, the problem is that he believed his own hype, laundered through his own subordinates.\n\nPutin surrounds himself with yes men and people who are loyal to him above all else. He built a system where his subordinates want to compete with each other for his favor, rather than taking the risk of attempting to usurp him.  As a result everyone in Russian military and intelligence was telling him that Russia was strong, Ukraine was weak, that the Ukrainian people either wanted to be Russian or were indifferent, and no country would support Ukraine, because that's exactly what he wanted to believe\n He had trained or replaced anyone who might offer a dissenting opinion.\n\nThe belief was that Russia could deliver a crushing blow that forced Ukraine to surrender, and it would all happen so fast that the West wouldn't have time to react. All of the right wingers that had been compromised by Russian propaganda would say the reason why Ukraine fell so fast was because Ukrainians either want to be Russian or dislike their own country and are unwilling to support, why should we crucify ourselves with sanctions when Ukrainians don't even care?\n\nWestern intel knew that this was Russia's assessment of what the outcome would be, and our intel believed it was accurate, which is why Zelensky was offered a ride rather than ammunition.  It's why prior to the war a significant amount of training was in guerilla and insurgency tactics... if Russia ever invaded, Ukrainian resistance would mostly be during an occupation, because their army would quickly collapse.\n\nPutin believing this, was perfectly rational starting the war, expecting a short war with few consequences and much to gain.  If Putin in 2022 could look in to the future and see where things are today (donkeys, golf carts, North Korean troops and shells, tens of thousands of vehicles lost and hundreds of thousands of casualties) he'd probably shit himself and call off the invasion.",

A lot of it even from the man himself.  \nThey have somehow managed to find out how to leverage the internet/social media against western democracies creating an opportunity for him to - at least partially - get closer to his goals.  \nHe (and the CCP) has played us. We trade and think this will \u201cdemocratize\u201d them but in reality they just build up strength, stole all technology they could trying to catch up as fast as possible to challenge us. And in the meantime they are putting wrenches between allies for good measure and fun. \n\nMost of this doesn\u2019t make sense to me. The war and open conflict with the west didn\u2019t benefit anyone in Russia. Not the general population nor the elites or inner circle. They got sanctioned and can\u2019t dine in London anymore (what a bummer but you know what I mean). This is bad for business in general.  \n\nSo who wants this really? Some hardliner maybe but how do they have leverage over Putin if he doesn\u2019t want it?  \n\n(So much about your point b lol)  \n\nIn terms of social cohesion surely the war has its benefits. But there are also long term social consequences and demographic ones as well and I highly doubt they are worth it in this sense. Yes you have patriots but fewer and a lot of missed opportunities.  \n\nAbout a) yes I agree in principle but we also need to look out for flaws in the system that could impact his decisions.

The troops did extra training this month!  \nThat\u2019s some sort of \u201cpropaganda\u201d on its own and I think it\u2019s fair to say this will also be influenced by the propaganda he/they feed the general public.",

Well, mongol anyway, and the mongols owned China, and that\u2019s a better claim than Russia has ever had over Ukraine)\n\nSecondly because the barges are incredibly vulnerable to attack. In Taiwan they will be under so much missile and arty fire it will block the sun, whereas they can make an insta-port anywhere on russias coast and the Russians won\u2019t be able to do a damned thing about it. The Chinese could spend weeks landing half a million dudes and equipment, and the Russians simply cannot contest it meaningfully. Unlike Taiwan.\n\nThe next 3.5 years will hold the answer.

Thats an unfortunate fact.\n\nHonestly, I think Taiwan is fucked simply because nobody can afford to sanction China.

For Taiwan to survive requires too much sacrifice from other nations.  It sucks but that\u2019s my prediction.  I hope the Taiwanese make a stand that Chinese mothers whisper to their children hushed  tones for a thousand years, but I can\u2019t see them winning",

Neither are the guidance systems, the smooth and gentle acceleration required of the engines, the cushioning to prevent the payload from rattling into uselessness.\n\nIt\u2019s too non credible even for here.\n\nYes, the USA could do it if they could get that massive penetrator bomb, or rather a dozen of them, into the right part of the dam, but how are you getting there to drop it? The Chinese have an air force, Taiwan, for these purposes might as well not have an Air Force at all.",

Aside from the fact that most of their nukes won\u2019t even fire, China has extremely effective nukes to fire in retaliation for a nuclear strike on China. That\u2019s the whole point of MAD, it keeps nuclear nations safe from invasion, but the main foundation of the doctrine is it ensures any nuclear exchange between nuclear powers is always lose lose.\n\nRussia would have to either give up the territory, fight an win conventionally, or be fully annihilated.\n\nAlways remember Russia is uniquely vulnerable to nuclear attack. You need three nukes to destroy Russia as a nation, as far as the Russians are concerned. They don\u2019t care about anywhere but the ethnic Russian cities, and they never have.",

In a war with the US, the US will likely blockade the strait which will cut off China\u2019s energy supply.  The other ocean routes are blocked by the US and their allies aka the \u201cisland chain strategy\u201d. \n\nChina is developing overland contingencies to counter this threat (i.e. providing Russia with military supplies in exchange for natural gas and building pipelines/developing relations with Central Asia).\n\nLastly, to elaborate on the above comment, it would also screw Russia as their only warm water port and home of their Pacific Fleet is located in Vladivostok (a former part of China before it was taken during the \u201cCentury of Humiliation\u201d). This would take away their ability to project power in the Pacific while at the same time gives China access to the Sea of Japan as another avenue to break through the US\u2019s \u201cisland chains\u201d. Not to mention it seems that Xi\u2019s foreign policy is undoing the Century of Humiliation so they would likely press this claim when the opportunity arises. They\u2019ve done it before during 1969.",

Iran's mostly contained at this point and Putin wants/needs a breather from Ukraine, so Xi cant even rely on a multi-pronged international response to stretch out America's military power due to the haphazard way Trump is doing things.  The earlier he starts a conflict in Trump's term the better it will go for him because China still has excess men and he has purged the CCP and the Chinese military of dissidents towards his eternal rule, and the US hasnt fully pivoted to Asia nor has their 6th gen fighter, has not fully completed and operational island chain of new airbases and most importantly dont have the necessary huge stockpile of the long range missiles for air to air combat.  The longer Xi waits the worse the war will go for him especially if he waits out Trump's term because then a re-armed European intervention into the Pacific is back on the table and the odds by then would have gotten worse.\n\nPutin sold Xi up the river because at the end of the day Russia and China are only allies of convenience.  The US is pulling out of Europe which unfortunately lets Putin exert more influence into Europe and testing the limits of the EU and an America-less NATO as the US pivots from Europe to Asia because Trump seems to believe that Europe is not going to offer much help if any in a Pacific conflict so he is not going to honor a lot of European commitments, and Europe will mostly likely half-ass its commitments to the US say, like in Asia.\n\nTL;DR:  Xi's best chance at taking Taiwan is like right now before the West re-arms further and the US further entrenches its island chains around China.",

I am pretty sure they have learned better by now. \n\nHere is the problem with that sort of plan. It relies on multiple things going right in a row. Which is just not how war works. If you are relying on something like this to get your heavy equipment onto a beach, and you mess up any of the previous steps, you are fucked. If your SEAD is anything less than perfect, you are fucked. If the Marines fell to establish a perimeter, you are fucked, if the Japanese intervene, you are fucked, if your intel fucks up an the enemy is using more capable jamming capabilities than you thought, you are probably fucked. \n\nIt is easy to draw up complex sequenced plans on a white board. What sucks is when the Beachhead Commander doesn't have radio contact with half his subordinate elements, the ones he does have a screaming at him to land the heavy armor before they are overrun, and he doesn't know if the enemy artillery still has precision fire capability. If he commits two or three of these and they get obliterated, he is going to lose the beachhead. If he doesn't commit them and the enemy counterattacks before heavy armor lands, he loses the beachhead... History is not going to be fair. If he makes the right call, he will be a hero, if he makes the wrong call, he is will be removed from command (And almost certainly disappeared). \n\nThe TLDR is that this asset isn't reliable for the first wave. IF you pull it off, it makes things go easy, but using it requires getting a deep draft vessel close to the shoreline, and it is huge and valuable target. Realistically, this thing is going to be unloading an armored brigade or more. That is just a catastrophic amount of eggs to put in one basket. \n\nMy actual bet is that this isn't really for deployment in an invasion of Taiwan at all. It is probably primarily for operations in Africa and South-East Asia. Its roll in an invasion would be weeks after the initial assault, to reposition Armored Brigades along the coastline.",

Any credible invasion of Taiwan is going to take several weeks to potentially several months and not be a lightning speed type thing.  That type of thing was the thinking behind the Russian SMO and we all know how great that went.  Chinese military theory like [systems destruction](https://old.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/umy3lz/will_the_chinese_navy_in_the_future_operate_on_a/i85j8ju/?context=3) heavily revolves around the concept of creating friction.  Not at all new concept for the PLA, goes back to Maos \"on protracted war\" (which is basically Clausewitz \"at home\" or broken down to be carried out by a then largely illiterate populate), however its been very much modernized and brought into the 21st century to the point where its not too different from the DODs doctrine of operational warfare.\n\nAssuming the Chinese follow their own doctrine, not only will the Taiwanese military be drastically eroded before a landing is actually attempted, but so will likely the civillian population.  [Systems destruction actually sees military and civil infrastructure as interlinked](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1708.html) and therefore legitimate game.  With Taiwan thats really bad, because not only do they import 70% of their food and literally 100% of their energy (pretty much all of which is stored in unhardened facilities and extremely vulnerable to Chinese attacks) but their power plants, water treatment, sanitation facilities, and pretty much every other civil service you can think of can likely easily be destroyed overnight as well, same with the majority of Taiwans fibreoptic cables, basically just cutting it off from the internet.  Taipei is one of the most developed cities in the world, and also one of the most densely populated, can you at all imagine the psychological terror that would set in when this first world population suddenly not only has all its creature comforts taken away, but becomes emaciated from lack of food or water, and has to contend with literal shit filled streets.  The Taiwanese woln't really have internet at this point either, so will not know what is going on outside.  The Chinese will be bombarding them with propaganda, which if things get bad enough, a lot of the population might give into.\n\n[Pretty good writeup by a IC analyst that used to be on reddit who made a comparison between this and Mauripol](https://rentry.co/tw-human-material-state)",

There's precedent, like how Traditional Chinese characters are still used in Hong Kong... it wouldn't be such a stretch to continue that policy in Taiwan. (I mean, at least until they decide those unique qualities are politically inconvenient, and therefore must be purged.) North and South Korea are right next door to look towards; in comparison, Taiwan reuniting with the Mainland seems much less daunting.",

There's always been plenty of cross cultural collaboration and trade despite political status, so it's not like China and Taiwan have been entirely divorced from each other since 1945.\n\nI was chatting up classmate at my HS reunion who turned out to be an analyst with the Navy, specifically in China-Taiwan relations. He was of the opinion that China's takeover of Taiwan will not be military, but rather economic and political. It tracks with my experience as well-- my brother is a tech CEO in China, with factories in Taiwan. China has too much to lose to try aggressive military action, because it would just entrench independent sentiment among the populace.",

That thing looks like it would take a lot of time to set up and be an easy target.\n\n[To quote Rick Joe](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarshipPorn/comments/1jay5zq/comment/mhpsm4u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n>Prior to these barges, the vision for this \"artificial harbour\" phase of an amphibious assault involved the PLA\u00a0[using](https://i.imgur.com/Gem5gC2.jpeg)\u00a0their\u00a0[equivalent](https://i.imgur.com/dXIDzzx.jpeg)\u00a0of something like JLOTS, which of course as we've seen in Gaza (as well as surmisable through common sense), has a few weaknesses in choppy water. These new barges are likely to offer significant greater stability, as well as likely greater width of transport lanes from the sea to shore, while retaining the ability to be modular and adjust to the total distance they want the unloading ship to be from the shore (draft considerations).\n\n>But the prerequisites for these barges to be used in a Taiwan contingency, will likely be not much different to when they had their prior JLOTS-esque equivalent pier; they still exist to form an artificial pier to unload non-amphibious capable AFVs, trucks, logistics, artillery from sea to shore...\n\n>... which is preceded by amphibious capable AFVs and helicopters conducting a genuine amphibious assault and attaining an initial beachhead and pushing inwards while supported by persistent aerial sensor overwatch and fire support and organic naval air defense...\n\n>... which is preceded by days to weeks of extensive preparatory fires from air and sea launched missiles and munitions and cross strait long range rocket artillery and SRBMs in conjunction with extensive EW, ISR, ELINT/SIGINT to suppress and destroy remaining ground forces, C4I, AShM bases and TELs, artillery units and ammo dumps in conjunction with an air and naval blockade...\n\n>... which is itself preceded by an overall air-naval-missile (and non-kinetic EW+cyber) systems destruction campaign across the strait by the PLA to seize air superiority and sea control over and around Taiwan itself, involving the destruction of ROCAF aircraft and ROCN vessels either in the air or at sea (respectively) or more comprehensively at their bases and ports, while also carrying out suppression of ROC military IAMDS, and targeting high level C4I nodes and political and service level command/control as well...\n\n>... which finally would be preceded by likely weeks and months of gradually escalating cross strait political rhetoric where efforts to find offramps to military action would be extensively done by all parties involved, but ultimately end in failure.\n\nTLDR: if these things are showing up on Taiwanese beaches, the conflict has already basically been decided.",

If Taiwan is left hanging out to dry then it falls in about 70 days with around 70,000 PLA casualties and 23,100 killed. They sink about 17 amphib ships and a similar amount of escorts and take out 240 combat aircraft.\n\nHonestly there's simply not much Taiwan can do when its enemy is capable of striking into Taiwan with MLRS fired from the mainland. Without US support the PLA quickly attains air superiority and lets loose the PLARF which comftourably smashes Taiwan with ballistic and cruise missiles, MLRS, basicly nearly evreything it has in its arsenal aswell as a strategic bombing campaign led by the PLAAF. Three weeks into the conflict the Taiwanese military runs out of shells so really the outcome is without a doubt a total PLA victory.",
