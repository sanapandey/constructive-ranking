Basically it comes down to how far you can stretch the basic definition that \u201cChristians believe that Jesus is the son of god and saved us all from original sin\u201d",

Most of the footage is either Alawites being attacked (which is bad too) or just recycled media from the 14 years of war that country had.\n\nIf you don't speak Arabic, it is not easy to tell what religion a person is in Syria so all this is easily exploitable.",
