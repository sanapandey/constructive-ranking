Problem with that, as many have encountered if they thought a bit more about it, is that hydrogen doesn't liquefy at room temperature or anywhere near it, so to have any real amount of H2, you've got to keep it under immense pressure, which ruins your weight and volume gains. \n\n\"But you can generate it directly on the front line\" - bruh, using what energy source? Because generally if you have any power at the front it's coming from generators, and it should be obvious there's no gain in lugging one chemical fuel to the front and in order to turn a fraction of the energy in that fuel into another fuel. \n\nAlso, who thinks the military still uses black powder?",

Any NATO+ nation-state can easily get a 155mm artillery cannon in a variety of flavors in great numbers, and plenty of ammo for them. Given how slow 152mm shell production is in NATO+ countries compared to 155mm shell production, adapting a 152mm shell to fire from a 155mm cannon seems deeply impractical.",

The next iteration of the Patriot system is Israeli-made \"David's Sling\" anyway.\n\nHowever, there's tons of fighter jet subsystems like targeting pods and oxygen systems that for the western world seem to come near-exclusively from the US.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of heavy airlift, though Europe being a continent, this is somewhat mitigated by rail networks. Like Germany's \"green\" package probably involves upgrading and electrifying rail networks... which also directly improves capability to ship large amounts of... \"stuff\" through Germany.",

The recoil spring bends significantly in it, it's ridiculous. I'm trying to figure out what's the best angle for the slide to counter pistol recoil, and I... can't. It'll also probably look ridiculous and the sights would have to protrude to the side... Or, like, what if we get rid of the slide movement and just copy the Vector and have the recoil spring move inside the grip. I'm not even trying to be ergonomic here, at all. A pistol with a charging handle. Extra pointy, maybe serrated and barbed. For no one's pleasure.\n\nSomeone make an AI to design a recoilless handgun, with or without a slide. Wait... that smartass will just set the caliber to .00001 or it'll tell the user to do their own designing.\n\nOh, wait! Let's just install an electric device right under the muzzle that jerks the barrel violently downwards with each shot. Could be a wind-up mechanism too. Crank or rewind between magazine changes.\n\nJesus christ my mind is racing.",
