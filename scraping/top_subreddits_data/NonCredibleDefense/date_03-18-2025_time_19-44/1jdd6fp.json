Farmers understand why tariffs are bad, it's just that they don't see a lot of the material benefits of what's happening. Americans invest in stocks and understand what affects PE ratios. They understand how an income-balance sheet works so that they can invest in stocks (and also why they probs should go into VOO).\n\n  \nI'm a pretty stupid person and I understand these things (as evidenced by the fact that I can't get a job in my uni degree lol).",

Especially sale items. Without fail, there would be numerous people who couldn't understand there being a finite amount of chicken breasts or steaks or whatever we ran out of. As though animals just up and appear for them to eat. \"You sell it so it should always be in stock\" was a constant thing being said to me.\n\nComplaints about there being \"blood\" in the packaging were common as well. It's a fucking cut up dead animal, do you expect it to be dry and clean?\n\nAnother common occurrence was the fact people utterly refused different brands of chicken to substitute. The chicken used in our meat case was the exact same as the store brand ones in a package. Same supplier, same farms, same everything. I know this because we just cut open those packages to stock the case. Yet people refused to believe me that buying the package was a smarter idea. Cheaper per lb, not exposed to open air, and not being hosed with tap water all day.\n\nMy personal favorite were the truly attentive customers who saw \"marker\" on their steak or brisket. Always always calling me a liar and an idiot for explaining that it's just grape juice from marking in the factory. Then you had the few who believed me, shifting over to \"why would they do that, it's unsanitary\" in a heartbeat. Drove me insane",

Americans did the thing they did for most of the rest of the war and claimed it as a victory, but anyone who actually reads about it see the Americans landing, getting pounded and then leaving without doing anything of real strategic use, while the commies did the same thing they ended up doing for the rest of the war.\n\nWe saw Americans getting smacked several times more. Khe Sanh, Early parts of Tet. The idea that the US \"didn't lose any battles\" is actual, USSR secret reserve, levels of copium.\n\nAlso the KD is pretty hard to take seriously when the US own press kept catching the DoD adding Women, Children and the elderly to the kill counts.
