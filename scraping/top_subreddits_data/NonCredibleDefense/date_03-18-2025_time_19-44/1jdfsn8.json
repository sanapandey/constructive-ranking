                            "body": "Individually, you're looking at a big, twin engine air superiority fighter versus a small, lightweight multi-role fighter. Many of the same themes from F-16 to F-15 comparisons apply, as they're of similar generation. They're probably closely matched in a dog fight, with general advantage to the bigger twin engined plane, but with specific advantage being context dependent based on altitude and so on, and which aircraft can better play to their relative strengths. \n\nBut at longer ranges, do you trust Russian PESA versus European AESA arrays? Do you trust Russian RCS reduction versus the Europeans? Do you trust Russian long range missiles versus European and American offerings? (Notwithstanding Russia being in Europe, you know what I mean).\n\nI'd rather be flying in a Gripen, to be honest.\n\nEdit: The above hypothetical is also consistent with exercises between the Royal Thai Air Force and the PLAAF, putting Gripen-Cs against Su-27s. The Su-27 did have a major advantage WVR (although the details of the context are scarce). BVR, however, the Gripen outclassed the Su-27. Given these exercises made use of the -9L on the Gripens (rather than -9X or IRIS-T), and with substantially less thrust in the -C than the -E/F, I think the Gripen-E vs Su-35 might swing in the Gripens favor WVR (maybe not to oughtright advantage, but closer to parity). Even though the -35 is an improvement over the -27, it's not like the Chinese haven't done their own upgrades to their -27s and, while I know this is propaganda, they claim that theirs are the most performant members of the Flanker family. Given the technological and industrial gap China has pulled on Russia, I don't have much reason to doubt it (though, on balance, I don't have much reason to accept it either).",

The problem is we do not have the strength right now to support it, though our growing cooperation with Europe means when the 6th Gen fighter program kicks off there as a cooperation between companies, maybe we can get in on it. Magellan has a lot to offer, and de Havilland and Bombardier are no slouches. I think a next generation fighter built in cooperation with our friends across the Atlantic could see the home built version being called the Arrow II, and I think that's the future I'd like to see.",

Just counting all different versions since I can't be bothered to differentiate the different tranches etc.\n\n**Gripen**, [number built ~300 \\(2023\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_JAS_39_Gripen)\n\nBrazil 9 (36 ordered + another 12 - 15 expected to be ordered), Czech 14, Hungary 14 (another 4 ordered), South Africa 26, Thailand 12 (another 12 - 14 ordered). [75 exported, 135 in total including orders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_JAS_39_Gripen#Operators)\n\n**Rafale**, [number built 289 as of August 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Rafale)\n\nCroatia 12 (last ones are delivered today so I'm counting all of them), Egypt 54 (I'm just assuming they have been delivered), Greece 24, India 36 (another 26 might be ordered soon), Qatar 36, UAE 0? (80 ordered). Indonesia 0 (42 ordered), Serbia 0 (12 ordered). [162 exported \\(322 if including expected orders\\).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Rafale#Operators)\n\n**Eurofighter** [number built 609 as of January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurofighter_Typhoon)\n\nWhen counting export sales I don't think it's fair to include the countries included in the eurofighter program, meaning Germany, Spain, UK and Italy don't count. (even if it has been produced in a greater number) (the same way France and Sweden don't count towards the 'export' count for Rafale or Gripen).\n\nAustria 15, Kuwait 15 (28 ordered), Oman 12, Qatar 22 (36 ordered), Saudi Arabia 72. [So that's a total of 136 exported (163 including orders that haven't been fulfilled).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurofighter_Typhoon#Operators)\n\nSo the Eurofighter has been produced in bigger numbers, but the Rafale has been exported/ordered in much greater numbers. When comparing export sales between the eurofighter and Gripen there isn't as big of a difference as one could have expected.\n\nAll these numbers are dwarfed by the export sales of many modern US fighters (excluding the F-22 which weren't permitted to be exported).

Europe has 10x the GDP and 3x the population. The fact that Russia is even a threat to them to begin with just demonstrates their complete incompetency.\n\nIt would be as if, The United States was in danger of being annexed by Mexico.",
