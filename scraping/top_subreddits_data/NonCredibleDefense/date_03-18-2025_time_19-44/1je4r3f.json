This theme was co-opted by a certain segment of historical meme videos showing flashbacks to the crusades or fascist/totalitarian regimes implying they are preferable to modern times and this video trend took off on tiktok.\n\nIn this case OP is memeing that the nato bombing of serbia was a good time for the counties opposed to serbia at the time.",
