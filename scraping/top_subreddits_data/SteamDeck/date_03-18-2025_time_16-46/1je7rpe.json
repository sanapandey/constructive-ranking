Movies in the theatre are usually 24fps. I think most gamers that go to the movies aren\u2019t bothered by it after a couple minutes if at all.\n\nI think many people who say it gives them motion sickness only feel that way because they\u2019ve gotten used to higher frame rates. I know I felt motion sick when first getting into blu-rays at 24fps, but it was gone like an hour in and I haven\u2019t felt it since.\n\nDont get me wrong, I love 120+ fps and pretty much use the steam deck only for games that I get a consistent 60+fps. Just I see how you can easily get used to 30fps with bad graphics if that\u2019s the best that you have. Many \u201colder\u201d (not even that old, even Xbox One had many AAA games at 30fps) gamers will have grown up playing twitchy games at lower fps.",

I could also target the nintendo switch at 30fps in 720p. \n\nThese are the \"intended framerates\", only in the sense that it was optimized to reach this. It can also be playtested at this framerate.\n\nBut, in the end, what it mostly means is the devs may not give a shit about \"5090 cannot run this in 4k at 144fps\" , but also won't give a shit if \"gtx 960 can't run this at more than 30fps\".

CRTs could do more and afaik monitors after that were always 60, probably some had 50 depending on region, but the 30fps = 30hz monitor correlation is made up.\n\nYou still claimed that it is the bare miminum. Not \"for you\" but the general bare minumum. If you make such claims, you are better prepared to back that up and not by some correlation, without even proving the causation here.\n\nAnd I personally have games I prefer to limit at below 60 fps, because they don't need more and I rather safe the power.\n\nAlso this steam group would not exist, if 60 fps was the official \"Bare minimum\" for  recognized by the all the game devs: [https://steamcommunity.com/groups/frameratepolice](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/frameratepolice)\n\n60 as minimum would be nice sure. but that also depends on the hardware. Nobody will sit there and think \"oh gosh my games run at 55 fps instead of 60, It's not in the official \"bare minimum\" specs anymore I am not allowed to play that game and need to buy new hardware\".\n\nI really hope you realize what you are saying when you make a statement that 60 fps is the bare minimum and not just for you.\n\nYou really need to come up with something better here than \"30 hz monitors\" if you want to make any claim that this is not just your subjective benchmark here.",

I cannot remember the last time I turned on the performance overlay on my Deck, or looked at any kind of FPS counter on my desktop.\n\nPC gamers *on Reddit* seem to think that obsessing about FPS and technical performance is universal for all of us.\n\nIt really isn't.\n\nIf a game is hitching in a way that detracts from my experience, I'll lower some settings to get it smoother.  But I'm convinced that obsessing over that FPS number is making games less enjoyable for the folks who do it.  \n\nLike, I know that folks complain they can notice every time their games dip below 60, and are distracted by it.  And I believe them; but in all likelihood it seems to me like they've probably *trained themselves into that situation* by focusing on the FPS counter, instead of just using their own subjective experience of whether the game is enjoyable to play.\n\nIf you aren't playing a high-twitch fast-reaction-time competitive game, there's just no need to obsess over FPS.  Yeah 60 might look a bit smoother than 45, which looks smoother than 30, when you compare footage side-by-side; but if you're actually focused on playing and enjoying the game, I just can't imagine why those differences would matter unless you've actively trained yourself to spot them and be bothered by them.",

It's understandable to not be able to have a PC, but even just an Xbox Series S would run these big games much better than the Deck would. \n\nMy Deck is mainly for being able to play the indie games I love, but on the go. There is absolutely something to be said for playing a smaller game on a system that is overqualified for it. I was playing Hollow Knight on my Deck and was blown away by how much better it looked in OLED 90 FPS than it had looked on my Switch.",

Not everyone is going to open up a game and provide detailed benchmark data every time they talk about a game. \n\nAnd the argument that \"people buy their games based on other people's feedback\" doesn't hold water for me.

This wouldn't be such a big issue if it weren't for the fact that input lag is already pretty bad across the board in modern games (look at the Deck's built-in frame limiter, and a lot of people tolerate even that). They should already be working on drastically lowering it and instead they're making it worse.\n\nI absolutely champion people trying to find ways to play their games on Steam Deck that shouldn't run on it, it lets developers know there is a market, but all these \"optimization\" should be seen as the crutch they are and not accepted as good in place of real optimization.",

It's not false hope, you just have a high fucking standard for gaming. It doesn't meet your expectation, guess what? Nobody gives a shit, let some people share their experience and those who care can give their opinion.",

Especially given that the Steam Deck is extreamly affordable and can run many of these games at 60 FPS. If you want your 60 FPS so bad, go buy the MSI Claw at $1200.\n\nA solid 30 FPS on a handheld is totally acceptable for demanding titles.

Just be honest about the experience. Dont hype it up. Dont be all like \u201cIt runs at a locked 30fps!\u201d when it spends half the time lower than that while having the settings and resolution as low as possible.\n\nI remember when people were claiming Baldurs Gate 3 ran well on the deck. When I tried it the performance was sub-30 fps, fairly unstable and ran at a full 25W meaning battery life was poor and thermals were high.\n\nOr that one time a guy claimed to have Alan Wake 2 running fine. But when pressed for proof only showed a clip of the game running with the camera pointed away from anything remotely demanding and it was still barely hitting 30-40fps.",
