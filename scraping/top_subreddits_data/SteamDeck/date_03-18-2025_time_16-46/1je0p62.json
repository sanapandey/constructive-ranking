Even though I love Action games, it is impossible to play them in bed when I want to be quiet.\n\n- If heavy text based, it needs to be easily readable on the decks screen. I love visual novels but I can't stand those that the text size is either too small or the background of the text hurts the eyes.\n\nI am pretty open to any genre as long as its fun and fits all criterias.\n\nEdit:  I think I wasn't very clear in what I wanted. I do not want games that make me sleepy. I want games that keep me engaged and don't make me fall asleep.\n\n",

There are ways to get something for the brain to chew on while still following it. Instead of screen time go for a book or music or podcast or if you really must use a screen then do what you can to minimize that usage, and use whatever software built in or otherwise on the system to eliminate blue from the image (no, not reduce, ***eliminate***, it should be ugly and colors range from red to green, there should be no blue light from the display). eliminating blue light is also not an excuse to use the screen for longer either, you should still minimize screen time as much as possible before bed. Regardless of activity it should also be done somewhere that is \\*not\\* your bed. \n\nI know those restless nights all too well myself and still struggle with them, but by far the best is reading a book for a set amount of time. Using a screen in bed with blue light is by far the worst, second only to not doing anything. In recent memory when I've been up until 2 or 3 AM it's been with my phone. \n\nI gotta be careful with books too though, without a timer to put it down I can almost as easily stay up well into early morning reading a good story.",

I often watch doom play throughs of all things and I am out. I take the lowest dose of melatonin and it works for me. \n\nI spent years getting poor sleep, didn't matter if I read before bed, stayed away from electronics, etc I would just be awake for hours. I eventually tried melatonin and it significantly improved my ability to fall asleep. Now that I am on medication for my ADHD I could probably get by without the melatonin some of the time but I take so little of it.\n\nI know there are things that I can and probably should do different but I have tried a whole bunch of things and found something that works for me.\n\nI do appreciate actual suggestions and an effort to share rather then just being told I am wrong, especially when I was just sharing my experience.",

Which is why I try to make a bridge between the two when responding to them. If what you are doing works ok for you that's great. I'd be willing to be though, that if you recorded the results instead of relying on anecdote that you'd also fall in line with the results in the studies which produced the initial advice. Good enough is good enough but if you or others with a similar experience seek \"better\" the initial advice is still quite sound. My main goal here was for anyone with ADHD that happened to read it that they shouldn't just wave off the advice because they are different in other areas of life. \n\nIt's kinda like how caffeine is for me. Since it's a stimulant it actually calms/mellows me out and I can even sleep after consuming it. Doesn't mean I can ignore the advice to limit caffeine in the evening though. The other effects are still \"harmful\" to the quality of my sleep.",

That being said if you just don\u2019t like the whole restaurant management part of it, then it might not be for you. That is a big chunk of the game\n\nIf you manage to get further into the game, it\u2019s possible to \u201cinvest\u201d enough of your money into it that when it comes time for the restaurant to open you don\u2019t hardly need to do anything, as your staff will be so good that they\u2019ll take care of everything you need to do. To reach this point will take a while though, and you may need to search up tips/guides to get it running fully automated like that. Regardless my initial point still stands, if you don\u2019t like that gameplay, it\u2019s probably just not for you",

                    "body": "I could talk to you for hours about Citizen Sleeper vs Starward Vector but the long and short of it is that it\u2019s as good, narratively, as the first and more complex mechanically, so if you liked the first one you will probably like the second.\n\nThe balance issue is tricky because apparently GDM wanted to make a more complex game following a lot of commentary on the first one saying it got easy on the back half, and the big gameplay response was Contracts, these mini-missions where you go to a new location with a set objective and you have only so many cycles that you can complete it in and while you\u2019re there if you fail or even get neutral outcomes too much, crises will pop up that you have to then resolve quickly or the mission fails. They\u2019re pitched as \u201chigh risk, high reward\u201d as a way to counteract the possibility of you getting, say, a lot of money over the course of the game, since you can only bring so many supplies to a contract anyways. It\u2019s a really cool system, but I still found that by late game I was swimming in resources.\n\nTo me though the best change from CS1 to CS2 is that you build a crew, Mass Effect-style, and you can bring 2 crew members on any contract and they\u2019ll have different dice bonuses than you, so you can be strategic about that, or just choose to RP if you want. That difference, of meeting new characters who you could choose to bring along with you (or not!) and your relationship with them growing over the course of the game, was my favorite addition and makes me want to replay it even more to hang out with people I didn\u2019t as much the first time.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a different enough game to be very interesting coming from playing the first one, with the aesthetics, writing (narrative, tone and dialogue) and structure being similar enough to the first that you can confidently tell anyone who liked the first one that they\u2019ll like the second. If they can get over the new mechanics (Condition is gone, and you don\u2019t need stabilizer, replaced by a Stress meter which can cause you to break dice, but it\u2019s kind of an indirect system with several influencing elements).\n\nUnfortunately you mentioned one of my favourite games/series of the decade in a discussion thread so I had to punish you by ranting about it. They\u2019re both fantastic, and if you\u2019re waiting on a good deal for CS:SV, absolutely take your time, there\u2019s no rush and it will probably only be tweaked to run better as time goes on, just know that it will be a good time when you get around to it if you liked the first one and wanted more of the TTRPG mechanically dense gameplay.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also like twice as long, and because of the plot I think it doesn\u2019t end in as many different ways as the first. Like you could leave or stay and in different ways at different points in time in the first one, while the second\u2019s plot isn\u2019t really about that same thing, so that wouldn\u2019t work. Still, highly recommend, so far probably my fav 2025 game, no ragrets\u00a0",

The combat is turn-based, so no button mashing necessary. \n\n- it\u2019s FREE\n\n- the game is 2d and top-down, making it very easy on the deck. Its art direction is pretty fitting for night time play, also. \n\n- the text in the game is sort of minimal and very easy to read. \n\nI\u2019ve been playing it over the last week when it\u2019s almost time for bed and it works wonders. I wouldn\u2019t call it a boring game at all though. \n\nBlood is all. Thank you.",
