Don\u2019t open it up to the whole Steam community so you don\u2019t have \u201cverification bombing\u201d like when a game or publisher gets review bombed for things outside of the games. Valve should create a large moderator system for the Steam Deck verification.

Alternatively the game might have a launcher that needs touch input or mouse input.(Fallout 3/Fallout New Vegas is this category).\n\n\nVerified: Game that runs without any sacrifices or issues but that doesn't mean it doesn't have issues since lots of verified games have always online drm, third party account requirements and in GTA 5's case half the game missing because developers being lazy and using some crappy invasive anti cheat that doesn't work on Linux. \n\n\nGTA 5 should be in unsupported. Overall these categories suck and there needs to be a new category for games that work but also don't like GTA 5 where half of the game is missing despite being installed, third party account requirement (Which btw is locked to your steam so if you have no access to it, can't make a new one), always online drm, and a third party launcher as a requirement.",
