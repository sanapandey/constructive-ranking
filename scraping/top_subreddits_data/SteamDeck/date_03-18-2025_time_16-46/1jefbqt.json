Imagine my surprise when I start up the game and there are absolutely no controls for anything other than a mouse and keyboard. Has anyone else had any luck getting a controller or the steam deck controls to play this? I\u2019d really hate to have to lug around a keyboard and mouse every time I want to play MySims. ",
