You can make a game look great without running a full light physics simulation that requires beefy GPUs to run at 12 fps.\n\nThere are some cases where games should push that boundary (when the goal is to push that boundary).\n\nBut I see a lot of games that add pointless realism, usually because they are just using UE5 without a full understanding of how and why things are set up a certain way. \n\nThere's lots of games that utilize UE5s advanced features but for things where it was not necessary and ends up being massive bloat. Plenty of games that could have easily been built in Godot but instead are built with all of UE's advanced physics and rendering models (with no real difference in quality bc the devs didn't really know what UE5 does)\n\nif you want to push the graphics boundaries, you have to know what you are doing and optimize the game. That optimization helps you push the boundary further because you have more resources to play with. If you are just trying to make a game, all the fancy shit is unnecessary bloat.",
