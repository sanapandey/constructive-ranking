Also after how laughably easy all the story bosses were it was really refreshing to get your teeth kicked in by a Valkery. \n\nIn Ragnarok I'm still in the process. Almost done but I still gotta do the Muspelheim trials (fuck how grindy they are) and then start Valhalla.

These days I play a lot more indie games and only get some of the AAA titles if I really think I'll like them or if they've been out long enough to be cheap. It's rare i find an AAA title that's actually worth it. Only game series where I'll definitely 100% buy a new release without hesitation are GTA and Half Life (Half Life Alyx still stands as easily the best VR game out there and if you trust the insiders they seem to be pretty deep into developing a new game with a crowbar wielding character in an HEV suit). God of War maybe depending on what setting they pick for the next game. Kind of tired of Egyptian Mythology after Asgards Wrath 2",

An indie game like Balatro or Inscryption do way more with an inifinite smaller budget than these guys. \n\nI'm not saying by any means that RDR2 is a bad game, but it's overhyped as hell. And if you want to compare to other triple A games, Dark Souls or Bloodborne are way better, they only \"lose\" in raw graphics, which is the most uninteresting part of a game. \n\nSince we are are reaching, let me guess, like the guy above, you think God Of War, Cyberpunk, The Last of Us to be mind blowing games, the epitome of gaming because they dump millions of dollars in graphics and hire famous actors to dub characters. You think a good game design is a game that holds your hand, shoves tutorials down your throat and treats you like a baby, but hey, the cutscenes are pretty and story is like a movie, right guys?",

The main thing I'd say is that the game is VERY HARD, and it is still a fun and perfectly valid experience to play on a low (or even the lowest) difficulty.\n\nIt's also.... a bit buggy. For optimum experience I would recommend looking into installing the following mods, ESPECIALLY if you're playing on a harder difficulty:\n\n*  [Toybox](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/8). It's kinda (definitely) a cheat mod, but the game CAN just bug out, locking you out of items or even breaking whole quests. Toybox lets you fix that (and also cheat, if like, that's your thing).\n\n* [BubbleBuffs](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195). I'm just gonna say this mod is practically mandatory if you're playing on anything at or over the \"Core\" difficulty level (which is kinda PF:WOTR's \"Normal\", but there's way more than 3 difficulties). Harder fights mandate pre-buffing, and having to spend 10+ minutes before a fight casting all your buffs one by one is a real enjoyment ender. It _does_ work on Steam Deck, but you'll need to swap to Mouse+Keyboard mode as there is no controller UI for it. A pain, but doable with some clever shortcut work.\n\n\nAll that said, I'd recommend just forgetting all that at first and trying the game out. It's a very deep, very charming, excellent CRPG regardless of flaws. If you enjoy it, or run into issues, maybe then check out the mods.",

PF:WOTR has a turn based mode like BG3, but also a RTWP (Real Time With Pause) style battle mechanic where you can set some basic tactics and let the AI handle stuff while you either focus on one character or kinda jump around mixing up tactics as needed. You can also pause (as the name implies) at any point to think or set stuff up.\n\nI wouldn't play real time on WOTR over maybe the lowest 2 difficulties. Which is totally valid and I think you'd have fun. But the difficulty scaling in the game is ABSURD, so you'lll need every advantage you can get the higher you go (the highest difficulty is literally called \"Unfair\" and that is a very apt name).\n\nWOTR is overall a much.... rougher game than BG3 (I say with around 500 hours in both), but I still think it's an excellent entry into the modern CRPG genre.",

I had a really great time with it, but just know when you get to chapter 11, the story gets sloppy because they were trying to get the game out the door. \n\nThe only other gripe I had is about the post game. Many guides tell you to focus on the characters primary roles until you finish the main story, and then farm experience afterwards. I personally think that\u2019s a mistake as the leap to post game farming is kinda a high barrier and they lock you out of some of the best available spots pre-final battle once you\u2019ve beaten it. So grind some of the secondary roles out before \u201cbeating\u201d the game.  And then post game farming for experience is also quite tedious. Once you beat a few adamantoises, don\u2019t feel bad if you just want to speed it all up with an editor or something. It\u2019s literally not hard, just painfully slow and a bit of RNG involved for some drops if you\u2019re going for trophies. \n\nOn steamdeck you can force it to be 4GB enabled which helps smooth out some of the hiccups just add this to the launch options: PROTON_FORCE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE=1 %command%\n\nI\u2019d recommend using FF13Fix which is just copying over some DLLs. You can also download some nice texture and model upgrades but they require windows to properly install (can just copy the game files over after and it all works).",

It's black magic how it runs so well on the deck despite the insane fast-paced action/effects and massive maps with mechs. It can easily run at 60fps with ocassional dips if you lower the settings, albeit 40fps runs without frame drops very well with considerable battery improvements. The wild thing is this is one of the few games you don't need to lower resolution for it to run so well. And it's fantastic being able to run this game at the sharp full resolution instead of the usual watercolor 480-680p resolution most recent games require.",
