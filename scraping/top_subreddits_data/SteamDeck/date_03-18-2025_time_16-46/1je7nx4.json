    "selftext": "Im sure most people are now aware of the SteamOS 3.7 Beta Preview. But I think that some people might not understand that testing betas, especially Beta Previews, is not for the casual everyday user. I'm seeing complaints on this sub that should be properly reported through the bug reporting channels to Valve. I don't have a problem with people mentioning bugs here to see if there are easy solutions, but that's not what I'm seeing. I'm noticing people upset that things are broken when identifying regressions, bugs, and other broken things is the whole point of the beta program, especially beta previews. \n\nCheck here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/1/",
