City is usually safe (unless you cause mayhem and try to fight the whole town), so being there with a bit lower FPS is usually no issue. Outside of the main town, the FPS is usually stable for ~40fps on medium or so (which is like 99% of the playtime)...\n\n\nKCD2 with frame-generation decky plugin with XESS upscaler is quite enjoyable as well - I finished KCD2 on my steamdeck.",

Im aware of that frame issue thing, but I have no interest in playing online or against other players, and Im not sure if the frame issue is specifically for when facing other players or in the game in general. So if Im just playing the game completely solo, does the frame issue still become a problem without the edit?\n\nAlso, Im curious, because I know some people are turning down the graphic settings on it. Are turning down the graphic settings on a cel-shaded anime game really that noticeable?
