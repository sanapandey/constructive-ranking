Honestly not having a frame count in the top left made me think less about frame drops and stuff because I\u2019m not having to shift my attention to it until I see it\u2019s stable.\n\nDespite it going up to 60, I\u2019ve been putting in work in Overwatch and it honestly doesn\u2019t feel like 120fps was too much of an advantage on my TV when I used it as a monitor before the Deck. It was the lack of it dipping below 40 drastically and instead just dipping to like 90fps. But a consistent 60fps is still worth standing as a gold standard. 120+fps is great for advertising, but I doubt people\u2019s \u201ceyes hurt\u201d like they think they do just because something is 60fps, I too felt physical symptoms from unnecessary stress before.",

And then when they complain in the face of the much larger group of average gamers who don't care it kinda breeds \"exclusivity\" to the idea. kind of a \"better than thou because I don't like 'fake' frames\" mentality. Which even though it's not that exclusive of an idea still leads to plenty of people \"preaching\". \n\nIf it was latency and artifact free on deck the people complaining would instead be a very small minority. Yes it's silly now, but it's important people bitch about the current state of interpolation so that the people making this technology know it's not good enough yet. \n\nmaybe I'm just stating the obvious but I feel like this gets overlooked.

                            "body": "yeah it's certainly no powerhouse but that makes it all more surprising when pretty games run well on it. Metro Exodus, switch emulation, Subnautica, and Resident Evil 4 Remake in particular surprised me. They don't necessarily run amazingly well or with crazy settings, but the image quality and framerate they put out on the deck is genuinely impressive, at least it was compared to my expectations. \n\nLike if I said Subnautica runs at 45-90fps with occasional dips into \\~30fps at medium-high settings native res, that may or may not sound impressive to the average reader. But if you've ever played Subnautica then you'd know how poorly it can run on decently equipped desktops and the idea that the game runs as well as it does on deck is quite the feat. \n\nThat may be part of the issue for goosing numbers. it's fun to share when a game runs better than expected, and tools that can goose those numbers give it more of a \"wow\" factor... as long as no one knows that the numbers are goosed. I could've said that Subnautica ran at upwards of 110fps with the same settings, which while I've technically seen that happen it was on the main menu/early game shallow area with a GPU overclock (1850MHz lmao, 15w going to GPU alone) and TDP raised to 20 watts.",

So, this is a nice tool, but the higher the additionnal latency and the intensity of visual artefacts, the harder it backfires. \n\n**The simple fact people (and Nvidia) use it as a metric to compare performance levels is just nuts and insanely misleading.** Framerate is not only a metric used to measure motion fluidity, but also performance as latency is heavily tied to it. So mixing up \"real\" and \"fake\" frames when talking about performance doesn't make any sense.\n\nMy TV can interpolate frames too, but I never, at any point, considered my 3070m to be as powerful as an 4090 as a result. It simply doesn't make sense. Yet, Nvidia managed to market this as an \"*incredible feature that dramatically enhances performance*\" and a lot of people are completely buying it.\n\nI understand that some people consider FrameGen to be a \"god send\" for low end devices such as the Steam Deck, despite being much more of a \"bandaid\" than a solution, but **Capcom advising and encouraging to use FrameGen in Wilds to make 30fps as fluid as 60fps is just insane**. This is just a true testimony on either they lack of interest or on their inhability to optimise their games. Maybe both.\n\nStill, it's not just about the Deck, **people using interpolated frames as a performance metric are just oblivious to how it works**.",
