They used the Diegolix version of Shadps4 with the vertex, sfx, FPS and cloth mods from nexus, and most performance-based patches from Shad. They also used the 30fps patch instead of the 60, as 30 feels reasonable to me- I mean, *them* .\n\nEdit: also, they ran with a really low resolution through Shad, and this boosted performance greatly. It doesn\u2019t look great, but in the same way that the viral de-make mod didn\u2019t look great, which in a way\u2026 is great!",
