Many of those clothes you can't get for over a year. You also can't time travel without being banned. This results in a lot of players after playing for a few months being basically stuck doing bare minimum in the game but just the slow grind of resources. \n\nIn my genuine opinion it is not worth buying unless you already have an apple subscription that Arcade comes with.
