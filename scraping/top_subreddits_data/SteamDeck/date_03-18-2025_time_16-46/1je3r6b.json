There are also thumbs up from people that played the game for tens of hours...\n\nWhy are you saying this when I am the one that read them and posted them? My point is that these reviews are completely unreliable and the standards of those people running games at 25fps with frame gen giving the game a thumbs up are completely untrustworthy. \n\nIf you don't believe me, go and try those games yourself. With those \"tweaks\" (most of them add frame gen to try and get a 20fps game to 30) or simply add FSR 3 that makes the image slightly less blurry but make your game crash more often. \n\nWhat's your point or argument? I don't really know why you are disagreeing with me. I've said it's better than steam badge and you can use it, but I simply feel it has way too many unreliable sources. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with setting people's expectations accordingly regarding that.\n\n>There are also thumbs up from people that played the game for tens of hours...\n\nThey can do this and still be wrong. 15fps with crashes and artifacts is not a thumbs up regardless of you spent 100 hours doing it.",
