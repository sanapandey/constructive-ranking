It confuses so many people trying to increase performance, it doesn't immediately change anything on screen so they leave it on, and then it leads to questions like this from time to time.\n\nI don't think I've seen a case of it ever being worth toggling.",

It is usually 50:50 with games - either it visually changes nothing, or the HUD or even the whole 3D scene becomes pixelated.\n\nThey should hide it by default and have an option to show it in QAM burried somewhere in advanced settings.",
