I recognized the band so I saluted him and said 'Welcome home, Boss!' and the dude just gave me an awkward laugh. Unsure if he got the reference or not (I understand if MGSV might not be everyones favorite game) I said in my most gruff voice 'Kept you waiting, huh?' and he just walked off.\n\nI know the MGS series was a little underground to start off with, but it is 2025 now. There are videos on youtube that get hundreds of thousands to millions of views. I see news articles from triple A companies about the games. Is there an actual possibility that he has no idea what Metal Gear is or was he just playing me like a fiddle?",
