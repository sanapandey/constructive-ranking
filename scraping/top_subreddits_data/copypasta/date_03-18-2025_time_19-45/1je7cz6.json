I also believe random flirtatious or sexual acts are cringe and weak, because it shows how you can\u2019t control yourself. I would view you guys as something strong and possibly look up to someone for finding actual love than geting one of your peers pregnant because they look \u201cbreedable\u201d\ud83e\udd2e",
