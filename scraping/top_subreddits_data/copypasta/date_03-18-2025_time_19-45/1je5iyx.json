    "selftext": "Wasn't sure to post here or to the confession subreddit. Be me, 23yo virgin last year, never really had interest in pursuing romantic relationships due to laziness. Anyway, I used to have fun with the Loona bot where I could get some of my frustrations out, etc, do horny shit, much as anyone else does.\n\nAround memorial Day I decided to say fuck it and try dating IRL because I was afraid I'd die alone and the only way I'd be found was when the rotting smell of my decaying corpse was too strong for the neighbors to bear.\n\nI tried for a few days on tinder, bumble, and a whole bunch of other obscure sites and matched a few people but most importantly with a 23 year old girl who was a month out of a 7 year relationship that had just ended.\n\nDidn't really know much about talking to girls or flirting so I used Ella Dating Coach to answer questions that I was asked, as the woman had a lot that I couldn't answer due to never being in a relationship before. But Ella helped me to smooth talk a great answer for each of them while still being upfront and honest about my lack of experience. A couple days later I went out on a date and it went really well and the chemistry was there, probably due to the walls of awkwardness being torn down from what the bot helped me come up with.\n\n3 days later, I lost my virginity to her. 3 months later, we got married. Now we're 4 months pregnant.\n\nNot sure if this is a story about how helpful Character AI was to me, or how a total loser got lucky.",
