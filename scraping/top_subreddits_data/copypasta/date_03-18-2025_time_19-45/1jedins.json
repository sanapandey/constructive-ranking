    "selftext": "I've been staring at the hypotenuse of the male character Bill from the series Gravity Falls created by Alex Hirsch\n\nI began to study his structure, it took me about 10 minutes of me looking for .png rulers that I found on Google (and I also discovered that an equilateral triangle doesn't have a hypotenuse)\n\nAnd given the fact that Bill's suit is very thight to his skin (this is very obvious since it fully shows his spiky corners). Bill has a hypotenuse of around 5 cm long and a width of 1.5 cm\n\nI added the fact that the average depth of a man's anus is around 6 cm and the fact that it can stretch\n\nBasically, to please him you would need around 13 cm. With 47 you can hurt him but I think he's a masochist so he likes it and with around 90 cm you can kill him\n\nOr that's what I would say if he was human, but since he isn't and it's known that he can shape shift as he pleases then he could have some very slimy and wey tentackes down there that could make having sex with him for hours a lot easier without hurting yourself or feeling any pain, and with his incredible regenerative power he could get dicked all day (unless you pick his eye by accident because you want him to suck you off, then it takes a while for him to regenerate), by all sizes and shapes, and even after all of that come for more. Bill is literally made for human cock",
