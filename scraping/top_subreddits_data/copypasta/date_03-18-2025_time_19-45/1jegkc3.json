    "selftext": "I just need to rant for a little bit. Aptos is the most hideous, ugly, horrible font of all times. It makes my skin crawl. I especially hate how it's been forced as a standard font in the theme, it's despicable. Calibri was the perfect font, stylish, good readability, classy, nothing wrong with it. Aptos is like Calibri's fat, creepy uncle that you never want to invite to any family gathering because you can be sure he'll do more than just ruin the vibe, he'll absolutely destroy it.\n\nI have tried to manually change all the style defaults back to Calibri Light and Calibri body, but Word automatically switches it back to that horrific Aptos font. This is criminal. I hate it, and hate Microsoft for pushing unecessary change in our faces.\n\nJust let me use Calibri with ease man, it's all I have in this world, it's all I ask for...",
