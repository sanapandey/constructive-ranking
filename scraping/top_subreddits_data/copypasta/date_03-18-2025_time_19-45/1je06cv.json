I thought Hamas was a terrorist organization, that Israel had a right to defend itself, that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014things were more complicated than a few angry tweets made them seem.\n\nBut then I met a very wise activist online who changed my perspective forever.\n\nI was scrolling through social media, sipping my coffee, when I saw his post: a black-and-white keffiyeh wrapped around his profile picture, a bio filled with powerful words like resistance and genocide, a username with at least three underscores. A true intellectual.\n\n\u201cYou support Israel?\u201d he asked, quote-tweeting me for his followers to see.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I admitted cautiously. \u201cI support its right to exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo you love apartheid and genocide?\u201d\n\nI stopped. I had never thought of it that way before.\n\n\u201cB-but Hamas targets civilians,\u201d I stammered in the replies. \u201cThey started this war.\u201d\n\nHis response was swift. \u201cYou mean their legitimate resistance? Against oppression?\u201d\n\nA chill ran down my spine. Could it be that launching thousands of rockets at residential areas and slaughtering families in their homes was actually an act of justice? Had I been blind this whole time?\n\nI tried to argue. \u201cBut they hide behind civilians.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they have to,\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause Israel\u2019s bombs leave them no choice.\u201d\n\nI felt weak. \u201cBut\u2026 but Israel warns civilians before striking.\u201d\n\n\u201cFake,\u201d he said. \u201cPropaganda.\u201d\n\nI gasped. Propaganda? I had seen the footage myself! The leaflets, the phone calls, the drone warnings! But he had said the magic word.\n\nAnd then, the coup de gr\u00e2ce.\n\n\u201cHamas had to do October 7,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was the only way to be heard.\u201d\n\nIt was like a 50-megaton nuclear explosion went off inside my brain.\n\nI collapsed onto my bed, my phone slipping from my hand. My breath was shallow. My vision blurred.\n\nHow could I have been so foolish? How could I have believed that a democratic state defending itself against an internationally recognized terror group was anything but colonial oppression?\n\nI felt the critical thinking leaving my body. The nuance drained from my soul. I suddenly could no longer remember why I thought slaughtering civilians was bad when the oppressed did it.\n\nWhen I finally came to, my Twitter feed was filled with new wisdom. Words like context and resistance had replaced murder and terrorism. The innocent were no longer innocent, and the guilty were victims.\n\nAnd for the first time in my life, I understood.",
