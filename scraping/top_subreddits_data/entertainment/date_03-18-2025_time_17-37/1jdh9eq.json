Or even say a Jeffrey Dahmer on a micro level. So then if your argument is caveman were brutal my rebuttal would be so are we? So.... What's the similarity. Well we are literally the same human beings we quite literally have the same brains as Cavemen. \n\nBut on average no the normal human being isn't a Jeffrey Dahmer or the other examples. That's what made humans successful. It's no different than caveman. So you can show me one billion examples of caveman brutality. I can show one million of modern brutality.

What I can say though is that yes he has committed antisocial behavior that is not in line with average human psychology. Most humans don't have the urge to strangle women, and that is not because of some societal construct. If you do then you really need to get yourself checked out. Are you suggesting that's normal or average? It's not or societal pressure that stops the average person from doing those things.",

The whole point is that Majors\u2019 behavior is abnormal (and that goes from abusers in general).\n\nNo, they aren\u2019t debating philosophy and rights, but that doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t have their own sophisticated system regarding nuanced behavior. It doesn\u2019t make any sense for strangulation to be a mating norm. Even looking at our closest biological \u201ccousins\u201d, not even apes, chimps, or monkeys do this and we have a common ancestor in there somewhere.\n\nIf someone has the inclination to strangle their romantic partner, they\u2019re likely going to kill them more times than not.\n\nPart of the reason we believe cavemen were hyper violent is because we\u2019ve framed ourselves as civilized, so they must be brutes.\n\nHowever, there were many biases brought into archaeology and anthropology. Such as the hunter-gatherer myth of men doing 80% hunting and women doing 20% gathering when, in fact, that number is flipped. When also weren\u2019t (completely) excluded from war.\n\nYou\u2019re also making assumptions to why these cavemen may have fought\u2014primitive nature. At least those cavemen likely fought for valid reasons, the \u201ccivilized\u201d bunch have fought to spread religion, over oil, to keep people away from water they need as well, to control a population, etc.",

An educated, professional woman tells me one thing. So I go and ask my friend for his side. Obviously, he would probably say \u201cOh, she\u2019s just one of those crazy bitches.\u201d So now where am I? Am I meant to just take his word? Let\u2019s look at the motivations: What does she have to gain by lying? Well, nothing. I mean, absolutely noting at all. What does HE have to gain by lying? Preserving his relationships, preserving his image as a relatively good person, perhaps even avoiding jail. Being honest about such behavior can do hm no good. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s keep in mind that we\u2019re talking about a LITERAL crack addict here. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the overall point here: You\u2019re working from the assumption that the world is full of \u201ccrazy bitches\u201d who will make shit up just to hurt a man. But I know that domestic and/or sexual assault happen roughly 24 times PER MINUTE in the US and that, for women who fall victim to these assaults, there is often very little physical evidence that can be brought to see justice served. So I work under the assumption that men are monsters more often than women are \u201ccrazy bitches\u201d and, as long as an allegation is credible, it should be believed. \n\nBecause the alternative is being a fucking asshole who says things like \u201cjust because she is an educated woman doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be one of those lying crazy bitches.\u201d \n\nAbsolutely fucking disgusting.",

He states: \"It is a diary form of writing. All that 'I used to be cruel to my woman / I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved' was me. **I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically \u2013 any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women.** That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peace. Everything's the opposite. But I sincerely believe in love and peace. I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence. I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Better\n\nTook fucking 6 seconds into google to bring up **the** song he wrote about beating women.",
