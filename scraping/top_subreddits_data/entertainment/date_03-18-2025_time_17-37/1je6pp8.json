He tried to back off initially, like he does with moth things.\n\nSo it was less about free speech, and more that he's a dumbass who didn't know what the fuck he was doing. As much as he wants to seem smart, he's not and is just lucky he was born into wealth, because he probably wouldn't be in any positions of power if he wasn't.\n\nIs he evil, and authoritarian, and actually against free speech? Yes he is, but I feel like people forget about him backing off the Twitter deal before being told that he HAD to go through with buying it.",

I told him how low high yield interest accounts were first term, and he ignored it. I told him how removing divisions of power is bad he ignored it.\n\nThis man now thinks Zelenskyy is a dictator and not a hero. And blames Ukraine. I\u2019m like dude you should be stripped of your veteran status. I don\u2019t want you taking my money to help you. Fucking go be a sucker and hit that battlefield one more time.\n\nI think they had a word for a black person that pandered to white people in the 1920s. He gets all his info on TikTok and thinks literally all news is a lie and doesn\u2019t understand how to read, research, verify. He thinks if it\u2019s not Fox News it\u2019s bad.\n\nHe also thought Kamala Harris was the president while Joe was, and that she was running things and thinks she\u2019s incredibly dumb. I\u2019m just like dude, have you seen gas? Those precious eggs you keep talking about?\n\nWhat about when we have to go to war because no country trusts us to keep our word based on a 4 year cycle. You\u2019re cool with losing more military? And he just rolls his eyes.\n\nI\u2019m done talking to these dumb fucks. They should all be stripped of veteran status. They may have served us honorably, but saying Russia is right, and not understanding how this will affect wars moving forward makes me just want them all to be stripped. I get first amendment but we need to start declaring terrorist groups as terror groups. MAGA is the one I\u2019d categorize as a terror group and Biden should have manned up and sucked DoJ on all of congress and justices to find out who did actual seditious activity and arrest them for treason. And the. Have emergency voting in those states to replace those officials.",
