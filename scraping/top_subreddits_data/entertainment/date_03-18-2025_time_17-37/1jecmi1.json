They\u2019re talking about who *owns and develops* the product; a celebrity *endorsement* via a commercial campaign like the Garnier campaign isn\u2019t the same thing and positioning yourself as the *creator* of a product like Kanye is to Yeezy fashion or founder of a brand, a la Jessica Alba and the Honest Company. \n\nAnd to be clear I\u2019m not at all saying that Jessica Alba personally formulated every product sold by the Honest Company, or that Kanye actually sat down with design tools and sewed up his own patterns - they hire researchers and product developers and branding people and marketing teams to do all that and they profit from it. But as the founders of these brands, they\u2019re ultimately responsible (as would be any CEO) for ensuring that the teams they hire are responsibly developing their products, aren\u2019t making false claims, etc. \n\nTina Fey is basically questioning whether these actors and celebs that have no qualifications in the fields that they\u2019re entering - *as founders* - deserve the public\u2019s trust to lead knowledgeable teams and put out safe products (she specifically references supplements). And Amy P is basically saying \u201cthe public trusts it so you might as well start your own brand.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not advocating team Tina or team Amy in this debate, just pointing out that *celebrity endorsed campaigns* are not the same thing or type of business deal as *celebrity owned brands.*",
