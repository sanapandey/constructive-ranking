                    "body": "You mentioned that it \u201ctakes a lot of courage\u201d to willingly out yourself. Let me give our family example:\n\nMy husband and I are liberal, and we have close friends/family who are gay that we see as often as possible (they don\u2019t live nearby). These individuals have known our teenagers since birth, and are at every family gathering. We love them and wish we could see them more often. \n\nAdditionally, our kids have always known that we\u2019re supportive of the LGBT community as we frequently talk politics and social issues in our house. We\u2019ve even jokingly said, *If any of you guys identify as LGBT+ that\u2019s cool\u2026* \n\n**Even with the repeated confirmation that we would be supportive, our oldest daughter was fearful to come out to us.** She came out as Bi a little over a year ago, and admitted she was terrified that we would \u201cstop loving her.\u201d Both my husband and I felt awful that she was afraid to say something sooner because we support her completely. Of course we reassured her, everything turned out great, and we took her to the local Pride Festival last year \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\n\nSo in my rambling way, I absolutely 100% agree with you! It takes a freaking TON of courage to willingly come out, especially in today\u2019s climate. My daughter was torn up, and she came out in the best possible conditions\u2014 with two supportive and loving parents.",

Then it\u2019s suddenly not ok and that\u2019s where teens get kicked out and shunned. That fear will ALWAYS be present.\n\nI also grew up in a very supportive household, and still it took two years for me to gather the courage to tell my parents.",

Even with that, it took me MONTHS to come out to my mother. Prior to coming out, I was a mess, my grades fell, I was depressed, anxious and even fell sick.\n\nIt took so much out of me to admit that this was who I was, regardless of how my family was accepting. It\u2019s very hard to understand from the outside I imagine. Once I came out I changed completely and it was obvious just how much of a weight lifted from my shoulders.\n\nSo yeah, I understand how it could\u2019ve been hard for your daughter. You might\u2019ve been the most accepting and caring mother (which I have no doubt you are), the war deep down when you have to come to terms with who you are is extremely draining and terrifying.\n\nAnd all of this pales in comparison to our trans brothers and sisters who are truly fighting for their very right to exist at the moment (I love you all, stay strong)\n\nOk, I\u2019m rambling too! Your story made me a little emotional this morning :_)",

You still question and are fearful because society at large, even in liberal and progressive communities, are still heteronormative and culturally push straightness.  \n  \nUnless you have access to a queer community, in the United States you are growing up in straight culture. Things like realizing your life won't have children in the traditional way, marriage in the traditional way, relationships in the traditional way - every visible cue of how life is supposed to go, suddenly comes into question: what does my life path look like? How will my friends react? How will my parents react? Am I sure? How will my crush react? Can I no longer use the locker room?  \n  \nIt's a million anxieties and questions and unknowns at a time period when you're already an undeveloped frontal lobe and bag of hormones. It's not rational, it's an emotional response to a world that is still very exclusionary to queer representation - even in the most progressive spaces.  \n  \nEven if they can't articulate any of this the core feeling is: I am different and different is bad.",
