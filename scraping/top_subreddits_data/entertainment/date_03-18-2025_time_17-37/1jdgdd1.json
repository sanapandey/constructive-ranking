That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been. And we can\u2019t keep it from him anymore.\" \n\n\n\n>Seth Meyers asks if they're young teens, which Olson affirms, saying they're 12 and 14.\n\n\n\n>Meyers then asks if they ever try to get away with things like comedy bits, since they're entering their teenage years.\n\n\n\n>\u201cListen, they\u2019re both very funny. But at this age, the sense of humor they\u2019ve adapted from us is just so horrifically inappropriate,\" jokes Olson. \"We\u2019re like, \u2018Ooo! You\u2019re so close! Like in a few years, you\u2019re going to fine-tune that and be so funny, but you can\u2019t say that at school.\u2019\"\n\n\n\n>\"It\u2019s really, it\u2019s such a fine line. I mean, they make us laugh, but it\u2019s a fine line,\" she continues. \"I talked to my therapist about it, and she was like, \u2018Okay, you can laugh, but what you need to say is, \u201cNow, I think that\u2019s funny, but let\u2019s imagine you\u2019re out in the real world. People don\u2019t understand who you are. They might think you\u2019re a rapist or a murderer.\u201d\u2019",

                            "body": "I just googled this and found several articles about it. I don't think they've tried to \"scrub the internet of the incident\" as much as it happened in 2012, they were sued and the situation has been settled one way or another.\n\nThere was a reddit post four years ago where someone said: [Kaitlin did mention this on a Instagram a few years ago when someone brought up this incident on one of her dog posts. She seemed to speak with a lot of regret and remorse about the incident, but of course Instagram makes it impossible to find posts like these.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IASIP/comments/pbjpeu/comment/hacgnni/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) So I'm sure it's just something they don't like to talk about because of the regret they likely have.\n\nAlso, saying their dogs were running around freely makes it sound like they were roaming the neighborhood and attacked a baby. The incident happened at their house. Sure, they could have put the dogs inside or leashed them, but if the mother of the child was so worried and asked them to leash the dogs, why did she allow her daughter to pet the dog? From a Metro Philadelphia article about the incident that references the mother's blog:\n\n[Even the dog\u2019s owners were clearly horrified and shocked that their dog had done this. Z was petting the dog when out of nowhere the dog snapped and attacked her viciously. This happened within a foot of me, and Z was thrown to the ground, badly bitten on her face, and the dog had her pinned down on her back on the ground. The right side of her face was so severely bitten it was no longer connected, save one small area.](https://metrophiladelphia.com/professional-acupuncturist-sues-always-sunny-stars-for-alleged-dog-bite-ofbaby/)\n\nShe was so concerned but was allowing her daughter to pet the dog and was within a foot of the whole thing?\n\nHer blog post was linked in that article but the post isn't even on her blog any longer. [https://www.realfitmama.org/2013524national-dog-bite-prevention-week/](https://www.realfitmama.org/2013524national-dog-bite-prevention-week/)\n\nI don't know though. Just seems odd to say they're trying to scrub the internet of this to try and paint them in some villainous light.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nEdit: I searched her blog and found a post talking about the accident and she doesn't seem to harbor any negative feelings towards the family. The post is titled [The Power of Prevention ](https://www.realfitmama.org/the-power-of-prevention/)and she says: \"The dog that attacked my daughter was an older, friendly, kid-friendly and much-beloved family pet. The owners were as shocked as we were that this happened. This was a dog with a loving home, with small children in the home, and who played daily with kids and showed no traceable signs of aggression.\" She talks about the statistics of dog bites on small children and what parents can do to help prevent these types of accidents. I also think you're a little out of place calling the dog untrained and I have not found anything where the dog was aggressive or they were asked repeatedly to leash the dog.[ A TMZ post says: The child's mom, Julie DeLagarde, says she let it be known she didn't want her daughter around the dog ... but Kaitlin and Rob (who are married) did not leash the dog.](https://www.tmz.com/2014/06/16/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-dog-bite-lawsuit/) Yet again, she was letting her daughter pet the dog. \n\nLast point, it wasn't a birthday party, it was at a Father's Day party. So yeah, there were probably a good amount of kids there, but I don't think it was as overstimulating as a kids birthday party like I saw you mention in another comment.",
