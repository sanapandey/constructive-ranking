That thing wouldn\u2019t really be \u201cus.\u201d We wouldn\u2019t wake up in another body.\n\nOf course we\u2019re talking about sci-fi video games and movies, but it is a fun thought experiment to see if we would ever shut our eyes and die in the real world and open them in another construct. But not even media has attempted that, as far as I know. It\u2019s always just a copy.",
