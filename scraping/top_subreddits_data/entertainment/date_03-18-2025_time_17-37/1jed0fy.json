He's a human with flaws that people love to pick apart because it makes us feel righteous to be judgmental.  I don't mean that condescendingly, we all do it.  \n\nBut you're just defaulting to the negative and then feeling indignant when nobody is coming along for the ride when the overwhelming evidence is to the contrary.  You are assuming that he mistreated or did a poor job raising his son because he became an addict, but you leave out the part where that son is the one crediting him with his sobriety and talking about how lucky he is to have him as a father.  Because you're only giving credence to the parts that confirm what you already believe.",
