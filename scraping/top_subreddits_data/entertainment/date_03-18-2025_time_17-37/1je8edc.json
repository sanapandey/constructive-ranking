I got pregnant when I was on the show, and of course the show dealt with it by making fat jokes,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cOne of my favorite memories is Dylan had a line that was a fat joke, and he just kept skipping over it. It was like in the middle of a chunk of dialogue, so he kept skipping this laugh line \u2026 And finally we get in front of the studio audience and he skips it, and the executive producer screams, \u2018Cut! Dylan, say the line!\u2019 And he goes, \u2018I would not disrespect any woman that way, let alone this woman. You write something funny and I\u2019ll say it.\u2019\u201d\n\nKim Rhodes said this about Dylan. I\u2019m glad that was a safe and respectful environment for everyone.",

I think the thing that I took the most was my relationships. That\u2019s my family. I love them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n>\u201cBeing on that show was really special because I was able to go set every single day knowing that I was in a safe space, getting to do something that I could only ever dream of doing,\u201d she says. \u201cStepping into the most amazing shoes every single day and playing my dream character and having fun, but still being able to be a kid while doing it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n>\u201cI feel like it's just set me up for so many things in my life that I feel like if I hadn't gone through that I would not be able to handle it the way that I did because of that,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was such a beautiful experience. I look back on it, and yes, as with everything, there was ups and downs, but that is probably the most obviously life-changing experience for me.\u201d",
