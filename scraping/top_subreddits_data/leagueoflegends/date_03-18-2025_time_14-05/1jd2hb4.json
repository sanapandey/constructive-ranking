I feel like my game sense is alright and I have an understanding of concepts and things, but my mechanics and actually playing the game is seriously lacking. I was wondering which lane I should play to best pick up and learn the game controls, as well as beginner champions I could try to learn to get more situated. Preferably I'd like to learn a champion that isnt in Wild Rift, but if Lux or Garen is best for getting acquainted, that's also fine. Any help is appreciated :)",
