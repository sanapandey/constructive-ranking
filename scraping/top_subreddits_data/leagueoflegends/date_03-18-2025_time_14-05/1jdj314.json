Performance wise he was MVP but he can honestly be pretty patronizing and borderline disrespectful with his attitude. Some people get annoyed at how much Crownie talks but he doesn't throw small fits in the same way.\n\nI don't think its anything too bad btw, im sure its nothing worse than what most other teams have",

There is many moments baus wants to fight and velja wants to fight and nemesis, crownie, rekkles dont. The team actually has a really good balance in playstyles but i think Crownie and Nemesis do sometimes want to play overly safe which i think will punish them vs the better teams i get why they do it they want to scale and help carry and not int the game more but sometimes you just need to encourage and go agro. Because baus will be in a good spot and want to go agro then gets ditched or called back and ends up doing something stupid.\n\nThis also isnt to say that nemesis, crownie and rekkles are not way better also cos there insane lol but they often view the game similar and play high % plays even when ahead instead of punishing.",

While they do have 3 ex-LEC players, it was quite some time ago for Nemesis and Rekkles, and they have someone new to competitive in Baus. Other teams have players that have been grinding T2 for years at this point, as well as players with brief LEC stints. They also often have much stronger systems behind them with positional coaches and tighter scrim schedules that include LEC teams. \n\nSome notable players you might know are Isma/Exakick on KCB, Dajor on BIG, Kaiser on LH, Armut on SUP and Sertuss on IJC. But there are other players like Boda on GK or Bean on BIG whose LEC debut is overdue by this point and who are at or above the level of their LR counterparts. \n\nI think LR struggling this much against NBS is surprising, but fits their weaknesses very well: They just aren't as drilled as these teams and rely on individual outplays and spontaneous plans. They are still working out here, but I would be surprised if they could hand check KCB like this. I wish them the best, but I still think it would be a bit crazy and very hypeworthy.",

Plus the KCB coming into EMEA is not the one who did the LFL split, between Piero visa problems the the junglers micmac, i be surprised if KCB didn't struggle during those EMEA.\n\nPeople are really selling the LFL and probably didn't watch them. The level in LFL this year was way lower than the past years. For KCB, the lost of Caliste and Vladi has hurt a lot and 3XA/SlowQ are not them. As for the rest, the level is really not there, the sole fact that Solary of all team, manage to get Top3 prove that the level drop a cliff. I personnaly think that the LFL probably not gonna make it into Finals of EMEA this split, unless KCB woke up.",

I base this opinion off the fact that so many reviews post game he brings up the fact that no one is playing around him to allow him to carry the game. Syndra is extremely immobile obviously and very susceptible to dying on side lanes. If jg/sup don't play around him it's hard for Syndra to be able to farm safely / make plays. \n\nImo you can see it this game - I'm sure he could position better but it's also an extremely hard game for Syndra to play - Ashe / Xin flash ori r combo / ksante etc. There is probably a some reasoning that velja / rekkles should be closer to him to help prevent this from happening as easily. \n\nI could easily be wrong and am only a random redditor commenting but I do think there's a world where I could be correct and it should be discussed.",

She\u2019s one of those champs where once you die a lot in the early game, you\u2019ll have no damage without gold and you\u2019ll start to chain feed. I remember long time ago, people were demanding that Caps must get banned in soloq EUW because he was chain feeding and averaged 0/10 on Syndra 10 games straight. It\u2019s because she\u2019s actually one of those champs where you either pop off, or you run it down; no flash and missing e = dead.\u00a0\n\nI also agree* Nemesis is getting the same APA Worlds syndra treatment in this Reddit thread.\u00a0",

Comms are pretty rough too, like they're just not on the same page. It's like the break between NLC finals and EMEA Masters hurt the team, because everything they learned regarding communication from day 1 LR and now is gone.\n\nImo it feels like Crownie lost his confidence after the lane swap patch and because the lanes are rough, Rekkles becomes quieter too since his confidence is a bit volatile as well.\n\nI'm happy that they won but they need to fix their mental, otherwise this version is going to get beaten by KCB in a stomp. They clearly have the skill to do so.\n\n/Edit: You guys can downvote me all you want. I'm a rat, I bought every single merch item there is and I support the team with everything I can, but as a fan you have to make the difficult call-outs that are obvious.
