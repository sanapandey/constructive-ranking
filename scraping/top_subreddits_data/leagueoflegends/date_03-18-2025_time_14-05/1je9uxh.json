            "body": "God these are all fantastic. Especially Shaco.\n\nI think this is a perfect example of how much better the skins can be if the skins get to be more diverse. That Shaco has SO MUCH personality and unique stuff to how it moves and animates and everything, because it's so different from the base Shaco. It's a full on cartoon character so he gets to have crazy exaggerated movements and animations. Obviously his base model and animations are ancient and not helping, but still there's a clear divide between a regular clown/jester and full on Tom from Tom & Jerry.\n\nCompare that to the Battle Academia Xayah where they changed her from \"The Rebel\" to... a rebellious teenager. Of course there's not going to be much difference in the animation there, she's basically the same character with just slight differences. Legendary skins should be more like Shaco here, really reinventing the character even if it's in a similar thematic avenue, letting the animations then feed into that distinction more.",

                            "body": "True, there's definitely a layer of just creative freedom of thought put in on some of them. Though Dark Cosmic Jhin does kinda do the same shift as Shaco here: similar character vibe (full of himself artiste) but there's a shift in the concept's material that makes it really stand out (normal guy with guns into cosmic god the size of galaxies with multiple arms). His more \"alien\" nature lent itself to more creative animation choices.\n\nI guess it's not necessarily the character that has to change to really stand out, but moreso some core factor of them. The Best Legendary skins need to drastically change something. Be it the personality (Coven Nami), their activity (Corporate Mundo), their scope (Dark Cosmic Jhin), their concept (Space Grove Blitz & Crank) or their medium (Soul Fighter Viego, Cat Shaco). Something that REALLY sets them apart.",
