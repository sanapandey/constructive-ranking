They said they're going to give her an English one once the strike is over, and she's got the voice in other languages from what I heard.\n\nThe real problem is how the skin has nothing else a Legendary should have either. All the extra animation work was put into the cape which is barely noticeable. On top of the skin itself just being very boring IMO.",
