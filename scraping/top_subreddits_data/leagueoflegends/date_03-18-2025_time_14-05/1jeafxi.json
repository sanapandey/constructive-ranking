    "selftext": "Now how comes that Xayah's legendary skin is not even close to Shaco's? I mean I can tell just by looking at it:\n\n* The quality.\n* The mind behind it and the creativity.\n\nThese are all putting Shaco ahead of it. It's not a complain it's a welcome change. Xayah should get some extra work like Seraphine and get released later to get a proper legendary skin. \n\nShaco will open my wallet and I do not mind if the Xayah skin will do the same.\n\nPlease keep quality skins coming which can be bought with RP.

Just make skins that make sense, they don\u2019t need to be accompanied by lore, a music video, a team of other champs that all have the same shit in the skinline. The toy cho\u2019gath skin is literally the best one they\u2019ve released in years because it just makes sense for the monster to have a toy form that\u2019s clunky and awkward and goofy. Idk about you all, but I had tons of dinosaur toys as a kid and the toy Cho\u2019gath hits that mark PERFECTLY. \n\nAnd not to say some skinline skins aren\u2019t great either because they are, but there are some other skins that I think hit the mark really well:\n\n-Legal Eagle Azir\n\n-Pool Party Zac\n\n-Surgeon Shen\n\n-Hot Dog Naafiri one coming out soon\n\n-Papercraft Anivia\n\n-Dunkmaster Darius\n\n-High Noon Lucian + Senna\n\n-Zombie Brand\n\n-Pizza Sivir\n\n-Forecast Janna\n\n-CORPORATE MUNDO\n\n-Giant Enemy Crabgot",
