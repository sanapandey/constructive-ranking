    "selftext": "I was playing ranked solo/duo and it looked very bad, we were behind in all lanes, kills, drakes and stuff. So then our ADC who was 2/8/2 decided to leave, we wanted to surrender but 2 people vote no.\n\nEverything went dogshit and then shortly after our adc dipped, suddenly the screen went to the nexus and it said we won, the enemy team had surrendered.\n\nSo what happened? Apparently the enemy team had an afk too , their jungler dipped for just a few minutes, and they probably didn't know yet that our adc dipped as well. So they FF'ed.",

But in case you want to learn about the topic, there's extensive research about this topic you can find with a quick google search.\n\n>Negative Events are Remembered with More Accurate Detail than Positive Events. The research comparing memory for negative and positive events has begun to reveal a fundamental influence of valence on memory accuracy. Negative information often is remembered with a greater sense of vividness than positive information. \n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2676782/#:\\~:text=Negative%20Events%20are%20Remembered%20with,of%20vividness%20than%20positive%20information.\n\n>As outlined by Baumeister, people typically attend more to negative information than positive and weight losses more than gains\n\n[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9196161/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9196161/)\n\n>Nostalgia's a thing for a reason.

Everyone knows the maxim that \"anything can happen in bronze\", and this mindset sticks in people's heads permanently, even when not in bronze, but it sticks in their heads *the wrong way*.    \nIt means the enemy can make a major fuck up, not know how to close, get outmacroed, etc. People take this to mean \"they can be outplayed\", and they completely forget that gold lead will make a shit player win a fight purely by statchecking the enemy. So they keep throwing themselves at a stronger enemy, giving them a bigger and bigger gold lead, under the impression that \"I can outplay him, anything can happen in this elo\", when all they're doing is cementing a loss.",
