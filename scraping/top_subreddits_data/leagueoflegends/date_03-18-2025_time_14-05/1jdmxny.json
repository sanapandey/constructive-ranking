Beside noway they are all good enough to play in a region where they can live of their performance.\n\nJankos hat a lot more viewer and NORD is content for his streams.",

He said himself, that he would probably burn out again very quickly if he kept the level of tryharding.\n\nHe also said himself that there are very few viewers who enjoyed the scrim content (understandably - given the long breaks/analysis) and he had less viewers than when streaming soloQ. And for some of the other players it was a test on how much of a viewership they could build based on the team, but turns out it wasn't that much.",

Top lane: Photon (korean academy import), Jungle: Bo (chinese import after being banned from that region), ADC: Neon then Upset, Support: Kaiser. First half of the year they look decent (5th in Winter, 3rd in Spring) but they missed MSI qualification. Summer they change jungler to a Polish rookie Daglas and team completely implodes finishing last.\n\n2024: Perkz moves to Team Heretics to join a roster with a bunch of old G2 players (Wunder, Jankos, Flakked) and Kaiser again as support. Team fails in winter split, Perkz's mechanics look like they've completely collapsed and the team finished 7th in Winter. Then while preparing for Spring, Perkz got into argument with a member of Heretics management who flew in from Spain to watch scrims. It got heated and that management person dismissed Perkz from the team on the spot. So he's teamless.\n\n2025: At this point he's basically retired but is convinced to join Ruddy Sack in the NLC ERL for a content team. Original aim was to not tryhard but they looked shaky and part of the team (Jankos/Humzh/YamatoCannon/Dom) realized they need to work more. Perkz (and LIDER) disagree and didn't want to work hard, so the team doesn't scrim enough and gets knocked out of playoffs by an unknown British team of okay players, an ancient support who used to be high pro level (Kasing) and an unknown cracked ADC rookie from Bulgaria (Exofeng). Perkz played top lane on this team (which he's not good at) and based on his level of effort/flaming of other players on team/not good relationship with Dom/YamatoCannon/DonJake, it's over.",

You don't have it in you to grind league like a teenager when you're in his spot.\n\n\nTheir support was turbo washed unretired expro who peaked at a mediocre team in NA years ago.\u00a0\n\n\nHumzh seemingly fucked off back to NA, I'm not even sure if he's returning to Ruddy Esports and Europe. What a waste of time it was for this guy. Genuinely feel sorry for him.\n\n\nYamato is like the biggest coaching fraud I can think of.\u00a0",

He keep it for content and entertainment but at this point why you even had coach if he is doing nothing. I still don't think that he is biggest fraud as coach as lol coaching scene is joke and there are probably bigger fraud in lec even now. Most of them are guys who were to bad to play as player so they assume coaching role without any qualifications to have it. At least Yamato can sometimes motivate some players.",
