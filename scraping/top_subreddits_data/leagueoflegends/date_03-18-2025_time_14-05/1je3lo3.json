I already checked it, I made her a bit darker... unfortunately when cutscenes happen depending on the surroundings she either looks too dark or too bright. \n\nI had to install ReShade and a mod just to make the game look decent. Also have the lighting to my liking. Besides in this camp tent it's too bright. \nIf I go outside Samira has her natural skin color. I am actually soo proud tho. I am happy you guys like it ^^",
