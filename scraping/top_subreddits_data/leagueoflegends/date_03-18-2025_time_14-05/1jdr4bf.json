Don\u2019t get me wrong, when you\u2019re REALLY ahead on him he feels great, and landing a big R + W is always super satisfying, but he feels so clunky (I think intentionally) and the way you play him is unlike any other mage, and not just because he\u2019s a jungler. \n\nHis whole kit is really weird, and it feels like you kind of have to always be on the offensive with him to be effective while also keeping them away, if that makes sense. He is the champ that most rewards playing around vision, with most to gain and to lose from it. ",

Once you reach lvl 9 your W has no CD or mana cost, and your knees come back in about half the time as early and keep gaining til like lvl 13 or 15(idr off the top of my head)\n\n>I don\u2019t play urgot but isn\u2019t he strong early? I thought he\u2019s a lane bully that gets outscaled by range.\n\nIt depends, if a CC/artillery mage is top lane, yeah you're going to have a bad time until you can build MS and MR/HP. If you build him right though, he can eat through a majority of team comps right now.\n\nI played him a lot after his rework even after he wasn't very strong, so I've got a lot of comfortability on him. Vayne or Quinn top aren't really a big problem though. Riven, Garen, and Gwen are more annoying imo\n\nGoing back tho, yes he can be very strong early into lots of champions, the main thing is watch out for his Flash E combo, if you eat that then get Q'd and eat all of his knees yeah that'll kill most champs",

It works well with Hullbreaker if you can cancel it and use the item proc with an auto attack since W reduces your \"on-hit\" damage from items",

Annie is so much more reliant on said CC from her passive.",

People act like her kit being easy to use is the whole story.\n\nIn most matchups, you don't have the range to trade back so you spend the entire lane phase getting bullied for free. \n\nWhen you do have the range to trade back (ie. against melee) you often can't justify doing so if they have any sustain whatsoever because you will run out of mana before you kill most melee laners.\n\nYou get out-shoved by actually everyone. You need to level Q first because you do not have the mana pool to afford to cast W on the wave early game.\n\nThe ENTIRE lane when playing as Annie outside of low elo is just you trying to not die until your opponent hopefully overextends and you ult them. That is your entire gameplan.\n\nTelling people to play Annie to learn mid is awful advice, even if the playerbase has decided that is the case. Annie doesn't DO half of what a midlane player is supposed to be learning to do. She doesn't play for prio, she doesn't waveclear, she doesn't trade. She is just a one-note gimmick that scales.",

If u put yi into Me for example it's a free win because I get perfect lock down and its my agency, all team has to do is right click on the yi when I catch him.

However he\u2019s difficult because his passive makes you path differently, his Q is very slow making it easy to avoid, he does more damage while in bushes so you wanna try to keep fights around your bushes and wrong bush placement can benefit enemies more than your own team if you are not careful, especially if enemy jungler is rengar, and his ult requires constant control to use correctly. It\u2019s also more difficult that he can\u2019t get any epic monster objectives on his own since he does more damage so he\u2019s way more team reliant.",
