You design a system where u face equally skilled opponents. If u are better than you opponent u rank up to keep you winrate at 50%. simple as that.",

Which is that the vast majority of players are very inconsistent, so the lower the ELO, the more you feel like the games you lose have nothing to do with how you played (which is the case sometimes).\n\nSo the reason why people think they are better than they are, is because they tend to compare their peak performances with the worse performances of their allies. But they never compare their worse performances against their best allies.",

Tickle a bruiser or a tank and keep his ult until he is danger or his team is around as you are not going to duel anyone that has stata to tank your initial burst.\n\nPersonally that's the reason I avoid those champions.

I am also playing against people who were like me plat/emerald before reset, so how does one climb if game sets you at exact 50%? Over time that 50% will lower your LP gains, so inflated gainst won't carry you much. (Granted in 5 games I am already up in Silver but still)",

Not saying you cant get back to Plat/Emerald, but usuallly across a large enough amount of games, if a player stays in a rank/division, is because that's where they belong. Sometimes it's not that you are the reason for losing games, but you aren't impacting winning enough.\n\nI play Rell, i have games where i suck and cannot land a single engage, i have games where all i do is run around someone playing really well and let them carry, and there are games where my engages make the biggest difference. But in all cases, i cannot win alone, i do rely on my teammates damage to get to the win.\n\nIn the long run, the 40-40-20 rule tends to apply to everyone. 40% of your games you will win regardless of how you play, 40% you will lose regardless of how you play, 20% of your games you will be who makes the difference between winning or losing. \n\nLike you, i was constantly Plat/Emerald for the past 5-6 splits, last split after taking a break was placed silver, after 200 games i couldn't get out of Gold. This split after reset i started Silver again, and for the past 2-3 weeks i felt like i was cursed, i would promote to gold 2, then demote next game, then promote, then demote, then loss streak, then slowly climb back up. But in the end, it was up to me to adapt and get a better grasp of my mental, now im 2 wins away from Plat (im bound to lose a game soon enough).\n\nIf i focus too much on my teammates performances then i have no chance of climbing, i just gotta look for ways to impact winning regardless of game state.",

You are just as good as the rest of the players.\n\nImprove a bit, and you'll win slightly more, now you might climb to gold. If you are now at a gold level, you'll win 50% here, until you improve even more, and so on. If you play an extreme amount of games, say 4000 on a season, you will with utmost certainty be around 50% winrate due to the volume and your skill level. \n\nTo go back to the example, say that you by chance win 8 games in a row while still being gold level, you just got slightly lucky, the game will now pair you against platinums, but you arent plat level yet, so you lose more than 50% of the games, cause you are being outmatched.\n\nThe game will match you up against better and better opponents until you reach 50% WR.

And as you have lost, you are supposed to be a weak player, so you will face weaker ennemy, which will result you stomping them.\n\n\nAnd now imagine, the enemy midlaner that has won his lane 3/1, and see his botlane 0/10... He will be deranked...\n\n\nAnd it goes both ways, as your top laner might be 0/3, he will be ranked up because of your performance not his, and next game he might be the 0/13 guy that has ruined everyone's elo, but he won't do that on purpose, it's just the system has ranked him up, while it should rather deranked him even if his team win, he still didn't have the level.\n\n\nOfc the problem of doing a ranking based on individual performance is the risk of exploits is too high of seeing people focusing only on their kills/kda/farm, and ignoring team objectives, so it's probably better not to have it.\n\n\nBut let us stop pretending the actual system isn't unfair and that everyone deserves their elo.",

Those two games won't influence your win rate overall because one cancels the other. If you won 55 games out of 100 (55% WR), then you lose a game because your top is 0/13, and then win another game because enemy jungle is 0/10, you remain at 55% WR... just don't get hung up on those games because these are just 2 out of 102 games you played.\n\nEdit: If you don't get it, the game you won due to enemy team's 'bad luck' is also just not reflective of your own performance, so it doesn't matter in the end, if you're performing well in your other games then you'll still keep your 55% WR",

What exactly can Riot (or anyone, for that matter) do about this? *Inting* is something that CAN be changed by Riot, but feeding without intention is not. The only one with the power to do something about this fact *is the playerbase*, but adjusting their expectations to reality: To understand that you _don't know your real rank until you play a lot of games_, and that it's _fine_, it's not a big deal.\n\nTo correctly assign a rank in few games *is impossible*. Every additional game reduces the margin for error, but there's nothing you can do about this. Unless Riot displayed a Confidence Interval statistic that decreases every game (Say: you're Gold 3 +- 10 divisions if you've only played one game, Gold 3 +- 2 divisions if you've played 100). And we all know that people would immediately change their perspective to \"Oh hey, I'm gold3, so I COULD be <insert whatever is best for their argument>\".\n\n> Imagine you are support, you finish your lane like 5/0/3, meaning you are probably at least slightly better than the actual elo, but your top lane is 0/13, and during teamfight you get ofc destroyed by the enemy top laner.\n\nIt's far more complex than this. A 5/0/3 support *could* be considered losing if it's a massively lane-dominant champion combo against a duo that, despite feeding you that combined score, did so to keep up on farm, and will enter the midgame with more parity than the score would suggest.\n\nThe reality is that people *feel* strongly about game states but fail to understand that *they aren't good enough for that kind of analysis until very high ranks (Master+)*, and there is no stat you can look at to give you that. The only thing you know is that you are the only constant in a 10-player match, and if you are consistently stronger, you'll rank up, but individual games matter very little, and stats matter even less. You see people come out of lane 10/0 in Bronze and be unable to close the game, whereas you place a lead like that on a Challenger player and they'll bulldoze a low elo game on their own regardless of role. The score isn't everything.",

But still lose 200 LP and get a massive downgrade in match quallity from the resulting lose in mmr.\n\n  \nLikewise i shouldnt gain massive amounts of LP and MMR when i play like utter sht but get carried.

This is absurd to think about in the context of League where rank 1 players frequently lose to people thousands of ladder positions below them, and so doesn't form a good basis of comparison. \n\nThe winrate thing is important to bring up because every piece of winrate massively increases your climb speed. I can climb an account from Iron to Gold in under a week because I won't lose a game. But climbing D2 to masters can take me a couple weeks on its own. \n\nI haven't really experienced league becoming meaningfully slower to climb over its lifetime, just the additional splits forcing more time investment (which, for the record, made me stop playing ranked -- I simply don't have time to climb through diamond every split).",

I only get there when I play hundreds of games per season, and most seasons I don't play that much. When I'm D4, I'm much better and consistent compared to when I'm just picking league up again after a break and struggling in a lower Elo. And that is PRECISELY BECAUSE I'm constantly practicing the game against higher and higher level opponents when I'm doing a climb.\n\nLeague is a SKILL based game, and when you're not grinding, your skill level is rapidly going down. You're not getting your repeats in, you're losint your muscle memory and you forget things that you previously took into account instinctually. Reaching D4 after 200 games doesn't mean that you're now innately a Diamond player. It means that you're a player that in one season put in the work to momentarily reach the skill level of D4, and once you took a break and stopped putting in that work, your skill level dropped.\n\nIf you truly had the skill of a Diamond level, you wouldn't struggle at all to climb from low Elo back to diamond. Any actual high Elo player I know has never struggled to climb to high Elo in League, whether it's on a fresh account or an old one. \n\nI have many friends who are generally gifted at video games (they quickly reach top ranks in whichever game they pick up), and they can pick up League after not playing for a season or two and be in Master in 100 games. They don't have to grind to climb, because their skill level doesn't drop so drastically during a break. I'm not one of those people, and very clearly neither are you.",

The game isn't going to put you against weaker opponents forever because as you win more, you climb and face stronger opponents until you are fighting people at the same skill lvl. This is why people who buy boosts usually end up back at their original rank once they start playing on their boosted account again.

Chess always has the same starting variables while League has factors such as autofill, picks and bans, and champion and role comfort levels. All of these can create major skill gaps within the same rank.\n\nConsider this: A Silver enchanter support main could get autofilled to jungle where they have minimal experience compared to their main role. Their actual impact in that game could be far below what their Elo suggests. \nYou could argue that players should get comfortable with all roles before ranking, but let\u2019s be real. We have all encountered headstrong players who queue up anyway, not caring if they are subjecting their teammates to this. You could also argue they should ask to trade roles, but what if no one is willing? Their only options is to play. Unless you consider dodging (-5LP & a warning). There are plenty of things players could do to fix these issues, but yet here we are still seeing them. A lot of the solutions to these problems are easier said than done. So much so that Riot is more likely to make a change than those type of players.\nEven if matchmaking is meant to create balanced games, why do we see scenarios like one team with three P4s and two G1s vs another team with one P4 and four G2s? If matchmaking is truly fair, why do role mismatches and rank gaps have the potential to create so many lopsided games?",

The entry cost goes up as you rank up.\n\nIn a system like that, higher ranked players, by definition, either kill more or win more than lower ranked players. The system has to work like that in BR games to facilitate stratified K/D ratios. You can't have a rank with all 2.0+ K/D players if  they are only just killing each other, it will average out to 1.0. Higher ranked players in BR games have to feed off of lower ranked players. It works just like an ecosystem. The low ranked players are like Plants, they generate RP (energy) simply by existing, the higher ranked players are like predators, they need to kill lower level players to maintain K/D and rank. In Apex, low-rank-only matches are net RP generators and high-rank-only matches are net RP losses.\n\nLeague, of course, is not like that. We expect a 50% win-rate in our game, but we have to remember: not all ranked systems work like that, and not all people who come to league expect that kind of system.\n\nI agree, OP.

Someone will inevitably tell you that you should have scouted and it's your fault, because in general if you scout you can see if your line is contestable by other players and avoid that line instead.\n\n\nBut if a person with all AP items contests an AD line there is flat out no level of scouting that will catch that. Advice can't account for freak incidents where someone is just strongly underperforming to the level of the lobby. BUT if it becomes common knowledge to tell people \"some games you just lose with no recourse\" then they begin to find those lines in all of their games and review shifts from \"What line could I have played that would be resilient to missplays\" to instead \"what did my opponents do stupidly that prevented my line from working when it would have normally\"\n\n\nIf we extrapolate this philosophy to League it becomes \"how could I have played out this game to increase my team's chances of winning\" into \"what did my teammates do to decrease our chances of winning\"",

That is all assuming that the outcome comes down entirely to your personal skills, which is 100% not the case. Even Faker could lose a game in Iron 4 because the game is designed to be about 10 people playing at the same time, with a shit ton of variables at play.\n\nWill Faker win 95%+ of those games? Maybe so. But in reality, personal skill only gets you so far eventually. The system is set up so that you'll reach where you belong after hundreds of games, where you can see how far your personal skill will take you on average. Autofilled junglers 5 games in a row? Rage quitters on a losing streak tilt queueing? There's only so much your skill level can skew the result of those games, and Riot is well aware of that, but they leave it at that because queue times, and to make sure that there's a reason why you should keep playing.\n\nIn Chess you keep winning until you start hitting obvious walls that will keep you there until you improve, in league you can have a lucky streak that inflates you beyond where you belong, or a meta champion that is inflated enough (Doesn't happen that often but it DOES happen at times).",

When we say, \"Riot tries to make your matches have a 50% winrate,\" all we're really saying is, \"Riot tries to match you with other players as similar to your skill level as possible.\" In theory, there's nothing about Elo that requires it to be used this way. Chess tournaments, in fact, rarely do this, and it can be argued that Swiss actually accomplishes the opposite, where matches are paired such that there's as few 50% matchups as possible. Many seeded systems actually encourage the better player to win more.\n\nHowever, ladders like League's ranked often do pair players against opponents of similar skill instead. Whether this is fair (Why shouldn't better players win more?) or fun (Nearly all players think their winrate deserves to be higher than 50%.) is debatable, but at the very least it ensures that weaker players feel like they have an even chance, and preserves the playerbase at the bottom of the ladder, which is required for the health of any matchmaking system.",

All were kept at 55%+ wr and trust me, I could win 70%+ easly if not my team mentality blaming all on supp pick and giving up quickly.

Even with your damage output, it's not out of the realm of possibility that your weird supp pick was the problem. Did your team already have tanks and utility before you picked Teemo? As a supp, your job isn't necessarily damage output. It could be. But League is so darn fluid that without watching the entire game, including draft, no one can make a good judgment on whether your supp Heimer was good or not. But I will say, you know what it's gonna do to your teammates mental state, and you do it anyway. So that's partially on you. When I play supp, I make sure to pick a traditional supp simply for the fact that it's gonna give my team more confidence",

Half of the people (even in Master+) do not know how to play those correctly and it's way easier than dealing with mentally issued ADCs. Winning in this game is easy, the same issues are on the other side and all what is needed is just keeping cool and focus.\n\n**The problem I mentioned is when you just go something out of meta and game is not going as planned.

They have not made any statement yet to confirm or deny performance based matchmaking on League of Legends.\n\nNote this isn't \"losers queue\", which in fact doesn't exist. The game doesn't force a loss by matchmake one team's MMR to be lower than the other, they still strive for a balanced MMR, but they likely do balance the performance so there is a equal number of high performance and low performance players on each team.",
