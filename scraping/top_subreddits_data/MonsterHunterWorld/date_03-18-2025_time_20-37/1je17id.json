Got him second try; I fainted twice on my first attempt, abandoned and restarted, then ended up killing it without fainting. Regardless, it was a very fun and difficult fight thats now one of my favorites (alongside nergigante, seething bazelgeuse, and stygian zinogre).",

I relied on wallbangs, mounting, traps and if I got lucky, paralysis from my Palico and stun from my weapon. Outside of that I mainly did chip damage and learn his moveset so I can get better at dodging as the fight went on.\n\nDue to this the fight did go on fairly long (especially since I couldn't use traps and didn't have slinger ammo in the last phase) but it was more so trying to find the right opportunity to attack than actually struggling against the guy.\n\nI've also seen quite a good amount of people take days and weeks to kill this guy, some even quitting the game because of brachy so I was expecting him to be a massive wall. But he wasn't too bad for me thankfully",

Typical solo time with sns could easily be 7-10 minutes, and that's not speedrunner by any means. If you stop him from phase transitioning, skip to p4, you can do it faster.",
