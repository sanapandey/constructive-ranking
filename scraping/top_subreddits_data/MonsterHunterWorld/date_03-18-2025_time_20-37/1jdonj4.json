    "selftext": "Joined a Silver Rathalos SOS, I believe it was an investigation in the Elder's Recess. 4 people. 0 faints. \nWe finally defeat it. But before it finishes falling to the ground the game said quest failed. No one fainted. I had just healed us. \nWas the person who sent the SOS trolling? They didn't leave, so I don't understand what happened. \n\nRIP. Hadn't played for like 6 months. Was most likely a capture quest. I haven't made that mistake in literal years haha \nI feel dumb! Thanks for reminding me \ud83d\ude0a",

IIRC while most monsters become capture-able at like ~20-30% hp, these 2 arent capture-able until like 5-10% which means it can be really easy to not realize how low they are and kill them by accident",
