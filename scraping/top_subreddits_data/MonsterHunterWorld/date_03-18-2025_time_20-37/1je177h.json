                            "body": "What MR gives though is the clutch claw and the power of wallbangs. Wallbangs deal a HUGE amount of damage, which is a fixed amount of 2.5% health. Then you can do it again and wallbang again. This doesn't sound like a lot, but you can at the same time tenderize, deal insane damage on the wound as it lays on the ground and the HP threshold for weak monsters like Anjanath is at around 20% to capture it. In other words that's like removing 20% of it's HP. And while MR weapons don't really deal 3x damage (it's actually not far off with better armor and deco which you get over time), the main difference is that you hit HP thresholds on parts of the monster faster, causing a stagger or even downfall, giving way more free hits which again build up breaking of parts.\n\nSo the combo is claw > turn > wallbang > claw > tenderize hit once > drop to attack > claw > turn once > wallbang. After the third hit (each turn requires a single hit plus the one to get close to it ASAP) the spot is tenderized, with 5% damage from wallbangs and insane damage from the monster laying on the floor flailing. This can easily chunk off a total of 10-15% HP in half a minute (or way way more if you got a good loadout against the monster). Keeping in mind that the HP threshold to trap is 20%, you only have to deal another 70-75% damage to it. The downside is that it's angry, but a good use here is the pitfall trap as it takes longer to breakout and gives good attack openings on the head, which is tenderized.",

The way they went about it too like I understand the thought process of certain weapons taking less times to tenderize and they really wanted the game to be played as multiplayer that's very obvious with wilds release but it's a little irritating some weapons take more times to actually tenderize with such a short window.",
