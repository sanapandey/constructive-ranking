When most of or half of it disappears you need to heal.\n\nI'm a LS user and we're not known to be healers but I often find myself focusing on my Teammates Health and basically being a white mage. \nHeal guys just heal yourself. Its okay, it doesn't have to be a speed run. You're not from Team Darkside.\nAlso bring Dust of Life and Life powders. Help keep your team out. \n\nThat's what grinds my gears.",
