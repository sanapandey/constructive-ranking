    "selftext": "Basically, I've been having a lot of weird lag lately.\n\nWhat happens is that I could be playing normally and suddenly I can't craft anything, I can't join or see any quests and the background music stops, as if I'm with high ping. If I do try to craft anything while this is happening, the game just freezes for a while. I've already tested and I'm 100% it isn't a Internet issue (I tested this by being in a call with friends and there was no ping while in call). I already have installed \"Stracker's Loader\" and \"Performance Booster\". They are both in their latest version and the same issue keeps happening. One day, I could be playing as if nothing is happening and on the other one, it becomes literally unplayable to play. \n\nI've tried to search the Internet for answers and I've tried their solutions but to no avail. It's not RAM overflow because I don't leave the PC on all day. I'm convinced that this is a game issue and I don't have any idea what's going on. \n\nI come to ask you fellow hunters for help because I don't know what's happening anymore. ",
