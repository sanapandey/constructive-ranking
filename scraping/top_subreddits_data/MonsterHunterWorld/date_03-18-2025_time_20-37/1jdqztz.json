Drake, my second, has Fatalis gear from both solo and team hunts.\n\nAce: Great sword, long sword, sword and shield, and dual blades.\n\nDrake: Hammer, hunting horn, lance, gunlance, switchaxe, and charge blade.\n\nWren: Insect glaive, light bowgun, heavy bowgun, and bow.\n\nThis gave me a reason to play the game three times, while still able to have new experiences. I don't have such rule for any other title, though. \n\nDon't know when I'll play through it a third time, though. Maybe after I reach MR 999 lol",

While I'd like to get my buddy back on GU to play some more, he has been busy with other games.",
