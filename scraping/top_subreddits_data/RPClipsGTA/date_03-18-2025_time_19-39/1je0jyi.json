The ancestor of the GTA character was founded in RDR and steeped in dark magic with the bruha residing on the isle of guarma. The stories connect back and forth with each other and he has beautiful transitions from RDR to GTA. In his interrogation later he even slips by almost stating his ancestral last name of Lopez. He puts on a masterclass in interrogation as they cannot distinguish if he is truly missing memory or is the Edgar they know to be extremely cunning and a person that is yet to leave an interrogation with the police be completely out classed. The lawyer in the one from last night was Sylas and did very well, but if you watch previous ones with Robin they are pieces of art were they are nearly completely each others sentences and effectively playing with their food.",
