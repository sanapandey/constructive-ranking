How does that make any sense?",

Arcadia had a slight hiccup skipping a step but it was quickly fixed and they have begun scheduling.\n\nThis was always going to be the issue with this system, anything crims don't like will be able to be contested and voted down. This time they just happened to run into a motivated Flippy on political stuff as he's been considering a run for mayor himself. People will claim they didn't read it, but multiple Hydra members read it and all agreed it was terrible for crims.\n\nMost crims are ok with a change, but they want the new or the old system, not both. If you wanna run the new \"strike\" system, then start fresh, no grandfathering.",

                                    "body": "I think the main negative is that amount of vafs based on the current vehicle class times x amount being directly fined for them, so they can't just leave it in the impound lot until Strikes fall off. And with non-violent falling off vs violent falling off, there is more leeway for them in that instance, as they can do pickups and get Felony Obstruction or Reckless Evading rather than the Accomplice to Robbery etc. so don't get the permanent VAF on that anymore. Just gotta be smart about things. I do believe Aus24 (Davenport) mentioned on stream a while ago that PD were asked OOC about ideas to change it, and this is what was bought up/agreed on. And he was a pretty big advocate for the criminal side of things.",
