From my best understanding. Penta got Kyle to go with him to ONX, Kyle didn't like the way super early ONX didn't have anything because (imo) it wasn't ready and launched for GTA Week on twitch. Kyle bounced and went back to NP and apparently Penta didn't know and felt like he was sort of betrayed.",

Looking for a YouTuber who used to RP\n\nThis would have been 7 to 8 years ago (during PlayStation 3 days still) maybe more and I used to watch the guy religiously until for some reason he had his YouTube channel removed or he moved to another channel with 5K subscribers and it didn't last long after that. I remember that the guy used to be a big YouTuber though.. he had a funny high-pitched voice kind of and he used to say 'dewwwwwwd' a lot. Funny asf. On his channel I remember his page had like a car in Grand theft Auto v with a license plate that had his YouTube name on it.. that probably doesn't really narrow it down too far... The only other thing I remember about the guys that he had like a double 'o' in his name, and if I remember his name used to start with an 'f' or a 'v' maybe an 'n'?And I think he had a New York or Chicago accent.. maybe. somewhere around that area I think at least.  he just had a really funny voice when he was doing RP. If someone could help me out that would be wonderful",

Hopefully it doesn't come off as an impossible Goldilocks list of requirements.\n\nI generally prefer 'Medium RP' where particularly egregious behaviour isn't tolerated, but everyone isn't instantly calling 'Fail RP' or Rules Lawyering each other's behaviour rather than having storied interactions and experiences. I also tend to prefer lower-commitment RPs due to real life constraints (Its why I like SS14 as Roleplays effectively finish in hours, not that I expect something similar in GTA RP)\n\n* Ideally, the RP Server I want would:\n* Not be a Pay-To-Win time-sink (Boosters, microtransactions, slot machine skins etc.)\n* Not be massively unbalanced towards Police/Law Enforcement; waaaaay too many RP servers I've been on overbalance for police both in terms of equipment and rules, leading to RPers who inevitably become incapable of actually handling conflict or employing social skills (which is like one of the fundamental skills for a police officer lol) outside of repeating laws/rules ad nauseum\n* No overly zealous time commitments (e.g. log in X amount of hours every week/month or be demoted/removed from role)\n* Realism that doesn't border on 'No Fun Allowed' (Which is a roundabout way of saying 'no toxic admins')",
