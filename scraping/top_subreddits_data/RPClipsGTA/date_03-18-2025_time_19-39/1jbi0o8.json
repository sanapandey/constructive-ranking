            "body": "Context: Lang met with Pestilence today.  Pestilence reveals that he knows about Lang's Timelord and Talon arcs.  After giving Lang and CJ a mission to kill Norman Bones (Pestilence feels Norman is corrupting his duties as death, making deals with people for torture when they should be a force of nature to demand, and not transact with mortals).  Lang, seeing the full gravity of the situation, finally reveals to CJ a lot of the backstory about himself, including Talon, Edwin, and revealing that Edwin is currently trapped in Shadow's sword while Lang is protecting the book of Talon as that is the only thing keeping Lang alive after Lang received his blessing from the Fountain of Youth.  At the very end, Lang reveals that he always knew CJ wasn't crazy.  But given the situation and Lang's reluctance to step into his old life, he was gaslighting CJ to try and get her to stop digging deeper and dragging him into this.\n\nFor CJ, after months of being gaslit into thinking maybe she is crazy, she finally gets the reveal that she is in fact a sane person.  W day for CJ",

He texted her some encouraging words about not letting her go to oblivion and that they'd get the artifact before logging off. Today had to be so cathartic for her.",

Insanity loves company!\n\nEdit: what if this become a Parsons Asylum arc before it's over, with the state incarcerating the followers until some sort of civil unrest happens and it all blows up in public?  Who knows where it's going.",

They need to HIRE 5-6 \"quest giver\" roles for nopixel dedicated get paid hourly or have a salary. They can use lite meta and have access to dev menu or a limited version of it. The fact that burn was not offered a permanent role like this is insane to me.",

There were a lot of people who wanted that kind of stuff in 3.0 and had hopes they would start 4.0 with \"quest giver\" characters but nothing came of it. Heck just look at all the wasted potential with roosters or the secret rooms in the liquid library. \n\nI dont even think they need to hire anyone because a lot of people would do it for free.",
