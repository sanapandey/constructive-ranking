Dripp established Quangle prior and is pretty good on knowing when not to take it too far due to him being a cadet in BCSO under scrutiny on the other hand.",

                    "body": "There were a couple points in 4.0 in which people had to make choices between a high standard PD and a low standard PD. Every time they (different people at different times) chose low standard PD. Started with constantly 2-1 overruling the captain that held the highest standards (and did not just talk a big game). Continued with replacing the captains completely. Then the replacements chose to promote Denzel instead of firing him. And ultimately Nino choosing Daisy Moss + Peters over Vivienne Grey. At each of these points someone could have gone for the high standard and accountability route. No one did. Now there is no way back anymore. It's easy to go from strict standards to lower standards, but it's almost impossible to go the other route. And it certainly is impossible with people in high command that never want to punish anyone they consider to be 'their team'.",
