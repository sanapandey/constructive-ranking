Characters that are not in a gang, don't have the same opportunities for crime. Also, eu Np feels dead most of the time. Petty crime doesn't get priority and response from the cops.

Feels like city balance would be well served by some silent heist jobs that would not involve police, and a steep reduction to the frequent Jewelry/Bank truck/Maze Bank triad.\n\nCops responding to NOT ONLY the big crimes but also traffic stops, drug sales, house burglaries, car thefts, city events, etc. helps create a lot more RP for everyone, not just top-5 gangs.\n\nThere are other issues, too: it seems like crime is hard to get into for anyone who isn't established, but if you're a top gang, it's too easy.  The success rate on jewelry, bank trucks, and Maze Bank is extremely high.  Top gangs have people with 20+ cars, engine-swapped everything, and supercars.  Cops can't keep up with 75% of crim cars in a straight line.  Cops are almost purely cosmetic on those heists.  Maybe one crew member or one car gets caught, but the loot is secured.\n\nBut anyone new to crime without a huge bankroll and stack of cars, if you drive a local car, the cops are now using engine-swapped modded cars to try to keep up with the top crims, and they're inescapable for a local car without a cracked driver.\n\nIdk, I feel like the mechanical balance is not good, and it has been screwing the economy for civs and non-crims to have near-perfect success rates for crime.  Many civs or people who didn't grind from day 1 ended up being unable to buy houses because the crims are so rich they bought them all.  I also think the payouts could be higher if the success rate were lower, and as a viewer, I prefer more intense, high-risk heists where I know there's a serious risk of failure and arrest.\n\nI don't know who's responsible for overall game design and balance in NP, but it doesn't seem well done in 4.0.  The excessive grindfest early and the total lack of balance between cop/civ/crim factions as well as the unbalanced economy now?  Not great.",
