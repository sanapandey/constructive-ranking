                            "body": "They had other options - but most of all they didn't even need another captain for shift 1 in general. Shift 1 already had multiple high command members and at the time Trygg, Peters & Skye did not want her in high command. But Nino likes Maxwell, so he pushed for it. (Now you might say that there was the conversation with Turner that made Moss realize that Maxwell was one of her 'stars' and act accordingly - true, but Maxwell was not the only one mentioned as one of the 'stars' of shift 1, and none of the other names got any push or support.)\n\nIn general it's a bit of a weird thing were they now removed the power and shift-lead from Lt. and gave it to the Cpt. role. A chain of command with 3 Cpts. but only 2 LTs. does not make much sense to me. Chain of commands are supposed to get smaller towards the top.",
