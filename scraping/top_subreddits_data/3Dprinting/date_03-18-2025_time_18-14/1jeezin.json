Ive had several over the years from og wooden kit and more modern makerbots, ultimakers, lulzbots, couple of Creality models, I gave em all away over the years and had about a 4 year break, then in 2024 I got the K1, I\u2019d spent the entire 29 days of its return policy trying to get it to work, rooted the firmware, shimmed the bed, it just was hot garbage, come to find out later they were lemons at first, but the damage was done. I returned it to microcenter and was about to write off the whole hobby\u2026 then I saw the X1C at the store, and the Denver microcenter employees had been printing - a life size iron man suit, with full color and silk elements - fast forward a year and I have 5 of em now and sell lamps on Etsy and craft fairs lol",

I scour the stl sites daily and am always saving things to print at a later time, both fun and functional. Some I keep, some I give to family, some to peeps at work id=f I know they have an interest in something specific. I also picked up a new hobby, book nooks, so I'll get a print started and am satisfied it's running well, then go work on a nook. I also work FT, but I'm wfh 4 days a week so I can also run prints during the week. It's a habit, for sure!",
