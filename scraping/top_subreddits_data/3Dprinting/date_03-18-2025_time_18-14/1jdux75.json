It'll also read fault codes out of things like the ABS module that 'normal' scanners/apps can't or won't find. You don't get any long coding, and options for other modules is limited/non-existant (like if you buy an RCD330 and have a 'fancy' factory sound system with amplifier, you can't re-code that amplifier to tell it the radio is sending a different signal, you still need VCDS for that), but for a solid 85% of owners it's more than sufficient.",

At $3.50 a gallon and 15,000 miles a year, it would take 6.6 years on fuel savings alone to earn back the premium for a hybrid that gets 35 mpg and costs $4,000 more than a gas-only car that gets 25 mpg.\n\nhttps://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/the-real-costs-of-owning-a-hybrid.html#:\\~:text=At%20%243.50%20a%20gallon%20and,car%20that%20gets%2025%20mpg.\n\n[https://www.calculator.net/fuel-cost-calculator.html?tripdistance=14000&tripdistanceunit=miles&fuelefficiency=50&fuelefficiencyunit=mpg&gasprice=3&gaspriceunit=gallon&x=Calculate](https://www.calculator.net/fuel-cost-calculator.html?tripdistance=14000&tripdistanceunit=miles&fuelefficiency=50&fuelefficiencyunit=mpg&gasprice=3&gaspriceunit=gallon&x=Calculate)\n\nTheres an example above. And you don't need sources (for the most part) if you can do basic calculations with gas prices in your area and distances driven with prices of hybrid/non-hybrid cars of the same make. You can easily estimate when you will break even and or be cheaper than repair costs.\n\nObviously, if a person does not drive much, the savings will be negligible and its better to just get the cheaper car. ymmv",

It\u2019s not true that the alternator only charges over 14v. A low battery is usually something like 11.5v at idle, while it will be more like 12.1-12.4V on a high charge when the engine is off. The battery does not rapidly discharge in the cold. It takes quite a while of parasitic drain to lower it significantly, and once that happens the engine turns back on again before the battery gets too low.\n\nStart stop systems also monitor the engine temperature and won\u2019t work if the engine is cold. It takes MUCH less energy and fuel to start a warm engine than a cold one, because the stoichiometric ratio required is much leaner.\n\nFinally, LED lights use virtually no energy. The heat for the cabin comes from residual heat from the radiator, the car is just running a fan because your engine is already hot. Very little is being drawn from the battery",
