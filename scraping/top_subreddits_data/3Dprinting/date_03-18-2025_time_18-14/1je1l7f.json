Would this cost work for you?\n\nThere will also be discounts (black Friday, early-bird price, etc.), so you might get the app cheaper.\n\nNote: the prices might change, as the release will be likely in September, and now we only do community testing with the first prototype",

The plugin will be compatible with an LTS version of Blender and both of these might be downloaded and used offline, or saved locally on a hard drive and be put on a shelf to be reused years later. So unless your computer doesn't support one of the next Blender LTS releases (now it's 4.2LTS I believe), you're good to go, and you'll always be able to export any broken parts from your car again.\n\nWe're thinking about step 2, as not everyone can use full 3D software to export a car, so we'd like to streamline it later and make it more widely available through an online experience, with nice features, like car design sharing among friends, etc.",

I could see RC enthusiasts spending that kind of money. \n\nWould you be open to selling the app on its own, and people can manufacture/procure parts at their discretion?  I feel like you\u2019d get a lot more business by just selling the software and allowing hobbyists to print their own cars. Or perhaps you could sell the guts of the car for cheaper, people can print their own shells. Just some ideas.",

You can edit it, then export the printing data from it and get them nicely sorted in folders. We do nothing physical in the process.\n\nThe rest is your job - printing, assembly, deciding on getting the electronics in there, optionally getting the electronics from any store, and making it work. We'll provide a manual and a list of recommended non-printable parts, but it's up to you to get them.\n\nEdit: If you're asking for community cars/parts, that's something we have in mind, but the engineering is quite hard and it needs a lot of testing, which is why we include our models, which we know will work together no matter the user combination used.",
