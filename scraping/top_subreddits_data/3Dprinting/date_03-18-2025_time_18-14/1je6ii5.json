    "selftext": "Needed some branded shirts for an event of my company, but all online printers would have taken too long to deliver the shirts. So I bought fabric paint, 3D printed this stamp and made the shirts myself over the weekend \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWith the help of the ring I was able to apply color multiple times to get a nice result. Under the ring there's a round piece of plastic, so that the fabric is fixed in place. ",
