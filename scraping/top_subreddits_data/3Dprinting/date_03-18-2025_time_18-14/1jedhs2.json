With a model like this I'd optimize for.... Looking good\n\nEdit: Sorry. Took the opportunity to sass you without offering actual advice which is something I try to avoid doing in general so I wanted to fix it.\n\nFor all the figurines that I've printed I've found that vertical or slightly angled works best.  For this one I'd probably just have gone with it standing on its feet and used tree supports.  What I've done in the past is start by letting it auto-generate supports and then start going in and paint out the ones that are clearly unnecessary until I'm happy with what I've got.  Putting this thing on a bit of an angle might work, but you'd probably be sacrificing a nice flat surface on the bottom of the feet which is going to be important unless you decide to add a plinth.  If you add some kind of flat surface beneath the feet then you could angle this model 35 degrees or so and probably improve the strength of some areas but it'll also probably give marginally worse print quality.",

You can change your support settings after orienting the part, so it has no idea what would be best.\n\nOf course printing with the flattest side down will use less support, but if it's not perfectly flat that whole side is going to have a thin bed of support that's possibly even stronger than normal since it sits at basically the same temp as the bed for the entire print. If you orient it standing up or some other more vertical position you'll minimize the total area that the support is touching the model, meaning bigger chunks wasted but they'll each come away more easily",

Only the interface layer will be different.\n\nThey won't merge completely at the interface layer, and you can separate that incredibly easily.
