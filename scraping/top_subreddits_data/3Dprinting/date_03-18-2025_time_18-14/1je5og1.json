    "selftext": "I made a foot stand/foot rest for a baby high chair. The high chair I've got is the ANTILOP from IKEA, so I designed the foot stand around it, but the model could be easily adapted to other chairs. In my experience it's the most common high chair I've seen in restaurants.\n\nThe model prints in two different plates, one with the actual foot stand and one with all the assembly elements. No external parts or tools are required for the assembly.\n\nThe actual foot stand is composed of two pieces that fit and slide inside one another. This allows you to set up whichever height you want and always have a continuous foot stand. The stand clips into two lateral rings with dove tails: make sure you assemble it with the foot stand sliding from the top to the bottom, so that it won't come out on its own. You may use glue to fix it permanently, but I like to have it in different parts so that if something breaks it's easier to repair without having to print the entire model from scratch.",
