If there are gaps or missing parts them\nFile\\Export\\Object file\n\nOpen in Fusion and select body on the toolbar then the yellow triangle. \nStitch and fix\\OK\n\nThen in Fusion\nFile\\3D print\n\nYou then have an STL. There are other things you can do such as preferences in LDraw to have higher resolution parts and in Fusion you can wrap instead of stitch.\n\nThe advantage of this way is you can edit any parts that may not immediately work in Fusion360 after converting to body. You can also seperate parts in the slicer if it's a whole body such as a rod/arm/spring suspension (which I just made actually).",
