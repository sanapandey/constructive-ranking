For example, Canada has to be skill based. Do you mention that anywhere? No. Are you mentioning ARV/Prize Value? No. You're not disclosing who the administrator of the giveaway is, that's a violation of multiple state laws.\n\nFor Sweepstakes, there's a whole series of things you need to do and I very much suggest you asking your legal council to advise you.\n\nThats not to mention the lack of a privacy policy.",
