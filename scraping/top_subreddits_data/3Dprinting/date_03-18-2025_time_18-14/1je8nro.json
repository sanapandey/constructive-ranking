    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm happy to finally show you what I was planning on doing for nearly 2 years. **Oddish planter**. For sure the biggest print I printed and modeled myself. Took me some time but he is alive and I couldn't be happier with it. It is printable without AMS, so more of you can enjoy it. Also it is faster and more reliable. \n\nIf someone likes it, you can get model here: [Oddish planter](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1219924-oddish-planter#profileId-1236573)\n\n",
