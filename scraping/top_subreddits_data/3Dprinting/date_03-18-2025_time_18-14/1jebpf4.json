I built a \"wallbot\" inspired thing a few years back with the steppers and control board fixed to the wall and your presentation here makes that seem like a super obvious mistake!  \n  \nOut of curiosity, did you consider using [https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC) for the firmware? It runs on the ESP32, has built-in support for [wallbot kinematics](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/config/kinematics) and a webUI.",
