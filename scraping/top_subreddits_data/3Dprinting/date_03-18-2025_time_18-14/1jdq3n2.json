In reality him and Russell T Davies did not get along at all, that was basically it.\n\nHe's even on record said \"Sack Russell T Davies and I'll come back\".\n\nIt's fairly well known that Davies treated Ecclestone and the rest of the cast in season 1 badly.\n\nJust for some context of how much the BBC wanted to position it as Ecclestone being the problem, they blacklisted him for years after he left and thats one of the reason's he's been so against returning. \n\nTo be clear he's absolutely fine with the cast. He attended MCM several years ago along with Tennant, Piper and Smith and they all chattted, hugged and were on great terms. I was there and they were litterally just standing around amongst everyone chatting, laughing, etc. He had time for everyone there, posed for photos etc and was absolutely great.",
