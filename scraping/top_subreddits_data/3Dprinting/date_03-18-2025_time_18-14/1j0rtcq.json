    "selftext": " Welcome back to another purchase megathread!\n\nThis thread is meant to conglomerate purchase advice for both newcomers and people looking for additional machines. Keeping this discussion to one thread means less searching should anyone have questions that may already have been answered here, as well as more visibility to inquiries in general, as comments made here will be visible for the entire month stuck to the top of the sub, and then added to the Purchase Advice Collection (Reddit Collections are still broken on mobile view, enable \"view in desktop mode\").\n\n**Please be sure to skim through this thread** for posts with similar requirements to your own first, as recommendations relevant to your situation may have already been posted, and may even include answers to follow up questions you might have wished to ask. \n\nIf you are new to 3D printing, and are unsure of what to ask, try to include the following in your posts as a minimum:\n\n* Your budget, set at a numeric amount. Saying \"cheap,\" or \"money is not a problem\" is not an answer people can do much with. 3D printers can cost $100, they can cost $10,000,000, and anywhere in between. A rough idea of what you're looking for is essential to figuring out anything else.\n* Your country of residence.\n* If you are willing to build the printer from a kit, and what your level of experience is with electronic maintenance and construction if so.\n* What you wish to do with the printer.\n* Any extenuating circumstances that would restrict you from using machines that would otherwise fit your needs (limited space for the printer, enclosure requirement, must be purchased through educational intermediary, etc).\n\nWhile this is by no means an exhaustive list of what can be included in your posts, these questions should help paint enough of a picture to get started. Don't be afraid to ask more questions, and never worry about asking too many. The people posting in this thread are here because they want to give advice, and any questions you have answered may be useful to others later on, when they read through this thread looking for answers of their own. Everyone here was new once, so chances are whoever is replying to you has a good idea of how you feel currently.\n\nReddit User and Regular u/richie225 is also constantly maintaining his extensive **personal recommendations** list which is worth a read: [Generic FDM Printer recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/user/richie225/comments/1bh9jud/generic_hobbyist_fdm_printer_recommendations/).\n\nAdditionally, a quick word on print quality: Most FDM/FFF (that is, filament based) printers are capable of approximately the same tolerances and print appearance, as the biggest limiting factor is in the nature of extruded plastic. **Asking if a machine has \"good prints,\" or saying \"I don't expect the best quality for $xxx\" isn't actually relevant for the most part** with regards to these machines. Should you need additional detail and higher tolerances, you may want to explore SLA, DLP, and other photoresin options, as those *do* offer an increase in overall quality. If you are interested in resin machines, make sure you are aware of [how to use them safely](https://www.reddit.com/r/3DPrinting/wiki/resinprinting#wiki_safety). For these safety reasons we don't usually recommend a resin printer as someone's first printer.\n\nAs always, if you're a newcomer to this community, welcome. If you're a regular, welcome back.",

            "body": "Hi everyone, \n\nBeen driving myself crazy with research. My budget is ideally below $2000. Like the ability of multi material printing but not necessarily a deal breaker. The intent is to have it for dual purpose of hobby type stuff like figurines but also for more engineering grade materials as well. I work on cars a lot and would like to be able to print functional parts. Love the idea of printing in ultem or similar materials but doesn't seem possible in that price range. Willing to build a kit or mod an existing printer if possible \n\nMy current contenders \n\nBambu X1C: from what I've seen it looks super reliable, ams works great. Don't like the bed size is smaller than others, the whole cloud thing, and the hot end temp is below some others.\n\nCreality K2 plus: big size print volume, 350 C hotend, active chamber heater, multi material. Cons seem to be a lot of people question creality's build quality. \n\nQidi plus 4: build volume bigger than bambu but smaller than K2, 370c hotend, active heater, way cheaper than the K2 and X1C, but again build quality \n\nPrusa core one: has mmu, from what I read they are reliable. On paper it seems to have the lowest hot end temp so least material compatibility. \n\nElegoo centauri carbon: throwing this in here because if it can do 9/10's of the capability for a fraction of the price then why not. \n\nI know it's a lot, am I focusing on the wrong things? Looking forward to hearing your opinions. \n\nThank you",

Obviously they don't offer a larger printer at the moment, and who knows when the new one will be released or even sold in the US.\n\n  \nI've made vehicle specific reproduction parts, and upgrades/retrofits/fun stuff for the motorcycle and 4x4 communities (little stuff here and there).

ABS should be dialed. \n\n\\- X1C level tech/features/print quality\n\n\\- A multi filament system like the AMS but has a built in dryer, like anycubic.\n\n\\- Decent air filter system.

The fumes from the resin are bad to breath, so you don't want to be near it while it runs. Usually a garage or similar is where most people keep theirs.\n\nThe resins are cured by exposure to UV light, so sunlight from an open window could cause the resin to cure prematurely. You would need to be careful about how you handle your materials- It's easy enough not to keep resin just sitting around not in the printer or a bottle, but you would want to be quick when moving your prints from the printer to the wash step or else you'd have an extra layer on the outside making your prints look kinda gloopy. A lot of people work around this easily, but it's something to be be aware of.\n\nOpen windows also means less temp control. Resins work best at around 18-20C. Getting too cold especially makes them not cure correctly. Probably not a problem for most of the year in the Philippines, but maybe look into some kind of heater for the colder months of the year, like a fermentation belt for home brewing. They're relatively inexpensive compared to other heaters, can fit inside the printer around the print bed, and keep things around 25 C.",

I'm debating about buying a new printer.  \nI bought a Prusa Mini+ kit a few years back, had quite a few issues until I had figured out a working z-offset but after that the printing with PLA was rock solid. Then came the kids and the printer was abandoned for about two years.\n\nWhen I needed some brio/duplo adapters, I blew the dust off my printer and it worked like there had never been a break.\n\nBut now I need more and more functional stuff for outdoors, and printing in PETG is a real pain for me on the  Mini+. It's located in my basement, so temperatures can go down to 15 degrees celsius. It was way to much fiddling for me to have a halfway decent PETG print. The temperatures I ended up using were quite a bit off the manufacturers recommendations.\n\nSo, from what I read in the past years I wanted to go the Bambu route. No fiddling with the printer, just fire up the prints. I was on the edge of buying a P1S combo, which were quite cheap at the moment, when the whole Bambu gate went down. \n\nNow I'm thinking about a Prusa Core One. It's possible from a budget point of view, but maybe it's too much? I have two boys and am looking forward to print all kinds of stuff for toys, RC-cars, bicycles and so on. I just want reliable prints in materials other than PLA, like PETG and ABS. Even the occasional TPU might come in handy. Due to the printers location in the basement, I think I would benefit from a closed chamber even for PLA or PETG.\n\nBeing in Europe it would also be a plus for me, that Prusa is a Czech company.

I have been using my MK4S for mostly functional real world use prints that I design myself using parametric design software (OpenSCAD and FreeCAD) and have been impressed with the precision. From what I have gathered just reading forums on certain things I have tried to achieve, the MK4S is as accurate as they come in the sub \u20ac5000/ range. I print stuff with pcb screw hole mounts, water proof enclosures, pieces to replace broken household stuff like shelf and cable clips, a cover for an old LED light that had the cover broken, a tire for an RC car (both tread and hub) and am working on printing out a 6u 10\" server rack that only needs M6 screws and nuts to fasten together with.  \n\n\nI never used a 3d printer before this one so I expected to have a learning curve but it is honestly one of the easiest machines I have ever used. Assembly took a day but it was fun and afterwards I really can say with 100% confidence that I can repair or replace anything on it with ease besides the three pcb's. Even then you aren't permently married to that hardware and I have seen machines with totally custom firmware and hardware running on an MK4 chassis. Kinda cool. Can't do that with anyone else. \n\n\nIt is surprisingly fast, especially if you use a 0.6mm high flow nozzle on large objects that don't require any aesthetic detail. It is great at detail as well with a 0.4mm or 0.25mm nozzle. I have almost 2000 hours on mine already since the start of December and I have yet to run into any trouble whatsoever. I can't stress this enough, the only problems I ever have are user error which is why I chose it vs the core one that prusa just released. I wanted something that already had all the wrinkles ironed out and the core one was not it. The MK4s is exactly what I wanted in a 3dprinter. \n\n\nThe MK4s with enclosure kit bundle is \u20ac1129 with VAT or \u20ac948.74 without. The core one is cheaper and is core xy design, not a \"bed slinger\" like the mk4s. It is much louder however, but slightly cheaper. \u20ac1049 VAT or \u20ac881.51 without VAT. They both can be upgraded to use a multi material unit so if you ever want to do multi color or (my favourite) use PLA as the support interface for your complex PETG prints so that when you remove the supports there is no scarring of the plastic. Extremely useful upgrade that you can do later at any time. \n\n\nPeople balk at the price but I am convinced this thing will outlast me. It is the cheapest way to multi material print with a single extruder as well. The other methods all create twice as much waste.",

Larger prints being an option would be a huge plus, but if it increases the price significantly, then I can get creative.\n\nAuto-leveling is a must, and preferably it's accurate enough to be relied on for most usecases.\n\nLocal access is a must, I do not want to rely on a garbage cloud-based platform that may be unavailable at some point, nor do I want to be arbitrarily locked out of doing something just because the manufacturer doesn't like it (this pretty much excludes Bambu)\n\nAssembled is preferable, but I'm willing to build from a kit. I do have limited experience with assembling small electronics, but I don't think any kit requires board-level assembly, so we're probably fine.\n\nFinally, FDM only (if the above didn't already exclude resin) - I think resin is very cool, but I don't really have the space or ability to do the exhaust and I really do not want to end up like one of my coworkers who became very sensitive to resin fumes due to running the printer in their bedroom for several months/years.\n\nCurrent budget is a flexible 500CAD - higher is on the table if the difference is a significantly more reliable printer.\n\nAlso need to get filament. Not sure where is generally considered reliable, though I suspect most places are fine for most types (but it depends on the exact brand/label).\n\nFor what I've looked at:\n\nI've considered going for the Ender-3 V3, but from what I can find, it's a bit of a mixed bag for quality, though I'm not familiar enough to know if it's a small minority who are having issues or not.\n\nThere's the Bambu printers, but they are having their current issues.\n\nElegoo has the Centauri/Carbon, and the Neptune line, both are looking decent, though as far as I can tell, most are currently a mix of preorders, out of stock, or relatively new. Something from Elegoo is looking to be my best choice, potentially.\n\nAs much as I would like to go Prusa, they tend to be fairly high cost to get here (import fees are insane, which may be the case for a lot of the others too).",

The Centauri Carbon is already included in current Orca builds and some googling revealed that the kobra s1 has profiles out for it but may need to be manually imported.

Car Part Prototypes: Durable and heat-resistant parts for cars, which is a key factor.\n\nMy budget is between 500-700\u20ac, i want to have the ability to print multiple colours at once but not mandatory and im living in Germany.\nIm not sure if FDM or resin is the right answer as if I want the best of ABS, PC and PA for the car parts I still have to ventilate and find an enclosed space. Thats why im also considering Resin If there is the possibility to print with those materials. \n\nAre there also cheaper filament options that work well for those kind of tasks with more affordable printers?\n\nThank you for taking the time reading and thanks upfront for the advice.",

                    "body": "I think you want an FDM printer rather than resin. An FDM printer can print everything you wrote about and since your wargaming tabletop stuff is larger items an FDM would work great. \n\n\n\nI don't think resin printers can use ABS, PC or PA. Only FDM printers and only those with enclosures. They also need heat beds that can warm up to around 110 degrees Celsius and a hot end that can reach 300 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n\nYou can use any brand or quality of filament with any FDM printer, the quality of the filament is something that only matters when it matters, if that makes sense. If I am printing stuff to build a 10\" network rack, it is not going to matter if the filament doesn't lay down perfectly. If I get little bumps from water or extrusion issues it doesn't really affect my final product there. If I were printing a replacement flywheel for my car I would be a lot more diligent in ensuring the filament is good quality and prints perfectly. \n\n\nMy advice is to get a high quality FDM printer (my recommendation is the Prusa MK4s but the core one is an option too) and some cheaper filaments to practice with. Do NOT even try to print using PC and PA until you are comfortable printing in ABS/PETG/PLA. I say this only to save you a lot of money. You do not want to be tossing out 150 grams of PC or PA because you don't quite understand how to get things to adhere to the bed properly yet. Work on cheap filaments and print constantly and in a month or two jump to PC or PA. \n\n\nI pay $16CAD per kg of PETG. The cheapest PC filament I can get locally is $75 CAD per kg. \n\n\nFeel free to ask me anything if you have questions.",

I know the bambu comes with an exclosure standard, while for prusa it is an upgrade.  will i miss an enclosure if i start with an mk4 kit?",

I just can't decide what are the best options right now for FDM printing. \n\nMy info are: a budget that can reach 1000\u20ac, but I wouldn't mind going lower \ud83d\ude43; mainly looking for a corexy with an enclosure; it would be nice to have the possibility of multi color printing; I live in Italy, but from what I've seen there shouldn't be any problem to get any printer here; the use would be for cosplay, some toys and functional prints, so a bit of everything; I would prefer nothing less than ~250 mm of printing space, I know that for cosplay it would be recommended to get a bigger one but I can manage to print thing in divided parts. \n\nThere are 2 companies that don't inspire me too much, the first being prusa, because I think they are way overpriced for basically giving nothing more than the competition, and the other being Bambu, and that's because of the recent controversy, but I might still consider this last one because I don't think that locking me behind their slicer would impact a novice like me too much. \n\nThanks all in advance!",

But still, as I am looking for a corexy, prusa has only the coreone that costs more than I want to spend for just the printer. With the MMU it would be way above that. Also from what I saw, the multicolor systems could work for filament swaps if I use the same filament and one runs out during a print. It seems a nice addition in case I would need it. \nIt's just that I don't know what all my options are for what I'm looking for",

I was leaning towards the bambu P1P/P1S but have decided to stay away as I'm not fully understanding the potential drama/possible pay to play setup. I ordered the Elegoo Centauri Carbon, but won't receive it till June if the website is accurate. At that point, I'm sure we will be in full swing of swimming/summer activities so I know the novelty of the 3D printer will take a backseat until the fall. Because of this I'm leaning towards the Creality K1/K1C. Besides the smaller 220 vs 256mm size, I don't think I'm giving up anything else besides the price. The only other thing that is pushing me towards Creality K1 is the potential of going with the Coprint 3D product. I like the idea of a multi color system that retracts similiar to Prusa rather than pooping and wasting a bunch of product. Budget is up to $750. Would love to hear input on potential issues I may run into or if I should be looking into another printer altogether.",

Unless you know EXACTLY what you are looking for, getting both speed and quality out of an Ender 3 generally requires upgrades that are going to blow the costs of the printer itself out of the water. If you find one that is in functional order (make them at least start a benchy on it with you present) and running Klipper you might be in good shape, but it's still going to be rough at that price point.",

It's for school (high school so around 15 to 19yo), so printer that is easy to use, robust, spare parts availability.\n\nWhile thinking about it, you can suggest some crappy more expensive printer so the good one, whatever it's Pr\u016f\u0161a or other, wins.

I\u2019m primarily interested in printing tabletop minis, busts, figurines, and maybe some terrain pieces. I\u2019m not looking to tinker endlessly with settings or spend hours optimizing prints. I just want a printer that produces great end results without too much of a hassle.\n\nHere are my main considerations:\n\n* I\u2019m all about the final product. I appreciate when a printer simplifies the setup process with features like automatic leveling or easy calibration, so I can shorten the trial-and-error phase.\n* An ideal printer would work well with user-friendly wash and cure stations, without locking me into one specific brand for every part and consumable.\n* I\u2019m okay with paying a bit more upfront for some cool features, but I don\u2019t want to chain myself to one specific company.\n* My basement sits around 14\u00b0C/57\u00b0F. I\u2019m not keen on DIY heating solutions (no heating belts or makeshift air heaters for me). A printer that handles the temperature control is a must.\n* I\u2019m not a handyman. Things like replacing the screen should be straightforward, so I don\u2019t have to worry about complicated fixes.\n* I want to use standard resin for great-looking minis. Ultra-mega-high resolution isn\u2019t a must, just reliably good results. Print speed is less important that quality.\n* Built-in cameras, WiFi, or fancy apps aren\u2019t necessary for my setup, especially since my basement has terrible reception.\n\nOne last thing: with new printers coming out so frequently, is it smarter to dive in now with a solid, proven model, or should I wait a few months for the latest tech to hit the market?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any recommendations or insights based on your experiences.

In the process of starting up a business, making bracelets/collars with little beads of varying sizes. It would be a mix of regular beads, but mainly would need the printer to make beads with various letters on them (I'll include an example photo below.) \n\nI am completely new to 3D printing, so I have no idea what kind of printer would be best for the job, what material would be best to use, or how to operate one. I know the learning curve might be big, but I'm willing to take the time to learn everything. My budget at the moment for a printer is \u00a3300, but if you think a more expensive model would be more appropriate, I am open to suggestions.\n\nThe other question is should I outsource the printing to companies that offer the services? I assume getting my own printer would be the best way to go about operating the business. Considering the need to be able to customise the size of the beads, and as I become more knowledgeable, I would also like to add more customisation options, I assume having my own printer would be the best option?

            "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI got into 3d printing in late 2017 when I build myself a Hypercube Evolution. I made countless modifications and improvements to it and also started building a second printer, an aluminum extrusion ultimaker clone, which I never finished building. Eventually I got busy with life and other things and haven't touched the printers since late 2020. Both aren't working and I don't even know what I was doing last with it or what I wanted to do.\n\nBut I'd like to get back into 3d printing but I have no idea how things have changed in the last years. I want to buy an off-the-shelf printer that just works without too much work and gives at least decent results. Afterwards I might get my old DIY printers back running again. So I'm looking for some guidance how the printer world in 2025 looks like. Ender 3 still the go-to for low budget printer? Prusa high quality?\n\nI prefer not to spend over 500\u20ac and don't need multicolor system. The main purpose is to print \"engineering\" parts like mounts on a drone, tablet holder for a tractor, parts for the 3d printers. Don't really plan on printing art/figures etc. Main materials are PLA and PETG but I like to try ASA, TPU and CF-materials. I'm fine with trouble shooting, upgrading, soldering etc. A kit is also fine. No Bambu tho. 300x300 might be nice, but not necessary because my Hypercube when working again could take care of any bigger parts.\n\nCouple questions:\n\n1. Any downsides with bed pushers compared to CoreXY or other \"box\" printers?\n2. Between Creality K1C, Anycubic Cobra S1, Elegoo Centauri Carbon and FlashForge Adventurer 5M, which is the best?\n3. Which filament brands are the go-to at the moment?\n4. I used CURA slicer in the past, what's today's slicer of choice?",

As for your questions, Prusa has high-quality and reliable machines, although the only printer that Prusa has within your budget is 180x180mm. Downsides for bed slingers are mostly that they are slower, and cannot print advanced materials such as nylon and ABS. Some filament brands that are popular right now are esun and sunlu, for cheap filament, ad elegoo, for slightly more expensive but also better quality. The most popular slicer right now is definitely OrcaSlicer.",

Right now I have a Monoprice Maker Select Plus in an enclosure that\u2019s old as hell and modded so it\u2019s useful, and a Prusa Mini+ I inherited. I just moved, which meant taking the MMSP slightly apart, and the enclosure was damaged in the move. I don\u2019t feel like reprinting all the parts for the enclosure to fix it, and I think it\u2019s time to upgrade to something that can eventually do multi-filament printing.\n\nThe top two candidates are the Prusa Core One and the Bambu X1C. I like the Prusa because it\u2019s more mod friendly and I\u2019m used to having to do that. I like the Bambu because it looks more like an appliance that I don\u2019t HAVE to mod to make it useful. My general budget is about $1,600, and I can always add the multi-filament attachment later on if it\u2019s too expensive. What\u2019s the general consensus these days?",

I don't want a cheap one that is low quality and won't do what I want, nor do I have the funds for a $10m one. \n\nAs for building the printer from a kit, possibly Im good at stuff like that but I don't have much electronic maintenance experience. Not sure how to solder a board, or any of that. Yet. \n\nI want to make cool nick nacks, and possibly large display objects. Pretty much I want to make a small business out of it and make stuff. If I can incorporate this with wood-working that would be awesome too since I want to start making stuff from wood as well.",

If you're looking for really fast prints your best bet is to print with a bigger nozzle and with larger layer height. I don't know if that's appropriate for your needs but it's worth a try. \n\nThe major downsides on any printer now usually comes down to convenience and accessibility features like network printing or not great firmware like auto z offset not working consistently.

I think that a lot of bang for the buck and an offer one could take. But I read reports of quality problems with both Anycubic and the Kobra 3. Warped bed, leaking nozzle leading to blob of doom, bug in the implementation of the z-offset and things likt that.\n\nHe is new to 3d printing but very capable in DIY and has a background in electronics. So some troubleshooting will be okay, but only chasing problems will probably take the fun out of the new hobby.\n\nSo what do you think, have the teething issues with this printer been resolved?\n\nWhich other printers could you recommend on a more budget level (250-450\u20ac). Bedslinger is okay, doesn't need an enclosure, AMS would be nice, should be easy to operate for beginners.",

Of course, I'm still in the \"I don't know what I don't know\" phase of 3d printing and I'm wondering if there are any features it doesn't have that I may want to investigate before making the purchase.",

I know 3d printing has come a long way since I bought my existing printer, and frankly the amount of options is staggering. I'm willing to go up to like $1000 if I can get something good that'll keep working for a long time, but I'm fully open to something cheaper that may suit my needs best.\n\nI've only printed PLA on my existing printer, but I would like to check out stuff like TPU and the rest of the wide array of modern materials. 90% of what I've printed up until now is just little models and figures, mostly for gaming terrain. So far what's caught my eye has been the Prusa MK4S, and the Qidi Q1 Pro. I really like Prusa's open approach, although the cost is a bit high. I'm open to any other suggestions, as frankly I don't really know what's out there anymore.",

My budget isn't much which is why these are all sub $200 except for one lol.\n\nThat begs another question: which has the most free, cheap (perhaps not a subscription based thing -- as you never actually own it) software available for it? I have seen some software... yeeesh $$$$$",

Me and my wife have agreed as a celebration for myself I can blow my first paycheck. I'm thinking about getting a 3D printer. The check should be around $1300. I would prefer not to suspend the entire check on just the printer.\n\nWhen I did some quick searching I saw some for around $300 and was hoping those would do what I want. I live in the USA. I should be able to build my own kit. (I work in maintenance and helped build a couple computers when I was a kid) Sadly we currently live in a one bedroom apartment with only one location where I can probably put the printer right now. It is probably 2 feet by 4 feet, but by the end of the year we should have a house and I could probably put it wherever I want. So If space is too limiting I can just wait and purchase it then.\n\nI would also really want it to print in multiple colors. I'm not that much of a painter. I play D&D and know I will probably be printing minis out. I'm also the kind of guy who likes to be efficient with things, and will probably use it to print out things for around the house to help me make it more efficient. I also want one that I know will last. When I brought it up to my wife one of her first comments was when we have kids she might use it to print out educational materials for kids. But that is multiple years away and want it to last till then. What kind of printer can I get for that? What kind of things should I be looking at? What kind of filament or necessary accessories is needed?\n\nPlease tell me anything I didn't think to ask. Just want some help.\n\nThanks",

Only thing that I can say is that before you buy a printer, make sure to look at reviews. Some printer's look great, and are cheap, but break down fast and need to be modded. As far as other accessories, you might need sandpaper or files, but I cannot think of anything else. Hope this helps!",

I would be careful about battery life estimates as they are usually manipulated, try to find reviews of your exact laptop to find real-world battery results. Other than that the soldered ram is a concern for upgradability but if you don't care about that it seems to be a solid option.
