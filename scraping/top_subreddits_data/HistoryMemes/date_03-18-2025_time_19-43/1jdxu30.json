Estimates vary as to how many were killed. Between 1936 and 1945, roughly 14,000 victims were murdered in Unit 731. It is estimated that at least 200,000 individuals have died due to infectious illnesses caused by the activities of Unit 731 and its affiliated research facilities.*\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731",
