The Bay of Pigs invasion as originally drawn up would have devastated the Cuban military and it's very likely the US would have captured the island before the Soviets could get a reasonable force of naval or air assets anywhere close to Cuba. Plans were to basically bring an entire carrier strike group down on Cuba to destroy their major airfields and shoot down any aircraft they could find, then paratroopers would be dropped behind the beach head so that cubans defending the amphibious landing had to fight in all directions, and the original plan also intended a different, more defensible position for the landing.\n\nIt was only when the US withdrew basically anything that tied the invasion to the US that it was doomed to fail. The Cuban air force was still intact and disrupted landing operations, there was a significantly smaller force of troops that were quickly overwhelmed, and the alternative location chosen was about one of the least defensible beach heads on the entire set of Cuba.",
