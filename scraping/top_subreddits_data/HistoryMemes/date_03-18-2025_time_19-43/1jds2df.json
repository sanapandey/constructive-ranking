I try to follow the guidelines expressed in the [Nine Noble Virtues](https://friggasweb.org/nvirtues.html) (the link is \"for kids,\" but if a kid can understand it, so can an adult).  Occasionally I am able to participate in bl\u00f3ts and sumbl, these being the only times I (personally) drink alcohol.\n\nSeeing how my Patreon, Ska\u00f0i, went toe to toe with \u00d3\u00f0inn and \u00d3\u00f0inn, and they backed down, I'm not stupid enough to bug her with prayer.\n\nI'm not currently under any group, but consider myself to be under the \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0.  I would join, but they require Icelandic citizenship.  \n\nIt's been locked, but /r/asatru has a lot of good material.  Don't forget the joke is that it is \"the only religion with homework\"\n\nSide note.  Google translates \"\u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0\" as \"The Ascetic Society\".  A definition of \"Ascetic\" is \"the science which treats of the practice of the theological and moral virtues, and the counsels of perfection.\"  It is important to be in a continuous state of learning, in order to strive for the unachievable goal of perfection.\n\nRAH mentioned this in *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*: \"But being rational, he knows that not all individuals hold his evaluations, so he tries to live perfectly in an imperfect world\u2026aware that his effort will be less than perfect yet undismayed by self-knowledge of self-failure.>\n\nAnd speaking of Rah, his latter book, *Job: A Comedy of Justice* was my introduction to the Gods, which I understand is unusual in comparison to the normal (Marvel) path.",

Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements or avocations. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society. For example, stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication; as of 2024, video games became more popular following technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time.\n\nThere are various types of hobbies, which can be classified in various ways, including subject matter, degree of time commitment, and social versus solitary nature. The Serious Leisure Perspective of Robert Stebbins identifies hobbies under three sub-categories: casual leisure, which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation; serious leisure, which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment; and finally project-based leisure, which is a short-term, often one-off, project that is rewarding.",

A Russian who lives in Asia does not share the same identity with a Vietnamese. It is a misnomer to refer to Russian settlers in Asia as if they were in the same group as the Chinese. As if Russian achievements made in Asia are somehow \"Asian\" achievements. Or as if Chinese achievements are the achievements of everyone who lives in Asia. Because that's what's done when people like Cleopatra are called African, they are deemed as somehow the legacy of African-Americans.\n\n\nOr, going closer to the US, thinking that I as a Latin American am in the same group as the US and Canada just because we are in the same \"continent\" (depends on how you count them). The US and Canad\u00e1 are nations closer to Europe than they are to us, I would be delusional if I thought of them as sibling nations like I do M\u00e9xico, Bol\u00edvia and Costa Rica etc.",

Maybe a few hiccups here and there but nothing serious enough to reverse their hegemony of the Middle East. I will mention the Byzantines losing Constantinople is what lead to the Renaisance  as it in turn was because of displaced Byzantines who retreated from Constantinople. Id argue Byzantium would last for a good while before the next Renaissance actually occurs. The Coptics no doubt will be relevant again.\n\nAh, but if Songhai ever managed to get their hands on a craftsman for guns in the 1st place, its likely  Outremer would have already had them 1st. Bonus Points if there from China (or at least Mongolia when China was ruled by the Mongols) were the knowledge of gunpowder would be more easily spread from an exiled chinese war engineer or something along those lines.\n\nI know for a fact that due to the increased unity of the Christians, the Mongols will be hard pressed to advance West if the Pope decides to make Genghis the new Crusade Target. Even worse if its the Successor States like the GH and Ilkhanate since it becomes a matter of Divide and Conquer. This may also lead to increase interactions with India and China, with Outremer as the buffer between them and Europe. Provided its the right era like when the Mongols temporarily took over China.\n\nThe Crusaders might even have renewed vigor and more zealous if Outremer is spearheading it. Being the defacto Crusader State. And thanks to the introduction of Guns from either a Chinese or Mongolian War Engineer/General, they might be ahead of the curve than even the recovering Morrocans.

They bounced back after the Mongol Raid on their Stronghold? Or at least the Pope managed to get all of Europe to rally once more against the Mongols. You also have to consider a situation where something similar happens post Genghis/Mongol.\n\nWhere do the Templars go from there? Provided they at least bounced back because of the sheer amount of money they made (they aren\u2019t as controversial as the Assasins imo) if not because the hatred for them hasn\u2019t simmered yet or really boiled over.",

The knights Templars and its members would have acquired a massive amount of land and estates in the Outreamer as well as Europe via branches\n\nA lot of those branches in Europe would be seized or closed or rebranded in the aftermath of mongol invasion as Kings and nobility want to clear their debts. Leading to the decline of the Templars in Europe\n\nThe weakness of the Templars also means their trading monopoly on the Nile would get broken by the kings of the Outreamer, who would regularly find the Grand Master of the Templars to be a political rival more than anything else \n\nThe organisation would still own a massive amount of land and property in Egypt, Syria and the Levant but it would have been heavily siphoned off by its membership\n\nIt ironically makes it double down on the banking business in the 1400s, which then gets eclipsed by  or even absorbed into the new Central Bank of Egypt later",
