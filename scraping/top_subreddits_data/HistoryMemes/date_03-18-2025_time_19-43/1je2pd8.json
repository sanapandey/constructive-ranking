He was far from a democratic leader, and passed several acts to completely dissolve the Iranian legislature and shut down opposition. He also postponed elections. Technically speaking, he was the one conducting a coup while the shah legally had the power to remove him. (Whether it\u2019s a justified coup is a different question)\n\nIf the west stayed out of it, it could go several ways:\n\n-Iran turning into Venezuela (oil is nationalized, but used in a populist way that eventually leads to economic collapse) \n\n-Mossadegh being deposed by internal factions. The shah was still the formal head of state, and wanted power for himself. Mossadegh made a lot of enemies within his nation, and was by no means liked by most people of power within Iran.\n\nNevertheless, these options may likely still be better than the ending result which is modern Iran.",

I got it as him circumnavigating the Senate, which was by half appointed by the Shah, and basically a club of aristocrats. This Senate was deeply opposed to the anti British/US policies of Mossadegh. And that lead to the constitutional crisis if you want to name it like that. To be completely honest: it doesnt strike me as very democratic, when a senate composed of aristocrats that were appointed by a monarch can hold the elected government hostage and block their policies. \nI know that this may be an oversimplification of what happened, but I just wanted to put it into perspective. \n\nCertainly what the US/Britain/France and others did with Iran is what happened all over the Islamic world: Prop up a regime that cracks down hard on any leftist opposition or tendencies. And that they did. The intellectuals of the opposition left the countries because of that persecution. And later they wondered how the only real opposition that was left is a religious one...",
