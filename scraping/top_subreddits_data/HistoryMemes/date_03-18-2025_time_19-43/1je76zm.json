So 1085\\~ years, or 1059 years officially.\n\nPS; First capital of Poland was **Gniezno** which super close to Polish word **Gniazdo**(nest). According to legend recorded on paper in 13th century, legendary ruler Lech stopped at future Gniezno location after he saw a nest of White Eagle at red sky sundown/sunset (Modern CoA of Poland). Dynasty which founded Poland was **Piast**'s which word's core comes from the word 'pica' meaning food/feed/nourishment. From word Piast in Polish we have word e.g. Pie\u015bci\u0107 meaning; to fondle/make out/caress/pet/pettle/to feed sb(like a baby).\n\nedit: Poland, apart from invasions, was also colonized in 19th century and even before in 1500-1800 it was subject to crimean tatars' Slave Raids. It's estimated they enslaved 3.000.000 people from Poland/Lithuania/Russia and on average they captured into Yasyr/Jasyr (enslavement) 10.000 people annualy. Data from Dr. [Mikhail Kizilov](https://www.ushmm.org/research/about-the-mandel-center/all-fellows-and-scholars/2014-mikhail-kizilov)The word Slave was coined lit. after Slavs ie. inhabitans of slavic countries like Poland/Czechia/Croatia  \nSee above, why western leftism with western mindset & notions of post-colonial \"white man\", didn't win any election in Poland for the past 30 years.",

After which Russia liquidated any resemblance of Polish autonomy and begun to conduct national genocide on Poles nicknamed \"Russification\".\n\nso if sb sees Polish emigration as a problem then blame USA, RUSSIA and EU simultaneously.  \nLeave us in peace",
