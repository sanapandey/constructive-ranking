Its primary objective was achieving independence from the\u00a0Spanish Empire\u00a0through an\u00a0armed revolution. It was formed as a\u00a0secret society\u00a0before its eventual discovery by Spanish authorities in August 1896. This discovery led to the start of the\u00a0Philippine Revolution.\n\nThen there the KKK of America, and I feel like everyone know who those guys are or that they\u2019re easy to look up, that I don\u2019t need to explain it.",

They terrorized former slaves and did their best to halt deconstruction under the Grant administration he put a stop to the group by throwing all the members in jail (Paraphrasing here). Though racist they were a bit more borad it isnt till the second wave where they truly single in on black people \n\n[go to 19:18 for a slightly better dive on the KKK](https://youtu.be/tKA5YnxveXw?si=oR9gSnjUS0LvbIbv)\n\nThey had a resurgence during the Wilson administration 1913-1921 due to the film birth of a nation. The KKK's most famous elements such as the white hoods (stolen from Catholics) burning the cross and lynchings primarly against black people.\n\n But they simply fell off until the third wave which happened during the civil rights movements in the 60s and Continued until fully falling off 90s",
