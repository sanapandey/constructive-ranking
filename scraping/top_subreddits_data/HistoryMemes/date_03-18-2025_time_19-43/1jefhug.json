But swords were used by American officers who were equipped with revolvers up till and including the 1870\u2019s-early 1880\u2019s.\n\n\nOver all speaking hand cannons were the most revolutionary weapon of their time. Not for their accuracy or deadliness but frankly because it signaled the end of the armored era and end to the medieval era as well. For centuries countries kept on upgrading their armor to compete with each other and it began a multi century long armor race to see who could have the thickest and most unstoppable. Then came the mass equipment of crossbows that could pierce armor so that even increased the armor race even more drastically. \n\nBy the time hand cannons came into the field the end of the armor race and the start of the firearm race began. With a renewed focus on weaponry that frankly previously hit its peak several hundred years before and switched to primarily an armored focus. Which this also changed siege tactics drastically as well. With motte and Bailey and even castles becoming quickly obsolete the Introduction  to the polygon fortress was implemented across much of Europe. Which in itself up till napoleon was the new era of warfare. \n\nIn conclusion the introduction of the hand cannon to Europe at the end of the Hundred Years\u2019 War signaled the end of the medieval era. That was soon after marked by the new era of cannon pike and shot that ended up carrying well into the early 19th century some would say even later as in the Crimean war. It may not have been effective killing tool but it for sure ended the armor race that has been active in Europe for hundreds of years and started the firearm race .",

The mass armor race that had been on Europe for hundreds of years practically ended with the introduction of firearms to the European battlefield and it started a different arms race for firepower. \n\nThe motte and Bailey siege and defense tactics were practically thrown out within 100 years of the introduction of firearms to Europe and by the end of the byzantines in the mid 15th century the introduction to polygon fortifications began an engineering race across most of Europe that didn\u2019t end till the napoleonic era and some may say not entirely till the Crimean war around 40 years after Waterloo. \n\nThe meme isn\u2019t saying the hand cannon was the sole weapon of the time or whatever, it\u2019s pointing out just what I have said above. It may not have been effective, it may not have even been practical, but it sure couldn\u2019t have been stopped by armor alone without wasting way to much money in an attempt. Thus full suits of plate armor became chest plates.",
