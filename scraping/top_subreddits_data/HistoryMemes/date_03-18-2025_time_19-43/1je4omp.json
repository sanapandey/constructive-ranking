            "body": "Although he was merely the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt received a surprising (surprising to him even) amount of freedom in his endeavors. The Secretary of the Navy, John Davis Long, was frequently out of commission on health issues. Even when he was back in working order, he heaped off plenty of tasks to the eager Roosevelt. From July to late September of 1897, TR was acting Secretary on account of Long\u2019s wavering health keeping him away. \"Long is just a dear. He has wanted me to act entirely independently while he was away, and to decide all these things myself, even where I have written him that I was going to decide them in a way that I doubted whether he would altogether like.\"\n\nIn this capacity, Roosevelt now answered directly to President McKinley, who was far less hawkish. Over the course of that Summer, TR compiled a list of quotes from various prior Presidents, all of which pertains to the necessity of a strong navy. When published, most readers inferred that there was a rift between the Secretary and his more dovish superiors. For a time Roosevelt worried that McKinley would reprimand him for this, only for McKinley to say that he actually didn\u2019t have the time to read it. In the end though, McKinley did end up reading it over and endorsed Roosevelt\u2019s actions. \n\nSource: T.R., The Last Romantic, pages 312-314.",
