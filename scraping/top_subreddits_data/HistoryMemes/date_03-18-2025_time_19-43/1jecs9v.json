            "body": "Context: Erich Bauer was an officer who served in the S.S. and was responsible for numerous wartime atrocities, notably taking part in the Holocaust. Bauer was disliked even by his colleagues for his lack of discipline and boorish demeanor; he was an alcoholic who was described as being \"filthy and unkempt\". However, he was skilled at facilitating mass murders so he was quickly promoted up the Nazi hierarchy. His S.S. career started in 1940 when he was assigned to oversee prisoners as part of the T4 Euthanasia Program that murdered hundreds of thousands of disabled people across the Reich. Bauer wrote in his diary about how he would connect a gas pipe from his truck into the execution room and kill dozens of people at once.\n\nIn 1942 he was assigned to Sobibor Extermination Camp, where over 250,000 Jewish men, women and children were killed in the gas chambers. Bauer's job was to directly operate the chamber. For this he earned the affectionate nickname \"Gasmeister\" among the other S.S. officers. His reputation became even worse here; stories abound of him torturing, whipping and beating prisoners as they marched into the gas chambers.\n\nBauer managed to survive the war and went into hiding in Germany. In 1949, he was at a carnival in Kreuzberg when he suddenly came face to face with two of his former prisoners, Samuel Lerer and Esther Raab. He reportedly exclaimed to them \"how are you still alive?\" He was immediately arrested by authorities, tried, and sentenced to death for his role at Sobibor. Because the death penalty was abolished the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he died in Tegel Prison in 1980.",
