Not exactly idyllic living conditions.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, North America was seen as bustling and modern. There were cars, trains, subways, skyscrapers, highways, indoor electricity, 24/7 service, restaurants, indoor plumbing, etc. New York City and surrounding area was massive compared to anything in Europe at the time. You also get services that we take for granted now. Like having an ambulance or firefighters available in emergencies. Or, you know, COPS. Things that were lacking in mafia-controlled Sicily.\n\nEven a mid-city like Montreal (which has a large Italian community) would look like a significant improvement to many Italian places at the time. Montreal had about the same population as Rome, but unlike Rome, also had skyscrapers, cinemas, indoor plumbing, electricity, lots of personal ownership of vehicles, etc. This is Montreal in the 1920s.

Here is one that shows a more modern section of Palermo at the time - [Photo](https://www.prints-online.com/palermo-sicily-italy-crossroads-maqueda-7211885.html)). In this time frame, if you didn't have a pump in your home, you might be walking far away to get fresh water. Likely limited electricity available (Palermo may have had it, but certainly not in the countryside). You were likely not eating meat that often. No refrigeration. School - maybe you got up to grade 3? Laundry all being done by hand. No employment opportunities. No healthcare.",
