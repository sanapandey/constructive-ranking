A certain Saint Bridget made it known she had received bits of prepuce from an angel which she put on her tongue and gave her orgasmic-like sensations.\n\nDuring the middle ages, there were at least 14 claimants to the title of the Holy Prepuce in churches around Europe. In 1421, Henry V sent for one of them, the Holy Prepuce of Coulombs in France, because it was believed that its sweet scent would help his wife, Catherine of Valois, have an easy childbirth.\n\nBut maybe all of these many foreskins were phonies. In the 17th century Catholic scholar Leo Allatius suggested that Jesus\u2019s prepuce had ascended to Heaven at the same time as Christ and might have become the rings of Saturn.\u201d\n\nwww.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/28/religion.uk1\n\nReligious people are weird about sex organs.",
