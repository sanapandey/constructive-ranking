            "body": "The Emir of Afghanistan is Abdur Rahman Khan, also called the \u201cIron Emir\u201d who in my opinion would\u2019ve tried to become a conqueror if he didn\u2019t live in an era when his country was boxed in by Britain and Russia, instead he worked to consolidate his country into a more secure and uniform state including securing his borders and putting down rebellious factions, including people allied with some of his family members, of which he made towers of skulls like Timur did centuries earlier, and the Hazara ethnic minority, as well as converting the isolated pagan region of Kaffiristan to Islam and renaming it Nuristan (\u201cland of light\u201d in Persian)\n\nThe Russian conquest I\u2019m referring to is the Russians conquering the Teke tribe of southern Turkmenistan near the end of their conquest of Central Asia \n\nThe Central Asian warlord I\u2019m referring to is Yakub Beg, who is really the sort of character you\u2019d find in a much older era and seems like a man out of time. In his early life he was pretty unremarkable, just the son of a merchant in Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan but during the Duncan Revolt when various Muslim groups in western China rebelled he invaded and established his own Khanate called Yettishar in Xinjiang. The Qing were so slow at moving information and troops that he remained in power for thirteen years. He\u2019d die of either a stroke or poisoning and the Qing would reconquer his lands before any of his sons could take power \n\nThese just all seem like the kind of thing that would happen any time between like 1100 and 1600, it just seems too late to me to be doing all of this to me",
