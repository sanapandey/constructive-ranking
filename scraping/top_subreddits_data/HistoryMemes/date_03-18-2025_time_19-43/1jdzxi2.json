            "body": "In Hinduism, the term *deva* (\u0926\u0947\u0935) refers to gods such as Indra, Varuna, and Mitra, who are celestial beings associated with dharma (righteousness). In Zoroastrianism, however, *daeva* (\ud802\udf1b\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf09\ud802\udf2c\ud802\udf00) refers to malevolent entities that are followers of Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the principle of chaos and destruction. Conversely, Hinduism\u2019s *asuras* (\u0905\u0938\u0941\u0930), who are often in opposition to the devas, share a name with Zoroastrian *Ahuras*, divine beings associated with Ahura Mazda (the supreme god of Zoroastrianism).  \n\nBoth religions stem from a common Indo-Iranian religious tradition. When the proto-Indo-Iranians split into two groups (one moving into the Indian subcontinent and the other into Persia), their theological perspectives evolved in opposition to one another. As a result, divine beings revered by one group were demonized by the other, creating a mirrored cosmology where the sacred became the profane and vice versa.  \n\nReligious and cultural rivalry between early Vedic and Avestan societies may have reinforced this inversion, where each group cast the deities of the other as malevolent forces. Over time, these distinctions became deeply embedded in religious texts and traditions, shaping the way each faith viewed the supernatural realm and influencing their theological developments.",

What makes this conflict particularly interesting to me is that unlike Ragnarok or other apocalyptic stories, *the fight's already over* and the \"Heaven Gods\" won. The conflict is a story of the beginning of the world, or at least the beginning of Japan (the Imperial house has traditionally claimed to be the descendants of a \"Heaven God\"), not the end of it.",

There is Indo-European stuff of several rival divine or heroic clans (I'd say more than two, though one is usually markedly more chtonic and hostile to humans and other gods) - such as Aesir\\\\Vanir\\\\Jotnar in Norse mythology, Olympians\\\\Titans\\\\Giants in Hellenic, Tuatha De Dannan\\\\Fir Bolg\\\\Fomors in Irish. Deve\\\\Asura\\\\Rakshasa in Vedic-derived epics, etc. Though, the interactions between this clans were not always hostile, they traded and intermarried and, for example, Norse pantheon, included being of all \"clans\" - Aesir like Odin, Vanir like Freyr and Freya, and even Giants like Skadi. \n\nThen there is vaguely Fertile Crescent theme of generations of gods usurping or succeeding each other. Like primordial gods An, El-the-Fatherly or Tiamat giving way to Enlil, Baal or Marduk with their assosiated relatives and attendandts, sometimes violently. Hurrians had a three generation legend with Anu giving way to Kumarbi, giving way to Teshub.   \n  \nNow then it seems that Hurrians and Indo-European Hittites and Greeks, being in heavy contact with Fertile Crescent combined both motives  - rival clans and generations. \n\nI'd say it's more about organisation of societies. People model their pantheons on their societal structure themes, with more sedentary and irrigational societis having more organised and bureucratic divine courts, while those that lingered at \"tribal\"\\* stage having more volatile and warlike divine dynamics.\n\n\\*in brackets, because I do not like the stereotype that \"tribal\" or \"clannish\" societies are necessarily more primitive and simple than \"civilized\" ones",
