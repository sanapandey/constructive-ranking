    "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of debates on this subreddit about whether Ned Stark was truly an oathbreaker, but I feel like one key moment often gets overlooked. Right before his execution, he publicly declared Joffrey as the one true heir\u2014not because he believed it, but to protect his daughters.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I understand why he did it. He was trying to save Sansa and Arya, and it was the only way to possibly avoid execution. But at the end of the day, he still went against the truth, even if it was for the right reasons.\n\nSo I wanted to ask: did he break his oath to Robert?",

And Ned never got the chance to swear an oath to Stannis, even though he clearly thought Stannis was the true heir.\n\nSo while he might've broken his own code of ethics by publicly lying about the legitimacy of Joffrey's claim, I wouldn't say he broke an oath to anyone.",

            "body": "A lot of opinions about ned come from a misconception about what ned\u2019s moral/code really is. He isnt an angel, dude butchered men alongside rob and followed him loyally. Rob was not a gentle soul, he was basically a giant berserker who outright terrified his foes. They havent gone into much detail but im saying ned\u2019s code is largely about fealty and loyalty - with a greater thought towards responsibility to the realm. Ned is very textbook samurai. His men owe him complete loyalty and he in turn owes his king the same, and this is the way of the world so to ensure every man and woman in his realm are being \u201cserved\u201d as well as possible, these tensnts must be upheld. \n\nHe doesnt hate Jaime because jaime murdered his own king, he jist holds no respect or trust for him because he did it *only* when to ned, it appeared there was no personal risk and it was the safest course of action. You think Ned would hate Jaime if Jaime had said \u201cnahh bro\u201d and done him then before he could burn his dad or brother to death? When doing so woild haven been a desth sentence? Absolutely not, Ned understood there are some times an oath cant be upheld, and he likes to think he woildnt have chosen his own life over his honor were he in jaimes position, and he wouldnt habe hid behind \u201chonor\u201d as a kingsguard if he had failed to do so.\n\nYou got to understand why ned dislike the lannisters and particularly jaime. Jaime did nothing to help anyone, stood by protecting the mad king while he wrecked shit and murdered helpless people. That is the jaime he sees - someone who wants to look pretty in the shiny armor and win safely in the tourneys but completely empty of all the things Ned respects in a man. \n\nFor contrast he respected Selmy - despite selmy being in a similar position to jaime, he beliefes that Selmy *is* followong a code of honor and that he can be trusted. Selmy allowed the same king the same actions and opposed them during the rebellion, but he never pretended (so ned suspected of jaime) it was for any other reason than his sworn duty. Jaime conveniently only broke his oath when his death was otherwise assured - his job remember would literally have been to die fighting for his king as robert\u2019s men took the keep. But both himself and his daddy appeared yo switch sides right before theyd have to fight",
