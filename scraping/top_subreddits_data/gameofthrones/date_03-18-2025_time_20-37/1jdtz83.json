Maybe he thought it important he didn\u2019t bring swords along as a means to not expose what they were really doing. \n\nThis idea is harmed by the presence of practice swords. If you can bring those in without others noticing, then why couldn\u2019t you bring your real swords as well?\n\nBut I have always assumed, especially due to all of the points you are making here, there had to be a reason he didn\u2019t bring any real swords, and the most likely reason for that being to maintain the lie that she was simply attending dancing lessons.",
