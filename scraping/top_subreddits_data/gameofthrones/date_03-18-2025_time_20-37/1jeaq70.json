    "selftext": "A few weeks ago I made a talking about my general thoughts on seasons 1-3 as a first time watcher. I just finished season 4 so I figured it\u2019s a good time for a follow-up. (Note: lots of big things happening this season so this ended up being way longer than I expected, might have to do it more often than at the end of each season going forward)\n\nStarting off big, I knew Joffrey was poisoned and I knew Tyrion was blamed. I did not, however, know it was at his own wedding, nor that it was so early in the season. \n\nI was happy to see Arya get Needle back, and to see Polliver get his. And watching The Hound fight the whole band on his own was great. \n\nOberyn\u2019s introduction was good, love Pedro Pascal and I like that they wasted no time in setting up his eventual fight with The Mountain. \n\nThe development of Jaime and Tyrion\u2019s relationship was great. Jaime coming to visit him in prison, trying to get him a deal, them talking about how there\u2019s no word for killing your cousin, then finally helping him escape. \n\nSeeing the payoff of Jaime\u2019s new friendship with Brienne was so good and seeing her matched up with Podrick was so funny. \n\nPretty much everything with Daenerys has been great. Taking over and freeing the slave cities, and having to come to terms with the realities of ruling, that some of the freed slaves have spent too long as slaves to go back to freedom. And the scene of her locking the dragons up was somewhat surprisingly one of the more emotional moments in the series. \n\nI like Tommen so far, he seems a decent fellow. I\u2019m sure his reign will be long and peaceful. \n\nOne thing I was kind of mixed on was the stuff between Jaime and Cersei. The conflict between them and them being mad at each other but still trying to sabotage their perceived romantic rivals was fun, but pretty much everything after the wedding, less so. \n\nThe Siege of Castle Black might be even better than the Battle of the Blackwater. Grenn and his small band\u2019s last stand holding the gate against the giant is definitely a top moment of the season. I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting one of the giants to come out riding a mammoth. I love that one of the giants was using a massive bow, shooting arrows the size of fence posts, definitely should\u2019ve used that more. Jon going to negotiate with Mance was good. Stannis and co riding in was unabated but definitely a good way of making a battle that was clearly unwinnable for the Watch winnable. \n\nA probably unpopular opinion, episode 8 is bottom 3 episodes of the show so far. I haven\u2019t been overly fond of how they\u2019ve handled Theon\u2019s storyline and it was a big part of the episode. The stuff between Sansa and Littlefinger is weird (even if the testimony scene was a good character moment for her). And I didn\u2019t really care for the fight between Oberyn and the Mountain. \n\nArya and The Hound traveling together was great. I knew about his fight with Brienne but I didn\u2019t know who won. It was a great knockdown, drag out fight, and Arya\u2019s final moment with The Hound was fantastic. \n\nA positive across the board once again, is Tyrion. I was so glad to finally get to the trial. Obviously Tyrion\u2019s speech here is one of those clips that even people who haven\u2019t watched the show have seen and I\u2019ve very happy to see that it is even better in context. The \u201cthousand lying whores\u201d line certainly takes on a new meaning. Him having to send Shae away was one of the most emotional scenes of the show so far, then he had to kill her. This is the emotional effect I was expecting from The Red Wedding. And to follow that up, Tyrion confronts Tywin on the toilet. Sandwich a little comedy between the drama. Slipping Rains of Castamere into the score when he kills him is just the cherry on top of a great scene. \n\nThis season kinda lulled in the middle a little but it started and ended strong, like it more than Season 3, but I think 2 is still my favorite.
