She\u2019s loyal and he knew it and I mean letting your wife think you cheated on her is awful and it leaded to the fact that she always hated Jon, if she knew Jon would maybe know the love of a mother\u2026",

And I believe that person would've probably been her crazy sister, because Catlyn didn't even realise how crazy she was up until a point, so imagine Lysa having that information. With all Lysa's scheming, she would surely try to use that information to advance her family's standing because it would make her an aunt to the heir of iron throne, which could only work to her advantage. \nCatlyn made a vow to gods that she would love Jon as her own and wasnt able to uphold her promise, that's just the kind of person she was, she was always selfish and blinded by her own emotions, she is not to be trusted and Ned seemingly knew that, no matter how much he loved her. If she wasn't able to keep her promise to literal gods, she wouldn't have been able to keep a promise to a man either, even if that man was her beloved Ned.",

She couldn't help being an aggressive mother on behalf of her own brood.  Human or animal, mothers will do anything(!!) to protect their own children.  Ned could not take a chance, but--perhaps to compensate--he was was a conspicuously good husband to Cat.
