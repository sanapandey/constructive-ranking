            "body": "Neds support about killing Daenerys wouldn\u2019t change anything since Varys is the one who\u2019s really handling that situation. As for Cersei it depends, if Ned tells Robert before Robert goes hunting and Robert believes him then Robert kills Cersei, Jaime, probably the kids and possibly even Tyrion and Tywin. If Ned tells Robert after the hunting accident while Robert is on his death bed then it depends on who\u2019s informed. If Robert tells the kings guard and the small council then maybe they take control for Stannis but most likely there\u2019s still going to be war between Stannis and the Lannisters.",

When the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats? How does this influence the way it is received? Does Rob in rage go on to kill cersei and her children? And how does Casterly Rock or the troops at king's landing respond? How does littlefinger respond, etc. I think there's a crazy amount of story in there.",
