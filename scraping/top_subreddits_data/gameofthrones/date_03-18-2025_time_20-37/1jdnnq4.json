I always loved this scene because it also shows Tywin fishing which is a great foreshadowing to his brutality to the Tullys who's sigil is a **fish**.",

Thought it was kind of obvious how they portrayed it in the show, even though I hadn\u2019t read the books at that point. Although Charles Dance absolutely owned that scene I thought \u2018ok, so they\u2019re going to kill King Robert.\u2019\n\nBetter that they deleted this so we didn\u2019t have a clear sign he\u2019d gut House Tully, IMO.",

The scene where Ros leaves his quarters and he springs up and shows how spry he is was enough for me.\n\nOddly enough I also don\u2019t care for Tywin fishing, metaphor aside. It just seems too leisurely for his character.",
