    "selftext": "I think a great follow up and subject matter for Jon snow spinoff is Jon struggling with how to feel about Dany, decides to venture to find where her dragon took her. \n\nUnaware that she had been brought back to essos where another witch from the lord of light has brought her back from the dead. \n\nDany, now snapped from her \u201cmad queen\u201d spell, guilt stricken falls into a mental torture trying to live as an undead but plagued by her past. She sets off in her now unknown identity and fate into a world where she has no mandate but only a debt she can never settle, and the series follows her, him trying to find her, and their eventual reunion as we explore the world after the events of game of thrones. \n\n\n\u2014- end pitch. \n\nDo you guys like it? Have suggestions? How can this reach Kit or anyone who can consider this idea for the show? ",

I don't think there is a logical way of bringing her back in a case that it doesn't ruin the story.\n\n\n\nFrom what I've found, Resurrection gets old FAST in new movies and shows. More specifically, when it comes to the main characters. If we resurrected every dead main character that died, that'd ruin it. The plot and overall feel of the show, especially in this circumstance when its GRRM. An author who often kills fan favourites ( even though it wasn't GRRMs work.\n\n  \nI think this is just one of those unfortunate circumstances in which nothing can be done purely because of shit writing.",
