    "selftext": "Why did the Wildlings expect Jon to be fine with killing some random Horse Breeder? \n\nThis is a small little quirk that's bothered me for a while on rewatches. \n\nJon joins up with the wildlings, obviously as a spy, but Mance and a few others were at least partially convinced that he wanted to be free & join the side that would stand against the white walkers. \n\nNone of that has anything to do with arbitrary murder. \n\nTheir Warg posits a test, you're only one of us if you're willing to put a sword through the horse breeder's neck. \n\nOkay... why is that a valid test? Jon could 100% have been serious about joining them, but still not stomach the killing of innocent people, no? ",

To ensure Jon was 100% on board with them, it became necessary for Jon to do it. You see similar activity in criminal enterprises - they have potential associates or people who are on the fringe of their organization commit crimes in service of the organization to ensure that your future ('you' in this scenario being the person on the fringe) is inextricably tied to the future of the organization. You have everything to lose if they are found out. If Jon had killed the Horse-breeder, nothing he did afterwards would have mattered, he would be linked to the success of the Wildling invasion, as those in the North would know him as an oath-breaker and a murderer.",

            "body": "The Wildlings are hardened by years of living outside the law, constantly fighting for survival in a brutal world. For them, loyalty and trust are tied not just to shared goals, but to a shared willingness to do whatever it takes to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. The horse breeder test specifically is less about being okay with killing someone in cold blood and more about showing that Jon is willing to put aside the values of his old life. The Wildlings live in a world where survival is the priority, and that often means sacrificing individual morals for the greater good. It's a test to prove that Jon is not just pretending to be one of them, but that he has fully embraced the reality of their lifestyle. The Wildlings believe that someone who can\u2019t stomach that kind of violence isn\u2019t a true member of their group, regardless of how noble their intentions might be. They need to know Jon is willing to cross moral lines in a way that guarantees they can trust him to survive alongside them, no matter what.",

The smallfolk of the north shouldn\u2019t really mean much to him. I mean, yes, he should care about them in the abstract sense. But to actually put his life on the line to protect one right then at that moment? Think of it that way. We know jon to be honorable and a general stand up guy- but most of the people who live under lords in that kind of feudal society? At best you get a lord that treats you with general indifference. At worst a lord like the boltons, in which case their peasants are likely not having a great time at all. Lords like the starks are generally unheard of",

As if they truly cannot comprehend an individual being incapable of murder. \n\nI guess that's indeed what the show implies. Paints the wildlings and even Ygritte in a rather harsh light.\n\nBut hell, a few episodes later they raid an innocent village and literally eat a boy's parents. Then massacre Mole's town. \n\nI think I answered my own question here, frankly the wildlings had some great characters, I especially respect Mance. But overall, they're savage indeed.",
