    "selftext": "I think the Lannisters are all perfectly cast. Great actors who all seem perfect for their characters. The same with the Hound, Varys and Littlefinger. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else in their roles. Amazing casting. \n\nHowever I\u2019ve never found the actor that plays Jon Snow to be convincing or engaging. I think the casting team could have done better there. And the same with Daenerys and her circle of associates (excluding Ser Jorah who is excellent). I don\u2019t find the Dothraki to be particularly convincing or intimidating. ",

Getting the right faces/names for main adult roles was doable--Dance, Bean,Heady, Dinklage were known quantities who shone on screens AND brought in audiences.\n\nIMO casting the young had pitfalls. Jon and Dany, played by actors with \nformal training and a few impressive credits, were adequate young hero/lover archetypes.  But the biggest  challenge was the CHILDREN. The ability of untrained, inexperienced boys and girls to grow up over eight years into key young adult roles was unpredictable.  The actors of Joffrey, Arya, Sansa, \nBran, etc. had little to no experience or training. Yet Gold struck gold. They \ngrew up into believable older selves. That was a Gamble.  It paid off--Royally!",

            "body": "The vast majority of the actors were sensationally good, its part of why the show was so popular. Lena and Charles were the best cast Lannisters imo, both just stunningly good. Peter Dinklage was way too handsome to be Tyrion, but thats not really his fault, his actual acting was very very good. Olennas, Oberyns and Margearys actors were so good that they were much better than the book versions for me, which is unusual for any tv adaption of anything.\n\nAs for bad acting I have to agree with some other folks here about Jon Snow and Brans actors. Just not as great compared to the stellar performances of a lot of the other folks. I thought Emilia did pretty well, though I didnt watch season eight or much of season seven since it was already pretty bad and I knew it would get worse. Maybe her acting in those seasons was worse than what I saw but she was great in the Essos stuff imo.",

The same with the scene where Sam introduces Gilly to Jon and he\"s like: \" What are you doing?\"\nSam. This is Gilly!\nJon: Hi Gilly-, what are you doiny?'  It always makes me cackle how Kit delivers this line. \nI think Kit could have been perfect and did well with what he was given. If only he was given more lines and moments like book Jon I think it would be a perfect casting.",
