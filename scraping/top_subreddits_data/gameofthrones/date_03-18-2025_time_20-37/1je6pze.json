Then it would just be a Helen of Troy/Sparta story. \n\nI don't think the rebellion happens over Lyanna, that was just the last straw. I don't even think the Starks would wage a war over Lyannas kidnapping** alone. \n\nRobert might wage a war, but he would be lacking allies. Without the Vale/Riverlands he would get crushed. They all rallied behind Robert because of the Mad King's actions...if he isn't burning Lords alive in the throne room, then there isn't much reason for the other houses to rebel.",

Considering how the Northmen responded when Ned was killed, I absolutely think the rebellion would've progressed. Brandon was also known as a hothead, so Lyanna getting snatched and his dad getting burned would've definitely caused him to go full war mode imo.",

The OP asked \"What if Brandon had lived\" and \"Would Brandon have been a better lord\", so I assumed their father still died the same way, by the Mad King.",

If Brandon lives as a prisoner and Aerys still demands Neds head, Ned would probably heed Jon Arryns advise, which I think would be \"That fucking Targ WILL kill your brother right afterwards even if you do turn yourself over\". So, the Rebellion would still happen, but assuming Brandon lives to get freed by, say, Jamie, I think the Lannisters power could be greatly diminished because Brandon would most likely intevene against the Lannister troops, or perhaps even the mountain.\n\nSo overall, Brandon could die in a confrontation with the Mountain, or he could live to thwart Lannister meddling. And assuming Denys is canon in the show as well then maybe Ned gets married to Lysa instead of Jon but that's very unlikely.",

Let\u2019s assume Lyanna still dies in childbirth: It would seem like he murdered her or raped her which led to her death or he would have to declare that it was consensual, which the Northerners wouldn\u2019t really buy and majorly piss of the Dornish. He could end up with three kingdoms being hostile to him, although I doubt that the threshold for rebellion would be met if nothing additional happens but still: Difficult and tense times would be to come.\n\nJons, or to be more precise Aegons life would still not be easy. Many would regard him as a bastard because even if consensual they wouldn\u2019t accept Rhaegars marriage to Lyanna as legitimate, even tho few would dare to say that out loud. I could imagine him having a hard time at the red keep since Rhaegars advisors would see him as a diplomatic liability, souring relations with Dorne and the Stormlands.",
