Maybe Valyria just isn't as dangerous in the show universe as the books.\n\nAnother possibility is that certain sections of Valyria are more dangerous and they had a safer route, or that they just didn't happen to run into whatever harmed Balerion and infected Aerea. It's possible that it's specifically because they stuck to the waterways. I don't think those fire worms things that infected Aerea would be able to survive in waterlogged ground. Not hot enough.
