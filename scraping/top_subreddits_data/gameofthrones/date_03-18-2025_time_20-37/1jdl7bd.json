Sadly it came after a few nights of child sex abuse and I couldve done without that. \n\nJanos slynt? 10/10 would recommend beheading that POS again. But why did Jon have to be such a bitch about it? \n\nHigh Sparrow? Not even close I wanted to watch that mf squeal... dragon fire explosion was way too good for him. \n\nCersai and Jamie? Again they got a death that was way too good for them. Esp after how Jamie did brienne... I wouldve loved to watch cersais face as the last thing she saw was Arya skewer Jamie then turn the blade on her. \n\nStannis is a contender for me, he exhausted his resources and met a just end. \n\nTommen is also a contender for me. I love how that scene is shot with the blank stare at the window after he walks off, then he comes back and doesn't waste a second getting to business. Tommen was just nothing and his death felt equally dull. Also fitting he couldn't kill someone who imprisoned his wife, but the cowardice was strong enough to take his own life. Fitting.\n\nWalder and the fray gang probably have earned most pleasing death in my book. Just a bunch of peices of shit dying with the last stark standing over them. Glorious.\n\n*\"Ahhh yes, cheer.

Not many shows have the absolute brass balls to kill off it's main star, biggest name actor after one very successful season. I hadn't read the books yet at that time so this was impressive to me. Even today, after having read the books, I'm a bit surprised they didn't change the story to somehow save him, given the buzz it was getting all season long. They realized that these moments would come to define GoT, and it made you think that no character was safe.\n\nSo yeah, my favorite death not because I hated him, but because I loved him and it made me want to keep watching even more to see Joffrey's eventual comeuppance. \n\nHonestly I had kind of checked out by the time Danny got carried away to dragon heaven so it wasn't very impactful to me, and I never got very emotionally invested in her storyline on the show. Though her early seasons and especially coming out of the pyre unburnt were some of my favorite moments early on.",
