I've been jumping on this question for years now, and now that I'm watching HoTD, I had sudden urge to read the books. ",

You can do it, I guess, but I don't know why you would or if you would like it. Fire and Blood is better if you're invested in the world and the story through the series and then you want even more details. \n\nThe series is still worth it imo. It's my favorite fantasy book series ever. Even without a proper ending, the first three books are MASTERPIECES of fiction. And Feast and Dance are also excellent. George is a genius, at his best, and asoiaf is mostly him at his best. But that's up to you, if you can enjoy things as they are or if you'd prefer to spend time on a story with an ending.",

I would recommend reading Fire and Blood first since it explains some lore that might not be fully expanded upon in the main series. I will warn however that since it is styled as a history book it isn\u2019t for everyone.",

Actually helped me to understand better when characters in the main series talked or thought about historical events. I knew what they were talking about. \n\nAnd it's definitely worth it to read them whether the ending comes or not. The books are awesome. I've read them several times at this point and will no doubt continue to re read them.",

Attempting to read Fire and Blood first actually steered me away from reading ASOIAF for a while unfortunately. Eventually I picked up Game of Thrones and the rest was history. I completed the series (of the books that have been released of course) and went back to read Fire and Blood which was much more enjoyable that go around. \n\nIk it might seem daunting to read the series with no news of WoW being released, but in my opinion, this is the best epic fantasy series I\u2019ve read. I would highly recommend reading it bc each character is depicted differently than portrayed throughout the TV show and is overall very entertaining and extremely descriptive. \n\nI hope you choose to read the books and good luck with your endeavors!",

It\u2019s not written like a typical story; it\u2019s from the perspective of a maester (basically a professor in this universe) writing a textbook that spans over 100 years of cold, hard history. It\u2019s far from exciting. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d either read the books or watch the show first. See if you like it, and if you do, you can try F&B",
