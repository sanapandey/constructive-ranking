If their were organic planes used in medieval times, I'm sure they would have developed way earlier than 1470s",

We know little about the internal politics of the ancient Valyrian people, and perhaps they were just too arrogant to consider the possibility that a dragon rider might need to escape from a dragon that died mid-flight. After all, Valyria controlled all the dragons, so they wouldn't necessarily have worried about things like that.\n\nAs for post-Aegon I-to-Dance of Dragons-Westoros? Again, the Targaryens (and certain close allies like the Velaryons) controlled all the dragons. The possibility of inter-dragon warfare was definitely a consideration, but not enough to think of things like parachutes. \n\nRiders were also usually strapped to their saddles precisely to prevent them from falling off. It's why Aemond was caught off guard when Daemon unbuckled himself from his saddle and jumped on him to stab him; it just wasn't done. Until it was.\n\nAnd yes, things like Meraxes getting killed by a scorpion bolt did happen, but the Targaryens saw this as very much an exception, not the norm.",

In medieval times, it might be a theoretical material, but there isn't a lot there that can be used to reasonably carry with you without it being unwieldy . Given that modern parachutes use synthetic fibers while having modern techniques like lamination, alternatives are unlikely to be as effective given the volume needed for a parachute. Given the material used by the Wright brothers for their first aircraft due to the light weight (muslin) it may be possible, but you would need a relatively large layered amount before you do anything with it (unless you are trying to make a fictional batman suit). For a decent sized parachute, you would more or less be carrying something that would make you look ridiculous. \n\nThis is ignoring some logistical issues like the fact that most of these materials are flammable and if you are in a dragon fight, the parachute may just end up being kindle before you even get to use it. \n\nBut even with all that noted, deployment is also an issue. The modern parachute has mechanisms to deploy them quickly and efficiently to do so, but even then, you are looking at a minimum height of 2000 ft or so for safe deployment. A dragon in danger won't even clear that height in a normal battle and of you are higher still, you may well just get attacked by the other dragon that you probably just lost against. \n\nOverall, you would be better served just winning.",

If it is a major battle, the archers would have a fun time trying to arrow you directly, or damage the parachute enough that you fall.\n\nAlso the Targ's thought they were like gods, so the very idea of bailing out of a dragon fight would be so alien to them.",
