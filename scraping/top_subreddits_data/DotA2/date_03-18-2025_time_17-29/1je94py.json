Dealt Physical damage so BKB won't save you. Red mines were invis and made no sound, but only detonated if you walked directly on top.\n\nW was stasis traps which back then used to STUN in AOE. It was still considered overall a pointless skill since they took alot of time to set off and you are better off just killing people with Q or R stacks.\n\nE was [REDACTED] Attack! Instantly denied Techies but dealt huge damage on the area he denied at. You had to physically walk to enemies and it used to be something like 1050 damage. Very easy to get kills in lane with this.\n\nR was the green mines, this removal is more recent but basically, you planted them similar to red mines but you could detonate them manually and dealt magical damage.\n\nOld Techies aghs would give him the Mine sign which back in the day made it so any mines on its AOE were immune to detection of any kind. Also increased damage on his ult. This sign could not be destroyed either. This made pushing highground against techies even more impossible than today, leading to common 90+ minute games.\n\n\nThis is the Techies experience and why we loved it when the game was more casual.",

You'd be staring at the map to know or guess where everyone was, where they'll be in 5 minutes and whether or not it's worth your time going there.\n\nI had a freaking spreadsheet with damage numbers for different amounts of mines, armour, magic resist... I'd be checking everyone's items and stats lol\n\nThe Aghs was specially fun because you could place it somewhere with no mines to have people avoid the area and walk into the spot where you actually had placed the mines. It was a constant guessing game and I was stupidly good at it. I probably used it the way it was \"intended\" like 2/5 times only. Most of the time it was just a bluff.\n\nI don't even think the hero would work as well nowadays. The map is huge, there's barely any spots that are actually unreachable (placing mines inside the tree clusters was a way to avoid detection) and everyone has a million HP.",
