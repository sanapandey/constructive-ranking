The entire thing is actually printed with an FDM printer, as I just wanted to try it (I usually would use resin for a miniature).\n\nThe base I just quickly created in fusion, and 3D printed from transparent PETG, then added some terrain features with modelling clay and the usual scale modelling stuff. \n\nThere are some cheap LEDs below the base so the pentagram glows through the very thin paint over the transparent plastic.",
