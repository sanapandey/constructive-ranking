One can not want that a teacher can grade their own children, while it may bother much less if the teacher is friend of the parents of the child.",

Their self-esteem or future course or career choices and opportunities etc. A pundit's opinion or evaluation of a Dota 2 game, play or team don't really matter in any practical way, they are just entertainment for the viewers. As long as the viewers know that they are associated with a certain team, I'd trust them enough to take an overly positive opinion with a grain of salt - people scream \"biased caster\" plenty as is, even without direct association of talent. And if some new viewer came away from a broadcast with a slightly higher opinion of TS as a result of listening to Ephey's commentary (assuming she would hold back criticism because of this association), then what's the harm, really?\n\nSeems certainly outweighed to me by the possibility of easier access to internal information. I'd rather have a coach tell me about what a player or their training environment is like in person on a panel, at the cost of them pulling a punch or two criticizing. Especially since I a) don't think the latter is even a given, panelists already tend to hold back, precisely because they don't know what's going on behind the scenes - e.g. if a bad play is a player or team decision. And b) since panels and casts are rarely ever solo, so you'll have other voices who will be glad to point out mistakes not mentioned by the biased person in question.",
