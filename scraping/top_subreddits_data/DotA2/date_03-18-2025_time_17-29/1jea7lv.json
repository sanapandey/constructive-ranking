    "selftext": "Anton \"dyrachyo\" Shkredov has officially stepped away from competitive Dota 2 for now, leaving behind a legacy that few can match. Over the past two seasons, he has been nothing short of a monster, winning an unparalleled eight Tier 1 tournaments, lifting trophies across multiple teams, from Gaimin Gladiators to Tundra Esports. The 8 events are:\n\n1. Lima Major 2023\n\n2. DreamLeague Season 19\n\n3. ESL One Berlin Major 2023 \n\n4. DreamLeague Season 20\n\n5. Bali Major 2023\n\n6. Riyadh Masters 2024\n\n7. FISSURE PLAYGROUND #1\n\n8. BLAST Slam II\n\nHe was a key part of the legendary Gaimin Gladiators roster that won three Majors in a row and went on to claim multiple DreamLeague titles and the Riyadh Masters 2024. Even after transitioning to Tundra, he continued his winning ways, securing back-to-back championships.  \n\nHe also get second place at:\n\n1. ESL One Kuala Lumpur 2023\n\n2. The International 2023\n\n3. The International 2024\n\n4. PGL Wallachia Season 3\n\n5. DreamLeague Season 25\n\nThe total prize he won are $1,460,002.\n\nWhile he fell just short of The International title placing second at TI12 and TI13, his dominance in regular-season events is undeniable. In a game where consistency is the hardest thing to achieve, dyrachyo made winning look effortless. His hyper-aggressive playstyle, clutch decision-making, and ability to completely take over games made him a nightmare for opponents.  \n\nNow, as he steps away from the scene, we can only thank him for the incredible performances he has given us. Whether this is a break or the end of an era, one thing is certain: dyrachyo is one of the greatest Dota 2 carry players of the last two years.\n\nGG, WP, and all the best to the beast.",

Yes, Nightfall will play for zero deaths there, but he will be eliminated from the tournament. Let be. I don't want to be such a better carry. Let me be the worst carry, but I will win and keep doing it for some distance. It doesn't matter how the best you are, because only the whole team of five people wins and loses here. In my opinion, all these value judgments about the best and so on are rather misleading. But I can understand people who give such estimates, because they often do not know what is happening within the team.",

Despite earning less prize money than some of his peers, he won more Tier 1 tournaments than anyone else in the last two seasons or maybe last 5 years? never see someone holding so many title in such a short time, even though Falcons player are more or less the same but they never reach TI or Riyadh Grand final.",

Even when the meta moved away from deathball Gaimin committed to that strategy and dyrachyo was a crucial part of that: his map movements enabled Ace to play greedy which he likes to do and gave space for Quinn to catch up if he had a poor start. He had more 4head moments than your average carry but that's not unexpected for a player who has such a hyper-aggressive mindset. \n\nI don't believe he was removed from Gaimin for play-related reasons, I believe the team thought they had reached their peak and could not improve without making a roster change and dyrachyo was the odd man out personality-wise. And he played very well for Tundra, their results speak for themselves in the short time he was there. I'm looking forward to when he comes back to the pro scene.",
