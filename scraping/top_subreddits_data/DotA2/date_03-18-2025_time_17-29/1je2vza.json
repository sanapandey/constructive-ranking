    "selftext": "Gyro's new innate, *Chop Shop*, is a cool concept, but I think it could be slightly improved for a smoother experience. Right now, when you sell an item built with a recipe, you only get **half the gold from the base components like any other hero**, and the recipe cost is completely lost\u2014**unless you manually disassemble it first**.\n\nSince *Chop Shop* already lets Gyro **sell recipes for full cost**, why not extend that to automatically **refund the recipe cost when selling an item**? This would remove an unnecessary step and make the ability feel more fluid.\n\n# Example:\n\n* **Current Sell Price (Normal Hero)** \u2192 Magic Wand sells for **225 gold** (only half of the components' cost, recipe is lost).\n* **Proposed** ***Chop Shop*** **QoL Change** \u2192 Magic Wand sells for **300 gold** (same component sell price, but recipe is refunded).\n\nJust a quality of life buff that makes *Chop Shop* more intuitive  \nThanks for coming to my TED Talk",
