You are also very good at counter ganking if the enemy mid feels the need to gank if the lane is not going well, since you have torrent and boat.\n\nWhat I build is normally a bottle, bracer, wand and phase boots, after that, you can see what the team need, if you can make Blademail work, then go for it, or an orchid if you can ensure one of the enemy hero can have a terrible game. After that, you might need a bkb if they are jumping you to stop you from casting, but if not, I always go for Scepter, and while is not as good as waterpark, its a great teamfight item that disrupts the fight inmediatly. After that, Shivas is often great, and Refresher after that.\n\nYou build him as a complete team fight hero, and can build auras if the team needs it and the offlane is someone like a LC, but its not a solo kill hero, and if your team is not playing together and/or the carry is bad, you are likely going to lose, but its definitely a hero that can give you wins.

Almost every match I've been Drow.\n\n\nGranted, they've been able to smack me around if they're up close and I do not yet have my Linken's, but by the time I have my Linkin's I usually have my no mana cost Gust. My first item, after 2 Wraith's and boots is Aghs. Then Pike, then Yasha and Kaya, and then Linkin's.\n\n\nBy the time I get to that Linkin's, AM becomes such a non-issue. The usual play-by-play goes something like this:\n\n\n1. AM blinks, pops manta, goes to stun.\n\n\n2. Stun is blocked by Linkin's, I Gust 2 of the 3 AMs and try to reposition for a Multi-shot.\n\n\n3. **IF** my Multi-shot hits all 3, then the real AM is identified and I Pike him. **IF NOT**, I Pike away toward base and disengage. **IF it's a team fight**, things are far different BUT I will try to Pike away to reposition and likely attack a different hero.\n\n\n4. AM goes to blink away as soon as Silence is over, but I'm already shooting him with Frost Arrows on Auto-cast. Usually dead by the 6th Arrow.\n\n\nKeep in mind, these AMs have been farming for 30 minutes at this point. Maybe more. My best aghs has been 12 minutes and change. My usual aghs is 17 minutes and change.\n\n\nI feel like I'm outfarming AM, and a lot of the time all it takes is my team focusing him for just a moment and he's gone. For supposedly being anti-magic, he gets countered by all kinds of stuns and spells now.\n\n\nAM is a shadow of the death machine he was 3 years ago. I remember spending a massive portion of my 12+ years of DotA scared of this guy because he was practically guaranteed to take out at least 1 teammate in a team fight.\n\n\nI do not fear him anymore, and I know it can't be how I've been playing because I've seen this guy go completely crazy under more circumstances. I remember when he would shrug off all kinds of shit.",
