    "selftext": "Went to the store because I forgot cabbage for corned beef & cabbage. but they were all sold out of the normal green. I saw what looked to be cabbage put in a hydraulic press, figured it would be interesting to try something new. Popped the corned beef in a slow cooker, followed by the wedged cabbage with two hours to go.\n\nHoly crap this stuff is delicious. Slightly sweet with a delicate flavor, no harsh bitter notes, and a very pleasant texture! Will definitely be using it every year now.\n\nI still have half of a head since I couldn't fit everything into the crock pot. Any awesome cabbage recipes you all enjoy? Was figuring an asian slaw, but I'm willing to try something new.",

When you can really smell the garlic fragrance, pile in chopped cabbage, add salt and a couple splashes of vinegar, and stir fry until soft. Simple but delicious. It doesn't really work that well with cabbages other than Taiwanese cabbage because other kinds don't soften well enough.",

My wife makes sauerkraut on the regular, and the flat cabbage always has way more juice over the cabbage in the crock.  \n\nAny recipe would be similar in my experience, but would likely need to cut back on liquids until you see how the flat cabbage releases it's natural juices.",

You can have it as a side dish or add it to fried rice, or yaki soba noodles. \n\nOccasionally I\u2019ll even use Taiwanese cabbage in soups too, but I generally prefer Napa cabbage for soups.",

All I knew was that I didn't like cabbage at all, except when I would go to Taiwan there would be cabbage that somehow wasn't terrible. Only when I became an adult who shops/cooks and I saw Taiwanese cabbage at the Asian grocery store did I realize, oh it's a different cabbage! Using Taiwanese cabbage for corned beef dinner is a great idea, I wish I had thought of that before I made dinner last night...",
