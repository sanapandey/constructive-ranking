I feel.so free from deciding on what to cook when all I have to do now is slap some cold cuts, mayo and lettuce on a hero and I'm done.  I'm so done with cooking. Am I the only one who gets tired of cooking occasionally.",

It's amazing what you can do with nothing when you actually *have* to do something.\n\nMeal planning is hard work that requires a lot of executive function. My husband was diagnosed with ADHD after he threw a full-on tantrum because he didn't want to plan meals. After he died, I lost all of my ability to function in the kitchen, and I realized how hard that shit actually is (we got a HUGE gift card to the local grocery, and just ate out of the deli; to this day, the food still tastes like despair)!!!\n\nNo shame to people who can survive without meal planning. I would fucking love to not have to do it (I probably wouldn't if my son weren't around; I'd just take a few bites from the head of cabbage in the fridge, and eat ramen).",

Frequent trips to the store for fresh produce, meal planning, washing, trimming, etc. Def more work involved when you can't just open a can or box. So, when I cook and meal prep I make extra. I always have a large box of salad, mostly sturdy stuff like cabbage, kale, carrots, collards, mustard greens, etc., pre-made in the fridge and ready to go. I make my salad dressing once a week. When I cook hot meals I make extra to freeze so when those feelings come around all I have to do is pull pre-made meals out of the freezer. And, if I'm feeling particularly lazy, I just decide to fast. Fasting has a lot of health benefits and I don't need to think about what to cook. It also has the added benefit of making everything taste really good when I do eat again. \ud83d\ude0b",

I also freeze most of what I meal prep as a way to avoid having to eat the same lunch for the entire workweek, which often leads to flavors falling down after thawing and a lot of samey textures. I learned during the pandemic that if I don't meal prep, I'll never get any actual meat or vegetables in my diet, because dealing with those is so much messier and requires more prep and cleanup than just cooking pasta. It means that a little over half of my meals are rather boring, but it keeps me fed, and that's what matters.\n\nBeing able to meal prep long-term requires a willingness to eat just for fuel at least some of the time, but I think that helps make those times when I cook something new and fresh and awesome that much more special.",

My son and I do a lot of bits and pieces meals- cheese, deli meat or charcuterie, any type of bread with any type of spread, whatever little scraps of fruit and vegetables. If you already do have deli meats and cheeses, I really love to chop them up coarsely and mix them into cold pasta with mayo and red wine vinegar or Italian dressing.",
