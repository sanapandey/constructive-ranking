    "selftext": "When other people make chicken thighs, it is one of the greatest foods I've ever eaten. But when I try to make it? Forget about that, because I can NOT for the life of me make it taste like anything other than a rubbery gym sock.\n\nRegardless of the oven temperature, how long I cook them, brand/type of chicken thighs, seasonings, salts, if I brine or not, oil type, oil amount, etc., nothing is ever different. Also yes, I've even used different ovens and it still happens.\n\nI've heard about how you're supposed to cook the chicken thighs to an internal temperature of around 185 because that's when the collagen begins to melt. Okay, so I target that and... the outside of the chicken is dried out, and the inside is still rubbery. No flavor though.\n\nI cook it at 400 degrees for 40 minutes? Rubbery and uncooked. Cook it for like 50 minutes? Overcooked. Cook it at a lower temperature for longer, like 250 degrees for a long period of time? Flavorless and dry. 350? Either too dry or too rubbery. Flavorless? Add more salt then... but now it just tastes salty and rubbery now. Add in more seasonings like butter, garlic, or poultry seasoning? Flavors the outside, but nothing on the inside, and also either keeps the skin from cooking or burns the outside anyway.\n\nI genuinely don't even know what I'm doing wrong. Every video I follow, or every tip I read on cooking chicken things, they ultimately add up to nothing. I've even tried using air-chilled chicken to see if it makes a flavor difference, and ultimately it doesn't really make a difference.\n\nBut I've been trying to get chicken thighs to work for years now, and I just... CAN'T.",

Are you getting boneless skinless thighs because they are less forgiving\u2026 need more info on the cut and the cooking method.\n\nI personally buy bone in thighs, remove the bone, and cook them on the stove skin side down to render the fat and finish in a 350-375 degree oven once the skin is crispy, but those are boneless skin on thighs that I like to dry brine to remove excess moisture before cooking",

A common practice done in East Asia to check whether meat is fully cooked is if a chopstick can easily poke through without any resistance, and if the juice that runs out is clear.",

Same cooking method, set the same every time. \n\nDoing it 100 times *a day*.

But I suppose it's just douchey to \"assume\" people didn't have ways of dealing with deadly diseases before then.

Your way will result in rendered fat slowly basting the thigh as it cooks, which is tasty and convenient as the oily surface will brown better in an oven. Assuming you finish with the broiler it also leaves the skin right up next to the element to get nice and crispy at the end as a bonus.\n\nIn a pan however you generally need some oil right from the get go for good thermal contact, but since thighs come preloaded with a bunch of fat under the skin, starting skin side down is a good way to get some fat to quickly render out. It also comes with the benefit of making sure the skin starts getting cooked hard right away, helping to get it crispy. Duck breast is often cooked very similarly.",

I do not reccomend over salting (as a person that tries to learn to eat with less salt).  I use Tony Cacheres ((cajun)) seasoned salt ((others use old bay)) or just fresh ground salt and pepper, and also garlic powder on both sides, I use the garlic powder on the heavier side as it imparts a salty taste, but not too heavy.\n\nNow rub in seasoning with a little olive oil.  (And there are a million ways to season and cook, but this is just basics).  Fill a Pyrex casserole pan with aprox 1/16 th to 1/8 th inch olive oil or whatever oil you have.  Set seasoned chicken thighs in pan (skin side up) into a preheated 350 degree oven.  (Can preheat oiled pan).  \n\nNow cook for 45 minutes.  If not pleased with crispness of top skin, not seeing alot of melted fats, turn up heat to 375 or 400 for 10- 20 minutes, that would be pretty normal to do.  There's some variation here, like how cold the chicken was before going in pan.  But in general an hour or so should be plenty w/o overcooking or undercooking the chicken.  \n\nHope I helped, good luck!  Skin on baked thighs are one of my faves!  (But unfortunately, I've cooked them for so long now, I don't exactly pay attention to my exact cook times anymore).  \n\nIf you're thermometer isn't working right. Might be time for a new one.

Try poaching some skinless boneless smaller chicken pieces in bone broth using a meat thermometer. \n\nWon\u2019t take long. Check the texture and consistency just to see what you think.  \n\n\nOr try a very quick stir fry.  Again check with meat thermometer for pieces. \n\nThey will cook some off the heat so allow for that. \n\nGood luck.",

            "body": "Are your thighs boneless or bone in? I cook boneless chicken thighs 3 times a week and they come out perfectly.\n\nSeason them liberally with the seasoning of your choice (no oil). I use McCormick's Grill Mates Sweet And Smoky rub. Get something heavy and pound the meat out until it's around 1/4 inch thick (6.35 mm). \n\nHeat a pan to medium/medium low (you'll find the perfect temp for your stove after you cook this a couple of times). Add a small amount of cooking oil to the pan (I use olive oil, but it doesn't matter). Thighs go in and don't get touched.\n\nAt this point, I am listening. As the chicken fat renders, it will make a low sizzle. After 6-12 minutes, a lot of moisture will evaporate and the meat will sear. The sizzle will make a completely different high pitched sound. That's the sound of flavor, and it's time to flip the thigh over.\n\nThe pan side of the thigh should have a thick golden crust. If there's no crust at all, it probably needs more time. If the crust is very light, your pan temp was a little low. If it's a blackened crust, then your pan temp was too high and burnt the seasonings. Even if you burnt the crust, the chicken will still be good and edible.\n\nOnce flipped, we'll do the same on the other side -*listening* for when it's done. Both sides will take around the same amount of time.\n\nVisually, you should see a brown crust on both sides and the fat/skin should be rendered, not white and floppy. Depending on the thigh, you might need to baste a little bit to render everything evenly. There should be a firmness when you press the thigh with your finger. When you cut in, there should be no translucent pink band in the center. It's ok if you see some dark reds and browns, since that's just how dark meat is. If it's rubbery, then the pan temp was too high or you waited too long to flip.",
