The very mention of the dish turns my stomach, it amazes me that people enjoy corned beef and cabbage at all period (to me it is the epitome of a struggle meal) and that anyone would want to willingly make bubble and squeak makes me even more surprised.\n\nBut I'm happy for you guys if you enjoy this!",

I would normally make fried mashed potatoes for breakfast but never crossed my mind to add veggies to them. I\u2019ll do this next time!",
