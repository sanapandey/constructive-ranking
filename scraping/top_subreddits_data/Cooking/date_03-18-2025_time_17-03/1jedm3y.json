    "selftext": "The earlier post about family beach trip reminded me of a dilemma I have coming up\u2014we do a weeklong big family beach trip every year, and each family does a dinner. The catch is that half of the family are vegetarians and half are meat eaters. Everyone always does one meal with an add on meat option-and my father in law gets grumpy if there\u2019s no meat. There is always at least one or sometimes two Mexican nights and the rest of the nights are normally some form of pasta, so I\u2019d like to avoid that. Last year we did Greek bowls that worked really well (rice, Greek chicken, falafel, Greek salad, and hummus) so looking for any other ideas. My only thought so far is to grill regular burgers/impossible burgers (the vegetarians are big impossible burger fans) and do potato salad and maybe bean salad, but thought I\u2019d see if there were any better ideas.
