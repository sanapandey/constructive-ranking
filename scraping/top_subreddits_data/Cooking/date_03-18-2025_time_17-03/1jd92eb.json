            "body": "My husband and I bought a whole cow a month ago, well on Sunday we lost power until late last night (Monday.) I ran our generator off and on throughout the day to keep the 2 chest freezers cold. We didn\u2019t run them overnight and the warmest the freezers got was 16\u00b0F over 12 hours. I checked the meat in the morning and it was still solid, not bendable at all, kicked the generator back on, then temps fluctuated between -7&7\u00b0 before kicking on generator. \nI know this is a silly question, but is the meat still safe? It usually is frozen at -7\u00b0F, but just need peace of mind I suppose that we didn\u2019t just throw thousands down the drain. Thanks!",
