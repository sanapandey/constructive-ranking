Alternatively, if you have found content that isn't yours but you want  to share, this weekly post will be the perfect place for it. A new  thread will be created on each Monday and stickied.\n\nWe will continue to allow certain high-quality contributors to share  their wealth of knowledge, including video content, as self-posts,  outside of the weekly YouTube/Content Round-Up. However, this will be on  a very limited basis and at the sole discretion of the moderator team.  Posts that meet this standard will have a thorough discussion of the  recipe, maybe some commentary on what's unique or important about it, or  what's tricky about it, minimal (if any) requests to view the user's  channel, subscriptions, etc. Link dropping, even if the full recipe is  included in the text per Rule 2, will not meet this standard. Most other  self-posts which include user-created content will be removed and  referred to the weekly post. All other [/r/Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking) rules still apply as well.",

These have been to fulfill my own need, but I'm going to start posting the things that I make here to see if it can benefit people. \n\nThere aren't any ads or sponsorships or anything. \n\nFor this time, I've been curious about spices, herbs and spices mixes so I made this database and tool. I have seen people here asking about things like brown gravy mix, taco spice mix and curry powder so it may be useful. I do hope to spark discussions with others who are curious too. Link to the tool is above.\n\nIt doesn't work on mobile devices it seems.\n\nUntil next week.",
