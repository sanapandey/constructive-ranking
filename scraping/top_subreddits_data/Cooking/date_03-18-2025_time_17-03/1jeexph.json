    "selftext": "\nI\u2019ve been a long time reader of this sub and wanted to share some tips from my own experience. Hope you enjoy.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last 50 years immersed in kitchens around the world, working in bustling markets in Southeast Asia, high-end bistros in Europe, and remote fishing villages where the day\u2019s catch dictated the menu. I\u2019ve learned from master chefs and grandmothers alike, picking up techniques and traditions that transcend borders.\n\nAfter decades of cooking in bustling kitchens across the globe, I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s about embracing the unexpected and finding joy in the process. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve gathered over the years:\n\n1. Chase Ingredients, Not Recipes\n\nDon\u2019t plan dishes around recipes, let the freshest local ingredients dictate what\u2019s on the plate. Farmers\u2019 markets, fishmongers, and butchers often inspire the best creations.\n\n2. Befriend the Dishwashers\n\nThe heartbeat of any kitchen isn\u2019t the head chef, it\u2019s the dish pit. Treat the dish team with respect, and you\u2019ll always have someone who\u2019s got your back when the kitchen is slammed.\n\n3. Eat Where the Chefs Eat\n\nWhen exploring a new city, ask a local chef where they go after their shift. Late-night dives, unassuming street stalls, and family-owned spots often serve food that tells the real story of a place.\n\n4. Learn the \u2018Grandma Technique\u2019\n\nEvery cuisine has techniques passed down through generations that aren\u2019t in any cookbook. Whether it\u2019s how to fold dumplings in Shanghai or make perfect tagine in Marrakech, find the grandmothers and ask them to show you.\n\n5. Master One Knife\n\nYou don\u2019t need a drawer full of knives\u2014one great chef\u2019s knife that feels like an extension of your hand can tackle 90% of the work. Learn to sharpen it properly and treat it like gold.\n\n6. Say Yes to the Unfamiliar\n\nIf you\u2019re offered an ingredient or dish you\u2019ve never tried, say yes. Whether it\u2019s fermented shark in Iceland or deep-fried tarantulas in Cambodia, embracing the unknown builds a palate that\u2019s as broad as it is adventurous.\n\n7. Cook for People, Not Praise\n\nThe best meals are the ones that bring people together, not the ones chasing Michelin stars. Cook with love, and everything else follows.\n\n8. Mistakes Are the Best Teachers\n\nYou\u2019ll burn sauces, over-salt stocks, and ruin souffl\u00e9s. But in every failure is a lesson that sharpens your instincts and deepens your intuition.\n\n9. Travel to Taste\n\nSome of the best culinary lessons aren\u2019t learned in kitchens but on the streets, in the mountains, or by the ocean. Eating local, asking questions, and being open to new flavors broadens your understanding of food in ways books never will.\n\n10. Never Stop Being a Student\n\nThe world of food is infinite\u2014new techniques, cuisines, and ingredients are always waiting to be explored. Stay curious, and the kitchen will always be an adventure.\n\nThe magic of food lies in the stories it tells, the cultures it honors, and the people it brings together. Cook with curiosity, eat with wonder, and never stop learning.",

I like having the kitchen mostly clean when serving. Nothing brings me down more than having to clean up a trashed kitchen after spending all the time prepping and cooking.",

Don't fall for the illusion of \"the right way\". the best dishes are made when people dare to try new things.\n\n- repeat your dishes. The best meals are born of repetition, and the world of social media can convince you to make new recipes everyday. Instead try making variations of things that you know",
