Do you have an allergy? \n\nRice - and other starches, like oatmeal, quinoa, vermicelli, bread crumbs, crushed crackers, etc - are binders that hold the filling together and keep it moist. \n\nIf you need a low carb binder, I recommend eggs and mozzarella cheese. The biggest issue with low carb binders is that they don't absorb liquid, so stuffed peppers can get a little bit watery.",
