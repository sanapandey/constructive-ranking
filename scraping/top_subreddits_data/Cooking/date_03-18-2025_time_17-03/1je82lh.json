    "selftext": "For starters, I\u2019m sorry if this is in the wrong place. I was going to post in r/AskCulinary, but the rules suggested posting here if you don\u2019t have a recipe.\n\nNow, I know tenderloin isn\u2019t the preferred cut for pulled pork. I remembered that when I was little, one of my favorite things my grandfather would make me was pulled pork, and the one time he showed me how to make it (we had a routine of him teaching me how to make a new dish each time I went to stay with him), he had used tenderloin. It always came out great, but he had much more cooking experience than I do. So when I was at the store, I grabbed one on sale, not realizing that it isn\u2019t the usual cut one would use.\n\nI\u2019ve found a few recipes online for pulled pork tenderloin in a slow cooker, but we recently moved, and I haven\u2019t yet bought any sort of slow cooker or crockpot. I\u2019ve found a lot of recipes for pulled pork in a Dutch oven, but they all call for the more optimal pork shoulder. I\u2019m more of a baker, and don\u2019t have enough cooking experience to combine the methods and be confident that I\u2019m doing it right.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t have a slow cooker, I do have a cast iron Dutch oven that I was hoping would suffice. I humbly ask the r/Cooking community if anyone has suggestions for how I can make pulled pork in a Dutch oven with tenderloin & any measures I can take to help prevent it from drying out too much. Please help me get BBQ pulled pork sandwiches in my family\u2019s bellies tonight. I\u2019ve already started on the buns. \n\nThank you in advance Reddit.\n\n~A tired mom who just wants a pulled pork sandwich",

            "body": "Tenderloin is quite literally the worst cut of meat for pulled pork due to a lack of fat and connective tissue. \n\nThat said, everything falls to shreds if you cook it long enough. Dutch oven is fine, just simmer it until you can easily twist it apart with a fork.",

You can also slice it into rounds, stack 'em up, and then slice further into shreds/strips if you want to make sure!\n\nIf you shave it into super thin slices against the grain BEFORE you cook it, I think it will be even closer to the texture you want. This is how I prep tenderloin for stir-frying, and the meat both falls apart a bit because it is so thin and curls up into strips when cooked.",
