    "selftext": "Made a batch of candied kumquats with bourbon vanilla and cardamom syrup. The flavor was spectacularly good, but they are so spicy! You just eat one of them and your mouth and throat and lips are tingling. I had no idea! I\u2019m going to make a second batch but with just the teensiest pinch of cardamom.\n\nUPDATE: two other people tried them and one said it was not peppery/tingly to the mouth, tongue and lips but the other said it was \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nUPDATE: stomach upset, definitely an allergy, thanks for the info as I would not have thought of it ",

People are typically allergic to certain plant proteins in specific nuts of specific species or families of plants.\n\nIn the case of sumac, it comes from the same family as mangoes, cashews, and poison ivy (Anacardiaceae). If you're allergic to proteins in any of those things, you may have sensitivity to sumac as well. Or not - allergies are often fairly specific to certain antigens, and someone who is allergic to cashews may not be allergic to mangoes etc.\n\nBut back to the original point - if you're allergic to other nuts, say hazelnuts, there's no particular reason to think you'd also be allergic to sumac, as they're no more closely related than either is to many other plants in the vast clade of [Rosids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosids).",
