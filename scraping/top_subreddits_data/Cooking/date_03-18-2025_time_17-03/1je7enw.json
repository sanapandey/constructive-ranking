    "selftext": "Every year we do a family beach trip and recently I\u2019ve been handling the planning, prep and cooking for dinners. To be clear, I love it. I really enjoy cooking for big groups, and the house we rent has an insane kitchen that I thoroughly enjoy using to its full potential. \n\nThis year though, I want to step up from the hot dogs, hamburgers and grilled chicken to some meals that are still family friendly and cost effective, but that have a little more\u2026je ne sais quoi if you will. \n\nHere are the logistics: \n\n- 8 adults and 7 kids ages 2-8. \n\n- I am a few hours from the beach and we drive, plus all major grocery options/wholesale clubs are available to us. So I can prep and shop beforehand. For instance I make a big pot of pasta salad here the day before we leave and bring it with us. Coolers, containers and cargo space aplenty, no concerns about any of that. \n\n- This kitchen is stocked really well. Tons of spices, 2 crock pots, at least one Dutch oven and there\u2019s obviously a grill. Appliance wise I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I\u2019d be lacking or couldn\u2019t bring with if needed, though I\u2019d prefer to keep it simple in terms of equipment. \n\n- We have one adult who is medically gluten free and we have one child with a severe peanut allergy. Typically I\u2019ll buy gluten free rolls or gluten free pasta for the adult but really need to stay away from nuts in any recipe just to ensure the little guy stays safe. \n\nSo far I\u2019m planning on definitely burgers and dogs just as a classic and I was also thinking about a light shrimp pasta along with doing a taco night where I made pork carnitas here and then assembled with the produce there. What do y\u2019all like for summer-y, beach-y meals that can feed a group? \n\n",

Honestly, I love a charcuterie board for post beach snack, and depending on what is on it, it can be elevated while still appealing to simpler tastes (cheese, meats, fruit, pickles and olives, jams and spreads, and crackers).",
