You can potentially find hundreds of dollars worth of choice edible mushrooms.\n\n\nThey are only around for about 2 months a year - in late March to late May. Once soil temperatures are at 50 degrees for 3 consecutive days, then it is officially morel season.\n\n\nMorels are mycorrhizal mushrooms, meaning they grow on roots of trees. As the forest is coming out of hibernation, these mushrooms use this time for some reason to reproduce. It's a mystery why, with some theories being the electrical signals firing off in the trees during blooming season may trigger something. I just don't know and it's magical.\n\n\nIt's a blast finding them. It's really hard, until it's not. Finding the first one is always difficult, and then once your eye catches it in person, then you're locked in on more and they just appear to you. Easter egg hunts aren't just for kids.",

You can also make filled pastries, mushroom risotto, pasta... or season and dehydrate them (with seasoning) as a snack! Teriyaki mushrooms are amazing with rice, and I love making mushroom stock to drink as is too (dehydrated mushroom work very well as the process breaks their cellulose cell walls if i am not mistaken and releases more flavor compounds). You can also make shroom burgers (lengthy but amazing, esp if you make the bread buns too! king arthur's recipe is amazing). Korean cuisine has amazing mushroom recipes!! As an italian i of course adore mushrooms and we also have plenty of recipes since we have many in italy and there is a huge interest in foraging them :) if you love mushrooms try a truffle oil (since they are still mushrooms) to drizzle on top of your roasted mushrooms!",

A lot of people don't realize this if it's sauce or broth based because the sauces don't have mushrooms chunks but they have that good umami flavor. This also includes noodle dishes like Pho and Ramen if that's your jam. Stir fries are good with mushrooms...lots of things. \n\nPizza... pepperoni and mushroom was so good! \n\nSauteed mushrooms and steak, or on burgers\n\nDon't forget truffle oil on basically anything lol. I am very allergic to truffle and I know there are debates about whether it is a mushroom or fungus or something. To me it's all the same because I have the same reaction. The last time I was exposed it was truffle oil in mashed potatoes. And yes, it was good! I didn't know it was in there though.
