So far, I\u2019ve tested a bunch of store brand snacks and I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised. \n\nThat is, until I tried Walmart brand cheez its. Oh my goodness. It was like eating little squares made 99% of crispy butter with a little cheese sprinkled in. So, so gross. \n\nWhat other store brand foods are not worth the low cost? ",

The bronze dies leave a rougher texture to the pasta. People will often say this means it holds more sauce. The testing I've seen does not indicate this to be true. However, the rougher texture of the pasta of the bronze die cut simply tastes better in conjunction with the sauce. \n\nSecond, since the bronze die cut pasta is rougher, it has more dried starch clinging to the outside of it. Once added to boiling water, this free starch will release into the water. Many pasta dishes/sauces are finished with a little of the pasta boil water as the starchy water will help thicken the sauce. You can imitate this a little better with the Teflon cut stuff by using much less water to boil the pasta, however this requires more attention to not have the pasta stick and still probably won't work as well.\n\nIt's truly worth trying bronze die cut pasta at least once if you're used to the Teflon stuff.

I make both marinara and Alfredo from scratch that are both far superior to any pre-made sauces I've tried. It's the same for salsa to me.

I use full semolina flour, eggs, a little olive oil, a little salt.  Sometimes I\u2019ll saut\u00e9 some spinach, emulsify it in the food processor, and add it to the dough.\n\nHand made pasta is cheap, easy, and delicious.

Instead, what I do is just find the absolute cheapest butter that I can use without noticing the off-taste. No store brand to-date has passed my blind taste test. I can always tell when butter is shitty, even in a finished baked good. So what I did was buy every brand of butter at my local chain grocery store and did a test to see at what point I stopped noticing the weird taste. For me, that point was Challenge branded butter. I am not saying that this is the right answer for everyone, as I have close friends who swear that Land O'Lakes is better than Challenge. But for my personal taste, the inflection point of butter going from tasting noticeably bad to only tasting actually a little good was when I upped my price range to Challenge butter. There was a time not that long ago when store-brand butter worked fine for something like buttercream for a cake, but I simply can't do that now without a noticeably off-taste.",

I've had my husband taste test and he's confirmed I'm not crazy (well, most of the time). It is absolutely more bland than the high quality stuff, but it shouldn't have an underlying sweet note.\n\nApparently I'm just tasting the difference between cultured/tangy and sweet cream butter, but I steer away from store bought because it shines through whatever I'm making and I really can tell.",

In a large mixing bowl, add the sorted dried pinto beans and fill the bowl with enough water to cover the beans by an inch or so. Set aside to soak for 15 minutes while you prepare the remaining ingredients.\n2. Prepare Garlic Better then Bullion in the instant pot.\n3. To the Instant Pot bowl, add the chopped onion, garlic cloves, jalapeno, dried oregano, chili powder, ground cumin, ground black pepper, 1 tsp salt, and bacon grease. \n4. Use a colander to strain the beans and discard the soaking liquid. Rinse with fresh water.\n5. Now add the beans to the Instant Pot bowl, and stir all of the ingredients together. Grease will melt as soon as the Instant Pot comes up to pressure/temperature.\n6. Close the Instant Pot and ensure the steam release valve is set to sealing. Set the Instant Pot to \u201cBean/Chili\u201d for 45 minutes. When the Instant Pot is done cooking let it release naturally.\n7. When the pressure is finally released, open the lid of the Instant Pot and add remaining salt to taste. Use an immersion blender to blend the beans to the desired consistency. The beans will appear soupy, but don\u2019t worry \u2013 they will thicken as they cool.\n\nNotes: I use pickled jarred jalapenos for consistent heat. Fresh can be substituted if desired. I use Bacon-Up bacon grease when we don't have enough collected. I also use 2tbsp of a borracho bean spice mix from HEB instead of the listed spices but this is where I started.\n\nOriginal Source: [https://www.allergyfreealaska.com/instant-pot-refried-beans/](https://www.allergyfreealaska.com/instant-pot-refried-beans/)\n\nOriginal Author: Megan Ancheta",

Put in the inner liner of the Instant Pot.\nAdd the broth or water.\nPress the Saut\u00e9 button on the IP to start warming up the broth or water. This helps the IP come to pressure quicker.\nAdd the chopped onion, fat or oil, jalape\u00f1o, garlic, spices, and bay leaf and stir.\nPress the Cancel/Keep Warm button to cancel the saut\u00e9 mode. Put the lid on the IP and set the steam release knob to the Sealing position.\nPress the Bean/Chili button, and then the or - button to select 45 minutes.\nWhen cooking cycle ends, let the pot sit and naturally release the pressure for about 15-25 minutes, or longer if you want.\nManually release the remaining steam and when the pin in the lid drops, carefully open, with the lid facing away from you.\nStir the beans.\nLadle out most of the extra liquid and set aside.\nUse an immersion blender (or food processor) to blend up the beans (Careful doing this with hot beans). Add back as much of the liquid for the consistency you want.\nNotes\nGarnish with avocado, or Cotija cheese, pepitas, tomatoes, cilantro, or anything you like! \n\nRecipe credit: \n[Instant Pot Refried Beans](https://www.simplyhappyfoodie.com/instant-pot-refried-beans/)",

For example, Daisy brand sour cream is the only one on the market I can find that is just cream, salt, cultures. All the other brands have gums and stabilizers added. Chobani yogurt is just milk and live cultures, all the other brands have stabilizers added. You get the drift. So if you care about that kind of thing, in general I\u2019ve found that store brand cuts the most corners when it comes to dairy. On the other hand, I buy store brand organic cheerios, because of the glyphosate found in non organic oats.",

Use Chobani or Greek Gods plain yogurt as starter (no additives is the important thing).  When milk ferments, all of the bacteria eat lactose.  Almost all lactose intolerant people can digest homemade fermented yogurts.  It also tastes BETTER than anything you ever bought at a store.  I suppose you could get an ice cream maker and try making your own fro-yo also.",

Yogurt is a lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria eat lactose (sugar) and convert it to lactic acid.  To make yogurt you mix like 1/2 cup of store bought yogurt with about 1/2 gallon of milk.  The longer the ferment goes\u2026 the bacteria consume (eat) more lactose and the milk will take on a stronger tart flavor from the lactic acid produced.  \nWhen yogurt is eaten from a store most of the LAB colonies have died off (not all).  The other (primary) benefit of eating diy yogurt is that you are consuming huge quantities of living LAB strains as well.  This also benefits the GI system.  Why?  Because the very diverse colonies of bacteria & viruses that occupy our gut actually give our immune system \u201cinstructions.\u201d  There is alot of science behind this very simple explanation but many unknowns.",

An actual slab of bacon, on the other hand, is something that I just don't eat that often... and I've never noticed my migraines corresponding to any specific dietary change. And God only knows what I'm getting from the rest of my diet. So while I do want to work on eliminating, or at least reducing, those nitrates, it's more a broad strokes mindset at the moment... though given its status as a common trigger I'm also curious if it can build up in my system until it triggers a migraine, which could account for the seeming randomness.\n\n\nAs for magnesium, I need to do more reading on the different types and what effects they have (I don't need the extra help in the bathroom \ud83d\ude05) but I've been drinking mineral water for a while on the assumption it'll be more bioavalable than taking a supplement.\n\n\nBut yeah, migraines are too damn personal for an easy \"what works for me/you\" conversation.

Meijer brand Frosted Mini Wheats are actually better than Kellogg's (by far!), and most store brand cheeses are great (except the Velvetta, LOL).

Dried pasta there aren't really a thousand ways to make them as the base ingredients are pretty... basic so yeah, a lot of them would taste the same!

The Great Value still works fine, but I did notice that the process was easier and that the flavor was a bit better with the Ghirardelli.

We had a shared snack area and one time he restocked it. I saw what I thought was box of REAL cheez its. Because we AGREED!!! I poured out a few and they were so gross! I looked at the box and they were FAKE cheez-its!!! I was so mad. I wrote \"fake cheez-its SUCK\" all over the box. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThen I yelled at him when he came in. I thought it was the ONE thing we always agreed on. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut anyway...I think it's hit or miss. They used to say generics were made in the same plants, but I don't know if that's true. I mostly avoid generics now. I look at the ingredients on what I think are the most basic things, and the generic versions have worse ingredients, like fillers and artificial ingredients. \n\nCanned and frozen vegetables are the exception. I do buy those. And canned beans (whole beans, not refried).",

I've heard that Great Value canned vegetables are actually Del Monte, but the less pretty ones go in the Great Value cans. The milk is also the same as the name brand, though milk name brands tend to be regional. \n\nThe Great Value strawberry Newtons are very hit-or-miss with the texture to me, whereas I haven't had this issue with the Newtons brand (Nabisco?). I'm unsure if the regular fig kind are, as I tend to get the strawberry ones when I buy them. \n\nI've also started buying Kerrygold butter because there's a noticeable improvement in taste over the cheaper brands, though I notice no difference between, say, Land O' Lakes and Great Value, or any supermarket brand. Kerrygold is definitely more expensive, but excellent for foods in which the butter is the star of the show, like Alfredo or anything with browned butter. I was also buying Pompeiian Robust extra virgin olive oil instead of Great Value for the same reason, but now I'm trying EVOOs that are in glass bottles. I'm trying this Terra Delyssa kind now, which seems alright, but the flavor is more mild (and I like a robust flavor).  \n\nIf you're making something like chocolate covered strawberries, Ghirardelli chocolate chips are superior to the Great Value ones. They have better flavor and are less waxy, and seem to coat the fruit more easily.\n\nFor anything cranberry, Ocean Spray is the way to go. I like diet cranberry juice, and the Great Value and other off-brands are sweeter than Ocean Spray. I personally prefer the tartness instead. The cranberry sauce is great, too, though I've also liked Great Value's.\n\nNow, on the other hand, there are certain generic brand things I actually prefer over the name brand. I like Great Value brand Tuna/Hamburger Helper and boxed mac and cheese better than the name brands, and the Fruit Smiles are my favorite fruit snacks and have been for 25+ years (excluding the ones made from late 2023 to either late last year or early this year, where they changed the recipe and they were awful for a while; but thanks, Wal-Mart, for changing it back! If only they'd do that with the Scooby ones now).\n\nOh, and if you shop at Aldi at all, apparently their Specially Selected pasta sauces are the same formula as Rao's, but they're about half the price. I've tried them and can't tell the difference (and having also tried Carbone, I think it tastes very similar). Their versions of Pasta Roni (I think the brand is Regano?) are pretty good, too.",

They have so many fillers & preservatives in them that they are rarely gluten free. Not a huge deal for most people, but do you want food, or do you want fillers & preservatives?  And do you want gluten in every food you eat? Gluten is healthy for most people, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to eat so much of it!\n\nTypically the big chain store's OWN brand foods are almost identical to the brand name, or even better, as far as not having extra fillers/preservatives & having similar ingredients to the name brand. Celiacs love store-brand rice-crispies which rarely have gluten, but name brand Rice-Crispies do. \n\nTwo that I have noticed specifically; WalMart brand plain frozen veggies which should have a single ingredient carry a gluten warning. Probably cross contamination, but seriously? Give us clean frozen veggies. We don't want chicken nuggets crumbs in our food. \nSam's club \"Cheerios\" were so bad that my kids wouldn't eat them. The dog was not a fan & had to be tricked into eating them. I put them in a birdfeeder,  but the birds flung them to the ground where even the squirrels were not impressed & they just dissolved over time. The grass didn't seem to mind.
