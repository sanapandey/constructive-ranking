You got to consider it takes a loooong time to heat that amount.\nI had a pot with about 270 l. I took roughly 8 hours to boil the water (2/3 filled). Obviously, it depends on the stove.\n\nI would suggest soups in general and lentil soup in specific. Dont reheat. The amount of Food takes too long to cool down and will spoil over night.
