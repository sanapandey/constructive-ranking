    "selftext": "I am on a weight loss journey right now... well more of a \"be healthier\" journey but tomato tomato. Either way, I am craving protein after now going to the gym 5 days a week every week.\n\nSo, in my protein craving state I bought two cartons of eggs. Turns out: I hate eggs. Sunny side up, fried, scrambled, quiche, stir fried with rice, egg sandwiches. I've tried them all. So now here I am with still over a dozen eggs left and I need recipe ideas. \n\nEggs now being worth their weight in gold and me needing a good source of protein for breakfast, I'm turning to you guys in the hopes someone can give me  \"this is how I hide eggs in my toddlers food\" ideas. Thanks! \n\nEDIT: thank you all so much! I have so many great ideas from you all that I might have to buy another carton to try them all!",

                            "body": "As a general rule when eating foods that are less nutrient dense, it helps to focus on ADDING foods (rather than subtracting) to round out your meal and make sure you are filling yourself up and keeping yourself satiated. Here are my suggestions for french toast:\n\n1) Top your french toast with a hot fruit compote (I prefer using frozen berries, which are high in sugar but also uniquely high in nutrients like antioxidants) and a dollop of yogurt (ideally unsweetened/plain whole milk - less sugar but still full fat to keep you full. I also like a plain full fat greek yogurt). The yogurt is great for a number of reasons. It will help fill you up with more protein and fats to round out all the carbs and sugars and help keep prevent a bloodsugar spike/sugar craving and it is a pro-biotic, which is good for your stomach bacteria and helps settle your stomach.\n\n2) The berries add sweetness, but if you feel like it needs a bit more (I sometimes do, depends), drizzle a bit of honey/maple syrup over everything. Or add some vanilla and a bit of honey/maple syrup to the yogurt, which will probably still be way less sugar than if you buy already sweetened yogurt. Reducing the sugar is less about eating less sugar, but rather dampening sugar cravings and not spiking your glucose/energy. I find that especially when I eat a lot of pastry in the morning, it really wrecks my body/mood for the rest of the day.\n\nThe next two recommendations are less important, and do involve substitutions/subtractions.\n\n3) Use sourdough bread which is easier to digest (because of the fermentation) than an enriched bread (like challah). Anyway, sourdough is a delicious, popular bread for french toast.\n\n4) It's up to you but imo sugar and cream are not necessary for the egg/milk mixture (sugar does help a little bit with the maillard reaction/browning but in my experience I haven't noticed a real difference in flavor/texture when I added cream and sugar). I do use lots of cinnamon (ant nutmeg) and some vanilla in my egg-milk mixture, which have some natural sweetness and add lots of flavor",

If you're like me, my advice is to stop forcing it and just find other sources of protein instead. Peanut butter is a pretty good source of both protein and fat (similar to eggs) if you get the natural stuff, and that's what I tend to use for any morning breakfasts instead of eggs.
