Your metaphor can be condensed into, \"It's a cry for attention which is something toddlers do.\" Wanting attention is not a symptom of mental illness, and it's a behavior consistent through all age groups.\n\nI can't really humor them \"looking like clowns,\" because the vast majority literally do not. There is way more to a clown than colored hair. It's a pretty consistent concept, so maybe do some research on clowns? You seem confused. There are plenty of people who have dyed their hair who have achieved your definition of important things. Companies not hiring someone for a trait doesn't mean their decision is rooted in truth.\n\nThe cult part is actually pretty funny, because you're so clueless that you've been indoctrinated. You're just looking at the CEOs you hear about regularly and concluding that if you're not like them then you're a failure. MAGA is a cult.\n\nYou didn't explain anything, lol.

It's 7 years old but is surely part of what is happening now.\n\nI've been a liberal crypto guy, predominantly interested in one particular project (not Solana), and had hopes that it was going to improve the world, not knowing anything about accelerationism, but in hindsight, I was  thinking along some of those tropes, especially more transparent governance through blockchain. But the alignment of the development teams ideas with trumpian politics and their use of the word \"accelerate\" and now knowing what that means has made me realise, blockchain is bad in the wrong hands - an automated way to implement inequality in a digital world.",

I don't think I could ever act in something like this, even if it was my job.\n\nOn an other note, I see how everyone here is calling it a bad take for an ad. I wonder if, even by repulsing most people, attracting a bit more MAGA fanatics could be profitable in the short term. Worst thing that could happen would be that folks already invested in it drop it all at once. But beside that, it must look *really* appealing to the target audience. Since Trump already used Solana to promote his own shitcoins, it might be a real strategy for Solana to go full MAGA and live off of that. Assuming they are totally apolitical or pro-Trump.\n\nIt's also a bold move in that it gives one more important point to compare themselves with the concurrents. Choosing a blockchain is not a matter of security, performance or decentralization anymore, it's a political thing (which is oddly contradictory with the message from that ad \\^\\^).",
