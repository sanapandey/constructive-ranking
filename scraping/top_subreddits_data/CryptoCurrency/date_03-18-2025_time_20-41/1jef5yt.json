Should i sell it and write it off as a loss or hold it in the hopes that someday it becomes worth something again? \n\nI'm pretty much assuming that it'll never be worth much and mentally I've already written off that money. What are yalls opinion on LRC? \n\nI've heard that they are still developing it and they actually have plans but without the GME hype it had, and the sea of crypto idk how they stand out. Kind of seems like only BTC is the worthwhile investment anymore. ",

            "body": "I mean...if you need the money then sure sell it. You won't turn profit on the investment, that's for sure. Maybe it can still do a 2x or something, at some point, maybe. Worst case scenario is you lose like what, $90 more? You've already lost 1900. \n\nTop tier memecoins are down 70-90% from ATH. I'd wait for the week to end, see how this thing unfolds. Then maybe put that 100 in something like PEPE/SPX6900/DOGE/TURBO/WIF/POPCAT or something else with a history, a community and...you know, the vibes. That's a guaranteed 2-6x next time they pump(depending on how this week and month end). I'd rather wait on either one of these than on LRC if I had to turn $100 into $200, that's for sure. Honestly, with this $100 I'd just open a 3-5x no stop-loss long on one of the memes when they finish dumping to a nice support. You've written it off already, might as well do that. It's $1900 loss at this point and the $100 is as good as gone anyway. Unless you actually need the money just leverage it on a meme lol",

Everyone was saying \"My body is ready\" and that's when I knew it was time to sell. I ended up losing about $2k on that because I bought it right back after someone bullshitted on one of the private forums, I forget which one, so I panic bought back in. $2k lesson. Don't fuck with alt coins, once you've made a halfway decent profit, get out and keep the cash in reserve and DCA into BTC over time.\n\nI wish I'd done that instead of buying all those alts, even if some of them were arguably good. BTC would have netted me well over $150k from a $25k investment had I actually bought it at around the bottom and sold around the top. What has anything else done for me? Oh, it was a cheaper solution, a cheaper price, a better project? Nope, nope and nope. BTC is the only way to get ahead and not have to worry about getting shaken up so much when there is a bit of a correction or a soft meltdown.",
