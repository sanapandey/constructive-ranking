You also want to know the common signs of phishing attacks such as misspelled domain names or email signatures, attachments from unknown senders, or messages that contain a sense of urgency or even threats of a legal nature that encourage you to click or download something.\n\nNever click on something that you aren\u2019t expecting or don\u2019t know what it is or who sent it and when in doubt, contact the sender in a separate message or email. If a domain name or URL seems suspicious then go to it directly by typing it into the browser window instead of by clicking on a link. You can also use a VPN to protect your privacy further and a password manager to keep your passwords safe.\n\nNew malware strains like this one are created everyday but by practicing good cyber hygiene and staying up to date on the latest attack methods, you can avoid falling victim to StilachiRAT and other online threats.\n\nhttps://www.tomsguide.com/computing/malware-adware/dangerous-new-password-stealing-trojan-automatically-reinstalls-itself-on-infected-pcs",

            "body": "For those wondering if you are affected and want to check, here are some steps (Instructed by AI):\n\n* Run a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus software. Some antivirus programs have specific detection names for StilachiRAT, such as Avast (Win64:MalwareX-gen \\[Trj\\]), Kaspersky (Backdoor.Win64.Agent.kxj), and Microsoft (TrojanSpy:Win64/Stilachi.A)\n* Monitor for unusual system behavior, including unexpected system reboots, suspicious outbound network connections, or unexplained changes to Windows registry values\n* Check for the presence of unfamiliar processes or services, particularly those with names similar to \"WWStartupCtrl64.dll\"\n* Look for unexpected cryptocurrency wallet extensions in your Chrome browser, as StilachiRAT targets 20 different wallet extensions\n* Be alert for any signs of credential theft, such as unexpected logins to your accounts or changes to saved passwords in Chrome\n* Use network monitoring tools to check for suspicious connections, especially on TCP ports 53, 443, or 16000, which StilachiRAT uses for communication\n* Examine your system and security logs for any signs of tampering or clearing, as StilachiRAT has the ability to clear event logs",
