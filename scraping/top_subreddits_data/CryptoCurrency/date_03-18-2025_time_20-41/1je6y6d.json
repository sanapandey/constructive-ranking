But I wanted to see some sort of progress over time, instead I look at the market and see nothing but stagnancy and regression. Our politicians around the country aren\u2019t helping. Prices aren\u2019t going down. Call me a Luddite because I\u2019m stuffing my losses under my mattress and forfeit my diamond hands. I\u2019m out boys. Good luck. And may the best man, or government, or celebrity win. \nEDIT: OOF. This rustled a lot of hopeful feathers. A lot of fever dreams. There have been some good points but I implore you to read the writing on the fucking walls. Be bullish. Fine. But let\u2019s see how this plays out in 3 months. Also please inbox me if you\u2019re willing to donate to my losses. Thank you. :) ",

It just hasn't seemed like it since the debasement has been so intense since the GFC.\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight up we've been in a deflationary period for more than a decade, which makes sense when you look at the technological adoption that occurred, and the generally low barriers to trade that were put in place in the 90s finally being fully realized.\n\nThe real question is, are we at an inflection point for that period?",

The fact we got a bull run before the election was amazing, but right now these current politicians that the main stream media likes to lie to everyone about and claim are Hitler actually are trying to fix the debt problem because we are in 37 trillion and the interest alone on that is higher than our defense budget\u2026\n\nBut you know, if you listen to the media enough you\u2019ll be fear mongered into selling and hating your life while blaming people and things for the problem that isn\u2019t even the truth.\n\nThe fact of the matter is back in 60s policies were made that chased all our manufacturing over seas and then those same countries tariff America more after taking all our jobs\u2026this wrecked the middle class. Following this they took the damn gold standard away and have created even more policies wrecking the middle class like DEI and green new gas, or the department of education which mainly normalized all these policies and taught rewritten history so people would forget.\n\nBack in the 50s before this we were producing 50% of the worlds goods and oils and we tariffed everyone else\u2026todays age the media and globalists will psyop everyone into thinking tariffs bad and orange man Hitler\u2026.yet you can\u2019t sit here and deny the fact that DOGE has actually found real corruption with our tax dollars\u2026\n\nAnd this leads me to the finale, our money is fake, everything about it since the gold standard was taken away made it fake. Every war for the last 30 years has been to keep the dollar as the reserve of the world, not because of what we have been told. They literally just print it anyway yet continue to tax the crap out of us, and we normalized this as well? And yet when we finally get a president that talks about all of this, all of a sudden he is Hitler and a BIGGG problem..\n\nWe are basically living in a fall of Rome situation, sponsored by the globalist EU, and instead of people knowing their history, they blame the current sitting politicians that have only been there a couple months\u2026makes sense.\n\nCombine this with the poison water, food, and medical supply and you now have a population thats easy to control and manipulate with IQs dropping quite a bit each generation.\n\nAnd if you refuse to believe anything I said, do a deep dive on it all, and don\u2019t use google to do so because they are also in on it. And most these socials since monetization now allows you to pay them monthly and pump money into all your posts, letting bots, politics, and the propaganda machine psyop all these platforms with their media attack campaigns and everyone falls for it. \n\nBut if I was any investor I\u2019d pay attention to how countries out there have been forming Bitcoin reserves and how America is the only one that hasn\u2019t, which is why a reserve is being talked about because if America does not they will get left behind. Just like how they wrecked themselves with the fake green new gas while China creates the world\u2019s biggest pollution and has flown ahead of us in everything\u2026meanwhile we are the only country that has been destroying ourselves over \u201cclimate change\u201d\u2026which is out of our control and not something we can do if the entire world doesn\u2019t do it too..\n\nTake care \u270c\ufe0f",
