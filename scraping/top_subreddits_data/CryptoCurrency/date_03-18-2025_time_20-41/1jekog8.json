The whale's $450M trades with 50x leverage have shaken the crypto market, causing investor panic and efforts to uncover their identity. ZachXBT ruled out ties to North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group and hinted at further investigations into the whale's actions, which could reveal more about their impact on decentralized finance and market stability.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Still, many complain, claiming the whale has insider information or knows something we don\u2019t. If you truly believe he has an edge and can profit from it, just follow his trades.",
