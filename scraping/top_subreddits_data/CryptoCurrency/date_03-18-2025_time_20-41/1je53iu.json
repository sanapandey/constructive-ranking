            "body": "tldr; Solana faced backlash for its controversial 'America is Back \u2014 Time to Accelerate' ad, which was criticized for its divisive and politically charged content. The ad depicted a man rejecting 'woke' ideologies and embracing innovation, drawing mixed reactions. After deleting the ad, Solana faced further criticism for attempting to erase the controversy. Some viewed the ad as poor judgment, while others speculated it was a calculated marketing move. Solana has not commented on the matter.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.",

Half of it fails in the first year. \n\nSolana is/was one of the big places people went to make pump and dump memecoins on the cheap, and now it looks like it's being overtaken by Binance - one of the other big places - in terms of transaction volume so those days might also be done for them. It is just transaction volume though so maybe it'll just depend on those new... projects... It's more likely it'll be the next big pump and dump scheme but time will tell, right?\n\nThe best coin/project out there is Algorand, at least in regards to scalability, security, and stability (the trilemma)... but nobody gives a shit about that.\n\nThe best network 'doing things' I'd argue is Polkadot because it's more focused on interchain operability and connecting that to real world applications, but again, no one really gives a shit about that, because the current atmosphere has been poisoned by pump and dump schemes mainly coming from the Solana and Binance networks. \n\nI tell you what though, I'll do some more research.
