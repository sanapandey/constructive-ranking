                            "body": "Well, I'm starting my DCA into BTC in the not too distant future when finances are looking in better shape. But I have no time for anything else. Because unlike the overwhelming majority of crypto, BTC is actually a commodity - a virtual form of gold in a most portable form.\n\nIt hurts to think that, less than 3 years ago, considerably less than 3 years ago, I had $50k that I could have parked into 2 BTC, and today would be well over $200,000 Australian dollars and was, would you believe, over $300,000 Australian dollars just a short while ago. It hurts to think about it because I could have helped my family and friends. I don't care about money as much as some would believe. But having a nice little nest egg to help my family in times of real need would make me feel a lot better knowing that I wouldn't feel \"useless\" in my own terms, if I say so myself. Having a spare 300k would make me useful.\n\nAnd it turns out being useful is what gives me self-worth. Feeling useless makes me feel worthless.\n\nSo I'm doing to slowly DCA into BTC, and I'm going to hold it for as long as I need to, just to ensure that someone else, other than myself, can actually have their needs met. I don't care about my own needs. There are times that people tell me to start looking after number one, but then what? I have a litany of health problems, and money is never going to solve any of them, not ever, so I think the best thing I can do with that money is to store it, invest it, and ensure that it grows, so that if someone in my family is really doing it tough, I can do something to help them out in a material sense.\n\nAnd this now brings me to my Ethereum \"October 2015\" regret, my oh so biggest regret. I could have so easily snared $10k worth of ETH back then, I could have snared even $15k worth of ETH. How much would that have been at the peak? I'd presume somewhere between 40 and 60 million conservatively. I cannot imagine how helpful I would be if I had that much money to my name, if I were a cash rich multimillionaire. Feeling great about being able to lift the people I give a shit about out of bad situations, bad relationships, bad circumstances.\n\nBut alas, here I am, with not much but the shirt on my back. Sure, I have food and shelter, and clothes to wear, so I guess that's a damn sight better than what a lot of people in underdeveloped countries have.\n\nAs for being rich, well, that's not really a yardstick, it's more of a relative thing. In the land of the homeless, someone who has a roof over their head is rich. In the land of the starving, he who has food on the table is rich. In the land of the naked and barefoot, he who is clothed and has shoes to wear is rich. Rich indeed.\n\nIt's not about money, it's about where you stand among the rest of us. If you have something that most of us don't, then you are damned rich. Simple as that.",
