            "body": "tldr; A Coinbase and EY-Parthenon survey of 352 institutional investors reveals strong bullish sentiment on cryptocurrency, with 83% planning to increase allocations in 2023. By 2025, 59% aim to allocate over 5% of their assets to crypto. Stablecoins, DeFi, and tokenized assets are driving adoption, with DeFi engagement expected to triple by 2027. Regulatory clarity is seen as key to further growth, though concerns about regulation, volatility, and custody persist. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins like XRP and Solana remain popular among institutional portfolios.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Late January, when things were riding high, as opposed to anywhere in the last 2 months when they've dropped off a cliff...",
