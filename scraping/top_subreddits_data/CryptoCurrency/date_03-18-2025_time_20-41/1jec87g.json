    "selftext": "Did you know crypto.com and their CEO Kris have a long and full history of fraud and outright scams? With the CEO and CFO of crypto.com both having been investigated for fraud at a company they previously ran called ENSOGO, and the CDC exchange itself was financed by defrauding their ICO investors just a year later.\n\n* **Part 1: crypto.com, Kris, and a brief history of fraud and scams**\n* **Part 2: crypto.com just scammed CRO holders**\n* **Part 3: crypto.com is most likely secretly insolvent**\n\n\\---------\n\n# Part 1: crypto.com, Kris, and a brief history of fraud and scams\n\n**Ensogo:**\n\nBefore crypto.com Kris Marszalek was the CEO of Ensogo (a Groupon copycat) that defrauded investors, and third parties. Kris would resign as CEO and run away from the problem ultimately leaving an insolvent company that cost everyone else a lot of money. [More reading on Ensogo can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jf8bx4/history_of_kris_cryptocoms_ceo/). If for some reason you believe it couldn't be the same person [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzlJZectBY) of Kris shilling how great Ensogo is and how you should work for Ensogo just nine months before Ensogo declared bankruptcy in June of 2016.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hvcm7h9phpe1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=9126ff5d094ca6d319d5e90b9b23bfbda36ddfe0\n\n**Monaco:**\n\nJust eleven months after Kris defrauded investors and users at Ensogo, Kris was back with another ~~revolutionary~~ idea, well a **copycat** of another popular idea. Whereas Ensogo attempted to compete with an established competitor (Groupon). Monaco (MCO) attempted to be the first to get in early into a budding field, Crypto Credit Cards.\n\nKris raised $26M on an ICO for an ERC-20 token called Monaco with plans to launch a Crypto credit card with special rewards for Monaco holders, although plans for this would ultimately stall with no signs of success, Kris would pivot a year later and use his remaining reserves to buy the crypto.com [domain for $12M](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17540818/crypto-com-domain-matt-blaze-monaco-mco-cryptology-sale). This would lead to Monaco being renamed \"crypto.com\" token and then later being abandoned altogether for a new token called CRO. In 2020 Monaco holders were given a limited amount of time to exchange their MCO for CRO (a new token in which CDC owned nearly all the supply) and at a suboptimal rate. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)\n\n>To sum up this long tale, Monaco (MCO) raised tens of millions of dollars to launch a cryptocurrency Visa card... The company rebranded itself by buying the $12 million Crypto.com website and renamed Monaco (MCO) to Crypto.com, likely due to numerous users calling Monaco (MCO) a scam. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)\n\n**The crypto.com credit card debate:**\n\nAfter defrauding Monaco investors to buy the crypto.com domain, Kris would eventually launch a crypto credit card. Forcing credit card holders to buy CRO from crypto.com and lock it up to get rewards for holding the credit card. Kris repeated one of his tricks from his days at Ensogo, offering rewards that are too good to be true to onboard new users, then pull those rewards and create unhappy users.\n\n\\* For the crypto.com credit card it worked like this:\n\nSell your freshly minted CRO to Users (at no cost to yourself) -> Have them lock up their CRO for a year to get a credit card with \"great\" rewards, dripping the money they gave you back to them -> after a significant number of users are onboarded pull those rewards -> Leave unhappy users to deal with the consequences.\n\nMany users purchased a Credit Card locking up hundreds of thousands of CRO to get rewards, had those rewards slashed - and a year later the value of the token they locked up had lost 75%-90% of it's value costing users thousands to hundreds of thousands.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nPart 1 doesn't cover many sketchy things that crypto.com does like: hosting fake \"giveaways\", and taking advantage of new crypto investors with a \"gamified\" experience that **steals 15% of your money** with spread every time you make a full trade.\n\n\\---------------\n\n# Part 2: crypto.com just scammed CRO holders\n\nWhen crypto.com first launched CRO they minted 100B tokens, before eventually burning 70B tokens in 2021 (as a gimmick) [and said the final supply was 30B. ](https://cryptobriefing.com/70-billion-cro-burned-ahead-crypto-org-chain-launch/)On March 2nd 2025, just four years after the \"burn\" CDC made a proposal to remint the 70B tokens that they previously \"burned\" and to give it to themselves without making it clear how it would be used.\n\nThis proposal was put up to a \"democratic vote\" where nearly every user that wasn't CDC rejected the proposal. CDC proceeded to wait until the day before voting closed to steamroll the proposal - with CDC controlling 48% of the voting power and only 70% of validators voting this was all but guaranteed to pass and CDC will be minting 70B in CRO currently worth $5B to give to themselves, devaluing existing CRO holders.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fiyrftkffhpe1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a4c61fc6a881908e9c15a54597e86171d84c5e\n\nIn yet another attempt at manipulation immediately after CDC forced the remint of 70B tokens, they made another proposal to burn 50M tokens which they will surely pass for optics.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.mintscan.io\\/crypto-org\\/proposals\\/30](https://preview.redd.it/tnrru669ghpe1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ecd7d2ea1cb7c547515b0c461256c8caea3f1b)\n\nSo in other words instead of minting 70B Cro, they're just minting 69.95B Cro...\n\nKris was mostly silent to the backlash but a few days after the proposal went live they would eventually make one of their only statements saying they needed to mint 70B tokens to create sustainable flows on the \"demand side\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdg2yf00hhpe1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=8898f1383813d26d6f4a4d9edb9be68a450414f8\n\nOr in other words, CRO needed 70B tokens so that they could sell them to third parties for pure profit at no cost to themselves, diluting the value of all existing CRO holders who may want to sell. An absolute garbage excuse for anyone who knows how \"Crypto and Demand of Alts\" actually works.\n\nThis is completely contrary to what CDC said they would do in their white paper, use exchange profits to purchase additional CRO, creating an ecosystem where exchange profits are redistribute to CRO holders.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ukzivkwhhpe1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=c345b611d1549fd59991bae0173fa6606f832d0c\n\n\\---------\n\n# Part 3: crypto.com is likely secretly insolvent\n\nThe question becomes why is Crypto.com abandoning their white paper to scam CRO holders, the simple answer is CDC just wants to mint more \"rewards\" for their users at no cost to themselves, but I think the truth is something much darker... crypto.com is likely secret insolvent.\n\nAfter FTX collapsed CDC seemed like it would be another exchange to fall given CDCs staking feature and similar business model. CDC survived a smaller exchange run and would eventually release an audit in early December, but just days later the firm that ran it said they weren't confident with the audits and would stop running them since they didn't show liabilities.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.investopedia.com\\/mazars-suspends-crypto-clients-6931106](https://preview.redd.it/1g880c2clhpe1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=68995b30dcfaa155b2dc469853bb03b4846503f2)\n\nCrypto.com hasn't had an audit since, **in fact a post from a week ago asking why CDC hasn't had an audit since 2022 and has since been deleted or removed from** r/crypto_com\n\nGiven the fact that CDC is now blowing up what's left of their reputation to mint $5B it raises even more questions, why would CDC blow up what's left of their reputation? Ensogo did not have a money printer feature to save the company that Kris could use to prevent the company from going under when he ran it into the ground... crypto.com does and we already know that CDC leadership does not have a good track record with actually leading a company.\n\nOne of the only things Kris has attempted to repeatedly respond to since this drama began in early March is to aggressively assure users that CDC doesn't have any problems. While continuing to ignore any questions asking for a firm plan of how CDC will use the 70B CRO that they're reminting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ur2wv9gnhpe1.jpg?width=592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff3c15453b434c0034ffdd10c17d265060a57cee\n\nKris went out of his way to try and tell users that all of these claims that CDC might be in trouble are \"just falsehoods\", but they're using the emergency built in money printer feature of their platform, they aren't releasing an audit, and their leadership has a very bad history of running companies into the ground\n\nSo it other words:\n\n* If a homeowner has a long history of catching his prior homes on fire\n* He won't let you look at the home to verify it's not on fire\n* The homeowners is aggressively telling people that there is no fire\n* He's rushing loads of water to his home\n* He isn't telling you why he needs the water\n\n**The house is probably on fire and you probably want to get your money out of CDC.**\n\nThat is the state of CDC at the moment. **There is no smoking gun because CDC isn't letting people see what's going on** by refusing to do more audits, but everything points to CDC likely being at least partially insolvent, and UNTIL THEY DO AN AUDIT YOU SHOULD ASSUME THEY ARE. (don't trust verify)\n\nThe two thing that might save CDC from going under in a bankrun is their insane fees to take money from the platform and the fact that they encourage users to lock up their funds on the platform which will hide the full extent of the damage by preventing many users from withdrawing during a bankrun (probably what helped save them in 2022).\n\nWho knows though, CDC has a plan to mint $5B and give it to themselves. If that works in a few years they might be able to dig themselves out of any hole that they may or may not currently be in.",

If you're truly not an employee think about what CDC is doing and what reasons they could have for doing it, and the radio silence for what's going on. Hint it's not that they \"need more liquidity\" that's not how crypto works. the CRO supply was almost 150x as high as the bitcoin supply and Bitcoin got an ETF. The circulating supply increase was only need to give CDC a way to print money.\n\nOn top of that ask yourself why CDC hasn't done an audit since Dec. 2022 and why they won't do an audit that shows their liabilities. \n\nOccam's razor says they're insolvent.

To make changes to the contract they must first issue a gonvernance vote that every Cro owner can vote on. Yeah they control most of the votes through their CDC validators, but it is completely wrong to say that \"they own the contract\" or could mint another 200T. They don't own anything, just the majority of votes as all CDC cashback card stakes are on the CDC validators. You cannot \"own\" a blockchain contract that uses a governance system \ud83d\ude02\n\nFuthermore no, burnt tokens are not wiped from existance. They still exist, but on a wallet that you promise to never touch again and no one else can access either. This is what CDC changed with their V5 proposal. They will lay hands on this wallet again and send 1b Cro to their vesting/reserve wallet each month.\n\nAgain this shows how little you know about crypto. You think a burnt token or coin doesn't exist anymore but that is just wrong. It still exists but no one can access it anymore.\n\nSo please Mr. obviously uneducated crypto Redditor, show me the receipts. Where is the data that indicates that CDC is close to being bankrupt?
