Pre Trump it was a printing machine - take on debt, buy Bitcoin - Bitcoin goes up and he looks like a genius- repeat process. Now it feels like an MLM sales pitch and he's trying to keep the momentum even though the tide is turning. This push to inject huge sums of government money feels exactly like what the bailout was. Which is really ironic. Now if they move Bitcoin completely into the hands of the rich, while using public funds to \"legitimize\" it and make it \"work\" (steal) - what the was the point of it?",

Now they come back to the market with different terms, because obviously daddy needs his dry powder.\n\nWhat is the market demanding? \"Declared regular dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock will be payable solely in cash.\u00a0\" We don't want your shares anymore Michael. Also there's quarterly payments with heavy penalties for missed payments compounding up to 18%; Saylor's credit rating seems to be going down among smart money. Lastly, the liquidation price is dynamically set as price rises, with any potential dilliution through ATM not counting against it. \n\nThe dynamic liquidation price is the most telling aspect; doing a surprise ATM on the STRK product whose main \"feature\" was a $1000 perpetual strike clearly ruffled some feathers. it looks like institutional investors are only gonna play ball if he gives them significant protections against dillution\n\nClaude AI had an unusually prescient observation: \"The name \"Perpetual Strife\" seems almost like a nod to the tension between the company's capital-raising needs and investor protection concerns. It's an unusually direct acknowledgment of the conflict inherent in the structure.\"",

A week later, he calls his broker to get a quote. Pleased to learn that the price per contract has risen to 35 cents, he decides to buy another 1,000 contracts. A few days later, eager to check on the progress of his investment, he is amazed to learn that the price has now risen to 50 cents per contract, twice the price he paid for his original 100 contracts. Sensing a trend, he steps it up, this time buying 100,000 contracts. The next day, ecstatic to learn that the price per contract has now risen to 65 cents, he gets even more aggressive, buying 1,000,000 contracts. Sure enough, the following day, the price per contract rises to 95 cents, prompting him to order an additional million contracts. The day after that, as rising prices further validate his intuition, he buys yet another million contracts, this time paying $1.25.\n\nThe next day, with egg contracts trading at $1.75, he senses that the market has risen too far too fast, and places an order to sell 2,000,000 contracts. After a pregnant pause, his broker replies, \"Sell to whom, you're the egg man!\"",

Saylor's model assumes 29% yoy growth. When Bitcoin was $100, this was possible. Now that it's a 1.5 trillion dollar asset, that's really only possible if the dollar inflated at like 15% or something. Bitcoin calls to hedge and wait for the greatest fools to start drying up.",
