Let's take a look at all Moon Burns between February 3rd and March 2nd.\u00a0The rCryptoCurrency TG channel is also funding a 3,000 Moon Giveaway you can find out how to enter (within the first 48 hours) at the end of this post[.](https://imgur.com/a/10Jb44H)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ioks4xk7nhoe1.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=df8e909a7ed056dcfa0406e3ef1dadc7bb3f35c8\n\n# What are Moons:\n\nFor the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:\n\n* Earning Moons for participation on the sub.\u00a0[(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)\n* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).\n* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).\n* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of\u00a0[events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)\n* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit.\n\nOne of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days. You can find the Moon Week 59 post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j5f6tn/moon_week_59/)\n\n# Let's talk Moon Week 59 Moon Burns:\n\nBetween February 3rd and March 2nd\n\n* 38,632 Moons were\u00a0[burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)\u00a0in five unique burn events:\n* 229,145 Moons were\u00a0[burned on Arbitrum One\u00a0](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in thirteen unique burn events:\n* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is:\u00a0267,777 Moons.\n\n# Moon Burn Ranking Update:\n\nMoons are the 10th most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum One\u00a0**(up one since the** [**last update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1is1amf/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_58_moon_burn_update/)**)**\u00a0with \\~382k Moons having been burned so far on Arbitrum One\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ao9xny3phoe1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=a18785cf71b6489ae3b89adfb45512a8f8c69c22\n\nUnlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the sole supply of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned by web three entities looking to host AMAs or customize the rCC banner.\n\n\\-----\n\nMoons remain the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \\~2.95M Moons having been burned to date and accounting for over 99.9% of the value of all tokens in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knjkxm0aphoe1.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=af05fea2e88c83c6dae4289887779ff735bc907e\n\nThe Moon Week 57 burn update introduced a way to win 500 Moons by guessing how many Moons will be burned in 2025? If you haven't already guessed you have until April 1st to leave a guess - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i0o8mz/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_57_moon_burn_update/).\n\n\\----\n\n# An rCryptoCurrency Community Funded Giveaway\n\nThe rCryptoCurrency TG channel raised an additional 3,000 Moons to be given away on this Moon Burn update post. (last post they gave away 1,500 Moons) To win a share, all you have to do is go to the pinned comment on this post and leave your KrakTag (for Kraken Pay). After 48 hour the Giveaway Fund (currently 3,000 Moons) will be split evenly via Kraken Pay among everyone that entered.\n\n\\----\n\n*p.s. Did you know you can buy Moon themed Merch?* [*https://ccmoons.com/shop*](https://ccmoons.com/shop) *- Shop is ran by* u/002_timmy *and any after tax profit will be used to buy and burn Moons.*",
