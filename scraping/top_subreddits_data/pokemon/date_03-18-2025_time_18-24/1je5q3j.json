I\u2019m 26 now and I\u2019ve got a bookshelf full of Mega, as well as an entire world filled with the little guys. I\u2019m honestly quite sad to see Mega Pokemon ending, as I feel what they do with brick building toys is way more of a better fit for something like Pokemon over Lego. Mega only uses prints, which granted Lego has begun to do more of, especially with gaming sets. But beyond that you have the unique parts Mega has that Lego doesn\u2019t and Mega\u2019s willingness to make specialized parts when they feel necessary. Those elements go a *long* way to making so many buildable creatures look good. Time will tell, but I just do not see what Lego does with Pokemon being any better than what Mega did. But everyone will cheer anyone because \u201cLego good, Mega bad\u201d",

Just pure speculation on my part, I would think they would also do brick built Pok\u00e9mon as well as opposed to minifig scale which many are hoping for because having it be in minifig scale would require countless new custome moulds and/or prints and I don\u2019t think they would translate well in that scale or being based off the mini figure body with custom heads for example. I would think they would want to minimize the number of new parts/colours and go the 3-in-1 animal/creature scale as they would be more utility and versatility with the parts being introduced and limit the number of new unique moulds. Also at the end of the day Lego is a building toy company so they would want their consumers to build and minifig scale Pok\u00e9mon doesn\u2019t really allow that other than side builds or buildings which I don\u2019t think should be a big focus here, it should be about the Pok\u00e9mon themselves.\n\nAs for my own personal feelings, I\u2019m excited and glad they finally partner together but I am a bit unsure what I will do as there may be a significant drop in interest for my builds/designs. I still have some builds I plan to share still but when this line/theme releases I\u2019m not sure.",

Minifig scale would mean like 1/2 the pokemon in existence would be the size of the minifig legs and require their own molds. And even the medium size pokemon that are the size of a human would need their own molds. It's just not going to happen.\n\nI'm not upset by that at all, I *LOVE* brick-built creatures. I don't build in minifig scale at all myself either.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, do you rely on your MOCs for a living or is it just a hobby?",
