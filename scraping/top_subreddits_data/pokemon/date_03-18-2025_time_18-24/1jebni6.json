I like that explanation, it implies that legendary/mythical Pok\u00e9mon willingly come with you and that they could hypothetically break free from your control if they wanted to. Because it seems a bit silly that the player character could forcibly capture creatures like Arceus, Regigigas, the lake trio, etc.",
