For water moves, it's Water Pulse and Whirpool and that's it and it learns Whirlpool late.\n\nIt also evolves at Level 31, which is quite late for such a low-BST mon.\n\nIt's basically Sinnoh's answer to Goldeen and Seaking and those aren't good mons either. However, Finneon & Lumineon are nearly always in the \"top most forgettable\" tier-lists on YouTube, which has kind of made it... not so forgettable nowadays.",
