Bionicle is just too niche. Like you said, for it to do ok it needs an entire dedicated team to create all the media for it beyond just the sets themselves. It\u2019s simply not worth it to do all that for mediocre sales when most of lego\u2019s lineup does not require external media, and when it does it has a much bigger general audience than bionicle (ninjago).\n\nBionicle either way is not worth the effort to make a 3rd resurgence for, no matter how you slice it. You have rose tinted glasses.\n\nAlso lego ip partnership is always better than a fake lego ip partnership.",
