Not only that is also the angle of the hand, the finger and palm posistion. \n\nSo if an A.I is smart enough, they could just crop out the hand in each art work and use their own hand in their imahe libary.\n\nOr...learn to draw in the first place.",

                                    "body": "I know nobody will actually care, but the real reason is because generative diffusion models produce images that emerge from random noise, not from any underlying structure or 'sketch'. So when it's generating features in an image, it's basically just using a statistical model to predicting what each pixel is based on other nearby pixels at a very small level.\n\nA good way to think about it is that in pictures, fingers are usually next to other fingers, so the AI isn't thinking _\"okay I need five fingers\"_, but rather _\"okay, this pixel is part of a finger, that means another finger must be nearby so this other random pixel might also be part of a finger\"._\n\nThat explains exactly why you can get too many, or too few fingers - it's considering each pixel semi-independently. So you might generate \"parts\" of 6+ fingers before those parts are joined together into a hand shape.\n\nThis problem tends to happen more on features that have details that are close together, or which are passing behind another object in the scene, because the AI isn't considering the image as a whole but rather individual parts.",

Fingers statistically tend to be next to other fingers, so it may generate too many fingers before it finishes generating the rest of the hand.",
