There's a lot of Catholic Priests I've talked to that made it abundantly clear that it's meant to be a guideline, not a stict 'do this or burn in hell forever' book. And some even teach the paradoxes, explaining that these paradoxes exist BECAUSE of the control mechanisms that were baked in for various purposes over the centuries.\n\nThe hardest part about religion is knowing when NOT to throw the baby out with the bathwater.",

If something contradicts the word of Christ, it has to be plucked out.  And even some of those portions (or direct quotations) are somewhat suspect.  There's room for interpretation in a lot of it -- but there are just as many areas where there is *no* room for interpretation, and one of those is that his followers should try to treat everyone with empathy and compassion and kindness.",

Since there's no method to extract evidence past death, then there's no method to confirm nor deny the existence of an afterlife.

Even if all you get out of it is feeling good about yourself, isn't that enough? \n\nFor the record, that quote is accurate, in my view. Not because it discounts the possibility of a heaven or afterlife, but because it underscores how religions is built and used as a form of control, while the various religious texts that support it are either intentionally misinterpreted, or combined with contradictory texts that encourage behaviors that make control easier to be done over you when applied.",

In this way knowledge is transmitted and effects a population much the same way that genes are, and similarly to genes they can be subject to natural selection based on how adaptive they are to the environment or the population.  \n\nI think this dates to the 70s or maybe early 80s?  It's worth looking into, some really interesting ideas there.",

If you weren't born in the 80's and weren't a dumb-fascist-bonehead it can be confusing.  \n9/11 basically made it impossible to get rid of these guys. For a long time the anti-fascist movement was strong and militant. They showed up to threatened businesses and fought the fascist gangs that wanted to firebomb them. Once 9/11 happened anyone wanting to protect a person a shade darker than beige would be classified as a terrorist.  \nNow its much worse. ICE is the evolution of the Posse Comitatus, a Nazi hate group that spread and fought SHARP through much of America's heartland. After POS C was defeated on the streets they took to American Republican politics and internet forums like 4chan and regained a foothold like the bastards they are. Much of this history is erased from American history because it implicates many of the people in power now.",

This allows a juvenile animal to grow up more effectively, without having to expose themselves to as much danger.\n\nI don't think this simple type of empathy is unique to humans. However, humans are also capable of incredible depths of empathy, which wouldn't be possible without language or complex reasoning. It's so central to the human experience that I wouldn't be surprised if the development of deeper empathy is one of the evolutionary fitness goals that caused our species to develop more language skills and the ability to perform complex reasoning.\n\nSo, then, when you look at fascism, and how it treats outsiders, calling them \"subhuman\" or \"vermin\", I think the hypocrisy really stands out. Forget \"subhuman\". A person without empathy is really even lower than a lot of animals out there.",

Apparently this is a common belief now with many American megachurches. Being flashy and wealthy is a sign that God has blessed you. Being poor and destitute is a sign that God is punishing you. And wanting to help the poor and destitute is a temptation by Satan. Or some bullshit like that.",

I think the main line thinking is that over empathizing can lead to accepting someone else's view as true, and if that person is a sinner you may begin to hold sinful thoughts in your head. Therefore you should sympathize with a sinner and not empathize with them.\n\n\nCombining this with prosperity gospel: poor people are poor because they aren't faithful, and while it may be good to help them it is bad to understand them.",

But compared to other Space Marine chapters, The 18th Legion, the Salamanders, are considered the closest thing to good guys in Warhammer.\n\nExcerpt from the WH40K Salamanders wiki:   \n\"The Salamanders are unusually concerned with civilian casualties compared to most other Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes and believe that one of their most important duties is to protect the lives of the Emperor of Mankind's innocent subjects whenever and wherever possible. This is an attitude that developed as a consequence of the Salamanders' own unusually close connections to the Nocturnean people, as they are one of the only Chapters of Astartes who continue to interact with their mortal families and the people of their homeworld after their transformation into Space Marines.\n\nFor instance, it is not uncommon for a Salamander to live among the Nocturneans in special Chapter bastions created within each of their homeworld's seven tribal \"Sanctuary Cities\" when Chapter business does not require him to remain at the Chapter's fortress-monastery on Nocturne's moon of Prometheus, and certainly the Salamanders are looked upon as leaders within their communities. The Salamanders and their people as a whole are also defined by their adherence to a variation of the Imperial Cult called the Promethean Cult.\"  \n\nThough that's not to say they are not without their own atrocities, considering their afinity for fire.",

America has been molded into a place where elections lean in these asshats favor because they've deliberately abused the system in a fashion that gives them innate advantages in elections.  Congress has chose the current state of affairs, and Congress is gerrymandered to hell to produce these results.\n\nIt's like blaming the team for a points shaving scandal involving a single player.

The reason why it's so obvious now is because the current billionaire class is filled with a small amount of somewhat clever creeps and a lot of very greedy morons.\n\nElon is on camera heavily hinting that he was gonna rig this past election, whomever owns the Republican party is letting a chaotic entity make moves that will eventually galvanize the whole population by making life miserable for everyone. While the Democrats are mostly owned by corporations that have stacked the Congress with inconsequential stooges.\n\nAs of right now we have damn near less than ten politicians actively saying out loud what's wrong and trying their damnedest to fix it. States are experiencing actual disasters with no news coverage and no government assistance making the effort to assist (West Virginia just recently got flooded bad!) and \"high status\" individuals being executed with the general public approving of the action.\n\nProtests are becoming more frequent which is nice however like what some people are speculating I too feel that there is going to be a rather violent consequence for the actions of our current ruling class. This goal of privatizing everything isn't tenable. Private prisons and for-profit prisons never get brought up but once the people become upset enough to take physical actions then every issue will be taken into account when we the people decide what to do.\n\nI just pray it doesn't result in too much blood shed.

Assume they do all they say they want to, and end entitlements entirely. No more Social Security, Medicaid, Disability, etc.\n\nWhat are all of those millions of Americans that are too elderly or infirm supposed to do? There is a substantial population of Americans that rely on government programs to survive. Literally survive. So if they take away all of those entitlements, either the states step up their entitlement programs or these people just...die. Can you imagine a state like Alabama stepping up entitlements to close the gap? Neither can I, and I live here.\n\nSo here is where the \"sin of empathy\" rhetoric comes in. They are laying the groundwork for people to watch these mass deaths without revolting against their masters.\n\nPart of me think this is the tip of the spear for a population culling. Look, as long as there have been classes in society, the aristocracy has railed against the filthy plebeians getting any resources allocated to them. The \"parasite class\" in their thoughts, and certainly not worth any empathy. However, the plebeians have always been essential in a way, doing the work that no one else would.\n\nHowever, this time around there is a wildcard. Most, if not all, menial jobs will be soon automated with AI and robotics. Doesn't matter if this is based in real fact or not, if Musk and company believe it and are shaping the world around it. So, run small businesses and farmers into bankruptcy, megacorps buy up all the assets and replace the workers with AI-run robots and let all of the suddenly extraneous lower and lower-middle class folks kill each other and starve to death.\n\nThen there is less competition for resources, less needs to be allocated to the filthy poors, and there is no drop in goods and services thanks to the robots. More money for a trip to Mars by the way.\n\nLogically, if most menial jobs will soon be replaced by AI and robotics, there are only two options for the displaced worker class. Provide a Universal Basic Income, or let them die. Which option do you think will appeal to the current administration? If many people \"commit the sin of empathy\" then this whole plan falls apart, hence the foundational groundwork being laid here.",

Such as improving your good name or the pshycic profit made from charity. Which means you value being charitable higher than to not be. If you are being altruistic you are doing it knowing you will feel worse off afterwards.\n\nHope that clears it up.",
