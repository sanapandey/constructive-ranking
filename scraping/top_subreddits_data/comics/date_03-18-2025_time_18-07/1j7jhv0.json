    "selftext": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whomp!\n\n  \nWhomp! is a long-running webcomic by Ronnie Filyaw which was on hiatus the past three years and now has made a triumphant return. \n\n  \nThe comic centers around the life and antics of the overweight, junk-food-obsessed and socially inept nerd Ronnie, who is a fictionalized version of the author and features such recurring themes as self-depreciating comedy, absurdism, magical realism, cats and his father is Santa Claus (no, really.) (It is not a good thing.)\n\n  \nHere at r/Comics we are very happy to see new Whomp! comics being published and wanted to give a shout-out. \n\n  \nYou can start reading the new strips here:\n\n  \n[https://www.whompcomic.com/comic/the-return-1](https://www.whompcomic.com/comic/the-return-1)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8905bwvapqne1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b2503ea289848c2e0c94ff2d2a010a541db8574\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhon537epqne1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f268b159b35fdf2ed7173080624b9ca863e68312\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lbeh77gpqne1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b199e255248d3be0eef707f09b9fbb662bc900",
