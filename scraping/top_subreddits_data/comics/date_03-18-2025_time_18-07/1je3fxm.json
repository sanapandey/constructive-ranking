His feeling might be a reaction to these predictions.\u00a0\n\nOf course if he thinks it will *literally* last forever, that\u2019s obviously wrong.

When organic matter such as algae - oil contains very few dinos, despite the memes - gets subducted or buried in a hypoxic (oxygen-free) environment the pressure above can turn it to oil. We can then dig it up and burn it, releasing the stored solar energy (one of the reasons to love solar panels: Cut out those algae middlemen! Get energy wholesale from the source!). However, we are burning oil several thousand times faster than it's being regenerated naturally. \n\nMagma (which is what I assume your Dad means by lava) is much more common than oil, but it isn't made so much as it is recycled. If you started say, mining all the iron and having said iron slowly turn to rust, we would eventually run out of iron veins. Sometime in the future (but probably not in our lives or even our grandkid's lives) it will become economically worthwhile to turn rust back into iron, a process that requires lots of energy and is not usually done now outside a handful of industrial applications (for example: rust is a key ingredient in Thermite and turns back into iron during the reaction, transfering its oxygen atoms to the aluminum dust)",

We actually do get almost all of our iron from magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3), which are, chemically speaking, rust. Hematite is the exact same rust you get from leaving iron out in the air. Pretty much all the iron on Earth\u2019s surface rusted billions of years ago when cyanobacteria pumped oxygen into our atmosphere. There\u2019s tons of unoxidized iron in the core, but most of what\u2019s on the surface today has been on or near the crust since then.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s part of why making steel emits so much CO2. Partially because it takes lots of energy, but also because you have to remove the oxygen from the iron, which involves giving the oxygen something it can bind more strongly to, usually carbon. There are some new types of furnaces that use hydrogen instead, meaning they only emit water which is pretty cool! This takes even more energy, but green energy is getting exponentially cheaper, so between recycling and these new furnaces we have a good path to decarbonizing steel production in the coming decades.\u00a0",

It gets buried. Referring to oil as \"stored solar energy\" has the same feeling as calling a steak second hand vegetarian.\n\nMost of our oil comes from 400 to 100 million years ago, so the factor of \"several thousands times faster\" is giving the wrong picture. A factor of 1 million would be a more appropriate description.\n\nIt's called magma when it's below the ground, lava after reaching the surface.
