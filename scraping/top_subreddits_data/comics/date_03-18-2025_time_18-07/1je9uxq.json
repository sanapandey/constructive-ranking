Secondly, nobody is in here arguing that. There is no discussion about that. There isn't a single post here with a user arguing that pants have always, and will always be the defacto clothing item for legs.\n\n>It isn\u2019t an issue of only having one example, it has more to do with this being the best example (if a little extra)\n\nWhat exactly are you trying to say?
