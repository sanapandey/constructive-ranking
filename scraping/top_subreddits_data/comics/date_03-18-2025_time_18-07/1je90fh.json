I just happen to love big cats with leopards being my personal favorite\n\nJaguars are typically much more stalky than leopards, being built for running fades with Caimans as an almost consistent food-source. Their tails and fur are also typically shorter\n\nAs for leopards, they\u2019re generally thinner and more built for agility (though they\u2019re still pound-for-pound the strongest big cats on the planet). Their tails are longer and their fur\u2019s a bit fluffier, especially in young leopards and females\n\nThe best way to spot the difference, though, is in their rosettes, which is the splotched, oval-like pattern that covers their bodies. On a jaguar, those rosettes will have small spots on the center. Meanwhile, leopards have completely empty rosettes. Hope that helps!",
