Me and my wife are on different schedules because of her getting a third shift job. \n\nShe'll often get carried away playing FF14 before work these days and realize too late that she doesn't have time to get boned and goes to work super frustrated while I'm going to bed.\n\nMy libido has been tamed over the years and I don't suffer from over expectation often anymore but my wife has no such training and it really gets to her so she'll be like \"you better bone me tonight!\" The next day only for her to get carried away with 14 again XD\n\nBeen telling her she's gotta take a break from that game.",
