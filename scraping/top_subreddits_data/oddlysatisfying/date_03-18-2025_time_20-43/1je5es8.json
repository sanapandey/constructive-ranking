Yes it's much better to clean with water straight down the drain than to push dirt around with a map, see the industrial spray vacuum that are used professionally. But these things can dry out quickly and stink, also a egress for unwanted visitors. Plus given what things cost here in the US putting them in will cost you a lot.\n\nI am a old Kitchen bull, and opened my fair share of new kitchens. Local boards of health are all over the place with these things. From hell no to yes. \nPersonally a fan of you aren't in a cockroach heavy area.",
