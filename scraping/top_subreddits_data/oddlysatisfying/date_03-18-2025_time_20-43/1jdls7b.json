Her house had always been piled with stuff as far back as I can remember, and my mom said it had been like that for long before I was around. Those wonderful people helped her haul away things that needed to be trashed, helped her box up what needed donated, and helped her organize what was left. Seeing the before and after was amazing! And she really stuck with the organization! Barring anything that needed tweaked/fixed for convenience, she left everything where they set it up, and if she needed it, it went back to its designated spot. This is a huge achievement for her, and we're all so proud!\n\nI know what I've described is different from having a robbery take place (my condolences to the victims), but all this is to say, thank you for what you do. Having a clean, tidy space is so impactful in multiple ways. If no one has taken time to appreciate you lately, know that I appreciate you for how you help others.",
