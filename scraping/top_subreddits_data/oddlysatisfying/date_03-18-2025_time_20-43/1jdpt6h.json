Because it is quick enough to actually catch up with exhausted prey.\n\nYou need more calories to propel your whole body weight, but it's still more calorie *effective* at getting close to prey than walking quickly behind it, because we presumably wouldn't have caught anything and spent more calories by having to go longer, and maybe even lost the prey.\n\nSo it's: \nmore calories burned + more effective at gaining ground - passed time - chance for prey to get away/ out of sight = more prey = bigger total net gain in calories by investing calories effective.\n\nI'm sorry for nerding back but I'm weirdly invested in prehistoric humanity and evolutionary biology lol",

It means it's the most effective form of long-distance locomotion.\n\nThat, so far, is correct\n\n> Which means it burns fewer calories than speed-walking. Fewer calories burned = longer distance crossed = more dead bison/deer/prey to eat. Caveman zug.\n\nThat is, sadly, for your bruised ego, incorrect.\nIt burns MORE calories. It's still more Efficient even though it burns more calories, because the fewer calories that would have been burned by walking, wouldn't have been enough of an investment of calories to reap a sufficient reward.\n\nWe default to jogging even though it burns more calories.\n\nAnd that's what you get butthurt and personal over?\nWork on your own fucking reading comprehension, maybe, before calling others retard.",

I know exactly how persistence hunting works though, and speed is still a factor. If we walked to catch up to exhausted prey, that prey would have more time to rest up, and more time to get further away to get out of sight. If we continuously jog, a frightened flight animal like a gazelle or deer, which is in shock and stress from being followed, might have just laid down to recover, or eat some grass, and the humans would already be there again. So it had to run away again. Humans can play this game for longer. But the reason it works is because we use the MORE calorie intense jogging because it is more calorie EFFECTIVE, and therefore reaps higher rewards.",

As compared to muscle mass and upper body strength. That's why all the modern Ninja Warrior courses are almost exclusively upper body strength. A girl won once, and they had to make sure that never happened again, so they redesigned the courses to be heavy on hanging, swinging, and climbing, with biiiiig gaps to cover (so you have to be tall with a long wingspan, too).\n\nThe cartwheel throw uses flexibility and agility to make up for less muscle and mass, and having to stay in the circle while doing it means it rewards shorter competitors. So we can't allow that.",

But sometimes, if it hasn't been inspected properly and and old or faulty pole is used, and it bends but doesn't go back, it can snap, as you mentioned. And if it snaps while you're inverted, you're coming down on your head. People have died in cases like that. It's some crazy shit.",

Athletes would vault too deep into the pits, landing on the last 3-4 feet and rolling backward, striking their heads on the ground. Since then, vaulting pits have been made broader and deeper, and deaths and severe injuries have gone way down. Contrary to popular belief, breaking a pole isn't as dangerous as many think - the energy is immediately released during a breakage, allowing the athlete to penetrate the pits in a safer area.  I've broken over 10 poles in my career (vaulted in the 80s & 90s when poles were more fragile) and never got injured, other than buzzed hands. In the 40+ years I've pole vaulted, I've never seen a serious injury from a broken pole.  Also, the box area (where the pole is planted) is now covered with 10cm of high-impact foam to cover hard edges. Although pole vaulting is not considered a perfectly safe sport, it is considerably safer today than when it got a reputation as dangerous. Still, accidents happen, but they are rare, and other sports (cheerleading, football, etc.) are considered more dangerous.",

I had another one where I went all the way up but got stuck vertically and came crashing back down on my ass and must have fractured my sternum because it hurt for awhile when I would breathe, and for years when I'd do dips.  Worse was one guy on our team who got full bend on the pole but bailed and the pole came back and hit him in the junk and he had to go to the hospital.  We had it on video camera at the time, but it was like 1 frame of full bend and next frame in his crotch.  They were talking about getting rid of it at the time because a kid in Iowa died that year doing it.  \n\nIt's a pretty unique experience.  It's one of those kinds of things where being tentative screws you up so you just have to go balls to the wall.  Most fun I've ever had when it went well though.",

Athletes would vault too deep into the pits, landing on the last 3-4 feet and rolling backward, striking their heads on the ground. Since then, vaulting pits have been made broader and deeper, and deaths and severe injuries have gone way down. Contrary to popular belief, breaking a pole isn't as dangerous as many think - the energy is immediately released during a breakage, allowing the athlete to penetrate the pits in a safer area.  I've broken over 10 poles in my career (vaulted in the 80s & 90s when poles were more fragile) and never got injured, other than buzzed hands. In the 40+ years I've pole vaulted, I've never seen a serious injury from a broken pole.  Also, the box area (where the pole is planted) is now covered with 10cm of high-impact foam to cover hard edges. Although pole vaulting is not considered a perfectly safe sport, it is considerably safer today than when it got a reputation as dangerous. Still, accidents happen, but they are rare, and other sports (cheerleading, football, etc.) are considered more dangerous.",

Before your parents compare the size of the underwear to your hip size and experience heart strain. Having parents without heart issues will save you a fortune in medical costs down the line. That having been said, they'll probably want to see you be good at it, feel free to disappoint their butts, not everyone pole vaults well.\n\nMaybe try pole dancing if that's more your speed when you're older. Also an impressive physical exertion, judging by the pole dancing archers on youtube that I think they might smoke pot and make cash a paid entertainer. Not all adult workers need to toil in unrewarding professions. Honestly you don't need to strip or be miserable to be an entertainer. I just don't shave and tell jokes to drunks, they seems to like it fine.\n\n  \nOr you can join dark enlightenment, and get shot by the mounties when you refuse to surrender. After running a ponzi scam or a bogus medical product launch into the canadian shield, and kidnap your own kids in your Tesla with your AR-15 and your phone and your superior logic and reasoning capacities, to post the siege of your family on Twitler X. The purveyors of the Dark enlightenment aren't in it for you, they are in it because it gives billionaires an excuse to be even less moral. and feel smug about it. \n\nSmart people are not dark, they simply feel beset upon by these the dark-enlightened dumbs every century like a theoretical fascist clock and train schedual that actually seems to run on time, so like a non-facist clock. \n\nThese prophets are the cruel humans that only have pride in the color of their skin and their little hacks, trying to sell a 'new' or 'neo' morality prosperity pyramid scheme of racism and slaves.

If you over or undestep, it tends to end up in overextending the pole and launching you more back than you planned. It can be harder as you move up in poles as you are now jumping from farther away and may not feel right. People look at all the body turning as hard, and it is, but initially, you can easily just kind of kick sideways and make it over (people also train with a Bungie chord in place of the bar, so it's pretty low risk). Getting optimal form is more difficult, and does usually require specific training - but a lot of that can be done in steps not on the pole. For example, you can train on a rope upside down to practice the pulling up and launch motion with some assistance. You can use an angled stationary bar to practice the initial swing up and so forth.",

Unless someone has evidence to the contrary?\n\nAnd while it's far down on a pro athletes priority list. Wearing what you feel you look good in or like is definitely a factor. She probably likes to wear this outfit. Given the fact some female pole vaulters are wearing longer skin tight shorts like bike shorts it seems to be a choice.",

Coach didn't want the star sprinters getting hurt pole vaulting, so it worked out for me.  Also, Pole Vaulting is a very time consuming sport so it's hard to do it with a bunch of other races getting in the way.  You do a lot of conditioning, and technique work on the ground with a short stubby pole first to get the movement right.  Then you start mapping out your steps and doing run throughs without actually vaulting.  Then you start doing mini vaults by not holding as high up on the pole.  Gradually increase until you start getting bend and getting used to it.  Tons of fun.",

As the pole gets longer it gets much further from the athlete and harder to control (and much heavier).  You have to be able to precisely lower it to the box in a very consistent way, so a larger/heavier pole can be a real pain to work with.  You also need to have a significant and predictable amount of bend because the timing has to be right to absorb the forward momentum and translate it to upward momentum.  It also helps to be quite fast since the momentum is what carries you up.  So more mass would hurt that.  You essentially want to be lean, fast, strong, with good technique.  It also helps to be a bit tall as you are essentially creating a triangle with the pole in the box/and the ground and being somewhat tall/long gives you a nice jump and swing through.  You can take a look at someone like Sergey Bubka for probably what an ideal vaulter is like.   Wikipedia says he's about 6ft, 176lbs.  Bubka \"won six consecutive IAAF World Championships, an Olympic gold medal, and broke the world record for men's pole vault 35 times.\" and \"He was the first pole vaulter to clear 6.0 meters and 6.10 meters.\"",
