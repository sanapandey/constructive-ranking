    "selftext": "Basically what the title says. I did the boring thing of actually testing it with a timer. Test was with and without a fully condensed Lullu in the base. Growth time was 80 minutes (on default settings) regardless of whether or not a Lullu was present. Ignore whoever tells you they work for the orchards. After Googling around for a while I could never find anything conclusive, so here you all go \u263a\ufe0f",
