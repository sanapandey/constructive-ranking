Pretty sure 3 is enough to refill the first by the time the last is full.\n\nI also might replace Azurmane with a Generator Pal with Transport. Collecting the ground clutter doesn't give base Pals XP, so with a Transport Pal and a chest you'll get an extra small little stream of random items.  Personally I put my breeding base at a Skill Fruit Tree so I would get Skill Fruit in the trickle of bonus loot.\n\nIt might also be good to add a Statue of Power and the Pal Dressing Facility as well, maybe make some storage at this base be where you store your Training Manuals, Training Crystals, IV fruit, Skill Fruit, Applied Technique manuals and any Pal Extracts you have. Make it so all the resources you need to push a Pal from freshly hatched to \"perfect\" are all at this one base.",

But I've been doing a lot of base building and upgrading so I needed most materials to be available as soon as I put down a pal box and guild chest.   But I did know that food stayed good in the guild chest. Now that I think of it I could put the super meals that boost stats in there to save them.  I've just gotten strong enough to attack the level 55 oil rig but still have some room for growth which is why I'm breeding.  I'll need to look at food and how many food buffs can stack too.",
