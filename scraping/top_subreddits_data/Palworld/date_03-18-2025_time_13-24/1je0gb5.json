This isn't an rpg, and for the background lore the game is following, it seems to give enough freedom to make one's own story, while pretty much resolving the overarching one bit by bit.",

Once the map is finalized, they just need to go back and add more environmental details, like what are these ruins from, why does the game feel like it's both a post apocalyptic world and modern day version of finding Skull Island.\n\nThere's lore out there, and I'm willing to wait until closer to the 1.0 release to see where they go with the lore they've established.",
