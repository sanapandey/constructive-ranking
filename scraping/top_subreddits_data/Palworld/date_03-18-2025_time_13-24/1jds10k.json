They neither look great for displaying pals because they're too big to show off an individual, nor provide enough physical space for stored pals to 'fit' when you've thrown 30 astegons in there. \n\nMake an actual display cage for keeping the godlike pal as a monument - I know we'll end up with a bunch of lovanders and nyafias on pedestals, but that's a price I'm willing to pay. \n\nIn return, give me a storage pen where I can dump 60 pals while I work through who I'm keeping and who's getting butchered or condensed, and don't give it the visual display of the pals so we don't get slammed with a performance hit.",

Official settings are rough though, but unofficials are a good time.\n\nThe one area palworld does better is the boss progression.  Ark puts them all at the end game step, so you play, build, collect, tame repeat, and then have to chill at base breeding tames to do the bosses with breaks to grind out tributes on rare creatures.  It stops momentum.",

I could whine about the Switch P\\*kemon games all day, ha. Just sucks the main game I was waiting for to buy a Switch for ended up being so awful. Having all but two of my favorite Pok\\*mon get snapped by The Cut was the final straw.\n\nTo make it worse, you used to be able to buy the \"third version\" games for $40 and get all the content, now each game is $60 and the DLC is $40, so even if you buy a used copy for $40 you're still paying the extra $40 for the DLC, and you can't even get \"complete\" package on sale because even the physical version of the \"complete\" game has the DLC separate as a digital download, which is one-time use.  \nNo game is worth $100. Heck, no game is worth $70. Very few are worth $60.  \nI think it's why I've pretty much checked out of \"modern\" gaming; I never buy games for more than like $15 unless they're amazing, and I also ended up getting into r/SBCGaming stuff because of it, which I've pretty much fallen in love with.\n\nI mean I was already getting out of \"modern\" gaming thanks to one time when I bought Dragon's Dogma DA full price from a Gamestop, brand new, and Gamestop repackaged the game's case for a 1-disc one so they could reuse the 2-disc DDDA case for something else, which led to the game's discs just rattling around in there scuffing each other up (you can't get refunds on new games).",

Do I think Palworld was too similiar?  No, but I can't blame Nintendo much here.",

Creature collectors are far from rare but they're usually turn-based RPGs (that's not necessarily a bad thing, mind, but it can alienate some), having real time combat and the ability to fight and work and just generally live alongside your creatures presumably scratches an itch that's gone unscratched for ages for a lot of genre fans. Hell, the last time I can think of a game anywhere close to this was Spectrobes Origins. **And that was sixteen years ago.**\n\nWhile, sure, you could probably attribute part of the fame (or infamy, depends on who you ask) to the central joke of \"take pokemon, add guns and copious amounts of animal cruelty the likes of which would have PETA doing corkscrews\", it's undeniable that it found a sorely untapped corner of the market and has filled it well despite still being a work in progress.",

Not only being able to order from an app, but also having access to your driver's location and getting a fee upfront, as opposed to the whims of the meter.\n\nBut those established companies fought against Uber, and the threat they posed to the status quo. IIRC TfL was particularly vehement about this, arguing to the courts that Uber had a technological advantage that they couldn't compete with...\n\nBut my answer has always been; why didn't you beat them to it? You had all the cards, and could have invested in this technology earlier. Why should a new company be cut off at the knees because you couldn't be arsed to innovate yourselves \n\nSo frankly, the Pok\u00e9mon lawsuit is simply that. A company that sat on their laurels and refused to acknowledge their fanbase wants, and when someone makes a game that scratches the itch their immediate defence response is \"smash it's head with a rock\"...\n\nPalworld does a lot differently. It's not just, Pok\u00e9mon with guns. There's a far deeper breeding game for passive traits, which tie into not just battle prowess, but also worker ability; another idea implemented independent of the Pok\u00e9mon framework. Add open world and multiplayer coop; stuff Pok\u00e9mon players have been clamouring for and have been ignored and you have a recipe for fun\n\nIf they are after a new idea for working on, the devs could do worse than look at a new \"totally original space marine game featuring a young lady in a powersuit, who upgrades her weapons throughout the game, and fights aliens that look slightly like dinosaurs\"",

It'd be unfair to discount that part of it. \n\n*However*, the game is phenomenally fun for at *least* the first 20-30 hours; the loop of finding new pals to build up your base, optimizing for maximum work speed, breeding new pals. For me, it scratches an itch for a game like ARK, but with way lower stakes, and more simplified.\n\nEither way, the game at $30 was a steal for the entertainment value and to be a part of the hype at the time. I mean, *everyone* on my friends list was playing it at the time. \n\nI haven't played since the first month of release (but keep up with stuff via the subreddit) and I'm excited to see where the game goes. Hoping PP does good on their promise to keep the game alive.",

Given no one seems to be mentioning anything else the guy said, or even mentioned his name lol.\n\n>\"Not a lot of people know this, but most of our company at that time was a remote company,\" Buckley said. \"We had an office, but very few people went to the office. But everyone went on launch day. It was going to be a little celebration, a little bit of alcohol, a little bit of fun, and then go home. So we launched the game, went over to the vending machine, and started drinking. About 20 minutes later, our network engineer, our one network engineer, said the game has crashed. The Epic servers have crashed. That's when things started to get weird.\"\n\nGotta be a really surreal experience for them to go from thinking it'd be a minor success in Japan to hitting the millions almost immediately. That poor network engineer.\n\n>It really was unbelievable, and just seeing this today still kind of freaks me out. We finished off the month with 25 million players, that was 30 days post-release, and this was kind of the last time we ever publicly spoke about player numbers. There's a few reasons for this, but basically the short version is that there were some bad vibes coming, and these bad vibes convinced us to stop marketing for a while and go a little bit quiet.\"\n\nInteresting bit with the marketing there at the end. I did notice their Twitter account at the time did suddenly stop making posts about the player numbers even though they were still rising a significant amount. I have a few guesses on what the \"bad vibes\" he is referencing might have been. But sucks that something pour a bucket over what should have been a time of celebration for them.",

Not only being able to order from an app, but also having access to your driver's location and getting a fee upfront, as opposed to the whims of the meter.\n\nBut those established companies fought against Uber, and the threat they posed to the status quo. IIRC TfL was particularly vehement about this, arguing to the courts that Uber had a technological advantage that they couldn't compete with...\n\nBut my answer has always been; why didn't you beat them to it? You had all the cards, and could have invested in this technology earlier. Why should a new company be cut off at the knees because you couldn't be arsed to innovate yourselves \n\nSo frankly, the Pok\u00e9mon lawsuit is simply that. A company that sat on their laurels and refused to acknowledge their fanbase wants, and when someone makes a game that scratches the itch their immediate defence response is \"smash it's head with a rock\"...\n\nPalworld does a lot differently. It's not just, Pok\u00e9mon with guns. There's a far deeper breeding game for passive traits, which tie into not just battle prowess, but also worker ability; another idea implemented independent of the Pok\u00e9mon framework. Add open world and multiplayer coop; stuff Pok\u00e9mon players have been clamouring for and have been ignored and you have a recipe for fun\n\nIf they are after a new idea for working on, the devs could do worse than look at a new \"totally original space marine game featuring a young lady in a powersuit, who upgrades her weapons throughout the game, and fights aliens that look slightly like dinosaurs\"",
