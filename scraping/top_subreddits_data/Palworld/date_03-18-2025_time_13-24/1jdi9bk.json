To my knowledge the best weapon is the laser gattling gun but to be honest I'm not entirely sure. I do have one tip though, DON'T BOTHER WITH THE LASER GUN. The pump action shotgun and even the advanced bow do more. I made a legendary and wasted soo much stuff ugh.\n\nYou only have to be insane about items if you wanna 100% the game and even then just watch a tut (or ask me I'll tell you my strat), don't bother overbreeding your pals if you don't care. Putting souls into them is just fine ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)\n\nSorry if this sounds really confusing or you weren't asking for this I'm not very good with people ASFHGSSF",

Frostallion already has legend and ice emperor by default, then I used an anubis I had bred earlier that had demon god and muscle head. They both already had high hp and atk ivs, which didn't passover in this case. The next egg tho had ivs in the 90 with these perks, with serenity instead of ice emperor.\n\n\nI basically had to keep hatching eggs tho until the passive I wanted finally appeared so it takes awhile. I had enough rejects to condense Bastigor to 2 star",
