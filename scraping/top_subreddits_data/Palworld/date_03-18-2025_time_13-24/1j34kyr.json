I moved over to crossover and that's been significantly better especially performance wise however I'm still experiencing some minor bugs that I was hoping the native port would solve.  \n\nI have to play in windowed mode or else the mouse will escape and cause issues.  I had to disable a lot of macos's multi tasking features because they'd trigger while playing and if I look down for too long the task bar pops up which lets the mouse escape.  But not being able to play on my dedicated server on the macos port means I won't be switching off of crossover anytime soon",

Reasons for people preferring macOS over Windows include being more stable and efficient. Being Unix-based is also a big reason why certain crowds prefer it over Windows. Hardware was good from the outside (great trackpads, screens, thin and light, etc.), but the cooling was not adequate for the Intel CPUs and AMD GPUs that they housed.\n\nThe switch to M-series chips was significant, as now the hardware itself is enough of a reason to get one over a Windows machine. The M-series chips, especially on the CPU side, are much more capable than the Intel and AMD offerings, to be enough of a reason to get one over a Windows machine. On the desktop side, it doesn't matter as much, as one can feed the AMD/Intel chips enough power to mostly match the performance of the M-series chips, but with laptops, it makes a huge difference.\n\nThe pricing of Macs compared to Windows machines is also not as crazy as it used to be (back in 2018, Apple sold $2000 MacBook Pros with Intel integrated graphics...). This is partly due to it being cheaper for Apple to use their own chips instead of buying them from other vendors. For example, the $500 M4 Mac mini is quite a good deal.\n\nHowever, there are also some artificial limits imposed by Apple that pretty much \"force\" people to buy a Mac, like requiring a Mac to deploy apps for iOS. I strongly dislike such practices, and don't think they are necessary; the Mac platform can stand on its own.",

Windows does nothing better except gaming which is logical because small portion of players are on mac only, games don't get ported that often because of the \"small\" market. \n\nI suggest you check some of the latest macs benchmarks and see the comparaison with windows hardware performance. Macs post 2020 are wild performance wise. Look, you can comfortably play Palworld, Death Stranding with ease on a base model mac from 2020. \n\nHungry games like the Hoyoverse games works like a charm on Macs, actually better than windows in my own experience while bing very gentle on the battery. \n\nPalworld is a new release, it will get updates and get better at some point.",

So there's no point spending to play the game on my Macbook, and then ALSO spending the same amount of money to buy it on Steam later to play with friends.\n\nWould have been smarter to just put it on Steam and allow crossplay like so so many other games that support both platforms.",
