    "selftext": "Random thought of the day, was wondering what the chances are to get alphas through breeding for those who like the larger ones or just like the increased HP pools, maybe there can be some sort of device or resource to turn them into alphas or would it just be rng like usual? \n\nOr does your chance of breeding alphas increase if both parents happen to be alphas or such? I managed to get a perfect anubis with all the good working traits and it happened to be an alpha female so now its like: ok what about use who might want bases full of giant pals, wonder if that could be made easier?\n\nJust a thought...or perhaps something to bring up with pocket pair just cover as many things asked as possible before 'the end.'",
