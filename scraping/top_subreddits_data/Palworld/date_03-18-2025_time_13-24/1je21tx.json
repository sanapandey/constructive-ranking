One of my favorite builds I've seen in the game\n\nIt's pretty hard to build beautiful builds on the medium scale like this right now, especially since all of the best building materials push you toward a Japanese style. \n\nBuilding something beautiful and balanced at this scale of very impressive and you should be proud of it.  You have a great eye for design.",
