Depending on how the process will go, you will either load the Main\u2019s world, then join with the Alt and transfer the Pal back, or load the Alt\u2019s world, and send them to your Main\u2019s world\u2026 not exactly sure how that part will go until it\u2019s here I guess. \n\nYou could even go overboard and make a separate world for each Pal, or each trait, maybe even one where you only store 2 perfect copies of each gender per breed (at level 1; ideal Master Originals) \n\nThe point is you\u2019d create an Alt and they would just be a pack mule for your Main\u2019s extra overflow, that way the main has breathing room in the Palbox for more breeding projects!",
