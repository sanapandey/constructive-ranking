The launch range is very short and the ammo count is extremely limited, and those two pieces of gear solve both problems quite neatly. Enough speed to get in range, enough toughness to survive the blast radius, and enough extra rounds that you can be liberal with target selection. \n\nAlso, I believe that if you dive while firing, the rounds fly significantly further. \n\nIt's an absolute MONSTER against the automations, and very solid against the squids. Stationary fortifications, big dumb hit boxes, and slow moving crowds are it's ideal prey.\n\nAgainst bugs, though, it's merely okay, and the grenade pistol or crisper will serve most people far better. Bile titans are too tall and spindly to easily hit, scavenger and hunter swarms move a bit too fast to avoid friendly fire, bug holes are too numerous and widely spaced for nest clearing, bug breaches spread their reinforcements over too long of a time period, and it's just wildly inefficient overkill against standard chargers. If you hate impalers, behemoths, and shrieker nests, though, it's a comfortable way to instantly annihilate all three threats at close ranges.",
