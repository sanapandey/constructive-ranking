They are now less distracted by each other, increasing their reaction speed in large groups. We\u2019ve increased the number of AI calculations the game can perform. This primarily impacts scenarios with a high number of spawned enemies, improving their response times in those situations. However, this comes with a slight trade-off in game performance.\n\nAccording to recent intel, the enemies of Freedom are attempting to counter the Helldivers' anti-air capabilities. Newly-produced **Automaton dropships** show clear signs of hull reinforcement, allowing the main body to absorb significantly more damage.\n\n* Automaton Dropships: Main body health increased from 2500 to 3500\n\n**Illuminate Warp Ships** have been observed deploying their shields mid-flight.\n\n* Illuminate Dropships: Utilizes the same shield as the ones that have landed\n\n**Barrager Tank Turret**\n\n* Resolved an issue introduced recently where the armor value was incorrectly set to 0. Now has the correct armor value of 5\n* Additionally, the turret now features weak spots at the front and back, each with 750 HP and an armor value of 3\n\n# \ud83c\udfaeGameplay\n\n**Settings:**\n\n* Added new separate settings for inverting the gyro input instead of using the Invert Look settings\n* The Stratagem loadout menu has undergone an updated categorization of the different stratagem groupings\n\n# \ud83d\udd27Fixes\n\n**Resolved Top Priority issues:**\n\n* Fixed an issue with the extraction beacon sometimes being unreachable when landing on top of enemies\n* General optimization improvements in the colonies environments\n\n**Crash Fixes, Hangs and Soft-locks:**\n\n* Fixed a crash when playing against Terminids in poor network scenarios\n* Fixed a rare crash that happened during game shut down on PC\n* Fixed a crash that could occur when there was a high amount of particles on the screen at once\n* Fixed an issue where players could be blocked from completing objectives requiring called-down equipment due to the required stratagem being unavailable\n\n**Weapons and Stratagems**\n\n* Fixed the G-123 Thermite Grenade sometimes not arming\n* Fixed a rare crash when using the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle\n* Fixed a bug where switching weapons while reloading the CB-9 Exploding Crossbow would sometimes discard an entire magazine without actually reloading\n\n**Social & Multiplayer Fixes**\n\n* Fixed an issue causing players in low-activity regions to see fewer lobbies on the planet hologram than expected\n* Fixed an issue in low-activity regions where lobbies were not seeing players join as frequently or quickly as before\n* Fixed an issue on low-activity planets where Quickplay would always join your friends game, even if they were not playing on the same difficulty\n* Fixed a disconnection issue that could happen when playing Gloom missions with poor connection to the host\n* Fixed some interactions not working properly after canceling the Raise Weapon emote\n* Fixed an issue where adding, removing, blocking, or unblocking friends caused player cards in the friend list to display with white text and missing information until you close and open the panel again\n* Fixed an issue that made it impossible to mute or kick players who were in the loadout when joining a squad\n* Fixed an issue that caused some new Steam players' latest profile names to not display correctly in-game\n\n**Miscellaneous Fixes**\n\n* Fixed some memory leaks to improve performance\n* Fixed old text chat messages from re-appearing\n* Fixed an issue with the Democracy Space Station progress bars being unintentionally curved in appearance\n* Fixed a bug that prevented progression through the menus when the initial language selection was set to English (US)\n* Fixed the raise weapon emote to properly fire projectiles in the direction of the weapon\n* Fixed Helldivers sliding around on the ground after exiting the ragdoll state (despite it being the year of the snake and despite us trying to fix this previously)\n\n\\--------\n\n[Helldivers 2 Patch Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1bd6hse/helldivers_2_patch_notes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Known Issues List](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1fjoxi9/)",

They were *pathetically* easy before due to how easy it was to completely shut off their reinforcements because there were like 5 different ways to shut off their reinforcements. Now some of them are harder/impossible without multiple people doing them instead of just one.\n\nA team with ~2-3 AT emplacement stratagems and/or 4 rocket sentry stratagems could clear an Illuminate evacuate assets without actually fighting any Illuminate. You'd just spend 10 minutes shooting down their dropships and then leave.\n\nWas it effective? Yes. Was it kinda funny the first time I saw a team do it? Yes. *Was it*  **extremely boring** *every other time after that?* Definitely. Players will optimize the fun out of the game if you let them.\n\nIf there's any one thing I'd cut down on Illuminate, it's their proclivity for (on evacuate assets) dropping their very first set of guys directly on top of the outer gates and disintegrating the gates instantly, and possibly the flying overseer's tendency to (on certain map layouts) fly right over the players and just zerg the generators once they get within a certain distance (>!because on the map layout I'm thinking of, you can get within that distance after they break through the second gate and have to constantly babysit the generators for like 5+ minutes to stop them cheesing you!<). \n\nBut as long as their very scary reinforcements are tied up in a single easy-to-predict, easy-to-avoid, easy-to-kill unit that makes loud honking noises constantly to announce its presence, their reinforcements need to *actually* be scary and not \"trivialized by one idiot with a rocket launcher and a rocket sentry\". Because if you *don't* have someone dealing with Watchers then you get to just deal with most reinforcement waves for free anyway and get to ignore that entire mechanic, and if you *do* then you're almost certainly never going to see any reinforcements *at all*.",

And I have seen people destroy buildings with the railcannon, it's obviously not the best, but with a 60 sec cooldown, you now have a guaranteed dead titan every minute with the ability to destroy structures in a pinch. If that isn't overpowered, I don't know what is. Not even precision has a cooldown that low and back in its heyday you still had to use skill to land a direct shot on a titan, justifying its 1 hit kill.\n\n\"Railcannon can't take out buildings while OPS can, and has an AoE effect for chaff too.\"\n\nAnd you're mostly right, except your next line renders this point moot. Like you said, precision's chaff clearing and building destruction is laughable compared to the 500kg, which *also* kills heavies more effectively. The reason precision was once the meta was because the explosion damage alone was enough to kill multiple chargers and a direct hit would always kill a titan, similar to the 500kg. If they simply buff its explosion damage so that it performs exactly as it did during EoF, it would be able to compete with 500kg again.",

And it's only going to help you so much when you're being chased by two others *and* several Chargers, and maybe a few Impalers too at the same time. \n\nThis point is even more moot on the bot front where Hulks are almost as common as other chaff units. \n\nAnd since it can't even guarantee an Impaler or Factory Strider OHKO, then it's even more arguable that it needs a massive cooldown reduction. \n\n>Destroy structures in a pinch \n\nI'll admit that I haven't seen or tried this myself so I can't comment on how valid this point is. \n\nI'm also not going to go into OPS validity Vs other statagems since that's another argument entirely. I'll just reiterate my point in saying OPS and Railcannon serve different niches and buffing Railcannon via massive cooldown reduction isn't going to impact OPS usage much (if at all).",

OPS used to be the \"dead titan every minute\" stratagem, but it required skill to get the timing right. With railcannon, you just throw it and forget it. I think you're underestimating the advantage of not having to aim in the middle of a firefight.\n\nBetween our massively buffed AT weapons, thermite grenades, and ultimatum, bile titans wouldn't even get the chance to stand if there was a titan deleter going off every minute. Keep in mind, railcannon automatically targets the biggest enemy which is a huge advantage when things are too hectic to properly aim a precision. The only way to really balance a \"set and forget\" kind of weapon like that is to limit how much you can use it, which is why I'm fine with the cooldown.",

AP4 on Eruptor's projectile component *does* bump the damage up higher when hitting AV3, but not quite that much.\n\nFrankly, I really *dislike* the Crossbow. It does far too many things far too effectively. Even at a lower single-hit damage compared to Eruptor, it still wins out in DPS on account of firerate. Their tradeoffs and respective niches would be more stark if they just nerfed the thing, but it seems they don't want to.",

It's range is not so much a weakness as it is a tradeoff for having more DPS than any Medium Pen AR/SMG and more Pen than any Light Pen AR/SMG with equal DPS.\n\nReducing its spread is fine so long as it isn't a spread of, say, 20 like the Sickle. At 40 spread it is reasonably tighter but still not a Bot sniping machine, which is perfect. Reprimand naysayers have said a lot about \"guns should always shoot straight\" but if first shot accuracy on the Reprimand was so good it would outcompete the Abjudicator and it wouldn't even be close, even with the Abjudicator's upcoming buff.",

By the time it comes to a stop so you can hit it, it's usually in the process of dropping troops so then it doesn't matter if you shoot it down, they drop anyway.  I always enjoyed supporting other divers by hitting the ships that were coming in to drop troops on them from a ways off if it wasn't someone I was paired p with while also having the flexibility to hit things close up.  Since the RR is losing that long distance ability it loses half of it's appeal and I'd rather just carry the AC.",

            "body": "- Liberator and Stalwart have the 5.5x50mm FMJ round buffed to 80 damage, still odd the Liberator Carbine didn\u2019t get the buff as well.\n- Automaton Dropships can no longer be destroyed with one Recoilless Rifle to the Hull\n- increasing the uses of the 110mm Rocket Pods is nice, but its massive parallax still causes it to miss half of the rockets, thus failing to oneshot things it should oneshot. Still a great tool to weaken stuff.\n- Sterilizer ergonomics buff is absolutely huge. You can see in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/s/T3jGA24Mng) clip that being able to aim from left to right quickly is paramount for the weapon.\n- Illuminate Warp Ships now also need an additional shot to take out with a recoilless, or the assistance of a teammate to strip the shield off.\n\nThat said, there are still a couple things I feel need some work.\n\n- the Spear is really lackluster as a supposed hard hitting anti-tank weapon. I only have 3 spare shots, and nearly no control over where they are going to hit my target. It should get a serious damage buff to ensure a oneshot on heavies, regardless of where they are hit.\n- The Orbital Precision Strike was buffed in the wrong place when they increased the health of all heavies to offset their loss of armor in the buff patch. The OPS used to be able to kill heavies with its AoE, but after they buffed the heavies\u2019 HP values, Arrowhead **only buffed its direct impact damage, not its AoE damage**. This means that the only way to kill a heavy with the OPS is to get a direct hit. They should scale the AoE damage according to the same upscaling the direct damage received, and it will then once again behave like it did before the buff patch.\n- The STA WASP launcher\u2019s reload is almost as long as its teamreload. Where other support weapons with a backpack get a massive reduction in reload time when teamreloaded, the STA only receives a minor (less than 50%) boost, meaning that two individuals firing a wasp can put out more rockets than one duo teamreloading. This is contrary to all other backpack fed support weapons, where being teamreloaded is the most effective option.\n- The Peacemaker really needs some love as well.",

Too many units, explosions, physics etc. and yeah, my guess is the game engine starts to struggle. \n\nSo there is something to say about that. The devs have to tinker until they find a perfect balance between spawn rates, quality of physics simulation and performance optimization.\n\nThis is probably very hard to do, and for now I'm happy that they prioritize new content. I'm sure they have budget for it now, but throwing money at something doesn't mean it'll be faster or easier to solve.

Do we even need 10 settings?

Last year, there were months where the game was challenging enough, but the weapons felt poor to shoot. The result is that you use the weapon that sucks the least and don't look forward to new Warbond weapons.  \n  \nThe new side mission looks fun, I'll give it a go and see how the other changes feel.

Along with a fix to the barrage tank's armour, buffs to the bot dropship (hopefully be less easy to shoot them down), and the illuminate dropship will use it's shields in flight (also, hopefully, making it less easy to shoot down).",

Slugger is more interesting with high spread; if any of the primary guns were to be given heavy pen, I'd have chosen *that one,* because it reinforces the \"you just shoot the enemy anywhere\" idea rather than just being a DMR pretending to be a shotgun. Now it's just in a race with DCS (and the new lever-action) again.\n\nSame thing goes for Eruptor; the idea that it was the \"strong AoE, less direct dmg\" tradeoff to the Crossbow is out the window. Now they're just *both* doing straightforward high-damage stuff. Yes, I'm aware Crossbow *also* has very strong AoE, but the idealized version of it was geared more toward single-target and they simply overtuned the thing while overcompensating their buffs.\n\nOn the whole, they're just tripling down on power creep as a direction for their game overall. If they forget a gun, that gun gets left behind. If they don't constantly adjust enemy strength proportionally, the game gets too easy over time. It's more work for them that risks more and more oversights as opposed to just establishing a baseline of balance and working around it.\n\nedit:typo",
