It's like they've internalized the galactic war propaganda so much that they treat it like a responsibility. Between bitching about time between updates and bitching about players not diving on the optimal planet 100% of the time, it genuinely amazes me how many people seem to have forgotten that Helldivers 2 is a **silly computer game we play for fun.**",
