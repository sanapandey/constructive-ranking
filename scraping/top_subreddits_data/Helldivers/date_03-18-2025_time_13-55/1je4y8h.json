Before the patch, the Stalwart seemed like a fun option against the squids to me, especially on max RPM to really cleave through chaff and even the overseers, but the issue was that using primaries to kill Harvesters wasn't exactly the most ideal option. The new Eruptor really changes up the playing field, not to mention that even if it doesn't 1-shot, it can still stagger them like the autocannon.",

Eruptor change only effects the projectile itself, which only deals 230/115 damage.  \nWhat's happening here is that you're hitting it in just the right place that all of (or a lot of) the shrapnel is hitting the hip, which is AP3.  \nEach shrapnel piece does 110/35 damage, and there is 30 of them per shot. The hip has 50% durable modifier and 1000hp.\nThe projectile of the eruptor does 173 damage, so that's 827 hp left. Dividing that by the shrapnels damage, you'd need 18 to hit the hip to kill it.  \nExplosion damage doesn't matter as the hip is immune to explosives.\n\nThere is a reason the best way to use the eruptor is to shoot *under* your target.\n\nEDIT: [Video proof it doesn't change anything.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jeamya/new_eruptor_can_not_oneshot_harvesters/)",
