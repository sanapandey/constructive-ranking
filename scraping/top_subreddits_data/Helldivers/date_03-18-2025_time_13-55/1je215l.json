Like make meganests and fortresses spawn on 6 and above, and increase the number of them by difficulty.

Battle items, all of which are aquired through battles that are harder than regular ones, but can be even harder for greater rewards. Before that point, you have access to literally everything in the game. \n\nYou all can think that im wrong, but putting meganests/fortresses on diff 6 as a chance to appear or as a mission type, while spawning them at an additive rate(1 on D7, 2 on D8, all the way up to D10 having 4, replacing light nests/outposts)  would make everyone stop complaining about how hard diff 10 is while simultaneously making D10 harder for the people that want a challenge",
