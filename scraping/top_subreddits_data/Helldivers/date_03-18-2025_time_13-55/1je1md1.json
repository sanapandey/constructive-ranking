I'm imagining it would essentially serve as a middle-ground between impacts and normal grenades. If you need a delayed detonation like a standard grenade you crank the timer up. If you need something quicker, more like an impact, and don't want to cook you crank the timer down. So like a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" scenario.\n\nAlso if they let us set much longer timers I could imagine some very unique plays happening with these.\n\nI don't know if any of that is enough to make them meta, but hopefully they should be fun. We'll just have to wait and see.",

Siege Ready gives us faster reload for all weapons and better ammo reserves.\n\nMy personal suggestion for the cowboy armor is to give it faster fire rate for single action weapons as well. That can give it a \"cowboy action shooting\" angle, and usage that applies to primaries too. Pump shotguns and bolt actions, and the new lever action would all shoot faster. That, in addition to the existing benefits for pistols, would make the armor quite good I think.",
