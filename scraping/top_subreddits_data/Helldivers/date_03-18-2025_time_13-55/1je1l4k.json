You're opinion/statement can be valid and you can say what you want. But saying that people can't handle your opinion/statements is such a self centered take.  They did handle it. They downvoted your comment and probably went about their day. Why would it be any more complicated than that?",

Granted this one did come out in roughly one month compared to SoF which took two. I do like that this one comes with a booster that'll be especially useful for newer players!\n\nThat said though, I really do not like this trend of warbonds having less and less and less in them despite being the full price of 1000sc (which I'm sure this one will be too.)\n\nAlso, does that new jetpack let you drift around in the air as well? Like can you control your movements while you're up there? Or are you just fixed in place in the air for a bit? They just show him remaining static in the trailer so I'm curious!",

Two hours of time every two months (or realistically much less if one actually plays the game and earns SC in missions rather than only hopping on when a new warbond drops) is so undermonetized as to be essentially free.\n\nWarbonds don't expire, there's a path to getting them through playtime, and even superstore items rotate through regularly (there are three times as many pages now, too!). If one would rather not play the game frequently then they have the option to pay for the privilege of unlocking everything with money instead of time\u2014 but expecting everything in a live-service game to be given out for free is just entitlement. We received the game we paid for, and we continue to receive free updates in terms of new enemies and stratagems (we just got gas mines, and FRVs before that!)\u2014 there's no reason we should also get premium content on top of that without either investing the time to play and enjoy the game or dropping $10 every once in a while.

The Talon is also welcome, though I'm not sure if I'd prefer it over the Senator.\n\n\nThat being said, this warbond is a bit disappointing. The hover pack seems to be mostly useful on bugs, and otherwise serves to make you a nice big target elsewhere. I'm also not sure what the use case for the dynamite is? Maybe it's stronger than a grenade, but even then I'd question what the point is in using it versus something like the thermite or HE grenade. Maybe it has some other uses that the video didnt show case. Regardless, I think this was a missed opportunity to introduce a remote detonated explosive of some kind.\n\n\nThe booster seems neat, but I don't think I'm likely to use it if I'm only getting a couple extra samples per match. The opportunity cost is too high to justify it.\u00a0\n\n\nThe cosmetics are pretty cool. I wish the armor set they showed at the end of the trailer was in the pack, but I always expect them to put the best looking armor in the Super Store.",
