                            "body": "The effect of ap3 vs ap4 against an ap3 target will be equivalent to like a 40% impact damage buff.  This will affect certain breakpoints that the gun previously struggled against for consistent 1 shots and add some new utility.  Examples off the top of my head would probably include hiveguard direct face hits, overseer heads, devastator chests (when not quite making your headshot), bile spewer heads, rocket strider leg/pelvis.  This will also allow the weapon to take out hulks with relative ease which is big if you want to run stalwart on bots and want something besides a senator (ultimatum) for structures and striders.  I suspect it will improve 1 shot tendency on gunship engines and maybe make turret vents a 2-3 shot now as well. You can also kill bunker turrets with it now\u2026.but that will be very slow. It should also greatly ease the rate at which a harvester leg goes down as the impact was doing most of that already. Titans and chargers it shouldn\u2019t change much other than being able to add chip damage to other weapons, like the senator.  \n\nEdit:  I should add that you can drop a charger with the senator in 1 mag if you let them charge past you and manage to unload all 6 shots directly into the booty.  This happens due to overpenetration into a 300% to main 30% durable internal hitbox, a mechanic I don\u2019t fully understand but it allows railgun to 1 shot them and AMR to 3 shot them.  Senator rounds are about half an AMR so that explains that.  I don\u2019t think AP4 is going to change its overpenetration ability and even if it does it would be 4-5 via that method alone unless the shrapnel is also able to overpenetrate.  It would be crazy if it could now be 2.  Seriously doubt it.",

Notice how similar they are in use, damage and accuracy, with diferences around rate, mag type, ergonomics and ammo type. IMHO they'll balance both around each other, so while 20 rounds ain't much compared to other weapons, it's quite a lot compared to the slugger's 16. And do note, that in a triad, the CS has around a third less damage per shot than the JAR and the Slugger, but higher DPS and accuracy, on a 15 mag. \n\nThe JAR has the potential to take weakspots in LESS shots than the CS and the same as the slugger. It has more raw AND durable damage PER SHOT than the CS. It's only reason to take more shots is accuracy alone. IT's stronger overall than both.\n\nBy making the JAR 20 mags, you are making it completely outclass both the Slugger and the CS tbh. And while you may take more shots due to accuracy, that's the drawback of the gun itself. With good timed shots it's already strong enough, it's just different.",

The Dominator projectile has higher damage against all targets it can hurt. The range is an advantage, but that is also the niche of the DCS.\n\n>Slugger has better handling and absolutely rips enemies in close to mid ranged and yet again does more weakpint and limb damage.\n\nI can find no reference to weapons doing different damage to limbs in comparison to each other, unless we are talking explosive damage (which the Dominator DOES NOT have, btw). Since very early in the game's lifecycle up until todays patch, the Dominator dealt more damage than the Slugger against both durable and non-durable targets, while simultaneously having considerably more ammunition at hand.\n\n>requires more shots to kill 80% of the time due to lower weakpoint damage.\n\nCitation fucking needed.\n\n>You can also argue that the Slugger is the better choice due to the handling and that allows you to take armor for reload and ammo reserves.\n\nEven with Siege-Ready, the Slugger has less total ammo than the Dominator in its current state. I also find people exaggerate the poor handling of the Dominator as someone who frequently uses and enjoys it, it's totally usable without ergo increases even against Hunters (though not optimal in this situation). I will concede that the handling does make the Slugger easier to use at extreme close range.\n\n>The explosive ammo is a blessing and a curse, while it's good for groups, or striders it makes it's usage feel bad because instead of damage being focused all on one hit for weakpoints or limbs it's spead out meaning it staggers some but makes it frustrating for weakpoints resulting in more ammo usage.\n\nAre we even talking about the same weapon here? The Dominator does not, I repeat, DOES NOT, have any explosive properties to its projectiles. It has always been a single-target weapon. Any perceived increased ammo consumption is due to misses caused in large part  by the slow projectile velocity.",

With projectile lifespan going from 0.7 to 1.0 seconds, the projectile thould go to what, like 200m-ish up from 120m? That means pot shotting gunships and and harassing heavies far away and on a fellow diver is now much more effective",
