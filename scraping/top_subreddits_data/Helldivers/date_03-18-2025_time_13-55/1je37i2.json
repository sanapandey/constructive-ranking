The bots building modular units makes sense. Swap out a gun for a jammer on FS, change up the weapons on hulks and tanks, etc. This works for robots IMO. But each bug type should be their own unique evolution or caste. They could make this mushroom titan reminiscent of a BT but without just reusing the asset. Like how impaler bodies are reminiscent of charger bodies, they didn't just put a tentacle face onto a charger behemoth.",
