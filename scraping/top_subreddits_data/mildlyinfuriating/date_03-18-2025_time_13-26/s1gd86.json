A crack in a phone screen. Duckling shit on your new car. Incomprehensible software. Mismatched buttons. You know, the little things. \n\nThis subreddit isn't meant to incite rage mobs that go after people. For that reason we say:\n\n#No reddit meta posts\n\nNo posts about being banned from subreddit. No posts about up- or down-votes. No posts about shitty moderators or users or subreddits. No posts about reddit. \n\nAll jokes and tomfoolery aside, that sort of thing gets us in trouble with site admins. If we allow one type of post about reddit it then very easily moprhs into allowing posts that directly call out other subreddits or users, we just can't allow any of it. \n\nThat rule already existed for years and we have just made it more clearly visible in the sidebar on old and new reddit. We're gonna be a little strict on it for a bit I'm afraid. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThank you all for being awesome and have a very Merry Christmas! Celebrate Christmas in the traditional European way, with a suasage roll! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/K42ajAZ",
