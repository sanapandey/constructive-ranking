However, from my perspective as someone who's done a variety of jobs that include retail, hospitality, scientific research, manual labor, teaching and more, I can say without a doubt that it's a difficult time these days. There's a lot of insecurity in the job market because of the economic/political landscape worldwide, and it's an employers market too (i.e. They have a lot of applications for individual roles) so they can pick and choose freely. \n\nFor you, as a student, I would highly suggest networking with your lecturers (if possible) and attending career fairs and talking to recruiters there. Very good place to put a face to a name. Ask where previous students in your field have gone to work, and if possible try to get in touch with them and ask for advice.\n\nA part of what makes the process difficult is the constant CV and cover letter tweaking for every single job application. It is exhausting, and demoralising, but if you want to get where you want to go then you need to persevere. As previously mentioned, networking is highly important too. I'm from a pretty small country, and a lot of the time it's about who you know rather than what you know. My Dad used to tell me that all the time, and I didn't listen because I was \"a scientist\" and \"it didn't work that way\" in my area, but he was very right. \n\nFeel free to ask more questions if you want to, will reply when I have a chance to.",

Personally if I were interviewing I'd prefer a candidate that is honest, but it's all a performance at the end of the day.\n\nWish I could help you more bud, but keep the chin up and keep trying. Don't be afraid to reach out to someone, a friend or a loved one, and vent your frustrations because you can be your own worst enemy and make yourself feel worthless.

I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a university student? Finding an entry level position can be hard depending on your field/ industry because of competition. On top of that, if you\u2019re an entry level worker, it\u2019s even harder. I work in cybersecurity now after getting my AS in IT. I didn\u2019t get the cybersecurity position at first though so I took an entry level help desk job. After about 2 years of experience, I landed a vulnerability management position. This is sort of rare but this is where connections and networking matter. While working help desk, I started to go to school for my Bach in computer engineering. While attending classes, I met the CISO and he got me a job at a data center. From there I moved to the security team. Don\u2019t be scared and it\u2019s okay to be nervous. Each interview you go in, you\u2019ll also be a little more confident going in. :) good luck and congrats on graduating soon! I\u2019d say if you wanted to be something higher level then you need to settle for the entry level starting point like I did too but don\u2019t settle on a job you don\u2019t want just because it\u2019s there.\n\nAlso, I have been in the workforce since 2012 with active duty military experience in case anyone wants to take away from my points with the argument of not having work experience:P",
