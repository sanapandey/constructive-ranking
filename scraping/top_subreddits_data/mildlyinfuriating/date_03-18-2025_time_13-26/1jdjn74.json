They have an AI bot that will compare pictures on their site with pictures on places like temu and then deactivate the listings on their end! The deactivations are permanent and the seller can't relist the item without risking their entire shop and there is no way to argue through Etsy support to get the listing reinstated. \nWhat's really great is when you're a seller like me with a popular and original product, and bots on Temu steal your photos to sell knock offs on their site. Then Etsy treats you like you did something wrong and kills half your sales with their automatic listing deletion and there is no one who can help you on their side even if you submit proof that your listing is your own original product and not a drop shipped item. \nIt's super awesome that Etsys listings have seniority so if you had front page results before and years of positive reviews, you get to start from zero with a fresh listing with no reviews and end up on page 15. So great!",

Unfortunately it\u2019s still the best place I know of to find hand made items and certain craft items, but most of the stuff being sold in the jewelry/hobby type sections is absolute garbage. \n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re willing to sift through the trash and do you due diligence, you can still find some really really cool stuff. The get rich quick mentality has ruined almost everything tbh, so idk why we think most of the internet would be different. These people don\u2019t care how much everyone hates them because they\u2019re making money, it\u2019s just how selfish our society is now.",

I\u2019ve bought from \u201cstores\u201d on their site twice, one was a credit card fraud, the other was a person who sold me items that were moldy. \n\nLuckily I got reimbursed for the moldy stuff from the seller, and the money from the other slug, I was able to get reimbursed by my credit card company and I canceled the card, and got a new one issued with different numbers, and I changed my username/ password just in case. \n\nAs for Aliexpress, and the other China-direct companies, I personally don\u2019t trust. I\u2019ve read many times that they are all a den of thieves, so I don\u2019t want to tempt fate. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
