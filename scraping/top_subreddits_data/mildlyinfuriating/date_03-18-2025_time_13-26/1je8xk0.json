Not that big of a deal.\n\nAnd maybe next year for her birthday have \"Happy Birthday Ana\" with a heart next to it instead of an **!**  .\n\nEDIT: for those saying to remove the whole !   that might not work because its red piped on white buttercream, there will be a stain left behind if not enough is scraped off, and then you'd have to level out the white buttercream, which as OP didnt decorate the cake she wont have any of to do so.",
