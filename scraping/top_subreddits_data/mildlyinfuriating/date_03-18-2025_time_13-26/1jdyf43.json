In my case the snooze is for 5 minutes. So I get 3, 5 minute snoozes. After that the alarm either will not stop until I complete the task (getting up and scanning a barcode in the bathroom) or I can watch a 30 second ad and get one more 5 minute snooze. But after that there are no more snoozes and the only way to stop it is to get up.       \n        \nI\u2019m a really heavy sleeper and also deaf in one ear. The alarm is much louder and more annoying the stock alarm app. Having to complete a task to stop it has made getting up much easier for me. I used to just snooze or turn off my alarm in my sleep without even realizing it. I had alarms set every 5 minutes for like an hour just to hope one of them woke me up.       \nI also like that I can change the duration of the snoozes. I wish the stock alarm could do that instead of always being 9 minutes.",

I was riding my motorcycle to work going 55 mph into the wind and STILL heard the alarm blaring at me over my motorcycle and the wind noise with a full face helmet on. You can set it up so the alarm won't even allow you to just turn off your phone. The \"emergency shutoff\" requires you to tap 1 of 4 random boxes 500 FUCKING TIMES. It took me 5 minutes after I got to work to turn the bastard off. \n\nI haven't been inconvenienced by the ads at this point because I don't use the snooze feature, so this app is a godsend",

My old android never had a problem with wakeup alarms which is probably why most people wonder why you would download alarmy (an inferior version of standard android (or huawei?) alarm clock that forcibly maxes the volume and you cant turn it down).",

By the fact that every aspect of your life has been commodified and turned into a subscription/gig/hustle/disruption? That your life has no value beyond some imaginary currency? That you're expected to satisfy the demands of a society that hates you?\n\nIt IS an alarm app, so why on earth does it have an advert for a bankruptcy attorney at the bottom of it? Please stop for a second, I know how an alarm works - can you realise how insane it is, that you have to pay to be left in peace by giant corporations? That you're laying in bed half asleep and all you want is a couple of minutes of being unconscious and instead you're offered some obnoxious coca-cola ad with happy people with perfect lives and all you want is for it to stop existing - you live in the richest, most advanced society to date and all people want to do is stop thinking. They want to plug into podcasts, to listen to music, to watch other people living on TV while they spend 50% of their waking life working to make someone else rich - and when they have the gall to say \"Wow, my alarm app is giving me adverts\" they get barraged by a load of obnoxious \"consumers\" who say \"well if you didn't want ads you should just wake up\" - the irony, the sheer irony of you telling anyone to wake up. Maybe being \"anti-capitalist\" is more than a fashion statement that you say like an edgy teen that's vaguely aware of a bearded guy called Marx? You're confused? I'm not surprised!\n\nMaybe you **should** find something to preach about, cause I got a lot more in my repertoire apart from adverts, they've stolen more than you realise: your time, your peace, your self-worth. Be less pleased about it. You haven't explained anything, you've just continually ignored **everything** because \"It's just an app bro\" - Jesus wept. It is just an app, why on earth did you think you needed to explain it?",

This is not in your interest or the devs, this is in the interest of shareholders who contributed no labour, but expect a share of the profits - if any of this is new, may I recommend you read some critical theory about how capitalism exploits you and everyone around you (even the shareholders making money out of this) - because nobody wants to beg, and these people are doing work, they shouldn't have to. Look outside if you need any inspiration, everyone is working all the time and struggling to afford rent/food/shelter - there is a systemic issue causing this, it's not \"Alarm app bad for having adverts\" - it's that there is a literal war on consciousness to drive a bullshit economy and you are the product, not the consumer.",

I\u2019d wake up 3 hours late, all my alarms disabled and no memory of what had happened. I had this issue for a couple of years and then one day I missed out a really important exam thanks to this issue. So far this app is the only thing that has helped. It does not deserve the hate. This watch an ad to snooze screen only appears if you snoozed through all your snoozes that you\u2019ve set yourself of which you can set an unlimited amount if you want to. This is honestly a fair add to have in a phone app given that the app is free to use. Sure you can subscribe to \u201cpremium\u201d for some extra choices of morning challenges so choose from and som other features but you get more than you\u2019ll need for free.\n\nI\u2019m happy for you for not having this issue but for me and probably many other it\u2019s so hard to wake up that I fear I won\u2019t be able to hold down a job when I get out of university. A free and reliable tool like this app is a life saver and it doesn\u2019t deserve this borderline rage bait slander post. \n\n(Although please do away with the subscription bullshit. Easy to sign subscriptions that every single online company try to push on to you are exploitative as all hell and I\u2019m not going to pretend that that shouldn\u2019t be illegal. But we are going to criticise, let\u2019s at least target the things worthy of being criticised)",
