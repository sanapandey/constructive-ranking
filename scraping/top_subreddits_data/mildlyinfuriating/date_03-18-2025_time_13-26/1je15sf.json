If they already had potential access to my 2SV, they would also have access to potential purchase history, since it's all under the same email address. So they can easily find the first question, and if that welcome mail was still in my inbox, they had that information as well. This just creates a situation where no one will ever recover a lost password or anyone with the 2SV can recover it. It's just a stupid unnecessary extra step that will lock you out of your account (forever) after 3 failed attempts.",
