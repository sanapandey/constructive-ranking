    "selftext": "My Aunt, whom I haven't seen in at least 20 years, sent a FB message at 7pm tonight. I have only texted with her a few times over the last year. She asks how far X major city is from me (an hour). She then texts me that her son (in his 60s), that I met once 30 years ago, is visiting the area with his wife and teen daughter. She then mentions how much her grand daughter would love to see my farm/animals. \n\nMy husband and I work demanding full time jobs. We are not able to drop everything and have people out to our home in the middle of the work week. Our house is not guest ready nor do I have the time/energy to make my home and farm guest ready. \n\nWhen I do have guests I expect to have notice and for us to do the inviting.  \n\nAfter telling the aunt that we have work tomorrow she replied a few hours later with her sons phone number so I can call them... \n\nI would be happy to meet for dinner in town some where but I am not having strangers out to my home with 0 notice. \n\n\n\n",

Put it in context: prior to 30 years ago, relatives and friends used postal mail to catch up with each other.  Both my parents have 4 siblings, all four of my grandparents  had at least six, as did all 8 of my greats. With a new highway system after WWII in the US, people became much more mobile. Though my grandparents\u2019 siblings all stayed in the area, their kids moved up to the city to get good jobs.  Some moved out of state. Some even moved out of the country.  Flying was expensive then. In short, after centuries of families all congregating in the same area, we were able to rapidly disperse across the nation and the world. As a kid I remember my mom\u2019s family having a \u201crolling family letter\u201d. The older sister would write a letter about the current goings-on and send it to her next younger sister. That sister would add a letter and resend it to the next younger sibling.  When the youngest sibling got it, his letter, along with the others, was sent to his oldest sister, who would take her letter out and write a new one and send the remaining letters . One full round of letters took 4 or 5 weeks. \n\nSo imagine now that these brothers and sisters, now scattered all over the country. So far away from each other, long distance phone calls being extremely expensive. I remember in the 70s, eight year-old me was startled when some random station wagon would come rattling up the gravel road to our house. My mom would come out on the porch, wiping her hands on her apron, looking puzzled; and then shriek, running down the steps to the car as one of her sisters or brothers got out with their family.  There were tears and laughter. Everyone had a place to sleep, sometimes on the floor. My sister and I were usually relegated to the barn, but then so were my cousins who, oftentimes, were complete strangers to me. Although it felt a bit awkward to me, I understood the love, the sense of family. \n\nThis also happened with old family friends because, face it: when your family grew in one place for 100 years, there were long running friendships with other settled families in that area. Some were akin to family. Others were people to avoid.  These friends would show up, often unannounced, but welcomed nonetheless. \n\nSeveral of my grandparents are still alive and most of my great aunts and uncles are too\u2014most in their 80s and nineties.  Even now, in 2025, I\u2019ll still get a call from one of them, telling me that one of their kids or grandkids (my cousin) is going to be in my area in a few days and that we should get together \u201cfor a spell\u201d. Following my upbringing I do whatever I can to oblige.  We Almost always meet this new cousin and his family at a local restaurant, enjoy a meal and a conversation, and send them on their way.  Sometimes we extend an offer for them to spend the night, but truly my generation and younger feel more inclined to just get a hotel nearby and continue with our journey rather than imposing.\n\nMy gut feeling is as these elders die, those phone calls announcing relatives in the area are going die off as well. As will the familial links to generations of cousins and family friends.  It\u2019s somewhat sad. But I understand the annoyance of feeling obligated to entertain near strangers at the drop of a hat.\n\nI truly believe this is just a holdover of a time before people could be so easily mobile, geographically. \n\n(As a side note, I was at my grandmother\u2019s house a few weeks ago (she\u2019s 96), when she got a FaceTime call from my cousin\u2019s _granddaughter_, who just had a baby the week before.  Seeing my grandmother just beaming, holding that phone inches from her eyes, looking through thick glasses at her precious new great-great grand daughter brought tears to my eyes. Especially knowing that my grandmother will never get to Japan to meet her.)",

I know this because she mentioned something specific I wrote in one of the notes. So, so weird.",

Our first chore was to get up a fence and a gate, put up \"No Trespassing\" signs every 25 feet, get very visible cameras erected. and make sure our big, burly, surly-looking dog (who is anything but surly, he's a hyper lovebug who thinks the whole world loves him) is seen roaming the yard and looking for visitors to eat.\n\nWhy?  I WANT that farm to look inhospitable. I WANT it to look like we don't want casual visitors...Because really, we don't.  We won't have time to drop everything and spend the entire afternoon sipping coffee with Great-Aunt Elvie while she reminisces about people who died forty years ago, then trying in vain to hustle her out the door so I can start dinner while ignoring her hints that we can feed her, too. I grew up on that farm, and even if I've forgotten half the things I learned on it, I remember this: you're in motion from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall exhausted into bed.  As my grandfather oft said, \"You're tired?  You can rest when you're dead, the livestock needs you to go shove some hay out the loft.\"\n\n\"Southern hospitality\" is often erroneously equated with \"voluntary parasitism\", and if you have family parasites, yeah, they're going to assume several things about  someone on a farm: you have more than enough food because you grow it, you have more than enough time because it's a 'leisurely' life, you have more than enough room because farmhouses traditionally are large, and you have more than enough hospitality because your rural location means you're going to be excited to get any visitors at all.\n\nDang it all, get out of my swamp.",
