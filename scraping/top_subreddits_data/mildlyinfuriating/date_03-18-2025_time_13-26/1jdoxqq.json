Even so, the company will deliver a new model of one of our other machines for the inconvenience at that time. Though it'll be at the expense of increased general maintenance costs for the next 18 or so years as it gets properly broken in and reaches its optimized working age (age may vary; no guarantees). This new device unfortunately does not come with an instruction manual.\n\nHope this clears up any questions. Have a nice day!",

In fact, there's an urban legend about the same.  \n\n>Once upon a time, in Germany, a toothpaste factory had a problem: Due to the way the production line was set up, sometimes empty boxes were shipped without the tube inside. People with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming off of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which cannot be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean quality assurance checks must be smartly distributed across the production line so that customers all the way down to the supermarket won\u2019t get frustrated and purchase another product instead.\n\n>Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory gathered the top people in the company together. Since their own engineering department was already stretched too thin, they decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem.\n\n>The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP (request for proposal), third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later a fantastic solution was delivered \u2014 on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. The problem was solved by using high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box would weigh less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box off the line, then press another button to re-start the line.\n\n>A short time later, the CEO decided to have a look at the ROI (return on investment) of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. There were very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. \u201cThat was some money well spent!\u201d he said, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.\n\n>The number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. How could that be? It should have been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers indicated the statistics were indeed correct. The scales were NOT picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.\n\n>Perplexed, the CEO traveled down to the factory and walked up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before the scale, a $20 desk fan was blowing any empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. Puzzled, the CEO turned to one of the workers who stated, \u201cOh, that\u2026One of the guys put it there \u2019cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang!\u201d",

Quality control only pulls the first X amount of product when a new lot starts, random intervals throughout, and a section at the end. All kinds of shit can happen in the middle. But the literally can't check every single can. \n\nFunny story. When I worked at Pfizer they hired some temp workers to manually check product visually as it came down the line through the anaconda (long package transport conveyor from machine a to machine b. About 6 inches wide and really long.) \n\nQuality pulled some product off the line and went to test it. They cam e out and shut the line down almost immediately. They called the supervisors into the quality room and then they came out and had all of us line up. \n\nThen they informed us that they found a half sucked on red Jolly Rancher type candy inside one of the packages sitting on the blister card. They then had all of us stick out our tongues as they went by and inspected our tongues one by one. The two girls had bright red tongues and were fired on the spot. \n\nIn the time between quality checks we probably Wan 10,000 individually packaged units. Out of those 10,000 or so they pulled 20 individual packages to check for consistency and accuracy and all that. They just so happened to pull the one that had the jolly rancher in it. \n\nWe didn't know how the candy got in the package. It was assumed they did it as a joke. If my math is t right that's about a 0.2% chance they got caught. Had they not got caught then someone sitting at home would have opening up their package to find a crusty jolly rancher sitting on their meds.",
