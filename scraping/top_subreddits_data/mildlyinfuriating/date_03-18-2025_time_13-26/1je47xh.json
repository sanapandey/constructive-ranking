I was relaxing getting an hour long pedicure at the salon a couple weeks ago \u2014 I was the only customer there; it was quiet with soothing instrumental music playing. I was so relaxed I was damn near falling asleep. About 15 minutes in, this lady walks in, tech starts her pedicure, then lady jumps on a fucking work call **on speaker phone.** There had to have been about 6 people on the call. Lasted the entire duration of my hour-long pedicure appointment and I could still hear her while I was getting my acrylics refilled in the next room. That\u2019s the one hour I get to myself every 2 weeks where I can relax and nothing is expected of me. I definitely daydreamed about drowning her in her foot water.",
