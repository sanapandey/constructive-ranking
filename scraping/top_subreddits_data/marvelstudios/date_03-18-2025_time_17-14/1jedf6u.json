But it is so obvious that Jackman and Reynolds will be a significant part of Avengers.  A hero shot of them alongside Evans, Holland, Maguire, RDJ and the like will print money\n\nThis is the one and only chance Marvel has got to bring all these actors from various MCU/Fox/Sony IPs into one story and they know it.  Granted, I do see Reynolds & Jackman sticking around after Secret Wars, they can exist in their own little R-rated corner of the MCU while the new X-Men do their thing",
