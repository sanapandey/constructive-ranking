I\u2019d love for them to have time on their own and know each other and ask each other stuff but still have a main focus on what\u2019s going on in their lives. \n\nI just rewatched defenders and I gotta say I really loved it but Karen, Trish and to a lesser extent Misty just kinda felt half assed and not well done. I think it would be hard to have any focus on their personal lives if they only existed in a team up show",

Maybe do 6 and 6 and spread it out across 2 storylines. \n\nThe trick is that it isn\u2019t a Luke Cage revival for 1 season, or Jessica Jones, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s all of them, but not everyone is in every story or even every season. \n\nMake each season 2-3 stories, kinda like an anthology series. \n\nIt lets them have a Danny & Luke story as the main plot in Eps 1-3, and then in EPS 4-6 they are a B-plot. Vice versa Daughters of the Dragon, etc\n\nMaybe Luke shows up in Eps 7-9 as part of a Jessica story, but not Danny, etc\n\nThere are enough street level heroes from the Netflix shows, and then sprinkle in appearances or even whole story arcs with Blade, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Spidey characters (probably not Spidey himself because of Sony), Echo, either Hawkeye, etc\n\nThere are tons of actors who say they\u2019d love to come back, but with the directive to pare back the Disney+ shows, they aren\u2019t all going to get individual shows. \n\nBut bring back Colter to play Cage in 6 episodes a year, etc seems much more doable.",
