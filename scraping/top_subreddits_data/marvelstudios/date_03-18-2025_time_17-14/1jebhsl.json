But just bringing back Charlie and Vince was going to do that, so even the most reasonable interpretation still makes the whole idea seem stupid. It's also just a bad idea, anyway. I know some people like Waids run, but overall, Daredevils' continued success across decades is because of Millers gritty noir version of the character. The netflix show gave that to fans and brought new fans in based on that concept. Gained a substantial following and ended with so much left in the tank. I don't know why you would even want to fix something that was so clearly not broken, especially considering they had the right to put the netflix show on their streamer. They could have re-released the first three seasons and built up hype for the return. Instead, they gave themselves a seasons worth of footage they had to awkwardly build a rebooted fourth season around. This whole thing has been grossly mismanaged.",

Maybe they initially were heading in the old school direction but had already decided to ease that off once Born again started production, and that's where I'm getting confused?
