Before he was jaded he was probably enlisted in part due to the propaganda made around Captain America. After becoming the Punisher, he probably assumed Cap was full of shit and disillusioned. But after being in the hero/anti-hero game for a while and interacting with him enough personally, he sees Steve really is the guy he was made out to be. An island worthy of respect in Castle's ocean of cynicism. Frank killing villains on their team in Civil War, then refusing to defend himself against Captain America's retaliation is such a perfect character moment.\n\nI bet they'll use some version of that famous \"Captain America would be happy to have you\" panel this season--it's both iconic and relevant to the times. But Frank is definitely going to take out a ton of them too. I don't think they should lean in too hard to Frank and Captain America in the show though, since the characters have never interacted on screen. The relationship doesn't mean as much if it's just Frank fanboying his favorite superhero celebrity, instead of someone who he personally knows as a man of character.",

Every single other MCU property including black widow, the dark world, love and thunder, and the other mid movies offered me some entertainment of some sort that I could enjoy. \n\nShe hulk was just a comedy that was very rarely funny (madisyn was great) and its story was completely disinteresting. Madisyn and Daredevil were the only saving graces of a show I felt was otherwise relentlessly boring, unfunny, and underwhelming. This is coming from someone who enjoyed the marvels and ant man quantumania. \n\nSecret invasion was worse because it was also relentlessly boring but didn\u2019t have a single redeeming factor.",

Admittedly, we're watching a case in compressed time, but what's fascinating is they try him on murder 1 and murder 2 without motive. They also try him on manslaughter instead of INVOLUNTARY manslaughter.\n\n\nHis motive actually never comes up in the episode, the DA frames the moment as a man doing a bad thing during closing argument, but never actually gets into why he supposedly did it. He parades cops onto the witness stand, appeals to emotions on the jury and frames a crowd of cops behind him.\u00a0\n\n\nIn a real life court room an actual good defense attorney would smell blood in the water.\n\n\nThe cop witness here, the only one on the platform that admits to it is CAUGHT lying by Nicky, who while he establishes he wasn't on the platform, points out that he does know the cop, and that screws up his credibility as a witness.\n\n\nBECAUSE of that, you have a case without motive on counts that require motive with a witness caught lying on the stand, which ultimately means all Matt has to do is counter with character witnesses, which he DOES.\n\n\nIs that enough to get a full acquittal? Idk, there's always cop sympathizers on a jury, and this isn't my field of law. In real life this probably wouldn't have gone to trial this way either, so give them a little leeway.\n\n\nYou should also know that in criminal law the legal onus to prove the charges is always on the prosecution, or else you're not supposed to bring a case forward. All you need to do to dodge a charge in criminal law is shoot holes in the proof. The only proof presented is 1 witness and a bunch of character witnesses for a dead man, which doesn't make white tiger look all that guilty? The burden of proof just isn't on their side during the episode.\n\n\nBut these are the wrong counts, so even at absolute worst for Matt Murdoc its a mistrial.",

If Torres had never approached these officers or escalated or fought back when they were just doing their duty, a good man would still be alive today.\"\n\nPainting it as manslaughter would put Torres in prison still and make him a pariah for life if he ever got out.

It's still ones word against the other and should never be enough to convict for murder. So I'm glad they didn't go that way, had Hector acquitted, only for him to be executed by Not-Punisher.",

This plotline is mostly taken from the \"The Trial of the Century\" storyline from Bendis's run in the early 2000s.  The details are a little different (Hector loses the trial, freaks out and tries to run, and is gunned down by cops.  Evidence comes out after his death that exonerates him) but the basic premise of Matt representing Hector and him being shot after the trial is the same.",

However, with the witness turning on him there was no other play than to make the jury believe that his guy is more deserving of trust than the cop. This would normally be impossible but he had knowledge of him being a vigilante so he used that in a reckless manner betting that if he introduced White Tiger and all he had done the jury would trust him more than they would a cop, especially since he could cite other police officers praising him. In Summary, without the cop bonus the DA didnt have much of a case so he did the best he could do with his closing argument which is to try and shatter that trust matt built up. In the end he did not succeed with that.\n\nNow whether a case would really go forward without evidence like that I dont know. But in the context of the show it works.",

All Matt had to do was ask \u201cDid you ever work for this man as a confidential informant?\u201d and point to the cop, and then some follow-up questions about their work together. Nicky wasn\u2019t present for the cop\u2019s testimony, so he would have no clue that the cop lied about knowing him in the first place. So Nicky would have no reason to lie about that part because he was worried about backlash from the cops. I was so frustrated when Matt stopped questioning Nicky, because that seemed obvious to me. \n\nAlso, I feel like there had to be some sort of paper trail with Nicky being a confidential informant that could\u2019ve been subpoenaed (like, at least some texts or calls between him and that cop), but tbh I don\u2019t understand how all that works legally.

But he eventually accidentally kills a liquor store robber by going on patrol while injured and not being at his best. Just accidentally punches the guy too hard.\n\nHe only finds out the guy is dead later after the police find the body, and for a while it's like Matt knows he lives in a comic book because he starts investigating it on the assumption that somebody's framing him. Like \"maybe Kingpin found the guy after I left and killed him so that I'd get blamed for it\" or \"maybe Mysterio has hypnotized me into thinking I did it when in fact I was never even there\" etc. And because it's a comic book, you actually think that maybe that might actually be the case. But slowly it becomes painfully obvious that no, it's not a trick, he just got reckless and it finally caught up to him.\n\nWhat follows is one of the best DD storylines I've ever read and involves virtually every superhero in NYC weighing in on the issue. [Frank even drops by for an \"attaboy\".](https://i0.wp.com/www.comicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Daredevil-4-Art-Custom.jpg?resize=520%2C800)",

When we see the remake/continuation of something announced, faithful often rejoice and exclaim immediately about how they either want the same exact as previous or something with just a few minor changes.  And for what it's worth, I can't blame them.  I too was a diehard omega fan of the original, and often we as fans just want more of that.  But from an artist's standpoint, I also recognize the importance of putting your own flavor on something, your own colors and shades.  There's enough of this show that absolutely feels familiar to the original, but also enough that I can appreciate and respect the continuation for being its own thing with its own designs.  The original Netflix series will ALWAYS be there for diehard fans to go back and watch, for all eternity.  I personally thought this episode was brilliant, the slow burn and emotionally heavy stage was exactly the kind of thing I thirst for.  I know in time, the action will be there.  But for now, I fucking love that Matt Murdock is absolutely trying to do it this way within the confines of the law.  Genuine 10/10 episode for me.",

I know that it was supposed to be more lighthearted, so there is that. I thought maybe the ending disproved that initially, but then I suddenly remembered that I accidentally saw the set videos of them filming that scene last year, so I guess it really was lighthearted pre-overhaul. So, then that also makes me wonder what Hector would\u2019ve been doing for the rest of the season, if anything, because the ending of this episode was filmed after Kamar\u2019s death. Maybe Hector was going to go to the beach with his family and never be seen again, maybe he would\u2019ve teamed up with Matt later on in the season or beyond that if Kamar was still alive, or maybe they always planned to adapt Hector\u2019s death from the comics, and they just reshot it so they could integrate the corrupt Punisher cops\u2019 subplot into it, since Bernthal apparently rejected returning initially after finding out about the show\u2019s original iteration without Karen and Foggy.\n\nR.I.P. to our Hector Ayala/White Tiger; Kamar de los Reyes.

You could see the juxtaposition as if they are written on the walls. In this episode, Hector's speech about White Tiger being a part of who he is can be directly applied to Matt and Fisk; being Daredevil and Kingpin aren't just a mask or an expandable role play to them, these are who they are deep inside.\n\nI cannot wait to see how both Matt and Fisk eventually revert back to their true self going forward. There is a fine line between refining and rediscovering who someone is and completely rejecting an aspect of someone, and \"born again\" is pointing to the former. Matt will find his way back to the Daredevil, and Fisk will accept his darkness. These two characters are like Batman and Joker, their roles can only reverse temporarily before the balance shifts back.",

They dress like him and go around dispensing their own justice including going after those that cross them (regardless of innocence). The purpose is so that those killings get pinned on Frank Castle and is never traced back to them. Cops go hunt a man that\u2019s always off the grid and hard to find, plus who would ever believe him.!<\n\nMy theory for episode 4 >! is that CCTV footage caught the image of the Punisher, unclear facial recognition, and Murdock is going to go after him.

So far DD:BA is immediately a completely different vibe than the original show and I'm going to miss the show we had in season 3. I'm curious how this season goes. I'm not in love with this show yet, but the original show tended to take its time setting up different plots to pay off mid way through the season so I'm definitely intrigued to see where this goes. I hope it was worth it to kill off Foggy, because so far I'm not sure why that creative choice was made. I would have liked to see Foggy and Karen return, but even Karen has seemingly exited the show(maybe she'll be back??) and she was my favorite from the original.\n\nAlso just gotta say, there were rumors about the direction this show was going to take, and then supposedly reshoots happened and the plot went through some major changes. I remember hearing they planned to kill off Foggy and Karen, and most of the first season would be courtroom drama. So far, that's more or less what this is. So I'm curious if they actually really changed the plot \ud83e\udd14",

So I think he is making a good job considering the restrictions he has had. I trust that by the end of the season all will make sense. >!Both actors are confirmed for season 2, so we know we'll see them again. I don't know about Foggy in what capacity, may be flashbacks, or that we might learn that he is not dead after all. About Karen, the showrunner has said that she is \"the heart and soul of this universe, of this Daredevil mythology\", and I very much agree with that. Plus.

Matt's trying to convince himself he doesn't want to be daredevil contrasts with Hector being like \"nah, white tiger is who i am.\" I always thought it was weird that Fisk called Daredevil Matt's darker half, but I think maybe his arc is him realizing that's not the case. Yes, he may use his anger by being a superhero but he it's balanced by his heroism and compassion. Grace and retribution. He's only human. I wonder what his breaking point will be. He still wants to believe in the law, but it's flawed and Fisk is in power.\n\nIt's poetic that Hector continued to be White Tiger despite having his identity leaked. Of course he would, it's the right thing to do... and he's executed for it. I actually like that it was done so suddenly. You feel it's a happy ending then BAM. Matt's recklessness had consequences, showing why masks can be good.\n\nOne thing I'm not sure about is New York being portrayed as this crime ridden, lawless place because cops are quitting the force and vigilantes are what's fighting back. I don't have a point yet, but it feels a little weird. Also, I hope the punisher subplot isn't dragged out. The new Ultimates comic were able to talk about a similar topic in one issue.

The mask is literally his only identity. Going after Fisk with Daredevil would've  been so insane to see. \n\nCorporate bullshit interfering with art is bullshit man. I don't want to come off as a whiny baby because I truly am grateful we're getting more Daredevil, but seeing the Daredevil/Spider-Man team up for this season just feels fitting. Matt running from his mask while Peter would be fighting to keep his would've been a great dynamic.\n\nRant over.\n\nThis show is phenomenal so far.

Nebula was even the one who kills Thanos at the end. We didn't get that in the MCU. The Born Again storyline was actually used for Daredevil S3, and the current show is just using the name. The White Tiger plot is from an entirely different comic.\n\nComic readers are just in the dark as anyone else. Only difference is that they have an educated guess rather than a random one.

However, the decision of Matt to expose his identity really left a bad taste in my mouth and comes across as very out of character, especially since the whole series is kicked off by a consequence of Matt identity being known by someone. I get that Matt did this in part as a criticism of himself, but I believe he would still be conscious of the potential consequences. There was still a chance Hector could go to prison even after his identity was revealed, and things would be much worse in there than if Matt didn't reveal his identity at all. Not to mention his family will not have to live in constant fear for their lives. Overall baffling decision.\n\nAlso, White Tiger had a super lame death. Why is this bright white vigilante just bumbling around the streets with no situational awareness? How was he not killed before?",

Then we have Kingpin and Vanessa just always arguing and disagreeing but we haven't seen how they got to that point. Wilson was an absolute simp in the Netflix series, he would do ANYTHING to keep Vanessa happy and she would support every single thing he did without a question.\n\n\nNow we start this series and they just seem on the verge of divorce, and we know this because they told us, they haven't SHOWN us. We can't care if we don't see how they got to this point.\n\n\nSo it just seems like Disney is happy to exposition dump its way to bridge the gap, whereas the Netflix show always made effort to show not tell. And that makes Born Again immediately inferior.\n\n\nAlso, was White Tiger supposed to die there? Or did they kill him off due to the actors death?

S1 ends here.\n\nFisk will put Daredevil in the \"Devil in Cell Block D\" situation, being locked up with Bullseye and other villains, maybe Melvin Potter (prison name \"Gladiator\") and Scorpion. Frank will get himself locked up to talk to Matt, and the story progresses as normal.\n\nWhen Matt gets out, we kick into Devil's Reign with a pinch of Devil Takes a Ride, with Luke, Jessica, Spider-Man and others fighting Fisk while Matt goes on an excursion to find Mr Fear's helping Fisk gain support (and Lily Lucca will smell like Heather, obvs).\n\nAlso, I think the reason Karen didn't talk to Matt is that she knows Foggy's alive, and so is Elektra, because she revived him with hand magic. It's why Matt caught her heartbeat after Bullseye's trial.",

Trying to make Daredevil fits into MCU just seems forced.\n\nOne example imo, is daredevil appearing in the She hulk episode which to me it's just seemed out of place.\n\ni know people love that episode because he elevated the series, this just highlights how superior the Daredevil universe is compared to the current state of the MCU.\n\nI used to think everything has to tie to Avengers because that was the golden age of MCU, where Avenger and the infinity wars was the hype, but clearly the MCU is on the downtrend, and it's more of a liability now.",

I like his series but it\u2019s very far removed from what the punisher actual motivations are. He doesn\u2019t only do his vigilante shenanigans because outside forces make him do it, he\u2019s supposed to be always avenging his family\u2019s death by taking it out on all criminals. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of weird they\u2019re portraying these cops idolizing him when Frank himself has only been punishing criminals when it was specific to his family or he unwillingly put himself into situations that brought him into conflict with criminals. \n\nThe only hint we had he\u2019ll continue to be a vigilante full time was the ending of season 2 but with the trailers of Jon Bernthal so far, it looks like he\u2019s retired/in hiding. He looks just like he did at the beginning of punisher season 1 when he finished his crusade against the people that killed his family in daredevil season 2. I\u2019m happy to see him but I hope they don\u2019t rehash this again by having Frank once again come out of retirement one last time",

The Kingpin is responsible for the Frank Castle escape and the corruption of Benjamin Poindexter or Bullseye (and by extension the control of the FBI). \n\nAlternatively if those cops have nothing to do with Fisk aside from enmity towards him, those Punisher Cops might be extremists upholding their vision of the law to the detriment of the public in practice.\n\nOn an unrelated note, Fisk going to BB Urich denouncing the Hector Ayala verdict is pretty much is his buying a page ad moment.",

Matt outing Hector's identity as a cheap shot shows how desperate he is to win and might as well be an indication that he is inching towards breaking his integrity as a civilian to save those in need, just like Fisk is employing his old tactics that betray his new found higher goals. Also, I'm expecting a lot of guilt tripping and shaming to come across his way for getting Hector in the crosshairs of the police by both Soledad and Fisk, which must urge him to reconsider becoming Daredevil, since the lawyer and the law cannot save people at night. We'll see how things pan out. I'm expecting more of the devil to come.\n\nAlso, some Frank guy is gonna have a royal crashout with that ending.\n\nI'll also wanna see if it's Fisk supporting these Punisher themed cops from the sidelines to pull off a double entendre- pushing the anti vigilante propaganda to piss Matt and the people in support, and also earning the support of such cops, and I'm also curious to see if Matt goes out to chase The Punisher in a fit of misunderstanding because he'd be mad to learn about the guy seeming to runn a gang of loose cops.",

I really liked the conclusion to the White Tiger storyline (despite it being sad asf\u2014Hector deserved so much better), and the Punisher storyline tease was HYPE. Also, I loved all of the subtle details to Matt's character, namely the way the courthouse seems to mirror the church for him, as well as his quiet grief over Foggy. Speaking of, I still miss the original cast and their absence is definitely felt, but knowing that they're coming back soonish to a show of this quality excites me to no end.

Honestly if it was a case of them originally going with the comic ending of him getting shot on the court steps I could see them changing it to a costume scene just so the actors last scene on film wasn't him getting gunned down",

At some point (I have it screenshotted at 11:45 for timestamp) you see the camera focus on someone sitting behind Matt and Hector, and i'm 95% it's Thomas Jane. There's a reason why we weren't shown Frank's face after Hector got blown away. Because it's not the Frank/Punisher we're expecting. With Fisk's comment about vigilantes w/ skulls and spiders on their chests, and then the Punisher tag art outside that one safe house (plus knowledge that Bernthal will be in the series in some way) I feel like it's all leading up to some big misdirect that may pit Bernthal and Jane's respective Punishers against each other.",
