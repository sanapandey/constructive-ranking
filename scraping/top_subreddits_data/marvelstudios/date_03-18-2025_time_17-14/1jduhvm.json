He\u2019s also a great example of untethered power and chaos while Spiderman tends to value precision and control.",

It\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\nMarvel Studios used to be a division directly under the control of Marvel Entertainment alongside Marvel Television. Prior to 2016, all Marvel Television projects were canon and actively were developed as a part of the MCU continuity (hence the crossovers between AoS and The Dark World, The Winter Soldier, and Age of Ultron). During this period, everything is undeniably canon (and Marvel marketing proves this extensively).\n\nAfter 2016, Marvel Studios developed movies directly under Disney, separate from Marvel Entertainment. They still did not have the power to dictate canon, so Marvel Television\u2019s projects remained canon but the two divisions no longer worked together, which is why continuity became an issue when Inhumans got cancelled and became a TV show or AoS never referenced the blip.\n\nIn 2019, Kevin Feige became president of Marvel Entertainment. He gained control of everything, including Marvel Television. The first thing he did was shut down the entire division, and cancel all active projects. This is when the shows became non-canon, because it\u2019s the first time Marvel Studios could actively dictate that.\n\nIt\u2019s worth saying: at no point did Marvel Studios explicitly decanonise anything from Marvel Television. They acted as if all those projects did not exist until Daredevil: Born Again was retooled to include more continuity with The Defenders Saga, but at no point has Marvel said they\u2019re not canon. It\u2019s just that Marvel Studios clearly has not and does not consider them so internally, but publicly every show made by Marvel Television outside of The Defenders Saga, including Agents of SHIELD, Agent Carter, Runaways, Cloak & Dagger, and Inhumans were all officially announced, produced, and aired by Marvel as a part of MCU canon.\n\nSo until Marvel Studios actively says they\u2019re not canon, the last official statement made is that they are. Ergo, not quite as simple as \u201cthey non-canon, and never have been\u201d.",

I know they\u2019re not made by marvel studios, which is such a huge barrier for some people oddly, but it IS Sacred Timeline canon. All of it happened in the same universe where half of life is snapped away. Perhaps it\u2019s the TV-MA ratings, which I\u2019m a bit more ok with for people skipping, some ppl just don\u2019t like R rated content, but man I just want people to enjoy the greatness (damn near perfection in the case of DDs3) that is some of these seasons! \n\nI did the same with Star Wars The Clone Wars. Soooo many people skipped em for being too childish. Slowwwwwly, there\u2019d be post after post \u201comg I had no idea these were so good!\u201d \n\nSimilarly, I\u2019m really hoping when Born Again s1 wraps up, people go back wanting more and realize just how bang on Marvel Television had it, a decade ago. Then maybe more posts will pop up \u201comg I didn\u2019t know it got this good\u201d\n\nI always hope my comments like this convince just one person to give them a watch",

He didn't waste time on bullshit, he respected his enemies, he never lost focus and was able to sacrifice everything he had. Because of that he's a protagonist. He's a main threat.

He was very well flushed out and a real villain that was pretty much unbeatable. In End Game, he was defeated by a snap. They struggled. \n\nGreen Goblin: I was younger when the original Spider-Man came out and I remember how terrifying he was to me. The voice. The laugh. He was so menacing. And he gave Spider-Man a tough time. It really stood out to me. \n\nFisk: as someone who just started binging the Netflix Marvel shows last month (originally started with Daredevil so I can be caught up for Born Again and ended up just watching all in order). I had previously seen him in Echo and Hawkeye, but those series didn\u2019t fully capture how terrifying he is. Seeing him in Daredevil and having multiple episodes to flush him out, he\u2019s a very complex villain. He\u2019s a product of his upbringing, especially being emasculated by his father then killing him to protect his mother. His ability to go from calm and well articulated to just raising his voice and amplifying it instantly while beating and killing people with his bare hands is truly incredible acting.",
