They added Falcon right off the bat. In the Marvel's Avengers video game? We got them for a prequel novel, but other than that, Kamala and Kate were part of the team before Clint rejoined.\n\nI think Hickman's Avengers run after Bendis' arc was the only other comic to use this roster, and just like the game and cartoon, the team was flooded with like 20 other members so it didn't even matter.",
