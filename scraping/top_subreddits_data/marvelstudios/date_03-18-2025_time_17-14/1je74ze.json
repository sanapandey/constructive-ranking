That automatically tells me, he is still Mayor and he is still alive at the end of Season 1.\n\nNot sure if anyone else has felt this way but season 2 already has a lot info out in this Sub even though I am trying to avoid it.",

Trailers weren't made by writers and directors, after all.  \n\nThis topic reminds me of that South Park episode where they redefine the word Fag to describe biker gangs. But based on the evolving nature of language I'm simply wrong because people have chosen to misuse the word.\n\nJustifying it makes for a nice conversation but at the end of the day we are simply excluding people who want to experience the product as it is intended.  And that's simply unfair.  Just because it's not a spoiler for some people doesn't mean it's not a spoiler for other people.\n\nE: actually I misspoke... it is a spoiler for them too, they're just accepting of these spoilers.
