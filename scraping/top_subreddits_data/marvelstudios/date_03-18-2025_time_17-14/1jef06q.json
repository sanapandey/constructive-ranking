Definitely felt that S3 was the strongest with the most gripping plot points for me. However, I did struggle to comprehend the amount of control Fisk was able to have over so many. Maybe that felt drawn out after seeing it happen in S1. \n\nS2 was great as well. I went in completely blind, but at least knew that people generally didn\u2019t enjoy S2. I didn\u2019t understand why til S3. I did enjoy seeing Frank again, his last appearance was kind of strange to me though. \n\nKudos to the team who wrote the dialogue especially in moments between Matt and Stick, The Pastor, and Foggy. I also thought Dex was a great actor and fantastic casting for someone who isn\u2019t familiar with the villains. Completely sold on his deranged villainous persona in S3.",
