    "selftext": "In my opinion I think she's done really well with her character in the MCU so far. Considering the obvious barriers and challenges of both the actress and Echo, she's sold the personality very well & think she has one of the strongest presence's when she's on screen despite having no dialogue in the most common sense. She's got a brashness, an intensity to Echo but then meshes the more emotive side along with that coldness. Whatever the opinions on her show (I liked it), I think Alaqua Cox has been a solid addition and can't wait to see where she can pop up next.",

It does some brilliant character work with Clint (The scene where Kate writes on the pad so Clint can talk to his son is literally one of my favourite bits of any MCU project). The vibe is perfect and I think it adapts the Fraction run via easter eggs so well. We get Fisk back here too. Yelena is AMAZING. And I think it doesn't drop the ball in the finale like quite a few of the MCU shows do. So good.",
