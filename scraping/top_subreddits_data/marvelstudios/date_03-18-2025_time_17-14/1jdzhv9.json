Unless it\u2019s made a point that they are variants you should assume you\u2019re watching the same character.",

The whole joke bit with him was that first you thought he was Cap and then realize he\u2019s Johnny and are happy for the cameo as an unsuspected character but then when he loses to Pyro you realize that he\u2019s not even the Johnny from the original FF movies (plus his costume was slightly different) which is why his death was comical and not as impactful as the rest of the heroes who get their \u201cending/legacy.\u201d Also, 2. He\u2019s definitely weaker. Although physically his body is strong enough to survive the fall, when Johnny was first learning and practicing his powers he easily approached supernova level heat. Pyro is only a level 4 mutant, although he can control existing flames/heat, he\u2019s not strong enough to snuff out a sun. But again, this is all just my thoughts/opinions which can often be wrong lol",
