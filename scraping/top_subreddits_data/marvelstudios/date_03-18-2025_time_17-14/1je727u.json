Set in the same world as Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, have the occasional Peter Parker/Gwen Stacy cameo but let Nico and the gang have another run. And also, lean more on Kris Anka's visual from the 2017 run as FNSM also borrowed Nico's look from that as well.",

Sure, comic fans won't be too interested but the general audience wouldn't care about the character being a or b tier in the comics. They just want a good film. Plus lower tier characters might actually help MCU try out different genres as well.",

But James Gunn did such a great job interpreting them into something accessible, relatable & fun at a time when the MCU's extra-terrestrial exposure was mostly Asgardians and a a few flat villains.",
