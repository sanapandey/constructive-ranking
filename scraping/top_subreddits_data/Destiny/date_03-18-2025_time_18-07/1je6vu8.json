Around woke people you can't say slurs and are expected to respect people's preferred pronouns, around the anti woke you can't use terms like the patriarchy, micro aggressions, cisgender and other actually useful terms. \n\nCensoring hate speech is a whole lot better then censoring science.\n\nThings like banning cisgender from X should get a whole lot more attention then they do they are literally banning scientific terminology, unironically totalitarian dictatorship vibes.",
