    "selftext": "I\u2019m the least conspiratorial person I know IRL but it seems so suspicious that after the election nobody cares about Gaza. The Muslim student group at my school is radio silent and they\u2019re all US citizens. No major protests in Biden\u2019s lame duck months, no protest in response to turning Gaza into a resort, and I\u2019m betting zilch now that Israel has broken the ceasefire and civilian deaths are resuming. \n\nNow maybe it\u2019s the case all the people were screaming about genocide are now just scared of consequences now or suddenly realized that their protesting did basically nothing, but I\u2019m just very frustrated with all these activists who lit the political world on fire for no reason. They said they had every right to disrupt anything because of dying children but now the dying children are less important than their visas. And I\u2019m not ruling out that people who wanted to see the Dems lose in 2024, whether conservative, green or even Israeli fueled the protests and used all those young idealists as useful idiots. Biden was polling just fine before Oct 7. \n\nEdit: many comments saying Russia. Obvious oversight on my part. Probably a little bit of China just for the lulz. ",

They lock in and they try to win no matter what heinous shit Trump or the republicans say or do.\n\nWe need that type of energy to win, yet even now they won\u2019t admit Harris would have been better on Gaza. Instead they\u2019ll say the genocide would have continued under either admin. It\u2019s insane, you can\u2019t win like that when your opponent dgaf about any of the shit their side is doing.",

Absolutely mental, the only thing I can think of is that it must be just the same sort of backfire effect that has people still defending trump after their spouse gets deported or they lose their job or their research grant is cut off or just some action of his directly leads to the ruination of their life. I will say at least now when I get that pushback on larger subs, I'm not the one who gets downvoted anymore. That's a total reversal from 6 months ago. So idk at least the reddit zeitgeist is making contact with reality again. Well. That or. Could be they just turned off the engagement bots. :/",

If Kamala is president, you bet your ass we'd have protests still. And that's not a bad thing either, because ultimately Kamala, **JUST AS SHE DID ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL**, would have addressed it and moved towards their side. The Democrats voters that the far left hate so much *actually* have **empathy** and are willing to peel off here and there to aid in altruistic goals. \n\nRepublican constituents do *not* hold their leaders to the same accountability, and worse, their leaders know that regardless of what their voters say, they're too stupid to vote in their own interests anyways, so they're not reliant on appeasing. So instead you have Republican cohorts that are voting specifically to *make liberals mad* which usually just boils down to:\n\n>\"How can we hurt as many marginalized or 'other' people as possible? Dems hate when we do that, so let's push it to 11!\"\n\nSo now the Gaza protesters are in this **reality** where they can't go and protest because they know that not only will it fall on deaf ears, but the constituents, the objectively larger politically active group, Republicans will laugh and want to double or triple down as a response.\n\nYou went from a party that often times pushes back on their leaders and **ATTEMPTS** to show accountability to a party that **ENABLES and EMPOWERS** their leaders to make decisions that will harm others.\n\nI obviously really hope everything turns out fine, for the sake of innocent life, but god, if / when Gaza is glassed, can these idiots at least make the 2028 talking point a domestic issue?",

Why didn't they start?\n\n>Because Israel attempted to change the terms and refused to move on to phase 2. I swear I've already said this par\n\nWhen did Israel attempt to change the terms? \n\nSo the negotiations never began back in early February. Israel requested a longer ceasefire and to start these negotiations\n\n>No. Israel demanded an extension to phase 1, **while altering the terms**, and refusing to discuss phase 2.\n\nWhen did the Israeli refuse to discuss phase 2? \n\n>Hamas stuck by the deal that had already been negotiated.\n\nPhase 2 wasn't negotiated and they rejected every offer to negotiate. You can't stick to a deal that hasnt been negotiated. \n\n>For some reason people like you are adamant to defend the fascist government of Israel when they've failed at every step\n\nHamas are way more fascist than Israel. \n\nWhat deal has Hamas offered? Why have they rejected all deals including those brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the US?\n\n>What? Hamas offered the deal that **both sides had agreed to**. The deal brokered by the US. Saying they rejected all deals is a rejection of reality\n\nPhase 1 was agreed to. What part of it did Israel reject? \n\n>The Israeli government was adamant about that by refusing to have any sort of plan, completely failing to defeat hamas, and refusing all alternate plans for governance of Gaza.\u00a0\n\nYes. Hamas can 1) die 2) surrender 3) leave. They have chosen to fight. Good luck. \n\n>Why is that the fascists defenders *always* love doing this little projection game with \"people like you\". Genuinely incapable of dealing with the facts at hand\n\nWhy do dip shits like you always defend Hamas when they cause endless suffering to Palestinians. You are not pro Palestinian. You are simply a terrorist simp. \n\nWhy do you use chat gpt to argue with people on reddit? Too lazy to fully write your own responses. What great advocacy. \n\n>The Israeli government is the one causing direct suffering to the Palestinians. They openly want to commit an ethnic cleansing against the civilian population. Your virtue signalling is meaningless because you will defend the fascists to your last breath\n\nHamas is causing direct suffering to the Palestinians. They openly what to commit genocide against the civilian population in Israel. Your virtue signalling is disgusting and does nothing but further the suffering of Palestinians. \n\nWhat gives you the right to advocate for islamist control of Gazans? Why do Gazans deserve a future ruled by Hamas?",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 2 March that Israel had accepted a plan by US envoy Steve Witkoff \u201cto extend the temporary ceasefire by 50 days\u201d to discuss the second stage.\n\nIsrael and US attempt to extend ceasefire to negotiate next steps.\n\n>Netanyahu said that under the plan, half of the remaining hostages would be released straight away, and the remainder released if an agreement was reached.\n\nIsrael seeks to secure release of **hostages still held in Gaza.**\n\n>Hamas said it rejected Israel\u2019s attempt to extend the first stage, calling it \u201ca blatant attempt to evade the agreement and avoid entering into negotiations for the second phase\u201d.\n\nHamas refuses to negotiate the second phase \u2026 by accusing Israel of avoiding negotiations. This obviously makes no sense to anybody with 2 neurons, a 7th-grade reading level, or a modicum of sympathy for Jews.\n\nAnyway, Hamas doesn\u2019t care if the war resumes and never did. Why would they support a ceasefire? Let\u2019s see if their cynical tactics work for them.\n\nAs for you: stick to Star Wars if this galaxy is too confusing for you.",

On the 2d left-right political spectrum, these people are all closer to the democrats, and the democratic party may be persuaded to seek their support by appeasing these groups. As democrats are the only party they might influence, protesting is only really effective when the democrats are in power.\n\nAlso, these people don't care about the state of America, and that their unhinged Hamas-support and attacks against the democrats hurt the democratic party and favors the republicans. If anything, republicans winning will likely lead to America's fall from grace which in the long-term will be positive for Palestine (in their opinion), even if the Palestinians will suffer more in the short term.",
