And that's because so many immigrants avoid playing taxes like the plague, don't work in high value added jobs (which means that they don't pay that many taxes), oh, and there's this little problem with immigrants: they're people, which means they age. Coupled with the fact immigrants don't actually have as many children as people tend to think, and you get an even worse demographic pyramid in the medium and long terms - because with immigration you're adding even more people at the top, but not many at the bottom as you would need (in fact the bottom of the demo pyramid remains mostly unchanged).\n\nThe only way to solve the social security crisis is to increase birth rates, and only Argentina, out of all countries has actually figured out how to do that.",

They always have the same line too \"I really hope you prove me wrong\" or some shit like that when they already have this made up solution to a made up problem.\n\nWhat I just dont get is how they dont understand what bringing low level, low cost manufacturing back to the US would do. Who the hell is going to work in these places? The answer cannot be Americans, as Steven pointed out we are at 5% unemployment. So they either want other industries to shut down and do a communist style transfer of workforce into another industry or they magically think 20 million unborn americans are going to sprout like trees from our industrial plants and 100% of them all want to be low wage sweat shop workers. I guess another option would be using Mexico as a slave nation and only let in enough workers to fill these jobs but not as americans, as low wage mexicans who have no rights, no fair pay and are monitored 24/7.\n\nI know the 2nd one is hyperbolic but honestly the latter of those are feeling to be true. They are in the process of kicking out every person they can find that is not a citizen regardless of legal status or not (even citizens if their parents are not citizens), they want the borders completely shut down with no exchange of peoples, no exchange of commerce with the tariffs. So with my tin foil hat on, it would seem they are setting up for tons of people to work in these low wage manufacturing jobs, either as a failed economy that has no choice but to relive the early 1900s or have a chinese style Uyghur population living under a military state with no rights (central and south americans)",
