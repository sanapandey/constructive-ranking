I'm fully sold that one of the biggest mistakes his cabinet and the rest of the executive/legislative branches made in his first term was not letting him hang himself with some of his stupid decisions.\n\nIf you want to select the least damaging things in the long term but most politically damaging great, but the issue with this country is our institutions got too good at protecting us from ourselves. We learned that if you chuck rocks at the glass it will not break, so we started chucking boulders instead. You have to let your kid play on a playset where they can hurt themselves if they do dumb shit, or else they'll do some really dumb shit and get themselves killed later. The American people are children who've never hurt themselves before",

People being so accustomed to the freedom and prosperity offered by liberalism, and forgetting that it is not a natural state of policial existence, but something that just 80 years ago was won with immeasurable sacrifices by the generations that didn't have the comfort we have enjoyed throughout our lives. I don't understand how people can be so lacking in their historical perspective. News flash: history is not something that is continuously moving towards further liberty and prosperity in a linear fashion. This kind of thinking neuters liberals, removes all sense of agency, and allows us to continue to pretend that core liberal principles are something apolitical, something of a foregone conclusion that is just always gonna be there for us.",
