Has something to do with where the fire started and whether there is evidence the fire could have started on it's own from that location. For example, if this fire started on the tire of from a bag sitting below the car, then it's pretty clear it was set off by someone. But if it started in the battery and there's evidence that there was a chemical reaction, then it's almost certainly an accident. Unless, of course, there is an intentional looking hole in the battery that caused the chemical reaction.",
