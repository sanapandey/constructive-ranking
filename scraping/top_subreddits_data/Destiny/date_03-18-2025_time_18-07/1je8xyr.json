SCOTUS gave him presumptive immunity and Congress just gave him the power of the purse. \n\nThese aren\u2019t just fantasy terms like a Palantir, these are real powers that the country spent a lot of fucking time and effort siloing off from a single individual ever having because the end result of someone having all of these abilities is trivially easy to anticipate as being a really fucking bad time.\n\nFor Constitutional scholars they all seem really surprised that the thing that is constantly brought up in all scholarly discussions of the Constitution as a really bad idea that should be avoided at all cost, is turning out to be a really bad idea",
