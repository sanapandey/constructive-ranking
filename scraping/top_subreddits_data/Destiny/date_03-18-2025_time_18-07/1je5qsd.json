Balance making them feel good with good questions. Use nicer phrasing like when you're trying to criticize a mentally deficient child.\n\nFirst get the temporary passes to get their foot in the door. Schmooze the president and his dumb c*nt press secretary. Get better status. Then start asking harder and harder hitting questions nicely. Bam, you're basically a double agent journalist. \n\nHire SMART hot men and women and they'll probably get access super fast. Some 10/10 chads and stacies right out of a giga liberal journalism school. Hell, hire some fucking actors and just train them on what to say. Keep questions simple, get your answer and move on. Don't press them when they're wrong. Give the wrong answers to another journalist and have them fact check and write out the story so your name doesn't get attached to it.\n\nI have no idea how journalism works but the White House is probably so incompetently staffed right now that this might work.",
