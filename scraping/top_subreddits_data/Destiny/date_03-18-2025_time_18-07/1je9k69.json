Participants were categorized into quartiles based on their butter or plant-based oil intake. After adjusting for potential confounders, the highest butter intake was associated with a 15% higher risk of total mortality compared to the lowest intake.\n* There was a statistically significant association between higher intakes of canola, soybean, and olive oils and lower total mortality\n* Every 10-g/d increment in plant-based oils intake was associated with an 11% lower risk of cancer mortality and a 6% lower risk of CVD mortality\n* whereas a higher intake of butter was associated with higher cancer mortality\n* Substituting 10-g/d intake of total butter with an equivalent amount of total plant-based oils was associated with an estimated 17% reduction in total mortality and a 17% reduction in cancer mortality\u00a0\n\nSTUDY: [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831265](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831265)",
