Thank you so much.\n\nI have a slightly different perspective (and maybe controversial) on how I use this that might make you feel better even if these posts don't get *massive* engagement on the subreddit (**yet.**):\n\nAfter January, I pretty much swore off leveraging this subreddit and its content creator as the *focus* point of discussion, attempting to get peers, or more specifically, my mother, to use it as a resource similar to her using brian tyler cohen for obvious reasons. \n\nHowever, these breakdowns are **extremely valuable** in the way I can easily disseminate information in bite sized chunks which I'm flinging outside of this sphere of the internet without worrying about the question of 'who is dgg / destiny'. \n\nIt provides a fantastic, agnostic? approach to information that is a lot more value-packed than I'd be able to find elsehwere. Great job folks.",
