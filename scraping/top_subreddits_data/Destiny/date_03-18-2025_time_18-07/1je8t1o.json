            "body": "For those not from Canada, you need to understand that Canadian voters don't vote in parties, we vote them out.  Trudeaus popularity has been tanking for the last three years and a large number of voters had made it clear to their elected MPs that they wouldn't be supporting the liberal party if Trudeau was still the leader.\n\nThe conservatives growing popularity over the liberals in the last year was mainly because of a growing dislike for Trudeau.  With Trudeau gone, it was expected they would regain some support. The new liberal leadership has cut one of the major policies of the Trudeau liberals, the consumer Carbon tax, leading many to shift support back to the liberals.  Dislike for the Carbon tax and Trudeau had polled as one of the main reasons for the shift in support.\n\nTrumps actions have helped bump the numbers a bit but the writing was already on the wall when the conservatives couldn't shift its messaging away from a dislike for Trudeau to actual policy.\n\nThe Conservatives has spend the better part of the last 3 years focusing on being the party that hates Trudeau and insinuating that the county is beyond repair. Now with an external threat, and national pride and support at an all time high, with the population more unified then it has been in decades (maybe ever) the conservatives don't stand a change.  Not to mention that many conservative leaders in Canada have spent time in the last 3 years trying to be buddy buddy with Trump, his allies in the republican party, MAGA influencers, and Elon Musk, its the poison pill that pushed it over the edge.\n\nTLDR: Polling numbers have less to do with Trump, and more to do with the fact that Trudeau and the Carbon Tax are gone. Americans need to stop acting like they are responsible for everything that happens in the world....",

Canadians without a doubt vote governments out more so then they elect them in,  this is abundantly clear that change is actually quite rare with the average time a party stays in power is roughly 9 years, \n\nWe don\u2019t see close races and generally see a party hit rock bottom popularity before they get the boot.  The PCs in the 90s brought in the GST and it killed Mulroney, Chr\u00e9tien / Martin has a number of scandals that led to the party taking a hit over the minority period, but when Chr\u00e9tien stepped down and Martin took over it gave them a short lived bump, without that switch it was projected they would have lost. Harper was a dull lame duck at the end of his 9 years with voters supporting a young Trudeau over the old stuffy Harper they had grown tired off with a decade of war in Afghanistan.  Now we see the same thing with Trudeau gone, voters are showing greater support for a renewed liberal party.  The conservatives entire platform is seemingly \u201cwe aren\u2019t Justin Trudeau\u201d and that doesn\u2019t work anymore.  \n \nAnother factor that backs up what I\u2019m saying is the clear trend of different parties at the federal and provincial level.  You have provinces who have conservative governments but have predominantly liberal or NDP members of parliament at the federal level\n\nOntario for example has a conservative provincial government with an NDP opposition, but with a majority of liberals representing ridings at the federal level in Ontario.  This is repeatable in a number of provinces, and shows that people aren\u2019t just voting by party line, they are making choices and those choices often are the result of tiredness for a party in power.",

Less than 5% of the populations is affiliated with a political party, roughly 30% of voters have different federal and provincial voting habbits.  65% vote down party lines and are unaffiliated.  Of those 65% of voters, when you account for voting patterns over the last 20 years, roughly half of them will change voting habits and aren\u2019t partisans.\n\nThe CPC and the Liberal party are more similar in political ideology then the Liberals and the NDP. The Libs and the CPC are center left and center right parties, or at least the CPC is ran and controlled by center right conservatives and always has been for the last 20 years of its existence. this is why you see the biggest swings in support between those parties, and why you see many provinces holding conservative governments with NDP minorities",
