The team should feel like they work well as a unit but individually Spidey can mop them up if he isolates them.\n\nGoblin is his own Final Boss and a threat alone. I just don't think he fits. Goblin is something else.\n\nVenom and Carnage don't work at all. I can't see how the goals of the group would align with either of them. Carnage isn't group material. Venom would find the idea of 5 others sharing his defeat over Spider-Man utterly offensive. His whole hangup as a villain is he wants to prove he's better than Spidey. Venom's ego would be an issue. Neither of the symbiotes are crooks.\n\nKraven doesn't need to be in the group and doesn't really fit. Like Venom, I don't think he aligns with the goals of the group much, and a little like Venom, would likely see a 6 vs 1 victory over Spider-Man offensive to his pride and honour, and an unsporting victory. Sinister Six would be beneath him. He isn't a crook either. He isn't even that sinister.\n\nChameleon is like Kraven, an intelligent and cerebral villain who doesn't fit the 'gang' vibe of the 6. His style as an antagonist doesn't align with it.\n\nMysterio's perception and reality warping abilities is too different from the group's physicality and would likely cause more problems than help. His need to be in full control of the situation for his abilities to work would be likely undone by the group, nerfing his effectiveness as a trickster.\n\nOck, Rhino, Scorpion, Vulture, Sandman, Electro is the best lineup where the team up makes sense, their abilities compliment each other, they're varied but dont look odd together, and they would be extremely dangerous as a group, but vulnerable alone. They're a good, traditional group of non-genius, physically formidable asshole repeat offender criminal baddies who would have been locked up in the Raft and who Doc Ock can lead naturally in a revenge spree as his muscle. They don't care how they defeat Spider-Man, just that they defeat him. They fit the 'gang' bill the group needs. They're more likely to be the team players. These six would be a pretty cohesive 'superpowered crook' group.",
