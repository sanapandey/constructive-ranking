Covid happened, which ruined releases and the order of releases so films had to be cut certain ways to still make sense, and reshoots had to be done with a limited cast. Some films had new directors/screenwriters added who had loads of time to mess with scripts they didn\u2019t write and make changes. This last reason is partly why Multiverse of Madness turned out the way it did. They were also filming/releasing multiple projects at one time and writers/directors were meant to keep things cohesive but they couldn\u2019t see finished projects to the project they were working on because those previous project were still in development this was due to Bob Chapek forcing multiple projects on Marvel all at once splitting the studio between film and Disney + series due to MCU popularity. Again this happened to impact MoM. Raimi never saw Wanda Vision, and Elizabeth Olson was on set trying to guide Raimi through her characters previous development. There are other factors to like over working cgi artist and stuff, also as you mentioned the J Majors issues. A lot happened from 2020-2023 that majorly impacted the MCU.  \n\nA lot of this is why Marvel studios is now split again between two divisions, TV and Film, and Bob Iger is in change once again. Also why they only released DP and Wolverine in 2024. They needed to get their bearings back and flesh out the full plan for the remainder of phase 5 and 6 so things could get back to cohesiveness.",

Ms Marvel, Wiccan, Kate Bishop, all had enjoyable projects, and unfortunately two of those got ignored by a large part of the fandom because of \u2018woke\u2019, and to some extent, that makes Disney more hesitant to continue things. Too people just don\u2019t want to enjoy anything new, because they just compare everything to Endgame; I think that\u2019s what\u2019s making Disney a lot more cautious when they\u2019re making projects. \n\nAgatha All Along was a prime example. It had a tiny budget, but it managed to exceed Disney\u2019s expectations and become one of the stronger post-Endgame projects. If more people had given it a fair shot, rather than just dismissing it because of \u2018woke\u2019, maybe we\u2019d see Disney be a bit quicker when it comes to greenlighting sequels and expansions.",

Thunderbolts should have been the latest crossover, not the first.\n\nOne big issue, imo, was that there were too many characters with solo introductions. In Phase 1, Clint and Natasha were introduced in Thor and Iron Man 2, respectively. Out of all the people introduced post Endgame, I think Riri is the only person to not have her own solo introduction.\n\nThe MCU was also way too micromanaged. There should have been different creative teams working on the different \"Avengers\" teams. Because it was supposed to be one consecutive story, we ended up with so many characters not returning for way too long. Shang-Chi came out 4 years ago, and we haven't seen anything to do with him since, and that's about par for the course. Pre-Endgame every single character averaged about 2 years between appearances.",

Use the TV shows to introduce B-list and below characters, and tell their stories there, then use the movies to introduce them onto the teams. Like, we could have had a show telling a Hawkeye/Black Widow/Shield story during Phase 1, and that wouldn't have taken away from the movies at all if you didn't see the show.\n\nI've heard the initial plan for Quantumania was for Scott and Hope to get trapped in the Quantum Realm, then Cassie was gonna put together the Young Avengers to go save them. So, Kate and Kamala were both introduced in TV shows, and Cassie, America Chavez, and Riri were introduced in another character's movies. That's exactly how they should have put together the other teams, too. Instead, we got everyone else getting their own movie/ show and no team ups.",

He could have been the next Iron Man but he might as well be just some random low-level sorcerer at this point, since he's soooo weak and innefectual and he's not even the Sorc. Supreme anymore (was he, ever?), because having Alfred making cameos as Batman over Bruce himself in other projects (to use a crazy analogy) was apparently much more important than just building up Bruce Wayne himself...
