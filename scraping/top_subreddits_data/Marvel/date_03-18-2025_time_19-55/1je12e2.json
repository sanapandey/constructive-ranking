            "body": "Hickman really \\*got\\* that if there is a metastory for the Marvel Universe, it's the rivalry between Reed and Doom. And then, even more miraculously, he took over from Millar's wacky run that was just... not good regarding Doom (I seem to recall at one point Doom surviving from the Jurassic era to the present day through sheer strength of will? And desire for revenge against the Marquis of Death, Millar's OC DO NOT STEAL super Doom). And Millar came a little after Waid/Wieringo who did their level best to destroy Doom's character forever. \n\nAnd despite this, Hickman managed to, over a few years, put Reed and Doom in a position where they're somewhat comfortably on the same team and pursuing the same goals. Gives them a nice personal climax, Reed saves Doom's life, Doom thanks him (imagine Lee/Kirby Doom thanking Reed! For anything!), there is a d\u00e9tente in the air.\n\n*And then* Hickman takes over the Avengers, creates a sprawling, epic saga seemingly predicated on Steve and Tony, and subtly manages to bring it all back to Reed and Doom. And it works! The event itself was a little rushed and could use better pacing, but the last bit, with Doom and Reed's final confrontation, Doom admitting Reed was always better, and Reed healing Doom's face - chef's kiss. This page still gives me goosebumps. It's a distillation of the heroic ethos, the Fantastic Four and the Marvel universe all at once - a good and motivated person CAN enact change. It can get better. We can be better than our worst selves. We can forgive and grow. Family can heal. In the end, everything lives. \n\nVictor laughing, earnestly laughing with joy after losing ultimate power to his worst enemy because he realized there are more important things, because he is whole again, for the first time in decades, and because he understood that Reed was his friend all along, in a manner of speaking. Wow. Some of the best and most consistent character growth in Marvel, if not comics.\n\nHonestly it's *so good* that even though I was never a Doomstan before Hickman and saw him as a generic bad guy, my headcanon for Doom now always ends with him reformed in the long run, and him backsliding into villainy just does not make sense from a characterization point of view (as you might imagine, the recent story where he destroys a timeline because he was spiteful their version of Reed and Doom got along and outdid him, does not appeal to me much lmao).",

                            "body": "I love the run but it was clear Waid saw Doom as a completely irredeemable monster, and any nobility or honor or benevolence as just putting on airs. Doom is a lying liar and a spiteful, petty jerk, basically.\n\nIronically this was my first FF run, I read it as it was coming out, almost, and I loved it. I still do, Waid understood the four, and even the Doom story was incredibly gripping and engaging and just, a great read. But I think his Doom was reductive in ways that serve the story in the short term but damage the character in the long term. Think Hank slapping Janet - you get some juicy drama out of that at the expense of Hank\u2019s character being permanently damaged. You can\u2019t pretend he didn\u2019t and just have him be Joe Q. Avenger again. I am trying not to give spoilers but I recall an interview where Waid said that his motivation for That Story is making sure no one can write Doom as an anti-hero ever again.\n\nHe failed, because it seems most Marvel writers love writing Doom begrudgingly working with the heroes. This is part of why I disliked Cantwell\u2019s \u201cDoom destroys a universe because petty\u201d story - you KNOW that in under five years someone will come around and want to write a lighter shade of grey Doom, and editorial will okay it, and we all then will have to pretend Doom did not kill a universe last year.",

                                    "body": "I'm pretty much in the same boat, adore Waid's run except for his take on Doom because of the severe reduction of character nuance. I'm gonna copy my comment from another thread that I feel is better suited here.  \n\n> As someone who's read a lot of Doom comics recently, over more than 50 years of publication, I'd most definitely say it's a rare case of him being mischaracterized, and here's why I think so.\n\n> Doom is genuinely hard to write OOC because he's so versatile. He can be inciting a war or trying to save the world, he can be noble and honest or lying and deceptive, he can be played straight or have a certain humor to him, and all of it feels natural for him because he's just so multifaceted depending on which goals he's trying to achieve. His evilness, too, is never in question, but what makes him interesting to me personally is there are just a few lines that it doesn't feel like it would ever cross.\n\n> One of these lines, to me, is Doom not being able to physically harm the only few people close to him, namely: his old caretaker/advisor Boris, his first girlfriend Valeria, and his goddaughter he named after her. Notice how I even specify \"physically\" - he harmed their feelings and emotions plenty over their history together, but it still always felt like he would never go one step further than that.\n\n> And then, well, Waid's run happened.\n\n> Of course you could make an argument for showing how truly evil Doom is by making him commit a heinous act on a personal scale vs. blowing up a random building, and well, in that it's certainly effective. But I also think it was a wrong turn for the writing to take. Sure, you could argue that's not necessarily out of character, but I think it is because it makes him a worse character, by making him much more flat and reducing this complexity he has in those unique relationships. Giving villains people they care about (even if in their own twisted way) and are afraid to lose is much more compelling to me than sacrificing those relationships just to turn them from already evil to super omega evil.",
