It's just talked about like a rudimentary embarrassment.",

I agree they shouldn't be sexualized, but let's not pretend they're something they aren't or these kinds of stories won't connect with them. Runaways was such a breath of fresh air when I started reading it in high school, because to me they felt like actual kids.

Why would she think of threatening to strip a bunch of minors naked in front of each other as a form of punishment? There are a million other things she could threaten them to behave with.",
