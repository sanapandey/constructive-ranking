    "selftext": "I know this might get some people angry and not happy with me, but honestly, I think Thor looks way better with shorter hair than longer hair. \n\nLong hair Thor is cool and all, but short hair just suits him more in my opinion. I think with shorter hair, Thor looks more mature, put together, clean, stronger, sharper, and less reckless than in the earlier movies. I feel like the longer hair on him looks kind of off (like it doesn\u2019t fit the shape of his face and head). I also think that the short hair is more practical for someone in battle.\n\nI know in the original Norse mythology Thor has long hair and that how he is depicted in the comics, but I think the shorter hair on him looks better and I think Marvel should have kept the look moving forward. \n",
