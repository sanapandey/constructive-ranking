Having not seen either of these films in years I too thought they were the same actor. Neither of them could be mistaken for Denzel Washington or Will Smith or most other black actors, but they could easily be mistaken for each other, especially if you have a hazy memory of them like me. I also think that Elijah Wood and Daniel Radcliffe look alike, it's nothing to do with race.\n\nEdit. I know I was being a little pedantic, and this is not a hill to die on. But also, I seem to have been blocked from replying to other comments in this thread, including the one calling me a nazi for having this opinion.",
