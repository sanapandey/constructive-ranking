But behind the scenes, editorial nonsense mucked with the storyline so it\u2019s just kind of weird. \n\nVox is from death of the inhumans by Donny Cates. The kree come to the Inhumans to say join or die. Vox is their inhuman attack dog. design is based off of an Alex Ross design for earth X. The character has no relation to that it\u2019s just a fun reference.\n\nThe last one is from Straczynski run where he introduced Spider-Man being a spider totem and through a secondary magical adventure Spider-Man accidentally kind of set off magic alarm bells so she\u2019s a magical being that\u2019s hunting Spider-Man to eat him",

During the JMS run, she lured Peter to fight by pretending to be a scorned lover in public, to discredit him in front of everyone and some people bought that; cue an angry as hell Peter attacking in the middle of an interview where she transformed into that form.
