The trick is that he would do it in a way that serves Doom, and not necessarily with your interest at heart. \n\n\nLike someone else said about Thor he's more an I'll avenge your memory type rather than the type to focus exclusively on preventing you from dying in the 1st place. He is a walking saga and my death would probably make better prose for his tales. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Norrin is Radd. Much like the Wu-Tang Clan, the power cosmic ain't nothing to mess with. The chance to see what Kirby Dots look like in person and flying through space on his dope surfboard would be cool as hell. Sign me up for Silver Surfer Protection any day of the cosmic week.",

Now the Surfer is never created. \n\nBut the real point is that having Doom for an enemy is a losing proposition unless your name is Reed Richards.  Like Doom may not be the best protector, but he will definitely kill me in dozens of different ways.

I've been an X-Books guy since 1991. Recently I've been making my way through all of the X-Books and have made it from 1963 up to like 1985 or so and I'll say that watching the Master of Magnetism make the long transition from helmet twirling villain bent on world domination, to reluctant teacher and school administrator has been an absolute joy. \n\n\nThat said, Magneto's drive and power level are almost tidal in their ability to wax and wane. He is equally as likely to push himself to his own destruction to see something through to the end as he is to just wash his hands of the whole thing in frustration (maybe I'm still salty about him sending the New Mutants to the White Queen's school in Boston but I literally just read this issue so I'm allowed) and also equally likely to be so powerful he can shift the entire magnetosphere of the Earth just to inconvenience Charles's telepathy as he is to be distracted enough to let some humans with plastic guns get the drop on him. Lately Max has not been in the best of shape either way seeing as he's suffering from a mysterious bout of resurrection sickness (didn't know he was a WoW character too) that doesn't seem to be affecting the hundreds of other resurrected mutants...\n\n\nAs much as I love and respect Magneto, If the other three are fervently on my tail I simply cannot bet my life on which side of the bed Mags woke up on that day.",

If Doom believes he can do a thing and wants to see it done (especially out of spite) he'll get it done.which is actually another reason why I'm going with the Surfer. Norrin tends to be pretty stoic. I don't think he would give Doom the psychological fuel Doom would need to power his spite engine. I think Doom would eventually get bored or convince himself the task of offing me is beneath him and become distracted by his next plot to piss off Reed.",

                    "body": "So I do agree Magento could stand a good chance, but Magento and Moon Knight are not a comparison. Moon Knight could stop the hammer because he is connected to the god of the moon and Uru is technically metal from a moon, so he is tied to it. Magento should technically be able to since it is metal, and since its powers can control lightning, Magneto should be able to completely control Mjonir. But I don\u2019t think that would happen. He isn\u2019t able to just redirect the hammer itself, or drop it mid-air, but probably prevent it from manipulating electricity.\n\nBut yeah, Doom gets crushed easy, and Surfer is a challenge, but Magneto could take him",

But none of these guys are slouches, and it could always go another way. \n\nMagneto is tough as nails, but I've gotta believe this would be a pretty static defense play. He can create insane forcefields, and has ways of striking out against the others while within safety. But that said, you're pretty much a sitting duck and hoping that the other three powerhouses can't overwhelm your defenses, which can't stand forever. \n\nThor is tough as hammers? Lol. He's about the opposite, and while he could teleport you away, is going to pretty well abandon you in order to stay in the fight. His defensive options when not being agressive aren't great, and the other three are too much to handle without getting caught slippin up. The moment he strays too far and can't peel, you're toast. \n\nDoom. Tempting, but I'm not sure the machinations i want to be subject to in order to be 'saved' by Doom. His downfall is always his arrogance, and as much as he seems in theory that he should win, he finds a way to let it slip through his fingers from oversight. \n\nSilver Surfer. Likely the most versatile here. You could claim that Doom fits that category, but he doesn't have the raw stats to back up Silver Surfers play. Silver Surfer can play with time, heal you, grant you powers, create force fields, speed blitz the others, and more. Also, as a technicality, if there is any chance someone here is 'worthy' and could take the hammer from Thor (attacking an innocent) its him.",

Thor could send me to one of the 9 realms, but Doom is either sorcerer supreme or on similar level when it comes to magic, he can find a way there. Overall Doom is the scariest cause he doesn't even need to be there, he can send his army of Doom Bots or Latverian Mutants to deal with whoever is protecting you, then do some deal with a higher being to curse you out of existence. If he truly wants someone dead and doesn't care about \"besting\" them like with Reed, he has no qualms about destroying his enemies in the most diabolical ways possible, unlike the other three.",
