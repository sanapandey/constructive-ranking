I believe it\u2019s also the first time they fought since IMs little nightmare arc (he had a pretty rough nightmare about Magneto and the nature of his powers that had a whole issue dedicated). My headcannon is that he decided to buckle down and really prepare after that got to him.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Magneto was draining Stark and about to win this AvX fight before he felt the Phoenix force destroy a planet and stopped fighting.

When he gets hit by a rocket or gets whacked by an alien, you still see inside the suit and Tony has cuts and bruses on his face and body. \n\nIs it still reaslitic? Of course not. But it's called Sci-Fi for a reason. It's all well crafted bullshit that deals with imaginative and futuristics concepts of technology and advanced science.\n\nThat's why I called it Hard Sci-Fi. It's not the Star-Trek level, where everything is trying to be as realistic as possible, but still be in space. At the end, it's still superheroics and you can't just think about \"But it has to be real\".\n\nI also like how I was talking about a sci-fi character, and you bring in \"In real life\". Learn to stay on track when you are having a converstion. I didn't even once say that \"Well, in real life he will work\". You are just being a titty.\n\nAnd I do know what verisimilitude\u00a0means. Like I said, having an advanced technology that can do all that crazy shit is far more \"realistic\" or \"believable\", than \"I was just born this way\".\n\nAt the end, both of them are not realistic and fictional and it's all up to a writer. Hawkeye can hand Hulk his ass if a writer chooses to do so, and you can \"realistically\" write that scenario.",

What the fuck do you think 'realistic' means? Why do you think I specifically used the word 'verisimilitude' and not 'realistic' to describe my stance?\n\nYou clearly just use words however you like, without regard to what they actually mean. When you bring in 'more realistic', you're clearly doing so as a comparison to reality. *That's what that means*.\n\nYeah, and if Hawkeye beat Hulk like that, anyone with narrative sense would call that shitty writing. That's the entire point, you numbskull.\n\nYou have a problem with the very premise of comic books and speculative fiction.",
