I particularly enjoyed the quieter second half (damn, that sunset coloring was superb), but I feel like Duggan rushed here the Blue Bolt / Firestar pairing, especially after having Watt turn her down last issue. I really appreciated Tony's leader role here, embracing Angelica and giving Blue Bolt some positive reinforcement.",

Now rocking the Flag Smasher motif! How will Rogers destroy the department of education in the 616 from prison? Let's hope he doesn't end up at one of those Roxxon private prisons!\n\nAh hmm interesting reveal that Blue Bolt is a 616 version of a MC2 villian, taking on the heroic montif once again showing how this lineup of WCA is really just the Thunderbolts. Let's hope this is really Blue Bolt's true identity and we don't find out he's a Space Phantom pretending to be Blue Bolt later!\n\nWonder Man gag pretty flawless. \n\nAre the Avengers going to bring up Mark Twelve I wonder? Does seem kinda sus Stark would align with an aspect of the current Ultron when there's a older version of Ultron already an avenger and with Whirlwind's powers to boot.",

He gets Tony.\n\nThe writing for everyone in this is amazing. Rhodey is just a bro. Ultron is really fun (and got a cool new design). Jessica is always a gem. Angelica is in the rough place, but I like it. She needs to take time and heal from Krakoa. Blue Bolt is officially my favorite new additional to Marvel lmao. Dude is a fucking dick, but so entertaning.\n\nBTW, Duggan is really good at writing comedy. The whole second part of the book with Tony, Jess and Rhodey having reaction to Blue Bolt and Firestar was fucking hilarious lmao. \n\nI literally went from \"Heh, that's funny\" to \"LMAO\" to literally pausing my reading and laughing pretty hard. Good job Duggan.\n\nArt is really good too. It's very cartoony and it works for this book.\n\nBadass moments and funny moments aside, the serious momets in this book were just as good. Angelica's \"I'm an alcoholic and I need help\" moment with Tony just hugging her before letting her finish the sentence was just\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a. Wholesome Tony is best.\n\nSeriously Marvel, can we have more books where Tony just helps other people with their addiction please? Buseik did it back in his 1998 excellent heroes Reborn run with Tony helping Carol and now we are getting Tony helping Firestar? Fuck yeah.\n\nBlue Bolt begging Tony to change his name, only to them name himself \"Wonder Man\" was fucking peak lmao. Cannot wait for Simon to get into the fight with him.\n\nThe book feels like Duggan just wanted to do his comfort nostalgia book lmao, and I'm here for it (he has said in the past that He loved reading Iron Man and WCA as a kid, and that his favorite suit is Silver Centurion so that tracks).\n\nI also love how we are getting two different Tony's in these two books lol. Main book, he is a lot more angry and hardcore. In this WCA series, he is more like a Supportive dad lmao.\n\nAnyway, this really good week for an Iron Man fan.",

This is his main job (outside of his solo).\n\nAvengers only get called together when there is a world threatning event happening, which doesn't happen as much as just some random assholes trying to rob a bank.",

She literally done it all.\n\nAnd I also caught that topical talk about Russia as well...yep.",

                    "body": "Alright, okay. This is going somewhere pretty interesting. I am weary of Tony dipping his toes in moral grayness again, but I think Ackerman has laid enough characterization groundwork in the previous issues to give him the benefit of the doubt. Plus, moral grayness is part of Tony's DNA for better or worse, and it's not like he was particularly compelled by Hunyadi. That being said, I do like the way Tony's desperation reinforces the stakes of One World Under Doom and vice versa by throwing in the \"extreme circumstances, extreme measures\" factor on the table. This run is also meant to play with stealth and public image, and Ackerman has promised a lot of \"this moment will take a different meaning a few issues down the line.\"\n\nI can only hope that whatever Tony plans in his book will actually work and won't step on his allies' toes. But Ackerman has mentioned that he has gone over his contributions for One World Under Doom with Ryan North, so here's hoping whatever Tony is doing here will have an important role in the wider event. On a side note, I'm enjoying Natasha's appearance. I love it when writers remember she's a part of Iron Man's mythos. Also happy with the Winter Guard, and I'm glad that both parties will have a recurring prominent role in this story arc based on future solicits.\n\nAnother thing I'm hoping is for next issue to break down the upgrades that Tony made to the Improvised Armor. You'd think the new torso looking so overtly Iron Monger-y would have warranted at least an acknowledgment in Tony's inner monologue, so I really want to get more deets on what did Tony do to his armor.\n\nOn the art department, I think Julius Ohta's return to the book is very welcome. There's just something about the way his art complements Ackerman's writing that really elevates the book's identity. I like that. Fingers crossed he isn't pulled out of the book to work somewhere else like it happened to Juan Frigeri and CAFU before him.",

Quentin pulling a 'dirty trick' to beat Xavier in a mental battle with quite the interesting way to portray the conflict. Though using Cassandra like that, considering how she is behind the adult mutants going haywire with their powers, was a fitting low-blow I guess. \n\nKwannon and Storm had a moment too, where she forced Storm to take back her body. Though this crossover still caused trouble for Storm's own book as it disrupted that book's pace as we still don't know how Storm is dealing with or aware of Eternity inside her. Suffice to say though, it was quite the weak reason for Storm to have a fight with Scott's team. Adds to my distaste of the ongoing XvX stuff.",

And of course they only know ONE THING to do with him. Archangel. Talk about creative bankruptcy.\n\nHonestly, the ONLY positive this book has is the immortal granny. Everything else is just bad.\n\nAnd now, we have the 'last' resurrection egg and Xavier gets kidnapped by someone random now. What are the odds as they talking about hope, that it will be Hope getting resurrected?\n\nAnd the Xavier plot is really a mess jumping from book to book, Xavier's motivation does not stay consistent. Like he literally broke out because his daughter was in danger. Then he started going around gathering stuff that had little to do with that. And now he talks about how he brought them there to show them the final egg. What is it?! What is the main goal? They show that his mind is going bad, causing others to suffer from his 'telepathic leak'. I honestly don't see the end point for all this leading to anything satisfying.",

Like you said, the plots are being reused, her costume sucks and it\u2019s landing like a shallow power fantasy. It feels like she\u2019s just a super Silver Surfer instead of a god among gods. The dialogue about how she\u2019s creation and balance and the guardian comes across very super-heroey in a way that doesn\u2019t feel right for someone who is supposed to be a cosmic entity.\n\nTo top it off, the caption at the end of the issue describes this as her \u201dmost powerful form ever\u201d. I guess that\u2019s the final nail in the coffin for my cope that this is some ugly state in between turning into White Phoenix of the Crown. Hopefully future Marvel writers ignore/retcon everything after Phoenix destroyed Enigma.\n\nI think a more interesting Phoenix run would be a limited series which explores the aspect of her being beyond time/space after accepting Phoenix, showing her actually play a hand in some of the pivotal events in Marvel past and future. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d moments like casually intervening in things that seemed like a big deal at the time. Something very non-linear. This could include the \u201cBeyonder/Phoenix war\u201d teased in the Defenders story about the cosmic hierarchy. Really big omniversal events, strange and mysterious, leaving the reader with more questions than answers. Jean observes her role in maintaining the cosmic balance and finally accepts that she has to dissolve her ego as the final step in the Phoenix\u2019s maturation. She ascends into White Phoenix of the Crown and basically disappears as a character for a while. Her ego of \u201cJean Grey\u201d is deposited back on earth, and will occasionally be a vessel for some of the major cosmic balancing stories hinted at in the limited series, but is otherwise just Jean from then on. Let the cosmic entity part of her be as mysterious as it should be, off behind the scenes maintaining balance. I don\u2019t really want an ongoing story about the ultimate curb-stomper, as I\u2019m one of those who believes Phoenix is second only to The One Above All.",

It seems this whole run, or maybe the entire ASM series could be dead at this point, until we get something like the current Ultimate Spider-Man. But honestly given the way things have been going, as long as Ultimate Spider-Man can stick around, I honestly wouldn't mind 616 Peter going the original Ultimate route, so Miles could be the official 616 Spider-Man. Miles' current run has been pretty good, but it feels like he's in this awkward place where he doesn't really matter as long as 616 Peter is still around. It's ironically funny that they're doing this \"Deaths\" arc right now with the new ASM creative team, yet it won't end with him actually dying, and if it does, we already know he's coming back.",

The mini depression arc really killed the momentum for 8 Deaths, it will probably read better in trade as you can zoom past it rather than wait nearly 3 months for that to resolve.\n\nI do believe the downvotes are unwarranted, the story is not nearly that bad and people need to stop doing that out of some misguided belief that it's gonna fix the book.",
