My grandpa was 100% Irish and not a very tall man, but he was always a charmer and a great conversationalist. \n\n\nAnother small note was he was a mailman whose route was in a black neighborhood. He always passed up \u201csafer\u201d routes and did that job for 40 years. I took him to a funeral when one of his friends from that neighborhood passed and we were the only white people there. And my grandpa was right at home even though he didn\u2019t know a single person there besides the deceased. \n\nMan. I miss my grandpa",
