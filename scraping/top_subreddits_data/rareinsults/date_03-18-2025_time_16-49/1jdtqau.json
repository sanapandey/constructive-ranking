Vapes only become widely available in the US in 2007 and so we still don't have really solid data and studies on what a lifetime of vaping does to a person. The tobacco industry plays on this lack of long term studies to make it seem like vaping isn't bad for you and by the time we finally get them there will just be another product that still needs studies.",

They want to keep the inflated premiums on consumables and not give customers ideas (hence also that weird vapes they make with the tobacco sticks). It\u2018s a self-created problem really. Because they\u2018ve bred high nicotine yield tobacco plants, for several reasons. Burning plant matter is a really shitty nicotine extraction method, you get about 10% of what\u2018s in it, the rest gets burned to tar. But yields in these plants is higher than what you\u2018d smoke, they use high/low yield variant mixes to adjust nicotine content, at a guess I\u2018d say it\u2018s about twice of what\u2018s regulatory allowed. So 1g high yield nicotine tobacco contains about 20x as much nicotine as you\u2018d smoke. There\u2019s a whole pack of nicotine in one cigarette. Supercritical CO2 solvent extraction is about 95% efficient. So\u2026",
