Man, that kind of money would've changed my life back then... but then so would've Rhodesia.\n\nI was back to living with my parents. I told my dad about. He said, \"you're going to be all alone, and those guys won't break you in, you'll be stuck with the shitty positions, out front, point, flanks. You know what us guys talk ( bunch of Marines in the family), but you're not exmilitary, you're an asthmatic, and you may not come back. I don't think you should, but it's your decision.\"\n\nGuy came in the bar two weeks later, told me that I'd be expected to be in Alabama in two weeks, three weeks training, one week to settle affairs. I said no thanks... spent two more years in that hole, looking for a lousy job. Still think I made the right decision.",
