A nose job is an outpatient procedure that has an easy and fast recovery.

The amount of times I've been told I must just suck as a person and that's why I don't get dates is unfortunate. I have a ton of friends, and am very sociable in my social circles, but maybe they're right, maybe I do just suck, hence why I am just waiting to off myself once my mom passes.

Very easily so. There is a difference between saying there is an objective standard of beauty all people must conform to and saying there is subjective beauty that makes you as an individual happy.\n\nWhen I say everyone is beautiful, I don't mean people should never change. That is just as ridiculous as claiming they must change. What I mean is any change is entirely optional and should be done because it makes you as an individual happy, not because society says so.\n\nlet's use a different example to illustrate my point better. Tatoos are still seen in a bad light. They are more acceptable nowdays, but society still sees them as \"trashy\". But if you want a tatoo, go for it. Screw society, do what makes you happy. And if you want to remove your tatoos, that's fine too, you shouldn't keep something you no longer like in your skin just because removing it is \"conforming to societal standards of beauty\".",

I believe performing unnecessary and/or cosmetic medical procedures is unethical, due to the inherent risk associated with any medical procedure. \n\nThe responsibility is on the doctors, of course. All doctors take the Hippocratic oath, and an essential part of that oath is to do no unnecessary or excessive harm. Due to the risk of harm associated with any medical procedures, I believe any unnecessary or cosmetic procedures are in violation of the Hippocratic oath, unethical and that no doctor should perform such procedures. Therefore, they should be illegal.\n\nThis is the same reason I am firmly against circumcision, for instance.",
