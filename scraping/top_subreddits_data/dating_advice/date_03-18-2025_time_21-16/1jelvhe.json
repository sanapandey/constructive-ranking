    "selftext": "I was in an on-and-off situationship, met him in 2022, but in 2023 I slept with him, but that was because I was young, dumb, and in love. Which couple of days later he was dry and ghosted me. We started talking again in 2024, but when we hung out the next day, he just started being dry. A couple of months later, he told me he realized I was the one he wanted to be with. It just hard for him to be in a relationship because \u201cit doesn't feel right\u201d Well, I lost interest. I'm no longer in love with him because 2 weeks ago he wanted to hang out the next day to the point I woke up early and got ready just for him to not text me the whole day till night. Well, I want to send him a goodbye text. A goodbye text telling him I'm done because if he wanted me, he would've made it happen, but in reality he doesn't care about me. My question is, should I send him a goodbye text that I'm done and moving on with my life? Feel free to go off on me to not send that text and just move on with my life. Maybe it's just my heart feeling sad and want to send that text. I have him blocked but I'm willing to unblock him and send that text. ",

You can walk away feeling good about yourself instead of having to console yourself.\n\nGhosting demotes closure and promotes coldness. It is extremely antisocial behavior  called for in situations where you are in danger and have to escape, and that's not your situation here. \n\nWhat goes around comes around. Model the behavior you'd want if the roles were reversed. Do it for you, not for him.",
