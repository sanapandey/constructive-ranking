    "selftext": "A few days ago, I (29M) was approached on the train going into a big city and the train was packed and noisy with drunk people. \n\nA few minutes before everyone got off, a beautiful woman asks me for my Snapchat (I don't have one) and then says she thinks I am cute. No one has ever approached me like this. I didn't really know how to react because she was really drunk and I felt uncomfortable about pushing.\n\nTbh, I have only ever been on one real date in my entire life and it went nowhere. I have tried dating apps but I barely get likes (none on Hinge) and no dates have ever come from it.\n\nSo I am wondering if I am a fucking idiot for not getting her number or if I did the right thing. This has kind of been haunting me the last few days.",

Specially as a guy, this doesn't happen often. At least for the majority of men. Most guys prolly get never approached in their lives.\n\nAnd, this also shows you, that women do notice you, sometimes even attractive women. But, online on dating apps, that is a bad hunting ground. You will not have much or any success there.\n\nYou gotta do it in RL.",

I\u2019ve had a couple of drinks. I think you should have gotten her number. It\u2019s too late now but seize the next opportunity. \nObviously if you did meet her, you should get to know her sober. But having sex with a drunk woman is very frowned upon. It\u2019s predatory and disrespectful. That\u2019s sometimes even considered rape even with consent depending of how drunk she was. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand how a 29 year old only had one date. Respectfully, I think you are low effort. Women like men who put an effort to get to know them. I personally love to be old school and let the guys approach as lazy guys waiting for women to approach them, don\u2019t appreciate them afterwards. \nMen in general only appreciate things/ women they worked to get. Like you guys have a need to feel you earned it. \nYou are a male, act like one and take courage to approach women when you see someone you are into. As long as you are polite and kind, usually women will be flattered even if she\u2019s not interested. \nOr not, just stay forever single waiting for ur dream woman to find you.",

Like, \"4 out of 6 ended with her cheating\" bad and 6 out of 6 were with me because I could provide them with money (i.e.what I can buy her), shelter, or transportation.  I gave up even looking for the last 10 years, and then after sitting down at my 2nd DnD game in this one store (after giving DnD up for 21 years) in walks literally my perfect woman.  We are about to celebrate our 6-month anniversary (I know, but I'm smitten) and things are great.\n\nJust let it happen.  Don't worry, worry doesn't help with women.  Instead find a hobby you like and focus on that.  If you find an attractive woman doing that hobby, you already have ONE thing in common.\n\nFor what it's worth, that's my 2 digital cents.",
