How do you go about letting her know or telling her without it being weird or creepy?\n\nEdit: Bit of context, we lost contact for a long time due to my phone number getting changed and moving away, however we spotted eachother in public and reconnected. Theres no romantic connection but we\u2019re both horny and very curious",

Hey, I find you really attractive and was wondering if those feelings are mutual? \n\nIf she responds omg no, or ew no, no way or even just a nah I\u2019m good. Just back off and be like oh my bad I misread the situation, I thought there was something but there isn\u2019t and that\u2019s cool. Then change the subject to something obviously a context change. Like how about that weather huh? And laugh it off and prepare to be ghosted.\n\nCreepy comes from reading too much into a situation, and acting weird and over the top or disrespectful of boundaries. Not for having regular human hormones and feelings and asking if those are shared.\n\nYou become a creep when you make her feel weird or uncomfortable about saying no. I\u2019ve had more casual flings off of jokes and casual banter than actual dates of we\u2019re being honest.\n\nOn the other side of that I\u2019ve ended up ghosted for suggesting it. \n\nI\u2019m also still friends with many of the people I had fwb situations with. So creepy is how you approach the situation, how you handle rejection or acceptance. It\u2019s not just innately creepy to let someone know in a respectful way you find them attractive.\n\nGood: Hey this thing has been on my mind a bit, I think you\u2019re really attractive and was wondering if the feeling is mutual?\n\nHer: No I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not interested.\n\nYou: oh ok cool, I misread the situation hopefully I didn\u2019t make you feel uncomfortable. How about that weather eh??\n\nBad: You\u2019re so hot I want to bring you back to my place and bang your brains out, the things I would do to you.\n\nHer: ew fucking gross what?\n\nTreat females like humans (because they are) and you\u2019ll have a lot more luck.",
