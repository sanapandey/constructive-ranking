Most trashy, disrespectful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced in a while. It\u2019s not so much that she didn\u2019t want to meet, it\u2019s that I blocked off time from my busy schedule & she didn\u2019t even have the decency to text me to cancel. Oh and the kicker she hasn\u2019t unmatched me from Hinge \ud83d\ude2d some girls need to grow the fuck up and act their age. I expected more from a  professional 32 year old",

We would all be a lot happier and be able to find life partners if people just put a little more thought and intention into themselves and their actions. No one owes us anything, we owe it to ourselves to become desirable to the partners we want to attract. Everyone seems to want a partner to just fall into their lap but it really only takes a few changes or actions for most people to meet a potential partner. Dont overcomplicate it, you have the key to your own happiness.",
