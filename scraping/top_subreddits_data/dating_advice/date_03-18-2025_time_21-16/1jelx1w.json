            "body": "Do you feel when a moment arises that you could kiss you are over thinking ? And stressing out? Or do you not ever have almost moments and are just thinking about it and stressed?\n\nEither way. Time will bring comfort. Emotions. Love. Experience. Maturity. Age. Confidence. All of it will change as time goes on.\n\nSex. Kissing. It's natural to a degree. Maybe it's awkward at first but u will grow into it. Good bad. It doesn't matter. Try not to worry about what the other person will think. Ure young u don't need to be an expert. Ur in new relationships. U don't know each other's bodies yet. It's normal to be nervous. \n\nMan. I hated sex and kissing and dating because it made me so anxious. I would think about it outside of events related to it feeling shit and I would feel like I was bad or think too much while it was happening and it just ruined it for me. It's ok to be bad. It's ok for it to be awkward. It's ok to not like it with someone. Fuck. It's ok to stress abkut it even. \n\nMy advice is just do it. Stop when u really don't like it. Start again. Stop. It's like anything. U don't have to be good at something to try it or enjoy it. If u wanna make art but u only know stick figures who cares. Just do it. \n\nWhen I was young (and I'm not even old only 29) I was so nervous about everything. So upset. I guess I'm still like thay but I also learned and decided not to care. Stay anxious. Lean into it. Get confident. Whatever. Either way just don't hate on yourself for feeling something. It'd gunna be ok. It's gunna be awkward. But one day you will find the shoe that fits. Or maybe it won't fit but it will be your shoe and you will love it",

Not sure how you expect someone else to please you when you don't even know what you like. You can try books like \"Becoming Cliterate\" or \"Come As You Are\"",

The more you stress about it, the less comfortable you will be. \n\nOver time, try initiating physical contact more often. The more you do it, the more comfortable you will be with physical touch. Keep in mind that's just physical touch, separate from sex.",
