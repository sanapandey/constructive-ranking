    "selftext": "I\u2019m a 26-year-old guy who\u2019s spent the last few years laser-focused on self-improvement\u2014everything from fitness and style to social skills and seriously optimizing my online dating profiles. And, crazy enough, it actually worked: my Tinder right swipe match rate has shot up to about 15-20% (based on the stats I tracked), which is far above the 0.6% average that is quoted for most men.\n\nBut here\u2019s the confusing part: even with all these new matches, I still feel like I\u2019m slamming into the same roadblocks. I end up having to carry *every* conversation, and when I ask them out on a date, a majority of them say they\u2019re already busy, or ask to reschedule only to be busy again, or find other excuses. It\u2019s honestly very exhausting\u2014juggling a bunch of chats that never go anywhere feels like a soul-draining full time job.\n\nI always figured once I started getting more matches, things would automatically be easier. Clearly, I was wrong and I'm kind of surprised to be honest. Is this just how online dating goes now, or am I missing some big piece of the puzzle? Has anyone else been through this? Any tips on how to actually transition from higher match rates to real-life dates would be amazing. Because at this point, I\u2019m starting to wonder if the entire system is broken or if I just need a different approach.\n",

The last guy I went out with wanted to have a phone call with me before we dated, we played Mario kart three different days before our date and that made me feel really comfortable. Maybe most women are like me and need a bit of reassurance that the date won\u2019t flop before going on it. Who knows though.",

One message that's dry - ok maybe she was busy and/or I didn't give her a lot to work with. Two strikes you're out, it's not getting better.

That's about the best you can do.",
