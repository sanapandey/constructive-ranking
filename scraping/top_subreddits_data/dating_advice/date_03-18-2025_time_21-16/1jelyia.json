Like huge red flag???\nFor real though who the fuck says I love you after one fucking date?! \n I get that I'm like awesome and amazing and everything and I totally understand how someone could literally fall in love with me watching me eat food....but like who in their fucking right mind says I love you after the first date...   \nIf anyone has any advice or recommendations I would really appreciate it.\nWhat do I do... \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c",
