    "selftext": "I (27F) ) had my first ever one night stand a few months ago at a low point in my life (didn't realize at the time it was going to be a one night stand though, I thought he actually liked me) and after we had sex I felt uncomfortable down there for a while but just thought it was because he was bigger and it had been a while since I had sex.\n\nThe guy started breadcrumbing and being hot and cold after and I kind of freaked out and had my second ever one night stand when I thought the first guy had officially ghosted me. I wasn't safe either time which I know is such poor judgement but I really was just not thinking clearly either time.\n\nWell I freaked out and decided to get tested and was positive for chlamydia which was devastating as this is also a first for me. I immediately told the second guy and he told me he came back negative (still waiting on proof).\n\nSo now I know it was the first guy but l'm hesitant to tell him because I really liked him and I've been not so secretly hoping he would come back eventually. We still follow each other on Instagram and I just don't want to be associated with an std in his mind or for him to try to twist it and believe I gave it to him. I technically have no proof I was clean before him since i was in a monogamous long distance relationship for five years I didn\u2019t get tested. I guess there's also a (very) slim chance I had it for years without knowing and what if his test also comes back negative? Then I just look like a gross liar.\n\nI feel guilty because I know I should inform him and he's probably infecting others as we speak. I thought about an anonymous text but I'm terrified he'll associate it with me and without an explanation is even worse. Also I kind of want to have him understand the importance of telling his partners because it can cause infertility and I feel like a lot of guys don't think that way. He's clearly not the most mature or thoughtful guy and I don't want that on my conscience.\n\nYes I know I shouldn't care what he thinks but I do and I feel like him knowing he gave me an std would be so embarrassing and prolong my inability to move on. I'm so conflicted.",

That's what would be on my conscience, in this situation.\n\nYou can't stop him from spinning it around and trying to say you gave it to him, but you can absolutely say that you were out of a long-term relationship, with no indicators of the infection or any reason to suspect something was amiss. At the end of the day, if he doesn't want to accept responsibility, that's his prerogative. And who knows, maybe he'll know exactly where he caught it from.\n\nTalk to him, do the treatment, and move on... from both.",

I went through a period of having one night stands and I think I contracted it a while before getting tested. At the time that I got tested, I was seeing someone who I really liked. When I got the positive test results back, I felt like my world was destroyed. I was super emotional and started crying instantly when I got the call. It seems so dramatic looking back now, but it really is so seriously devastating when you're in it. So I get you. Anyway, I was supposed to go see the guy who I thought gave it to me (the one I really liked) and basically broke things off with him because I was so embarrassed. I told him to get tested and he ended up being negative. I think it must have been this military guy I had been with months ago because that was the only other person I had been with recently. In hindsight, the guy I liked was really really nice about it, understood me, and didn't shame me. I regret breaking things off with him everyday still, even a year later. All of this to say, I think you should definitely tell him. It could have only been him. I've never regretted my choice to tell my guy because it is objectively the right thing. My advice is not to say it accusatorily. Be understanding and keep it short. I hope you feel better because I know it's a mental thing as well as a physical one. If you need support, lean on those close to you. It's not as shameful as you think right now.",

These include:\n\n1. Scarring and Damage to Reproductive Organs \u2013 Even after antibiotics clear the infection, any prior damage to the fallopian tubes or uterus (due to inflammation or scarring) cannot be reversed. This can still lead to infertility or an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\n2. Chronic Pelvic Pain \u2013 Some women develop long-term pelvic pain, likely due to scarring from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This discomfort can persist for years even after the infection is gone.\n\n\n3. Increased Risk of Future Infections \u2013 Having had chlamydia once does not provide immunity. Women who have had it are at a higher risk of getting it again, especially if their partners are not treated. Repeat infections can worsen reproductive damage.\n\n\n4. Altered Cervical and Vaginal Health \u2013 Some women experience changes in vaginal flora after treatment, leading to increased susceptibility to conditions like bacterial vaginosis (BV) or yeast infections.\n\n\n5. Possible Impact on Pregnancy \u2013 Even after successful treatment, past damage to the reproductive system may still contribute to difficulties in conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term, including a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, or complications in delivery.\n\n\n6. Psychological Effects \u2013 A history of an STI can cause anxiety, stress, or emotional distress, particularly if it has led to infertility or relationship concerns.\"\n\n*I'd recommend that you see a gynaecologist.*",
