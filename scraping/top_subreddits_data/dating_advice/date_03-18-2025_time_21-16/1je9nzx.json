We spent a lot of time together during that phase and while it is technically not cheating, it still felt like betrayal. It had a lot of consequences which eventually led to us cutting it off. I\u2019m curious about the other perspective because it is hard for me to understand the why. Let\u2019s have an open and respectfull conversation and share insights!",

I was sick of guys not wanting to commit or using me, so I stopped investing fully in one person until they decided to do so. It helped me stay emotionally unattached, which protected me from moving too fast or getting hurt.\u00a0\n\nHowever, it did backfire once or twice and cost me a relationship with someone I really liked.\u00a0\n\nIn my 30s, I found that being vulnerable and only dating one person at a time worked better for me. I learned to keep my emotions in check and take things slower without dating other people (having a busy career, hobbies, friends, and a child definitely made this easier). I still had a few disappointments, but it didn\u2019t hurt as much. It felt safer and more respectful to myself and the people I was involved with.\u00a0\n\nIn short, everyone is entitled to their own methods and boundaries in dating. Now that I\u2019m older, I feel like people who multidate in the early days of dating are just immature and probably insecure or scared of getting hurt, like I was. Maybe some people do it because they like to keep their options open or play the field, but not everyone is doing it for that reason.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s still okay to end it if that makes you uncomfortable, which is how I did things in my 30s even though I was once on the other side of things. Just try to remember that it doesn\u2019t always reflect on someone\u2019s character or ability to be faithful in a monogamous relationship.\u00a0",

He wasn't ready for a monogamous relationship yet, but he did like me. But we were also in the dating stage, so although he knew me for a few years, he didn't know me know me. He didn't know what he wanted himself. And he only knew how it went with his ex relationships. \n\nIt was when he was ready to be exclusive that he started to realize what he wanted. And then, after dating exclusively for a while, we got into a relationship. We have always communicated really well about everything. And now we have a great relationship where I trust him 100%, and he trusts me.

I don't have any particular desire for the details, in the same way that I don't need specific details about my partner's sexual exploits with people before we met. \n\nIt's sad when you're sort of interested in someone and they decide they want to end things when you don't, regardless of the reason, but that's totally fair. I would wish them well. I don't think it's cheating, but I also completely understand that opinions on this cover a wide spectrum; some people would see it as a betrayal, even before you've agreed to be exclusive, and other people would not. Nothing wrong with either position, though I think it's valuable to be clear and up front with people if your expectation is exclusivity even before you're *officially* exclusive.",

What's there to be guilty of?\n\nI get this could sound callous, but multi dating, for me, is a protective measure borne from experience.\n\nI've dated people who, after weeks of \"great\" dates, have totally blindsided me - ghosted, cut things off, then immediately go official with someone else, or the ex that was allegedly out of the picture, etc. I should have initiated those exclusivity conversations earlier. Worst case scenario, at least I wouldn't have been caught off guard. But I didn't, I got burned, and I'll take the fault there, no question.\n\nSo, if she expected exclusivity, she could and should have initiated that conversation when she was ready. Just as I could and would have done, when I was ready. I can't read minds.\n\nIf I feel something, I say something. Evidently, she did not share that approach to communication. Therefore, we were not compatible. Communication is a major part of a relationship - if it wasn't this, it would've been something else.\n\nEveryone's entitled to their outlook on this issue. Personally, idk why you'd assume you're cuffed up immediately to the person you just scheduled a first date with (or whatever arbitrary milestone you think is the objective exclusivity threshold).",
