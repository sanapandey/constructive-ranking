    "selftext": "I've slept with exactly 15 women in my life, and it probably would've been more if I had a car and a job during the first 13. The reason I was such a lowlife was because I only cared about getting drunk, smoking weed, and sleeping with women - I was able to do that so I had no motivation for discipline. As I got older and began maturing, I became more spiritual, got myself together, got a car, a good job and my own apartment. I did a lot of work myself, read a lot of self-help books, and am now looking for a serious relationship. But now something just seems to be completely off, like something in my brain is not be clicking. I overthink everything now, I worry about being disrespectful, and because of that, I've been struggling to meet women I actually like. What is going on? ",

The moment I got my act together, that pool dried up for a bit. \n\nIt\u2019s quality over quantity and I believe the aura you give off to the world is what you attract. In my party days, I attracted a lot of party women which is a lot of women in their early 20\u2019s. But when you\u2019re about business and have things going for you, you attract more put together women, which believe it or not are a lot less than you think. This was my experience at least",

            "body": "Age and the stage people are at in life may play a part. \n\nWhen people are young adults around the age of college students, it's just easier to find sexual situations. Thats just the culture. Many young adults that age want to party or even just loose their virginity. Alot of guys have guy friends and they bet on how many women they can get. Even many women are more interested in only persuing sex. \n\nOne of the reasons is because of their uncertainty about their future. It's difficult to think about pursuing a long term relationship with your highshool or even college sweetheart when you arent sure if you are gonna move out of state for college, or work, or to go to the military. You might not be sure if you want to study abroad. It's hard to think about marrying your longterm partner when you are broke and trying to figure out what career you want to pursue. The majority of young people experience that kind of uncertainty on how they can make a LTR work. \n\nCollege is a temporary situation, trying to get a car and a job is a temporary situation, that whole stage of life is a temporary situation, therefore the majority of people's dating/sexual experiences are temporay situations at that stage in life.\n\nTypically, when adults get a bit older and more established as an adult, they decide they don't want any more temporary situations because they have more clarity on what it is they want in their life. The h*e life gets old after a while and they then become open to sharing their life with a deeper more permanent person.",

I wasnt unkind before but i just didnt care to go out of my way.\n\nPeople went out of their way to help me when i moved and started a new life, so i think that changes it a lot but suddenly same i didnt know how to make friends in my new city and i was so anxious and scared. \n\nYoure brain is probably just geared towards a more long term outlook so youre anxious about lasting consequences which is normal! But be confident, im sure you still got game! \nIts almost like you gotta just get out and test your new social brain and you'll get used to it! Its actually quite enjoyable to see ourselves interact and socialize the way we want to! \n\nHave fun, relax some, its okay if not EVERYONE llloves tou because the reality is some people are made to NOT get along with you, that's how personalities work and thats what i say to myself.
