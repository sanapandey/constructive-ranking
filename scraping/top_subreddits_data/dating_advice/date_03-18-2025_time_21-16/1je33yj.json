I think not ever being easily listened to has contributed greatly to some of my \"need for control\" anxieties. I think it also contributes to why I don't like being helped with things and would rather do it myself even when part of me does want help.",

I would also like to mention this is the first time I\u2019ve experienced this feeling of being heard in this way. \n\nThere is a common thing that happens in partnerships where one will take on the burden of doing tasks simply because the other refuses to do it the way their partner likes. (For example, wife will fold clothes because the husband does it incorrectly). This ends up adding more work to the partner when it shouldn\u2019t really be their responsibility to teach these things. \n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s unfortunate that we let people get away with doing this for so long instead of holding them accountable. Usually this is something that may be a reflection of childhood or a ven early relationship experience. If you care about someone, it should be natural to want to do things to ease their burdens and provide them some peace of mind. At least that\u2019s my opinion.\n\nEdit: This concept is discussed in the book Fair Play by Eve Rodsky",

I think what I was trying to get at was more realizing why it can be difficult to feel grateful and having to fight my own need for control, and possibly where that need for control even comes from. It connected the dots between anxiety and control a bit for me. Like I imagine that if I felt heard and understood that it would be easier to let others do things their own way or discuss the different ways to do it, but instead it always feels like the only options are: fight to have it done exactly this way, let go and let it be done however it gets done (and express appropriate gratitude even if it isn't felt), or do it oneself.",

They want the disney experience but not to see the cables and scaffolding holding the whole thing together. My ex-husband used to get mad at me for not calling or texting him while I was at work, it made him feel unloved, un-thought of, and unimportant. So I set alarms in my phone to send a text or call throughout the day, otherwise I would hyperfocus on getting through work. He loved that I had finally changed, until he saw my alarm go off and found out how I had changed. Rather than being proud of me for using tools to build a new habit, he was upset that I didn't just magically do what he wanted on my own, because to him that meant I still wasn't thinking of him all the time. The truth is I did think of him as much as he wanted, I just didn't have a habit of reaching out like he expected, and I would usually think of him at moments where my hands were too busy to use my phone. I would forget or have other things to do when my hands were free enough. The alarm simply meant that I had to get to a stopping point and address the issue. But that wasn't romantic enough for him.",

Ok, so I few days ago, someone posted a question (and I'm paraphrasing her): \"Do you prefer a guy with no experience or a guy with a lot of experience.\" The women overwhelmingly chose the type B, the guy with a lot of experience. One woman even says she has no time to \"teach\" a man (some comments were funny, lol)... I think your preference is very **rare!** By the way, she was the woman with no experience and the guy with experience broke her heart which is why she asked that question in the first place. But my question is why dp you like the lesser desired guy?",

Dating apps, specifically those that make money off of paid boosts or subscriptions, are designed to keep people on the app, and because of todays political and social climate, I know it just isn\u2019t very realistic to meet someone in public and talk to strangers. There are women out there looking for someone like you, and they\u2019re just as frustrated and feeling defeated with the system that\u2019s grown into a monster over the past fifteen years. My recommendation is, if you have to use a dating app, use Facebook Dating. Last I checked, there isn\u2019t any monetary incentive to keep you on the service and it was more of a pet project than a big focal point for Meta. I met my husband there. A lot of men I know are having better luck there than Tinder or Bumble or Hinge, but it isn\u2019t perfect. My other suggestion is to get yourself out there in a community like a church or a club or volunteer. Go to trivia nights or karaoke - places where you can make connections not only with women but other men. The confidence boost will show and help!! There\u2019s someone out there for you, and despite the odds, you will find them. The world has just put up more barriers and challenges to meeting people, but you\u2019ve conquered 100% of the challenges you\u2019ve faced in your life - You\u2019re still here, and you got this bro!",

I hope you are finding healing.\n\nIt's a fake story. They are just farming pity points, so don't feel that bad.\n\nIf they actually had internal decap they claimed, they would be dead literally instantly. Those who do manage to survive it, die a little bit afterwards. Those who survive and stabilize are bound to bed and certainly aren't in position to shitpost like you do on reddit anymore.\n\nForget thinking about dating, they would not even be able to coherently type.\n\nAccording to their other comments they only found out she died day ago, but in other comment they say she died in hospital 4 rooms away from them. At the same time, they say it paralyzed them for a week or so, in past sense, as if they recovered. \n\nIf that story was true, they would be medical miracle studied by researchers right now. And if it wasn't medical miracle, they would not be in position to have all the concerns they are posting about all around reddit.\n\nI don't think there are cases of full recovery in history, ever. Recovery with non life threatening complications is literal best case scenario. No one in such position would be thinking or talking about dating.\n\nAlso, they can't even get their age straight in the stories. They are 29yo in one message, then 31 in second message literally 1 minute apart.\n\nThey are unreliable narrator, so nothing they say holds any weight.",

Girls feel free to chime in.\n\n\\- Being a problem solver - We went on a trip together early on in our relationship. It was hectic. We went to 5 europeon cities in 14 days. Alot of problems came up such as delayed flights, not realizing we had to setup a taxi service before landing in venice, etc. What impressed her was that everytime an issue came up, I either solved it or tried to figure it out on my own. I never put the responsiblity on her to figure it out. She grew up having to do everything for her siblings and even today most people in her life expect her to problem solve so when she saw that she was really impressed.\n\n\\- Remembering things - Our first christmas we had like a 100 dollar budget. For months she would randomly say things that she wanted to buy but never got. So I bought a number of things that got to 100 dollars from the list that I saved. She was shocked, there were things there she didnt even remember telling me about. \n\n\\- Putting effort in things she cares about - our first valentines day she was dropping hints about asking to be her valentine. I didnt think she cared because she is someone who doesnt really care about things like that but she had dropped a hint every couple days for a month. I pretended to be lazy about it and then one day she had to go into work on a saturday. She was living with her sister so I quickly made her a card with a picture of us and a small and quick poem off the top of my head. It was short but silly basically saying how cool I think she is and how dumb I think it is that I had to write this. We were going through our first big fight of our relationship and when I saw her next she had puffy eyes and told me that she cried when she saw it because no guy has ever been that considerate to her or put that much effort. \n\n\\- Dont wait for her to ask to do something - this im still working on. My GF loves to clean. I clean, but I dont feel the need to do it everyday. Ill leave dishes in the sink for a few days until it gets too much and do it in one go. There are times where she starts to clean randomly and Ill offer to help and she says that she wants me to chill as she is finding it relaxing. Big mistake because then during fights, im the one that never cleans or helps out in the house. So now, I try to do something everyday even if it's small. If she picks up a broom, im picking up the vacuum regardless of what she says. I still need to work on this though.",

Sticking up for women's equality in front of your peers and colleagues and family is an act of courage and courage is always sexy and also an act of loyalty and loyalty is also very sexy. Equally sexy? Men who take responsibility and apologize without qualifying it--super sexy-- And even better, ask her to help you come up with ways to prevent a hurtful situation in the future. Finally, I'd say be vulnerable, expand your vocabulary, read more, and offer to take her on fun outdoor adventures sometimes.
