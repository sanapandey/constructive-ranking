    "selftext": "Yes you read that correctly- I am a 21 year old female who has never had a boyfriend before; let alone hold a guy\u2019s hand. I go to the gym and lift weights (very big gymrat), know five languages, study a respectable field, and have great friends. So what\u2019s the problem? Am I supposed to be making a move on a man? (I believe in being chased after, not being the chaser- old fashioned I know but that\u2019s the way I am). Or are men just scared? I am tired of hearing the \u201cit\u2019ll happen when you least expect it\u201d because at this rate, it will never happen. I\u2019m starting to get insecure because I think guys think I am ugly. ",

Men are also oblivious to hints, and even when we notice them, we are scared of misinterpreting them. If you want a guy to approach you, you have to make it obvious that you want HIM to approach specifically. Or just start the conversation first and introduce yourself. Men are very receptive to new conversations unless we\u2019re deep in a task or have headphones on.",
