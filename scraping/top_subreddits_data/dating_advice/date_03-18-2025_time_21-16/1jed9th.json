    "selftext": "Why should men always be the ones to text first? In a world that champions equality, the idea that men must initiate every conversation feels outdated. If two people are interested in each other, why should the burden of starting a conversation fall solely on one side? A relationship\u2014whether it\u2019s friendship, dating, or something deeper\u2014should be built on mutual effort. When only men are expected to make the first move, it creates an imbalance where their interest is constantly tested, while the other person can remain passive. A simple text from both sides shows equal enthusiasm and removes the pressure of one-sided effort. So, isn\u2019t it time we move past this old-fashioned rule and embrace communication as a two-way street?",

So naturally it is up to the man to pursue not women. We have to be picked.\n\nGenerally speaking - I see that women pursue/chase men they end up getting used for sex. If a man wants to take you serious he will pursue. If a woman has to chase/text first you are more interested than he is and he will end up using or treating you bad.",

Shown by the fact that they rape at much higher numbers (to get sex), and pay for prostitutes way more often than women (willing to part money). And are willing to risk rejection by hitting on women. Some men literally risk jail time just for sex.\n\nWomen rarely rape, pay for a gigolo, or make the first move. Clearly, they don't want it as much as men. If they did want it more - they would make the first move just as often as men, or more. But they don't. They usually just wait. They might say they want it more - but I don't see it in their behavior. Actions speaks louder than words.\n\nIf you look at dating apps - its like 70% men. If women wanted it just as much as men - the distribution on dating apps would be 50/50. But its not. Because women don't want it as badly so many don't go out and dont go on dating apps. They're okay just living their life and having fun with the girls. \"If it happens it happens\".",

I do understand there is a line that needs to be drawn like blowing people's phones up and all but just sending a nice good morning/ afternoon text? Also the other side of social stigma is that if a guy texts a girl often it's considered harassment or is seen as annoying and that's probably why guys do not initiate anymore because of these things.

Because there are so many men who are shy or have confidence issues, and just because they're not initiating conversations doesn't mean they're not interested. I have a very extroverted friend who pursued her husband. He actually had a big crush on her early on, but because he was so shy, he was afraid of getting shot down and didn't pursue her. Once they actually were in a relationship, it was more mutual, but she was basically the one chasing him at the beginning. And now they both say they're glad she did because if she had left it all up to him like people advise women to do, they never would have gotten together.\n\nHonestly, I think whatever gender you are, if you want to text the person, just text them. If they're the right person for you, they're not going to be turned off by you texting them when you feel like texting them.",

To put it simply, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have to, and because it\u2019s been the norm.\n\nWomen all around the world apply for jobs or colleges or talk to strangers. They face rejections too for those jobs (probably more than men do). It\u2019s because they NEED the jobs. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here. If you were a conventionally attractive man and this whole thing was swapped, would you pluck up your courage and express your interest at the risk of rejection when multiple good looking women ask for your numbers everyday on the streets and hundreds of bombshells are on Tinder sending you thirsty messages everyday?\n\nMen and women aren\u2019t that different. Many issues \u201cshould\u201d be fixed and we should strive to be better but the root cause is often very biological. Men - violence, SA, war and etc. We should fix it sure.
