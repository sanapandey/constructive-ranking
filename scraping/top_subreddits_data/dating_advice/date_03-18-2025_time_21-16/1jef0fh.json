    "selftext": "I am a 30 year old woman and i have been single for so many years i don't want to even admit. I feel like garbage because even though i know i am good looking, social and i have interests, every time i try to just get to know a guy, they never get past the initial flirting stage. For some reason they all love to breadcrumb and lead me on without ever wanting to even go on a date. \n\nI have done so much work internally to fix whatever the problem might have been from my side. I have matured, grown as a person since my first relationship which was over a decade ago. I learned not to chase, to be patient, to try and approach men directly, to not care and let them approach me themselves, to leave it alone, to try... but nothing works. They always drop hints and do the silly little gestures that indicate attraction and then they stop. The people that know me all agree that i must have terrible luck. They literally say that there is nothing wrong with me. But it doesn't make sense.\n\nI spent my whole 20s alone. I haven't been touched or even properly flirted for years. I am exhausted and lonely and it impacts every other aspect of my life. I feel so unwanted and unworthy after all these attempts. I feel like men don't even want sex anymore, that they just like to feel wanted for reassurance. I hate generalizing and i try not to pinpoint this specifically towards men. I know women do that too, but from my experience at least most women have cut that stupid behavior out by their mid 20s. On the other hand, i have met even 37 year old men who are so immature and just want an ego boost.\n\nThe dating pool has been getting smaller and smaller every year for me. I am now in my 30s already and i rarely even meet people my age who are single, let alone people who i will feel attracted to. And when i do, the ones who seem to reciprocate at first just change their minds without an explanation. \n\nI am afraid i have wasted the best years of my life, my years of prime, because i am getting older and i will not be as pretty as i have been. I fear i will just be a disappointed lonely and bitter woman. I cannot trust people anymore. Every time i try to open myself to dating again, the same things happen and i get even more distant and closed off. \n\nAnd then i read about \"male loneliness epidemic\" and stuff like that and i get so mad because all the women i know have always wanted to be in stable relationships while the men i have dated or flirted with never seem to know what the hell they want. \n\nI am done trying to understand what is going on with this world. I am hurting so much just trying to get some physical intimacy, let alone a deeper connection. I have given up completely.\n\nI apologize for the long post but i am in such distress and i needed to get this off my chest. I hope at least someone out there understands how hard it is. ",

            "body": "I'm a 40-year-old man and I've had the same run of luck. I've told all my friends about it. Over and over and over and over again; they flirt and flake. Not every time, but enough that it's become a pattern.\n\nPart of it is online dating. But I honestly feel like part of it is mindset. I'm an eternal optimist and that really pulls me through what might otherwise be dark times. I keep working on and improving myself and doing things I legitimately enjoy that probably make me more attractive and interesting. I've been working out consistently for about 5 years, and my body is impressive enough now that some women will outright mention it or flirt with me over it. I've been learning Spanish for about the same amount of time and have reached a solid intermediate level. I just started learning to dance Tango.\n\nRelatedly, I think it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'm trying to date a woman I know from real life now and she's shown extremely high levels of interest, including telling several mutual acquaintances that she likes me. But we've been talking for about 3 weeks and I haven't been able to get her on a date. One time it was a legitimate scheduling issue; the second I'm not so sure. My inclination was to just scratch this off as a part of the pattern and do something stupid like get upset with her. But then I realized I'm kind of jumping the gun. It might still work out, and if not, there are other women out there. So I'm continuing to try to date other women. I have a date tomorrow night. \n\nEventually someone is going to be crazy about me and what I offer and I'm going to be beating them off with a stick. And I might even like them too lol. I just strongly believe this to be true. Even if it's not, I choose to live in hope and happiness rather than cynical pessimism.",

It\u2019s because you have a healthy and positive mindset and that in itself is very attractive! Last man I would date is a very bitter one. You seem like a net positive to have around in life!

That's the self-fulfilling prophecy and I know I've done it. The only solution I've found is to keep myself busy and fulfilled with my hobbies, and try to keep meeting/dating other people so I don't obsess over a single one.",

                            "body": "Sure, but that's just part of it. We were actually coworkers (she quit before I asked her out). One coworker told me she had the hots for me. Another said she would talk about my body and how sexy she thought I was, and that she would smile ear-to-ear whenever my name came up. She was also overheard wondering if I had a girlfriend, saying that I \"probably do.\"\n\nSince I asked her out she has been fairly flirtatious in our messages. She has also brought up future date ideas at least twice. She's interested in coming to one of my Tango classes, and one night she wanted to go but couldn't because of prior obligations and I said, \"I'll get you in my arms one of these days\" with a winking emoji, and she said, \"In two weeks I'll be able to make that happen\" with the sly smirking emoji. She often messages me good morning messages and so forth.\n\nI mean these are all clear signs of interest, right? But she just started a new job and a new schedule with her daughter with whom she has shared custody. This has given us some pretty tough scheduling conflicts. But in the last week or so she's just been messaging less and after our last scheduled date didn't work out, she hasn't suggested an alternative (other than the tango class suggestion, but that wasn't a firm plan). I haven't been doing anything to turn her off that I can think of. \n\nShe's also currently on a three-day trip that she planned many weeks ago, and I'm sure that's kept her extremely busy along with the recent changes. Maybe there's another guy. (I have no evidence of this, but I think this is a common reason someone fades out.)\n\nI don't know, but this is the type of confusing situation I've been dealing with repeatedly over the last year or so.",

I have met great women but I have felt zero physical attraction to, and I've met not so great women I was very attracted to, and in the end when you're looking for a partner, you need a balance of both.\n\nI have only seriously begun dating in my 30s (I was an absolute wreck in my 20s), and it's much the same. I've improved and work on all of my flaws, and am still working on being the best me I can be. Yet putting yourself out there, you often feel like no matter how good you try to be, it's never good enough for someone else to date. Either it's constant chatter on dating apps that's done out of boredom and validation, or you just swipe swipe and wait until you can go out and meet people who aren't doing the bare minimum.",

The constant idea that \"there's always better out there\", and it kind of sucks to be honest. Yeah it might be good that it is pushing people to be better, but for all the wrong reasons. Another factor, coming from personal experience, is a lot of guys are kind of tired and sick of dating. A lot of guys gotten rejected, burned, heartbroken, etc so many times. Women are also getting their emotions toyed with, led around, and all sorts of things as well. It makes meeting a genuine person a hard task and almost seeming impossible in today's society. Im not gonna lie, no one is coming off dateable to me due to past experiences and Im sure I am not alone on feeling that way. I look at relationships as a mental health risk and the idea of giving someone that vulnerability is not a great feeling right now. Maybe in time the dating scene will change, but I will admit it is very hard right now for everyone. Everyone is over it.",

But the same happens to me as a man. There\u2019s soooo many factors that play into why people do this though. But I do think it\u2019s more prevalent in the current dating generation due to social media. People can get attention and validation for free whenever they need it via social media, especially if they\u2019re attractive. Makes people think they have \u201coptions\u201d all the time and it\u2019s been so normalized to be ok to date multiple people at once. There\u2019s just not much dedication and effort anymore, which coincidentally makes the ones that do, question what the point of putting that effort in even is anymore?",

I also publicly advertise that I am single and looking for the one. \n\nI unfortunately do not have luck finding one\u2026 but I end up having good friends and they give me courages :) .

Yes, it\u2019s the beginning and we\u2019re just getting to know each other. \n\nIf you don\u2019t show me you\u2019re more interested than Sally that was willing to put more of herself out there, I\u2019m gonna write you off as another woman that I\u2019ll have to spend too significant of an amount of time and potentially money just to get to know. If our chemistry isn\u2019t naturally great off the bat, most times I would pass on making the time to get to know you. \n\nNot saying this is what\u2019s happening with you, my point is similar to what men are experiencing, the competition nowadays is even more fierce even for women. \n\nAs a whole, we have a ridiculous amount of options available to us at any given time. This makes people pass on people as if they are just an item at a store. \n\nThis attract don\u2019t chase mentality means well but it seems misguided to me. It\u2019s ok to put effort into pulling in a person you\u2019re interested. Relationships are naturally a constant push and pull, don\u2019t be afraid to give a little chase as you see fit. \n\nOtherwise, men will continue overlooking your potential for a good partner for the women that make them feel more desired than you may.\n\nDating is hard, but it\u2019s not impossible. Things changed for me when I started trying more and stopped caring about some arbitrary rules that differs from individual to individual",

You, nor I, really know what they're thinking. Only they do. Body language is a hint sure, but reading body language in general is a difficult skill unless you're naturally skilled at it. \n\nThat's why \"the game\" is so hard for men (not saying it's not for women, but just talking about the gender that approaches more). You have to be super, super, aware of the little tells of whether a girl is interested or not. Even then, a girl you're flirting with might be doing 10/10 of what you typically see girls do when they're interested, but that might just be how she is personally, and boom, she rejects you. \n\nThat's why generally, men who know a little but not a lot about body language, flirting, go with the direct approach. \"Hey you're really cute I wanted to say hi\" because it's clear and direct. There's no room for misinterpretation and it puts the onus on the other person instead of both of you \"hinting\".",

I\u2019m in my 40s now and looking back at my 20s that attitude added to the problems of dating back then. \n\nI think dating use to feel very different for men and women back then and now it seems like it feels the same for both. It sucks to think people aren\u2019t interested in you. That\u2019s what most guys felt when I was growing up. I think the solution is the same for women than it is for guys, don\u2019t worry about the nos, keep being proactive and don\u2019t wait for other people to make things happen. \n\nI think the dynamics changed a lot and attitudes are still adjusting. But there was a reason for the changes, even if it came with some sacrifices. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s great to be chased but we can\u2019t expect it to always be like that.

Because if you start dating someone at 35 you realistically wouldn't have kids until 37 or 38 at the earliest. \n\nYou may not like dating apps but I would not refrain from using them if I were you",

I'm saying that the level of assholishness that enables that behaviour is usually confused by confidence. A \"go-getter\" attitude, or so delusions go. \n\nYou're also wrong about it not being something only a fuckboy does. Doing that is literally what makes them a fuckboy.\n\nIf the men you know are leading women on, they're fuckboys. If they're stringing you along for hookups, they're fuckboys. If they're lying to fuck you, they're fuckboys. It's just that attractive men have a much easier time doing that and getting away with it.",

Most of them are also very average looking if not below, so it's not their looks either. It seems to be more of a validation thing, if you ask me.\n\nA fuck-boy is a guy that has a lot of casual sex, implying that he actually gets sex. Majority of the guys I see stringing women along don't actually get a lot of sex, hence why they have to string you along to keep the sex or any other intimacy in their life coming because without you they would be dry for who knows how long. The guys that I know that get women don't need to string you along, because there are many other interested women. They're more likely to let you go instead of wasting your and their time, believe it or not, so while a fuck boy can string you along I rarely ever see it because they just don't need to.",

A common mistake women make is they are only interested in the men who aren't. I don't know if this describes you or not. But dating is ultimately about finding all the people who are interested in you and then choosing the best match amongst them. It doesn't tend to work the other way around - choosing who you are interested in and then hoping they feel the same way.",

They lie a lot about who they are or what their values are and at the 2-3 month mark I find out and leave\n\n2. Exactly what you described OP where they flirt then flake and say, I only wanted to be friends from the beginning. But WHY? I have asked these men if they can just be upfront about it - do they just not like me enough, or they found someone else etc? Anything would be better than the gaslighting *I didn't mean anything by anything I said/did.* I have come to accept it's like you said, just a cry for attention and once they've had their fill they drop you.",

That being said, I do feel you need to at least think bout where you are meeting men and who are the type of men you are attracting. While you can\u2019t eliminate all the undesirable, unethical or bad character men, you can start by at learning how to improve to vet men properly for their values, character and motives. Dating is like fishing, if you are fishing in sewer water, you are significantly lowering your chances of finding quality fish as opposed to fishing in a beautiful ocean. \n\nThe harsh reality is that if it happens repeatedly that you continue to attract the same type of shady man, then it starts to become a reflection of your actions and decision making, which means you may need to adjust how you go about it. Understand that at least women can get to the front door, there are lots of men at same level who can\u2019t even make it to front door partly bc women constantly choose the wrong man repeatedly but never learn to try a different guy instead. \n\nTo answer your question, men \u201clead women on\u201d bc it\u2019s easier being a cold selfish fish w the fake it til you make it attitude than it is to be an authentic centered man with a healthy self esteem who creates his own happiness and success. No one will ever disrespect you if you don\u2019t invite them to do so. The easiest way to make those men disappear from your life is help yourself first. You got this.",

Let's be frank. It matters. \n\nAll in all: I dont think you are being honest with yourself. You are probably not as good as you think, yet. They probably lose interest, because...well you arent interesting, yet.\n\nThe good thing is, you can improve and learn. Suggestions:\n\n- Learn how to actually flirt. Eye contact, smiling, how to keep a good and flirty conversation, etc. (Plenty of contrnt on youtube available)\n- Do sports, and eat healthy. Get fit, it will not only improve your health and physique, but will also be a major confidence boost. Which is damn fucking sexy.\n- Find new hobbies\n- Become a fun, positive and interesting vibe, not the \"i worked on myself blah blah\"-boring stuck-up bs. Nobody ever \"worked on themselves\" enough to be good and have no mental problems. All of our shit is with us for our life, you can learn to handle it but not fix it...imo. also, reading your post gave me the impression you are a boring person. \n- Try giving a chance to the guys who you wouldnt normally approach\n- go backpacking and/or solo traveling, gather some new perspectives on life, cultures and stories to share about you.",
