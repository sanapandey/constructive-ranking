    "selftext": "So I\u2019m a girl and I used to dream of high risk high reward dating and attraction scenarios like just being bold and playing around and flirting but now men are super reserved bc they fear being creepy (understandable) so it\u2019s time for us to initiate. We as girls are hard pressed to come off creepy or actually scare a man since he will almost always have a physical advantage so now i feel strongly it\u2019s time for women to make the first move and be way more forward and flirtatious. Otherwise this dating stale mate will just continue. Also do you wanna select your partner or do u wanna be selected? Bc I wanna select. Just start small get used to a little rejection and in the end u will have way more experiences with men who you have strong interest in, not just the ones who approach u.",

He said he was caught off guard and appreciated it and leaned in for a real kiss that lasted all night. We just talked all night and weirdly only kissed for hours. Now we are dating. So if a girl gives you a baby kiss then she wants the man to take charge from there because sometimes we can\u2019t tell if the guy is interested",

It makes dating so much easier.\n\nEdit: People keep asking so just for clarification -- in the least conceited way possible, yes, I am conventionally attractive. YMMV if you have a different aesthetic.\n\nAlso ladies, if you really like the guy, try paying for the date(s) or buying him flowers. You have to kinda be pushy about it because so many women fake-try-to-pay as a test. In my opinion, you can't really call yourself a feminist and *only* fight the gender roles that disadvantage women, gotta fight the ones that disadvantage men too. The goal of feminism is equality. Besides, every time I've paid for the date, gotten flowers, etc. the guy has told me no one's ever done something like that for them before and it means a lot :) Between approaching first, doing things like that, giving massages... yeah, I'd say putting in the effort makes dating very easy :)",

They almost never take any kind of initiative or offer any kind of clear communication. I genuinely saw a girl post \"I make eye contact when I'm talking to him, laugh at his jokes, and I sit up straight when he's around, so why hasn't he noticed that I like him?\" \n\nLadies: ask a guy out. The good men aren't asking you while you passively wait for him to notice your posture BECAUSE they're the good ones who respect your time and space.",

That is coming straight out of my ex\u2019s friend\u2019s mouth and my ex\u2019s mouth. He was very nice in the beginning. I wasted 2 years with him. He lived with me, I supported him when he started his business and had no income (which he lost because he got fired for sleeping with a hooker and getting kicked out of a business trip..losing the company 50k), I cooked for him, I stood by his side during good and bad times, I was close with his mother and mother and law and his siblings and dad. They all thought I was perfect for him and a good example. I was by his side when he relapsed on drugs but established a boundary by making him move out, I tried to get him help, I let him borrow my car, I cleaned. He told me that I have the best heart. That I\u2019m the only girl in this generation that is genuine, not materialistic, willing to stay when times get tough, nurturing, intelligent and can cook. He said he\u2019d never fumble me. Turns out he was cheating on me with hookers on his business trips. He threatened his employees if they told me that he would fire them. I finally had enough with his ups and downs. I told him I needed a break and that same day my intuition told me to ask his former employer the truth. I confronted him nicely over the phone about his infidelity and that we will never get back together or be friends. That he\u2019s not a bad person but a horrible person. I asked for him to tell me in person like a man instead of me having to hear it from 3rd parties. He replied, \u201cyou\u2019re a liability to my lawsuit.\u201d Then he blocked me and acted as if I never existed. Sooo, was he a bad guy? Not in the beginning. You can\u2019t blame the women all the time",

Little chat at the bar, did not 'hit' on the girl at all, that's not really me, I'm not the smooth talking, chat you up at the bar kinda dude.

Next time she passed to go to the smoking area, I just said, \"Excuse me, can I give you this?\" Passed her a note saying, \"Don't want to interrupt your night or anything, but if you wanted to, and were open to it, do you want to get a coffee sometime?\" and left my name and number at the bottom. That way, she doesn't have to awkwardly reject me, and I dont have to be awkwardly rejected or make her feel cornered. Nothing has come of it like, unfortunately, but that could be for a million reasons \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nYeah, and it's so obvious, too. You should be with someone because they make you *feel more* complete, not make you *look* complete, or be a statement to *wear*. That's a one-sided relationship, isn't about the meeting of hearts and minds, and is gross. \n\nAww, thank you \ud83d\ude0a it feels soooo awesome when it's like that! Definitely! I totally agree! It's a key part of knowing if you're compatible. Thats not to say they can't be moved or shifted (within reason) for the right person.

I told him respectfully I don\u2019t want to go out to dinner, I wanted to stay in my pajamas, eat chocolate and watch all the final destinations but if he\u2019s willing to just come chill and talk then come over but I\u2019m not leaving the couch.

Hasn\u2019t worked out well so far, but I\u2019ll keep trying. \n\nThe Seattle men I\u2019m interested in tend to not approach me. I\u2019m a very sweet person, easy to talk to and get along with, fun, and honestly every guy friend, ex, and even some guys that didn\u2019t work out or are just fwb has said I\u2019m a catch. But I think Seattle men are intimidated by me and don\u2019t approach and unfortunately, I think it has to do with me being a black woman on the slightly thicker side (if you didn\u2019t know, there aren\u2019t many of us here and Seattle is pretty white). It does not matter how much I smile and laugh and make myself look approachable. In bars and stuff, I have plenty of convos with people who are not necessarily interested and people approach me every now and then but it hasn\u2019t been the ones that I\u2019m interested in. I may need to also just go to different types of places.\n\nI get toooons of attention online tho. So it\u2019s not that I think Seattle men don\u2019t like black women bc they definitely do, just like any other race. I just think they may not be sure if I\u2019m open to dating non-black people and to avoid rejection, don\u2019t approach at all. They are much more comfortable sending likes than they are saying something in person (which I guess is most people in general but I notice it especially so in Seattle and I\u2019ve lived and dated elsewhere too). Online, my likes and matches are flooded and I often send the first message. And no, it\u2019s usually not a boring \u201chey, how are you\u201d. Most times they respond, sometimes they don\u2019t. I\u2019ve been on lots of dates, meet ups, etc, but they don\u2019t pan out like I\u2019d hope.\n\nMy problem has been men fumbling me lol they pretty consistently have gotten spooked of their feelings and backed off. It\u2019s been hard to find men looking for the same things as me and even when they start off saying they are, they backtrack when things start getting a little more serious. Which I guess is good for me as I\u2019ve dodged some perhaps emotionally immature men but it\u2019s still a bummer every time getting led on. I tell my guy friends about the dates I\u2019ve been on, the conversations I\u2019ve had, things guys have said to me, let them read text messages, and they\u2019re all like \u201cI truly don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with these guys but it\u2019s not you\u201d. So I\u2019ve generally slowed down on trying to date to some degree, but I\u2019m still trying I guess. \n\nIk this was long as hell but I just needed to put it out there lol haven\u2019t talked to anyone about my dating life in a while",
