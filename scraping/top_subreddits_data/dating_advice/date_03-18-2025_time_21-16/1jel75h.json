I think I said something too cringe and I don\u2019t know how to recover. \n\nThe actual texts went like this\nMe: \u201cI like a little danger\u201d\n\nShe: \u201cis that why you like me ;)\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyah you\u2019re like a Pandora\u2019s box I feel like you\u2019re hiding a lot of lore\u201d \n\nShe: \u201c\ud83d\ude43\u201d",
