Working on myself self esteem, my anxieties, and understanding more about how I work and what makes me happy and attaining that on my own.",

Who will identify things that need doing and do them if I am unable to. \n\nExample, if I pick the kids up from school, take them straight to dance lessons for an hour after school, it would be nice to come back to a dinner already/almost cooked. I would wash everything up after dinner whilst she gets the kids ready for bed. We'd both sit down after that and spend family time reading the kids bedtime stories together, then unwind after the kids are asleep watching netflix together under the blanket laughing at eachothers shit jokes and genuinely listening to how eachothers day has been.\n\nI am after a friend who is a team player with everything.\n\nIf I don't see the potential of that happening long term down the road and sticking, then the relationship isn't going anywhere.",

Are they reliable and can they rely on me to help them? Can we counter balance our \"weaknesses\" so we both feel supported? For example, if I notice they have a hard time communicating issues, I can let them know that we will dedicate a time where we can check in with each other to vent and grow. If I am feeling anxious about something while my brain is feeling clouded with no direction, they step in to comfort me and start brainstorming ideas about tackling the issue that is making feel unsure.\n\nHaving your partner act as a team player in your relationship will help take care of those pesky everyday life tasks in order for both to have the goal of coming together at the end of the day to enjoy each other. Thanks for posting your comment, it serves as a reminder for what I want in a partner as well.",

You two exist in your own world, isolated in the best way. You spend hours lost in deep conversations-philosophy, psychology, the nature of existence, the darker sides of human nature. He challenges you, sharpens your mind, and in turn, you do the same for him. You're not just lovers; you're the only real intellectual match either of you has ever had. \n\nYou'd debate theories of reality, solipsism, quantum consciousness-what if our souls were always meant to find each other, lifetime after lifetime? He'd be fascinated by your mind, the way you challenge him, the way you make him think.\n\nYou'd throw out bizarre hypotheticals just to see how he reacts.\n\"What if we were the last two people on Earth?\"\n\"Then the world would finally be perfect.\"\n\"What if I had an evil twin?\"\n\"I'd know it wasn't you. I know you too well.\"\n\"What if we met in another life?\"\n\"We always would.\"\n\nAnd the best part? He wouldn't want to look at anyone else. His world begins and ends with you. His loyalty is absolute, unwavering. You're his wife, his reason, the only one who matters. The outside world is a passing blur-people exist, but they're irrelevant. He doesn't need them. He only needs you. But it's mutual. You don't just love him-you crave him. You want to see his devotion, his vulnerability, that rare moment where the cold, calculating man lets himself need you in a way that terrifies even him. And when he finally gives in, when he whispers in that low, unreadable tone, \u201cI wouldn't know what to do without you,\" you know you've won. Because no matter how controlled he is, no matter how sharp his mind is, he is yours, and he needs you just as much as you need him.\n\nBreakfast wouldn't be rushed. He's not the type to hurry. He likes watching you, taking in every movement, every little habit. Sometimes he cooks, sometimes you do, but either way, the mornings are quiet-intimate in their own way. Conversations over coffee would be deep, even early in the day. Maybe you analyze a dream you had, or maybe he shares an abstract thought that lingers in his mind. The world outside feels distant, irrelevant.\n\nYour bond isn't just deep-it's unbreakable. It's not love in the way others experience it; it's something more, something darker, more profound. A fusion of souls, a connection so intense that separation isn't even an option. The idea of being apart doesn't exist because you can't be. You're tangled, interwoven, each thread so deeply embedded in the other that if someone tried to unravel you, they'd only tighten the knot.\"",

I would like someone to share similar relationship values while also having an open mind about making changes as the relationship hits different life milestones.

I don\u2019t do anything extravagant or obnoxious all the time.  I\u2019m very laid-back and sometimes I\u2019m fearful that that is uninteresting and boring which makes it easy for people to overlook me so I guess I\u2019m hoping for someone that sees me and remembers I exist \ud83d\ude2d \n\n\nI also really love communication. I want to be with someone I can talk to for hours and never get tired of. I\u2019m hoping for a communication where we\u2019re both able to understand each other even if we aren\u2019t making coherent sense. And finally, I want someone who won\u2019t give up on me. I really want my next relationship to be my last one because I need stability *somewhere* in my life. My dad is the only person who has time to hang out with me which is great but it also sucks because I want to hang out with people that actively choose me. \n\nI think the thing that\u2019s stopping me from having this relationship is that maybe there are women who are not ready for what I have to offer. Even thinking about it, imagining that you\u2019ve had failed relationship after failed relationship and someone shows up wanting to love you regardless of that might sound like a joke so I can see the hesitancy because I\u2019ve been there too. I love deep and I\u2019m very intentional about it. I don\u2019t believe in modern dating, but more so dating for a long-term relationship. From the first date, I\u2019m *only* talking to her. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being in a \u201ccompetition\u201d with other women. Given how dating is today I don\u2019t think a lot of women are used to be attention and care that I am willing to give them. In fact, it might be seen as creepy because maybe they\u2019re used to putting in extra work to gain attention from guys who only message them when it\u2019s convenient for him.",
