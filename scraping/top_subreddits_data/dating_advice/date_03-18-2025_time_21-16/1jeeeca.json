So I'm asking very truthfully.\nWhy do men send dick pics? Are you chancing it? \nDo you want a shag? \n\nDo you belive that women want those photos? \n\nWould you send a dick pic to someone that you are serious about?\n\nWould you send one to someone you saw as girlfriend material? \n\nHow do you view women who send naughty photos back?

Men are very visual creatures especially when it comes to sex and just a picture of boobs, ass, vagina, dick etc is enough to get most of us going. If you have some gay friends that get around you will most likely find a whole load of dick pics on their phone. \n\nHumans unfortunately have a hard time understanding the point of view of others and in this case many men think that because they get off to a pic of a vagina that women would get off to pics of dicks, especially if they have a large dick. There are some women that do and this just reinforces this behavior.",

They also understand that a woman sending nudes is an invitation or shows intetest.\n\nSo logically, if a dude wanted to express his interest. He'd send a dick pic. He likes nudes, so why wouldn't she like nudes?",

Every man was once a little boy who loved to play with matches. There is a thrill that comes from upsetting someone to provoke a response.

Exposing yourself to others for self gratification is one of the lowest forms of hedonistic behavior, but guys wont complain or go out of their way to report the behavior despite their being plenty of it done by women too. Its on the same scale as women who subject others to their bodies when wearing tiny bikinis for attention just pushed to a more extreme. It makes them feel good for others to see them when and how they wish to express themself as a control thing. Its a human constant in cultures that have loose family culture. Id wager instances are more prevelent in cultures centered on individualism rather than family centered society. Its a behaviorial symptom.

At least, in some circumstances.\n\n1, many researchers who study cave men and Neanderthals believe that one of the things that secured the existence of the human race, was how prehistoric women actually preferred parners with larger dicks. with human males being more well endowed than other primates. \n\nAnd, many women and even some men believe most human males haven't evolved much since.\n\n2, this is more controversial, but I've read a lot of posts on here from women who've had issues with their partners having smaller dicks. So it's really easy for men to be insecure about it and for some to want to be an overcompensating DOGE bag, and send a dick Pic, eventhough most women and many men don't want one.\n\nI look forward to all potential corrections, and angry replies telling me I'm a dumbass.",

Just incredibly horny people and very weird too... also they try to be your friends online but you can tell quite clearly that they have ill intentions.\n\n2. \nYounger guy, probably in his 20s... doesn't have enough life experience to know how women react. They think they're doing you a favor most of the time. They get inspiration from porn and their other friends. They might be a bit more naive and less weird than the other guys but still an odd thing to do for sure. Drunk frat boys too most of the time. The women that they see their friends attract are often pretty easy, so they think a dick pic could suffice as a form of interacting with a women they'd like to sleep with.",
