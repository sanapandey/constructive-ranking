It's not just aesthetically better, taller people have a better potential for higher salaries, socially more intimidating, and usually more capable at most sports and activities.\n\nThat being said, I have seen a handful of short guys in a relationship with much taller women so I know it's not impossible to date.",

Just like almost all these other 'nice sounding comments' like yeah just have other qualities bro.\n\nAs a relatively short guy myself (5'11\" in Germany surrounded by 6'2\"+ at work) i can definitely feel OP's pain and the truth is just it sucks there's nothing you can do about it and you'll always be at a disadvantage in life because of it. It makes no sense to make the pill sweeter... It's just how it is and knowing the truth helps more than these white lies. At least you were honest\u00a0\n\nCan't even imagine if I were like 5'11\"",
