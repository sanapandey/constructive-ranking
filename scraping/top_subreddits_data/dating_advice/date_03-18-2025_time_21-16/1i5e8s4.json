I was there.a few days later I contacted him to say hey this is where I felt a vibe shift and I should have communicated because I never doubted my feelings, but I wasn\u2019t sure about our long term compatibility yet (but I though that was something we could work on). I also confronted him about something he did that hurt me. And he said \u201csorry for how it went down\u201d. Honestly that was what I needed to hear because his failure to take any responsibility flipped a switch in me from sadness to annoyance.  maybe I\u2019m flattering myself but I think he\u2019ll regret this in a few months and I\u2019ll have moved on",

Are you fucking kidding me? This man wears his fucking shirt the wrong way every fucking day. If you can\u2019t remember to feed your dog, why do you think you\u2019re fit enough to be an engineer? He hasn\u2019t called or texted me today. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s said some misogynistic shit. I\u2019ve talked to him before about how he talks about women and he just cries and says I\u2019m trying to villainize him. I\u2019m not calling you a chauvinistic pig, I\u2019m asking you why you thought a rape joke was funny when you know I\u2019ve been assaulted many times.\n\nIdk. We\u2019ve been together for a while but I\u2019m hitting my limit. He cries and begs for more time but we\u2019ve been dating since like October/November. We\u2019ve met each others families and I love him when he\u2019s not on some weird \u201cbiological\u201d tirade. He always starts shit about women but gets upset if I rant about the men I work with. \n\nTiiiiirrreeeddd. Don\u2019t care enough to be the one to reach out first. We\u2019re supposed to hang out but we never talked about what time. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go over anyway. :( I shouldn\u2019t have to fight with my boyfriend just to feel like an equal in our relationship.",
