    "selftext": "TL;DR: My dog found a young boy who went missing for a short time. \n\nI was gaming on my PC yesterday afternoon when my golden retriever (who never barks) started losing her mind in a panic and barking like crazy while looking out the front window. I then saw an at most 3 year old boy walking up my neighbors driveway and into their backyard. No one was home at that house so I asked my other neighbor who has young kids if he knew the young boy, which he didn\u2019t. \n\nHim and I tried to talk to the kid who was not speaking and would just shrug. We asked another neighbor if he knew anything or had seen the kid, to which he had not. Those 2 guys took the kid up the street asking around while I went to get my phone and dial 911. \n\nWhen I called after saying my location and that I found a kid the operator quickly asked what clothing he was wearing and after I confirmed she yelled to someone \u201cthey found him!\u201d 2 police officers were there in under 60 seconds. \n\nThe boy had gone missing about 30 minutes earlier off a fairly busy road about half a mile away. From was the officers said the family was extremely relieved. \n\n2 female officers came to my house about 15 minutes later to finish up their report to where I informed them of my amazing doggie\u2019s actions to which they had my dog come out on the porch with them and gave her all the pets and scratches and told her how amazing she is. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for my dog barking like hell just opened up, who knows if that young boy would have ever been found. So thankful for my amazing doggie, she is absolutely amazing and I love her so much. \n\nA picture of the hero doggie is also attached. \n",

There are a lot of skunks and stuff out here so I figured he heard one or the wind blew or something. He would not stop so I was like, \"okay if I check the security cameras will you calm down?\" And he kept barking. When I checked my cameras there was a guy standing on my porch right in front of my front door. He must have tried to get in but I always lock all my doors and arm my alarm. I flipped out and called the police but he ran off before they got here. I knew it was one of my neighbors anyway and they eventually got him and he got evicted from his rental not long after. \n\nYou better believe that corgo got his own special trip to McDonalds for some french fries the next day as a reward.

My dog and my mom weren\u2019t in the house. I have a pitbull and hes really sweet but my neighborhood isn\u2019t very fond of him.. I started freaking out and got into my car and tried to find them. I eventually called 911 and told them that my mother is sick and that i couldn\u2019t find her or my dog. They told me they had just gotten a call about a dog in someone\u2019s backyard down the road. When i found them, my mom was on her knees praying to a tree and my dog was just sitting right next to her. No leash and he just sat with her. I think if he wasn\u2019t with her the outcome would\u2019ve been a lot different. My mom went to a facility afterwards to get help and now she\u2019s medicated and doing way better",

Luckily I had only made it two streets away before some neighbors who sit in lawn chairs in their front yard saw a kid walking down the street by themself. My mom was frantic, called the cops and had my big brothers stationed at the front and back doors in case I came back.\n\nluckily the neighbor walked back down the street with me and we were reunited, but when my mom called the cops back to tell them I was found, she tells me that they were unnecessarily rude about it. Instead of saying oh good, I'm glad she was found, it was more something to the affect of \" you got lucky, she could have died\" and my mom tells me she yelled back \" I am lucky, I don't need you to tell me that!\" And hung up. \n\nI'm so glad this doggy alerted you, it's so easy to lose a kid from one moment to the next, it can happen to anyone!

My family dog was passionate about looking out the window and we trained him not to bark loudly at random shit but we allowed him to grumble and *woof* which, as a Rottweiler, was always hilarious because he had a pretty strong woof. He would only bark if people actually approached the house.",
