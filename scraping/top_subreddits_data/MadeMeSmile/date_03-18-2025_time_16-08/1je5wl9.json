I said yes.\n\nThey explained the PM would probably be there.\n\nDay of comes and we all meet at the Nature museum. We're sectioned off into smaller groups and told he's going to be coming and doing a quick photo with each group\n\nThe group I was in was the first one he walked up to. I was standing in the front of the group with some others. He came up, shook hands and quickly slid in to get a picture taken. He squeezed in beside me and it happened so fast, I didn't have a chance to give any space and my hand grazed the Prime Minister of Canada's ass.\n\nIt was perky\n\nETA: I hadn't thought about this in *years* so thanks for that LOL",

So if you're looking for something specific, you're probably going to want to go somewhere else. \n\nLike, you can buy a TV there, but it's not an electronics store. You can buy clothes, but it's not a clothing store. Shoes and boots, but it's not a shoe store. It's just... Canadian Tire.",

Trudeau and his administration attempted to hide this fact by artificially inflating the immigration numbers and keeping the housing bubble going in order to artificially boost GDP, which caused further issues and strain on our existing infrastructure and markets.  When you adjust for these manipulations we haven't experienced GDP growth since he's been in office.\n\n\\- The negative per capita GDP growth has had tremendous issues our country.  We are experiencing record high \"brain drain\" in our economy as we lose the most talented professionals who leave for areas with better taxes and because the constraints of becoming an entrepreneur are so much more difficult here than they are in the US.  In fact, our labour productivity per person is now 20% lower than that of the US: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/canada-us-productivity-gap-returns-trend-michael-willox/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/canada-us-productivity-gap-returns-trend-michael-willox/)\n\n\\- He/his administration have spent more and accrued more debt than any other administration before him in Canadian history.  He embraced significant deficient spending even outside crisis times like COVID, with no clear direction, plan, or oversight/means to ensuring those funds were spent efficiently.  (Which also lead to some of the largest and most frequent financial frauds our country has ever seen).\n\n\\- While the increased spending put us in a horrendous economic position under tremendous debt, standards of living, and economic productivity have cratered.  We might has well have put all that money in a giant pile and lit it on fire.\n\n\\- Housing affordability and cost of living are in the absolute worst position they have ever been in for our country.  The housing / real-estate asset bubble is being willfully propped up by our government to protect his administrations investments and the moronic boomers who think home equity is a retirement plan.  It is impossible for young people to afford housing in our most popular cities and the administration has done nothing at tackling the constraints around supply/construction.  They have done everything they can to limit new home buyer constraints and offer easy/free ways to get more money (further inflating prices), so that they can keep the bubble sustained.  **ALSO REAL-ESTATE / CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS FOR 20% OF OUR FUCKING GDP.  WHEN YOU ADD IN THE POINT OF HOW INFLATED BOTH THESE ARE FROM THE HOUSING BUBBLE, YOU START TO REALIZE WHAT A DIRE POSITION OUR COUNTRY IS IN FROM A GDP PERSECTIVE**.  I'm an engineer with an MBA that works in real-estate / construction by the way, so I know both these industries first-hand with over a decade of experience.\n\n  \nCont'd below.",

Mature response as opposed to childish insults.\nI'm good to discuss your points, and if it doesn't get to long, I can try to counter with some of the reasons he was successful (not perfect, but the achievements some might not know or forget).\nFirst, you mention GDP, as many do. Canada\u2019s per capita GDP growth has been slow, but this is not solely a Trudeau issue, it\u2019s a global trend. Many developed economies have struggled with per capita GDP growth post-pandemic, including Germany and the UK. Inflation, global supply chain issues, and high interest rates (set by the Bank of Canada, not the government) have contributed significantly. \nCanada\u2019s GDP growth overall (not per capita) has been in line with or better than many other G7 nations post-COVID.\nCountries like Germany and Japan have also faced stagnant or negative per capita GDP growth due to aging populations and slowing productivity.\nThe U.S. has outperformed Canada, but it has different structural advantages (e.g., significantly more venture capital, larger domestic market, and a stronger tech sector).\nEconomic productivity (a key driver of GDP per capita) also depends on private sector investment, automation, and education\u2014areas where Canadian businesses and provinces play a role.\nYes, you're correct, Canada\u2019s labour productivity is about 20% lower than the U.S., but this has been a long-term trend\u2014not just a Trudeau-era issue. Canada has historically lagged in private sector investment in automation, AI, and R&D, which contributes to lower productivity.\nThe U.S. has stronger capital markets and a more aggressive startup ecosystem, which naturally attracts talent.\nCanada has been increasing immigration, which lowers short-term per capita productivity (new immigrants need time to integrate into the workforce), but long-term, it boosts economic capacity.\nSome blame definitely falls on the federal government for policies that haven\u2019t encouraged high-tech investment, however, provincial policies, business leaders, and financial institutions also share responsibility. Canadian investors are risk-averse compared to U.S. venture capitalists, leading to fewer major homegrown tech firms.\nTrudeau\u2019s government has increased spending significantly, but much of it occurred during COVID-19 (you can argue about CERB, but countless honest Canadians were thankful for it)\u2014just like almost every other developed nation. While spending outside of crisis periods is a concern, Canada still has one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the G7 (around 107% vs. the U.S. at 123% and Japan at 260%).\nThe U.S., UK, and EU all engaged in major deficit spending over the past decade, particularly during COVID-19.\nInflationary pressures post-COVID weren\u2019t unique to Canada; they hit every developed economy.\nThe Trudeau government expanded social programs and stimulus spending that contributed to debt.\nHowever, provinces also contribute significantly to government debt, particularly in areas like healthcare and education.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate decisions have also played a role in making debt more expensive to service.\nThe cost of living has risen sharply, but this is due to global inflation, supply chain disruptions, and housing shortages that predate Trudeau\u2019s leadership. Canada\u2019s inflation peaked lower than the U.S. and has since dropped significantly.\nHigh inflation and economic productivity declines have hit most G7 nations.\nWage stagnation is a long-term structural issue related to automation, globalization, and corporate profit concentration.\nThe federal government can influence affordability through policy, but much of the economy is driven by private sector wages, business investments, and provincial taxation.\nHousing affordability is absolutely a crisis, but it\u2019s not just a federal issue. Provincial and municipal zoning laws, slow development approvals, and NIMBY opposition to high-density housing all play a massive role.\nMany countries, including Australia, the UK, and the U.S. (California in particular) are experiencing similar housing crises.\nCanada has underbuilt housing for decades, and rapid immigration has exacerbated the shortage.\nI will agree the federal government should have implemented better housing supply incentives earlier, however, municipalities control zoning laws, and provinces control rent control and development timelines.\nYour concerns are valid, but many of these issues are broader than just Trudeau\u2019s leadership. Canada faces structural economic challenges, and while federal policies have contributed, provincial governments, businesses, and global economic conditions also play a major role.\nLot more than I expected to write, but sitting in a waiting room and have time to kill.",

Our economy is not collapsing, and there are still, after 10 years in power, a large portion of the population that support him. I personally was ready for a change, but definitely not considering his time in office as destructive/awful. Take into consideration:\n\nIn the Trudeau years, the Canadian economy grew by 41 per cent, to $3.2 trillion. It grew by just 18 per cent under Trudeau's predecessor, Stephen Harper, who governed for roughly the same amount of time. Per capita income grew by more than 23 per cent on Trudeau's watch, to $77,700, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Trudeau's predecessor managed only a 7.6 per cent increase.\n\nHe manhandled Trump v1, has overseen the biggest drop in child poverty numbers (9.7% to 4.7%), CCB has lifted approx 400k children out of poverty, reduced income taxes for middle-income Canadians while increasing taxes on the wealthiest 1%, lowered the small business tax rate from 11% to 9%, legalized weed (huge $ coming in, less time and $in the courts/jails), national child care program, Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership",
