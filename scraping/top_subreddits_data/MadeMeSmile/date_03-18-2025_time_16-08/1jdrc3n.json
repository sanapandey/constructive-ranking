They treat their relationship the same way they do straight relationships.\n\nThey had a load of fans praise them for that representation - the behind the scenes episode where they read the letter out from a group of parents of gay kids actually made me cry lol",

Yeah reddit lost its mind with the whole all women are good, how dare you, etc. News flash that shit is legit huge fucking problem. Feet hurting because I had outgrown my shoes a year ago and moms got a new 10k boob job and nothing in the fridge again.\n\nRepresentation does not always look the way we think and this constant silencing of any criticism just ends up kicking allot of people who society already failed.",

In my experience working at a telecom R&D company, there was a goal to have 30% women in engineering roles. In certain countries, such as India and Poland, this was achievable due to cultural factors and a higher percentage of women in the field. However, in countries where fewer women pursue careers in IT, meeting such targets can be challenging. In some cases, hiring decisions may not always be based solely on selecting the most qualified candidate.\n\n\nImho DEI initiatives should start at the educational level by encouraging more girls to explore STEM fields. This approach takes time to show results, but it can lead to more sustainable progress with less friction. Setting a 30% target in a field where only 5\u201310% of professionals are women may be unrealistic, and striving to meet such goals could lead to outcomes contrary to the intended purpose.",

Historically, a black man in America who descended from slaves without money or education doesn't have the same fair shot at American life in the way a white man who descended from wealthy Europeans does. \n\nIt's perfectly fine to celebrate people for accomplishing things that is harder for their demographic to accomplish.

They are constantly out of products and in the store they never have more than 10% of the check out lanes open.  Their staff used to always ask guests if they are finding what they need and now they *never* do that. Literally I have not been asked that in *years*.  \n\nTheir drive up service is good but a non insignificant part of Target\u2019s success was how they got you to impulse buy.  People always used to say \u201cI walk into Target for 10 things and I leave with 15 things.\u201d  (The numbers vary but the point is the more people use drive up the less they are impulse buying.  \n\n\nThey must have shit leadership at the top or something\u2026 I have little doubt that 10-15 years ago Target would have taken the same route as Costco.  \n\n\nFuck Target.",

They dont think disabled people should have access to healthcare if they cant afford it. Republicans in many states consistently vote down measures to provide free school lunches to poor children. \n\nThe current administration has destroyed the Department of Education, which was critical in providing resources to schools so they could afford Special Education programs and classes. Most local governments provide funding for schools, but most schools cant afford the extra costs of teaching disabled people or providing them resources.\n\nMany Republicans currently in congress wish to absolve Social Security. That is the only way some disabled people can make money if they're too disabled to work. They would have to start begging on the streets for money.\n\n Its not that Republicans want to literally kill disabled people, but there are some extremists that dont want to provide any tax dollars to help disabled people, because they lack compassion and empathy, and dont care if a lack of resources will make disabled people die.",

This is incredibly harmful to self esteem. You say you are a father, so imagine how would you feel if you couldn't have kids and someone said \"oh you seem so happy, but I just can't get over the fact that you will never experience being a parent.\" \n\n  \nI am happy to try and explain better. I know you are coming from a good and compassionate place. Ableism is one of the least obvious -ism's. My girlfriend has been in a wheelchair her whole life and tells me she only really became aware of her own ableism in and after college.",

You assume that a white candidate is always the most qualified, even when you have *no other information* regarding a situation. Are you sure that's reasonable?\n\nConsider **individual instances** -  Individual listings for individual areas in individual jobs. Is there *always* going to be a 'more qualified white person' applying to *every single one-?* I have doubts about that.\"\n\nThis conversational track serves two primary purposes - To bring that subconscious assumption into the conscious, and to allow you to force acknowledgement afterwards\n\nA reasonable person may be surprised at how this was, in fact, an assumption.. You may find, however, that this person will double down - and this creates an opportunity to force that. *They just may believe* that 'white people' are *inherently* more competent than others, and this can give you a chance to press, and make them verbalize that- Giving you the opportunity to apply dismissal and shame\n\nThis, in either case, offers you the greatest opportunity to inspire change",

I\u2019m so happy to see these things being normalized now. I couldn\u2019t even imagine seeing another child in a wheelchair being a clothing model. I couldn\u2019t imagine tv or movie characters being wheelchair users and *not* having that pertain to their story arcs. I wish I grew up with these sorts of things. It would have made me feel less alone.",

Republicans\u2019 plot to gut Medicaid spending including possibly \u201cblock granting\u201d it to states to spend as they see fit bodes ill for high-cost per beneficiary programs like TEFRA. \n\nRepublicans are using obfuscating doublespeak such as \u201creforming Medicaid\u201d to mislead Americans that actual beneficiaries won\u2019t lose coverage. With the bloated U.S. defense budget sacrosanct from habitual liar Elon Musk\u2019s Orwellian \u201cGovernment Efficiency\u201d schtick, the chainsaw Musk gleefully wielded at the Conservative Political Action Committee conference will fall on Medicaid and potentially Medicare and Social Security. Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cprotect\u201d these programs is as worthless as all his other broken campaign promises dripping in dishonesty. \n\nIf private insurance is somehow available/affordable for families with a disabled child or children, it\u2019s likely due to Obamacare\u2019s specific requirement that pre-existing conditions be covered. \n\nIn 2017, Republicans came within one vote of passing the perversely-titled American Health Care Act. Besides gutting Medicaid and allowing insurers to significantly hike premiums based on the age of the insured, this Trump supported legislative trash would\u2019ve no longer required insurers cover  of pre-existing conditions and forced Americans with high medical bills and/or catastrophic illnesses into \u201chigh-risk pools.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans\u2019 spineless acquiescence to the Trump-approved Musk kamikaze mass shredding  of staffing and federal funding for a wide range of programs directly assisting millions of Americans, from Social Security customer service to 911 first responders,  is an ominous sign that Republicans will also mount another attempt to kill Obamacare\u2019s pre-existing condition protections.\n\nFor Republicans kowtowing to the Trump-Musk scorched earth assault on the federal safety net, this little boy and millions like him are as disposable as yesterday\u2019s garbage.",

It just turned out they had a disability. Some had better levels of hearing and communication than others.\n\nThey were all older white people, and I was this young black guy. Our work area consisted of all ages, races, genders, nationalities etc. Everyone treated each other equally. They taught me how to sign the alphabet and rudimentary words. Later on, I actually worked with their kids, who ironically were not disabled. It was the definition of DEI. People don't understand our differences are what make us stronger as a species.

Which is why she didn't. She wore her hair short until she was an adult because the only heroes she could relate to were *not* children in wheelchairs or girls doing sports. The first were non-existent, the second rare and if present, not well done.\n\nI still remember the first time I saw a wheelchair using character in kids' media. I was 12 - she was 17 and it didn't do her any good anymore at that point.\n\n\n\nOnly people who don't know what it's like to be invisible think that representation doesn't matter.
