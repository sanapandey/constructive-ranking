However, they\u2019re domesticated and have had artificial selection for these traits along with these traits making them more successful evolutionarily. Does soft eyes generalize in sloths? I can\u2019t say - I don\u2019t know enough about sloth behavior to say with confidence either way BUT the parsimonious answer is no. Sloths are not domesticated nor do they have frequent interactions with humans since their habitat isn\u2019t necessarily urban. This is most likely something anthropomorphizing too much.",

I have literally had hours upon hours examining behavior like this and having this exact sort of intellectual discussion surrounding if a behavior is being anthropomorphized. In my experience, people are often upset when they realize their bias towards anthropomorphism is likely the explanation for their reasoning behind a behavior and that the explanation is some other ethological reasoning. So, I was wondering if I would be subject to similar distaste for my questioning of this behavior - I guess we\u2019re seeing that in the downvotes. We WANT animals to be like us. I truly understand that - it\u2019s why I studied what I did! I too am often disappointed for similar reasons but with empiricism, the scientific method and real research I do believe that we\u2019ll find that nonhuman animals are more like humans than we presuppose; just in this instance though I am not sure we can ascribe the ideas of gratitude from a sloth without understanding more behavior and ethology of sloths and have a lot more context that this snippet of video gives us.",
