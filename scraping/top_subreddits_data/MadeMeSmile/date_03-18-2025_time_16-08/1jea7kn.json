While they can be a useful assistive tool for many people, the actual tech and business side of this is sketchy and scummy as hell.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hywtq5/comment/m6kz9ux/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hywtq5/comment/m6kz9ux/)\n\nTL;DR: The audio is recorded via your phone microphone, so you need to have that thing out at all times. It is then sent to remote servers for processing. The glasses were also sold for $400 last November and suddenly they're $1,400-1,800.",
