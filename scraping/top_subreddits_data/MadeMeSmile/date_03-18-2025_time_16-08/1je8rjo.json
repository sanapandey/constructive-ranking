He explained the rules of halal and from that point on, whenever we had a team meal (and that was often, I was on an operations IT team and would work 1 Sunday a month to do patching and maintenance) I made sure I made food he could eat. Of all the people I worked with, he is one I think about most often.",

I did not expect the absolute FEAST that they delivered in return.  I am loving all of this exposure to authentic middle eastern food, and it really solidifies our bonds as neighbors.",
