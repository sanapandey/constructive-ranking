The reverse could also happen, where Canadians want to capitulate to Trump's demands. It depends who weathers the storm better and with more resolve.\n\nMy preferred strategy is to start pivoting away from the US as a trade partner. I'd be pretty happy if potash and lumber was all sold to non-US countries. Oil is needed, but more difficult to transport.\n\nMy first move would be to let Chinese automakers into the Canadian market with the only requirement being that they build the assembly plants here. They can start selling cars here immediately, then over the next 5 years start opening assembly plants and work with Canadian suppliers.",

I got my seeds for this year's garden for free.\n\n- try out Community Shared Agriculture (CSA) baskets, which are weekly or biweekly baskets of fresh vegetables (and sometimes fruit, meat, or other local products). I've tried several different local ones and the produce is fresher than grocery stores, stays good in the fridge longer, and you're supporting your community. I've always found it good value for money.\n\n- if you're new to it, you don't need to spend a ton of money to get started. A few planters with peppers, tomatoes, or peas are a great way to start (and are fairly easy). You don't need fancy gardening beds or huge amounts of land; it's better to start small.\n\n- if you don't have the space for a garden, check out community gardens. They seem to be becoming more common.\n\n(/u/MollyElla511, this isn't necessarily for you but I wanted to piggyback off your gardening comment to make some tips for anyone looking to save some money on food by gardening this year).",

I'm not the most serious or prolific gardener; I partake in CSA baskets (biweekly) and use my garden as a top up. I live in a suburb, so my space is limited. I work a lot, so my time is also limited. \n\nI fairly consistently get:\n- lots of kale and spinach through the summer\n- lots of green beans, tomatoes, and cherry tomatoes later in the summer and into the fall\n- herbs that I'll dry in my basement (usually mint, some fennel, dill, sage)\n- at least a dozen squash and/or zucchini \n\nAnd then I experiment with other produce. Last year I did potatoes for the first time and got one successful crop (from some leftover grocery store potatoes that started to sprout). One year I got 45 jalapenos, which store great in the freezer. \n\nEach year I try to store more for winter. I freeze a lot of greens that I use for smoothies. I want to freeze some cubed squash this year, they always go bad in my pantry before I use all of them. I tried some pickling and dehydrating last year, which worked well. So I plan to do more of it this year. \n\nI also give a lot of extra produce away. If I have 6 summer squash that all come ripe in the same two week period, it's hard to use them all. So I give them to friends and family. My parents have an even larger garden than I do, so I get vegetables from them too. We try and plant complementary crops and then trade off.",

It's also a riskier investment. If your only concerns are maximizing your ROI and/or minimizing risk, it's probably not the right choice as there is some opportunity cost. The reason I'm choosing to do it is because I think investing in these funds will help to yield better outcomes for the Canadian economy as a whole, and I'm OK with it costing me a bit in potential returns.",

This is what I emailed them, via their complaints email:\n\n>Hello,\n\n>This is not a \u2018complaint\u2019 at Wealthsimple per se, but rather at our ornery neighbors to the south. I am requesting/urging a portfolio option that divests from US-based companies. If a trade war they wish to have, so be it; yet I wish for none of my savings to support the US side of things. I\u2019d\u00a0*much*\u00a0rather my funds support companies in the democratic nations of the EU or Oceania, even if I get lower returns.\u00a0\n\n>At the moment the hacky way I have divested from US stocks is to switch to the SRI portfolio and lower the risk level, which seems to rebalance the portfolio to the lowest amount of US stock compared to any other portfolio option. Outside of completely pulling out all my money from the WS managed portfolios and bespoke/manually investing my money (a risky thing that I would rather not do), I don\u2019t see a way to divest from US companies in Wealthsimple. If you can add this, please do! I think it would be very, very popular right now. Anyone who changes their mind can always switch their portfolio back to an option that contains US stock.\u00a0\n\n>Many thanks,  \nStingingSwingrays",

A drawback to tariffs when those impacted realize that they're trying to fix their blunders by holding the targeted country's families as hostage through uncertainty. Canada first, you get $1, I get $1.05.\n2) Get on a flight and find alternative partners faster than Donald signs Executive orders. Find and sign new free trade deals.\n3) Leverage the highly educated Canadian population to create new industries that replace lost industries.\n4) Use tariffs collected and debt to build pipelines, develop new mining infrastructures, and attract new partners that are willing to explore and extract our $1.7T worth of natural resources - even if it means China, Saudia, Russia but the agreements fully support Canadian employment, Canadian workforce, and Canadian royalties which are fed back into the country.\n5) Make US products so expensive through a triangulated approach with allied democracies that any lost industries cannot sell any of their products in the targeted countries (Big 3 automakers if they choose to leave instead of lobbying for tariff removal).\n6) Take off tariffs from China on their EVs, they're a behemoth who are subsiding their EV industry to gain marketshare - we need lower cost of living while we go through this, Chinese EVs available to public and security-concerned individuals stick with Japanese cars.  \n7) Create a new framework of a defense with EU, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. This would include nuclear deterrents against America (emerging) and other hostile nations. This would ideally replace NATO that the US will likely leave soon. Then the military would be an intercontinental security pact separate from anything America is part of, including a separate 5 eyes intelligence network.\n8) Accept that putting all our military and economic eggs in one basket has cost us dearly, just like the egg prices in the US. The national security threat of China being able to unilaterally pull moves to undermine Western influence was propaganda because our loudest ally did that to us anyway. Time to understand that if you're not strong and diversified on your own, your livelihood and lives are always at risk.\n9) America and China have both figured out - along with much smaller countries in Europe when looking at their GDP and GDP per capita relative to Canada, it's size, it's people, it's workforce, and it's population, as to how to build world class companies that are global, innovative, and attract capital from all around the world - where's the Canadian capitalistic spirit? The only \"bounce back\" is to become self-sufficient.\n10) Once we're even 1/3rd of the way to achieving these goals, the domestic production and consumption with artifically-controlled lack of competition in the US, would lead to lower return on invested capital from American companies, their international consumer bases will shrink, and it will lead to complacency, decadence, and lack of innovation. This will break the US even if everything works out exactly as planned by Donald - and that China, Russia, the BRICS would love to see. This is textbook cannibalism when you run out of food and you have friends stuck in the Amazon with you.\n11) Take away the soft and hard power, it's time to change our votes in the international arena to align with our policies and walk away from the 99.98% vote alignment that Canada offered to the US at the UN, WTO, G7, IMF, against sanctions and foreign policies, and choose democracy and Canadian values over American knee bending.\n\n\nBut this logic is too far out in the future and too difficult to understand by 80 IQ Donald, so we have no option but to think Canada first, like a true American capitalist.",

The wisdom of that time was to invest in gold, and physically hold it, especially given runs on banks and such. The world is very different today, but if a global depression were to occur, what would be the ideal ways to economically protect yourself now?
