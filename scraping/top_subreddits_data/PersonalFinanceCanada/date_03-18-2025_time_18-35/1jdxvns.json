    "selftext": "Hi.\n\n23M this year, graduating with a Computer Science degree this spring at a uni in Kelowna BC (UBC Okanagan). Originally from rural SK. \n\nI have $55k student loans, $23k from Saskatchewan provincial student loans with 7.2% interest rate that will start accruing after I finish school in April. The rest is interest free (federal/canada student loans).\n\nI have 1 year of Software Development internship experience, but I\u2019ve been having trouble landing a full time job post grad after hundreds of applications. I am looking everywhere in Canada, willing to relocate, no sponsorship required. My manager and everyone at the office I interned at got laid off, so no chance of return offer. I\u2019d say my resume is pretty solid. I am also curious and hard working.\n\n\nI\u2019m in a dilemma and lost of what to do after I finish school:\n\n1. Should I stay where I am right now (Kelowna, BC) and work a random job full time as I look for degree related jobs and pay $800-1100 rent, plus loans. I\u2019m willing to work anywhere, but i wanna make sure i make time for myself to work on side projects and stay in touch with tech\n\n\n2. Or go back to my hometown where I can live rent free but there\u2019s little to no job for me, even unrelated ones? \n\n\n3. Or any other suggestions? I appreciate it\n\n\nWill this get any better? Anyone in similar boat?",

            "body": "Another dev here. It is not easy to give advice as the market has changed so much since the time I was a junior looking for work. I am going to drop a few questions/ideas here - perhaps one of them might be able to help you a bit.\n\n1. How are you spreading your hundreds of applications over time? 5 applications every workday have a greater chance of success than 25 submitted on a Saturday.\n\n2. Have you looked at the government jobs? They are always understaffed and salary is not big tech flashy, but there are other benefits. And government jobs are less affected by the industry cycle.\n\n3. Have you used all of your connections? Family, friends, other students. The former manager that got laid off may be working at a different company that might hire you. The vast majority of hiring still happens through \"networking\" and not through the open application process.\n\n4. Have you considered staying in school for an advanced degree? Perhaps you could get a scholarship or a job on campus. It may be a way to last through the job market down cycle.\n\n5. Do you limit yourself in how you position yourself on the market? If your resume states that you are cool to write C++ for embedded systems - the HR would think you are not a fit because they are a Python/Django/React web shop. Perhaps you'd be cool with working on that stack, but HR already binned tour resume. Are you ok working QA (Test Automation is a thing)? Perhaps you could write different versions of your resume for different roles.\n\nIf I were in that situation, I'd be going back to SK to have lower cost of living, but then would save a bit and travel to Toronto/Montreal/Vancouver/etc for a month in turn - trying to land a job in the city you are in at the time. There is an advantage for being ready for an on site interview \"tomorrow morning\".\n\nGood luck.\n\nAnd if the above was too wordy, then if I just to pick the one most important word: \"networking\".",

I'd stay in SK, and in my application say I'm in the process of moving to whichever city the job is in. Most employers are happy to do remote interviews.",

Everyone said \"learn to code\" so a lot of people did and now there are a ton of people competing for entry level jobs. It was always somewhat challenging to land that first job because no one wants to hire someone with very little development experience, but it seems like an absolute nightmare now. \n\nI think immigration has had a big impact on the market as well. My company doubled the size of our development department over the past few years and almost everyone we hired is a new immigrant to Canada (mostly Indian, but a handful of Middle Eastern and Eastern European people too). Almost every applicant we get for our current technical job postings is a new immigrant.",

My first office job was about taking handwritten drafts of legal documents and typing them into a text processor. Because back then a typical office dweller would not know how to do it themselves. I am pretty sure that kind of an entry level job does not exist anymore. And not because AI got better at recognizing hand written legal documents. Which it did, but that's not the real reason.\n\nThe only thing changed recently, is that we all have to test our resume against those AI parsers of them. We have to make sure they recognize all the important bits of information, because the first line of HR is not looking at the applicant's CV anymore - they are scrolling the AI-generated summary of it. Those summary-generating AI are still terrible, so it is the applicants who have to make sure the formatting of their CV does not throw AI off.",

Make sure that you aren't just applying to software development companies, many large and intermediate sized companies do some in-house software development/maintenance.  Also government, though the process is super slow and might take a year.\n\nJoin some open source software projects and contribute bug fixes/development.  Many potential employers use open source software and having experience with it could put you on the short list of employment candidates.  One such example is the openstack project [https://www.openstack.org/](https://www.openstack.org/) .  \n\nGet yourself on linkedin if you haven't already.  Make it clear that you are available for full time employment.\n\nLook for large holes in your skill set (eg. do you only know Windows and not Linux based development?) and plug them.\n\nMost entry level jobs are going to be unglamorous maintenance of existing systems.  Set your resume up to look eager to do so.\n\nGood luck.",

Talk to people in person, talk to people online.

If that goes well, you would know if you will or will not get the job. Assess and spend some money to attend the in person interview if required. \n\nThere are also some consultancies that you can apply to which will take advantage of you. They pay 40k for first year and 45k for 2nd year. But after the two years, you are free to join the client that you will be working for. I have a colleague who has done this and is now a senior manager. FDM group is one such consulting company.",
