    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m reaching out for advice regarding my dad, who has worked as a dedicated electrician at BGIS in Ontario for over 20 years. Last month, he was let go without any notice or compensation, despite two decades of loyal service.\n\nToday, he met with union lawyers and was informed that, as a union member and an electrician (classified as a construction worker), he isn\u2019t eligible for severance or termination pay. However, my dad had always been under the impression that he was classified as a maintenance worker, which might change the situation.\n\nIt feels deeply unjust that, after giving more than a third of his life to this company, he\u2019s now left with absolutely nothing and no clear support.\n\nIf anyone in Ontario has faced a similar situation or has insights on how to challenge this classification or proceed, we\u2019d greatly appreciate your guidance. Thank you so much!",
