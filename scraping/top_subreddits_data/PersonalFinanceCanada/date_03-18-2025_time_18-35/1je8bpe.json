    "selftext": "Simply enough, I (33M) have very little understanding about finances and I would like to change that to better my future. I'm not exactly paycheque to paycheque but I feel like I may as well be. My current knowledge is enough to understand that just because you have enough money to buy something doesn't mean that you can afford it, if you don't need it then don't buy it, and when I budget I set everything to their potential max rather than their current average (not sure if that last bit is proper but it works for me). My only payments are rent and a small amount of utilities but im still only left with *maybe* 1000$ a month after everything is payed for and I don't buy much else. I feel like taking 12 months to save up 12k after living like an ascetic isn't great and could improve. I have no real idea of how investing works, I dont know what 90% of the initialisms mean, I have a pension through my work but all I know about it is whats on my cheque.\n\n\n\nI feel like im lagging behind in life a bit and just want to make sure im doing the right thing to give myself the knowledge foundation to be safe and comfortable in what seems to becoming a more and more uncertain future.\n\n\nThank you in advance and I apologize if this seems a bit disjointed or isn't the right place to ask this",

Please edit your post to add this information.** \n\n1) What is your intended goals/purpose for this money?\n\n2) What is your timeline, and what is the earliest you expect to need this money?\n\n3) Have you invested in the markets before, and how would you feel if your investment lost a lot of value?\n\n4) Is this the right first step? Do you already have an emergency fund, and have you considered whether it is sufficient? Do you have any debts that should be paid first? Have you fully utilized any employer match plans?\n\n5) Finally, we need to understand whether you want to be involved with this portfolio and self-manage purchases and rebalancing it, or if you'd rather all of that was dealt with by your chosen institution? \n\n6) For self-directed investing, all in one ETFs (based on your risk tolerance) are the easiest and low cost options for a globally diversified ETF portfolio. Here is the Model page and descriptive video from the Canadian Portoflio Manager Blog's Justin Bender from PWL Capital: https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/model-etf-portfolios/ & video on how to choose your asset allocation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyOqqtq12jQ \n\n7) For those who are not comfortable with doing the buying and selling of ETFs yourself, there is an option of a robo advisor. These robo advisors use similar low cost ETF in pre-determined portfolios based on your risk tolerance. They do this for a small fee, on top of the ETF MER. Still cheaper than bank mutual funds by at least 50%! Here is a list of robo advisors in Canada published by MoneySense: https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/best-robo-advisors-in-canada/\n\nWe also have a wiki page on investing, and if someone has triggered this bot then it means that this link would likely be very helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/investing\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
