    "selftext": "I recently had my CIBC credit card compromised, with around $1,600 in fraudulent transactions. As soon as I noticed, I locked the card and reported all transactions as fraud. Most of the money was refunded, but there's still $400 that hasn\u2019t been reversed yet. They sent me a new card with new credentials.\n\nAt the time this happened, my card was fully paid off with a $0 balance, and I hadn\u2019t used it for any legitimate transactions. My statement date has now passed, and my account shows that I have a $400 payment due.\n\nI called CIBC to clarify, and they told me to \"just pay what was not fraud\", but I didn\u2019t have any transactions on the card at all when this happened, and I haven\u2019t used it since.\n\nThe other issue is that when this happened, only 6\u20137 fraudulent transactions initially showed up in the app, even though $1,600 was taken out. When I called CIBC to report it, they told me there were actually 16 fraudulent transactions, all for $100 on the Microsoft Store. Could this be causing the issue with the missing $400 refund?\n\nHas anyone dealt with something like this before? Should I be worried about this affecting my credit score if I don\u2019t pay? Any advice on how to escalate this with CIBC?\n\nAppreciate any insights!\n\nEdit: All this happened a month ago and I've received the statement now (Present month statement)",
