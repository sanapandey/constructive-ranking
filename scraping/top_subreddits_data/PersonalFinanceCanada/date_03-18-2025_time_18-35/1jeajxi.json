In the meantime take some time for yourself and your family. \n\nTURN OFF YOUR ALARM! \n\nFile for EI right away, they'll defer until your severance coverage ends but you should get that started in case you can't find anything. \n\nFor the cheque, that's pretty standard for severance.  You should run it past an employment lawyer since it's probably around 25k, but I'd bet a hex dollar they tell you to just sign it.\n\nCheck for non-compete and nda clauses as well.",
