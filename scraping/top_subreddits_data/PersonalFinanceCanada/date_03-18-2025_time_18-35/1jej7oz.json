Obviously besides what I provided last year, is there any other personal information that they have access to this year (for example, can they access any of my CRA stuff)? Anything I need to be aware of or change? Anything they can do?\n\nOne of my T4's was mailed there and there's nothing I can do about that now (I am able to access through my CRA account though), but other than that I haven't provided any other info.\n\n",
