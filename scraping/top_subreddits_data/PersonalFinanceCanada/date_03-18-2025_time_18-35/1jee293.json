    "selftext": "I'm going to be paying off my credit card in full, by the end of this month (yay). The credit limit on the card is at $10k currently due to the kinds of purchases I was making on it. \n\nNow that the balance is going to be 0 and I don't plan to use it for any other big purchases, should I reduce the credit limit or leave it as $10k? \n\nI was leaning towards leaving it at $10k so the total available credit space counts towards my credit utilization percentage. Is this the right move? Or is it better (safer) to reduce my limit?",

In such a case you may be turned down due to already having access to so much credit. \n\nYour score can be super high, but a lender may still see the high open credit as a downside.",

Last year I was doing a renovation on an old house and had to apply for the increase of the limit due to spending. It\u2019s a travel points credit card so we like to put everything through it but realized 10,000 limit was too low for that time being. The limit increase application was a tedious experience and we only managed to increase it to 16,000 (which was enough) but I wished we never decreased it from 35,000",
