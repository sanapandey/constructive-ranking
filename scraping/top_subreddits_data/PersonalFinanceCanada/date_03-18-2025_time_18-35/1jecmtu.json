I wonder if my situation is \"complicated enough\" to the point where paying a CPA $150 to do our taxes would yield a higher return than their fee.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n  \nEDIT: thank you all, I'll get the CPA to do the taxes AND i'll do my own taxes and compare, then see the difference.",

If you actually did your book keeping properly then it's probably not worth it unless your business is pretty complicated.  If you didn't do any book keeping yourself hten $150 for taxes is a steal.",
