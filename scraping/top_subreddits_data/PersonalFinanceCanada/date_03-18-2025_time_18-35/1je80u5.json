    "selftext": "Hello PFC,\n\nI have front-loaded loan on a Mazda 3 Sport GS for \\~$34000 @ 5.95% for 7 years (PFC nightmare I know, I'm really into cars and needed a new daily so I didn't mind buying brand new).\n\nI did 7 years for the flexibility of the lower monthly payment and planned to pay around $5000 yearly lump sums to lower the financing period.\n\nHere's my current financial situation:\n\nCurrently 25 years old living at home.\n\nAssets and income:\n\n* Gross salary is $85,000\n* Net monthly is $4300\n* \\~$23,000 worth of ETFs (mix of XUS and XEQT) in my TFSA\n* \\~$10,500 HISA ETFs in FHSA\n\nFixed monthly Expenses:\n\n* $350 on utilities\n* $151 student loans ($19,000 left)\n* $240 car insurance\n* $430 car payment\n\nOther balances owed:\n\n* $1000 interest free deferred payment on phone due in June\n* $600 ($62.12/month) interest free loan on couches that I stupidly allowed my mom to use my retail account for\n\nI'm also planning to move out in either Ottawa or Toronto next year with my soon to be Fianc\u00e9, so that'll be a large lifestyle change. (not planning to buy a house for a while)\n\nSo my question is, would it be a good idea to liquidate around $10,000 worth of my TFSA to pay off a large chunk of my loan and lower the financing period to 4 years? Or should I just leave my assets as is and stick with the plan to save and drop $5000 yearly on the loan? (I know I'd be paying more interest because it's front-loaded and it'll take me a while to save for the yearly lump sums)",

            "body": "Paying down the loan is a tax free return on investment at a guaranteed rate of return of 5.95%, without costing you any TFSA contribution room.  If you liquidate your TFSA ETFs now and put it on the loan, you will get that contribution room back as of January 1st.\n\nBut it's a personal choice as it isn't clear that you'd be much better off either way if the TFSA ETFs are left in place for the long term.  If you think that the markets won't be going anywhere for the next year or are headed down, then you'd want to take the guaranteed 5.95%.",

Setting aside $500 a month for guilt free spending, you still have $2,765 a month for investing/debt repayment. \n\nConceivably, you could have the car payed off in 13-14 months without needing to liquidate investments. Or you could follow your plan of paying down $10k and refinancing within four months without needing to draw down your TFSA. \n\nThe car purchase wasn't great, but it's not catastrophic. It will be harder to rebuild your investments once you have moved out. Your monthly costs are likely to jump by $1,500+ and you will need to spend a reasonable amount on home furnishings, the engagement ring, the wedding, etc. I would bite the bullet and sacrifice lifestyle for the remainder of your time at home and try to avoid drawing down on your existing tax advantaged accounts.",

I'd say it's the perfect mix of a daily and fun car. It's comfortable, but it's still sporty with a powerful engine (I think mine pulls 191hp compared to others in its class like the Civic Hatch Sport @ 150hp). Another plus is if you don't like CVTs, Mazda still uses traditional automatics, but not sure how much that matters these days.\n\nThe interior is also really nice, it feels premium and all the buttons and controls are still tactile. I think the dashboard and steering wheel just use some sort of  'pleather' or vinyl, but it doesn't really bother me, I still think it's nice and it feels good.\n\nI don't care too much for the tech, but if you're looking for things like lane departure, radar cruise control, auto park brake, auto hold, back-up cam, blind-spot light, etc. they're pretty nice to have and are integrated well. I also really like infotainment and the control knob, so I don't have to touch the screen at all.\n\nOne of my gripes is the huge blind spot in the rear right, but if you set up your mirrors properly then you'll be fine. Another one is the lack of cigarette port, not sure why they took that out. Also because it's not CVT, it's a little worse on gas.\n\nOther than that, I can't really find anything else I dislike about it and I would 100% buy it again today. Keep in mind though I'm coming from my first car which was a 2008 Civic beater that just died, so to me this car feels like a lambo lol",
