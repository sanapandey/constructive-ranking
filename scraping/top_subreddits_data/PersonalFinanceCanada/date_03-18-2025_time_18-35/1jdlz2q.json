Looking for advice on what we could come up with that both parties will feel fair, or perspectives on what you think is fair and why. Huge thanks!!\n\nMy bf and I have been renting together in Toronto for 2 years now. We split our expenses and rent. \n\nAs we consider the future, I would be able to get a condo with a mortgage (or potentially with cash if prices drop), and my bf is living paycheck to paycheck currently. \n\nThe disagreement that we have is, if I got a condo myself, he doesn\u2019t like the idea of him paying me rent, and to me, it feels like I am being taken advantage of, that my bf is just going to live with me for free since he didn\u2019t contribute and we aren\u2019t married. I am fine with the idea of splitting the ownership of our housing, it\u2019s just that the economy hasn\u2019t been great for him.\n\nHe offered to pay for condo fees and property taxes etc but I still feel like it\u2019s not enough to make it fair.\n\nWe are expecting to spend the foreseeable future together, we aren\u2019t married yet because he doesn\u2019t want to settle down yet. \n\nI have a childhood of being taken advantage of, and I want to avoid myself developing that feeling towards him, it\u2019s important to me that things feel fair.\n\nWe are looking for advices for how to navigate the situation, so both of us would feel like we are being treated fairly. Thank you in advance!",

Do not buy a unit and move him in with you, it will be a nightmare if/when the relationship unwinds.",

And that's OK, IF she's OK with it.  It's really not being taken advantage of to have someone contribute to cost of living in proportion to what they can afford, I paid for my current wife's everything for years before getting married.  Our relationship is fine because I was fine with it.  She went on to contribute just fine later on, but the first couple years I paid for it all.  Just talk to a lawyer to make sure the property is yours without issue if you breakup.\n\nThis guy also REALLY needs to decide if he wants to get married or not, if you've been together more than 2 years past the age of 25, you can decide.  I know society will tell you otherwise, but no, it's time for him to put on his big boy pants.  Give him another year max to decide or don't waste any more time.",

So he doesn't want an extra label? Two years is honestly plenty of time, especially if you've been living together.",

We actually have this exact situation mentioned above except I make more than she does and can barely afford half the expenses. As I result, I just get her to pay what she can that leaves her with a reasonable amount of spending money and then I take care of all my our son\u2019s expenses. It is a point of contention because she doesn\u2019t want to get a job that pays more than min wage and I put in the 4 years at uni to get the career I have, and am still paying off student loans, but I try to make it as fair as possible. \n\nIn the end, if he can only pay 40% of the expenses, just have it written up that his ownership in the condo is only 40%, just in case things go sideways.",

This remaining amount is the running costs of the place. Split this by 2 and if he can pay this, then it's the extremely fair for both of you. Not one cent of his money goes into the capital of the house. Only you pay for the equity. \n\nIf he can't pay this and it's more than what he pays now, then let him pay what he's paying now. That is also fair, he's not paying more, but you get to buy a condo. It's a positive sum game so good for the couple. \n\nIn both these scenarios, it should be quite clear the condo is only yours since he pays nothing into equity. There is no such thing as a free house, even paid off houses have bills. And you should not resent him since it's your idea to buy a condo, so you should be the one to pay into the equity portion and you get help with bills and get to stay with your boyfriend. Make this clear demarcation and think of it logically.",

Consult a lawyer though.\n\nIt sounds like he is hesitant because he knows he doesn\u2019t see himself marrying you and is resentful of your equity. He doesn\u2019t see paying toward the condo as an investment for your shared future, but an \u201cunfair\u201d situation as you will come out of the arrangement with homeowner equity and he will still be paycheque-to-paycheque at the end of it with nothing to show for it (especially if the half of the payments would be higher than your current shared rent). That would be enough for me to want to break up after two years re: him not planning a future as a couple.

Do you earn significantly more than him?\n\nOne way that couples do it is they each contribute a portion relative to their net income.  Example:  you are renting currently and splitting expenses 50/50.  But if you are bringing home $10k a month and he is only bringing home $5k, then perhaps it would be more fair to split fixed costs 65/35.\n\nSo what to do if you buy a condo?  Well, he doesn't get to live rent free.  He needs to pay a \"cost sharing amount\".  Don't call it rent if that term frazzles him.  That amount shouldn't include mortgage principal, but it should include mortgage interest, utilities, insurance, property tax, and condo fees / maintenance.  I suggest using a fixed amount every month, say $50 or $100 less than he pays for rent+utilities+insurance currently.  Or if he'd prefer, add up all those costs every month then split them up 50/50 or 65/35 or whatever.\n\nThe key is to select an amount that is such that neither of you will feel taken advantage of of the relationship doesn't work out.  If you get married, then the property becomes half his anyway as the matrimonial home. (Edit:  and possibly if you are common law -- seek legal advice before pulling the trigger here).\n\nBut his request to \"live for free\", if that is what he is demanding, is ridiculous.  All of the above advice is based on the assumption that he is a reasonable person.  Which I'm not certain about.",

If he's paying some of your mortgage expenses, that could probably entitle him to some $$ if you sold depending on how you see it, at least enough to recuperate what he spent. \n\nOn a personal note, I had an ex who wanted to move into my condo like a month into us dating because I owned and was financially independent. He didn't have a job and could barely pay for our A&W when we were hungry.

If he can come up with 20% of the down payment, either from his own savings or from family, that is his proportional contribution to the initial ownership stake in the home. If he can't do anything, then his initial stake is $0. \n\nThen for all household expenses, split them 80/20. The agreement will spell out that he is entitled to 20% of the further equity in the home after the down payment and 20% of any growth in equity (or maybe less for the growth equity if his down payment contribution was zero). \n\nSounds like you do a 50/50 split on rent right now, so that is probably straining his finances.... Doing it proportional to income should make things easier on him, he won't be paying rent and he can have a stake in the equity while contributing proportionally to what he brings in. \n\nThe down the road, if his financial situation changes and he earns more, you can update the agreement, he can buy out a larger % of the initial equity and contribute more to the expenses of the home and earner a larger share of the equity going forward.... Or you get married and the equity goes 50/50 regardless of the contribution. But I still recommend splitting ongoing expenses proportional to income, anything else is not really fair.",

What I mean by that is each of your contributing an amount to your expenses relative to your income. If you make twice what he does, then you'd pay 2/3rds of the expenses and he'd pay 1/3rd (I'll use these example values going forward, but adjust as appropriate).\n\nThis works well for ongoing monthly expenses, but doesn't account for the deposit you've managed to save. That said, if you're currently splitting expenses equally, you could actually propose the new arrangement immediately while you're renting. If his lack of savings is really (as you say) because the economy hasn't worked out for him and not because he's particularly bad with money, then he should be able to start saving the delta between his current 50% share and his new 33% share of rent and expenses.\n\nHow he handles his newly reduced monthly expenses will tell you a lot. And if he's good with it, then he'll have at least *something* to throw at the down payment reasonably soon (even if it's not 1/3rd of it). More importantly, it'll build the trust you need before you make the decision to purchase property together.",

Simply paying rent is still fraught because once you two hit common law status in Ontario (3 years together, so just one year away), he may have a right to a share of property acquired by you during your relationship.\n\nFind the Law Society of Ontario and get a free 30 minute consultation with **a lawyer in family law** about cohabitation pre-nup agreements.\n\nAfter you talk with that lawyer, go back to the site and request another free consult with **a real estate lawyer** about sharing the purchase of a property or selling a share of a property.\n\n(The LSO doesn't let you get a free consult twice with different lawyers re the same issue, but you should frame these as separate issues and consult with different lawyers.)\n\nFind out what issues you and your bf should really understand before you purchase a condo on your own or with his help. For example, he doesn't necessarily need to buy a 50% share: a 5-10% share might be workable, although the smallest share I've seen so far is 20%.\n\nBUT if he does buy even a small percentage of the condo, he will be a part owner with rights whether you stay together or break up. If you break up, you may need to sell the place, then issue him his share, or you may have the savings to pay him off in full.\n\nWe are not lawyers. Lawyers are lawyers. Please consult now, then engage a lawyer if and when you're ready.\n\n**Second thoughts:** I'm seeing a few red flags.\n\n**\"The economy hasn't been great for him.\"** You have a significant disparity in your incomes. This is not insurmountable, but it's something you should not be over-optimistic about.\n\n**\"I still feel like it's not enough to be fair.\"** In addition, you two don't agree on the fairness of him just paying condo fees and property taxes, while you would pay the down payment and mortgage. But condo fees and property taxes will increase over the years, while the mortgage will eventually go down. Is he ready for that? You obviously don't consider that 50/50, and I agree, but again, you may not need to split the condo 50-50 as long as you are both clear that he doesn't get 50% (or 20%, or 10%) without signing some serious paperwork and laying out the appropriate payments. This is where you talk to a lawyer.\n\n**\"He doesn't want to settle down yet.\"** The CRA already sees you as a committed common-law couple after at least one year of living together (do your tax filings reflect this?) As I said above, the province will consider you common-law within a year. If he doesn't see himself as ready to settle down for life with you (I understand that this can be daunting at your age) I would be VERY careful about mingling your financial lives together, especially when real estate is involved.",

Your better off just buying the condo and have a room mate that pays u rent that u can depand on. And sooner you realize how much of a dead beat loser he is and leave him better your life will be. Sorry I came little harsh but if u find someone like yourself financially and mentally stable and on same goal  or better yet run into a man that can actually teach you about how to utilize your money will be even better and your life will dramatically change once u understand how money works.

You never going to time the bottom prices but wait till the crash and when it goes back up would be good time to get in.  \nGood luck",

            "body": "I'm not sure why you think you, as a couple, couldn't afford to buy jointly.\n\nYou can buy jointly with one partner making more of a contribution to the downpayment than the other (and income disparities are also not a financial impediment to mortgage approval). Both partners income will be factored in to what the banks will lend you, mortgage-wise, and the financial world does not care which partner provides the downpayment. From that point, if you pool your finances, nobody is paying anyone \"rent\" -- you are both depositing to a joint account and paying joint expenses. If you are committed to being a family, you both contribute and both benefit.\n\nMy common-law spouse and I have an arrangement like this -- I have significantly more assets to contribute towards the downpayment and a higher income.\n\nWe each receive our pay to individual bank accounts and after a few personal expenses (basically, things that could have tax consequences if paid out of joint accounts plus our budgeted \"fun\" money) transfer the balance to a joint account out of which all of our other expenses are paid (ie, our credit cards, housing expenses, car payments). We don't keep a balance sheet for who paid for what other than for tracking our joint budget.\n\nIf your boyfriend is living paycheque to paycheque while you have equal shared housing costs and \"expenses\", it sounds like either his income is significantly lower than yours, or he is financially irresponsible, the \"economy\" entirely aside.\n\nOne is just a fact to consider -- his career trajectory is not a reflection on his compatibility as a partner provided you share goals and values and are open to being the \"breadwinner\" for the foreseeable future (ie, unless he is in school or upgrading his employment prospects). Financial irresponsibility, though, could be a long-term issue that ruins your financial security as well if you fully co-mingle your finances. You will want to figure out which is the case before becoming co-owners of any property or potentially marrying down the road.\n\nIf your concern is providing all of the downpayment to purchase a home with someone who doesn't appear willing to commit to you, that is a relationship issue between the two of you (ie, you consider marriage to be an important symbol of commitment, and he is not willing to commit at that level, though apparently is willing to commit to long-term cohabitation).\n\nThe risk for you is that putting his name on the title increases your financial exposure under Ontario's Common Law asset division rules. Getting married would put you in pretty much the same asset division situation as though he were on the title, so that is something to bear in mind.\n\nThis is more of a relationship advice post than a financial one, IMO. You could look at cohabitation agreements or various things like that, but it seems unlikely that you will be able to agree on something that gives both of you what you want. And some things in a cohabitation agreement might get set aside in court as significantly unfair, so you both probably want to seek independent legal advice on that front before proceeding (which, IMO, is not a great way to move forward with a committed relationship).",

He can pay rent at your house, or somewhere else, but he needs to pay to live somewhere. \n\nI say this is someone who was in his shoes,, with a partner who made four times as much as I did. I was a student, he was a professional, making good money, and bought a house. He specifically wanted me to move in, although he hadn\u2019t proposed and we were not engaged. I did move in, and we negotiated a fair rent.\n\nThe problem was that I saw it as our future marital home, and he saw me as a way to offset his costs. So I paid for things like hardwood flooring, paint, light fixtures, and put a fair bit of sweat equity into the house. When we split, he tried to play the whole, \u2018oh this is my house you can just get out and I don\u2019t owe you anything\u2019 card. So I ended up having to take him to court to get back the money that I had put in to his home, which I couldn\u2019t afford to lose. It was unfair of him, and stupid of me. \n\nSo while I do feel like your boyfriend should be paying either fair market rent (or maybe slightly less), you also need to make sure that it would be fair to him. If it is your house, and all of the potential gains and losses are yours and yours alone, he is a renter and should not be doing homeowner tasks. So whatever your fair shared distribution of tasks as renters is should continue, but whatever tasks/costs arise that are homeowner costs should be yours. \n\nIf you get married, you can renegotiate the whole shebang then.",

This set up makes sense when one partner makes significantly more than the other due to differences in fields and therefore will unlikely see a significant shift in income but you want to feel like each person is contributing a similar portion. This is what my partner and I do because the wages in his field are consistently higher than in mine but we each want to contribute an equal percentage of our wages to cover our expenses.\n\n2) Purchase the home yourself and ask for a portion of the mortgage each month from your partner. This difference between this set up and rent is basically semantics but semantics seem to matter to your boyfriend so it's worth finding out why. I think what he wants to avoid is a situation where, if you two ever do part ways, he loses 100% of the money he's contributed which would be the case in a pure rental situation. \n\nBoth arrangements require an agreement beforehand where you spell out who gets what in the case of a breakup. For example, if he contributed 40% of the mortgage, you could agree that he get 40% of the proceeds from sale minus the original down payment. Of course, get this cleared with a lawyer and draw up agreements. You can always revise them as things change.\n\nThe one thing that gives me pause is that you state that he doesn't want to get married because he doesn't want to settle down. As a non-married person who now owns a house with my partner, we are committed to each other even though we haven't been legally married. Our house is OUR house. Consider whether you want to go down this road with this person who doesn't seem ready to commit to you. This will likely be the single largest purchase of your lives... do you want to make it with each other? Is his reluctance just the marriage part but he's otherwise committed? Or is it because he wants to leave his options open? I encourage both of you to sit down and discuss what your goals are, where you are in your relationship and where you see yourselves going.

So a fair rent could be split the interest+condo fees+property tax. \n\nSo for example, if your mortgage was $600K at 4% interest with $500 condo fees and $1200 in annual property tax, the two of you would split $2000+$500+$100 = $2600.

My ex didn\u2019t save any money she was 37 and owned nothing.  I asked her to start putting away money for retirement and laughed at me every time.  \n\nLove only goes so far in my books and I knew when I am 65 this would comeback to haunt my retirement as I don\u2019t have a pension and use the stock market for my retirement income down the road.  \n\nNo one can tell you what to do, but if I could go back in time I would have ended that 20 year relationship long before.  Now I have my own house under my own name only.  I\u2019m building a great retirement and I have a new lady that\u2019s the best ever.  When I pass away she can have the house if she can stand me that long lol.  She\u2019s a keeper!  \n\nDon\u2019t let someone hold back your life goals it will come back to bite you and you might resent him for it down the road.  This type of issue usually causes divorces down the road.  Sorry to say.\n\nGood luck",

            "body": "As someone who has had 2 long-term common law relationships (8.5 yrs and 11yrs) where the commitment of marriage has not been a priority, I can tell you it depends. It depends on your feelings, the feelings of your \"friend\"/spouse, what you want for your future (kids?/a home?/other financial security), and your comfort with this fact below.\n\nUnderstand that if you buy a condo on your own and remain common-law you will lose out financially unless you protect yourself. Too many women make financial sacrifices which is not a terrible thing when you work as a team and are at the same place financially. However, it sounds like he may have reservations about the relationship, his own ability to commit, or debt. Do not take this on. I myself was not able to find congruence with the kid thing with my first and wasted so much time. I moved to be with him and delayed my career while he went to law school and it affected my health trying to fit a perfect mold. I walked away with nothing and I am glad I did finally have that courage as I was not doing well in that relationship. Alternatively, my current relationship is also common-law, but we are still moving forward and are on the same page.\n\nI have a friend that has been financially the breadwinner of her relationship and his financial instability has delayed them from having marriage, kids, and has required a lot of patience on her part. I believe they are in it for the long haul; so again, it depends. \n\nYour boyfriend/spouse needs to work on themself, and until he does, do not buy (continue renting), help support him (morally) through the changes. If you are ready to move forward with the purchase, keep all finances separated and seek legal advice. My guess (not legal or financial advice) is a contract based cohabitation agreement that protects both of you by addressing the assets and specifies how they will be divided if/when the relationship breaks down. I really do hope it lasts, but you need to be prepared if it does not. If he is not looking to make changes, really question why and consider it as a big red flag; especially do not have kids until you figure out this stuff. Also, if he does not support you taking these steps to keep yourself financially safe, you should ask, \"why\" as it makes sense that you both would benefit long term if/when commitment happens and in the meantime he should have your best interests in mind.\n\nBest of luck in your decision process.",

My BF was about to go back to school for a professional degree and thus their income wasn't totally predictable or secure. I wanted to buy a place to live. Our finances for the most part have been relatively separated minus shared expenses and we had been living together and renting for some time.\n\nI ended up buying a house in a small town in eastern Ontario that I could reliably afford myself - even with the anticipated interest rate and COL increases.\n\nWe drew up a cohabitation agreement using our own lawyers that stipulated any specific contributions he made counted towards equity/ownership towards the home, and what would happen in the event of a split. In short, he would be entitled to the cash value % of whatever he ended up putting towards the mortgage/property tax/improvements anytime he was able to. Depending on whatever he was able to contribute each month, had parameters on what it would be counted towards in priority. We also had a clause around the elimination of spousal support in case the relationship ended (important if you are common law and a breadwinner and don't want to be on the hook for $$$$$ if you split). I maintain meticulous documentation and email a summary to him each month of the current proportions/contributions which he will 'approve' (requirement in the agreement) to ensure no funny business.\n\nOnce he graduates and is gainfully employed we will re-evaluate our financial and living situation. So far it has worked out fine, but it will come down to your partners maturity and willingness to do this.\n\nThe total legal fees for the cohabitation agreement ended up being around $1k, but this was a few years ago.\n\nFood for thought",

            "body": "I'm just here to inform you and everyone else talking about the potential 'nightmare' of owning a home with a common law partner who doesn't own with you. In Ontario, common law couples do NOT split assets when they separate. If OP owns a condo, and she and her boyfriend separate, the condo remains HERS and HERS ALONE. He is not entitled to half of the value even if he paid condo fees or property taxes.\u00a0\n\n\nHe would have to go to court and appeal for some sort of reimbursement, bit it would be exactly that - a reimbursement. In some cases, the person who owns the asset repays money invested into the asset by the non owner, but the person who does not own the asset, if common law, will NEVER own half the asset. For those who don't believe me, check the government of Ontario website here:\u00a0https://www.ontario.ca/page/dividing-property-when-marriage-or-common-law-relationship-ends.\n\nSpecifically, this website states that *unless your spouse agrees to pay you back, you may have to go to court to get back your contribution*. It also states that *common law couples do not legally have the right to split property acquired when they live together*.\u00a0\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because OP shouldn't have to worry about whether their boyfriend will \"take\" half their condo.\u00a0\n\n\nThe only advice I have for OP is perhaps have a discussion with him about his concerns about paying rent, what you believe is fair and why, what your concerns are, and options to resolve these concerns. In some cases, if you do not wish to marry or do not plan to be married until after you purchase a home, you can enter into a cohabitation agreement that outlines financial accountability on both ends and what would happen if you split. Also just be sure that you are okay being a primary earner and that these issues aren't deep-rooted in expectations about his ability to provide for you (if they are, that is OKAY but you want to be aware of it). Don't listen to everyone criticizing your relationship, do what's best for you but just know as common law partners, you remain individual people in terms of asset ownership in Ontario.\u00a0\n\nGood luck!",

I hope you will see how he might remember this situation, just with the roles reversed. That's just something to be aware of.\n2. Personally whether married or not, I would try and protect myself. Marriage doesn't really carry the same weight it once did. You can pretty much divorce for any reason. So I don't know why marriage would change the situation. Why would being married change anything?\n3. My personal belief is as long as people are trying to contribute to the household to their abilities, that is all you can ask. In you case, I would create a co-habitation agreement with proper legal representation for each side. Note, there's only so much you can do in this case to fully protect yourself. The law does conflict on weird areas like common-law married and this and that, but a cohabitation agreement is probably the best you can do to protect yourself. You'd basically say that the condo is yours. He will pay X amount for rent.... A lawyer can give you all the details. If you really see a future with him, you can say that he will gain equity in the condo as time goes on. That's some complex math that I won't get into here, but let's say each year he fully pays his half of the rent, he gain 2% equity in the condo.",
