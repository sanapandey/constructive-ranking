    "selftext": "* I'm a single parent making $95,000 salary\n* 2 kids, both have an RESP account since they were young (Wealthsimple is projecting $80k each by the time they're 18)\n* $15K in RRSP (took out $10k for first time down payment, working on paying that back)\n* $270k (4.5%) remaining in mortgage on a house valued at approximately $600k\n* $10K in TFSA\n* Maxing out what my company matches for pension plan, approximately $150k in there\n* $16k remaining in credit card debt (both are 12.99%)\n* $20k available LOC (no balance carried at the moment)\n* Received $600k inheritance \n\n  \nI'm relatively new to PFC subreddit but have been using the avalanche method to pay down my outstanding credit card debt. I don't have an emergency fund as I want to focus on paying down my debt and I always figured I can use the LOC or TFSA if a true emergency ever came before I have time to build a fund. \n\n  \nWhat are my best options here? My first instinct was to immediately pay off debts, establish an emergency fund, start maxing out my TFSA, and then put remaining funds into HISA but that's why I'm here - I don't know nearly enough about this kind of stuff. I do plan on reaching out to a financial advisor but wanted to get some input on here first.",

            "body": "So if I am reading correctly your only debts are your mortgage and credit cards. If so personally if I was in your shoes I would pay both of them off. People will say a 270k mortgage at 4.5% is pretty good and the money can be invested elsewhere for a better return but the peace of mind knowing your have no monthly mortgage payment is huge imo. that would leave you with 314k. \n\nAs for the rest Id max out your TFSA and have that act as an emergency fund. Its really easy to pull money out when you need it without any penalties. Also for someone who is 40 It wouldnt be a bad idea to also max out your RRSP as well.\n\nAs for the rest of the money HISA or putting more into your kids RESP seems like the move to me :)",

You can get creative with this as far as how much you lump on and increase because you don\u2019t need to save nearly as much anymore.  You can max your TFSA and RRSP from your non reg if needed.\n\nWith a 25+ year time frame your could invest in like 80/20 or 70/30 portfolio and likely outperform your mortgage rate over the long term.\n\nPay off your credit cards or any other high interest debt.

Single parent means no safety net means that additional risk is just not worth it. Job loss in a down turn means you have nothing to live off of. Mortgage paid off means you have lots of rooms to increase savings and a physical asset safety net should you ever need it.",

So that's another element of debt that I think goes misunderstood. And a lot of that for both of those points is this idea that people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They don't make them in Excel. They make financial decisions at the dinner table. That's where they're talking about their goals and their own different personalities and their own unique fears and their own unique skills and whatnot. So that's why I kind of push people to say like, it's okay to make financial decisions that don't make any sense on paper if they work for you, if they check the boxes of your psychology and your goals that makes sense for you. And for me, extreme aversion, what looks like an irrational aversion today, and I would say is an irrational aversion to debt, is what works for me and what makes me happy, so that's why I've done it.\n\n* https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/128\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSaRb-iFwPA&t=12m48s",

Then with whatever is left over put it in RRSP/TFSA in a diversified investment portfolio.\n\n  \nETA: if it was me and I was in your shoes I would also invest in electric car infrastructure for the home, not necessarily for right now (like not the actual charger plug in as that could change) but the supporting infrastructure for down the road as well all know that EVs will be mandatory within our lifetimes and getting a leg up on that sort of infrastructure could be seriously helpful down the road. But this is very situation dependant. Also I personally would spend some of the money on an emergency shelter and back up power system but that super specific to my personal preferences lol",

I like VGRO (or ZGRO or any of its peers) for that timeline. I would comfortably use VGRO for TFSA, RRSP and non-reg. \n\nEventually, I expect your money to double, then double again (look up \"rule of 72\"). VGRO, on average doubles every \\~7 years. If that continues, then your \\~400k you have invested now will be $1.6 million at age 55. If you continue other savings, it will be \\~$2 million. \n\nWhen I say \"retire at 55\", it obviously depends on other factors, it can vary from 52-60, but the alternative plan is 65-70. Its impossible to have an exact date this far out. \n\n$2 million will give you\\~80k/year (but you will no longer be saving or paying for a mortgage, it'll be more to spend than you have today). At age 65, you will get OAS/CPP and that will give you \\~$15k/year more. \n\nPlease, find a savings spreadsheet and prove it to yourself. No amount of Reddit will be as convincing as seeing the math.",

Since you now have 600k liquid, this is what I would do in my situation.\n\nSet aside 5-10% for wants/desires. These can a new car, vacation, electronics etc. No guilt purchases.\n\n70+%, invest it in a broad, spectrum of investments, in various risks, that will protect and grow your new nest egg.\n\nFor the debts that you owe, you now have the luxury of TIME to pay those off. You can reduce as you need or want, as you can pay off the lot if you wish. Most will say to throw it at the market and continue doing what you are doing. Others say no debt is good debt. Im personally in the middle. If you can make the debt work for you, then that is best.\n\nFor your credit card debt, it should be ALREADY be in the heloc, or lower interest loan instead. Lower interest then the 13%. Look into credit card balance transfers PROMOS ONLY as a cheap option (have to be on top of payments etc however).\n\nRRSP should be maxed out yearly (within reason to maximize tax benefits, and save the rest for the following years), then TFSA. That way itll help with CCB maximizing. Paying the FTHB back, pay the minimum needed yearly. \n\nMake sure to do your taxes and get your childcare, healthcare costs in there to reduce tax and max your benefits. Otherwise you are leaving money on the table.\n\nAlso, this is my assumption, my condolences.",
