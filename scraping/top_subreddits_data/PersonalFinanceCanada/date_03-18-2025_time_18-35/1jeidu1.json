    "selftext": "Hey guys, we are trying to buy a house in Canada right now and the closing is next week. My mom is planning to wire over $500k from her HK bank account to our joint Canadian bank account (under my + her name) in Canada. I am a Canadian citizen for context (she is not).\n\nI went to the bank today to check over how to send the wire transfer from overseas. The employee there mentioned because this is a large payment from overseas, we will need to go through additional checks such as proof of funds of payment, and it may take longer than we thought, though he is not sure as well.\n\nI looked this upon online and saw conflicting sources on this. Because of my situation time is a bit tight, we always thought you could just send a wire transfer and it would take at most 2 - 3 business days. We are wondering if people have dealt with this before and what generally happens if you have a foreign wire transfer incoming. Given the closing date is happening soon if the wire transfer can't take place, we need to find an alternative source of financing if it's not possible for the wire transfer to be cleared in time. Would appreciate if people could offer their thoughts!",

You can\u2019t get a loan for a downpayment. You should talk to your lawyer about pushing your closing date.",

We have wire transferred similar sums before so assumed it was fine, it didn't hit us that transferring money from one of her accounts from overseas to a joint account she holds with me would run into verification troubles. When we said this originally to the lawyer their response was they thought it was fine. \n\nWe are trying to buy it with cash (no mortgage) hence why we are wiring it.",
