    "selftext": "Without getting into the details of my relationship, the primary pertinent fact is that I don\u2019t feel like there is a way through this where we stay together. That is an unfortunate reality we are navigating but it is compounded by the fact that our mortgage renewal is May 1st\u2026our first home, having never done this before, life has been full of distraction trying to do the necessary things as well as manage the dynamic between us. Needless to say, the mortgage ball has been dropped. \n\nI\u2019m just looking for feedback on making a smart move. Refinancing was a goal because we have house related debt we wanted to roll into the mortgage. I\u2019m reticent to sign a long term loan (see marriage situation above) because, as I understand it, there are penalties associated with closing the loan early. If we do split, my ultimate goal would be to assume the mortgage myself and buy my wife out (primarily because I know I plan to stay in the city we live and I\u2019m not certain this is a place she would stay) as opposed to sell and divide any profit. Should we try for a 1 year or 2 year renewal? Is it even possible to try and refinance this late in the game considering I only have 5-6 weeks to do it?\n\nMy apologies for the scattered questions. If anybody can provide insight, I am grateful. If not, that is also understood. ",

This can be combined with a refinance (option 2) if you need money to pay her out.

If you have been late on mortgage payments, it can cause denial or way higher rates. If yes, prioritize getting all the installments paid. Also, in any case, get a broker and get some competitive quotes. Compare that with what your current mortgage provider offers, and go accordingly. \n\n>Should we try for a 1 year or 2 year renewal  \nIf we do split, my ultimate goal would be to assume the mortgage myself\n\nTry an amicable settlement with your spouse. Split the assets, and assess your financing needs. Refianance the house accordingly. I think getting a broker would definitely help here.\n\n>Is it even possible to try and refinance this late in the game considering I only have 5-6 weeks to do it?\n\n\\~4 weeks is generally enough time. But your bigger challenge is sorting out your financial needs. If nothing is know up front, go with variable 5 yr term, and refinance later. If you know the numbers, refinance now.\n\nMight also be a good idea to (independently) talk to a lawyer once.",
