    "selftext": "I think I'm lost. 27F single, no debt (no cc or student loans). When I lived in Toronto I made 90k working as a recreation manager. I moved to rural Saskatchewan to be a recreation director for 110k. Recently got head huntered into city management for 180k pre license. Workplace offered to cover tuition and books. Will be making 250k post license. I get a 9.5% matched pension per month (god bless Saskatchewan). \n\nI made some rookie \"investments\" just outta high school when I was working as a lifeguard and put my money (stupidly) into Cryp. I got lucky and walked away with about 250k by the time I was done with my masters. I paid off all my cc debt, student loans and bought a house outright in Saskatchewan for 100k. As I'm moving, I'm handing over the property to a management company and it will be rented out for 1k a month. My rent will be $800/month in my new location.\n\nI guess I don't really know what to do with my money. I've never done traditional investments before. I'm not sure what platforms to us, what accounts I should get. Can you invest your RRSP? I'm looking for a place to start or maybe a YouTuber with a general break down of what I should be doing. \n\nI've kept cash liquid because I stand in inherit property in Halifax and Toronto in the next 5-7 years. \n\nI really don't know what I'm doing and seeking any kinda help anyone is willing to offer me.\n\nI studied philosophy (mainly formal logic) so I'm way out of my depths here. I only have 5k in RRSPs since friends say real estate is more valuable. Not sure how true that is but I own 3 vacant lots around the country I hope to build on in the future. \n\nThanks in advance for anyone help!\n\nEdit: please don't dm me. I'm a lesbian, not looking for single men in Saskatchewan, thanks. ",

Especially with the economy changing so much I'm nervous about the future.\n\nMy only advice is weigh was you're attached to vs potential reward. Moving to Saskatchewan was the biggest risk I took the biggest reward. A lot of friends called me crazy but how have me referring them to the recruiter who recruited me into Saskatchewan. Not saying this will work for everyone. But I think I got lucky.\n\nEdit: I got lucky with crypto. I became obsessed with it in high school after a beloved high school teacher quit after winning big with crypto. My friends did much better than me. They actually bought houses in Toronto when bit coin boomed. But I was the chicken in the group but will lucky with what I got.",
