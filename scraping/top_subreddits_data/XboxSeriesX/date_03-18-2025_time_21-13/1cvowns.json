Was scrubbing through it to find the UE 5.4 stuff that was mentioned in the title but couldn't find it.\n\nBut what I found curious was that this video is seemingly spliced together from several previous demos and promotion pieces.\n\nSo my question is: is this channel and video actually legit? Or is this just someone stealing content and giving it a clickbait title?",

Although I would not be surprised if Ninja Theory has been beta testing an assortment of UE5 features before they were included in official updates.",
