This launch is simultaneous with the lifted embargo, not after, which puts the decision squarely on the consumer themselves: read the reviews first? or purchase first? \u2026 unless you\u2019re referring to pre-orders, which are almost always ahead of reviews and can be cancelled before the official release with a full refund (and the official \"play-early\" pre-orders do not stop early consumer reviews).",

Well, I'm just about half way through and I'm puzzled. This game is fucking incredible. It's exactly what Hellblade is. And it takes the experience to a whole new level. \n\nI'm now convinced that everything Microsoft published is going to be under appreciated. There very much appears to be an understanding in games journalism that feeding the hysteria gets more clicks. So they are no help. PlayStation has the biggest voice of gamers, so their negativity surrounding Xbox, the acquisitions, and anything released exclusively on the console ultimately results in a toxic cloud hanging over every game release. But even the Xbox fan base feeds the hysteria if a release isn't \"better than [similar game on PlayStation]\". Because people seem disappointed that Hellblade 2 is like Hellblade 1, rather than the \"better than God of War\" game that they apparently wanted it to be. \n\nBut as a fan of the first game, I'm loving it. And I honestly appreciate the variety in Xbox Game Studios releases. From Psychonauts 2, to Pentiment, to Hi Fi Rush, to Hellblade, and Starfield, there is so much variety that is severely lacking over on PlayStation this generation. Not that I haven't enjoyed games like GoW Ragnarok or Horizon Forbidden West. But there haven't been any games from Sony that actually surprised me this generation or felt like a unique offering within the industry (Returnal being the exception). \n\nI dunno. I think too many people aren't taking the time to truly appreciate some of these games that Microsoft is actually publishing.",

I don't really see the logic in that. Starting an advertising campaign 2 weeks before the game comes through social media, streaming services and even some sports events is plenty enough, not to mention the AURORA collab and all the other Iceland stuff and getting Heilung to work on the OST.\n\nThough outside the US/UK, the advertising for Xbox in general is very lackluster and I hope that they can change this before it's too late",

I just find it odd PlayStation doesn\u2019t get dinged for being so formulaic with them.\n\nHell, I remember when 360 got dinged for being a \u201cFPS Shooter\u201d box when that actually wasn\u2019t even a reality. \n\nIdk. I know I\u2019m in the minority. Just feel like they\u2019re all similar experiences. I miss the PS3 days when their console exclusives were diverse.\n\nLike I said\u2026not saying they\u2019re bad games. They\u2019re just paint-by-numbers at this point.\n\nBut they figured out the formula which is why they sell so well\u2026if you like GoW, then you\u2019ll like Spider Man, and you\u2019ll likely like Last of Us, Uncharted, etc.\n\nI\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll get back to the point of using their imagination, but I won\u2019t hold my breath.",

But I think Sony has some winners on their hands when it comes to their characters and franchises. People cared what happened to Nathan Drake. They care what happens to Kratos. But yes, they are very same same when it comes down to the nitty gritty gameplay. I borrowed a friend's PS4 last year and blew through Spider Man, Uncharted 4 and played a good chunk of God of War and Ghost of Tsushima all within a month or two timespan.  The formula was definitely getting a little old",
