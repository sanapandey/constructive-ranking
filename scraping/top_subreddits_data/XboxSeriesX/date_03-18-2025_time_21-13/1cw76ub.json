The only thing is when I\u2019m playing a shooter and there\u2019s sound below me, I can tell better with the A50s vs my Home Theater setup. \n\nWhich makes sense because headphones can create a sphere of sound all around you, and HT setups are limited to just the top half of the sphere more or less. Does that really matter though? Not to me unless you\u2019re playing a competitive shooter, because nobody else mixes sound from coming directly below you, and you don\u2019t really need to to be honest.\n\nEverything else sounds 1000 % better through my HT vs the A50s, much more clarity and quality. I prefer to use my HT over my A50s as it\u2019s much more realistic sounding as well, even though the soundscape is ever so slightly limited. \n\nI\u2019ve never had the experience of sound coming from behind me or over head and legitimately tricking my brain that something was actually there with my A50s or headphones for that matter. I have had that experience with my HT setup many times. Sometimes if someone walks through a door behind me in a movie, or talks unprompted, it\u2019ll cause my wife to jump because she thought it was real.  \n\nThe biggest thing I think besides speaker sound quality, is the low end frequencies being much more robust, and a subwoofer for any tactile response. Through the headphones once you compare, the low end is significantly limited. Below 150-120Hz, it\u2019s barely present. Your ears can hear it and it sounds\u2026flaccid? The lack of your whole body feeling the 60Hz kick and below is also a big piece as well. It\u2019s just not even close when you hear an explosion, vs hearing AND feeling it. The last thing for me is also feeling headphones on my head, is truly a very unconvincing experience, IF you\u2019ve experienced both. \n\nBefore my HT, my A50s were great. Now, eh, They\u2019re just ok.",

I think that anyone parroting this information here has never experienced a good atmos/dtsx mix on a 7.2.4 system (5.1.4 too probably but i have never tried that configuration). my reasoning:\n\n  \n1. ambiance is better with a whole room system than headphones because they can recreate an acoustic space in a way that is impossible with speakers so close to your head. with a good atmos mix, when you are in a cave it feels like you are in a cave, when you are in a cathedral it feels like you are in a cathedral, etc. it is able to mimic sounds bouncing off of walls and coming back to you and every sound feels like it is present in your space.\n\n2. bass is better with a whole room system\n\n3.dynamic range is better with a whole room system. you can have some stuff really loud occasionally where this is limited in headphones to protect your ears.\n\n4. no headphones is more comfortable than headphones.\n\n5. discrete sound channels are always cleaner than matrixes sound channels.\n\n6. in a properly calibrated system sounds can sound like thy are coming from insides of your head. in fact sounds can be mapped to feel like they are coming from any exact spot in the sound field.\n\n7. a lot of people do not experience binaural sound when using headphones because of the shape of their ears or how their brains work. \n\n  \nnow - I'm not saying that them putting all this effort into a binaural mix is a bad thing. the number of people with good home theater atmos setups make up a tiny portion of the user base, so having the experience available with headphones, and advertising that people should use headphones to play is great.  But not also mapping to spatial systems is disappointing. maybe its a budget issue, or a stubbornness issue, i dont know, but hiding behind the 'it has to be experienced with headphones because it cant sound as good otherwise' argument is just super lame. Really having a first party game using its own spatial engine instead of using the system level one is also super lame. if its so good and relutionary then why hasnt it replaced the system level one so it can work with all games? Look at playstation's tempest engine. when it first launched with the ps5 it was a headphones only binaural solution. a few years later, when sony finally introduced atmos combatibility, they made it all run through the tempest engine and then mapped it to atmos on output. this made it so that every game to date that supported tempest instantly supported atmos.  \n\nthis is a flagship first party title they have been advertising for years. they should have coded atmos properly and they should be saying 'for best experience use headphones or a properly calibrated home theater system with a minimum discrete 5.1.4 speaker setup. '\n\nI was so certain atmos would be an option that I was completely flabbergasted when it wasn't.",
