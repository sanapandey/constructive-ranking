God I love Play Anywhere.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s coming to Game Pass immediately but this is usually a step that games have to do to meet the GP requirement. Having a Windows version. So maybe sometime in the near future.\n\nCheck the link for a review.\nDredge is a beautiful and relaxing indie horror fishing game where you\u2019re a boat\n\nAlso shout out to Legion Go.\n\nhttps://xboxera.com/2024/05/19/dredge-is-now-play-anywhere-on-xbox-game-pass/",

Take Final Fantasy for example. Of all the FF games that went through Game Pass, only FF9 is Xbox Play Anywhere. And 15 supports cross-save. The rest each have a separate PC and Xbox purchase, and don't have any kind of cross-save support. It's just strange that 9 would have it, but 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 don't, despite all of them receiving Xbox achievements when they arrived on Game Pass.",
