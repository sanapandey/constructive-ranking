    "selftext": "Well,\n\nI changed from the standard Elite Series 2 Black\u2026. Long story short \u2026 my Black Elite stopped working and didn\u2019t have any actionable sticks or buttons working, the store where i bought it (Mediamarkt) was kind enough to refund all of the controller 2 years after i bought it. They didn\u2019t have the black one available, or i could not replace it with the one that i had, so i went colors!!\u2026. And got a Red one, .. i put some Gold paddle back and .. i dont know why i add some KontrolFreeks\u2026 all with the money that i got from the refund. \n\nSo what do you think? How does it look?\nI am a girl, and all my setup is kind of white. I don\u2019t have an Xbox but i use my xbox controllers with my Nintendo Switch. \nI think it was an upgrade, i like it more than the standard black\u2026 just i am missing the carrying case and the charger but i never used it in my original Elite Series 2. \nAttached some photos for the showcase ^^",

            "body": "Extremely slick looking controller! The ONLY reason I'm personally holding out on the Elite series controllers is because I am waiting for Xbox to release an official controller with 'Hall Effect' joy sticks. Regular joysticks use a system like a dial inside (potentiometer) to detect how far you've moved the stick. This system can wear out over time, causing the joystick to move on its own,  This is called stick drift.\n\nHall effect joysticks, on the other hand, use magnets and sensors to detect movement.  There's no physical contact involved, so they're much less likely to wear out and drift. This makes them smoother, more accurate & with less dead zones. Right now there are only two 3rd party controllers for Xbox that feature hall effect joystick.  One is the Gamesir G7 SE and the other is the new 8BitDo Ultimate Xbox controller. I have yet to get one of these controllers but as soon as mine inevitably wears out I will be trying one of these for myself.\n\nAnyways, excellent controller! Let me know what you like most about it after you've spent some quality time gaming with it. Happy gaming \u270c\ufe0f",

I cut them some slack on the first one, i went through 4 of them, most was stick drift and one was a dpad not working at all issue. They gave me a new one or fixed it free everytime so props to their customer service. The elite 2 controller, i am on my 2nd one as of now. My original had LB/Rb issues where they wouldnt register when clicked, i sent it in and they gave me a new one.. its been about 6 months now and the same issue is back again.   \nI love microsoft controllers and the feel, elite controller truly feel impeccable. Its gotten to be too much at this point though, why should i have to send in a controller i paid over 200$ for, multiple times? Some are lucky and it will last, most arent. The ONLY saving grace that has allowed me to stay loyal is the customer support and replacements that are free. \n\nI suggest doing what i am currently in the process of, find a nice controller of similar quality from a known retailer that has KNOWN reliability and the options your looking for. Im currently looking at some an am going to be switching away from elite controllers from now on. Despite the fact i love their feel more than any controller ive held. I am an iphone user, ive always related having a elite controller to having an iphone, a basic controller... android xD. BUT no more. Im switching to niche brands for the sake of reliability.",

                    "body": "So, the red one (there is a white one as well) is a \"core\" controller, it's just the controller with no accessories. If you want the case with charging block, extra sticks, different d-pad and paddles, those are separate. \n\nThe cost of buying a core controller plus the accessories separately can be slightly more expensive than jist buying everything together- the standard black Elite 2 comes with all accessories, but is a lil more expensive, of course\n\nMy first Elite 2 got a lil beat up (LB kinda janky, the rubber grips peeling like mad- GET THE WARRANTY IF YOU CAN) so I was considering the red core controller since I could just swap all the accessories over...I ended up getting a second black one with all the accessories because it was mad-money discounted at work since the box was opened already. Was gonna give to my dad as a Christmas present, but he didn't really want it so I kept it for myself. \n\nHonestly, I only used two paddles at first- one extra jump and one extra duck button for FPS games. Allows you to pull off slightly more advanced moves like being able to look around while jumping (since you can to use right thumb to jump- more I can keep right thumb on stick without breaking my line of sight)\n\nEventually I added the third paddle for a secondary minor feature in FPS games (tagging/callouts) and i finally added the 4th paddle again for minor features. Admittedly, I thought 4 paddles at first was a bit much, but it was easy to start with 2 and add them as it felt more natural. \n\nI hope you found this helpful!!",

I paid 60 for the controller. So I guess that's a good deal. But is there any way to check the warranty on the controller?",

When you have the number, go to the controller replacement request form and enter it in the serial number field at the bottom of the page.\n\nhttps://support.xbox.com/help/hardware-network/controller/controller-warranty\n\nMind you, if the controller was never registered originally... there's a chance you may be able to activate it yourself? I'm not 100% sure how it works secondhand...best of luck to you, friend!!\n\n(Also yea, $60 for an Elite controller, even just the core controller is a great deal!!)",
