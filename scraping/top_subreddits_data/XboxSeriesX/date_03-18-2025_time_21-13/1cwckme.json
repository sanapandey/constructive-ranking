    "selftext": "Recently i have been looking to get a series X and trade in the series S I've had for 3 years. As I want to replay some old game I have on disc from the Xbox one  days or to get cheap second hand discs. Also when I bought the series S I had an old 1080p tv, but now I have a 4k 144hz monitor and want to take full advantage of the 4k 120 capability of my monitor and the Xbox. \n\nIs it worth getting a series X at this point and if so is there any good place I can trade in a series S for a good deal.   \nI live in the UK.\n\nThank you in advance \ud83d\ude0a",

I found a lot people around me who have switched console have ended up rebuying games they already had 100's of hours on, on Xbox anyway.",
