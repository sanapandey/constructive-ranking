I know Hellblade 2 is gonna get most of the attention but this is some good counter programming haha.\nI pre installed it with the Xbox mobile app and it\u2019s like 12GB. I\u2019ll be playing it day 1!\nBtw it\u2019s Play Anywhere for anyone who has a PC or ROG Ally for anyone who gets it digitally.\nI do want a physical version at some point just to have it though haha",
