You could move the sand and there was a projector that would change the color of the sand to mimick how water would run on the new terrain. So if I dug a one inch path in the sand the projector would recognize the path and put a blue light on that sand to make it look like a river. \n\nWhen I looked at how they were watching my movements there was a Kinect. So the Kinect was monitoring my movements in the sand, judging depth and elevation of the sand and then telling the projector where to and not to put water. Blew my mind.",

It is the sort of thing that thrives at arcades and events because you can make adequate space while it is also not going to be used by each person for long periods.\n\n\nToo few people had space for it, gaming with your full body is a legit workout so games can't be too deep which pushes them into being gimmicks that get boring.\n\n\nI had the EyeToy for PS2 as a kid and my step dad got a Kinect when they were new. The tech was a massive improvement of a cool concept that certainly burnt energy for kids but ultimately it had a real ceiling for its potential application in console gaming. It could have been a cool way to revive peripherals like the old light guns and rail shooter games but that wouldn't have sustained it as a project.\n\n\nOutside of VR we don't really see companies playing with novelty peripherals anymore but it definitely used to make the industry feel fun. I still have my NES and SNES light guns and my Steel Battalion controller but have given away some other consoles and their peripherals, they're reminders of how gaming didn't used to be so standardised and formulaic.",

And we've seen that VR isn't actually selling all that well overall which is why some companies have already pulled out of the market. As much as these devices open new ways to interact and play, they also limit what games can be as you cannot play a binge session or sustain intense action.",

My bedroom was upstairs and Xbox was downstairs in the living room.\n\n  Walking down the stairs: \"Xbox On\"\n\n  Walking past the living room: Xbox play game name\"\n\n  Then I'd grab a beer and by the time I sat down my game was ready to go. Sure it was kind of silly, but kinda nice sometimes when it worked.",

It's somewhat surprising that Xbox has survived the past 10+ years of nonsensical mismanagement of many fronts. They tried forcing the Kinect down people's throats, then wholly abandoned it.\n\nThey signed a bunch of second-party game deals, then let almost all of those walk while firing a bunch of in-house talent. After that came the 5+ years of buying studios and delays releases like crazy. They made a big deal about their entertainment division, but shut it down before it even got a project together.\n\nWe were given a multitasking-focused XB1, only to have all of that stuff stripped to the bone. MS kept rebranding their music service, while wondering how a platform no one could identify with (since the name kept changing) didn't have a lasting place in that industry.\n\nMiceosoft is loaded with consumer-focuaed projects that didn't get enough time to find their footing. They frequently show up late to a fad and forget to buy in themselves, leaving consumers with half-finished devices and products that rarely get the polish or support they need/deserve.",

It was so easy to walk into a room and say \u201cXbox on\u201d, and it felt good to hear the console chime after doing so. Being able to launch into any game or app with the \u201cXbox go to\u201d command similarly saved me so much goddamn time going through menus. Having voice control for volume allowed me to adjust that without taking my hands or eyes off whatever game.\n\nI miss all those features. I even miss the \u201ctouch\u201d controls. Using hand gestures to navigate Netflix from bed was so leisurely, even if it was a bit clunky. Also, being able to just raise a game download card QR code into the air to redeem the code was its own little golden age. No more typing in 25-character codes. Or however many characters it was. I didn\u2019t *need* a camera on my Kinect, but I enjoyed features like this.\n\nBut I just didn\u2019t give a shit about playing games with the Kinect. The Kinect-exclusive games always seemed gimmicky and stupid to me, so I never got a single one. Games like Dead Rising 3 which had you swinging your arms around to knock zombies off of you, or Alien Isolation which uses the Kinect microphone to have the alien detect if you made too much IRL noise always felt gimmicky, never immersive. I always turned those features off if I could.\n\nPassive features were fine, like Halo Anniversary using Kinect to scan enemies and create an in-game lore page for them. But this feature could *easily* be a button press IMO.\n\nUltimately I fucking loved the Kinect\u2019s set of features. I wish Xbox still had a lot of functionality I enjoyed last gen. I was sad in 2017 when I got an Xbox One X and had to unplug my Kinect forever.\n\nI don\u2019t see why they didn\u2019t take the best QOL features like voice commands and implement a microphone into the console itself to keep these features. Kinect\u2019s biggest weakness was that Microsoft didn\u2019t understand the appeal of the device. It didn\u2019t need to be its own device at all. Its best features could easily have been implemented into the console itself.",

That being said the kinect sold 8 million units in the first 60 days of release and had 24 million units by February 2013.\n\n>When I say that Kinect destroyed XBOX, I mean as a brand.

And all of the energy and money that had been spent centering Kinect as a system-seller, had to suddenly be shifted everywhere else (most of it just evaporating altogether)\n\nlol what? What studios did Xbox have work on kinect games besides Rare? By the way Rare's most successful games to date is Kinect Sports. Kinect Adventures was made by a kinect specific studio that Xbox has consolidated, Fable The Journey Xbox forced them to make much like Fable Legends which led to Xbox shutting the studio down (Lionhead wanted to make Fable 4), and any other Xbox developed game only used voice commands which is about as little effort they could have put in to support an accessory they forced on the entire user base. If anything Xbox lack of trying to use the kinect is the reason it died, why should other developers bother supporting it if Xbox themselves only do bare minimum? Even so it was third party devs like Harmonix with Dance Central and Disney Fantasia that made the must have games for kinect NOT Xbox.\n\nAs for the Kinect v2 it certainly did not make the weaker Xbox One worth $100 more than the PS4 but it certainly did not help when Xbox seemed to have zero idea what to do with the kinect v2 when they forced bundled it with the Xbox One forcing the price disadvantage, that was Xbox greed and arrogance.\n\nAgain and I can't stress this enough the kinect did not in any way stop Xbox from making good games, that was Xbox just seemingly not trying anything outside Halo, Gears, Forza and nothing else even with the large amount of IPs they owned then and still do now. Xbox themselves had done little to nothing in terms of exclusives to make the Xbox One appealing over the competition and the sales in both hardware and software showed gamers agreed.\n\n>Xbox was never as successful as 360 generation. It's a tough nut to crack, for sure.\n\nXbox put themselves in that situation though, the second they stopped having exclusive games and shared them all with PC they gave very little reason to own the console itself especially with PC gaming growing. Add in Game Pass and day one Xbox releases they literally are telling not to buy their games but instead rent them with their subscription service then seemingly are baffled when their software sales suck so they close down studios. Unpopular opinion that people don't want to hear but the only way to make the Xbox console appealing again is to give it exclusives again, not shared with PC either but actual exclusives, on top of that no more day one releases on Game Pass so people will actually buy your games again. They have so many IPs now with all these acquisitions there is something for everyone with Fallout, Elder Scrolls, DOOM, Wolfenstein, Banjo, Conker, Viva Pinata, Dishonored, Evil Within, Hellblade, Call of Duty, Tony Hawk, Guitar Hero, Killer Instinct, Overwatch, Diablo, StarCraft, Prototype, etc they have something for everyone.",
