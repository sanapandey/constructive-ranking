I\u2019d imagine being a Microsoft owned company Bethesda is going to get more focus on console optimization like Starfield getting a 60 fps patch so soon after release like you mentioned. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty hard to come up with a list of PC to Console ports these days. The majority go Console to PC with Sony\u2019s titles being particularly poorly optimized for the platform. Some bad examples from the last couple years are: Forspoken, Horizon Forbidden Dawn, The Callisto Protocol, Gotham Knights, Hogwarts Legacy, Elden Ring, Midnight Suns and Dead Space. \n\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gamers-really-fed-up-with-one-bad-pc-port-after-another-2023/\n\nPC gaming, to me, is more similar to building hot rods as a car guy. They\u2019re cool and in limited ways they can have incredible performance but they\u2019re wildly impractical and expensive for regular use.

As someone who has gamed since atari/nes these console now a days load so fking fast as is, I do believe ps5 is a bit faster then my series x but either way they both smoking, it just quick resume isn't a huge deal to me. As much as i feel it was natural progression I'd say putting a hdd was a much better feature. Maybe not the best but definitely better then quick resume. I feel quick resume is better suited for people who can't settle down on 1 to 2 games at a time.",

So at this moment its a hassle to get video tutorials done where you could just plug a mike in and record audio over your game play...\n\nNow the only options you have is to either use a screen capture card with a mike and then a laptop with OBS and do screen capture that way with the mike audio. (in my case my pc in another room so I need to invest in  2x 60 feet HDMI cables and 1x 60 foot Mike cable to make my capture card work)\n\nOR   \n\nA standalone screen capture card with its own screen that you can record on directly and put a mike in that and it will record video from xbox and then audio from your mike.\n\nOR\n\nYou must use the remote play feature and connect to your PC with the xbox pc app and then use the windows Game Bar app to screen record and use the mike input on pc for voice over. ( This is how Windows suggest you do it- kinda defeat the purpose of having a console then if I'm going to sit in front of the pc the whole time) \n\nMAYBE\n\nStream directly to twitch and try to get audio that way but then again Xbox does not support audio from the webcam  and also not even from the 4 official webcams they suggest you use.\n\nGiven all this hassle I still love my Series X",

Anybody telling you the PS5 is quiet have never used a series x. Even at my desk 2 feet from it I just can't hear it at all. I can definitely hear my PS5 in demanding games. When you pick up the series x it immediately feels so premium. The PS5 is a great console but the hardware engineering isn't even close to the series x. My first console was an Xbox and my library is primarily on Xbox but I have started getting new multiplatform games on PS5. I just don't trust Microsoft to turn it around at this point.",
