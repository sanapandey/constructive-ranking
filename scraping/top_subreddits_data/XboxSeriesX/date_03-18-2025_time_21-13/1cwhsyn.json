It is the first game that allows blind people to race cars around the track, but unfortunately the game itself is by far the worst entry Turn 10 has released in all of its history. Don't get me wrong, it is a decent game, but it is nowhere close to the quality that is expected from a first party studio that, honestly, had not released a lackluster entry until now.",
