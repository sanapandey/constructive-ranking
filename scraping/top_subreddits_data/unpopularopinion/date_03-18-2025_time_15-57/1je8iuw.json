For whatever reason there is a particular brand of people who are not paying attention and just go when they think they should go probably to save 3 second off their commute. My last experience I was cycling and had the right of way and a car didn\u2019t even attempt to stop I had to swerve on my bike just to avoid them and they would have hit me. Karma was with me that day as a cop saw the whole thing and gave them a ticket. I\u2019ve also been hit twice by cars while walking on my right of way! If you can\u2019t respect the rules of the road you shouldn\u2019t be driving! It\u2019s a danger to you everyone else driving and your surroundings. Please respect right of way. Please be aware that that person walking during your turn signal is literally allowed to be walking and is supposed to go first. I\u2019ve seen so many people that don\u2019t even stop.",

A lot of drivers are just dumb or not paying attention.

No, that tiny little piss excuse of a \"\"crumple zone\"\" does not count. ACTUAL crumple zones need to be mandatory for all cars on the road.

She laughed at me & said \"What do you know? You don't even drive cars!\"  Hmm.  I replied, \"No, I don't drive cars, but I do ride motorcycles.\" I was genuinely afraid as a passenger in her car. Fast forward a few years and Oh, Look, she's killed a man. A motorcyclist. She hit him head on, as she was driving on the wrong side of the road early one morning. The absolute joke of it is, that at court all she got was done for CARELESS driving - a 300 pound fine and a 3 year driving ban. That was IT. She has her licence back now & her life goes on.\n\n Meanwhile, a 37 year old husband & father of two young children lies dead due to her dangerous driving, I wonder what their lives are like?\n\nDefinitely too soft on dangerous drivers and there are LOADS of them - I'd say it's the majority (in England, at least - I've minimal experience of other countries roads). It seems to me that people pass their test & get slack, develop dangerous driving habits, become complacent and entitled.

They can get double fucked.\n\nPedestrians on the other hand, I agree with you. With the exception of people crossing where there isn\u2019t a crosswalk or walking against the signal.

They had a lot of danger to driving IMO.  But I think that there needs to be laws that apply to behavior in roads including pedestrian cyclists etc. Nobody and I mean nobody who is moving or in the road (other than passengers) should be reading anything or having cell phone conversations.  The number of clowns I see entering intersections without looking or looking while they're walking is ridiculous. If we can train you with it at age two and three and four, you should f****** well know how to safely behave in your 20s 30s 40s and 50s.  You might get killed her more likely you're going to cause an accident it's going to cause damage and injury and potentially death to other people because of your callous behavior.",

This was nowhere near the first time that's happened. It's also incredibly common for drivers to make left turns and nearly take me out while I'm going straight, particularly in cases when we're both stopped at a red light and it turns green for both of us at the same time. My personal favorite is when I'm riding in a bike lane and a car cuts around me to park in the lane, which is illegal locally.",

Maybe you ought to plan ahead and cross the road away from the junctions instead of charging in front of cars coming around corners and simply hoping they'll a) notice and b) react in time to save your life from your destiny.\n\nThankfully the law is on the side of the pedestrian and 99% of drivers go well out of their way to avoid killing the idiots trying to committ suicide but that's not something I would rely upon while walking about or cycling.",

To ride a bike you just need to buy a bike there should be something in place for the people who dont drive to get \"experience\" and educated on what to do etc. \n\nNow thats not me saying things like running red lights is because they dont know, thats just disingenuous lol but theres a lot that could be helped with it.",
