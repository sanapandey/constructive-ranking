It sends the message that more seen=automatically better.\n\nJoe Russo getting annoyed by blockbusters not winning is the prime example. Just because a movie is popular, does not mean it's good. ",

            "body": "A similar thing is happening in gaming right now. Some AAA Game studios are still crushing it (Looking at Nintendo, Atlus and Fromsoft for examples but there are obviously plenty) but meanwhile, in many sectors indie games like Balatro, Another Crabs Treasure and Vampire Survivors are passing them either in sales or in word-of-mouth-praise, while massive studio games that were incredibly overhyped (Starfield comes to mind) were either okay according to the diehard Bethesda fans or just a straight up shitshow according to the vast majority of those who played it after it couldn't have been more hyped up for years (without trailers even showing gameplay until right before and yes, this should clearly have been the first of many red flags for this game!)\n\nThe true gamer who wants to benefit from this as much as possible knows that the key to gaming today is having both some indie games and some AAA games (from trusted studios with good track records) in your gaming library to enjoy the best of both worlds\n\nAnora and The Substance were also good. I've not seen Dune 2 or Wicked but I also did not want to based on the trailer for either so maybe AAA studios shouldn't rely on people seeing their productions just because they used to be more dominating in the field. Competition can be a very good thing",
