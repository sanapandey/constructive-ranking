They would be amongst the worst groups of people to take advice from, even if they didn't have the sort of platform they do.",

And I think more humility and understanding that really were often as clueless and uninformed or missing just as much information as the person we think is clueless. We're both just too clueless to realise it and we have to be by definition. If we realised how clueless we were we wouldn't be arguing in the first place we'd be doing more research\u00a0",
