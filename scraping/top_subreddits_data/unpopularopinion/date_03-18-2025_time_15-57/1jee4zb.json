    "selftext": "Seriously, how does anyone enjoy drinking coors lite or whatever? I drink alcohol all the time and I honestly think there needs to be some bite to make it palatable. I don't drink Natty Ice but I always thought it tasted at least a little less disgusting than lite beer even though everyone claims it's bottom barrel, because at 5.6 percent alcohol or whatever it's not just pure poss water like Miller lite or colors lite. Plus besides the fact that it tastes terrible, drinking a 6 pack of Miller lite (4.2 percent) is the equivalent of 5 units of alcohol. Apparently it's about cost, but you can get a decent tallboi Imperial IPA that actually tastes good that is 3 units of alcohol for around 2 for $5-9, how much more alcohol do you truly need to drink than that? Next you're gonna tell me the $60 gram of trash blow cut with draino is worth it over  the $80 solid chunk of 70% pure because you're saving 33%.",

They are generally something that you can consume numerous of without getting sick of the taste or getting way too wasted.  The other reason is low calories.\n\nMy personal favorite is an IPA called Slightly Mighty by Dogfish.",

My favorite local craft light beer (Aluminum Cowboy by Hop & Sting) has 110 calories and 5 carbs per 12 oz can. For that same 12 oz I could drink Coca-Cola which is 140 calories but 39 grams of carbs, which is all from high fructose corn syrup (processed sugar). If I drink 2 of either per day, Aluminum Cowboy saves 420\ncalories and 490 grams of carbs over the course of a week, and that takes essentially no willpower since the beer is tastier anyway.\n\nEven if I use a non-light beer (but nothing unusually heavy), another local favorite (Altstadt's helles lager) is 150 calories and 12 grams of carbs. 2 per day now sees an increase of 140 calories but still decreases carb intake by 378 grams.\n\nThis is very valuable because America puts processed sugar in all sorts of places that it doesn't belong (e.g. Subway's bread has too much sugar to legally be called bread in Europe) so reducing this as much as possible is very helpful.",

My favorite domestic non-ipa beer is Yuengling which isn\u2019t \u201clight\u201d but falls in line with Miller lite and Coors lite. I\u2019m also from PA so it\u2019s a popular drink there.\n\nThe first miller lite (my go to \u201clite\u201d beer) I feel kinda iffy about but halfway through my second one they start to go down like water until I drink 5-6 of them. \n\nIPAs are usually double the price. I buy 24 packs of miller lite at Sam\u2019s club for just under $20. A 6 pack of pernicious (NC IPA and my favorite) is close to $10 at Wal-mart. \n\nIf I\u2019m at a brewery or a bar I\u2019ll get craft beer if available. At home I\u2019ll switch between Yuengling or Miller Lite. Coors lite is fine too it just has less of a beer flavor.",

Baskets of curly fries, cheeseburgers, cheese fries, nachos, bratwursts, onion rings\u2026 Not exactly a low-calorie menu. I believe a lot of people who don\u2019t actually like beer will drink light beers because they have less beer flavor. They couldn\u2019t care less about the calories.\n\nFull disclosure, I worked with the Anheuser-Busch brewery as a vendor and consultant off and on for roughly 30 years. When I met my wife, she too was working for the brewery. A-B does not make any of their traditional brands flavorful enough for me, and when I find myself in a location where all that is served are Michelob, Bud, Bud Light, etc., I will just abstain. Same for my wife, who has traveled all over Europe and knows how good beer can be in countries like Belgium and Germany. Typical American beers are not worth the calories, even if the calories are somewhat reduced.",

I don't judge anyone for drinking a light beer, what beer someone drinks doesn't determine their quality as a person in any way, shape, or form, but I just hate the taste of light beers. I've tried plenty before, but I've never liked the taste. Take Bud Light, for instance. I can't understand why people would willingly drink it if they have other options available. But if they do, more power to them. They can drink what they like, and I'll drink what I like.",
