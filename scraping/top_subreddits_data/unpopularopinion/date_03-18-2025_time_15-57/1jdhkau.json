    "selftext": "I genuinely dislike the feeling of receiving a hickey. It's similar to the discomfort of hearing nails on a chalkboard or biting into aluminum foil\u2014an intense, cringe-inducing sensation rather than a pleasant one. My wife sometimes tries to flirt by playfully giving me a hickey on my shoulder or back, and my reaction is always immediate discomfort.\n\nUnfortunately, when I visibly or verbally react negatively, it's often interpreted as rejecting flirtation or affection. I get that many people find hickeys fun or playful, but for me, it's an unpleasant sensation I can't control. It feels like this isn't widely accepted or understood, so I end up seeming like I'm shutting down intimacy.",

Marks can generally be covered or displayed as appropriate for the social environment afterwards, it's just a small bruise. Fingernail raking on the back, and other parts of bodies, can feel  similarly good in the moment,  but with broken skin and imperfect fingernail cleaning is more likely to cause infection, and irritation against clothing. \n\nHowever, the thing that struck me about OP's account is how negatively he feels about them and that his wife does it anyway. Which doesn't seem ideal, especially if she's trying to shame him into acceptance by saying his visceral reaction is spoiling the mood. It does underline the importance of communication and consent in any relationship; limits should still be respected even if you don't feel the same way.",
