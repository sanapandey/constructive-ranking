    "selftext": "Out of all the ways someone can get a soda drinking it from the can is the worst form. \n\nNot only do fountain and bottled soda taste way more fresh and better. When soda comes in a can it has this aluminum taste that comes with it because it sits in a can generally doesn\u2019t taste as fresh and is also the most inconvenient way to drink soda. \n\nFountain soda at least has a lid that covers it from spilling if you\u2019re driving in your car. Bottled soda is better because of its reseal purposes. When someone opens a can of soda you have to drink it right then and there and it generally doesn\u2019t hold its fizz for a long time. \n\nA bottled soda you can almost nurse it the full day. Fountain soda trumps because it\u2019s the most fresh tasting and it doesn\u2019t come with the nasty aluminum flavor that comes when you drink it out of a can. \n\nAlso sometimes the can portion sizes suck. I love soda. I don\u2019t wanna haul around 2 cans it\u2019s a lot more work than just carrying around one bigger cup or a bigger bottle. \n\nSoda in the can is its worst form. ",
