    "selftext": "I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m sitting with my friends/partner/family when I fly. In fact, I sometimes prefer to be alone so I can sleep or read and make the flight go faster.\n\nSeems like most people are willing to pay extra to sit with their travel partner, or even bother someone who paid for a seat to see if they\u2019ll move and accommodate their preferred seating arrangement. I simply don\u2019t care that much, and have even had people in my life a bit upset when I\u2019m not willing to pay an extra $50 for that window seat next to them.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019m a particularly cheap flyer, I never check bags and will sit in the cheapest/smallest seat despite having long legs and sometimes ending up folded in the back of a plane. Also, when I don\u2019t pay for adjacent seats (and the booking system screams at me that I might not be placed next to my travel partner), we often end up together anyways.\n\nThe counter argument is in a deadly plane crash I\u2019d pay anything to spend my last moments with the people I love, sure. Guess I\u2019m just banking on that not happening!\n\nAnd lastly I\u2019ll preempt this comment: if/when I have children, I\u2019ll pay to sit with them for as long as they want to sit with me on flights.
