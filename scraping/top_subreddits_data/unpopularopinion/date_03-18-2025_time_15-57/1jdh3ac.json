But I don\u2019t get any extra enjoyment out of going to Home Depot to buy deck screws and I certainly don\u2019t think shopping at Costco is fun. People treat it like it\u2019s the next shopping experience ever, and they praise the Kirkland brand and the cafe that is not good (nor bad to be fair). I want to be in and out as fast as I can and I only get a few things ",

Plus, I had twice the amount of food with Costco which meant I didn't have to go to the store for like three weeks after shopping at Costco when I ran out of food after one week with foods from Publix. \n\nGranted... I don't need EVERYTHING in bulk though. Fruits and bread, for example, will spoil if I get too much at a time. But it's definitely worth going through the shopping nightmare of threading through a million people that is Costco for the savings.",

Not saying I don\u2019t pay attention to prices and just buy whatever I try and stay under a certain amount but I don\u2019t have a budget to stick to which makes it easier. I just dislike having to grab the other things other than food like paper towels, medicine, hair care etc\u2026 basically anything unrelated to food. I\u2019ve just always loved food and just shopping for my partner and I is quite easy. Now when I have kids I\u2019ll probably feel differently about grocery shopping but for now it\u2019s not an annoying experience for me",

The Kirkland brand means that Costco went straight to the manufacturer, assessed their quality, and if the brand name's quality is found lacking Costco holds the manufacturer to a higher standard.

The whole idea is that by having the highest quality goods and selling them at massive volume for a low margin, customers are willing to spend more because they never think \"Well Kirkland brand Tide looks good, but I should see if I can get it cheaper at Target/Walmart\".",

This is exactly the service Costco provides.\n\nAs for the Kirkland brand, it's good quality stuff.  Like any store, you have to compare prices though, Costco and even the Kirkland brand, isn't always the best deal.  It's definitely not something to sing praises for, but it's better than most store-brand products.\n\nThe reason the cafeteria is hyped is because it's CHEAP.  If I take 3 people with me I can feed all of us for $6.36 with sales tax. That's less than the cost of one person at any fast food joint these days.  And Kirkland's hotdogs are actually really good, on par with any premium brand from the regular grocery store.

The below podcast is very long but it's comprehensive in it's history and what sets it a part. \n\n  \n[https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/costco](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/costco)\n\nSome highlights: \n\n* Everyone knows Costco can bring down prices by buying in bulk but something not discussed is how Costco has a strategy of offering a limited number of items. Costco has about 3000 SKUs at a given time compared to Walmart which offers around 12000. Limited competition gives them an edge in negotiating literally no other store can compete with.\n* Along with limited SKUs they also are able to negotiate many unique offerings with brands. For example, at Costco you could find electric toothbrush heads for less than you can anywhere else but that item most likely is a 5 pack compared to a 3 pack or some other competitive advantage.\n* The Kirkland brand is not some random collection of items. They are specifically targeted as products Costco has determined they can take on to improve and pass savings to customers. Kirkland olive oil, almonds, chicken, and wine are all examples of highly successful variations. Not only are cost effective but better in quality then it's competitors.\n\n  \nAll that being said the below line shows you're just at the wrong store. I don't stop at a roadside vegetable stand and get annoyed when they don't have 10 different choices of apples.\n\n>I want to be in and out as fast as I can and I only get a few things",

And it\u2019s just a big ass mess. People not paying attention, people getting irritated \u2014 if you go to self check, each one is the standard 4 registers, 2 across from another pair but people always split in two lines, so I\u2019ve seen people before wait for the two registers on their \u201cline\u201d to be clear, even if the two registers in the other \u201cline\u201d clear up faster, meaning one individual is holding up their line, when they could have just gone to the register that emptied on the \u201cother side\u201d \u2014 *but*, I get why they don\u2019t because if you do, now you \u201ccut\u201d someone all because no one is saying \u201chey, self check-out is one line for four registers - don\u2019t make a line associated to each pair of registers\u201d \n\nAll this from 3:30-6:30 is enough to sour any enjoyment I\u2019d be able to get from there lol",

Super inconvenient to get to, and the \"feel\" there was so... combative and depressing.  Like going to Filene's Basement during a holiday sale.  Everyone impatient, everyone pushy, everyone a hair's breadth from a parking lot fight over a space.\n\nWhen my sister moved from NYC to the outer Atlanta suburbs, it seemed like every day I talked to her, she was at Costco.  She'd go there for like one or two items, like it was just another supermarket.  She was always chatting with the food sample people, some of whom she knew by name. I live here now, the Costco is 10 minutes away, and always a nice experience.  In my 15 years here, I've never had that ick feeling of the Costcos up north. I truly enjoy it each time, even on weekends when it's a mob scene... because it's a southern mob, and the whole mood is just more polite and low-stress.  People aren't angry, competitive and aggressive by default here, the way they are in the tri-state area, so there's no \"worst\" in people for Costco to bring out.

What were you thinking?! You even realise why it's likely to not be a great place to go shopping yet still managed to come away disappointed?! That's just I mean I didn't know people worked that way.\n\n\nIf I went in and found they didn't have much to offer me I'd be like yup, as I thought, a waste of time, not for me\n\n\nIt takes a weird mental twist to leave that feeling disappointed when you knew it was a pretty stupid idea in the first place. It's like going to a swimming pool to practice origami and then saying I know it's not quite aimed at me but I thought I'd give it a go.\n\n\nLike what is your mindset going in to leave disappointed and not, that was a stupid idea from the start and my expectations were wrong\u00a0",

It for sure has a real savings.   \n\nThe food court is gross.  The savings at Costco is really not great anymore.  They do a great job at getting people to spend $300 or more per cart. \n\nPeople will make some argument about how they save .60 cents a gallon.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to wait in line to go in and show a stupid card.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to wait in line to show a stupid receipt to leave. \n\nI don\u2019t want to wait in line forever to save .60 cents a gallon.   \n\nThe whole thing is a stupid crowded shopping experience.   If you got time, extra money and don\u2019t mind being around herds of people enjoy yourself and the membership.",

Get the hotdog, get a big carton of eggs, smoothie fruit, protein bars, Chobani yogurts, butter lettuce, romaine, strawberries, blueberries, frozen quiches, frozen vacuum-packed fish,, batteries, etc. It's wonderful. Their buyers ensure everything they carry is decent, so you can't go wrong on a bottle of wine.",
