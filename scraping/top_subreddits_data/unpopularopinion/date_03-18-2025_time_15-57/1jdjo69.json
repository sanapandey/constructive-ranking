    "selftext": "Being lazy is highly unnatural for a human being and contradictory to the survival of the species.\n\nPeople who seem to be lazy have undiscovered physical or neurological health issues giving them less energy and drive.\n\nAlso to share my personal anectdote:  \nWhen I was a 6 years old I was mumbling very strong and was hard to understand. The pediatrician said nothing is wrong with me and I'm just \"speech lazy\". Like too lazy to speak clearly and it's no issue if I want to. I must add I was also pretty lazy in general but never wanted to be lazy.\n\nOver 20 years later I found out I had a disease which made me so tired I had to use all my energy and focus to use my mouth to speak.\n\nNow my speech is better, I'm not lazy anymore and never was to begin with.\n\n  \nUPDATE:  \nGuys thanks for your input. It's been highly entertaining.  \n  \nTo people who are interested in what disease I have:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1jcyisf/do\\_dust\\_mite\\_allergy\\_immunotherapy\\_at\\_all\\_cost/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1jcyisf/do_dust_mite_allergy_immunotherapy_at_all_cost/)",

Tax forms suck because we're aware why they do, they basically take money away from us more or less. Preparing a meal (and sharpening a tool) on the other hand is seen as a necessity.
