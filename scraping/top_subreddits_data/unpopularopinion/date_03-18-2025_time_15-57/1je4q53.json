I don't know the numbers but I'm sure a head of shredded lettuce goes WAY further than a head unshredded. from a cost perspective for restaurants it makes sense, but I don't have to like it.",

It can soak up flavors much better than big leaves do, which makes it perfect for when you need the lettuce to hold onto other yummy ingredients. Plus, it's super easy to eat with chopsticks! I guess this makes it more practical for some dishes where the lettuce isn't just a side but part of the main flavor experience",
