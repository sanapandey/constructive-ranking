    "selftext": "I truly believe a lot of people do things for attention more than they realize, especially in the case of social media. I mean social media is literally made to show other people something, i would absolutely not believe someone who is posting their cars, their jewlerys, their body on social media is solely doing it for themselves.\n\nI mean I get it though, like posting your body or flexing ur watches do make you feel better about yourself and build up confidence, but isnt a major part of it because you know that some people will admire what you are showing is that which makes you feel better about yourself?\n\nThis is not the case for EVERYTHING but i would say this is the case for a majority of the reason why we do a lot of things, from the way we dress to the things we post on social media. Sometimes this can be vain, materialistic and trashy, sometimes its completely fine to want a little bit of validation.",

While showing off achievements or what we own can boost confidence and self-esteem, there's no denying that part of the reason we do it is to get others to notice these aspects of ourselves. Finding a balance is key, while some appreciation from others can be really gratifying, it shouldn't overshadow the intrinsic value we place on our actions and choices... you know? It's like walking a tightrope between wanting people to see your cool new car and just enjoying driving it yourself",

I'm kind of scared of attention. I'd rather you pay attention to someone else, lol. It's too much pressure to be a person, and getting attention can make people jealous which is annoying. \n\nSocial media exists for social reasons. If you don't want attention, you probably wouldn't post almost anything. It's designed for people to respond when you post- it's an attention machine. \n\nEven antisocial me does certain things to manage the gaze of the other. I dress to blend in so I seem more normal & look like someone you could give a job to. \n\nWe live in a society, as they say. We are a social species and we are often signifying things to each other even less consciously. \n\nI won't say everyone loves or wants attention, but if you don't, you're some flavor of neurodivergent, like schizoid or something. Not wanting attention genuinely isn't normal, but it is a normal variation of human.",
