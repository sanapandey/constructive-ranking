We have had scant little proof that the current screening methods are having any specific impact. I just keep hearing \"Well, they must be working because nothing bad has happened.\"\n\nEdit: Wow, this blew up fast. I want to commend everyone for having a relatively civil discussion in the comments. Thanks! \n\nEdit 2: Some of you don't seem to understand that correlation is not causation. Just because we have had no incidents of terrorism does not mean that TSA regulations are the cause. The fact that we are not hearing proof of causation from TSA heavily leads to believing it's not there.",

It\u2019s literally how terrorism & mass casualty events are executed. Someone detects a security loophole or poorly protected soft target AND assess the intelligence of the people responsible for challenging your attempted breach. Find something that skirts the letter of the law but when presented to an agent without the reasoning skills to recognize that it violates the intent of the law and your breach will be successful. Further aggravating this are situations where those responsible for ensuring safety arrogantly feel that they know everything and ironically disengage analyzing the information before them. So many of our modern day catastrophes, attacks & major crimes have an arrogant failure to process all the facts & data.\n\nThe janitor you hire doesn\u2019t have to hold a Ph.D. to do his job\u2026.but he *does* need to know not to mix bleach & ammonia and WHY\u2026bonus if he knows that other products that we don\u2019t think as having those ingredients actually do & are dangerous if you don\u2019t know that (.i.e. glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner).\n\nP.S.

The TSA checkpoints weren't designed in a vacuum, so to take them out of context and judge the entirety of the airport security apparatus based on one metric that is in no way holistic even in judging that single layer is weak af. Even if the TSA checkpoint was the ONLY security, and it fails to catch weapons 70% of the time, your argument still doesn't work. Your argument is logically invalid (arguing that the \"TSA is not deterring anyone\"). Most people don't get busted driving drunk, but the presence of penalties and law enforcement, nevertheless, dissuades a shitload of people from trying it, right? \n\nAs for proving that airport security dissuades people, if you think about that demand for just a second, you'd realize that it's totally unprovable. It's a stupid thing to ask for. How do I measure how many people stay home instead of trying to take over a plane with a box cutter? I can't, nevertheless, anyone that is having the argument in good faith will acknowledge that the harder you make something, the more likely it is that people will avoid trying. Perhaps the difficulty for terries isn't enough to justify the inconvenience to people ... that's a fair argument to have, but to deny it does _anything_ is unreasonable.\n\n> You and I clearly have fundamental differences in philosophy about rights and the law if your take is that judges infallibly define whether rights are being violated. Not worth the argument.\n\nNo, I think we have fundamental differences on what it means to have a discussion in good faith. You can't seem to grant any grace here, and that's apparent by you taking what I say and wildly exaggerating it. I never argued the courts are infallible, I said that you don't determine what is or isn't constitutional. The courts do that (and yes, sometimes they get it wrong, and sometimes they change their minds), and in this case they have very specifically ruled. I point that out not to stifle the argument, but to strengthen mine. You say it's a violation of the 4th amendment, but the professionals that our society has put in place to make those determinations have spoken specifically on it and made their argument public and appealable. You have made a bald assertion. Which is stronger given your previous comment to me? \n\nThe courts say that a consensual search is not a violation of the 4th amendment. You're free to disagree and argue it if you want, but I'd suggest you at least read the ruling I linked first to see how many of your arguments the trained and experienced professionals anticipated and addressed.",

Meaningless or Contradictory Directives\n\n\u2022 POW Camps: Prisoners were forced to follow nonsensical or contradictory orders (e.g., moving rocks back and forth, reciting false confessions, or performing pointless physical tasks). The goal was to mentally exhaust them and enforce obedience through confusion.\n\n\u2022 COVID-19 Restrictions: Many government-imposed rules seemed illogical or contradictory, such as:\n\n\u2022 Masks required while walking to a restaurant table, but not when sitting.\n\n\u2022 Big-box stores like Walmart staying open, while small businesses were forced to close.\n\n\u2022 Schools closed, yet daycare centers remained open.\n\n\u2022 Some countries required outdoor masking, despite limited evidence of outdoor transmission.\n\n\n\nBoth cases show the use of arbitrary rules that defied logic, leaving people feeling powerless and questioning the legitimacy of authority.\n\n\n\n2. Learned Helplessness & Compliance Training\n\n\u2022 POWs: The goal of these tactics was to break resistance, making prisoners accept any directive without question, even when it made no sense.\n\n\u2022 COVID-19 Public Response: The ever-changing rules led many to:\n\n\u2022 Comply out of exhaustion, rather than agreement.\n\n\u2022 Lose trust in the reasoning behind mandates.\n\n\u2022 Follow rules that felt like rituals, rather than effective health measures.\n\n\n\nThis created a divide\u2014some followed all orders without question, while others resisted the perceived absurdity.\n\n\n\n3. Isolation & Social Control\n\n\u2022 POWs: Isolation was used to break prisoners mentally. They were cut off from others, making them easier to control and less likely to resist.\n\n\u2022 COVID-19 Lockdowns: Prolonged isolation led to:\n\n\u2022 Depression, anxiety, and increased suicide rates.\n\n\u2022 The loss of normal social interactions, which made people more dependent on government/media for guidance.\n\n\u2022 The encouragement of public shaming and reporting non-compliant individuals, creating divisions within society.\n\n\n\nBoth scenarios relied on isolation as a tool of control.\n\n\n4. Justification of Extreme Measures\n\n\u2022 POWs: Torture was often justified as being for the prisoner\u2019s own good (e.g., \u201cre-education\u201d in communist camps).\n\n\u2022 COVID-19: Harsh restrictions were justified as being for the greater good, even when they lacked scientific backing.",

And they have been proven to be largely ineffectual at it.  The ONLY purpose of deterrents is to stop crime as a lark, and minor infractions that are nearly 100% victimless like taking a gram of weed with you on vacation.\n\nIn your example.  If I want to go through your fence, I will wear black, a mask and bring a set off bolt cutters.  Its not a deterrent if I want on the other side, its just an obstacle to overcome. Its transparent, its obvious, and its fairly easy to undermine, just like TSA.  \n\nThe REAL deterrent is the consequences, not the barriers.  If you don't care about the repercussions of committing capital crimes, I don't think TSA is gonna be high on your \"reasons I'm not gonna do this\".  You have crossed a threshold.  This is why the idea is preposterous.  In this scenario, TSA is not a deterrent.  Its an inconvenience at worst.  \n\nThe reality is TSA IS security theater, but its only theater for the passengers to feel more safe.  Its not actually effective at its job, nor is it a deterrent to criminals.  Its just there to make your life more difficult, and force you to engage with security so you feel that the area, and by extension the plane, is secure.  It discourages you from petty crime that is likely to not matter, like minor drug trafficking, but it does nothing to stop catastrophic events.  Its a giant waste of money, and its a huge headache that we don't need.  We got by just fine for decades.",

In investigations by DHS the TSA failed to find weapons on investigators 95% of the time.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/investigation-breaches-us-airports-allowed-weapons-through-n367851](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/investigation-breaches-us-airports-allowed-weapons-through-n367851)\n\nTSA officers have been caught hundreds of times (out of thousands of suspected incidents) stealing screened items from passengers. In one famous case a TSA officer stole an iPad from an ABC journalist at Orlando Airport. Tracking software located the iPad at the home of TSA officer Andy Ramirez.\n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/abc-news-tracks-missing-ipad-florida-home-tsa/story?id=17331937](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/abc-news-tracks-missing-ipad-florida-home-tsa/story?id=17331937)\n\nThe TSA has become a federal jobs program for people with no higher education and low job skills. Maintaining security of air travel is an important job that needs to be done, but the TSA is astoundingly bad at it, and thoroughly corrupt. In an episode of \"Adam Ruins Everything\", host Adam Conover described the TSA as \"security theater\", meant only to make people feel more secure without actually making anything more secure.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LDzOi1dyAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LDzOi1dyAA)",

There are fewer of them than prior to 9/11, but that trend began in 1973 when the FAA required screening of passengers and carry-on luggage.\n\n2001 was actually a low year in terms of the number of hijackings, with only 11. Four of those were the 9/11 attacks, so even though the number of hijackings had decreased, the number of deaths from hijackings was dramatically higher than prior years. Prior to that, hijackings were seen as mostly an inconvenience. Simply reducing their numbers was a lot easier and less expensive than trying to eliminate them completely. 9/11 changed that.\n\nEven in 2001, there weren't a lot of hijackings left to eliminate. Still, they have been reduced by 60% to 70% per year since then. The single most effective action was an order by the FAA that all cockpit doors be bulletproof and reinforced, that the doors remain locked during flight, and that the flight crew does not comply with hijacker demands. Even if someone managed to get a weapon on board the flight, and many do, they won't be able to take control of the aircraft. It's not because they x-ray your shoes and stop you from bringing bottled water onto the plane. Those actions are meant to placate passengers into believing they are safer, rather than actually making them safer.\n\nMost weapons seizures at TSA checkpoints are not the result of an actual attempt by a passenger to smuggle a weapon on board an aircraft. They are the result of passengers either not knowing they weren't allowed to bring the weapon into the secure area, or forgetting that they were carrying the weapon. The passengers were not making any real effort to hide the weapons, so TSA found them fairly easily. The DHS investigations in my first link found that a passenger who was really intent on getting a weapon onto a plane would be successful in getting that weapon past TSA about 95% of the time.",

My bag was then promptly sent to secondary inspection, where, around ten feet away from that agent, a second agent yelled at me for not taking out any electronics, demanding to know why I couldn't follow basic instructions.  Saying that I had just been told it was a precheck line and not to remove electronics, and asking him to ask the first agent, of course, just resulted in more shouting at me, rather than, say, asking the person who was, as I was being screamed at, still telling people not to remove electronics.",

Part of that job involves signing up for pretty much everyone federal and state PR department's email list. Doing so gives you an easy source for potentially interesting stories and gives you easy access to PR contact info. One agency I signed up for was the TSA.\n\nEvery week, they sent out an email listing everything the confiscated in the last week. It was almost always keychains, pocket knives, nail clippers, and on a big week, maybe a pair of scissors. It all had the energy of \"look at how much work we're doing! Please keep funding us!\"\n\nI assure you, if a legitimate hijacking or bombing was averted by the TSA, it would have been screamed to the high heavens.\n\nTSA is a slight deterrent that MIGHT catch your low-level, dumb as a brick, alienated, lone-wolf type guy. They never have, but in theory, they might.\n\nIf someone is sufficiently motivated, they can outfox the TSA.\n\nThe TSA does two things: makes Joe customer feel safe enough to travel by plane in order to prop up our air travel industry, and serve as a jobs program dressed up as national security.",

I may regret even sharing this, but you can sign up for it while you're checking your baggage in and skip the ENTIRE LINE. 50% of the time, you just skip security entirely. It's as easy to getting on the waitlist for dinner at PF Changs. \n\nBut in general SeaTac is terrible. The TSA checkpoint seems to be staffed by the slowest human beings imaginable. I went through with a mirrorless camera, a couple magic the gathering decks, and just general carry-on nonsense and it was an actual ordeal. Like, the lady operating the Xray seemed to be genuinely baffled and confused by what she saw. It took more than a moment to show her \"This is a camera\" and \"These are pieces of cardboard\". \n\nAnd of course, the whole thing looks like they never advanced their logistics beyond Sept of 2001, because it dumps you  right into this busiest goddamn throughfare in the area. It'd be like if pit lane exit at a F1 race dumped you right into the fast straight with a blind exit. It's one of the dumbest civil design features in modern america.\n\nOn the flipside, I feel like last time I flew out of Asheville, NC....they TSA person (not people...person) was like \"Oh shit, you should have packed a gun with your fishing rod. I hate that dude over at gate 4\"",

When I said STL didn't require it so I didn't think about it they said they don't care about *other* airport rules I have to follow *this* airport's rules. They didn't respond very nicely when I said that's confusing then and  no need to get on my case about it. Since then I make a point of looking at the instructions at each airport and they definitely can vary by airport and by who is working that day. So, yeah... that's fun for travelers.",

He assembled it and put it under the seat with the flotation device stuff, then got off the flight on a layover.

Otherwise, I can say the cockpit door being consistently locked properly is what prevented all the incidents that didn't happen, and the TSA did nothing.\n\nProbably that argument is not true, but it's certainly interesting to know the answer as to how much each measure is contributing - we have evidence that locked cockpit doors have prevented hijackings, such as in Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554.",

That level of risk is tollerable at events centers and cruise ships, again because beyond from it being a place with lots of people, those are not controllable, high-speed, fuel-filled missles with hostages that can jeopardize other critical targets.\n\nNow, also thanks to a bunch of advancements in technology, progress is being made. More and more places have better 3D scanners for luggage that remove the need to remove electronics because they can see the items in question. The newest versions can, finally, see the required density properties to tell liquids like water apart from liquid explosives, so eventually that rule should change (it's far from everywhere yet so it's too soon). In the people lane, those new rotating or plate-based milimeter wave scanners let agents see where issues are rather than just beeps, reducing needs for close-up searches. Shoes are a little trickier so there are scanners just for that coming out (beyond the alternative individual investigation methods like precheck).\n\nCruise ship patdowns, when needed, are more looking for  on-person weapons and not those powderized or liquified agents, which beget cavity searches at airports sometimes. So, it's getting better. Doesn't mean there aren't lots of ways they could stop all the profiling for \"random\" searches or some other unnecessary things, but it isn't yet as easy as event security, again due to the unique threats in airline aviation.",

They require that you take your shoes off, open a liquids bag that MUST only fit a small amount of liquids, you WILL be asked to throw them away if you have too many.  Your electronics must be taken out, they ask you to keep your shoes on but I've been pulled out almost every time, palms wiped,  shoes and lower jeans hand checked, ponytail/hair checked (my hair is very fine). \n\nMy backpack is pulled 50% of the time I fly through Berlin as well. \n\nAnyways this long comment is to say that domestic travel in the US even with more checks is now a breeze IMO.  Sure you can mistime it but I've never waited more than 30 mins to get through any security system in the world to travel by plane.",

We were sent to a \"hotel\" to wait for the next flight in 24 hours. When we asked for food they gave us the number to a pizza place. We had exactly one dollar, which we used to buy a pack of gum so we could chew on something.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the morning we were served a piece of bread and a cup of tea. The lady serving us was Latina, we explained our situation to her (we're from Chile), she later came back with extra bread she snuck from the kitchen. She was the only person to treat us as humans during that whole ordeal.\u00a0\n\n\nI guess a teenage girl and her mom were a huge threat to America. This happened in Austin Texas, 2005.",

At best, they have made nebulous claims about how the mere existence of the TSA has prevented terrorists from doing anything at all with no way to actually disprove the statement. Instead, there have been documented instances of the TSA flat out failing to catch weapons that were planted as part of breach testing.\n2. The underlying complaint is that the TSA is an instance of ACTUAL government redundancy. The benefits it provides are vague and hard to actually prove while repeatedly failing necessary audits. So instead of having some kind of consequences for an agency that fails to actually justify it's existence or even explain where funding goes....the govt tries to gut and dismantle of the Dept of Education or the Social Security Administration.\n\nWould also like to add that numerous airplane related tragedies that have occurred in recent years were not something that the TSA would have been any help with. They were due to regulatory failures resulting in planes just straight up ripping apart in flight, or crashing due to a lack of funding resulting in control towers being understaffed and flight paths getting mixed together.",

And the only place I am finding an actual number provided is from The Heritage Foundation website, which is an immediate red flag in terms of the veracity of the information.\n\nSo the reality is that it's ambiguous on whether or not the TSA has tangibly made the US safer or prevented acts of terrorism. (But given that testing has been conducted with something like a 95% failure rate to catch concealed weapons by TSA agents, I would say that odds don't look great at the TSA being an effective security force.)",

So there are several factors into the security of planes. \nFinally, the one thing that tsa does is change things based on current events, this includes spending $billions to change equipment.

Like instead of an all new agency, the funding is shifted to the FAA who create a FAA-Security division or something that handles what the TSA did while having direct oversight of things rather than having to filter it through an entirely different department and agency.\n\nAnd you are right: having something from prior to the TSA's formation to compare it to would go a long way towards providing necessary context as to how bad that 95% failure rate on testing actually is. Having said that, 95% failure is still 95% failure which is really damn bad. Private security companies in the 90s having a 97% failure rate (random number and was not able to find a reference for comparable testing) doesn't suddenly mean the TSA is doing a good job, it means BOTH the TSA and private security did a shitty job.",

It\u2019s important to acknowledge however that I am very much biased both from having to gotten to \u201csee behind the curtain\u201d and by making a living from aviation security.\n\nOne issue that I don\u2019t ever see raised online is that many times, the people who can refute claims are bound by security clearances. Take for example the \u201cTSA fails 90% of tests\u201d talking point. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I can\u2019t tell you why I don\u2019t believe this number. As somebody who\u2019s familiar with how screening officers are tested and the data behind it, I strongly believe it\u2019s been misinterpreted in some way. Elaborating any more would reveal information about how screening officers are tested which is a huge no-no. \n\nLet me be clear though, change is still needed. Security agencies need to do a better job communicating with the general public about the \u201cwhy\u201d of security screening and work to eradicate the combative and punitive impressions that are given off during screening. More work needs to be done in simplifying SOP\u2019s and making them less ambiguous. A common complaint is that screening needs to be more standardized and reliable across the country. The root cause of this complaint is poor wording of SOP\u2019s. Many of the people writing them don\u2019t have experience working on a checkpoint which causes misunderstandings and conflicting interpretations.\n\nThere is proof out there that TSA works, it\u2019s just that it harder to find and being a taxpayer funded agency, failures drive more clicks. These were two incidents today (that have articles) about loaded firearms being caught at checkpoints:\n\n[Newark](https://patch.com/new-jersey/newarknj/amp/32254346/2-guns-seized-at-newark-airport-travelers-not-arrested-tsa)\n\n[Lehigh Valley](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/lehigh-county/palmerton-man-stopped-by-tsa-with-loaded-handgun-at-lehigh-valley-international-airport-abe-carbon-county/523-5faf049d-b36d-448d-8899-ef277ebc2c26)\n\nThe last intentional attempt to get a bomb onboard an aircraft was in 2023:\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/03/01/us/explosives-suitcase-flight-arrest",

Before 9/11 passengers knew their best chance to survive was to cooperate and obey hijackers, and after 9/11 they knew their best chance to survive was to attack hijackers immediately, as they did successfully in the Richard Reid shoe bomber incident.\n\nEverything else, including taking off shoes and restrictions on liquids and nail clippers, Schneier says are just fake security or \"security theater.\" Doing something visible may make people feel better, but there is no actual benefit to security, and the costs in time, energy, and money would be much lower if we ended these fake security measures. We've already ended the ban on nail clippers, and any time would be a good time for the US to join European airports in ending the rules for shoes and liquids.\n\nEdit to add: One factor that makes reforming the TSA more difficult is that they have a union, and the Republicans are constantly trying to bust the union and the Democrats are constantly trying to protect the union, and every attempt to reform the rules for travelers gets hijacked and stalled by the union debate, so nothing ever happens.",

Because as it stands despite the supreme courts bullshit ruling about it being non invasive and a pile of other crap, its hard to imaging a more invasive search. Just about the only thing they don't do is body cavity searches (AFAIK!, which is actually part of the reason the entire thing is just theater). The only time I get touched that way is when i'm in an airport or in bed with a sex partner.\n\nNever-mind the entire 'bribe the government to prefer you, then get randomly selected anyway' bullshit.\n\nMy uncle, a pilot for a top 5 major carrier, was one of the people carrying a gun for a while as part of his job. He would tell stories of TSA searching his luggage while he stood their pointing out to them he had both a gun, and was the pilot of the plane and so looking for nail clippers or whatever was just complete nonsense.\n\nAnyway, its one in a long list of proofs for how we don't actually live in a constitutional democracy if the government ignores the constitution when it suits them.  Its creeping authoritarianism, pre TSA, it was at least somewhat of a gray area because it could be argued it wasn't the government doing the actual searches. And it was just a metal detector turned down low enough to only go off on a pound of metal, but bit by bit its gotten to the point where the federal government was taking pictures of nude girls, and  grabbing (with the back of their hand of course!) peoples breasts, asses, and sexual areas.

Are you wanting to see proof that airport security (I use airport security rather than TSA, as TSA is just the US organisation that run it) is catching potential terrorists in the act? Or do you want proof that it is acting as a deterrent to potential/would be terrorists. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nThe thing about any type of security is that it's never just a \"one-and-done\" thing. To give it the best chance of success it has to be layered so that if one element fails, then there are other elements there to give an additional layer of protection. A with any type of security, some elements are designed to be a deterrent to potential threats, while some elements are designed to react to active threats. \n\nThe way I see it, airport security is there to act first and foremost as a deterrent. If there is a process in place that poses a risk to a potential terrorist that they'll get caught at the first hurdle, then of course they're going to think twice about trying to attempt it. \n\nI guess every facet of airport and aeroplane security (all the way from how drop off/pick up is handled through to the cockpit being locked to all outside parties) is designed to make it as difficult as possible for an individual or an organisation to successfully hijack or blow up a plane. The more layers you're required to circumvent>the more planning and resources you require>the higher the chance of failure. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n That being said, US airport security agents are by far the worst to deal with on a personal level.",

TSA does so much behind the scenes that the public never sees that truly makes everyone safe. We\u2019re not infallible and we do screw up, but the amount of knifes, guns, fireworks, etc that we do find is mind boggling.

I'm not saying Trump is doing this deliberately, but if it happens, it will be a huge advantage for him, just as it was for Bush, and we will probably get another round of even tighter and less sensible \"protections.\"",
