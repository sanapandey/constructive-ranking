This is just my opinion though, of course. I feel like a Pok\u00e9mon game structured like and with the amount of love they put into MH Stories 2 would be the perfect Pok\u00e9mon game lol. So if you like Pokemon but ever felt like the Pokemon training part was too surface level, then definitely try MH Stories 2.",

That's partly because I'm a collector and the amount of technically individual monsties you can collect is literally like 6x bigger than the amount of monsties in the game (look up mhst color change). But also the combat is way more interesting in 1 with more complex patterns, I actually feel like I'm in a fight instead of mechanically spamming the same countermove while hoping I've upgraded my weapon enough to kill the monster before it eventually oneshots me. You can turn the tables with even cruddy gear and no potions if you're observant and play your cards right.\n\n\nBattles are more fun to prepare for too, since you have a limited number of supplies while fighting, unlike in 2 where you literally have access to your entire inventory of like 200 ancient potions.\n\n\nPokemon is boring, play monster hunter stories",
