The name is basically a mix of the word \"Quiahuitl\", which means \"rain\" or \"storm\" in Nahuatl, and 'Ra,' inspired by the Ancient Egyptian sun god Ra, who\u2019s often shown as a bird. So, the name can been seen as \"Ra of the Rain\" or \"Ra of the Storm\" \n",

It takes place after Rise and Sunbreak, because Fabius is the Ace Lancer from MH4U, and it takes place very shortly before MHW, in Rise they say one of the monsters from World was 'recently discovered' so since Ace Lancer and Little Miss Smithy are canonically the same people, just older, this takes place after Sunbreak.\" \nSo i went, \"man, fuck it! LEGACY!\" so i made Momohime again, remade Azuki, and picked Daifuku. \nMy friends assure me that its a sin to change Poogie's name, but I call Poogie \"Dango\" in my head.",
