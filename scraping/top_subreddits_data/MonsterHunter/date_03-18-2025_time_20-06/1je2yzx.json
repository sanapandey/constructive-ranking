An exception to this is Nu Udra which is in a newly introduced classification. \n\n2) They have special abilities that can alter entire ecosystems such as weather changing and other environment altering abilities(which gravely impacts the ecosystem).\n\n3) They have very unique properties (like the Magala and Nergigante).\n\n4) Most Elder dragons are six-limbed creatures. \n\n5) Elder dragons are noted for being particulary more intelligent than the other monsters in the game. \n\nAkantor/Ukanlos doesnt even check these boxes. If anything, Akantor/Ukanlos doesnt even break through the first one on the list.\n\nNot to mention the game states that Akantor/Ukanlos have vestigial wings, the same wings found in Flying Wyverns. We dont call cetaceans a fish now just because they swim like one.\n\nSo no, it is not remotely close to being inconsistent like what you claimed it to be.",

In Freedom 2 there's some optional dialogue before beating Akantor the first time that states that the Guild believed it to be some type of elder dragon, but after more investigation the Guild confirms that it's actually a relative of Tigrex and therefore a flying wyvern.\n\nIn early taxonomic charts Akantor and Ukanlos were pretty close relatives of Tigrex, and while this is still *technically* the case, the recent charts have the two splitting from the family tree much earlier than any if the other flying wyverns.  Tigrex is still their closest living relative, but in the same sense that the hippo is the closest living relative to whales.",

True wyverns (Basarios, Gravios, Rathalos, etc) which are bypedal with atrophied upper limbs turned into strong wings, and Quadrupedal flying wyverns (Tigrex, Akantor, etc) which have atrophied flying capacity but stronger upper limbs.\n* Then you have Bird wyverns, which are Kut-ku, gypceros, etc. Which are more leaned towards birds, so they have different degrees of flying capacity.\n* And brute wyverns, which are Deviljho, Brachydios, etc which are more like theropod dinosaurs and completely flightless in every way.\n* Within Bird wyverns there is also a sub-genre called bird-theropod wyverns. They are flightless and relatively close to brute wyverns due to their body shape, but they are classified as bird wyverns because they live in social hierarchies (brute wyverns don't) and because they are way smaller than Brute Wyverns.\n\nAkantor and Ukanlos were made as Flying wyverns because at the time of their release the -hardest- monsters to beat were flying wyverns, other than Fatalis and Rajang. \n\nElder dragons were easier to beat in general and a with wider spectrum of difficulty, including Lao Shang which wouldn't even fight back. They also were hunted over multiple hunts, and carried damage over, which made them potentitally easier than other encounters; by making Akantor and Ukanlos flying wyverns they ensured you HAD to beat them in one fight.\n\nThis was also a bigger challenge because back then there was no item re-stocking during a hunt. Oh you ran out of sonic bombs? Too bad, you have to restart the hunt.\n\nAkantor was a bitch in this regard because it was a very very very long fight solo the first time you beat him. It wasn't hard in the damage department, but you could only carry 3 Cold Drinks and he was fought in the volcano area. This meant you had 10 minutes of cold drink three times, for a 50 minute hunt on an area that depleted your HP constantly if you did not had a cold drink... and if you were knocked out you would lose the effect.\n\nAlso, in those gens enraged monsters, and specially flying wyverns got a huge damage and speed boost. We are talking Rathalos getting a+150% speed boost. So, a flying wyvern would go from spending 1 sec to turn and 0.5 seconds to charge to turn and charge you in less than 1 secong, and nuke you for 80% of your HP.\n\nImaging a Tigrex muti-charging you over and over with 0.5 second charges, spins and bites.\n\nLand of Tremors was a notoriously bitch hunt.",

Wanna blind him? Well he moves non-stop and he is generally grounded so landing a flash bomb is actually hard.\n\nWanna brute force it? Well watch out because if you get cocky he can spin to win and poison you, and boom you need to waste an extra 2-3 minutes dodging him to wait for an opening to heal yourself. Too much damage in too short time? Well he is enraged now and hard as heck to pin down for an opening.\n\nHe was also primarily weak to Water, which is an -odd- element weakness in most games. \n\nIn Iceborn he felt really weak imho. He felt more like a cameo than a hunt, while in other games he was the \"optional hunt to avoid at all costs\" due to how much of a pain to deal with he was.\n\nIn Iceborn he also lost one of his key attacks: doing a scream to stun you and inmediately insta-charging you, and the claw probably made dealing with him easier by facilitating stuns.",

Wanna blind him? Well he moves non-stop and he is generally grounded so landing a flash bomb is actually hard.\n\nWanna brute force it? Well watch out because if you get cocky he can spin to win and poison you, and boom you need to waste an extra 2-3 minutes dodging him to wait for an opening to heal yourself. Too much damage in too short time? Well he is enraged now and hard as heck to pin down for an opening for the next so and so minutes.\n\nHe was also primarily weak to Water, which is an -odd- element weakness in most games.\n\nIn Iceborn he felt really weak imho. He felt more like a cameo than a hunt, while in other games he was the \"optional hunt to avoid at all costs\" due to how much of a pain to deal with he was.\n\nIn Iceborn he also lost one of his key attacks: doing a scream to stun you and inmediately insta-charging you, and the claw probably made dealing with him easier by facilitating stuns.",

Rise kinda had the same issue, but had more fights at the later stages of high rank. In Wilds, you reach the tier where you can fight a Rathalos in high rank really quick, and from there you only have Gore and non-guardian Arkveld as new stuff. Adding chameleos, or another elder dragon, into the starting roster would've helped some definitely. Or if they made Jin Dahaad a lot harder, it could've served as a decent elder dragon, but it's less difficult that Gore imo.",
