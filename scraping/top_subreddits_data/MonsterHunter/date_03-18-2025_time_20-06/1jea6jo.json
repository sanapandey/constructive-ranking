It gives you an attack boost when getting into green and lower sharpness levels, but those are offset by the damage penalties in the first place. (-25% damage in Orange and -50% in red)\n\nSo take a 200 raw weapon, Bludgeoner in Red Sharpness should give +30 attack, making it 230 raw, but then you subtract the penalty and you're at 115 raw. Or 130, depending on if the bonus is added before or after sharpness penalty. Meanwhile 200 Raw in White sharpness is a +32% bonus so 264 Raw.\n\nEven without the sharpness penalty it's inferior. It's only mildly useful with green sharpness since green is a 5% bonus, so 200 Raw + 15 from Bludgeoner x 1.05 Sharpness bonus = 225 Raw. Still less than bumping from Green to Blue (which would be 240 Raw from a 20% bonus)",
