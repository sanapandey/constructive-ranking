With the issues they have with Jin dahaad's size (and a certain cut monster they were supposed to add as well and will hopefully later), I don't think a monster his size could work. I really wish it did, but with so many PC players having performance issues as is, it just can't be justified adding a monster that would brick most PCs. I mean, his head is literally bigger than the arena. You're a speck on one of his ribcage, lmao.",

That way, you\u2019d start the fight in one of the main zones and chase the monster back to its \"nest.\" Since these areas would be small\u2014maybe three zones at most\u2014they could get really creative with map interactions and design.\n\nAdditionally, other monsters that already appear in multiple areas could migrate or flee between these subzones. But because there are designated subzones, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about long, pace-breaking chases that take 1-2 minutes",
