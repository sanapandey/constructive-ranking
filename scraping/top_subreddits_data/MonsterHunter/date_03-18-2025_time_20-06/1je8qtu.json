If you selected red, the alpha set would fade into orange and yellow but the beta set would fade into magenta and purple. And that's just from changing ONE of the two colour options on the armour. Changing the other colour affected the metallic pieces but left the flowy bits alone.\n\nIf you tried to match the beta set to the alpha set, the gradient fades in the opposite direction of the colour wheel so you can't actually get the same colour scheme.\n\nEDIT: As u/MaxinRudy tested in another reply thread, this will NOT WORK for layered armour. You only get the Alpha set as a layered option. It's listed in your layered armour set list without the Alpha or Beta designators and it follows the Alpha colour scheme.\n\n*So if you want those different gradients, you'd need to use a non-layered piece, which will obviously affect your build's available skills.*",
