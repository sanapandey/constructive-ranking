Boot into safe mode          \n2. Run DDU (uninstalled gpu drivers)          \n3. Restart        \n4. Install [latest AMD beta drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-2-1.html)          \n5. Now it's fixed\n\n**Recommended Settings**:         \n >- Upscaling mode:\n>DLSS Quality - Depend if you want some more perf, use Balanced give like almost 6-10% more perf. AND UPGRADE TO DLSS4 (v310) IS A MUST, IT LOOKS CLEANER THAN EVEN NATIVE 1080p TAA. Balanced actually look very close to Quality with >DLSS4 too, there are some artifacts compare to native but really hard to notice them. (Just google the way, it's very simple to force update).\n>Without DLSS I would recommend upgrade your FSR to FSR4 when it available, or try the newest XESS 2 which way better than the one in the game.\n-> Ray Tracing:\n>OFF - actually it's usable, RT in this game only affect reflections with like 3 overall fps drop in my test, the thing is it takes a lot of VRAM\n>- Texture Quality:\n\ufeff>High (or medium) - high to medium gives me like 1 more average fps, noticeably worse texture details, on high my vram almost always near it's limit (5.5-5.7gb), medium more manageable (4.4-5.1gb) in case there need more vram overhead\n>- Texture Filtering:\n>\ufeffMedium (ANISO x4) - make textures look cleaner when viewing from certain angles, in main menu, highest take 3 fps hit (of 70 fps), medium only about 1fps, no noticeable fps hit in-game.\n>- Mesh Quality:\n>High (or medium) - drop to medium give slightly better perf and use less vram, but reduce some polygons, noticable on some model details, like NPC hair strands less smooth, some round objects noticeably less polygons...\n>- Fur Quality:\n>Low - Seem barely improve fur quality at all so just leave it at low\n>- Sky/Cloud Quality:\n>Lowest - This setting seem doesn't do anything, no visual or perf impact, but if the gpu/vram indicator in the demonstration is true then it should be turned down.\n>- Grass/Tree Quality:\ufeff\n.Low - grasses look BETTER at Low, with shorter, less grass density = less shimmering and more ground details can be shown, easier to find small endemic life too. Hardly noticeable changes on the trees. Almost no performance difference between low and high.\n>- Grass/Tree Sway:\ufeff\n>Enable - make them more lively, barely performance increase not worth disable it\n>- Sand/Snow Quality:\n>Lowest - It looks fine and who cares about pebbles slightly more realistic anyway.\n.- Water Effects:\n>Enable - Couldn't spot any differences, assuming this affect water physics stuff, will need to test again with more water.\n>- Render Distance:\n>Medium - you'll notice the choppy animation with far away creatures with this on low, seem zero performance hit and should keep it on.\n> - Shadow Quality:\ufeff\n> High - it does take some vram but not demanding at all, High vs Medium have THE SAME performance while Low look absolutely horrible and should be avoided.\n> - Distant Shadow Quality:\ufeff\n> Low - I don't notice a lot performance impact or visual changes but lower this reduce like 100mb vram usage\n> - Shadow Distance:\ufeff\n> Far - seem no performance hit, just leave it medium or far.\n> - Ambient Light Quality:\ufeff\n> Low - TURN THIS SHT DOWN, seem like zero difference (perhaps slightly brighter rocks?) for A LOT VRAM hog\n> - Contact Shadows:\n> Enable - honestly I don't notice particular areas where this setting affect or performance hit, but from the demonstration pic should leave it on for some fine shadow details.\n> - Ambient Occlusion:\n> Medium - small perf hit, add some details to shadows kinda like contact shadows, no noticeable visual or performance changes from medium to high, some may prefer it off as it can create some smeary shadow on ground around character\n> - Bloom:\n> \ufeffHigh - Personal preference, almost no perf impact\n> - Motion Blur:\n> OFF - Less blur the better\n> - Vignette Effects:\n> OFF - personal preference, no perf impact\n> - Screen Space Reflection:\n> On - add reflections, should keep it on\n> - SSSS Scattering:\n> On - very very minimal performance impact and honestly really hard to spot differences (characters skin slightly smoother)\n> - Depth of Field:\n> \ufeffOFF - surprising turning it off like give me 2-3 more fps when in the settings menu, in Focus mode it looks pretty cinematic and can hide some ugly far away details tho\n> - Volumetric Fog:\ufeff\n> Low - noticeably save some performance, no noticeable visual change\n> - Variable Rate Shading:\ufeff\n> OFF - Turning this ON give you nearly 1% better performance at the cost of some shader grainy/fuzziness you may notice sometimes.\n> - Framegen:\n> OFF - unless you can run stable above 40fps\n> And If you don't have DLSS framegen, don't use FSR framegen - at lower fps FSR framegen in this game is the worst I've seen with a lot of flickering and artifacts. Use Lossless Scaling framegen instead, I've tested them and got better performance and visual when using them both with DLSS\n\n- [huy98vn](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/huy98vn?gameId=6993)",

            "body": "As suspect by Digital Foundry's first look into the PC version of Wilds ([Video Link](https://youtu.be/0yhacyXcizA)), it appears that the game shipped with an old build of DirectStorage (v1.1.0).\n\nThe newer versions of DS have better optimization around GPU decompression, which is suspected to be the bottleneck causing the frame timing spikes on camera movement.\n\nFortunately for PC users, we can replace the DS .dll files with the latest version, as there are no impactful breaking changes between v1.1.0 and the latest v1.2.3.\n\n* Download the latest version of DirectStorage here:\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Direct3D.DirectStorage\n\n* Rename the package extension from .nupkg to .zip and open the file. Inside the archive, locate the two .dll files in \\native\\bin\\x64\\.\n\n* Copy these and replace the existing .dll files located in the game's install directory. (Manage > Browse Local Files in Steam)\n\nIn my limited testing, it seemed like there was a reduction in FPS drop when rapidly moving the camera. However, without doing some A/B testing with frame timing graphs pulled up, it possible that this is just placebo so your mileage will vary.\n\nAs an aside, anyone running a 40XX card, check out DLSS Swapper to update those .dll's to utilize DLSS Framegen v4. It greatly reduced the awful ghosting I was getting during cut scenes. https://github.com/beeradmoore/dlss-swapper",

Since this seems to be a common problem I want to keep a thread near the top of new. \n\nIf you have no yet filled out an official capcom support form, please do. Make sure to check the official support thread in the steam forums and follow all troubleshooting steps, and mention in the details section that you've done so: https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/form\n\n**The only effective solution found so far**: Capping FPS to 30. Some people report the issue lessens noticeably if capped to 60 FPS. To me 60 and uncapped produce seemingly the same result, but YMMV\n\nTroubleshooting solutions that have **not** worked: \n\n- Running DDU to remove all graphics drivers and reinstalling\n\n- FSR3/4 seem to cause the issue equally\n\n- In game graphical settings, including changing scaling mode and raytracing don't have a noticeable effect\n\n- updating directstorage dll\n\n- Installing REframework mod\n\nInteresting note: \n\nEnabling \"RenderWorkerThreadPriorityAboveNormal\" in the config seemed to *significantly* increase stuttering issues, spiking CPU utilization, but did seem to reduce the incidence rate. I'm running a Ryzen 3700x, if anyone with a beefier CPU wants to try this and see if it's better please report back. \n\nIf you're aware of any other fixes, please let me know!",

Feel free to see my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j0f85j/gsync_is_currently_completely_broken_for_mh_wilds/) with a slow-mo video, but tldr:\n\n1. The game does not properly sync monitors' refresh rate with framerate. This causes tons of stuttering and higher GPU usage.\n2. Even if you set the game to use \"Fixed Refresh Rate\" in Nvidia Control Panel, the game will still have performance issues due to detecting Adaptive Sync on the monitor.\n3. The game will freak out if you have ANY monitors connected with Adaptive Sync enabled, not just your gaming monitor.\n4. G-Sync does not turn on at all if your gaming monitor is not your left-most screen in Windows display settings. Edit: HDR is involved here. If HDR was enabled at any point on your gaming monitor, it may or may not work.\n\n# Edit1: I HAVE FOUND A FIX FOR G-SYNC:\n\nEdit2: The new build of REFramework fixes G-Sync and makes the game run better. Do that instead: [Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93)  \n  \nTry the below if needed.\n\n1. Nvidia Control Panel settings for MH Wild:\n2. In-Game Settings:\n   * Uncapped Frame Rate: Uncapped\n   * Nvidia Reflex/Low Latency Mode: Disable\n3. Turn off Adaptive Sync on all monitors *except* your primary gaming monitor.\n4. Match the game's resolution to your monitor's resolution.\n5. If your gaming monitor had HDR enabled at any point, you may need to set it as the left-most display in Windows display settings.\n6. If you want to \"cap\" your framerate, set your monitor's maximum framerate to a lower hertz in Windows display settings. For example, 60hz to cap to 60fps.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n* Yes, this means framegen does not work with G-Sync currently.\n* G-Sync seems to worsen an issue with how volumetric fog is shaded that causes flickering. This seems to be resolved with the latest REFramework build.\n\n# Alternate Solution:\n\nPrevious instructions to disable Adaptive Sync.\n\n1. Disable \"Adaptive Sync\" in ALL of your connected monitors' settings if it's available. This cannot be done within Windows and must be done in your monitor's native settings.\n2. Nvidia Control Panel Settings for MH Wild:\n   * Low Latency Mode: Off\n   * Max Frame Rate: Off\n   * Vertical Sync: On\n3. In Windows' display settings, change the hertz of your gaming monitor to what you want the framerate cap to be. I set mine at 60hz.\n4. In-game settings:\n   * Vertical Sync: On\n   * Nvidia Reflex: Disabled",

What im really finding strange is that when monitoring my system resources, the GPU is sitting there at like 60-80%. I never saw it peak over 85%. So my question is, why is it when i uncap my framerate, lower every setting to the lowest possible setting, go from 2k to 1080, turn off v-sync.. fps goes to like.. 70-80ish? It should be like 1000fps. This game look worse than that switch port of mortal kombat on lowest settings. .

I am too poor to afford a new machine entirely either\n\nso if anyone could help pls lmk of stuff to try",

There are a few stutters here and there and I notice a few ground textures not loading properly (often in wounded hollow) but the game runs mostly smoothly for me... until my PC/game has been active after a few hours.\n\nFor some reason, the stuttering and FPS of my game gets increasingly worse the longer the game/PC is active. It would be fine for the first few hours, but the longer the game runs or the PC is active, the worse the stuttering and the FPS, to the point it has reached down to 50fps at times and monster hunts become damn near unplayable. This is most obvious on my weekends when my PC is on for the longest and I can do long gaming sessions.\n\nRestarting the game doesn't alleviate this issue, but restarting my PC does until it starts again as the hours go by. I suspect it might be a RAM issue but I am unable to find any evidence or logs to back this. This issue only occurs for MHW. I did not encounter this issue on any other game (most recently, kingdom come 2 did not have this issue when I was playing it the week before MHW released).\n\nAlready tried a few fixes and none of them worked for the degradation of performance. Only restarting my PC will temporarily alleviate the issue:\n\n* Installed Reframework (reduced the stuttering when I first play the game after a restart, but it will still get worse as time goes by)\n* Updated to DLSS 4 using DLSS Swapper (no noticeable changes for me)\n* Updated Direct Storage (no noticeable changes)\n* Tweaked various graphics settings (no noticeable changes outside of making the game look worse. Have reset them back to the highest settings outside of RT)\n* Verified files, updated Nvidia drivers, defragment/optimize drives (generic fixes, no noticeable changes)\n\nNot sure if anyone has also encountered this issue (even for other games) and if there is any permanent solution for this issue, but I am leaving this here just in case someone does. Right now I am resorting to restarting my PC every few hours but would like to avoid this as much as possible unless it really is an issue on Capcom's end.",

Now I got the game to run with 70-90 frames with balanced FSR + framegen, but I more or less expect framegen to be a nice bonus that should usually turn a 70ish fps experience into a 140 fps one. It's not something that should be used as a bandaid for games that can't even scratch 45 fps because of lack of optimization.",

Wonder if a setting is causing it or if its the copy protection or what. Didn't see others mentioning it.\n\nEdit: Rebooting fixed the issue (I had not rebooted since installing the new drivers. Its usually not necessary. Maybe a coincidence).\n\nThe game is still a touch more stuttery than I'd like though. Like, I get 80~ fps (no frame gen) average, but moving the camera fast might stutter, and sometimes I get stutter like when dropping rocks on monsters and stuff. Hopefully they fix some of that as time goes on.\n\nI miss Rise's performance. A port of a Switch game, sure, but its nice to be able to run it on a potato, and if you have a good computer you can get 240fps+. In an action game, good performance >>>> graphics.",

Only when traversing the world chasing after a monster, or during cutscenes I get small spikes. \n\nYou can mitigate these spikes further by changing the textures to medium, but for me that is a no go because it\u2019s just too low ress and I like the game to look at least decent. \n\nSoo your mileage may vary. Try different fps caps depending on your hardware. \n\nHave fun hunting :)",

For this I used the \"Lowest\" quality preset and DLSS set to \"Performance.\" FPS was monitored with MSI Afterburner+RTSS overlay.\n\nWindward Plains and Scarlet Forest fairly consistently hung around 48-55 FPS as I ran through the areas with some jumps towards 58-65 in some of the more isolated areas.  \nIceshard Cliffs and Oilwell Basin did a bit better keeping roughly over 60 fps most of the time, some dips under to \\~55 and in some of  the more isolated areas it stayed around 70 fps. Ruins of Wyveria was fairly consistent around 60 fps with some dips below and some parts going up to 70. Frametimes overall are quite inconsistent with noticeable jumps when turning the camera.\n\nAs a final test more for fun and less thorough, I stayed in the main area of Windward Plains outside the base camp where the ceratanoth are in the grassy area. I experimented with turning the resolution down, as well as trying dlss on Quality and off entirely. Turning dlss off at 4k seemed to lose me no more than 10 fps which i found somewhat baffling. Worse yet, lowering the resolution had roughly the same effect of making no more than a 5-10 fps difference, even at 720p vs 2160p. At 4k+Performance dlss and running in circles and spinning the camera here, I get \\~55-59 fps. At 720p+Performance dlss doing the same, I get \\~58-62 fps with dips as low as 53.\n\nNote that this was all done at the \"Lowest\" graphics preset. Changing the preset to Ultra, still with dlss at performance, in the same windward plains area, I get around 54-59 fps.\n\nThe way this game performs is not only bad but doesn't make any damn sense. I'd expect to see much bigger fps differences between dlss presets or different resolutions.\n\nedit: just want to note that this was all done with raytracing OFF.",

Imo is one of the best implementations of frame gen I have seen in a game. Zero glitches and basically zero input lag. I wonder what I'm doing differently. Maybe Its the frame cap I use?\n\nBy the way, just to share my experience:  \nI doubted the stability of my tuning settings. I went back to stock  values. It helped, but didnt fix the crashes. I Loaded optimized defaults in bios. Same thing. I removed cpu core 0 affinity in task manager and it helped a lot to increase stability, but it didnt fix it entirely. I still wasnt able to play at resolutions higher than 1080p.\n\nThen I uninstalled all my drivers from amd with amd cleanup tool AND DDU. I did a clear CMOS in my motherboard and tested again. No fix.\n\nThen I realized that my computer settings were not the issue. So I put everything back manually. No backup restore or stuff like that. Then I decided to check amd website for a new driver that had MHW support and to my surprise, there was a new driver that was NOT shown in adrenaline software. I installed it and tried to play the game. Problem fixed. Now I can run at 1440p or 4k with no crashes. All my undervolt and overclock profiles active.\n\n**tl;dr: check amd website for an optional driver that has support for MHW. Adrenaline may not show you this driver even if you choose to search for optional drivers.**",

However, I was able to mostly mitigate this issue by doing the following:\n\n1. Open Nvidia Control Panel\n2. Set Anti-Aliasing - Mode: Override any application setting (I'd recommend experimenting with the Enhance option as well depending on results for your hardware)\n3. Set Anti-Aliasing - Setting: 8x (or lower depending on performance)\n\nThis seemed to improve the texture wobbliness for me, but doesn't completely eliminate it. Your mileage may vary.",

At least some sort of acknowledgement at this Point on Capcom\u00b4s side would have been nice, but as far as i can tell, this hasn\u00b4t been the case.

Their installation instructions thankfully weren\u2019t too complicated and took me about only 10-15 minutes to set up properly.

Install the 'Universal' version of [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738?tab=description) (use the one in the 'dll_version' folder) and enable frame generation.\n\nAlso recommend updating the DLSS and FSR using [DLSS Swapper](https://github.com/beeradmoore/dlss-swapper) for better fidelity when using either of those.\n\nLook up how to undervolt and overclock your GPU using Afterburner. [This gentleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH8y67-7NBE) presents it quite simply. Undervolting is handy if you're getting limited by your temperature which Wilds was definitely guilty of with my 3060. The minimum and suggested specs are largely bullshit and all rely on using frame generation to achieve tolerable framerates (I quite like frame generation but a lot of people take exception to it).\n\nOn top of the built-in frame generation I use [Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) frame gen. Could also be used as an alternative to the built-in frame gen if you care about latency or artefacting. That program is miracle software for anyone, but especially for those of us with weaker hardware trying to play demanding games at higher framerates.\n\nI'll hit you with my settings later once you've tried frame gen, updating the DLSS/FSR, and undervolting+overclocking. I'm able to play the game at a variety of low/medium/high settings at (an admittedly unstable) 225fps. Granted, the 12GB VRAM of my 3060 helps, but the card is capable of playing the game at an acceptable framerate with the right tweaks and concessions. It's worth noting that I have a Ryzen 5900X which is a more powerful CPU than yours, but I believe you should still be able to pull this game off once you've put in the nerd hours.\n\nAlso, don't be too hard on your 3060! It's still the second-most used GPU according to Steam's user metrics and it's capable of playing absolute motherfuckers at good framerates once you've got it and the games tuned right.",

Nvidia overlay shows 80-90% utilization when running Wilds, but GPU power is at ~200watts and does not go any higher. For comparison, Cyberpunk will use ~300watts at 80-90% GPU utilization.\n\n\n2. Nvidia frame gen just straight up doesn't work for me. Let's say I sit in an area where I can average ~60fps with frame gen off. If I toggle Nvidia frame gen on, I still sit at the same ~60fps. If I switch to FSR and turn frame gen on, I instantly see FPS increase, so at least FSR frame gen is working. I went to the Wilds Benchmark for fun to just see if Nvidia frame gen would work in there and it seems like it does. First run I did in the benchmark without Nvidia frame gen on gave me 76.55 avg FPS, second run with Nvidia frame gen on gave me 121.45 avg FPS. So somewhere between the benchmark and the actual release, Capcom broke Nvidia frame gen.\n\nMy specs:\n\nRyzen 7 9800X3D\n\nRTX 5080 FE\n\n32GB DDR5 RAM",

I'm not savvy on these things so I'm confused why the GPU won't pull more than 200watts when it normally pulls 300watts+ at the 80-90% utilization it's claiming. I'm also confused why the Nvidia frame gen just doesn't work at all but the FSR frame gen works perfectly fine.\n\nI know this all just boils down to Capcom's terrible game optimization haha, but it's fun to look at the weirdness.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6kyhzhbwj2pe1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=32af9dce6bae9b2565508a445c4af4dc873c4957",

While the CPU is for complex computational tasks like NPC AI, Randomization functions, etc... That means that a game can utilize one more than the other depending on what it needs. Wilds for example isn't super graphically demanding (it still is compared to other games), but the bulk of it's utilization is in the world simulation (NPC AI, Monster AI, Weather cycle, wildlife animations, etc...), so it needs a LOT of CPU power, but not as much GPU power. That's why you'll see your GPU hover around 80-90% while your CPU is at 95-100%. You already have as good a CPU as one can get, so all you can do is hope Capcom optimizes the game better in the coming months.",

Performance depends a lot on the specific model (e.g. 11900K vs. 14900K), so 'i9' alone doesn\u2019t automatically mean top-tier.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at the latest Intel CPUs for gaming, an i9 might not be the best pick.   \nIt\u2019s powerful, but mostly overkill - its extra cores help with video editing and heavy multitasking, not so much with gaming. An i7, like the 14700K, performs almost the same in games, costs less, and runs cooler.  \n  \nThough personally, I would not buy any Intel CPUs nowadays. The 13th and 14th gen both have had issues with bricking themselves (though apparently fixed through updates now, but I don't trust them), and the current Ultra CPUs aren't exactly groundbreaking when it comes to gaming performance. AMD Ryzen CPUs have been leading the market for many years now. \n\nGoing back to your original question:   \nWhether you should upgrade your CPU or GPU depends on what you currently have.   \nJust grabbing a high-end CPU or GPU won\u2019t necessarily give you a massive performance boost if your other components become a bottleneck.   \nIf your CPU is too weak, even the best GPU won\u2019t perform at its full potential, and vice versa.\n\nI run this game on a RTX 3080 and Ryzen 5600X. My GPU is at 99% load and my CPU usually around 50-60%. Having said that, it also depends on what you are currently doing.  \nThey use the same engine they used for Dragons Dogma 2, which was very CPU intensive when loading NPCs - which is why I play in Online Singleplayer mode, because this avoids having other peoples player characters run around in the main bases and thus increases performance there immensely. \n\nAs you can see, there is not a simple answer to your question because it depends on many variables.",

Since we have comparable cards, I can tell you that it's good enough for pretty much every current game out there on 1080p at least high settings. In future it might change, but probably more so if you're interested in resolutions higher than 1080p (resolution and texture sizes impact VRAM the most, VRAM is basically storage that's directly on the GPU on which textures and render buffers reside).",

There is no way to get a real 60fps performance. even at 720p lowest settings, the game often drops into the 50s and sometimes high 40s in the field. I have had to cut my losses and just play at 1080p with a 30fps cap. If you're willing to drop the resolution a bit, you can make it a 40fps cap. Reducing the settings barely gets any more performance, despite being GPU bottlenecked the whole time. I'm playing off of family share, and I would absolutely not purchase it to play it like this.",

For some reason their GPU usage on Task Manager never even gets close to 100%, no matter what settings in game are applied, and the game will still stutter between 20 and 35 frames consistently.  All drivers are up to date, even the 25.2.1 driver that AMD GPU released to coincide with MHWilds.  \n\n  \nThe stranger thing is that my computer has the exact same specs as theirs, but things run FAR better for me.  The only difference between my build and their is that I have 48gb of RAM, but I really don't think the difference between 32b of ram and 48gb of ram would make this much a difference in performance.  \n\n  \nHas anyone else ran into any issues with trying to record this game on OBS with similar hardware?

That's a 4k RT card and you can barely do 1440p at medium.\n\nIf your goal is 1080p, you don't need that CPU, just wasting money.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy 1440p high at least 60fps so I went with a 7800xt and a 7700x.

Disabled MPO via registry, removed shaders, literally everything that the official thread on the Steam Forums says to do.  No idea what on earth is happening.\n\nEDIT: OK So Update.  I fully reinstalled the game, fully redid my shaders before hand (for my GPU, and Direct X, and the game).  Checked the Cutscene settings per the reply below.  They were already set to use my in game graphics, so I switched em to Medium.  Game crashed when I was standing in the world.  Then I was like \"well right now I am limiting FPS\" so I turned that off, set my general graphics to medium, and rebooted the game...and started getting 70-90 FPS constantly, without Frame Gen.

Removed all overclock. Lowered the settings. Downloaded the RE mod, the opendorectory updated mod and some dlss mod update or whatever I saw on the guides and nothing helped. I get pretty good fps outside of these stutters. Like 80+ on high without framegen. \nAny ideas how to fix it? Heard it could be the new nvidia drivers so Should I revert to some older ones? Or should I maybe wait some time for some patches and buy the game again? It just seems extremely weird. It's not even that I get bad fps. The game just lags every 5-10 seconds.\nAlso maybe another helpful thing. When I am tabbed out it simply doesn't lag or stutter at all.\nIt also giga lags in character creation for some reason( even more than in the game) My Pc works perfectly fine in everything else.\n\nUPDATE: installed older drivers (566.32) and the game works perfectly now!!!",

Ever since the morning of 4 March my game is completely unstable on Xbox Series X. Prior to that I had no problems, performance was great, and no crashes.\n\nNow the game crashes almost immediately. Occasionally I can get in to game and in the last ~36 hours Ive managed to complete one hunt. I have tried changing all available settings and reinstalling the game and nothing fixes the problem. Due to the lack of reports of similar issues I am concerned there is something wrong with something specific to my console, save file, or something else. I have not seen any acknowledgment of this problem from CAPCOM, and their latest patch says they fixed crashing issues but instead for me it has made a game I paid $90 for completely broken and unplayable. \n\nAny advice or information about this would be appreciated.",

The \"flickering\" happens and it deselects that option.

All my drivers are up to date, I even recently did a clean reinstall of my windows, drivers and stuff but to no avail. Does anyone have a fix? Also I've noticed that my Device Manager keeps refreshing every 5 seconds too? Could that mean something?

It looks particularly bad outside of plenty. Though, even in plenty the foliage/trees look bad which is quite common with the transformer model sadly.  \n  \nAll going to be subjective though. Some people like FSR3 more mostly because they like the extra sharpening and don't notice or mind any flicker/ghosting, but to me that looks worse than even DLSS4 here when it comes to flicker/ghosting.

You were not going to have a fun time running MH World on the average hardware at time of launch. 1080 and 30fps were about the best you could hope for and the game was going to look absolutely terrible. You could disable the volumetrics and claw back some performance, but the game still looked bad for how it ran. Now, on modern hardware you can just brute force your way to at least 60fps but have to keep in mind that at launch most people were still on Kepler GPUs the same way most people are still on Ampere for Wilds. And, even on Maxwell, World wasn't great similar to Wilds not being so hot on the average Ada GPU. Similar story for CPU equivalents of the time/now.  \n  \nNot to say they won't fix it, but just if they're using history as their own guide they might not see much of a reason to fix it. World reviews recovered over time and they probably expect the same to happen again here.  \n  \nThey're not good at PC ports in general, but developing for PS5 first just creates its own, additional problems. Like their very aggressive texture streaming here. Best I'm hoping for is that the PC version still outsells the PS5 version broadly and they develop PC first for the next title.",

But I could get my fps to 60 stableish just every time it would crash and flicker textures. Being stubborn I decided to  try and fix it.\n\nSo funny enough I think this may have been related to my nvme ssd as after the crash every time I would try and boot the game I would get steam disk read errors almost like the game was corrupting itself then I noticed it wasn't just wilds it was every game on the drive. \n\nSo I did some digging and this can be related to bios not being up to date to read the hard drive correctly and also permissions for the steam folder.\n\nSo I checked to see if there were any bios updates and got them installed. And then tried swapping wilds to my main boot drive and wala the issues I was having are gone . Now the game still isn't running great for a PC game but it's at least not flickering and crashing.\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt was the drive funny enough the drive still works for other games but for wilds it just hates it.  However I was also having crashing for poe2 and marvel rivals on the same drive  so maybe it's the drive speed or maybe it's just a bad drive I should get replaced.\n\nConsider looking into your hard drive if your having flickering and missing textures almost like a wire frame!",

I've seen it go up to 28GB usage.\n\nYour CPU is quite weak and sadly, Wilds has a high CPU baseline and there are no real settings you can change to reduce the load on your CPU. 6GB Vram also is not really enough, but you can reduce the VRAM usage by using low textures. I'd recommend to try to use lower texture settings. Game will look shit but maybe run a bit better. Stutters can actually also be a problem of your GPU when textures are loaded into VRAM, so using lower textures does improve the performance in that regard.",

I wouldn't bet on it providing any appreciable difference, compared to doing something like updating the shipped game's DLSS files.",

Only occasionally, but especially when previewing weapon models at the smithy or in customization screens (like Seikret customization), and occasionally character models in towns. It only started happening after I enabled raytracing and frame gen. I was playing for a while with raytracing and no frame gen and it didn't seem to occur, once I realized my FPS was stable at 60ish with raytracing (outside towns, at least) I turned on frame gen and started noticing it. It doesn't appear to be a noticeable bottleneck on any one part, I'm not seeing utilization above 85ish% in any of my components when this happens\n\nside note: I'm playing 1080p, the 9070xt is a beefy card but the optimization on this game is still super rough so be ready to turn some stuff down if you wanna play above stable 30fps on 1440p/4k",

So I disabled it entirely and haven't had a single crash since. I also disabled steam overlay and don't keep any other non-essential programs running just in case as I've read that Medal or MSI Afterburner can also reproducibly cause frame gen to crash. Seems like Wilds just needs to be ran by itself in isolation. \n\nMy system is a 4090 + i9 13900K and with this fix and others mentioned in the thread I can finally get a stable 120 fps with RT on high and the resolution at \"4K\" (set to 4K but in game ratio set to 21:9 which leaves black borders on top and bottom of screen).",

Forget crashing, I couldn\u2019t even play the game long enough to experience one because I must have only gotten 10 fps max even tampering with settings to make it as playable as I could. Installed the nexus reframework mod or whatever it\u2019s called, that made it a little better but still not anywhere near playable for anyone to accept. It is so odd that I can turn EVERY setting to the lowest and it changes jack all nothing. Sometimes, it looked like it could run smooth but the input delay was genuinely 10 seconds back pressing any button. Even the damn mouse in the menu is slow like what? Absolutely no game has run this shitty for me and I always put it at maxed graphics. I was excited but honestly even if they did fix this somehow, I\u2019m just over it at this point. Refunded bc why am I going to waste time when there are plenty of other games?",

What I did was install RE Framework, enable latest DLSS through Nvidia app, enable frame generation, limit cap to 30, set RTSS frame limiter scanline sync to -200 with Nvidia reflex. This gives me smooth 60 fps with bearable latency (around 100 according to Nvidia overlay). Options are set to medium with performance upscaling. Still get texture issues and frametime dips time to time but I can nevertheless enjoy the game this way.",

Granted, I use an a770, but it seems it has similar increases in performance for most people despite different models. You\u2019ll still definitely get a performance boost doing this, but some people only may get a 5~ fps increase (which is still substantial, but in general take my claim with a grain of salt). \n\nI believe I found this tip from a forum on Intel, but I forgot which exactly. \n\nThis was very significant for Monster Hunter Wilds as I jumped from a constant 25 fps with medium settings with no frame generation to 45 fps by simply downgrading my driver. When switching to AMD FSR and enabling frame gen, I could finally play wilds with a constant 60 fps and actually serviceable visuals. \n\nWhile optional, I also used Reframework, RTSS (to see fps on side+ cap fps better imo), and some optimization of gpu and cpu mods to push my visuals to a slightly higher quality while maintaining a good stable fps. In general, I recommend just getting Reframework, cpu optimization mods from nexus, and specifically the IO stutter fix mod from nexus since for some reason turning fast in vanilla can make your frames drop thus it felt somewhat of a necessary mod to use.\n\nI really don\u2019t like needing to jump through hoops to play a game on medium/high settings, but often developers don\u2019t get time to or do not care much about PC optimization in general and optimization depending on what GPU you are using. It could also just be the engine capcom uses for their games are not very great at open world optimization as seen with DD2.",

Beware tho that Framegen generally slightly increases the latency even the Nvidia one. I personally find it not too noticable in Wilds though. Reflex might help with that.\n\nYou will need two mods to do this. Reframework and dlssg-to-fsr3, both to be found on Nexusmods.\n\nYou first install Reframework and then run the game and in the GUI you enable the loose file loading. Then you download the dlssg-to-fsr3 (universal Version) and put all the files in the folder DLL Version in the Monster Hunter Wilds installation directory. Now you should be able to enable framegen along with dlss in the menu.\n\nI personally also recommend getting the mod Disable Lens Distortion (also on Nexusmods) because the game has that applied to the entire screen which makes everything blurry. Of course in the interest of better performance I recommend upgrading the DLSS .dll files to the newest version, along with the direct Storage .dll files.\n\nReframework:  \n[https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93)\n\ndlssg-to-fsr3:  \n[https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738?tab=files](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738?tab=files)\n\nDisable Lens Distortion:  \n[https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/245](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/245)",

Only if I capped the game to 70 fps, then Wilds with FG would make max 140. So if someone is using gsync, FG might give you more frames than your refresh rate and you might experience a slight delay or stutter at times when you exceed the rate. Just thought it was noteworthy. I can't say if the same happens with Nvidia's FG as I have not tested it.\n\n(I'm using a 30 series, so I'm using FSR for FG at the time being, i know there is mods and stuff you can do to use FG with 30 series, but I decide to not dive into that rabbit hole at this point)",

Konnte also nur noch mit den Einstellungen der AMD Adrenalin Treiber zu tun haben. Meine Vermutung --> Fluid Motion Frames und Frame Gen machen ein Problem, weil sich ja Frame Gen im Game nicht aktivieren lie\u00df ABER aktiv war laut AMD Overlay. Das hei\u00dft dass die neuen 25.3.1 Treiber Fluid Motion Frames 2.1 + Frame Gen au\u00dferhalb vom Spiel \u00fcber die Global Settings automatisch aktiv stellen. Nun hab ich folgendes gemacht: In das manuelle Setup der Treiber f\u00fcr Monster Hunter Wilds rein --> dort bei \"Suchmodus\" Hoch und bei \"Leistungsmodus\" auf Leistung eingestellt und OH WUNDER. Spiel l\u00e4uft mit 137 fps auf Ultra Einstellungen bei FSR und Qualit\u00e4t + Sch\u00e4rfung auf 80% hoch absolut fl\u00fcssig. Keine Ruckler mehr, v.a. kein Nachladen innerhalb der Cutscenes. AMD muss echt aufpassen was sie da standardm\u00e4\u00dfig in den Treiber-Setting f\u00fcr die HYPR RX Einstellungen konfigurieren, wenn das so krasse Auswirkungen hat.",

Thermal throttle: Basically the gpu runs too hot, and need to limit the performance to prevent it from burning itself up. This relies on the laptop cooling solution to bring the temperature down, so you should check if your laptop cooling fans are blocked or dusty, that can affect the cooling performance. Alternatively get external laptop coolers may help (or not, im not an expert on this, please read up more if you intend to get an external solution). Theres also the thermal cooling performance of the laptop itself, if its poorly designed, then you can only go so much without an external solution.\n\n\n2. Power throttle: I dont think you can do much on this. Its entirely up to the laptop design on how much maximum power they allow the gpu to pull from the system. Lower max power = gpu can only go to a lower clock speed = limited performance. This is where mobile gpu performance gets tricky on laptops, you don't really know if one laptop advertising 4080 mobile is the same as another laptop's 4080 mobile, because the they can have wildly different power limit for the gpu resulting in very big difference in performance.\u00a0\n\n\nAt least this is my limited understanding of laptop gpus, and why I tend to avoid gaming laptops in general.",

Can get a locked 60fps for the most part with 1440p DLAA and framegen off. Everything else is maxed, RT on High. If you set textures to Highest with my setup, out in hunts you can get 55-60fps mostly stable but inside towns it's a huge mess so I just keep things on High for now and that's much more stable and even feels fine. REFramework is important since otherwise their anti-tamper destroys frametime consistency everywhere--I doubt they will be fixing that themselves, ever.       \n  \nGame just naturally looks bad though in my opinion, in an art direction kind of way. It has poor contrast and low saturation with environmental textures that look terrible even if you did destroy your framerate in towns by setting it to Highest. A lot of that is due to poor lighting quality, really, since it's not really RT GI everywhere. It often looks about as bad as launch Forspoken in that regard. Some of it is due to poor implementation of lens effects and just a generally incorrect color correction. Modders are trying to untangle some of it, but it's rough since if you just entirely disable some effects you can get the environment/general experience looking better but then monster effects look worse. For what it's worth, I also thought World looked bad but actually this just looks worse than World somehow, again in an art direction way. I much prefer Tri/the 3DS games/Rise in that respect.",

The reason I mention increasing your framerate is that higher framerates result in lower latency, so if your framerate is already high then enabling frame-gen has a lower latency impact.\n\nAll that being said, who knows what the base latency for the game is gonna be, you should try with frame-gen on and off and see if you can tell a difference in your responsiveness.
