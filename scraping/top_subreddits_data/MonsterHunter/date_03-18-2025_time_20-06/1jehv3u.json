    "selftext": "I just wanna say, out of all the characters In Wilds, Erik quickly became my favorite. I love his design, his voice actor, and his overall vibe. The only thing I don't like is how little we got of him. I also enjoy that he's not some big buff, grussled guy with a beard. It's definitely nice to have a character that doesn't fit the \"mold\" of what some people think guys should act like or look. \n\nThis isn't a post bashing Alma btw, she's great, but i think it would be awesome if we could choose our handler. The closest we got to him being that for our Hunter was during the Ray Dau quest when he authorizes us to hunt it. Unfortunately it seems he's Olvia's handler so I don't know how that could work. \n\n\nJust lemme bring the biology twink with me on hunts Capcom :( ",
