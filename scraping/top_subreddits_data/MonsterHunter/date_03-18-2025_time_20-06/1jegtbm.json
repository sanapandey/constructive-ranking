They might sound similar described like this, but CB guard points and Offsets are way different in execution.\n\nThe golfswing is a powerful hit that can double toward powering through attacks and getting a brief topple on a monster; the fact you can delay the swing and time it means it's entirely meant as a deliberate tool. CB's guard points weren't ever super-powerful attacks by themselves, it was some of the options you can follow them up with that are. And unlike most Offset attacks, the guard points have the benefit of protecting you; a lot of CB's guard points are the ones that end in the sword roundslash, which makes them decent at protecting you at the end of those combos.",
