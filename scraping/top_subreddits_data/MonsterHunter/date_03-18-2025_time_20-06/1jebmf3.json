    "selftext": "I have 20 hours of fishing in Wilds so far and I often see people complaining about the fishing & the Gravid bowfin here.\n\n**Basics**: there are 3 general types of movement in fishing. \n1. Slow reel\n2. fast reel\n3. Jigging\nTo do either of the reeling options, move your L joystick up and down without letting go. Do it at a speed that you hear a moving sound. You can adjust the speed of this movement to go either slow or fast respectively. For jigging, repeatedly move your joystick down, then release, then down repeatedly. If done right, the lure should be bobbing towards you. \n\n**Each fish species are attracted to a different type of movement**. For example, Sushifish are attracted to slow reeling, whetfish fast reeling, and the cephalopods like escunites are jigging. Feel free to ask about a fish species down below. When fishing and you don\u2019t know a fish\u2019s preferred movement, try all 3 until you see interest.\n\n**lures**: you start with one basic lure. You can catch any fish species with any lure, but some lures catch some fish better. Emerald Jitterbaits (I may butcher lure names) are commonly used in many fish species. I recommend reading each lure description to find what fish it catches or ask a question about a fish\u2019s preferred lure down below.\n\n**Whoppers** the 2nd thing I see complained about most during fishing. Whoppers prefer specific lures too, Gasternome Tuna, Great Trevally, & spear tuna prefer Tuff Joint Bait. Gajau goes for Duster Rig, & the squid likes the tentacle jig. The 3 I listed for Tuff joint prefer fast reel movement, Squid is jigging, & Gajau is slow reel. \n\nWhen fighting a whopper, try to follow its movements by moving your rod into the direction it is moving. If you fail this, the line could snap. If a whopper jumps, click r2 right as it jumps to send it back into the water. When a whopper is tired (fish stops moving, your hunter moves rod to top left) repeatedly do the fast reeling movement to bring it closer. When fishing for a whopper, cast out of the way of obstacles. They can snap your line. Another movement for whopper fishing is to change the direction, which is to move L joystick left and right fast once in the direction you want. This is unnecessary though. \n\n**Gravid Bowfin** I see complaints often about this fish. It actually spawns in many locations. I\u2019ve seen people mention the lake by 12 scarlet forest. **I do not find this spot the best** however. Too much species diversity. Spots I found best are: Oilwells Area 12, Hidden cave in Wyveria, & Iceshard Cliffs area 1.\n\nThe lure used for Gravid Bowfins is the emerald Jitterbait. \n\nNow for the hardest part: catching it. It isn\u2019t so bad once you learn how to catch it. It prefers slow reel, but only do slow reel in small increments. **Do not consistently reel.** it is kind of like jigging, but with slow reel. If a Gravid bowfin is attracted, stop moving your rod. If it leaves, then continue to reel. When it bites, reel it in when you see the rod animation. Too early & too late results in losing the fish. \n\n**Other tips & info**\nGolden fish are common in underground or caved areas. Same with Gunpowder fish & the goldfish thing.\n\nYou can catch crowned fish with a net. It counts.\n\nPetricanthus can be found in area 14 oil well rarely and more commonly in the scarlet forest area 16 ruin interior at night. \n\nFeel free to ask for more tips!",

            "body": "The best tip for Whoppers is once they surface, looking at your bait, start reeling in.  For the whoppers that don't surface, you can still do this, you just have to realize when they are locked onto your bait and start reeling in.  You can get it basically right up to the edge of the water before you stop, and the fish will follow the bait the whole time.  Once you stop that motion, they'll bite.  So hit R2 or whatever then.  While you still have to do the whopper mini game, technically, usually you can just ignore the back and forth motion and just go up and down to reel them in the last few inches and they'll be caught almost immediately.  Even if you go back and forth and wait for the fish to be tired, it's much much faster and less likely for your line to break.",

It makes it look like you just go straight up and straight down.

And if you're on PC with keyboard you don't have the option to rotate the joystick. \n\nI've just found a rotating motion easier to use and more consistent.",
