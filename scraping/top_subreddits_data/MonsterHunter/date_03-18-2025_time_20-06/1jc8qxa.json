                    "body": "There are a lot of widespread misconceptions about how capture rewards work. tl;dr they think they're getting screwed out of drops when you capture, but they're incorrect. \n\nIn previous games other than World, captures gave 2 to 3 rewards, and they came from a different loot table than carves. Depending on what drops you were looking for, capturing could be better or worse. This isn't the case in Wilds; capturing is always 3 drops (unless you have Capture Pro Meal from Tasheen cooking for you, in which case it's 4) and as far as I can tell they come from the same loot table as carves (there's not a capture loot table in the game, and despite some people insisting that it uses the target rewards table like the end of quest rewards, I have yet to see a single target-reward-exclusive drop, such as a certificate or elemental sac, after *a lot* of captures so I don't believe that to be the case). Unless they have the Pro Carver Meal from whatserface in Azuz (which gives a chance for up to three bonus carves), or unless they're still trying to get a part break that they still for some reason have not accomplished by the time the monster is capturable, then capturing is entirely equivalent to carving in terms of rewards.",

This is all how the games before World worked, too, or at least back to 2nd gen (1st gen is hard to say because I've never seen info on the capture tables, and tranqs weren't craftable, so you could only capture on quests that happened to have tranq bombs in the supply box, so testing isn't very convenient)",

The final bosses, arkveld and gore magdala are fast and annoying, but not bad.

LBG cares about shot type up (Normal, Pierce, Rapid), Opening Shot and/or Tetrad Shot if they fit. They both can use Weakness Exploit, Agitator, the Gore bonus and associated skills (Antivirus, Coalescence), Latent Power, affinity boosting skills (except Max Might, since DBs use lots of stamina all the time), and any flat attack boosting skills.\n\n2) Should you bother with it depends on the weapon and the other available choices. Most of the weapons like that in game right now are solely raw, and outclassed by the Artian weapons. Artian weapons, once infused with 3 attack parts, end up with 205 true raw and 5% affinity plus whatever element or status you put on it (usually paralysis), and white sharpness for melee weapons. These are about on par with most max rarity monster craftables depending on weapon but will always have 3 level 3 deco slots. Once reinforced, pretty much regardless of what rolls you get, they're better. With ideal rolls, they virtually always come out on top (except for Horn, GL, and niche builds).\n\n3) Capturing large monsters involves traps (shock or pitfall) and tranq bombs/ammo/knives, not the capture net on your item bar. You know it's capturable because it will have a skull icon on the upper right in the minimap. It needs to be low enough health (skull icon), caught in a trap and over the tranq threshold (usually 2 tranq bombs) to be captured. You can do this in any order. I prefer to see the skull icon, trap, then tranq while it's in the trap. Some people prefer to tranq first (the effect lasts a minute or two, I'm not exactly sure on timing) then trap.",

It\u2019s either big gold crown or silver crown?\n\nOkay, seems like you lack some more information:\n\nCrowns are respective of biggest recorded monster size. Monsters in a certain threshold have silver crowns, and the biggest versions of a monster have gold crowns.\n\nThere are also small gold crowns for the smallest versions of a monster, but no small silver crown.\n\nAs the game only records the biggest and smallest version of a monster you encountered, getting a big gold crown overrides a silver crown, but that doesn't happen in the other direction.",

I\u2019ve seen great reviews about MH **World** but there\u2019s the new release, **MH Wilds**. What do you all recommend in terms of price/worth and performance ?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

There are a lot of systems going on that can be confusing to deal with, between the items, combat, and other features.\n\nItems: As a beginner, you can just use the radial menu > optimal healing for most of the game. Some other important items are flash pods and traps. Flash pods will blind the monster briefly and are super helpful against flying monsters. Traps will stun the monster for a decent time and give you an opportunity to do free damage. You can also capture monsters when they are low on health (skulls on the minimap) by trapping them and hitting them with tranquilizer bombs. If the inventory is getting too clogged, I suggest going to a camp and storing away all the items you don't think you will use.\n\nCombat: I don't know what weapon you are using, but seems like you just need to get a little closer to the monster, which is something you will just learn by playing. One small tip I can give is that usually you want to be in front of and slightly to the side of the monster. This will put you in striking distance, yet give you time to react to the monsters' telegraphed attacks. That being said, a lot of the early game monsters you can usually get away with button-mashing, so you can treat them as practice for your combos and learn your weapon.",

Giving us the ability to travel as the crow flies (quite literally), with the palamute tuned to rival that speed on the ground. It became monotonously easy to locate your target, resources, and environmentals while avoiding everything else. The pet customization is peak for the franchise, although the palamute being centered around different ways to deal damage is stale compared to the palicos kits. The monster movelists need a mention, in rise you can recover from a knockdown instantly, so most monsters have potent wake-up attacks and combos to keep the pressure on.\n\nATM Wilds shows its rushed nature, but even with the first few patches we\u2019re seeing changes. Map traversal is quite aggravating with the weaving multilevel maps and seikret only paths, low rank stifles exploration and group play to tell its story, and outside of fighting the apex monsters + gore/arkveld their isn\u2019t a whole lot to do postgame.",
