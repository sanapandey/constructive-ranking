I also didn't get rare or common from emerald.\n\nSorry for the borderline useless screenshot, I didn't think to screenshot the rewards page. But I did get 6 wins 1 loss. ",

I even wasted gold on GDB packs searching for a legendary, hit the damn pity timer at 40, missed the card I wanted, then as an added insult to injury I was gifted Great Dark packs instead of the new expansion.  It's rather upsetting lol",

To fix my situation, they would have to take cards away from my collection and replace the packs with Emerald Dream.  I also used 2 tickets so I could get the new expansion packs after my free entry gave me GDB, so will I get those tickets back?  I'm guessing not.",
