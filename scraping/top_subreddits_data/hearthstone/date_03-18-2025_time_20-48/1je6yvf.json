You shouldn't need to click the cast when drawn spells because just like if we had to manually click to draw it would be bad QoL. You're forced to play it immediately for 0 mana when drawn (probably for balance reasons) so the game does your action for you, just like it does for drawing cards even though the game drawing cards for you is proccing effects that say when YOU draw a card.",
