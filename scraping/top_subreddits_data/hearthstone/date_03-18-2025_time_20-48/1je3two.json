That's completely fair of him. Idk why you're trying to frame him as someone who only complains about tier 3 decks.

You have zero proof that devs make changes based on their own opinions. If anything, we have plenty of patches with notes where devs explicitly talk about nerfing cards because of community outcry. Take Quasar as a very notable example. You're just confidently making things up based on vibes.",
