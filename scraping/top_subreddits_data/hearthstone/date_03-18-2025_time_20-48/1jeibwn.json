I only got one of the big preorders, so while I can make *most* of a leech death knight deck, I didn't open both copies of the epic. \n\nHowever, you get one run for free, so I'd recommend grabbing one of those decklists that don't require any (or many) of the new cards and just see how things go. I definitely encountered a mix of random homebrew decks and whales who probably bought multiple preorders based on the number of ED legendaries they played.",
