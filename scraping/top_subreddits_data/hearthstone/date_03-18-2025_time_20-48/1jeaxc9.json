(Technically, there's a couple of non-trade minions that do, but they either say that they do so on their card text, or are cards that shuffle in a copy with a buff that also says so on the card text.)\n\nSo with Wallow, it seems you definitely don't want to pick the dark gift to put it in back in your deck once you have drawn it.\n\nIt is very annoying though, since the wording on Wallow makes you think that it should continue to have the buffs. \n\nIf you look more closely though, it is only when the card is in your hand or deck, that it gains the buffs. \n\nSo what happens is, as it re-enters your deck, all the other buffs are wiped from it, leaving only the last +4/+5 on top of deck dark gift, and then, from then on, any dark gift you pick will be added back onto to Wallow, until either, you play it, or you pick the +4/+5 buff that will put it back in the deck.",
