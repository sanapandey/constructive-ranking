The news piece said the packs would be:\n\n* 1st Drop: 3 Year of the Pegasus Packs\n* 2nd Drop: 3 The Great Dark Beyond Packs\n* 3rd Drop: 4 Into the Emerald Dream Packs\n\nWhat's showing up in Twitch is:\n\n* 1st Drop: 3 The Great Dark Beyond Packs\n* 2nd Drop: 3 Into the Emerald Dream Packs\n* 3rd Drop: 2 Into the Emerald Dream Packs & 2 The Great Dark Beyond Packs\n\n\nSo same number of packs, but instead of Pegasus packs we get two extra Great Dark Beyond and one Emerald Dream. Odd.",
