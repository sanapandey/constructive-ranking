I\u2019m so angry and frustrated with this rework entirely ruining the spirit of the card, a card that I actively sought and grinded a signature for cause it was so cool. But now it\u2019s a dud that has no connection to Raza whatsoever, and that\u2019s so dumb for a card with such amazing art. Do I just take the 3200 or enjoy the signature for what it could have been ",
