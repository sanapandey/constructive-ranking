So I know I'll get a refund on the vbucks, but I'm only really seeing it as adding OG pass to the mix for me, and giving me the vbucks. That's still \"value\", but imo not enough for me to consider it. I get enough vbucks every BP to get the next one, so this would be me paying money when I don't have to.\n\nIf you do like every mode though?

You get so much stuff that you are bound to get at least a big handful of things you like/want that normally would have cost you way more to pick up if it had been in the shop. Esp considering you get all the other passes and vbucks to boot. I dislike being essentially forced into keeping up a monthly subscription now buuut in the end I do feel its a good deal so I sort of ignore that aspect and just let them have my $11.99 a month. >.>",
