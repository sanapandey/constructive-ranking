Problem is, this has no cooldown (unlike the Typhoon Blade), which means that inside closed spaces you can keep knocking people into a wall, doing 60 damage or so every time while preventing them from being able to do almost anything to you.\n\nI've been on the receiving end of this enough times to begin hating that bat with a passion.",
