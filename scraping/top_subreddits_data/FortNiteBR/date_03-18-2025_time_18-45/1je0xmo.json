            "body": "There's a lot of reasons why OG isn't as popular as BR, especially ranked.\n\n1. The main theme and activities are all BR related.\n2. People like the later seasons of chapter 1 more than the early seasons. (Seasons 4-9 generally)\n3. The chapter 1 map is really bad for ZB.\n4. No one plays ranked OG because the competitive side of Fortnite is pretty much exclusive to BR.\n5. People get worn out. Even if a lot of people like chapter 1 more (myself included) than the other chapters there's still only so much you can play it before you get worn out and want something new.\n6. Epic isn't releasing weekly updates like they did during actual chapter 1.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing a lot of other reasons, but that's what I could think of on the spot.",

                    "body": "Here's another critically important one: There are a myriad of other ranked modes already. If you assume the player base for ranked battle Royale style modes is already a small population, these modes divide that playerbase even more among them. Then, because of how each ranked mode works, the matchmaking queue for each of those ranked modes is also subdivided into smaller player bases (the difference between a silver I and a Diamond III). \n\nAll if this has a sort of exponential effect on player count loss. Unlock other mode \"failures\" like rocket racing, the less players that play in a specific queue, the longer the queue is, the more likely people are to queue into something more popular, thus bringing the total playercount down even more, repeat. \n\nI think it happened to OG specifically because of your reasons though, but it's why Ranked has become a meme now.",

OG fort playlist is quite good but its not a 1 to 1 replication, and it never could be. There also more playlists now then ever before for players in fortnite to play, including reload for a nostalgic experience. Not to mention fortnite OG really started to cement its legacy with the rocket event and forward.

BUT, they also trained players to expect extremely quick matchmaking by injecting a fuck ton of bots into every experience to fill.\n\nNo one has any patience for a proper ranked matchmaking experience. Especially given the fact that these are 100 player lobbies. Take that vs something like Marvel Rivals. Who has one ranked mode and 12 player lobbies. Those fill in an instant.\n\nI personally got used to waiting years ago. Sometimes 15-20min for proper matchmaking, then only to be kicked out when a player d/c's from lobby to wait again. I can tolerate waiting.\n\nMy friend who I've tried to play ranked with on the other hand is wondering why we are waiting at 1min, pissed at 2mins and ready to quit at 3mins. And we are older dudes.\n\nI can only imagine younger people just straight quit at less than 30seconds. So none of these games ever get filled cause people consistently are abandoning the queue.\n\nEpic fucked themselves by basically training people to expect instant game fills because 1/2 the lobby or more are bots. Combine that with too many games modes and too much ranked and at the end of the day trying to get ranked to actually fill is a nightmare. Especially if they are trying to limit bots.\n\nI don't quite understand their thought process when it comes to having so many modes and so many bots. I think people would have been just fine playing the modes currently availiable and there was no reason to spread them across multiple modes. And if they had limited bots from beginning maybe players would be happier with the quality of individual games vs waiting slightly longer. I'd personally rather wait around 90 seconds for a limited bot lobby than go in at 30 seconds and have a shit experience. What the point of saving a minute only to then waste 30minutes only fighting one other squad? The game being pvp is a straight lie at this point and it ain't fun to just spend all game rolling bots until the last circle.",

Competitive players that stay in their damn mode after getting to their desired rank instead of immediately going back to the casual queue to roflstomp players trying to have fun are slim to none. The most populated ranked modes only stay populated because the people leaving ranked is equal to the people joining ranked.\n\nAll this is to say when you're drawing from a player pool that's already split 6 different ways by default and add even further splits, you aren't going to exactly foster a well populated mode.

But have it permanently available and you'll realize (especially if you've been playing for years) how much QoL it lacks compared to current Fortnite.\n\nThe only reason Fortnite is still thriving and existing is because it continues to innovate each season with new ideas and gimmicks alongside it's collabs.",
