And because I want to get better at fortnite. Right now i have just over 25 hours, 12 victory royales and make it to the top 25 most times.  These Games were played on the Nintendo Switch zero build. \n\nMy Goals are: 7 wins. 500 kills. To learn a lot about fortnite and salty Springs. \n\nWhy salty? Because I want to do this many more times I'm not a very noteworthy (or notable) Fortnite player and I think doing 100 drops many Times is going to give me an edge. LTN started with salty so I'll do the same. (And salty is also one of my favorite locations.)\n\nThe stats.\nGame 1: placed 49. Kills:4\n\nGame 2: placed 75. Kills:3\n\nGame 3: placed 45.

Kills:16 (second place on game 100 hurts  sooooo bad)\n\nAfterword:\n\nDropping salty Springs 100 times was some of the most fun I've ever had playing fortnite. Will I drop salty ever again? Probably not there aren't too many chests and even if you can kill everyone in salty Springs you aren't gonna get out with that much loot. But it's still good fun. \n\nIf you want to do 100 drops yourself I'd recommend doing it in a different location with more chests. \n\nNow to see if I achieved my goals! \n\nMy win goal was:7 my win total was: 11. \n\nMy kill goal was:500 my kill total was:748.\n\nDid I learn a lot about fortnite and salty Springs? \n\nYes. I can traverse the area amazingly and I'm so much better at the game than I was a hundred games ago. \n\nThank you so much for Reading. I will be back with another 100 drops and please stay notable. \n\n(If you notice an issue or mistake with my post please message me on reddit.)\n\n\n",
