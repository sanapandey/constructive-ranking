They even made a samurai Vader and Storm Trooper last season for literally no reason at all other than to shill out even more Star Wars cosmetics. You SW nerds, should be grateful for all they've given you cosmetic-wise. The same goes for the Marvel nerds too. Also not using the term nerd as an insult. I just mean like the die-hard fans. I don't think it's too much to ask to have just a few seasons without Star Wars or Marvel being shoved down our throats. I understand the item shops because they need to make money and obviously the stuff sells, but they make more than enough off the item shop alone every single night. There's literally no reason to do an entire 3 month bp full of only that series of cosmetics. The mini passes I completely understand and they've already done like 2 or 3 of those. Not to mention it seems like almost every year now around Christmas time they decide to bring the lightsabers back to BR with some boring half-assed \"event\" if you can even call it that. If they ever do maybe like a space-themed season, I'm open to the idea of maybe inserting like a few SW POIs on the map with some lightsabers, blasters, and a few cosmetics here and there in the bp, but I would want to see more original characters and loot for that season as a whole. They've literally even gone back and done the original trilogy on top of all the modern stuff they've released. Why can't that be enough until the next random item shop drop in probably a few months down the road?",

The 2nd time I understand because a lot of people missed out on the first one, but I really hope they never do it again. I'm aware Star Wars has more characters, but we don't need a battlepass for those. They can easily be released in the shop slowly over time and I can almost guarantee they're already working on the next one",
