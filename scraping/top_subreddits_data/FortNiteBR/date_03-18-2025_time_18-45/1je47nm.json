Train should be coming down the track, just jump on and throw thermite at the first turret, then jump down and run along the ground to avoid the 2nd turret. Jump up and hit it with thermite and drop down between the two cars. Jump up once it\u2019s destroyed and loot the thermite and then open the train hatch with thermite. Collect the other thermite from the first turret, then jump down inside when it blows and throw extra thermite at the side with the gold if you need gold. Don\u2019t do this if you\u2019re full or near full on gold, it will make looting more difficult. Collect two doll coins and the mythic sentinel pump. Then head to whatever black market you like.",
