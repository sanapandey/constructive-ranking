This is R. Erdo claiming himself dictator for life. If there is international pressure added he'll just rescind the decision by order to the higher court in the appeal process. If anyone thinks there is any actual legal basis for the current decision, I have a bridge to sell you.\n\nI understand the predicemant that western governments face. You can't openly protest this course since you don't want Turkey moving towards Russian influence. I just hope that a deft and effective course of action is thought of.",

Istanbul University Rectorate itself explained that \u0130mamo\u011flu applied for the quota for transfer abroad announced by the university and that his application was evaluated and accepted according to the relevant articles. The guy above is right, the transfer's legality is questioned based on the argument that Y\u00d6K (Turkish University Education Instutiton) didn't recognize the TRNC university back then. Not because \"he transferred from private university to state university without exam\" bullshit, he transferred according to all of what's written. Even according to countless lawyers  the University Board of Directors approved \u0130mamo\u011flu's transfer to the English Department of the Faculty of Business Administration on the grounds that he met the grade point average and timely application criteria. TNRC University might not be recognized at the time but there are written criteria around that legalizes his diploma. There are countless other legit diplomas like his that are official.

And it\u2019s a state university, by the way. Why can\u2019t regular people do this then?

The fact is that the opposition candidate lacks a university diploma obtained through the standard university exam, which the vast majority of ordinary people take.
