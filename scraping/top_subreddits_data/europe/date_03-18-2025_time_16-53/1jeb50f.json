Do you even watch the full speeches and interviews or do you just read random articles that take one sentence and use it completely out of context? Also, the person who insulted his attire was a reporter. Trump defended him and said he looked nice. So clearly you're not watching anything in its entirety. Yes, the US is 33 trillion in debt thanks to horrible government spending, hence why the majority of Americans don't want anymore money being printed to fund foreign wars.",
