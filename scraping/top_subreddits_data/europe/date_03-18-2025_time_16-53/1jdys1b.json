Stop trying bothsideism.\n\n>But you\u2019re conveniently ignoring the part where Greek Cypriots spent a decade stripping them of their rights, forcing them into enclaves, and pushing enosis with Greece. If Turkey had a plan for partition, Greek Cypriots sure made it easy for them\n\nOh my! The 75% greek island wanted unification with their homeland against the wishes of their coloniser Britain and this is sth you hold against them? They tried to be liberated against UK, not against Turk Cypriots. The latter went mostly encouraged by Turkey in enclaves to make their own state, as they try to do now. But as you don't want to believe the Turkish Cypriot president who talks on camera about Turks initiating violence against Turks, you won't believe this as well. I am sure that even the result (segregated communities forced by Turkey) might show you who was the one that always wanted and worked for the segregation.\n\n>And the UN? Really? You mean the same UN that stood by while Turkish Cypriots were being attacked for years and did nothing? The same UN that has a long history of turning a blind eye to geopolitical realities when it doesn\u2019t suit the major powers? If the UN\u2019s inaction is your gold standard for legitimacy, that\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nThis is embarrassing for you. The UN condemned the **intercommunal violence** of the 60s with resolutions, condemning both eoka b and the Turkish paramilitary fascist organisations. And for a decade the two communities were living quietly until Turkey came, but I guess this doesn't serve your narrative.\n\nYou know who else accuses United Nations that they are hypocrites? Russia. Just like you, they are condemned by the whole world and they mumble the same false justifications that you do, nothing but nonsense with the hope that they will persuade someone in the internet. You cannot in the real world, thankfully. The evidences are overwhelming.\u00a0\n\n>The funniest part? If you\u2019d actually bothered to read what I\u2019ve said, you\u2019d know I don\u2019t justify what Turkey has done since 1974. I think what they\u2019ve done to the north of Cyprus is horrific. But pretending that Greek Cypriots didn\u2019t create the conditions that led to 1974 is historical revisionism at its finest. Maybe step outside your echo chamber for once.\n\nJust because you condemned **one of their many crimes** and then at the same time you justify it, this maybe the funniest part indeed.\n\nWhy do you support the Turkish propaganda against the United Nation's resolutions and the whole world? Are all the world an echo chamber, while you and the perpetrator Turkey are the only ones who know the truth? Why you didn't convince even your allies, nobody in the world with these \"arguments\"?",

In reality, they were being systematically shut out, attacked, and pushed into enclaves with no real choice but to withdraw. It\u2019s like blaming someone for leaving a rigged game when the other side is holding all the cards.\n\nBringing up \u201cTurkish policy\u201d as some kind of historical gotcha is laughable. If we\u2019re playing that game, should we start listing all the times Greece pursued *enosis* at the expense of its neighbours? Or is historical cherry-picking only acceptable when it suits your argument?\n\nCalling the constitutional amendments \u201cfair representation\u201d is a joke. The whole point of the 1960 Constitution was to balance power between both communities, yet the Greek Cypriot leadership moved immediately to strip Turkish Cypriots of their rights without their consent. If the roles were reversed, it would be called what it actually was - oppression.\n\nThe claim that Turkey was already an aggressor before 1974 ignores the reality of what led to incidents like the battle of Tylliria. The Cypriot National Guard was already bombarding Turkish Cypriot enclaves, so let\u2019s not pretend Turkey just intervened for fun. Context matters, even when it\u2019s inconvenient.\n\nPointing out that Turkish Cypriots were disproportionately targeted before 1974 isn\u2019t propaganda; it\u2019s fact. What *is* propaganda is minimizing their suffering while pretending Turkey acted entirely without cause. That level of selective history is beyond transparent.\n\nEOKA B wasn\u2019t some fringe group fighting against the Republic of Cyprus - it *overthrew it* in a Greek-backed coup. Even Makarios, who had already warned against *enosis*, wasn\u2019t safe from his own side. Trying to frame this as if the Greek Cypriot leadership wasn\u2019t complicit in the disaster that followed is pure revisionism.\n\nComparing Turkey\u2019s intervention to Nazi Germany invading Poland is as lazy as it is ridiculous. Stopping a military junta from annexing Cyprus is not remotely the same as orchestrating the Holocaust. If the goal is to have a serious discussion, maybe drop the sensationalist nonsense.\n\nClaiming that the Greek Junta\u2019s later trial somehow absolves them is absurd. They weren\u2019t stopped *before* they caused irreversible damage; they were dealt with *after* they threw Cyprus into chaos. Saying \u201cbut they were punished later\u201d doesn\u2019t erase the destruction they caused. \n\nBlaming TMT while ignoring the fact that the Greek Cypriot government itself was dismantling Turkish Cypriots\u2019 rights is a deliberate distortion of events. Coexistence ended the moment one side decided that a supposed democratic majority gave them the right to strip an entire ethnic group of protections.\n\nAnd if you actually read anything I\u2019ve written, you\u2019d know I think Turkey\u2019s actions since 1974 are indefensible and amount to nothing short of genocide. You'd also know that I think that Turkey were always looking for an excuse to invade - as evidence by the fact they never fucked off and sent in their settlers. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Greek Cypriots laid the groundwork for everything that happened. Pretending that the coup and the decade of violence before it didn\u2019t directly lead to the invasion is pure historical amnesia.\n\nAlso, I'm not Turkish, you idiot. Perhaps you need to stop reading and watching so much propaganda yourself if you believe anyone who disagrees with your distorted version of reality is simply \"brainwashed\".",

Despite the regional government being explicitly pro-Russian and essentially agreeing to the annexation, even half of the Ukrainian army stationed in Crimea immediately defected to Russia. In prior elections Crimea voted overwhelmingly for pro-Russian parties, and most experts seem to think that although the referendum to join Russia wasn't legitimate, it didn't really need much fraud to get the result Russia wanted out of it. Many would not like that to be the case, but that doesn't change the fact.\n\n>contrary to turkish cypriots who are mostly in support of Turkey\n\nThat's also false. Most Turkish Cypriots seem to support union with Cyprus and the EU, but Turkey prevents this.\n\nIn any case, the fact is that Crimeans are still the population of Crimea, while Turkish Cypriots are a minority in Northern Cyprus. Also, Turkish Cypriots themselves are not the original population of Northern Cyprus. It had a Greek majority before it was depopulated after the invasion and sparcely resettled by Turkish Cypriots from the entire island and Turks from the mainland.\n\nSo on one hand you have a state politically wrestling control of a territory from another, and claiming to better represent the native population living there. This is what happened in Crimea. Whether this is true or not (the opinion of Crimeans) isn't as important here.\n\nBecause on the other hand you have Turkey, which never claimed to represent the natives of the region it conquered. The area was immediately depopulated of the vast majority of its population, leaving the small minority of Turkish Cypriots who lived there as the only ones left, who then themselves became a minority through settlers.\n\nIt would be more similar to Russia not taking over Crimea, which was largely ethnically Russian and pro-Russian beforehand, but instead Sumy Oblast, killing or expelling all Ukrainians and keeping the 10% of the region that was already Russian, and then resettling the barren areas with people from other parts of Russia.\n\n>Any source for this?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_settlers_in_Northern_Cyprus",

Its population has mostly remained the same since the invasion. It was mostly Russian before Putin invaded. Putin wasn't alive in the early 1800's, when Tatars were the plurality.\n\nAlright so very short history lesson. Crimea was populated by Tatars and Greeks in the early 1800's, and very sparsely at that.  It was taken from the Ottoman Empire by the Russian Empire in the late 1700's, and by the late 1800's, it was filled with Russian and Ukrainian settlers, both supported by the Russian Empire. Since then it has always had a Russian majority. By the time of Stalin's deportations (which affected pretty much everyone, also Crimean Greeks and a bunch of other nationalities everywhere), Crimean Tatars were already a minority, not because they were expelled, but because the Russian and Ukrainian settlers in the previously uninhabited parts of Crimea outnumbered them.",

Even the wildly pro-Turkish Annan plan would have the Turkish military still on the island. It isn't temporary. It's an occupation force.\n\n>Turkish Cypriots are native to Cyprus, their existence in the north should not be seen as a disturbance and them being in the north is not their fault either.\n\nThey are now a minority in the North, and them being there isn't what made Turks in general the majority in the North, it was the ethnic cleansing of all other groups. Even if all the Turkish Cypriots, and all the Turkish settlers, concetrated in the North, without the ethnic cleansing of the Greeks, the Greeks would still be the clear majority.\n\nIt's like saying that after the post-2014 persecution of Russians in Ukraine, Russia would be justified to take over half the country, kick out the Ukrainians and have the Ukrainian Russians as well as new Russian Russians occupy the area. Which would be worse than what it has already done, but the comparatively tamer stuff is doing now is unjustified but somehow Turkey doing exactly that isn't?",

The ottoman state set up massive population transfers to control areas. \n\nTurks are objectively the invaders in cyprus. The turkish government is still trying to control Cyprus, even centuries later they wont let it be free. No amount of Turkish propaganda will change that.",

In what condition an invader becames a native or can they never become native. Is  it state involment. How big that state must be so this rule can apply? Is it years passed? If so how long? Or how many generations?\n\nYou are not answering this.\n\nHow finns are not invaders. English and Germans, are they native? What about south americans? Are they invaders even though they are living there for centuries( less than turkish cypriots lol). State sponsored and mega church organization sponsored if that is the condition. Does nativeness only apply if you have \"native dna\". So big portion of brazilians are invaders and only small percantage of them have actual right to live there. Is Eugenics most important thing then?\n\nIf you must be living in the same land since historical records to be a native then i can understand your position. Turkish cypriots are invaders, like anotolian turks. And most of greek cypriots. And almost all european nations and americans. Then can you admit finns are not native people and invaders as well?",

Everyone, including Greece accepts that the first intervention by the Turks was justified. However after EOKA B was stopped, the military junta in Greece had fallen and they were in the middle of peace talks, Turkey invaded and captured 1/3rd of the island. That invasion is not justified.\n\nThat's why noone in the world (apart from Turkey) recognizes Northern Cyprus as a separate country.\n\n\nYou probably should read a bit into it instead of posting about memes.\n\n>and let Cyprus choose its future.\n\nThat's exactly what I advocate as well. Both Greece and Turkey should fuck off and let Cypriots be independent.

Gee, and I thought Turkish tanks were just drifting there to blow of some steam. Of course it is an occupation, since it was not solved on the Geneva talks 50 years ago. Why would the army who has won the military conflict back out, when it can ensure its objectives? \n\nAnd again you are parroting what Greece has said, \u201cAnnan plan is unfair for Greeks\u201d. Why would it be fair? Greeks lost that military conflict and do not have the slightest chance to unite the island economywise or militarywise. So why would they hope for terms that favor them with \u201cthe illegal invader\u201d who is happy with status quo? Are you out of a grip for a reality? Of course the terms will favor Turkey\u2019s demands just like on the first round of Geneva talks after which Greece backed out of and Turkey invaded to ensure its objectives are secured.",

If the Greek Cypriots aren't willing to be flexible on that, then there's zero point in trying to resuscitate a cadaver. Annan failed partially because of that. Every other issue around this can be solved somehow, except for kicking out 100,000 people off the island.\n\nNot that I blame the Greek Cypriots for not agreeing to become a minority in their united country. There's still a lot of mistrust and animosity between both sides and reunification won't solve any of that, whether the settlers remain or leave. Until we reach one day where humanity will outgrow its nationalism phase (or enter/return into a neofeudal age or something of that sort) - the Cypriot question will remain unanswered.",

It's a book by a UK journalist talking about how WW2 is viewed by the British public, but I think a lot of the points he makes in the book are relevant to Europe as whole.\n\nSpecifically, one of Hitchens's arguments is that in the West, we've created a myth where WW2 was a great effort against evil - where countries didn't fight for their own interest, but to repel the genocidal, antisemitic evil Nazis. Partially because of this myth, and partially because of post-WW2 condemnation of colonialism & imperialism, wars of self-interest have become extremely unpopular with the general populace; there must always be some moral justification for any military action (e.g. the alleged chemical weaponry in Iraq). As you say, this leads to a certain \"prudishness\" where western democracies are afraid of any action that might be seen as self-serving, even though arguably the whole point of having a country is for it to care for its own people first and foremost.",

I've felt for a long time that the Myth or Legend of World War Two has ironically replaced many of the functions that religion used to have in Europe: It defines good and evil, and it's mainly used as a tool to identify who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\".\n\nThere was an interesting research project at the university where I studied history; *\"Levande Historia\"* (\"Living history\"). The goal was for politicians to invest in a lot of research into World War 2 and keeping the memory of the conflict alive.\n\nWhat many politicians and journalists didn't listen to is that the professor who led the project and many of his scions devoted a lot of their time critically analyzing *the memory* of World War 2 and what he sometimes radically identified as \"the cult of memory\". I participated in a lecture where I heard this soon-to-be-retired professor ask *WHY* Sweden has become so invested in World War 2 half a century after its conclusion, and *WHY* we are so eager to put ourselves \"on the winning side\" despite never having participated?\n\nAnd this obsession with moral \"purity\" is just getting stronger in Sweden, IMO. Nowadays, there are many here who are convinced that Sweden was in fact \"cheering\" on Nazi Germany from the sidelines, because of the steel trade and because of our dabbling in eugenics. People are unable to understand the neutral stance and that the Swedish government literally only cared about the survival of Sweden. They're unable to understand that eugenics was seen as cutting-edge science by all except the Soviet Bloc in the 1940s, they're unable to understand the position of neutrality. Sweden HAS to be sorted in to either of two categories: The Good Guys or The Bad Guys, and there is no third option.\n\n>even though arguably the whole point of having a country is for it to care for its own people first and foremost\n\nThis sentiment is extremely controversial to an exhausting number of people, btw.\n\nAlso, isn't Peter Hitchens the brother of Christopher Hitchens?",

And the members of the alliance, including my country, answered the call by sending thousands of troops in Afghanistan and then in Iraq. Two pointless wars that costed my country the life of brave men and women for what? Literally nothing, just a pile of body and debt to be repaid by us.\n\nWe stayed faithful to the US, but just look at the current US administration. Everything suggests that the US committment to the alliance will fade away in the next years. Just look at Trump's speech, calling the Baltics (outstanding and truthful members of the alliance) a Russian province. \n\nHow can the eastern countries of the alliance be sure that the US will answer the call for article 5 in case of a Russian aggression given the current narrative coming out from the White House?\n\nAn alliance is not built only by actions, but it needs to be a single and strong choir. Trump's speeches are undermining the alliance more than everybody thinks. Tyramnts and dictators across the world now see how fructured and weak the west has become.",

It was meant for refugees from neighboring countries.",

It was made legitimate through the ages. 150 years later it was still in Russian hands (tho Germany did occupy during ww2) \n\n2.) I think people overestimate the value of Crimea to turkey/ottomans compared to Russia. The ottomans did not need Crimea. They probably didn't want Russia to have it, but it wasn't an area of vital importance to the development of their empire like it would be to Russia, who lacked warm naval ports year round before they got black sea access. \n\nI don't see any reason why turkey wouldn't have seen Crimea as Russian, atleast prior to the fall of the ussr. I guess turkey could have made the political move and said it was Russian *after the fall* had they wanted to be closer to Russia, but there wasn't a real reason to.\n\n\nTldr ownership is political and it never really comes up again in history atleast til now I guess.

If Cypriots break treaties between Turks within K\u0131br\u0131s and call in the armies of Greece to fight back against British armies thats all well but a line was crossed during 1963.  If Greece wishes to keep the lands then there must be something brought to the at an table equal value of the blood of the Turks that were murdered/displaced alongside the lands, just as the expectations of the world with the Ottoman Empire's Armenian Genocides of 1915. It's either the Ottoman Empire's actions do not pertain to Turkey, which means the atrocities committed by them are not Turkey's concern or Ottoman Empire's actions do pertain to Turkey, in which case Turkey absolutely has a say over K\u0131br\u0131s. Instead what the world preaches is Turkey both holds no rights over K\u0131br\u0131s and yet are responsible for the genocides committed by the Ottoman Empire. Nothing will get resolved until Greece/UN comes to the table considering any of this. Its not revenge, its not vengence, its a country not letting the world walk all over them on all fronts.\n\n\nMind you, as far as I'm concerned its better to not bother with K\u0131br\u0131s and to just distance ourselves from this entire ordeal. I see Greece as our siblings and regardless of whatever people might say in this sub I know there are Greek people who see Turks the same. Our cultures are very much alligned, from our songs to our foods we are very similar. I am just not naive enough to expect things to be that simple with the history of what the subject of the matter is.",

The Turkish college students (medical school) I was part of were excited for a war against Russia.\u00a0\n\nThey were shocked and baffled when the United States and EU turned its back on Turkey. All sides blamed Turkey for standing up-to our common enemy at the time.\u00a0\n\nSo Turkey can never do good in the eyes of the West. Not when they stand against Russia, not when they supply Ukraine (Don\u2019t provoke Russia!), not when they protect minorities in Cyprus when the EU would do nothing for the muslims being massacred by the Greeks. Always a new reason to shit on the Turks. Fun. Moving the goalposts is easy.\u00a0\n\nThey held back nearly 4-7 million Syrians. Deposed Asad and took down a major Russian ally. They defeated the Russians in Libya (where France supported Haftar an old Gadaffi era warlord general), they ended the frozen conflict in Azerbaijan/Armenia.\u00a0\n\nYet all Europe has done is \u201cStrongly\u201d condemn Russia. I bet Brussels will condemn Russia with very strongly worded telegraphs when Russian armies one day will land troops in the outskirts of the Netherlands after they are done with all of central and eastern Europe.\u00a0",

Well, cry me a river. \n\nWhether you trust Turkey or not, we have had the balls to stand against Russia this century (and the century before that and the century before that), not with sanctions or by arming Ukraine, but with actual fighting.\n\nAnd you're right about we have our own angle that comes first because we don't trust you, either.

Amd you're still leaving out the part about the second invasion of Turkey \n\n> On 23 July 1974 the Greek military junta collapsed mainly because of the events in Cyprus. Greek political leaders in exile started returning to the country. On 24 July 1974 Constantine Karamanlis returned from Paris and was sworn in as Prime Minister. He kept Greece from entering the war, an act that was highly criticised as an act of treason. Shortly after this Nikos Sampson renounced the presidency and Glafcos Clerides temporarily took the role of president.[112]\n\n> The first round of peace talks took place in Geneva, Switzerland between 25 and 30 July 1974, James Callaghan, the British Foreign Secretary, having summoned a conference of the three guarantor powers. There they issued a declaration that the Turkish occupation zone should not be extended, that the Turkish enclaves should immediately be evacuated by the Greeks, and that a further conference should be held at Geneva with the two Cypriot communities present to restore peace and re-establish constitutional government. In advance of this they made two observations, one upholding the 1960 constitution, the other appearing to abandon it. They called for the Turkish Vice-President to resume his functions, but they also noted 'the existence in practice of two autonomous administrations, that of the Greek Cypriot community and that of the Turkish Cypriot community'.\n\n> By the time that the second Geneva conference met on 14 August 1974, international sympathy (which had been with the Turks in their first attack) was swinging back towards Greece now that it had restored democracy. At the second round of peace talks, Turkey demanded that the Cypriot government accept its plan for a federal state, and population transfer.[113] When the Cypriot acting president Clerides asked for 36 to 48 hours in order to consult with Athens and with Greek Cypriot leaders, the Turkish Foreign Minister denied Clerides that opportunity on the grounds that Makarios and others would use it to play for more time.[114]\n\n> Second Turkish invasion, 14\u201316 August 1974\n\n> Map showing the division of Cyprus\nThe Turkish Foreign Minister Turan G\u00fcne\u015f had said to the Prime Minister B\u00fclent Ecevit, \"When I say 'Ay\u015fe[b] should go on vacation' (Turkish: \"Ay\u015fe Tatile \u00c7\u0131ks\u0131n\"), it will mean that our armed forces are ready to go into action. Even if the telephone line is tapped, that would rouse no suspicion.\"[116] An hour and a half after the conference broke up, Turan G\u00fcne\u015f called Ecevit and said the code phrase. On 14 August Turkey launched its \"Second Peace Operation\", which eventually resulted in the Turkish occupation of 37% of Cyprus. Turkish occupation reached as far south as the Louroujina Salient.\n\n> **In the process, many Greek Cypriots became refugees. The number of refugees is estimated to be between 140,000 and 160,000**",

''H\u00fck\u00fcmet'' translates directly to government but we use it to refer to the ruling party or the coalition and their hold of power, not to the Parliament and the representatives elected by the people. In that, you didn't have to refer to a link of Arabs in Knesset because I already knew of their existence.\n\nOn the same note, do you think Turkey should crack down on HDP's pro-PKK rhetoric since it is a terrorist organization? But when we did that, I remember seeing lots of stuff here on this subreddit and almost definitely the ones you frequent chastising Turkey?\n\nSo instead Turkey decided to bury the hatchet.. Lately we've been in talks with PKK's leader \u00d6calan. Meanwhile Israel is in the process of flattening more buildings in Gaza. What was the latest death toll now, 400 since the last breach of the ceasefire by Israel?\n\nI do think that Israel goes far and beyond of just blocking pro-Hamas rhetoric given how they are acting in the West Bank with their illegal settlements. The equation to Nazi Germany is unwarranted here because the power dynamics and intentions are highly different.",

I will say that if you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the party itself is endeavoring through material support or advocacy of acts of terrorism that seek to undermine the integrity of state, act such as killing civilians or unilaterally taking action to secede, the MPs responsible should be charged with sedition, insurrection or rebellion (whichever fits the specifics of the case). As has happened in [2017 in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_declaration_of_independence#30%E2%80%9331_October:_Suspending_declaration_of_independence) where Catalan declaration of independence was deemed unconstitutional and members of the Catalan cabinet responsible charged with sedition (after which they fled to Belgium)\n\nI am against the West Bank settlements, I mostly talk about the governance structure. Hamas are terrorists that want to commit extermination though, so I think it is warranted despite power dynamics memes (their leaders all were ultra rich btw). Trying to have better relations with Palestinian  Authority or people like Mustafa Barghouti is not sanctioned in the Israeli Parliament, as PA is a legitimate governing body, and they are not terrorists.",

Once Hamas is gone, I am of the idea that the next batch of bad guys will be the ones in the West Bank. They are already raiding houses left and right in the West Bank. \n\n  \nBut the word terrorist means nothing anyways. A few months back HTS were terrorists, Al-Qaeda remnants.. Now their head is literally attending meetings with EU lawmakers and whatnot, trying to lift the sanctions on the country. Hakan Fidan, another Kurd in the cabinet btw, recently met with him despite still having his organization on the terrorist list.\n\nHamas rolling up on random civilians, taking them hostage as bargaining chips is terrorism, same with the Israeli general admitting to paying no mind to targeting a refugee camp with the suspicions of a Hamas member being there, effectively killing dozens of civilians. Or arming illegal settlers with arms so that they can terrorize random ass Palestinians in the West Bank. \n\nThe word shouldn't hold any weight in this day and age. It is bastardized to no end.",

Agreed on that? \n\nIt's Turkey that has to give something up. Nobody needs to trust Turkey for this to work. \n\nWhat's done is done, and in the past. We're just handed the baggage. Realistically if Turkey leaves, Cyprus breaks out in a civil war. That is the real problem here, beyond petty politics.

All their sanctions are lifted. They keep Crimea, because that was in 2014. They keep Donetsk and Luhansk. They just leave the most recent territories they occupied, and in return they get to be a part of Europe once again, all sins forgiven, free to gear up for another invasion. Would Europe take that deal? \n\nNo, right? There is an understanding that, even if Russia were to give up and leave, they must pay for what they have done. They can't say \"oops, this didn't work\", retreat, and replan their approach until it does work. \n\nThat is Turkey's take on Cyprus. The Zurich agreement decrees that Cyprus is neither a Greek state nor a Turkish one - it is a unique entity with special provisions to ensure that the rights of each population are respected. Both Makarios and Ioannidis violated this agreement, the former by blocking Turkish Cypriots from governing, and the latter by outright declaring the end of the Republic of Cyprus and its annexation by Greece. Turkey had no appetite for war, and only entered Cyprus in these dire circumstances. \n\nAnd in the aftermath, seeing Europe do nothing to punish Greece and Greek Cypriots over this transgression, essentially forgiving them and affording them another try to take the island later, the Turkish military decided that they would not return to the status quo - that half of the island would be held in escrow until the Greek parties agreed to a suitable penalty. This arrangement was tacitly approved by NATO. You might recall that the Greeks called for NATO support over Cyprus, were rebuffed, and semi-quit the organization in protest. \n\nHence the Annan plan: because the Greeks violated Zurich, they must now offer something better for the Turks than Zurich. Of course it is extremely pro-Turkish, that is by design. If the Greeks find this unpalatable, too bad - try not getting couped by a military junta and annexing an island over irredentist nonsense next time.",

Because history says there were literally no massacres for the entire time the Junta was in power, partly in order to avoid justifying a Turkish invasion, which took place anyway.\n\n>It was the reason why USA supported Turkey at the beginning\n\nThe Cypriot government supported the invasion initially too. We are literally talking about the first couple of days though. It became apparent very soon that Turkish goal was conquest. If Turkey left after the first couple of days, when the legitimate government was restored, that would have been that. Instead, what happened was that Turkey invaded the legitimate government with pure conquest as its goal.\n\nThe whole coup justification becomes moot when you know that all this took place within literal days, and the actual invasion and ethnic cleansing took place following it, with Cyprus being invaded while headed by the legitimate government.

Yes they later turned into a political organisation, and they killed more Leftist Greeks than they ever did Turks. In any case, the total amount of deaths over the whole period was in the few hundreds, paling in comparison to the casualties of the invasion.

And I don't see how this would justify it at all. If Denmark asks the USA military based there to help with a terrorist attack, and then they just take over the country and turn it into the 51st state, the fact the legitimate Danish government invited them to do something completely different doesn't justify the annexation.",
