    "selftext": "\nThis megathread is meant for discussion of the current **Russo-Ukrainian War**, also known as the **Russian invasion of Ukraine**. Please read our [current rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules), but also the extended rules below.\n\n# News sources:\n\n- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance)\n\n- [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine).\n\n- [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60525350)\n\n- [Al Jazeera English](https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/)\n\n- [Financial Times \"War in Ukraine\" section](https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine)\n\nYou can also get up-to-date information and news from the [r/worldnews live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs), which are more up-to-date tweets about the situation.\n\n### **Current rules extension:**\n \nExtended [r/europe ruleset](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules) to curb hate speech and disinformation:\n\n- While we already ban hate speech, we'll remind you that hate speech against the civilians of the combatants is against our rules, including but not limited to Ukrainians, **Russians**, Belarusians, Syrians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, etc. The same applies to the population of countries actively helping Ukraine or Russia.\n\n- **Calling for the killing of invading troops or leaders is allowed, but the mods have the discretion to remove egregious comments**, and the ones that disrespect the point made above. The limits of international law apply. \n\n- **No unverified reports of any kind in the comments or in submissions on r/europe**. We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.\n\n- **Absolutely no justification of this invasion**.\n\n- In addition to our rules, **we ask you to add a NSFW/NSFL tag if you're going to link to graphic footage** or anything can be considered upsetting, including combat footage or dead people.\n\n### Submission rules\n\nThese are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.\n\t\n- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. \"City X still holding\" would not be allowed, \"Russia takes major city\" would be allowed. \"Major attack on Kherson repelled\" would also be allowed.)\n\n- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.\n  - Some Russian sites that ends with `.com` are also hardspammed, like TASS and Interfax, and mods can't re-approve them.\n    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.\n- We've been adding substack domains in our u/AutoModerator script, but we aren't banning all of them. If your link has been removed, please notify the moderation team, explaining who's the person managing that substack page.\n- We ask you or your organization to not spam our subreddit with petitions or promote their new non-profit organization. While we love that people are pouring all sorts of efforts on the civilian front, we're limited on checking these links to prevent scam.\n- No promotion of a new cryptocurrency or web3 project, other than the official Bitcoin and ETH addresses from Ukraine's government.\n\n### META\n\n[**Link to the previous Megathread LVII (57)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1bkysju/war_in_ukraine_megathread_lvi_57/)\n\n**Questions and Feedback**: You can send feedback via r/EuropeMeta or via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/europe).\n\n---\n \n**Donations:**\n\nIf you want to donate to Ukraine, check [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/t03lml/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/) or [this fundraising account by the Ukrainian national bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/ukrainewar#wiki_donations). \n\n---\n\n**Fleeing Ukraine**\nWe have set up a wiki page with the available information about the border situation for Ukraine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/ukrainewar).

A US against Ukraine will lead to massive increase in defence spending which will lead to big cuts, tax increases or deficits.

If Europe started talking about attacking Russia it would just play into Putin's hands because Putin has been trying to convince his people that the West wants to destroy Russia and that this is a defensive war against the Evil West. We must not enforce that lie. Especially when we don't actually want to attack. We should never say things we don't mean and can't fully stand behind.\n\n**Self-defense minded** deterrence is still the correct path and the key. **Not** aggression. **Finland is living proof** of that high level and constantly maintained readiness in both military means and sociatal preparedness works against Russian aggression--Russia has not attacked Finland in 85 years, even when 83 of those years Finland was not in any military alliance and has no nukes either. Finland has also maintained high level of military aid for Ukraine all along, without Russia doing anything about it. Sure there's been some sabotage of underwater cables and whatnot, but Russia has not been bold enough to directly or militarily attack. **Decisive conventional SELF-DEFENSE works. No need for risky aggressive rhetoric.**\n\nWhat Eutope needs to do is strongly and finally state that we don't trust the US government at all and we don't need them, and that we will massively increase our military capabilities, and military aid for Ukraine for as long as Ukraine wants to fight. And then actually do all that in decisive and fast manner.",

For several reasons:\n\n**1. Trump is not loyal to Putin\u2014just a useful idiot.**\n\n* Even Russian state-run media has openly admitted that they do not trust Trump.\n* Putin sees Trump as an unstable opportunist who could betray Russia at any moment if it benefits him personally.\n* Trump is self-serving first, **not a reliable Russian asset.**\n\n**2. Most of the U.S. government, military, and public still see Russia as the enemy.**\n\n* Russia has pointed nukes at the U.S. for nearly 80 years.\n* Even inside MAGA, there are many who still view Russia as an adversary\u2014they just don\u2019t prioritize stopping them over domestic issues.\n* The FBI, CIA, Pentagon, and entire U.S. intelligence community **have spent decades countering Russian threats**\u2014this isn\u2019t something that would suddenly vanish.\n\n**3. The U.S. military would NEVER take orders from Putin or attack Europe.**\n\n* The U.S. military swears **an oath to the Constitution, not to any President**\u2014and certainly not to a foreign dictator.\n* They are legally and structurally obligated to reject unlawful or unconstitutional orders.\n* Even Trump couldn\u2019t get the military to do whatever he wanted during his first presidency\u2014his own generals pushed back against him multiple times.\n* A scenario where the U.S. military turns on NATO allies to fight alongside Russia is outright **impossible.**\n\n**4. Russia doesn\u2019t have the strength or ability to \"siphon\" U.S. resources.**\n\n* Russia\u2019s **economy is collapsing** and depends on China to stay afloat. It cannot economically absorb or exploit the U.S.\n* The U.S. Congress, businesses, and state governments would resist any move to funnel resources to Russia.\n* Trump may try to cut aid to Ukraine, but actually redirecting U.S. military resources to benefit Russia **would be met with massive resistance** from all levels of government and society.\n\n**5. Threatening Russia with invasion would be a massive strategic mistake.**\n\n* Putin has been trying to convince Russians that \"the West wants to destroy Russia.\"\n* If Europe started talking about attacking Russia, **it would hand Putin the perfect excuse to escalate the war.**\n* **Wars are started based on confidence in victory.** No country will invade unless it believes it will win. Russia invaded Ukraine because it thought Ukraine was weak.\n* The best way to prevent war is not to threaten aggression, but to **make sure Russia knows it has zero chance of success.**\n* **Putin respects strength, not threats.** The moment he believes an attack will fail, he won\u2019t attempt it.\n\n**What Europe needs is overwhelming military strength, economic resilience, and unconditional military aid to Ukraine. THAT is how we win.** Talking about attacking Russia is reckless, unnecessary, and counterproductive.",

The reason Putin is so obsessed with taking Ukraine now, is that he's dead if he fails to take any territory. There's no way he would maintain control of the Russian elites with that much of a display of failure. Which implies Russia is already coming out of the war with a blue eye and or a loss, *even if* they take territory. Heck, they just lost Syria and also their influence in Azerbaijan. Not even accounting damages to Russia's economy and the long-term damage to their population (the deaths + brain drain). And don't forget the general geopolitical damage Russia did by demonstrating how it's own military is a joke that was held up by misinformation alone. If it ever had any intentions on claiming to be a superpower, it's failure in Ukraine settled that question, and there's no real coming back from that.\n\nIf Russia does get parts of Ukraine, it'll still be a net loss, just with a silver lining that can be propagandized into claiming victory.\n\nMind you, this still means we should make sure Russia doesn't even get that silver lining.",

What he actually wanted was war\u2014his goal was to conquer all of Czechoslovakia by force as a first step toward the conquest of all of Europe.\n\nHe didn\u2019t imagine that the British and French governments would be so craven as to give him everything he publicly asked for, including the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and the occupation of the Sudetenland by the German army. When they did, Hitler found himself trapped into accepting, but he was unhappy. Within five months he ordered the military occupation of all Czechoslovakia, in violation of the Munich Agreement, and six months after that, he invaded Poland.\n\nToday the Trump administration is offering Vladimir Putin a Munich-like settlement for Ukraine. Trump\u2019s negotiators have offered Putin almost everything he has publicly asked for without demanding anything in return. They may assume that if they give him everything up front, he will agree to a cease-fire and some kind of deal that will save face for President Donald Trump, allowing him to claim the mantle of peacemaker, just as Chamberlain did, albeit for only a few months.\n\n(...)\n\nEveryone in the West seems to agree that there will be a cease-fire in Ukraine at some point. But one person who never talks about a cease-fire is Vladimir Putin. He does not talk about a cease-fire with his own people. He has at no time offered a cease-fire to the Ukrainians or the Americans. People assume he wants a cease-fire because his losses are staggering and his economy is suffering. But, as I and others have argued, Putin has to believe only that Ukraine is closer to collapse than he is, and that though he is suffering, the Ukrainians are suffering more. Trump\u2019s latest moves to paralyze Ukraine\u2019s defenses against missile and drone attacks by denying vital U.S. intelligence sharing can only bolster that assessment.\n\nPutin might be tempted to strike a Munich-like deal with Trump just to strengthen an American president who seems determined to give Putin what he may never have imagined possible\u2014a complete American capitulation in the global struggle, the destruction of the NATO alliance, the isolation of a weak Europe, and an open field for further actions to fulfill Putin\u2019s overarching goal, which is the reconstitution of the Soviet Union and its empire in Eastern and Central Europe. This is where the Munich analogy breaks down, because whatever else Chamberlain\u2019s appeasement was, it did not include changing sides in the ongoing European crisis and joining Hitler to carve up the continent.\n\nYet Putin may calculate that he is getting that for free already. The damage Trump has done to NATO is probably irreparable. The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least. But Trump is mercurial and could reverse course, at least partially, at any time. That\u2019s a reason for Putin to seek victory as quickly as possible. He may never have a chance as good as this one to complete the task he set out to achieve when he launched his invasion three years ago.\n\nOne thing is certain: Trump is no poker player. Thanks to his actions so far, Putin hasn\u2019t had to reveal any of his cards. Trump claims to know what Putin wants, but his own actions show that he actually has no clue. One day Trump says Russia wants peace for reasons \u201conly I know.\u201d The next, he warns Putin that he\u2019ll impose more sanctions. Putin must be laughing up his sleeve. He\u2019s weathered American sanctions for the better part of three years now; more of the same is not much of a threat. If that\u2019s the only card Trump intends to play, Putin will soon be cashing in, and Ukraine will soon be doomed. Neville Chamberlain believed that Hitler wouldn\u2019t violate the Munich deal because Hitler respected him. Trump shares that delusion about Putin. We may all pay the price.",

Europe needs to act radically now to make sure Ukraine survives these next four years and hope the next US president can catapult this war into complete defeat for Russia (Ukraine regains all territory and there's a lasting, enforced peace). Some steps Europe can take:\n\n* Create a pro-Ukraine alliance group where nations can effectively pool and direct resources based on what is most damaging against Russia on the battlefield. This also means nations willing to share capabilities in cyber attacks and irregular conflict against Russian infrastructure.\n* Offer major political, military and economic incentives (e.g. favourable arms deals, removal of trade barriers, building nuclear plants) to non-EU nations like Turkey, Gulf states, Syria etc. to help Ukraine's war effort and implement targeted sanctions.\n* Take down Russia's infrastructure: internet, oil/gas facilities, electricity to damage their economy and military capability. Support separatist factions within Russia, militarily if possible. Keep doing this as long as Trump remains in power so Ukraine can survive during this period.\n* Send in military forces into Ukraine (can be declared/undeclared idgaf) to train Ukrainian forces and backfill fighters who are on the frontlines.

You would need a LOT of short range air defence systems to effectively defend important targets inside Russia against Ukrainian drones, and Russia doesn't have enough. https://x.com/JimmySecUK/status/1881305421224329239",

It\u2019s going to be a real test of unity,\u201d said one senior EU official.\n\n\u201cTrump sees us as money. And frankly we haven\u2019t been clear on what our seat at the table would look like in exchange for that money.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday evening, six European countries, including Germany, France and the UK, said they were ready to \u201cstrengthen our support for Ukraine\u201d, adding they were committed to its \u201cindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia\u2019s war of aggression\u201d.\n\nThe joint statement, which also involved the European Commission, added: \u201cWe want to discuss the way forward with our American allies . . . Ukraine and Europe must be involved in any negotiations.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s defence minister Boris Pistorius on Thursday expressed regret that Washington had granted public concessions to Moscow before the start of peace talks.\n\n\u201cWhat the negotiation results will look like is still unclear. It is unfortunate . . . that Trump has already made public concessions to Putin before negotiations have even begun,\u201d Pistorius said before a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. \u201cIt would have been better to talk about Ukraine\u2019s possible NATO membership first at the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that the threat from Russia may not abate after a peace accord.\n\n\u201cPutin is constantly provoking the west and attacking us again. It would be naive to believe the threat would actually be diminishing after such a peace agreement.\u201d\n\nEuropean leaders and ministers are hoping to extract more clarity on Trump\u2019s plans from discussions with US vice-president JD Vance and the president\u2019s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, at the Munich Security Conference, which begins on Friday.\n\nNato officials said they did not expect Kellogg to outline the US objectives for the negotiations in Munich, but would sound out European capitals in the weeks to come.\n\nCompounding the sense of disconnect for Europeans, Kellogg was not named by Trump as part of the negotiating team for peace talks with the Russian side.\n\nAs Trump announced the start of negotiations, foreign ministers from France, Germany, Poland, Spain and Italy met the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, in Paris to strategise their approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that . . . Europeans have a common understanding of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Spanish foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares told the FT.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than fair to say that nothing can be agreed about European security without Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t think that anything should be decided about Ukraine without Ukraine.\u201d",

A collective veto from Ukraine and Europe means there is no deal and it forces Trump into the awkward position of having to give Russia something (or everything) in exchange for nothing. \n\nHe doesn't care about looking a lickspittle to Moscow; but he does care about looking a chump. Ukraine and Europe have more leverage than the White House would like either of them to believe. https://x.com/michaeldweiss/status/1896915608601534593",

One European diplomat said: \u201cWe will know very soon if the US has set its face against helping Europe, and what its explanation is.\u201d\n\n(...)\n\nIn a sense, diplomats say, as with the eurozone crisis this is not just about money, or even transferring resources to spend more on defence over the next four years, critical as this will be. This is about political will, and taking the mental leap of independence from America. One western diplomat said: \u201cMacron was probably right in his talk of European strategic autonomy. We have wasted seven years not building a European defence capability, and now we must make up for lost time.\u201d\n\n(...)\n\nOne European diplomat said: \u201cWith Trump only putting pressure on Ukraine to negotiate, no questions have been asked of Putin\u2019s terms for a deal, and no pressure has been applied on him by the White House. It is outrageous.\u201d\n\n(...)\n\nAn additional proposal is to challenge Trump to sell to Europe the arms he is refusing to supply to Ukraine. If Washington rejected such a highly commercial offer it would reveal that Trump\u2019s concern was not the cost to the American budget of helping Ukraine, but something more geo-strategic.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/american-severance-may-be-averted-but-europes-leaders-must-fear-the-worst",

Contingency planning is ongoing for the unlikely scenario in which the US does turn its back on the alliance and pulls all troops out of Europe.\n\nThe continent largely disarmed after the Cold War and saw Russia as a basket case and then a trading partner.

You're just talking in bad faith here, just like in the other thread where you blatantly decided to go with ad hominem. My point is that constantly claiming to be a part of Ukrainian culture without defining what your Ukrainian culture is exactly, means nothing.\n\nSince the culture is not monolithic, some parts of it can be self-destructive. You can proudly claim to be a Ukrainian but so can a Donbas separatist. The claim doesn't inherently define what kind of Ukrainian you are, and what kind of culture you belong to. Being a part of self-destructive Ukrainian culture is bad and should be called out, but being a part of that culture doesn't necessarily mean you are also a part of Russian-speaker Ukrainian culture. Although there is certainly a correlation between the two because of multiple factors like being more susceptible to Russian propaganda or potentially having fewer consequences than Ukrainian speakers in the case of Russian occupation. You already claimed that this is simply about your survival, that's not exactly a moral high ground considering the possible consequences to other Ukrainians. And I personally think that you being a Russian speaker contributes to that position, although maybe it doesn't and you don't give a shit about Ukrainians in general and not only on a language basis. I don't know which one is worse, to be honest.",

But even if Russia halts advances and goes on the defensive, we lack the resources to reclaim territories to the 2022 borders, let alone the 1991 borders. This is due to many factors: delayed mobilization, insufficient aid, weak sanctions enforcement, a lack of political will in the West, poor military decisions, delayed aid due to de-escalation concerns, and the sheer reality of fighting a country with four times our population, with superior numbers in almost all domains and one of the largest military industries, supported by regimes like North Korea, which contribute more than some European countries with far larger GDPs.\n\nManpower shortages are another issue, but that's a separate discussion. Ukrainian leadership bears a good part of the responsibility for these problems. Still, if the West can\u2019t supply the 14 brigades Zelensky requested, why discuss drafting hundreds of thousands more? We need to completely re-arm way more existing brigades. Who\u2019s going to pay for them? Let\u2019s be honest - there\u2019s little enthusiasm in the U.S. or Europe to fund this.\n\nIf Russia retains its occupied territories, it will undermine one of Europe\u2019s core security principles: that borders cannot be redrawn by invading force. In 2014, Russia violated this order, leading to the 2022 invasion. This time, it\u2019s not just Ukraine that will have failed - it\u2019s Ukraine, the U.S., and Western Europe\u2019s failure to defeat Russia.\n\nSome might cite Finland's Winter War, as an example of what Ukraine should have done, but that war lasted three months and ended with Finland ceding territory, paying reparations in the form of machinery, and renting a port to the Soviets. Ukraine's demographics today are also very different: the 18-25 age group is among the smallest, a reality across modern Europe.\n\nUnless Ukraine and the West create a serious plan to radically increase aid to support mobilization - where Ukraine commits to mobilizing more people on the condition that they are properly armed and trained, and the West provides robust air defense to intercept missiles as decisively as the U.S. does for Israel - Ukraine will lose the war of attrition. This will force unfavorable peace, and mass migration from Ukraine to other countries, setting a dangerous precedent, and making it look like the West lost to Russia in the eyes of the world, especially among the enemies of the West https://x.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1846332987283030181",

After a dismal couple of weeks bracketing this week\u2019s third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the meeting in the White House opened about as badly as it could possibly have done. Instead of the world\u2019s biggest superpower being his friend, Ukraine\u2019s beleaguered leader now finds himself squeezed between US and Russian leaders who seem to agree more with each other than with him.\n\nThe backdrop was hardly propitious. The US had begun talks with Russia without inviting Kyiv. Trump had pressed Zelenskyy to agree an initially extortionate mineral-sharing deal, and called him a dictator. Washington had sided with Moscow to back a UN resolution on the war that did not criticise Russia. By the time the two men met, the minerals deal looked a little less like racketeering. But what is now clear is that the US has abandoned Ukraine.\n\nThe Zelenskyy team made what turned out to be several miscalculations. One was to offer the US a deal to share Ukraine\u2019s resources, as part of a broader \u201cvictory plan\u201d. This was meant to incentivise the White House to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand before any talks with Moscow and provide a postwar security backstop to deter further Russian aggression. The second was to set too much store by Trump\u2019s \u201cpeace through strength\u201d campaign slogan.\n\nKyiv underestimated Trump\u2019s ruthlessness in trying to extract as much as he could get from the minerals accord while giving so little of what Ukraine wanted in return. This week\u2019s final draft was less onerous than the first, but contained no security backdrop. The US president\u2019s assertion that the presence of US workers extracting metals and minerals in Ukraine would forestall further Russian onslaughts lacks credibility. Plenty of Americans and US companies were in Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nZelenskyy has learnt the hard way about the mindset and motivations of Trump 2.0. The first lesson is that \u2014 as also in the Middle East \u2014 for the president, \u201cpeace\u201d means the absence of fighting. He appears interested in a ceasefire that takes images of bloodshed off American TV screens and saves the US from stumping up costly military support. But he is less concerned with finding a lasting solution that will prevent the return of war.\n\nSecond, Trump is driven by the pursuit of economic gain. His approach is heavily influenced, too, by personal feelings. He clearly bears a grudge towards Zelenskyy, after Trump\u2019s 2019 effort to strong-arm Ukraine\u2019s leader into launching an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine in return for US aid led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment.\n\nYet he retains a baffling admiration for Vladimir Putin, whose language on the causes of the Ukraine conflict Trump has largely adopted. His indulgence of the Russian leader seems bound up with his quasi-19th-century worldview that global affairs should be directed not by multilateral institutions but by a handful of large powers and their strongman leaders, each with their sphere of influence.\n\nZelenskyy lacks the diplomatic talent of Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, the European leaders who managed to build some rapport with Trump in successful visits this week. But Zelenskyy also seemed to have been ambushed by a White House that ended up humiliating him. Three years since Russia invaded Ukraine, his struggle to secure the country\u2019s sovereignty has entered its most precarious phase.",

The country joined Nato last year, as a consequence of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has stepped up its military spending, reaching 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2024, above the alliance\u2019s target of 2 per cent.\n\n\u201cOne of the lessons learned from this war in Ukraine is that having a strong defence industrial base is part of credible deterrence,\u201d said Jonson.\n\nSaab, its main defence company which is controlled by the Wallenberg family of industrialists, may only be the eighth-largest such group in Europe but is unusual for producing fighter jets, submarines and other weapons. Sweden\u2019s Gripen fighter jet, its GlobalEye surveillance aeroplane and the Blekinge submarines all come from Saab.\n\nJonson added that many of the Swedish platforms delivered to Ukraine were well suited to it as they were easy to operate, adapted to use by conscripts, and were designed to confront Russian weapons.",

But what happens in Germany could be almost as important.\n\nThe Germans are the second-largest national aid donors to Ukraine, after the US, and they are central players in both the EU and Nato. But populist parties, sympathetic to Russia, are on the rise in Germany.\n\nThe Alternative for Germany party (AfD) almost won the elections in the state of Brandenburg on Sunday. This is the party\u2019s third strong performance in a row, after coming first in state elections in Thuringia and a close second in Saxony.\n\nCombine the AfD vote with that of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and something like a third of Germans \u2014 and many more in eastern Germany \u2014 are voting for populist parties that are militantly anti-migration, hostile to Nato and determined to cut off aid to Ukraine. When Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Bundestag in June, all but four of the AfD\u2019s 77 members boycotted his speech.\n\nThe policy stances taken by the AfD and BSW, combined with accusations that many AfD members have an undeclared agenda that is even more extremist, mean that Germany\u2019s traditional parties will refuse to go into coalition with the populists \u2014 at least at the national level. But the rise of the political extremes is already having an influence on government policies. Germany\u2019s decision to impose border controls with its EU neighbours reflects the angst about illegal migration that the populists have capitalised on.\n\nUkraine\u2019s supporters worry that the next policy adjustments will involve a softening of German support for Kyiv. The Ukrainian army is already struggling to hold off Russian forces in the east of the country and is running short of ammunition and troops. A decline in German and American support for Ukraine could help Russia to win the war.\n\nEven if Russian tanks do not roll into Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s supporters worry that the Zelenskyy government may soon be forced to make territorial concessions that would allow Vladimir Putin to claim victory. A bad peace deal could put Ukraine\u2019s future as a viable nation in doubt and embolden Putin to threaten other countries.\n\nUkraine\u2019s friends in Berlin see proliferating signs of a possible softening in German support. While Britain and the US are debating allowing Ukraine to use their long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, Germany has ruled out supplying its own Taurus missiles.\n\nGermany\u2019s finance minister, Christian Lindner, has said that there can be no further package of financial aid for Ukraine, without making politically impossible compensatory cuts in the budget. The EU\u2019s decision to mobilise some frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine has taken the financial pressure off Berlin for now. But the question of German financial aid is certain to return.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz is lagging badly behind in national polls and looks to be heading for defeat in next September\u2019s federal elections. Ukraine\u2019s most ardent supporters worry that Scholz may be tempted to try to revive his political fortunes, by launching a pre-election peace initiative with Russia.\n\nNervousness about what Scholz might be up to was reflected in rumours doing the rounds in Berlin last week that a contact group, composed of members of his Social Democratic party, was in Moscow for secret talks.\n\nThese suggestions were waved away in the chancellery. Scholz\u2019s key aides seem almost equally exasperated by the Russophile populists and by the hawks in Berlin that are demanding a sharp increase in aid for Kyiv. They see themselves as representing the moderate German middle on Ukraine. The government\u2019s task, as Scholz sees it, is to keep a divided country together around a basically pro-Ukraine policy.\n\nFor the Ukrainians, however \u2014 long frustrated by what they regard as the snail-like pace of German aid \u2014 any suggestion that the Scholz government may become even more cautious is dismaying. Hawks in Kyiv and Berlin argue that if Putin is not defeated in Ukraine, he will move on to threaten Nato and ultimately Germany itself.\n\nScholz and his allies insist that he is not naive about the threat posed by Putin. They see the daily evidence of Russian brutality in Ukraine, as well as sabotage and disinformation inside Germany itself. Over the long term, German analysts worry that Russia has now fully converted into an economy primed for war and weapons production. They note that some of the most advanced weaponry that Russia is churning out is not being used in Ukraine, but seems to be being stored for some possible future conflict.\n\nThe German chancellor knows all this. But political leaders live in the moment and their outlooks are almost invariably dominated by domestic politics. Scholz has a very difficult election ahead and would like to run as the peace candidate.\n\nHe is also based in Berlin \u2014 a city that has seen so much darkness and tragedy \u2014 but which now feels a long way from the front lines of Ukraine. Last week, the pavement bars and bike paths near the chancellor\u2019s office were full of people enjoying the late summer sunshine. The idea that dark times are returning to Europe is a hard thing for a government \u2014 or for a people \u2014 to face.",

Fico's threats to cut off Ukraine's emergency power supply this winter while Russia attacks our power plants and energy grid can only be explained by this.\n\nThe only reasons Ukraine now needs to import electricity are Russia's occupation of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and its use of missiles and \"Shahed\" drones to purposefully destroy a large portion of Ukraine's heat and hydroelectric power generation. \n\nThanks to the heroic efforts of our energy workers and the life-saving cooperation with the EU, the U.S., the UK, Norway, Japan, and other partners we have managed to prevent a blackout in Ukraine. And now Fico is dragging Slovakia into Russia's attempts to cause more suffering for Ukrainians.\n\nWe need to remind Fico of three things. \n\nFirst and foremost, supporting Russian aggression is completely immoral. \n\nSecond, Fico's shortsighted policy has already deprived the Slovak people of compensation for losing Russian gas transit. It now risks depriving the Slovaks of another $200 million per year, which Ukraine pays for the imported electricity. Yes, this critical import does not come free, and the cost is significant.\n\nThird, everyone in Europe, including the people of Slovakia, will find it much more profitable from every perspective to work with neighbours and the EU to increase Europe's energy resource supply, including gas from America and other partners. Only this can reduce energy costs for the majority of families.\n\nSlovakia's share of Ukraine's electricity imports is roughly 19%. The government of Ukraine is working with our EU neighbours to sustain the required volumes of electricity supply. \n\nSlovakia is part of the single European energy market and Fico must respect common European rules. Any arbitrary decisions in Bratislava or Moscow's orders to Fico regarding electricity cannot cut Ukraine's power supply, but they can certainly cut current Slovak authorities' ties to the European community. https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1872972924015005721",

Not everything has to be planned as bureaucratic 5-year plans. Not everything has to be prematurely optimized for a multi-decade shelf life.\n\n\nIt's actually embarrassing that Iran has provided Houthi rebels with more long-range precision missiles and drones than Europe has provided to Ukraine. Some of it is of course related to early wishes not to escalate. But a lot of it is due to small existing stockpiles of cruise missiles and a lack of agility like not being able to rapidly scale up manufacturing of a Storm Shadow variant that is not using expensive alloys and components optimized for a 25 year shelf life but instead optimized for price and manufacturability. This is actually what Iran did to be able to rapidly manufacture long-range precision missiles and drones to Houthis. For example the Iranian Toloue turbofan jet engine used in the anti-ship and anti-Israel cruise missiles they provided to Houthis is almost an exact copy of the 1980s Microturbo TRI 60 turbofan jet engine used by by the Storm Shadow. But the Iranian Toloue engine is much more optimized for price and manufacturability instead of using expensive alloys and components that are optimized for reliability over a 25 year shelf life.\n\n\nWhen it comes to believes and estimates about what it takes to bring complex technological systems to life there is one extreme made up of American techbros who think everything can be done in a two week sprint. But Europe is suffering from the other extreme of believing that nothing can be done fast and everything has the be done through slow bureaucratic 5-year plans.",

Ukrainian outlet Suspilne reported on September 18 that a source within Ukrainian special services stated that the Toropets facility stored Iskander missiles, Tochka-U ballistic missiles, glide bombs, and artillery ammunition.[2] It is unclear if Kiviselg's statement about 30,000 tons of explosives includes both missiles and artillery ammunition, but the strike destroyed significant Russian materiel stockpiles in any case. ISW continues to assess that continued Ukrainian strikes against rear Russian logistics facilities within Russia will generate wider operational pressures on the Russian military, including forcing the Russian military command to reorganize and disperse support and logistics systems within Russia to mitigate the impact of such strikes.[3]\n\nNote: If Kiviselg meant 10,000 shells per week, then Russian forces would use roughly over 100,000 shells in two and a half months whereas if Kiviselg meant 10,000 shells per day then Russian forces would use 750,000 shells in two and a half months. Kiviselg appears to have misspoken and meant to say that Russian forces use 10,000 shells per day, although ISW cannot confirm if this is the case. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-22-2024",

Otherwise you will live in the shadow of war permanently. This is the hour of Europe, because the US will do nothing.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Macron does not need to be convinced. In Europe, the conversation on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has brutally shifted. Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s opening towards a negotiated settlement have created a new, more volatile situation. Supporting Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d, the allies\u2019 mantra for almost three years, does lose credibility when the major partner leaves the chorus. Trump\u2019s willingness to end the war, while keeping the Europeans in the dark over how he intends to do so, poses an enormous challenge to the leaders of the continent.\n\nThe French president\u2019s worst nightmare, shared by many of his counterparts, is a Russian-American deal done over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans \u2014 an American diplomatic tradition which, to be fair, predates Trump. Macron scored an early victory when he set up a meeting between Zelenskyy and then president-elect Trump on the margins of the reopening of the newly restored Notre-Dame Cathedral in December. This conversation apparently helped Trump to realise that solving the problem would take more than 24 hours. European officials also point out, somehow reassuringly, that the US president has \u2014 so far \u2014 avoided hair-raising, Gaza-like scenarios about Ukraine. His line, they believe, has not yet been set, as Russian president Vladimir Putin still seems to think he can win this war. \n\nOne line they know to be clear, however, is that of American disengagement. There\u2019s no need to leave Nato \u2014 Trump just does not want his country to be burdened with a war in Ukraine. If Europe wants a seat at the negotiating table, it must have something to put on it so that its interests are taken into account regarding not only the terms of the deal but also its implementation. A deal that may look good to Trump because it stops the slaughter of \u201cyoung, beautiful people\u201d will not be a good deal for Europe if it does not prevent Putin from attacking Ukraine again. From a European point of view, strong security guarantees for Kyiv are therefore key to any agreement.\n\nThis is where things get painful for countries that for decades have outsourced their security to the US and now belatedly realise that this guarantee is gone. A \u201cvery dynamic debate\u201d is going on, according to a European official, about what security guarantees would be necessary. Among the most determined countries in this debate \u2014 which includes Poland, the Baltics, Sweden and Finland \u2014 France is trying to play a leading role, though in a new, unfamiliar mode: by rallying others and keeping the different pieces of the puzzle together rather than by playing its own card.\n\nNew formats, outside the EU if need be, such as adding Italy and the UK to the \u201cWeimar triangle\u201d of France, Germany and Poland, have been put to work. Humbled by the adverse reaction a year ago to his surprise proposal for putting western \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Ukraine, Macron, who is presumably also aware of his weakened position on the European scene due to his domestic political and economic travails, has some work to do to regain his partners\u2019 trust.\n\nYet France is in a singular position when it comes to facing an American president who may behave more as an adversary than as an ally. For some Europeans, particularly those most exposed to the Russian threat, the possibility of the fall of Ukraine is a terrifying prospect, as they would find themselves next in line. The temptation to try to keep American protection at any cost would therefore run counter to the effort of building a strong European defence capability. France does not share the same sensitivity because it feels protected by its own independent nuclear deterrent.\n\nSnyder\u2019s words at the Sorbonne echo those of Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary-general, who warned members of the European parliament last month that if EU member states do not drastically increase their defence spending, the only options left to them will be to learn Russian or move to New Zealand. Caught between Putin and Trump, Europeans are finally facing the reality they have tried to escape for so long.",

The problem is, we simply do not know what was discussed and what was agreed in that \"lengthy and highly productive\" 90-minute phone call that Donald Trump suddenly announced he\u2019d held last month with the Russian President.\n\nSo far, Vladimir Putin has played a clever hand, sitting back and doubtless enjoying watching the transatlantic alliance come apart at the seams.\n\nCompared to that gain, the threat of US tariffs is unlikely to bother him unduly. https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cg70jylp32gt",

Geolocated footage published on December 10 indicates that Russian forces have advanced in western Novyi Trud and along the E50 highway south of Dachenske, narrowing the small pocket west of the E50 highway and south of the Novyi Trud-Dachenske line.[1] \n\nThis advance places Russian forces about six kilometers south of Pokrovsk. Russian forces will likely continue efforts to close the pocket between Novyi Trud and Dachenske in the coming days, as doing so will provide them a stronger position from which to assault Shevchenko (just northwest of Novyi Trud and southwest of Pokrovsk). Ukrainian Khortytsia Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Nazar Voloshyn noted on December 11 that Russian forces attacked Ukrainian fortifications west of Novyi Trud, south of Novotroitske (southwest of Shevchenko), and on the southwestern outskirts of Shevchenko itself. Voloshyn reported that Ukrainian forces lost two positions during these attacks and are working to restore them.[2] \n\nA Ukrainian battalion commander operating near Pokrovsk characterized the situation in this direction as \"critical,\" largely because each Russian battalion-sized formation receives about 200 fresh personnel per month.[3] The Ukrainian commander also emphasized that Russian forces are attacking Ukrainian positions up to 30 times per day and have an advantage in artillery fires\u2014suggesting that Russian forces are currently relying on a superior number of personnel and artillery ammunition to secure tactical gains in the Pokrovsk direction. ISW recently assessed that the Russian command has resumed offensive operations to seize Pokrovsk via a turning maneuver from the south, but that this maneuver is coming at a massive cost to Russian manpower and equipment.[4] \n\nAnother Ukrainian brigade officer reported that Russian forces lost nearly 3,000 personnel in the Pokrovsk direction in two weeks.[5] Continued Russian losses at this scale will impose a mounting cost on Russia's already-strained force generation apparatus. Russian forces may well continue making gains towards Pokrovsk, but the losses they are taking to do so will temper their ability to translate these gains into more far-reaching offensive operations. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-11-2024",

            "body": "*The Austrian political scientist Gustav Gressel is 45 years old and works as a senior teaching officer at the National Defense Academy in Vienna. From November 2014, he worked for ten years as an expert on Eastern Europe, security policy and military strategies at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.* (Google Translate)\n\nMr. Gressel, the American president wants to meet the Russian president in Riyadh before the end of the month. Will Donald Trump reach a \"deal\" with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine?\n\nBased on what is emerging from the preliminary talks, I wonder whether Ukraine will not become a side note. It seems that the focus is increasingly on deepening American-Russian relations, resuming diplomatic relations, energy cooperation - and Ukraine is being ticked off in passing, so to speak.\n\nWhat might Trump and Putin agree on regarding Ukraine look like?\n\nNow there are reports of a phased plan: first a ceasefire, then elections, then negotiations on a peace agreement. This is very dubious and from the Russian point of view it is the ideal plan: the Russians will get a break at the front to reorganize and possibly an early lifting of the American sanctions. This will make it easier for them to rearm. Then comes the election in Ukraine, where the Russians will try to put forward their own candidate. In my opinion, they are overestimating their abilities here. But if the election does not turn out the way they want, they cannot recognize the election and continue the war.\n\nIf Kyiv does not want to participate, are Trump's means of pressure sufficient to force Ukraine to do so?\n\nTrump will probably stop American arms deliveries to Ukraine anyway. Beyond that, he will have little leverage. If the Ukrainians feel that American support is no longer coming, they will have to negotiate with the Europeans to increase their production capacities. Trump is not as all-powerful as he feels - and it would also be in Europe's interest to show this rather snooty and arrogant administration its limits.\n\nCould a possible ceasefire in Ukraine hold or even lead to peace, as Trump seems to envision?\n\nI think that's about as likely as winning the lottery. Russia has not adhered to any ceasefire negotiated over the past eleven years of this war. Russia's aim of subjugating Ukraine as a whole is still there, as are its maximum demands. They go beyond Ukraine: Moscow wants to establish a European order based on its own wishes. Russia has not yet achieved all of that militarily. But with the USA no longer supporting Ukraine, it is very possible. Putin now has the chance to create a fait accompli with an extremely weak American president. This raises the question for him: should he wait until there is another sane American president? Until the Europeans have success with their rearmament efforts, can defend themselves better and can supply Ukraine with supplies? From the Russian perspective, that makes no sense: the goal would be to strike as quickly and as hard as possible. And I don't think Putin has much reputation to lose here. https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ukraine/russland-experte-gressel-es-droht-ein-grosser-krieg-in-europa-110307271.html",

The naval base at Tartus and the airfield at Latakia are arguably the most important Russian military facilities outside of Russia itself.\n\nThey are key facilities which allow Russia to project power into the Mediterranean and through MENA states (Middle East and North Africa). They are the only reliable warm water ports Russia has in the Mediterranean outside of Turkish dictation, and they have become a support and staging point to supply Russian operations throughout Africa for instance. Without them, Russia strategic possibilities are much more limited. \n\nThis is why Russian control over them, which was gained through its support of the Assad regime, was seen as such an important step by Putin. Indeed, Russian actions in Syria have been key to the overall \"Russia-is-a-great-power\" narrative that has been circulating for almost a decade now. Russia supposedly honed its great military capabilities in Syria and by making the Assad regime dependent on it, extended its global reach in powerful way.\n\nSo this is a major strategic humiliation that could turn into a major strategic problem if Russia loses unfettered access to those bases. It reveals two things.\n\nThe first, is that the impact of the Russo-Ukraine war is to basically denude Russian strength almost everywhere else, as Putin desperately throws all the force he can against Ukraine. The second/third/fourth order effects of the full-scale invasion are not good for Russia (will write a piece on that this week). Basically, the Russians cant even protect a vital ally such as Assad because of their losses in Ukraine.\n\nAnd Putin basically tried to pretend it was no big deal (when he gets really embarrassed, he falls back on the \u201cnothing to see here\u201d defense).",

They should cost Russia billions of dollars per month, if sufficiently enforced, the official said.\nThe sanctions target oil producers, tankers, intermediaries, traders, and ports.\n\n\"There is not a step in the production and distribution chain that's untouched and that gives us greater confidence that evasion is going to be even more costly for Russia,\" the official said. https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-hits-russian-oil-toughest-sanctions-yet-bid-give-ukraine-trump-leverage-2025-01-10/",

The spectacle of today\u2019s meeting risks further unnerving America\u2019s friends and allies around the world, whose major lesson will be that this mercurial president is someone who might pull the rug out from under them at any moment. Some will choose to appease their more powerful neighbors. Others will look closely at their options for self-sufficiency, including developing nuclear weapons. Adversaries will see opportunity to act with greater abandon, i.e., aggression. Any, much less all, of these developments would hurt U.S. interests.\u201d",

Ukraine\u2019s accession to the EU in this state will not do anyone any good. \n\nUkraine\u2019s accession to NATO is unrealistic as long as there are active hostilities. Unless there is some kind of consensus not to go to war (but then why should Ukraine join the alliance at all). Ukraine will be saved by an agreement that guarantees that the state will become part of NATO (in some territories). Russia will not attack NATO territory. \n\nIn general, talk of joining anywhere will lead to nothing. We need to talk about military support for Ukraine. \n\nIf Ukraine wants to join the EU, they must lift sanctions against Poroshenko, build fair courts that will do justice to all, not selectively, build independent institutions, not destroy the State Bureau of Investigation, the National Bank of Ukraine, and so on. \n\nIf Ukraine wants to join NATO, then we need to pray that the world will not turn into fascism and oligarchy, that aid will not stop and that Ukraine will manage to survive, to achieve membership in the military alliance when some kind of agreement is signed to end the war.",

That is not even remotely close to anything prominent European politicians are saying.\n\nYou pretending that an outrageous disgusting lie is just \"aspirational\" is appalling and deranged. \n\nUs being outraged about Trump constantly lying about ending the war doesn't mean that we don't care about the lives of Ukrainians. We are outraged precisely because we care about them, and because Trump lied and claimed with absolutely no basis that he can somehow end the war in 24 hours. \n\nOr indeed that he can end the war at all at a rate that is any faster than what Biden or Harris could have achieved. There is absolutely zero reason to believe that Trump has any real plan for ending the war, beyond maybe doing everything he can to force Ukraine to give massive concessions, handing a massive victory to Russia.\n\nYou know, like he did in Afghanistan in his \"deal\" with the Taliban. A deal which was then somehow Biden's fault afterwards, because Trump and his supporters lie constantly.",

The Ukrainian General Staff reported on September 21 that drone operators of the Ukrainian military, Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), Special Operations Forces (SSO), and Unmanned Systems Forces struck the Tikhoretsk Arsenal just north of Kamenny, Krasnodar Krai and the Russian Main Artillery Directorate of the Ministry of Defense's (MoD) 23rd Arsenal near Oktyabrsky, Tver Oblast (14km south of Toropets).[1] \n\nFootage published on September 20 and 21 shows explosions and secondary detonations at both arsenals, and fires continued at both locations during the day on September 21.[2] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the Tikhoretsk Arsenal contained at least 2,000 tons of munitions, including munitions from North Korea, at the time of the strike.[3] An SBU source told Ukrainian outlet Hromadske that the Russian 23rd Arsenal contained Iskander and Tochka-U ballistic missiles and that Ukrainian forces also struck the Shaykovka Airfield in Kaluga Oblast, and Hromadske included footage of an explosion though it is unclear whether the footage shows the Shaykovka Airfield.[4] \n\nThe Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces intercepted 101 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 drones over Krasnodar Krai and three drones over Tver Oblast.[5] Krasnodar Krai regional authorities blamed the Tikhoretsk Arsenal explosion on falling Ukrainian drone debris, declared a local state of emergency, altered railway schedules and routes, and evacuated about 1,200 civilians from the area.[6] The United Kingdom (UK) MoD reported that the Russian Main Artillery Directorate's 103rd Arsenal near Toropets, which Ukrainian forces struck on September 17 to 18, had recently undergone modernization because Russian forces had been improperly storing munitions at their arsenals, causing explosions at several depots.[7]\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces also struck a Russian Podlet K1 mobile long-range radar system that was protecting the Tikhoretsk Arsenal, and this system is at least the fifth Podlet K1 system that Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged or destroyed since February 2022.[8] The Podlet K1 system can detect up to 200 aerial targets simultaneously at a range of up to 300 kilometers and the Russian military introduced the system into service in 2015.[9] Russian forces use the Podlet K1 system to detect air targets at low and very low altitudes for Russian air defenses, including S-300 and S-400 systems.[10] \n\nUkrainian forces have reportedly damaged or destroyed at least four other Russian Podlet K1 systems since the onset of the full-scale invasion, including in Lazurne, Kherson Oblast as of July 20, 2022; near Zelenotropynske, Kherson Oblast as of July 24, 2022; in Belgorod Oblast as of November 1, 2023; and in an unspecified location as of April 27, 2024.[11] Ukrainian forces also found a destroyed Russian Podlet K1 system in Chornobaivka, Kherson Oblast on November 14, 2022, following Ukraine's liberation of west (right) bank Kherson Oblast as of November 11, 2022, though the cause of this Podlet K1's destruction was unclear. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-21-2024",

They also added to the sanctions list companies and individual vessels associated with the Russian shadow fleet. \n\n\u201cSanctions on tankers have been quite effective but the designation campaign has been too limited to actually rein in Russia\u2019s shadow fleet,\u201d said Benjamin Hilgenstock, one of the authors of the KSE report.\n\nHe added that sanctions should be used \u201csystematically\u201d to enforce a requirement for adequate oil spill insurance and, thereby, \u201caddress the serious and urgent environmental threat stemming from the shadow fleet\u201d.\n\nMany of these vessels regularly navigate busy European waters, including the Baltic Sea, the Danish Straits and the Strait of Gibraltar, increasing the risk of environmental disasters for the EU and neighbouring countries.\n\nKSE proposes the establishment of \u201cshadow-free\u201d zones in European waters to mitigate those risks. Otherwise a disaster is just \u201cwaiting to happen on Europe\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the report argues. \u201cThe weak link in the regulatory framework, together with the dramatically expanded role of shadow tankers in the Russian oil trade, means that a major environmental disaster is only a question of time.\u201d",

Putin added that the West is \u201cbeginning to realistically assess the situation around Ukraine\u201d and \u201cchange its rhetoric\u201d about the need for Russia\u2019s \u201cstrategic defeat,\u201d and that Russia can \u201conly praise\u201d the West for this rhetorical shift away from complete Russian defeat in Ukraine. \n\nPutin later stated in the interview that any outcome of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine must be in Russia\u2019s favor and be based on the \"realities on the battlefield,\" indicating that Russia remains committed to its original goal of forcing the Ukrainian government to capitulate and destroying Ukraine\u2019s statehood and military and that Western hesitance in support for Ukraine only encourages Russia's commitment to this goal. \n\nISW continues to assess that Putin\u2019s theory of victory rests on a critical assumption that the West will abandon Ukraine to Russian victory, either of its own accord or in response to Russian efforts to persuade the West to do so, and that it is far from clear that the West will do so. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-25-2024",

            "body": "The Russian economy looks unable to sustain the war in Ukraine past next year, but an end to the fighting could also pose an existential threat to Putin's regime, according to experts.\n\nIn an analysis in Foreign Policy magazine earlier this month, Marc R. DeVore, a senior lecturer at the University of St. Andrews\u2019s School of International Relations, and Alexander Mertens, a professor of finance at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, explained how Russia can\u2019t produce enough to replace what it\u2019s losing on the battlefield.\n\nFor example, the military is losing about 320 tank and artillery cannon barrels a month, while Russian factories can only produce 20 each month, forcing the Kremlin to dig into aging Soviet stockpiles. But that\u2019s not enough, and Russia will run out of barrels sometime in 2025, DeVore and Mertens estimated.\n\nIn addition, Russia is losing about 155 infantry fighting vehicles a month, but its defense industry can only make 17 a month. The supply-and-demand economics of artillery shells and troops are also unsustainable.\n\n\u201cRussia cannot continue waging the current war beyond late 2025, when it will begin running out of key weapons systems,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBut the Kremlin\u2019s mobilization of the economy to support the war has also left it vulnerable to an eventual end to hostilities.\n\nDeVore and Mertens noted that paring back massive defense spending will trigger an economic downturn and leave many without work.\n\n\u201cThe experience of other societies\u2014in particular, European states after World War I\u2014suggests that hordes of demobilized soldiers and jobless defense workers are a recipe for political instability,\u201d they warned.\n\nThe war has also distorted the composition of Russia\u2019s economy, favoring defense firms at the expense of small- and medium-sized firms that serve the civilian sector, which won\u2019t be able to absorb soldiers and workers displaced by the war\u2019s end.\n\nA peace deal would leave Putin with three unpalatable options, according to DeVore and Mertens. The first would be to shrink the military and defense industry, sparking a recession that threatens the regime. The second is to maintain a massive military that eventually chokes off economic growth.\n\n\u201cHaving experienced the Soviet Union\u2019s decline and fall for similar economic reasons, Russian leaders will probably seek to avoid this fate,\u201d they added.\n\nThe third option is to maintain the military and use it to seize the resources it needs\u2014\u201din other words, using conquest and the threat thereof to pay for the military.\u201d They pointed to offshore gas reserves in the Black Sea, other natural resources in Ukraine, or the withdrawal of Western sanctions as possibilities.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s supersized military sector incentivizes the Kremlin to use its military to extract rents from neighboring states,\u201d DeVore and Mertens said. \u201cThe alternatives\u2014demobilizing and incurring a recession or indefinitely funding a bloated military and defense industry\u2014pose existential threats to Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d https://fortune.com/2024/11/24/russian-war-economy-ukraine-peace-deal-vladimir-putin-donald-trump/",

It is a field with lightly assembled buildings on top, which will cease to function as soon as the enemy gets within artillery or drone flight range,\" he said.\n\n\"The situation with the naval base in Tartous is about the same. Of course, it can be defended and held for quite a long time if there is someone and something to do it, but it will either not be able to function at all, or in a very limited way.\"\nNor, he warned, would a full evacuation of all of Russia's military equipment be possible if it became necessary.\n\"Therefore, the main task of our forces in Syria is to prevent the enemy from entering Latakia, even if we have to temporarily give up the rest of the territory.\"\n\nWith over 600,000 followers, war blogger \"Starshe Eddi\" said Russia had paid a heavy price for a foothold in Syria.\n\"Ten years there, dead Russian soldiers, billions of roubles spent and thousands of tonnes of ammunition expended - they must be compensated somehow and somehow,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The only thing that can...give us a chance to compensate for the current failure and the resources we have used up is our retention of the Latakia and Tartous provinces.\"\n\nIgor Girkin, a prominent Russian ex-militia commander who fought in Ukraine and who is serving a four-year jail term after accusing Putin and the army's top brass of mistakes in the Ukraine war, said Moscow's position in Syria had always been exposed from a reinforcement and supply point of view.\n\n\"Now our enemies have naturally decided to take advantage of our weakness at the moment when we are busy on the Ukrainian front,\" he wrote from prison.\n\"We are overstretched.

London-listed Evraz, in which Ambramovich holds a 28% stake, said it supplied the chemicals for \"civilian use only\". Lukoil, a refiner in which Alekperov retains a shareholding, said it \"does not manufacture explosives or any related components\".\n\nAnna Nagurney, a University of Massachusetts professor who closely studies supply chain networks related to the Ukraine-Russia war and reviewed Reuters' findings, said the five companies were aiding Moscow not only by providing essential chemical ingredients for munitions but also by earning much-needed hard currency from exports of civilian products, including fertilizers.\n\n\"These chemical companies may be operating as civilian ones, but they are sustaining the war effort,\" Nagurney said. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-billionaires-whose-chemical-factories-fuel-russias-war-machine-2024-12-30/",

These miscalculations have backfired, as Ukraine\u2019s determined resistance and commitment to sovereignty, as well as support from Western partners, have thwarted the Kremlin\u2019s original plans.\n* The conflict has evolved into a technological war, where success is determined by equipment quality, situational awareness, and precision strike capabilities rather than sheer numbers. Ukraine is focused on maintaining technological superiority through advanced weapons, drones, and electronic warfare.\n* Any peace negotiations must recognize Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, with continued military and economic support from international partners. These factors are vital for ensuring Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, strengthening its defense capabilities, and maintaining its resistance against Russian aggression. https://jamestown.org/program/settlement-of-the-russian-ukrainian-conflict-ambitions-and-realities/",

The opening encounter on Tuesday saw Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov - two veterans who have spent a combined 34 years in their current roles - negotiate with three Trump administration officials in their first month on the job. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europe-says-it-is-committed-ukraine-ahead-russia-us-talks-2025-02-18/\n\nPersonally, I don't think that peace is possible.

The lack of American materials in this alliance might be compensated for with more manpower, consistent support and two fronts with room for strategic attacks by sea and air. Russia would be stuck fighting on two fronts vs one; as long as control of the Baltic Sea is maintained the fronts would not only be supported by the same navy but united as one via logistics. The Baltic Sea would be relatively easy to retain control over as it would be in the heart of the alliance.\n\nBut I am no general and there is much I do not know.",

But key implication is that if we can keep this war alive for a couple more years Russia is in big trouble:\n\nRussia is about to raise interest rates to 23%. Why? Because (A) tight labour market = 7-8% inflation and (B) they are trying to protect the rouble from further depreciation against the yen, which would make their technology imports from China even more expensive.\n\nThis matters because it makes borrowing extremely expensive. For consumers and businesses, Russia's lending assistance programmes are beginning to end, and mortgage market is slowing and businesses are going bankrupt at an alarming rate.\n\nWay more importantly, running a deficit is harder because government debt repayments surge. For a country looking to spend up to 50% of GDP on military spending, this is a major problem. The article gives Britain and America's '3% war' as an example of the need to keep base rates low when committing to large deficits.  \n  \nYou can't help but read the article and curse Trump. So far, the Russian economy has grown strongly despite the vast sanctions imposed on it. But this article shows that looks set to change. A forced ceasefire stops this.",

Russian sociologist Igor Eidman posted Skobov's \"last word\" for the court. \n\n\"I was brought up in the Soviet Union in the belief that when peaceful people are attacked by an evil and cruel aggressor, one should take up arms and go to fight. And if you cannot hold a weapon, help those who are fighting and encourage others to do so.\n\nAll my publicistic activity is a call to go to fight the aggressor who attacked Ukraine, to help it with weapons and ammunition. I see myself as a participant in the armed confrontation with the aggressor. There's my small part in the missiles and shells that destroy the invaders. And I take responsibility for each destroyed occupier.\n\nNo one attacked Russia, no one threatened it.\n\nPutin's Nazi regime attacked Ukraine. Exclusively because of the megalomania of its leaders, because of the inhuman thirst for power over everything around them.\n\nThey assert themselves by killing hundreds of thousands of people. They are bastards, scumbags, Nazi scum.\n\nThe guilt of Putin's Nazi dictatorship in preparing, unleashing and waging a war of aggression is obvious and needs no proof. Likewise, our right to armed resistance to the aggressor on the battlefield and in the rear of the aggressor does not need proof. Yes, and it would be ridiculous to expect such a confession from a regime that throws people in prison just for words of moral condemnation of aggression. All possibilities of legal protest against Putin's Russian aggression have been destroyed.\n\nMy calls for armed resistance to the aggressor authorities qualify under the article on terrorism. I will not argue with the authorities of the aggressor, even if they will qualify my actions under article about pedophilia. The court in Russia has long ago proved that it is an appendage of Nazi tyranny and it is pointless to seek justice from it. I will never stand before these people \u2013 servants of murderers and scoundrels. I have nothing to argue with them about. Let the guns speak to them for me.\n\nI see no point in arguing with the puppets of a dictatorship about how faithfully they apply their laws. They are in any case the laws of a totalitarian state designed to suppress dissent. I do not recognize these laws and will not obey them.\n\nNor will I appeal against any decisions and actions of the Nazi authorities. I do not need the favor of my armed adversary.\n\nPutin's dictatorship can kill me, but it cannot make me give up fighting it. And wherever I am, I will continue to call on honest Russians to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I will continue to call for strikes on military facilities deep inside Russian territory. I will call on the civilized world to inflict a strategic defeat on Nazi Russia. I will prove the necessity of military defeat of the new Hitler's regime.\n\nPutin is new Hitler, a ghoul mad with impunity, drunk on blood. And I will never tire of repeating, \"Destroy the bastard!\"\n\nDeath to Putin, murderer, tyrant and bastard!\n\nDeath to the Russian fascist invaders!\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\" https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1879826036847755719",

The Russian MoD reported on February 1 that Russia's Black Sea Fleet (BSF) used a drone to destroy a Ukrainian naval drone in the Black Sea.[6] Russian milbloggers claimed that the Russian BSF launched a Kronshtadt Orion missile-capable drone from an unspecified naval asset and that this strike may be the first documented case of Russian forces leveraging a naval asset to deploy drones capable of destroying Ukrainian naval drones.[7] \n\nAnother Russian milblogger called on Russian authorities to increase the production of weapons similar to the drone-launched X-UAV missiles (TKB-1030) to effectively combat Ukrainian forces' naval drone capabilities as it is now too risky for Russia to operate helicopters near the Black Sea.[8] Ukrainian forces have demonstrated their ability to down Russian Mi-8 helicopters operating over the Black Sea using missiles launched from Magura V5 naval strike drones, and the February 1 BSF strike suggests that Russian forces have developed a new method to try to offset this Ukrainian naval drone adaptation. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-1-2025",

He writes on behalf of the foreign ministers of the Nordic and Baltic countries*\n\nGoing forward, three things must be clear.\n\nFirst, before discussing postwar plans, we should do everything we can to help Ukraine achieve peace through a position of strength.\n\nStrength on the battlefield translates to strength at the negotiating table. The sense of urgency must be clear to everyone. We need to provide more military support as quickly as possible to bolster Ukraine and deter Russia from further aggression. We have to move faster and be more resolute. More countries need to do more. Europe must take on a larger responsibility.\n\nSecond, any settlement must be sustainable over time. This requires Ukrainian and European commitment and involvement. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at the Munich Security Conference: \u201cNo decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe.\u201d\n\nThird, If Europe steps up, we will also become a stronger partner for the US. It is only by increasing our own efforts that we will become indispensable in future negotiations.\n\nWe too are focused on ending the war of aggression. But a quick deal risks becoming bad \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 if it does not lead to a lasting and just peace in Ukraine that includes strong security guarantees. A peace that respects Ukraine's borders and right to self-determination and ensures that Russia cannot exploit the situation to rearm and attack again. A deal imposed on Ukraine will not be sustainable.\n\nWe are ready to think creatively to find new financing for Ukraine's military. The time to do so is now. But the European countries must dig deeper into their pockets.\n\nRussia is the most significant direct threat to the security order that we, together with our American allies, have built in Europe since the second world war. This remains true in the long term, regardless of how the war against Ukraine unfolds.\n\n\u201cReset\u201d is a tested path \u2014 it has brought nothing but conflict. Therefore, in addition to doing everything we can to support Ukraine, we must invest much more in our own defence, ensuring that Nato\u2019s defence plans can be implemented in all circumstances.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy is an elected statesman who has heroically led Ukraine through three years of constant attacks on his country and people. We owe it to Ukraine that there is no fourth anniversary of the full-scale war. This requires all of Europe to step up. It is still not too late. Let\u2019s go.",

Russian forces have intensified offensive operations near Kupyansk in Kharkiv Oblast and Selydove, Kurakhove, and Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast over the last two months and have managed to advance at a marginally faster rate than Russian forces have advanced over the last two years.[5] \n\nRussian forces recently seized Vuhledar and Selydove but have yet to make operationally significant advances, and Russian forces have made most of their advances during this time through open fields and small settlements.\n\nRussian forces will eventually make operationally significant gains if Ukrainian forces do not stop ongoing Russian offensive operations, but the Russian military cannot sustain such loss rates indefinitely, especially not for such limited gains. \n\nISW previously observed data indicating that Russian forces have lost at least five divisions' worth of armored vehicles and tanks in Pokrovsk Raion alone since October 2023.[6] Russian forces have likely accumulated a large amount of equipment in priority frontline areas, but dwindling Soviet-era tank and armored vehicle stockpiles and current armored vehicle production rates will likely make such losses prohibitive over the longer term.[7] US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated on October 31 that Russian forces are suffering roughly 1,200 casualties per day, or about 36,000 casualties per month, and ISW has recently observed indications that the Russian military has been struggling to recruit enough soldiers to replace its frontline losses.[8] \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin notably acknowledged Russia's ongoing labor shortages and dependence on migrants to meet these labor shortages during his November 7 Valdai Club address, and ISW noted that Russia also depends on coercing migrants to join the Russian military to meet its manpower requirements.[9] The Russian military almost certainly cannot indefinitely sustain a daily casualty rate of over 1,200 people so long as Putin remains committed to avoiding another involuntary call-up of reservists.[10] Even an involuntary reserve mobilization will not resolve the larger problem Putin apparently faces in finding enough people to work in Russia's industries while also feeding the front.\n\nSelect Russian milbloggers continue to complain about disproportionately high personnel losses, and wider discontent about losses within the Russian ultranationalist milblogger community may also influence Putin's calculus in the future. A former Russian Storm-Z instructor and milblogger complained on November 8 that it takes at least six months to train assault personnel but that the Russian military command is treating assault personnel as \"meat\" who do not require a high level of training and whose primary task is to \"catch drones [and] shrapnel.\"[11] \n\nThe milblogger claimed that Russian infantry losses are high due to the ongoing Russian tactic of sending small assault groups in multiple, successive waves in an attempt to overwhelm Ukrainian forces, which the milblogger labeled as \"stupid\" and \"improperly organized.\" The milblogger concluded that Russian advances \"do not seem proportionate to the irretrievably spent resources \u2013 human and material.\" \n\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-9-2024",

Head of Ukraine's Center for Combatting Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, stated that Russian forces may have also stored ammunition for Grad multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), S-300 and S-400 air defense missiles, and North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles at the facility.[2] \n\nFootage published on September 16 shows large secondary detonations, presumably of missile stockpiles and artillery ammunition, following the initial drone strike.[3] Geolocated footage published on September 18 shows several large smoke plumes over the facility and satellite imagery shows significant damage to the building in the southern part of the facility, although most of the facility is obscured by smoke.[4] Russian authorities claimed that wreckage from a downed Ukrainian drone struck the facility and prompted the secondary detonations, and Russian authorities temporarily evacuated the area near the facility.[5] \n\nRussian milbloggers largely criticized Russian authorities for poorly constructing the facility and accused Russian forces of possibly mishandling missiles and artillery ammunition stockpiles at the facility.[6]  Milbloggers accused the detained former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Army General Dmitri Bulgakov of engaging in corrupt practices leading to poor construction quality at the facility. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-18-2024",

Else, if we don\u2019t send troops, I don\u2019t see how we can deter him from doing so, and if he does now and first, we (and Ukraine) are in a bad position. Let\u2019s imagine: he sends a tactical nuke of 10kT on a small Ukrainian city, tomorrow. The USA doesn\u2019t care and say: \"hey, told you so you should agree to negociate for peace\". What is Europe going to do, then? It will just be effective blackmail from Russia, Ukraine will be forced to surrender, and then other countries will be threatened.\n\nOn the other side, it\u2019s also dangerous to start a war between two nuclear forces. And I don\u2019t have strong arguments other than this scenario to explain why we should enter a hard war and have thousands of French soldiers killed.

Western allies this week revealed that North Korea had sent more than 12,000 troops, disguised as ethnic minorities from Siberia, to fight on Russia\u2019s front lines, a move that analysts say will only heighten Beijing\u2019s concerns over its neighbours\u2019 increasingly cosy military ties.\n\n\u201cThe North Korean troop deployment is a dramatic step, and China will not like it one bit,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul.\n\nFor China, the deployment \u2014 a sharp escalation in a partnership that has deepened since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but was previously largely limited to munitions \u2014 threatens to destabilise the delicate balance of power on the Korean peninsula.\n\nCloser Russian-North Korean ties could also spur the US, Japan and South Korea to strengthen their military alliance in east Asia, which Beijing already views as aimed at containing its growing power.\n\nBeijing wants to avoid at all costs a rerun of the early years of the cold war, when the Soviet Union, North Korea and China formed a \u201cnorthern triangle\u201d that faced off against a \u201csouthern triangle\u201d of South Korea, Japan and the US, Chinese scholars said.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s situation now is really difficult, genuinely a dilemma,\u201d said Zhu Feng, executive dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University. \u201cOn the one hand, we don\u2019t want to see the return of the cold war to east Asia. On the other hand, the US is trying to strengthen solidarity with South Korea and Japan.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi on Friday said that escalating Russian-North Korean co-operation was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and would \u201cworsen the situation in Ukraine and impact the security of the region around Japan\u201d.\n\nSome analysts said Beijing might be tolerating North Korean arms shipments to Russia to alleviate pressure to provide direct military assistance itself.\n\nJaewoo Choo, head of the China centre at the Korea Research Institute for National Security think-tank in Seoul, said \u201cBeijing may actually be secretly pleased that Russia is providing economic aid to North Korea in China\u2019s place\u201d, at a time when China\u2019s own domestic growth was lagging.\n\n\u201cChina remains in the driving seat because ultimately it has control over both countries,\u201d said Lankov, referring to Pyongyang\u2019s reliance on aid from Beijing. \u201cIf China wanted to put a stop to this nonsense as they see it, then they could do so.\u201d",

In response, Russia will dig in, because Ukraine can't immediately go on the offensive even if 3000 tanks are teleported into Ukraine tomorrow.\n\nIt's manpower that is the critical problem and aid won't solve it. Either Ukraine will run out of men willing to fight and die for their country or Russia will run out of men willing to fight and die for 200000 rubles per month. Or out of money required to pay them. Military aid or sanctions relief can affect this equation, of course, but aid alone won't save or condemn Ukraine.",

Zelensky noted that Transnistria's cooperation with Moldova and Ukraine would help reduce electricity prices throughout all of Moldova by 30 percent. \n\nTransnistrian authorities have previously refused Moldovan and Ukrainian offers of help, instead turning to schemes that involve Moscow directly or indirectly providing enough gas to the breakaway republic to cover only its domestic electricity needs.[2]\n\n Ukrainian and Moldovan officials have noted that Russia is trying to leverage its manufactured gas crisis to affect Moldovan public opinion before the Summer 2025 Moldovan parliamentary elections.[3] Transnistria's possible acceptance of Ukrainian and Moldovan offers of aid and Transnistria's subsequent supply of cheaper electricity to the rest of Moldova would disrupt Russian efforts to use the energy crisis to strengthen Transnistria's economic dependence on Moscow, to posture Russia as the breakaway republic's savior and benefactor, and to leverage Chisinau's turn to higher priced European electricity as part of Moscow's anti-EU narratives. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-25-2025",

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported on February 3 that Russian forces suffered 48,240 casualties \u2013 over three Russian motorized rifle divisions worth of personnel \u2013 in January 2025, making January the second-highest month of losses since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[1]\n\nISW has observed geolocated evidence to assess that Russian forces gained roughly 498 square kilometers in January in Ukraine and Kursk Oblast, or roughly 16.1 square kilometers per day. The available figures suggest Russian forces suffered roughly 96 casualties per square kilometer of territory seized. The Ukrainian MoD reported that Russian forces suffered 48,670 casualties in December 2024 \u2013 their highest monthly casualty rate since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion \u2013 and ISW assessed that Russian forces gained a total of 593 square kilometers in December 2024. \n\nThe roughly 100-square-kilometer decrease in seized territory between December 2024 and January 2025, coupled with a similar monthly casualty rate, indicates that Russian forces are taking the same high level of losses despite achieving fewer territorial advances in the near term. ISW previously observed that Russian advances slowed from November 2024 to December 2024.[2] \n\nISW previously assessed that the Russian military command likely tolerated record levels of personnel casualties from September 2024 through November 2024 to facilitate larger territorial gains, but it remains unclear whether the Russian military command will be willing to sustain such casualties if Russian forces' rate of advance continues to decline as Russian forces are advancing on more heavily defended settlements such as Pokrovsk https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-3-2025",

First \u201crout\u201d the enemy and then look at creating a \u201csecurity zone\u201d along the border, he told them. One can safely assume this would be carved from the Ukrainian side and would be as big as Russian forces could make it. Next, Ukrainian forces who had fought inside Russia should be treated not as soldiers, but terrorists. Any foreign mercenaries, he volunteered in a particularly chilling comment, weren\u2019t covered by the 1949 Geneva Convention.\n\nAs Sergey Mironov, head of A Just Russia - For Truth, one of the Russian parliament\u2019s very loyal opposition parties, bluntly put it, the Russian view is that: \u201cIt makes sense to stop a special military operation now only if the Kiev (Kyiv) regime surrenders.\"\n\nIn truth, seeing Western support for Ukraine\u2019s defense begin to crumble three years into his invasion, Putin would be foolish not to squeeze what he can from Washington and Kyiv, even in exchange for a short ceasefire. The more important question is, what does Trump do next? Does he agree to revise the ceasefire terms, and so again give away Ukrainian cards before any true negotiation begins? Or does he refuse to be used in this way and add to sanctions on Russia, as he has threatened? Perhaps, but these are always a slow-burn solution, and this is a president who likes instant results.\n\nThere are several ways this can go. We might discover that Putin really does fear Trump, because he not only agrees to an unconditional ceasefire, but also negotiates a good-faith peace with Ukraine after that. Russia\u2019s position has been so strengthened in recent weeks that the Kremlin would have few reasons other than fear of US retaliation to compromise. But this seems wishful thinking, to put it mildly.\n\nThe second-least probable revelation is that Trump gets as tough on Russia as he has been on Ukraine, as he tries to pressure Putin into an unconditional truce. That would show the US president as the hard-as-nails negotiator he so often says he is.\n\nMore plausible is that Trump enters a negotiation with Putin over his conditions and returns with some or all of them to Kyiv, perhaps once again portraying Zelenskiy as a warmonger and the primary obstacle to peace in the attempt to browbeat him into acceptance of the unacceptable. Putin would have every incentive to drag the talks out and watch the US-Ukraine relationship implode again, all the while expressing his gratitude and ordering his troops to press forward. He is, as Zelenskiy said on Thursday, a master manipulator.\n\nPutin may at a point calculate it is best to give Trump the 30-day ceasefire he needs to prove he still has the \u201cart of the deal,\u201d before finding a pretext to return to Ukraine\u2019s invasion. But what this and the other scenarios have in common is that the big decisions quickly come back to the White House, where patience and strategy are in short supply. Believe me when I say that I want to be proved wrong. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-03-14/the-ukraine-ceasefire-will-test-us-intentions-most-of-all",

            "body": "Some things that I think are worth saying:\n\nNothing is certain. When it comes to anything that primarily involves human behaviour, like politics, a lot of unexpected things can and do happen. Most people are quick to jump to conclusions, yet have no idea what they are talking about. \n\nIt is true that there are some scenarios that are more likely than others, and we should plan accordingly, but those are not guaranteed outcomes. As the saying goes, failing to plan is planning to fail, but also, no plan survives contact with the enemy, or reality.\n\nThere is a strong streak of pessimism and cynicism in this subreddit, but frankly, none of that is helpful to anyone. Cynicism is extremely easy way to make yourself look \"smart\" especially among other cynics, yet it is completely worthless, and in fact often counter-productive, as it will easily devolve into rewarding the worst behaviour. For example, if you believe a statement such as \"all politicians are corrupt\" (or the infamous \"both sides are bad\"), then you will not make a distinction between a politician who may be good but is suspected of corruption, and the worst most corrupt politician ever, thereby massively benefitting the worst politician and giving no benefit to the better politician. \n\nMaintaining a complex worldview is harder, and infinitely more useful. That said, we also shouldn't be na\u00efve, by for example believing that everyone naturally believes in Western concepts like \"human rights\", or that Russia has \"legitimate security concerns\" and can be somehow appeased into not invading other countries.\n\nRegarding the war in Ukraine specifically, I have three things that suggest to me that things aren't necessarily as bad as many people think:\n\nFirst: Based on his previous behaviour and statements, it is the most likely scenario that Trump will cut all Ukraine aid and basically surrender to Russia in all geopolitical matters. But this is not guaranteed unless Trump is seriously holding a personal grudge against Ukraine, or is literally Putin's puppet. Trump doesn't really care about most things, and will believe whoever spoke to him last, or flatters him the most, or promises him the most money. \n\nAmerican generals will universally recognise that it is in USA's interests to help Ukraine, and will devote their efforts towards that goal regardless of who is president. And if there is any force in USA that has near-infinite political power, it is the military-industrial complex, which a massive interest in making sure both that they can keep up manufacturing that exists only because of the need to aid Ukraine, and also keep European countries happy to keep buying American military products. Further, even if USA stops giving Ukraine free aid, they may still be willing to sell weapons to Ukraine, which the EU and others can finance.\n\nFinally, abandoning Ukraine would make Trump look extremely weak, and his ego is his main priority. Biden leaving Afghanistan was one of the worst hits to him politically, even though Americans had been wanting it for ages, and he just followed the (extremely bad) deal that Trump had negotiated for leaving. \n\nSecond: Russia has kept on going and appears relatively stable, despite many experts predicting a collapse in Russia for a long while now. This has raised some mockery and cynicism among many people. But there is a very good reason to keep predicting it: The reality of economics, demographics, and the production of military equipment dictates that Russia\u2019s actions are not sustainable. \n\nRussia is not a magical country. They cannot bullshit their way into having tanks appear out of thin air. Building products that get shipped off to Ukraine to be destroyed is not a basis for an economy. It doesn\u2019t generate any value. You would literally be better off burning the money for warmth, as it is the most expensive useless jobs program in the history of the world. And while it has proven very hard to predict when exactly a tipping point is reached, you don't run a 21% interest rate unless something is seriously messed up under the hood.\n\nThird: During the past 3 years, despite the constant criticism, unless European countries are literally ruled by cognitively challenged people, we have not been asleep regarding our military production. Losing American aid would be bad for Ukraine, but it is not the end. Remember, the EU has been Ukraine's main aid provider since the beginning, and the EU will keep growing when it comes to military production, while Russia has had to resort to going all the way to North Korea for shells and now for basic cannon fodder. Ukraine has been building more of its own military production as well.\n\nThere are 2 more months left to prepare for a post-USA world, and that time ought to be used well.",

            "body": "Russia's economy and war effort is coming under increasing strain, which will pose increasingly acute challenges to Putin's ability to sustain the war over the long term. The Washington Post reported on October 27 that the Russian economy is \"in danger of overheating,\" noting that Russia's excessively high military spending has fueled economic growth in a way that has forced Russian companies to artificially raise their salaries in order to fulfill labor demands by remaining competitive with Russia\u2019s high military salaries.[1] The Washington Post quoted Russian Central Bank Head Elvira Nabiullina, who warned in July 2024 that Russia's labor force and production capacity are \"almost exhausted.\" \n\nThe Washington Post noted that private Russian companies are struggling to keep up with Russian military salaries and are increasingly having to offer wages several times higher than the typical industry averages. ISW has recently reported that Russian regional authorities are significantly increasing the one-time signing bonuses for Russian contract servicemembers in order to sustain Russia\u2019s rate of force generation (roughly 30,000 troops per month), which underscores the fact that Russia does not have an indefinite pool of manpower and must financially and socially reckon with the ever-growing costs of replenishing its frontline losses via various force-generation avenues.[2] \n\nThe Washington Post also noted that Russia's stringent migration policies, particularly after the March 2024 Crocus City Hall attack, have further depleted Russia's labor pool and amplified economic frictions. This has particularly become the case as migrant workers are increasingly identifying Russia as a hostile and unattractive place to relocate for work.[3] ISW has reported at length on the balance that Putin is trying to strike between catering to his pro-war ultranationalist constituency, which espouses extreme anti-migrant sentiments, and his practical need to leverage migrant labor both economically and militarily.[4]\n\nPutin very likely assesses that calling another partial mobilization wave, or introducing general mobilization, will be too costly to his regime, and has therefore resorted to crypto-mobilization efforts that appear to be placing greater and greater strains on the Russian wartime economy. The recent appearance of North Korean troops in Russia, and their reported deployment to the combat zone in Kursk Oblast, further suggests that Putin's entire force-generation system is very tenuous.[5] \n\nThe costs of fueling the war will increase as Russia continues to burn through manpower and materiel on the frontline. Russian resources are finite, and Putin cannot reckon with these costs indefinitely. Russia's economy will reach a burnout point. That burnout point will inflict great costs on Russian society, which may force Putin to make major decisions about how to resource Russia\u2019s war or change Russia\u2019s mode of warfighting to preserve his regime\u2019s stability. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-27-2024",

They have also been complaning, very vocally, about being starved of artillery munition just as the Russians were advancing. So no, not a wild guess.

He also believes that the US should not get involved in foreign wars unless it's absolutely vital to US interests. He's being pretty consistent.",

A Russian Telegram user, who claims to be an employee of an unspecified branch of the Russian special services, claimed on November 2 that Ukrainian forces conducted an ATACMS strike against a Russian S-300/400 air defense system near occupied Mospyne (just southeast of Donetsk City) and that their sources are still clarifying the damage to the system.[1] The Telegram user claimed that Ukrainian forces targeted the air defense systems with six ATACMS missiles and that Russian forces downed three of the missiles. The Telegram user claimed on October 31 that Ukrainian forces struck a Russian \"Podlet\" radar station near occupied Cape Tarkhankut, Crimea with a drone on October 23 and that Russian forces have not evacuated the damaged station for repairs yet.[2] \n\nA Ukrainian division posted footage on October 31 purportedly showing a successful Ukrainian strike against a Russian Buk air defense system in an unspecified frontline area, and the footage showed secondary detonations consistent with a successful strike against such a system.[3] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on October 25 that Ukrainian forces struck a Russian Buk-M3 air defense system and destroyed the radar system of another Buk-M2 air defense system in occupied Luhansk Oblast on the night of October 24 to 25.[4] Official Ukrainian sources reported that Ukrainian forces also struck a Buk-M2 system in southern Ukraine on October 23 and a Buk-M3 air defense system on the night of October 20 to 21 in an unspecified frontline area.[5] \n\nISW has previously observed indications that Russia has struggled to source the microelectronic components necessary to produce complex weapons and air defense systems due to Western sanctions, and Russia may not be able to produce or repair a sufficient number of air defense systems to maintain the current density of Russia's air defense coverage over occupied Ukraine if Ukraine destroys a significant number of Russian systems.[6] Further degradation of Russia's air defense umbrella, particularly over occupied Ukraine, may impact how close to the frontline Russian pilots are willing to operate and could limit Russia's ability to effectively use glide bombs against both frontline areas and rear Ukrainian cities. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-2-2024",

Using Ukrainian estimates of Russian casualties that could not be independently verified \u2014 372,340 dead, wounded, missing and taken prisoner \u2014 that means 169 soldiers were lost to the fighting per square km of territory gained.\n\nAs the conflict drags on, Russia is poised to spend a record of around 40% of its 2025 budget on defense and security, putting the country\u2019s economy even more on a war footing. That equates to some 6.2% of gross domestic product. Germany, as NATO\u2019s second-biggest spender in dollar terms after the US, will lay out about 2.1% of GDP on defense this year. Even given the relative size of their economies, that still means total Russian defense spending is 50% as big again as that of Germany.\n\nDespite spiraling inflation and the impact of unprecedented sanctions, Russia can weather the economic pressures of such expenditure for at least three to five years, a recent report by prominent dissident Russian economists concluded. According to some western estimates, Russia\u2019s economy will start struggling toward the end of 2025.\n\nRussia may face equipment shortages sooner, though. It\u2019s having to cover some of its weapons requirements, including for armored vehicles, by retooling reserve Soviet-era stocks, and may burn through this source of armaments in 2026, according to Dara Massicot, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nIn recent months, Zelenskiy has flagged that he is not opposed to negotiations but wishes to hold them from a position of strength. The question now is how long he can hold out, and whether Trump could make good on his promises not only to reach a deal over Ukraine\u2019s head but those of his European allies. While the mood in Kyiv was somber following Trump\u2019s re-election, some in the Ukrainian capital say that Trump\u2019s erratic record means there\u2019s room for positive surprises and that they hope he can be convinced the country\u2019s defense is a cause worth supporting.\n\nThe flow of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine will still be key.\n\nIt may take time for Europe to increase production, but it already makes its own weapons with advanced capabilities, such as the German Taurus cruise missile or Anglo-French Storm Shadow. The question is whether they can unite their defense capabilities and produce at scale, said Ben Hodges, a retired US army general and former commander of American forces in Europe.\n\nEven without the US, \u201cthe combined economies of the west dwarf Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about political will.\u201d https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-11-27/russia-ukraine-war-can-europe-fill-defense-gap-if-trump-withdraws-support",

Suspilne's sources noted that Ukrainian strikes are undermining Russia's ability to conduct long-range missile strikes against Ukraine.[8] Ukrainian forces conducted a series of HIMARS strikes against Russian ammunition depots throughout occupied Ukraine in Summer 2022, prompting Russian forces to disperse ammunition storage facilities and degrading the efficiency of Russian logistics at the time.[9] \n\nRepeated strikes against ammunition depots within Russia that cause similar levels of damage to the strike in Toropets may force a similar decision point on the Russian military command to reorganize and disperse support and logistics systems within Russia to mitigate the impact of such strikes.  Russian forces may not have addressed vulnerabilities at many logistics facilities within Russia due to the sanctuary space that restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western-provided weapons have generated, although the Toropets facility is not within range of Western systems fired from Ukraine. \n\nThe lifting of restrictions on the use of Western systems and the continued development of Ukraine's own long-range strike capabilities may allow Ukrainian forces to more effectively exploit such Russian vulnerabilities. Ukrainian forces struck another Russian ammunition depot near Sergeevka, Voronezh Oblast in July 2024 and continued Ukrainian strikes against Russian ammunition and missile storage facilities could also destroy an important portion of Russia's materiel reserves.[10] \n\nUkrainian strikes against facilities within Russia could impact offensive operations throughout the theater in Ukraine if Ukrainian forces have the materiel, capabilities, and permission to conduct such a strike campaign against logistics and support facilities within Russia at scale. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-18-2024",

For the first time, the share of spending on defence will be double that of social spending.\n\nThe huge increase in military spending is generating inflationary heat in Russia's economy. Interest rates have risen to their highest since 2003 and the rouble has slid to a one-year low against the dollar. With Western sanctions effectively barring Moscow from the international bond markets its fundraising options are limited.\n\nThe government has already started raising taxes to fund its war in Ukraine, now in its third year. A major tax reform is expected to generate additional revenues worth 1.7% of GDP in 2025. Economists argue this will not be enough. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-braces-more-tax-rises-fund-ukraine-war-2024-10-31/",

The defence of those three cities would be Stalingrad-esque and dwarf Mariupol in scale, after Russia would had already spent its Cold War ammunition reserves, national reserves (financially), and bled significantly in human cost.\n\nUkraine would draft its people if it comes to it as the threat would be existential.

What level of support?\n\nI agree that $160 billion in appropriations in two years is in the  interests of Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, etc, and their shareholders and other stakeholders, but I don't think is in the interest of the majority of Americans. \n\n2 - Then he parrots the usual dangerous nonsense about strikes in Russia and the possibility of a nuclear war and obviously I disagree. These people seem to believe the possibility of a nuclear war is a controlled decision, an act of rational will, and that's frankly scary. This is what you get when you star electing leaders with the intellectual curiosity of a herring. \n\nHe flat out doesn't understand how escalation actually works and how nuclear holocaust scenarios actually play out. He's another person living in a world of abstractions and computer games, not the real one. \n\nThis is a consequence of the Great Forgetting - people like him would be considered absolute lunatics during the Cold War. I mean Reagan was considered (pretty unfairly) a dangerous cowboy. And this guy is multiple orders of magnitude more extreme than Reagan - who actually quickly became less belicous and toned down after being elected president - to the point that by 1982 he was being called an appeaser. \n\nIt's pure insanity based on flat out ignorance. I mean, saying \"the more you talk about nuclear weapons the less you use it\" is an absolutely insane thing to say. Not because it's true or false, it's because it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the topic - again, the belief that a nuclear war will be triggered by a well ordered rational deliberate intention making process is flat out insane. \n\n3 - As for the 4 conditions, the 2nd one was, and I quote \"we need to make sure Russia will NEVER do this AGAIN, to Ukraine or ANYONE ELSE\". \n\nI basically stopped listening here because this is **flat out insanity**. \n\nWhat the hell does this even mean? In concrete, in reality? Like, how do you \"make sure\" of such a thing in the real world? \n\nAssuming it's something to take seriously, and not merely adolescent squealing - in which case there's no reason to listen to a single world of what he has to say and he's just a crazy man -, how on earth do you make sure that \"Russia never does this ever again\"?\n\nTreaties can be reneged on - I mean, people like him and you often argue \"you can't trust Russia\", \"a peace deal would only allow Russia to rearm, etc\".\n\nThe only way of doing such a thing - again, assuming he meant it and isn't just an irresponsible adolescent - is to permanently disarm Russia - that would imply pretty much destroying Russia as a country, even as a nation; and, at the very least, abolish the Russian military. \n\nThis is patently absurd. ANd yet it's the only concrete thing that \"make sure Russia never does this again to any other country\" can possibly mean. Because as long as Russia exists as such and has enough people and tech to build up an army, you simply can't make sure they won't do it again.\n\nSo one of the conditions to end the war is actually running over Russia, destroy its military, take hold of their nuclear arsenal, deindustrialize Russia, etc?\n\nI mean, what's even the point of saying such a thing - he's literally confirming Putin talking points? If we're supposed to take this dude seriously, why on earth wouldn't a Russian conclude \"Holy fuck, these guys want to razor us to the ground, he just said there will be war until we lose offensive military capacity FOREVER. We're in an existential war against the West, and we should use nuclear weapons to avoid defeat\". \n\n\nHere's what the actual problem is:\n\nPeople like you will listen to something like \"we need to make sure Russia never attacks another country\" and you go like \"oh yeah, I agree, that's good!\" (same if it's for CHina or any other country). I mean, it's good, definitely - we don't want offensive wars, or military aggression, from Russia or anyone else.\n\nPeople like me listen to it and think \"well, this is obviously insane, it'll never happen without a global war with the strong possibility of ending civilization; this is either an empty platitude and this guy is an idiot for this insane sabre-rattling or he means it and he's an absolute deranged lunatic that should be institutionalized\". \n\nBecause you don't really think - you \"think\" through feelings. Does it sound good? Would it \"make the world a better place\"? Then you agree.\n\nAnd that how we end up guys in suit saying in a very serious tone a condition to end the war is disarming Russia forever and people like you nodding. \n\nAgain, it's just LARPing, overemotional nonsense. \n\nI think that's actually a big reason why you people hate Trump - because he gets in the way of that silly LARPing. He brings reality into that feely feely nonsense. Suddenly you can't just carry on parroting empty platitudes and talking points about how \"Ukraine must win\". And that just hurts and makes you angry and lash out.\n\nAnyway I couldn't listen to the rest - that guy is just talking to people like you. He's not really talking about reality, he's a politician saying vacuities. If there's a specific point you want to me address, let me know what is it and provide a timestamp.",

Prominent Kremlin-affiliated milblogger Mikhail Zvinchuk gave an interview to Belarusian state newswire Belta on September 20 describing the war in Ukraine as a \u201cstrange under-war\" that predominantly operates on a political plane.[41] \n\nZvinchuk claimed that the West\u2019s primary objective of the war in Ukraine is not to achieve a strategic military defeat of Russia, but rather to secure profits and political advantages domestically. He noted that if the West genuinely aimed to defeat Russia, it would have provided Ukraine with more weapons and means of combat along with greater NATO involvement. \n\nZvinchuk argued that the West\u2019s actions have not significantly challenged Russia and suggested that the West\u2019s slow and limited support has given Russia enough time to strengthen its defenses and build up its forces. Zvinchuk also falsely claimed that Ukraine is simply a testing ground for Western artificial intelligence (AI) and command and control (C2) systems, echoing previous Russian statements suggesting that Ukraine is simply a military testing site for the West.[42] \n\nWestern hesitation in approving Ukraine's ability to use long-range Western-provided weapons to strike military objects in Russia and previous delays in Western aid provision to Ukraine may have further confirmed the Kremlin's assessment that Russia can outlast Western support for Ukraine.[43] Western policymakers maintain the power to properly equip Ukraine and challenge the Kremlin's assessment of Western commitment to Ukraine. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-21-2024",

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that outcome will largely be a consequence of decisions that Biden took, or failed to take, over the past two years.\n\nDespite the US sending more than $90 billion in aid and arms, some allies are frustrated with Biden for stalling on key decisions to deliver more advanced weapons at crucial points in the conflict.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Ukrainian forces had Putin on the back foot and Zelenskiy was appealing to Biden for more weapons to press home his advantage. But Biden hesitated. His thinking was shaped by the possibility that an escalation might bring Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal into play, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has suggested.\n\n\u201cHis heart was undoubtedly in the right place \u2014 he understood the importance of standing with Ukraine against Russian aggression,\u201d former UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in an interview. \u201cHowever, his approach was often too cautious and too hesitant, holding back on delivering the decisive support needed to tip the balance.\u201d\n\nSullivan has refuted that view, saying on Dec. 7 that the US operation to arm Ukraine both before and during the war had been an \u201cextraordinary feat.\u201d Indeed, US support was critical for ensuring that Ukraine wasn\u2019t overrun, especially at the start of the war, and rallying allies after the invasion.\n\nOther US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, voiced their frustration with some European governments who they said were slow to accept that Putin would invade and then reluctant to ship weapons at all, at least until they learned of the abuses the Russians had perpetrated. Europe has often bristled at tougher sanctions and even as the US position on inviting Ukraine to join NATO appeared to soften, opposition in Berlin and elsewhere remained firm, the officials noted.\n\nThe paradox, other officials said, is that the outcome for Ukraine is now similar regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump are in charge. Trump has called for an immediate ceasefire and his national security nominees have indicated that any deal would likely see Ukraine having to accept freezing its territory along current battle lines and give up its aspiration of joining NATO any time soon.\n\nBehind the incipient blame game lies a deeper truth that frustrates officials on both sides of the Atlantic: for all the talk of European capitals reviving their hard power, the US is still the only NATO country that can tip the balance in a major conflict involving Russia. So the outcome of the war in Ukraine will inevitably be shaped by decisions taken in the White House.\n\nAs a Cold War veteran who joined arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union, Biden was obsessed with the danger of nuclear escalation, one of the officials said. When urged to do more US officials repeatedly said that the risks were just too great. Other allies, like Germany, had similar worries.\n\nThe fundamental problem, according to two senior European officials, was that Biden\u2019s strategy seemed geared to preventing Ukraine from losing, without setting out a path to victory. That, the officials said, left Ukraine locked into a drawn-out conflict costing tens of thousands of lives.\n\nBut going all-in wasn\u2019t the only option open to Biden.\n\nLess than a year into the war, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley offered an alternative approach which wouldn\u2019t have incurred the same risk of Russian escalation: push Zelenskiy into talks with Putin.\n\n\u201cThe Russian military is really hurting bad,\u201d Milley said in November 2022. \u201cYou want to negotiate at a time when you\u2019re at your strength, and your opponent is at weakness.\u201d\n\nAt that point in the conflict, though, such suggestions were considered beyond the pale. The mantra from western officials, in public and private, was that only Zelenskiy and the Ukrainians would decide when to negotiate.\n\nAccording to a senior European official, Biden had two strategic options: ramp up support to let Kyiv finish the job or push for peace negotiations. He chose neither.\n\nWhile the US did increase weapons supplies ahead of the failed counteroffensive of 2023, two former UK officials said they had tried to convince Biden that much more was needed much more quickly, but they ran into his concerns of nuclear escalation. Those concerns were overstated, one UK official said, because at every stage the Russian threats proved illusory.\n\nUS officials argue that, on the contrary, sabotage attacks in Europe and Moscow\u2019s increasingly intensive targeting of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure show that Putin was prepared to escalate so they had to take his nuclear threats seriously.\n\n\u201cThe president has another responsibility that\u2019s unique,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at an event in Washington this week. \u201cWhere the buck stops is at that desk, and it has been his responsibility to make sure that Ukraine has everything we can possibly provide to deal with the aggression \u2014 but also to avoid a direct conflict with with Russia. We don\u2019t need a direct conflict between nuclear-armed powers.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Washington said that the US ultimately sent everything it could, when stocks allowed and when in their assessment capabilities made sense on the battlefield. To that effect, the ramp-up in ammunition supplies has helped to narrow a Russian advantage which had seen them firing several times more shells than the Ukrainians earlier in the conflict.\n\nUS officials also argue that no single capability is a silver bullet and that Ukraine is now impeded more by a shortage of manpower than weapons.\n\nCIA chief William Burns said earlier this year that there was \u201ca genuine risk of a potential use of tactical nuclear weapons\u201d in the fall of 2022, but that the US and its allies shouldn\u2019t be intimidated by what he called Moscow\u2019s saber-rattling. Burns met his Russian counterpart in Turkey that November to warn him against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nNevertheless, as Biden agonized over whether to send more air defenses, longer range missiles, or fighter jets to Kyiv, Putin trained his missiles on Ukraine\u2019s cities. That weakened Kyiv\u2019s economy and the resolve of its people, degrading the war-torn country\u2019s ability to fight back, while Moscow was granted crucial time to prepare and adapt its defenses.\n\n\u201cWe do believe that earlier and more would have been quite decisive,\u201d Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze said in an interview. \u201cBut it is what it is.\u201d",

This, and the United States' disproportionate role in European defence in general, is increasingly anachronistic and unacceptable. This security framework has notably failed to deter Russia from invading Ukraine, resulting in a full-scale war so close to some of our borders that it has crossed them multiple times.\n>\n> We're grateful for the support of our American allies, Canada and the United States, but we think Europe should become more independent of it. To that end, we propose transferring some of the responsibilities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Military Staff of the European Union, because we think this organizational change is needed to make progress. We call on the European Commission to support this, or explain why it doesn't and how a common European defence could be realized.\n\nThis angle, focusing on the [Supreme Allied Commander Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander_Europe), is the best I've come up with so far. Its weakness is that theoretically the nonsense of having an American in command of European forces on European territory could be solved without transferring any responsibility from NATO to the EU.",

When they arrived with the help of a Houthi-linked company, they were then forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to the front lines in Ukraine.\n\nThe appearance of the ragtag group of \u2014 mainly involuntary \u2014 Yemeni mercenaries in Ukraine shows how the conflict is increasingly sucking in soldiers from abroad as casualties rise and the Kremlin tries to avoid a full mobilisation. They include mercenaries from Nepal and India and some 12,000 North Korean regular army troops who arrived to take part in combat against Ukrainian forces in the Russian province of Kursk.\n\nThe Yemeni recruitment effort also underscores how Russia, driven by its confrontation with the west, is growing closer to Iran and allied militant groups in the Middle East. The Houthis, a militant group backed by Tehran, disrupted global supply chains with a missile campaign targeting shipping in the Red Sea after the start of the war in Gaza last year.\n\nUS diplomats say the entente between the Kremlin and the Houthis, unimaginable before the war in Ukraine, is a sign of how far Russia is willing to go to extend that conflict into new theatres including the Middle East.\n\nUS special envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking confirmed Russia is actively pursuing contacts with the Houthis and discussing weapons transfers, though he declined to be more specific.\n\n\u201cWe know that there are Russian personnel in Sana\u2019a helping to deepen this dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kinds of weapons that are being discussed are very alarming, and would enable the Houthis to better target ships in the Red Sea and possibly beyond.\u201d\n\nMaged Almadhaji, the head of the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies, a Yemen-focused think-tank, said Russia too is taking an interest \u201cin any group in the Red Sea, or in the Middle East, that is hostile to the US\u201d.

Belousov claimed that the Russian military has recruited over 427,000 volunteer servicemembers so far in 2024, a daily average of more than 1,200 people.[23] \n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated on October 31 that Russian forces are suffering roughly 1,200 casualties per day, and the UK Ministry of Defense (MoD) recently observed that Russian forces suffered record-high casualty rates in November 2024 with an average 1,523 casualties per day \u2013 notably higher than Belousov's claimed 1,200 recruits per day.[24] Russian opposition outlet Vazhnye Istorii reported on December 16 that data from federal budget expenditures on one-time payments to those who sign military service contracts with the Russian MoD indicate that between 215,700 and 249,000 people signed contracts in the first three quarters of 2024.[25]\n\nVazhnye Istorii noted that the Russian government has not published data from the fourth quarter of 2024 yet but that at least 178,000 people would have had to have signed contracts between October 2024 and mid-December 2024 in order to reach Belousov's 427,000 figure. ISW cannot independently verify Russia's recruitment rates, and the Russian government may be delaying or even refusing to pay one-time payments to recruits such that the expenditure data does not reflect actual recruitment rates. ISW has recently observed indications that the Russian military has been struggling to recruit enough soldiers to replace its frontline losses.[26] \n\nContinued intensified offensive operations in Ukraine, particularly in western Donetsk Oblast, have put an unsustainable strain on Russia's force generation apparatus and economy. Russian authorities will likely have to balance mounting personnel losses and the growing pressure to enact a deeply unpopular partial involuntary reserve callup. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-16-2024",

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed during a meeting on economic issues on January 22 that 2024 was a \"strong year\" for the Russian economy.[1] Putin claimed that Russia has a manageable budget deficit of 1.7 percent and achieved a 26 percent increase in non-oil-and-gas revenue to 25.6 trillion rubles (approximately $257.9 billion) in 2024 and announced a retroactive 9.5 percent increase in insurance and military pensions to address rising Russian inflation.\n\nBloomberg reported on January 21 that the Russian Finance Ministry released a report projecting economic strength and suggesting that Russian budget revenue in December 2024 reached a record high of over 4 trillion rubles (about $40 billion) \u2014 a 28 percent increase compared to December 2023 and the highest level recorded since 2011.[2] The data fails to account for Russia's unsustainable levels of defense spending, rampant inflation, a growing deficit and the erosion of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, however.[3] \n\nISW continues to observe macroeconomic data that directly contradict the Kremlin's claims that the Russian economy is performing well. The Kremlin has recently adopted policies aimed at increasing defense spending all while Russian society faces labor shortages, broader demographic issues, declining savings, and increasing reliance on bailouts as the Russian economy faces rising interest rates, inflated salaries, and deteriorating production capacity.[4] \n\nThese economic realities suggest that the Kremlin's efforts to posture economic strength are largely an information operation aimed at reassuring domestic audiences and posturing Russian strength abroad while masking the true challenges Russia's economy is facing, particularly heightened due to its war against Ukraine. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-22-2025",

Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev stated on March 5 that US weapons supplies to Ukraine will \"most likely resume\" but that Russia's \"main task\" remains \"inflicting maximum damage\" on Ukraine \"on the ground.\"[21] \n\nMedvedev's statement is consistent with ISW assessment that Russian forces will likely attempt to take advantage of the pause in US aid in order to make further gains in eastern and southern Ukraine to justify Russia's territorial claims to the entirety of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts.[22] \n\nMedvedev also indicated that Russia is aware that it may have a limited time frame in which to leverage the US suspension of aid to \"inflict maximum damage\" on Ukrainian forces.

They are likely to be a logistical burden for the Russians and there will be cultural, doctrinal and tactical tensions with the integration of the North Koreans into Russian forces. Given the size of the North Korean contingent, they are unlikely to have a decisive impact on the war in Ukraine. Russia is currently suffering around 1200 casualties a day in Ukraine. The North Koreans represent about a week\u2019s human expenditure by Russia.\n\nHowever, if these deployments are conducted more regularly, they could be a way for Russia to sustain the current offensive in the east of Ukraine AND sustain high numbers of casualties without having to undertake another mobilisation in 2025.\n\nNorth Korea, which already supplies rockets and artillery munitions to the Russian war effort, has much to gain from becoming a co-belligerent in the war against Ukraine. Politically, it ensures it has a grateful \u201cfellow traveller\u201d in Russia. Additionally, Russia may provide an array of financial incentives for North Korea\u2019s troop deployment. It is likely to share with North Korea many of the new tactics and technologies developed for the war, as well as intelligence on captured Western equipment. Less likely, but still possible, the Russians could share technology to enhance the capacity of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon delivery systems. \n\nMuch more: https://mickryan.substack.com/p/the-big-five-27-october-edition",

She pushed interest rates to 21%, but inflation, now running at about 9% a year, is showing no signs of abating. It is fuelled by the massive spending on the war in Ukraine, now at about 8% of GDP, and the government\u2019s associated budget deficits of about 2% of GDP. \n\nThe rouble\u2019s weakness makes things worse by increasing the prices of imported goods.\nInflation is also propelled by the economy\u2019s overheating. The militarisation of Russia has diverted resources to the defence sector, creating labour shortages in the rest of the economy. \n\nIn this tight labour market, only 2% of the working age population is unemployed. The flight of talent after the Ukraine invasion, and a plan to mobilise up to 1.5 million men, have shrunk the available workforce. In these conditions, the civilian economy has no capacity for further growth, while inflation on daily products has reached new highs \u2013 butter thefts are on the rise because it has become so expensive.\n\nDespite the punishing level of real interest rates, Russian corporates keep asking for more loans, albeit at variable rates, in the hope that they will be lowered soon, as in previous episodes of currency tensions. \n\nCorporate borrowing grew at the same hefty pace this year \u2013 by 15% year-on-year \u2013 as it did in 2023, when interest rates were much lower.\nNabiullina has warned that this time is different, and has pledged to keep rates high until she tames inflation. But whether or not she is free to do what she thinks is right depends on Putin alone. https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/currency-drop-worsens-moscows-stagflation-fears-2024-11-29/",

Reuters, citing five sources with knowledge of the situation, reported on January 23 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is growing increasingly concerned about \"distortions\" in the Russian economy due to the war in Ukraine.[4] \n\nTwo sources familiar with \"thinking in the Kremlin\" told Reuters that there is a camp within the Russian elite that views a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine as desirable and key to addressing Russia's economic issues. One source claimed that Putin recognizes the strain that the war is placing on the Russian economy and assesses that he has achieved his \"key war goals\" in Ukraine, including seizing land in southern Ukraine to connect Russia within occupied Crimea and weakening the Ukrainian military. \n\nThe source did not speculate on Putin's willingness to end the war, however. Russian opposition outlet Meduza reported on January 9 \u2014 citing sources in the Russian presidential administration, State Duma, and wider Russian federal government and regional governments \u2014 that Russian elites are growing increasingly dissatisfied with the impact of the war on the Russian economy. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-23-2025",

The Kremlin is investing significant time and effort into undermining and misrepresenting the US-Ukrainian mineral deal, indicating that the Kremlin views the deal as an impediment to accomplishing Russian President Vladimir Putin's objectives in Ukraine.[9] \n\nThe mineral deal, even one that does not include text about an American security guarantees for Ukraine, will represent a long-term US economic investment in Ukraine and could be a building block towards additional US assistance or military sales to Ukraine in the future, as US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent observed in an interview to CBS on March 2.[10] Any agreement that ties the United States to an independent and sovereign Ukraine is contrary to Russia's long-term goals of isolating and conquering Ukraine. \n\nPutin likely assesses that preventing the US-Ukrainian mineral deal is a necessary step towards pushing the United States into stopping military assistance to Ukraine and abandoning Ukraine altogether. Putin's articulated theory of victory in Ukraine \u2014 which assumes that Russia can continue slow, gradual advances in exchange for significant personnel and materiel losses \u2014 rests on the assumption that Russia can outlast and overcome US and European security assistance to Ukraine and Ukrainian efforts to mobilize its economy and population to support its defense.[11] \n\nPutin is likely attempting to undermine the US-Ukrainian mineral deal in order to prevent deepening US-Ukraine ties in the hope that Russia will be able to destroy or extract significant territorial concessions from Ukraine during future negotiations before Russia's own wartime economic and force generation issues begin to significantly impede Russia ability to advance on the battlefield in 2025 and beyond https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-2-2025",

            "body": "https://www.ft.com/content/2e908d56-603b-4e60-b70c-7d2d5bda8ec5\n\nAfter the verbal assault on Volodymyr Zelenskyy by Donald Trump and his vice-president JD Vance, Ukraine was facing catastrophe. The obvious risk was that Trump would work with Vladimir Putin to force an isolated Ukraine to accept a de facto Russian victory.\n\nThat risk still remains. But some highly adept diplomacy by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, working closely with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, has staved off the worst for now. At a meeting in London, Zelenskyy was warmly embraced by European political leaders and later met King Charles \u2014 who seemed unconcerned that the Ukrainian leader was not wearing a suit. The message was clear. Zelenskyy and Ukraine are not alone.\n\nEven more important, Starmer and Macron may have temporarily wrested the diplomatic initiative from Trump and Putin. By announcing that European nations will work with Ukraine on a peace proposal \u2014 which will then be presented to the US \u2014 they have made it harder for Trump to treat peace in Ukraine as something to be negotiated between America and Russia alone.\n\nRather than simply bleating that Europe and Ukraine must be at the table, Starmer and Macron have taken important steps to make sure that happens. The French are also pushing for a temporary ceasefire, which underlines that they are working for peace.\n\nBut any excitement about these developments needs to be heavily qualified. It is still likely that the peace initiatives will founder. There is no real sign that Russia is prepared to stop fighting. In fact, Putin\u2019s incentives to cut a deal are diminishing fast, since he now has a realistic hope that the US may soon end military aid for Ukraine.\n\nIt also seems very unlikely that the US will agree to provide a military backstop to an Anglo-French \u201creassurance force\u201d in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s obsessive fear of a third world war will make him extremely reluctant to take that risk. And yet Starmer is insistent that no deal can work without an American backstop.\n\nEven if a peace deal is achieved, it will take many months to negotiate. In the meantime, Ukraine is likely to have to fight on against an emboldened Russia. Even before last week\u2019s showdown between Trump and Zelenskyy, it was already evident that Trump will not agree to another package of US aid for Ukraine. In the row\u2019s immediate aftermath, there was even talk that America would immediately cut off all shipments of military aid to Ukraine\n\nKelly Magsamen, who was chief of staff to Lloyd Austin when he was US defence secretary, responded to those reports by commenting: \u201cThis could cripple Ukraine within weeks . . . We would basically be handing Ukraine to Putin.\u201d Another former Biden official reckons Ukraine could fight on without American support for months \u2014 but probably not years.\n\nHowever, the mood among many Ukrainians involved in the war effort is more positive \u2014 as I discovered in Kyiv last week. This is not mere bravado. It is based on a reasoned assessment of how the war is being fought.\n\nUkraine\u2019s expertise in drone warfare, developed during three years of fighting, has changed the nature of the conflict. Oleksandr Khomiak, who runs Drone Space Labs, believes it would now be impossible for Russia to mount an assault on Kyiv of the sort that Putin attempted at the beginning of the war. Any large concentration of troops or tanks would be decimated by Ukrainian drone attacks.\n\nThe impact of drones, manufactured in Ukraine, largely accounts for the shocking losses that Russia has taken over the past year. Western sources reckon that Russia lost 400,000 troops killed or wounded and gained just 0.5 per cent of Ukrainian land in return.\n\nThe snag is that the Ukrainian military uses Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink service to help connect and fly their drones. American intelligence also provides Ukraine with real-time information that helps identify targets. Those services could be cut off. But Khomiak believes that \u2014 with European assistance and domestic expertise \u2014 Ukraine could find workarounds to keep fighting.\n\nRather than physically conquering all of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s preferred outcome at this point is probably the installation of a pro-Moscow puppet government in Kyiv. That is why Putin \u2014 with Trump\u2019s support \u2014 is pressing for elections in Ukraine. But even massive Russian interference might not be enough to deprive Zelenskyy of victory in a vote. Trump has inadvertently given the Ukrainian president a huge boost in the opinion polls.\n\nBy standing up to Trump and Vance in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy once again demonstrated that he is capable of withstanding pressures that would crush other leaders. Trump and Vance enjoyed playing the tough guys on home turf. But Zelenskyy is the real thing. He stayed in Kyiv, when Russian forces were closing in and the city was under bombardment. Vance, by contrast, chose to move to an undisclosed location when confronted with a few hecklers on a skiing trip this weekend (a decision the vice-president\u2019s office says preceded the protests).\n\nThe western imagination \u2014 and its approach to the war \u2014 is still understandably haunted by the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban in 2021. But Ukraine is not Afghanistan and Kyiv is not Kabul. Zelenskyy\u2019s nation is in a perilous situation. But with Europe\u2019s help, it can stay in the fight long enough to achieve a real peace \u2014 one that guarantees its independence and sovereignty.",

Recent Western reporting linking the Russian rate of advance in September 2024 with Russian advances at the start of the war is highly misleading.[1] \n\nISW assesses that Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 1,265 square kilometers per day in March 2022\u2014roughly 90 times the roughly 14 square kilometers that ISW calculates that Russian forces have taken per day in September 2024. Rapid Russian advances deep into Ukrainian territory, including the temporary seizure of large portions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv oblasts characterized the first month of the Russian full-scale invasion, whereas more recent Russian advances have been characterized by small-scale, localized, tactical advances.[2] \n\nRussian forces have been making gains in eastern Ukraine recently, but comparing those gains to the initial deep Russian penetration into Ukraine at the start of the war misleadingly frames these most recent advances. For example, Russian forces seized the settlement of Vuhledar as of October 1, 2024, have continued to advance north and northwest of Vuhledar, and have made significant tactical gains in and near Selydove (southeast of Pokrovsk) over the course of the past week.[3] \n\nThese respective advances are tactically significant but do not represent a general increase in the pace of Russian advances across the frontline, much of which remains relatively stagnant, nor are they within two orders of magnitude of the rate of Russian advance in the first stage of the war.[4] \n\nThe current rate of Russian advances is consistent, rather, with ISW's recent assessment that the Russian command has likely ordered Russian forces to significantly increase their tempo of mechanized attacks throughout the theater before the full onset of muddy ground conditions in the fall months. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-29-2024",

And there are terrorist attacks from pkk from the border [which sometimes terrorist organization (when they commit a act of terrorism on Germany) and sometimes not (when they assault on T\u00fcrkiye)] and US aiding them with air supplies with helis. So our view is anything could happen with that country's government. Similar approach is on Turks view on EU as well. For the past 600+ years Turks are not east oriented, they are focused to the west. And for the past 200 years it seems Turks are or trying to walk on the West's line. Like, this is not for pleasing anyone, it's about what are the Turkish dynamics are. And yet backstabbed multiple times trough the history from many countries from the west. Which is most observable on topic of anti terrorism.\n\nDoes this change how Turkish people view themselves? No, view is still *part* of the west. This is independent from who runs on the government or what they do. \nDoes this effect Turks view on EU? ofc. For instance after the recent events about Ukraine we hear here and there debates on The Republic and its membership to EU. I'm not seeing its happening and probably a large partion of Turks don't wants it because of untrust.",

Not dismissing the sacrifices made by European or Canadian countries here, but it seems nearly everyone on this planet doesn't understand the deal, which is why we're having this \"conflict\" to begin with. \n\nNote, I didn't either until recently so allow me to explain. \n\nThe deal: America provides the physical and maritime security for Europe as well as allowing access to the American domestic market (largest in the world), in exchange America gets to call upon its allies to help fight its wars. \n\nThis deal was specifically agreed upon to counter the USSR. \n\nThat's the deal. It's a security deal for America, and an economic deal for everyone else. Only now it doesn't make a whole lot of sense because the USSR fell 30 years ago. And now we're seeing that fall apart in real time. \n\nFor instance, when Germany orders a shipment of car parts from China to build its BMW's, it's the US Navy that guarantees it gets there. That never existed prior to WW2. \n\nSo, betrayal? Not really. And again, not diminishing the sacrifices of the brave men who fought. I knew a lot of men my age get ducked up from being in that stupid war.  If it wasn't for my own personal medical condition I'd probably be in a coffin myself. But I would hardly consider Europeans being screwed over. \n\nThe deal no longer makes sense. This was always going to happen. Not saying I like what I'm seeing, but it was always going to happen.",
