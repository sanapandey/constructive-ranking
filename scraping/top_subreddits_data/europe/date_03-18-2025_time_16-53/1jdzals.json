This while he attacks Canada, Mexico, Greenland, and any other targets he wants. This will also see China take the Pacific, something Shitler doesn\u2019t care about. Good luck US islands. Those cost too much to maintain, never mind the fact a chain is a state (Hawaii), it\u2019s blue anyway. \n\nHe\u2019s hoping both Africa and South America stay as fragmented as they are to keep them out of this fight until he is ready to attack them next. This is a reason he hasn\u2019t mentioned Brazil or its former leader and his \u201cally\u201d. To keep them out of this. As South Africa is resisting and plays a major role in what would look like a united southern continent thus has been a touch and go. Just enough to insure instability in the region. \n\nWild cards still exist. Australia is a Chinese target, but also an aid draw for Europe. Having dropped French subs for a non existent US one they won\u2019t get from Shitler. The French should start production for this fast as a prelude to the US abandoning this contract. India with its own issues with China and Pakistan present some war tones. \n\nI think that if China and India can come to terms, then India may go aggressor into the Middle East again. That current situation would prevent China southern expansion as much. This is a toss up. Finally, current Russian weakness has presented a tantalizing opportunity should shit go down as China has wanted much of that eastern sections for some time. The current visible weakness of Russia with Ukraine only entices the situation.",

I was so excited to partake in the culture, try my very bad French and experience a nice afternoon along the coast.\u00a0\n\n\nI hate American Exceptionalism and propaganda with a passion. It's just so disgusting.\u00a0\n\n\nThankfully all my other American friends and family are very grateful, slightly embarrassed by their lack of knowledge of other cultures, and very willing to do as the Romans do wherever they go. They are very humble tourists. I have since taught many of them to use their indoor voices while in public haha.",

Voting is split up between many different municipalities with each state having its own bullshit rules, with so many of them actively looking to prevent people from voting. Registering to vote can be a pain and require presentation of an ID, which you have to pay for in the US. Then there's the way the electoral college works, which discourages a LOT of people from voting. So many liberals that live in conservative areas just don't vote because it would be \"pointless\" for them. Ask yourself, if you were living paycheck to paycheck and $100 was a big ask on your bills, would you spend it to be able to vote when there was basically no hope of your district flipping? My entire state is so red that it was called for Trump with 0% of the precincts reporting. The last time a democrat was elected the republican crooks got so mad they jerrymandered the fuck out of the districts to ensure it couldn't ever happen again.\n\nThis isn't even counting how much misinformation and disinformation is out there. A LOT of people who voted for Trump voted based on not knowing what was really going on. Our media has been unfaithful to the country for awhile and has sane-washed all the bullshit or just outright ignored it to the point where many people who would otherwise have voted against him were convinced to vote for him or sit home.\n\nThere is a troubling amount of people who do support this nonsense but it's nowhere near the majority.",

When the republicans push the country to the right and democrats don't pull it back to the left, it's easy to see why voters can feel unenthused and that democrats haven't earned their vote. Add on not understanding the depths of depravity this kind of incoming administration is capable of, it becomes understandable how a voter would choose their right not to vote. \n\nI'm sure plenty didn't because they're checked out, don't think politics effects them, etc. They may even support trump. Or they may have supported kamala and assumed there were enough votes and didn't need to put in the effort (very American mindset). There's also voter ID laws, not getting off work to vote, etc. I don't subscribe to the blueanon voter fraud stuff, but hey, con artists are in charge now, so why not? lol. \n\nTLDR: I don't fully blame those who didn't vote. \n\nAt the end of the day, America produced the world's next Hitler, so please tariff, sanction, boycott, build up the EU's army.

You have 1/3rd that is either unable to vote due to disenfranchisement, accessibility (thanks, politicians) or they don't feel represented by these rich candidates pushed by the parties because they never see the benefits of their policies. Then you got the 1/3rd who've had all their anger and hatred redirected towards the other 2/3rds because they were convinced it was in their best interests and they voted in the guy who told them everything they wanted to hear. Finally, you have the 1/3rd that sits on their hands 95% of the election cycle and then pats themselves on the back when it comes time to vote, as if that's all they needed to do to make a difference, while the 1/3rd they blame for ruining the country is being organized and proactive in their efforts.\n\nYou're all on the shit now and you aren't coming out of it unless you can learn to work together.",

I feel that both major parties have completely failed in providing even remotely competent leadership options in recent cycles. You're either voting to eat a shit sandwich or a turd burger.\n\nI, like most Americans, are in the middle politically. Unfortunately the far right and far left extremists on both sides are the loudest and the dumbest.\n\nI like some Democrat policies and dislike others.  I like some Republican policies and dislike others. It just so happens the Libertarian party aligns most closely with my views, so that's the way I roll. I'm not going to sacrifice my beliefs and perpetuate the political power status quo by \"voting against\". That divisiveness is how both parties have stayed in power so long.  In reality,  we have a ton of checks and balances and everything will be fine.  Congress will shift back to being Democrat controlled in mid terms next year and Trump will be gone in '28 if he doesn't get shot first because of his mouth. I'm really curious what both Dem and GOP will do for the 2028 elections.\n\nIt's funny when Republicans win,  my Democrat friends yell at me about my wasted vote and vice versa when Democrats win.  The funny thing is, most of those friends align with Libertarian views.  They are just so scared of \"the other guy\" winning that instead of voting for whom they align with most,  they vote against someone instead. How about we change that and force both sides to be better? The straight ticket voters for either side are the worst imo. At least do some research on the individual candidates. \n\nAlso,  take the Reddit fear mongering echo chamber with a grain of salt.",

It sucks, sure, but look, you ain't ever going to best or diminish this man's power or ego, nor break through the cognitive dissonance of his cult of personality that his supporters live to breath without causing them pain. The threat of Trump, and an authoritarian America, will never go away by placating him. \n\nIt will not go away by allowing him to claim wins from this, that economic policy, where it's a zero-sum game where there can be no winners, winners. There must be a loser. And any win that Trump claims is just further encasing himself in protection and reverence from his base and his party of spineless politicians, who will do and say anything to maintain power.\n\nI mean, we all know this by now. The GOP, not just Trump, needs to lie to breath, and they have been turning that way since Obama was first inaugurated in 2009.\n\nIf people give into Trump thinning that will sate him - when has it ever? Furthermore, it will empower and enable him further, both domestically and in foreign policy, and his base of voters, as well as the \"independents\" who voted for him, will swallow up every lie and justification put forth by the Trump admin of him saying his way is right.\n\nThat will not break this madness here. He has to be weakened and shown to be the Emperor wearing no clothes. Otherwise, my people will never breakaway from him and the GOP to realize the consequences and con artistry they have been subject to. We have to feel economic pain to *know tariffs are price increases/tax hikes for consumers*. \n\nThe tariff issue happened during his first term, in that people pointed out it would affect pricing, and of course they denied it, and when companies began linking price increases to tariffs, Trump went ballistic and would attack them publicly on Twitter. It honestly also undermined a lot of warnings on tariffs as a result, because companies then became afraid to piss him off and be called out for rightfully increasing prices to accommodate costs. This is one major reason the price hikes with the pandemic were so steep - it was perfect cover to *finally* account for the tariffs costs first, then the supply chain disruption cost that was then hitting.\n\nYou will find examples of how it failed last time from American MAGA or independents who were tricked into voting Trump based on this premise - it didn't happen in his first term! It is used again and again, both during the election and since, that none of this bad regarding his policies and who he appoints to his admin/what he's permitted to do, came to pass the first time. That is a big red flag, and one reason why he got some votes this election.",

He was talking about building massive camps to house people for deportation without trial or cause. Sound familiar?\n\nHarris on the otherhand has followed the law and you know not threatened allied nations that stood by the US at their lowest point and went to war to help them. \n\nBut yea sure, delude yourself by spreading misinformation that Harris is far left and wouldnt have been better.

Almost all of them are ok with the orange man (and don't give me the s*** with \"but not all of them voted for him\" because: see Serbia, see Greece, see Georgia (and see most of the citizens of democratic European nations during the last decade) and ask yourself: where are the protests in the \"land of the free\"? They would organize themselves to protest against police violence or abortion (so they can do it), but when it comes to politics, they'd rather wait for midterms to bribe (donate) to the local politician and preferred party, and go to some rallies called by some insignificat senator or congressman, senator or congressman that in dire times would just hide in his oversized suv). There are way too few american citizens today to really feel sorry. It is the path they've chosen (willful or out of ignorance).",

American individualism at work yet again lmao, our chronic allergy to collectivism is going to kill this country very soon if it hasn\u2019t already. \n\nI don\u2019t like the Democrats in their current form either but we had a choice between terminal cancer or chemo and we chose the fucking cancer, because we\u2019re idiots.",

The quality of our eggs is likely superior\n\nLet the Muricans prop up our farmers by paying 150% to 200% what we pay, its a win win\n\nBig brain move would be to simultaneously increase animal care regulation. New fancy German farms and the Americans will pay for it!\n\n I like money and helping our farmers more than owning rednecks. Not that I have a problem with owning rednecks, of course.\n\nEdit: I guess I will have to answer that repeatedly, so I'll do it just once as an Edit. If you are afraid of rising prices: Keep in mind that the argument of exports increasing local prices can be made wherever wie have a comparative advantage over countries with wealthy buyers. Should wie stop exporting cars, high tech, medicine etc then, too?\n\nThis application of zero-sum thinking in trade is exactly what the US are doing und er Trump, and look how this works out for them\n\nEdit: Simple example: Let's say, German farmers produce 6 eggs for 1 Eur. German consumers are willing to pay 2 Eur. Now the Muricans come long, willing to pay 3 Eur.\n\nWhat will a farmer do? Sell to Muricans first. What if the Muricans manage to clear the whole market? In the short term, Germans will face price hikes. In the long term its still profitable to supply Germans *in addition* to Muricans, so production would be expanded accordingly. So in the long term we end up with financially more robust farms, and larger local supply, thus more safe and stable food supply for Europe. Typical free trade win-win. The real world outcome would be nowhere close to Muricans clearing our market, though...we would just implement some.export quota, most likely. In the long term, we would get *CHEAPER* eggs. This is what enemies of free trade argue against just so the short term price remains potentially lower. Sounds surprisingly close to Trumps economic thinking, doesn't it? Short sighted thinking.\n\nUnfortunately, in times of Tiktok, noone is willing to bet on the long-term. Which has led to this moronic egg debate, do begin with.\n\nAlso, thanks to trade barriers we already pay more for food than the globally lowest possible. Don't believe the current prices are automatically the best possible.",

He says the invitation to court never reached him since he moved, i don't know what the law says in such cases but it obviously cannot be that easy to avoid punishment since it would basically allow everybody to avoid any type of punishment just by moving to a new place, unless the cops are actively looking for you.\n\nYou don't like it but all those people misbehaved, broke rules and expected to get away with it since said rules are never really enfored in Germany.

Then the opposition got splintered and didn't agree on how to oppose, got isolated, and got picked off by the government one by one. There's still opposition but all of this is obviously not really reported a lot, and certainly not televised.\n\nIn the USA it's TV and social media. And still half the people voted against Trump. They didn't do nothing. They just had hope in democracy. Because if you give up hope on that, nonviolence is done for. There's not a thing wrong with the people who did that, he *could* have lost, you know? They were wrong, and the democratic process is in question as well, but they did not sit idly by and watched it happen. They just bet on the wrong horse - or maybe they didn't, only time will tell how it will go down. Revolution is scary too, it's messy, and frequently perfect for opportunists.\n\nAssuming you're European, what do you do in your country? I'm sure there's a rising far right force in your country as well. You may be protesting it, you may have voted for it. Many Americans do the same.

                    "body": "The whole \"quality of food in America being worse\" is a myth.  Nutritionally and taste wise, they are the same.  Experiments with blind taste tests have been done on that.  The difference is that America washes its eggs and many other countries do not, and that just reflects how much they trust the population and fear of lawsuits.  Unwashed eggs have a protective shell, but they need to be washed before cracking so the outside does not get in, since they come out of a chicken's butt.  Washed eggs means you don't have to rely on people remembering to wash them themselves.  There's pros and cons, but washed eggs aren't toxic.  They just need to be refrigerated\n\nI've been all around the world and American produce is really good.  The problem is Americans and our eating habits.  People love to eat junk and just eat way too much food.  Producing a lot of great fruits and vegetables means nothing if people are just going to eat 3 cheeseburgers or a giant plate of fettucine alfredo instead.  The UK is the fattest country in Europe and I think it's probably because of some cultural similarities to America.\n\nAnd speaking of chemicals and Japan, Japan uses by far the most pesticides (followed by China) because they want their produce to look perfect.",

The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions. The Kremlin\u2019s idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls. Its Moscow can feel like an oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime.\u201d\n\u2015 Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, **year 2014**",

They don't have a history of being logical or smart. Elon Musk is the exception, and a South African white supremacist is not better.   \n\n\nThe black Great Migration(1910s-1970s) started because of how poorly white southerners treated black southerners. Hangings, harassment, etc etc. When black people started to leave the area, white southerners began to threaten them with.....hangings, harassment, etc etc.\n\nSuffice to say, Trump and co expected things to go better. In their eyes, Europe needs them, not the other way around. Nothing they said was wrong, and if it was, it wasn't that bad. And if it was that bad, well Europe should get over it anyway because they deserved it.\n\nThere is no logic here. Only hate and entitlement.",

So treatment of eggs are not the same and the production lines are not set up for it. Also, just the transport of eggs is an issue. You would have to fly them to the US - meaning they would cost a buttload just in transport.\n\nIf there is business to be done, I'm sure someone will jump on the opportunity, but it really is a case of \"incompatible\" markeds with different regulations that no one saw a reason to 'align' before now.

Am I that \"we\" and if so, who am I being sold to? The founders thought and fought for language which I now participate, so who is this \"we\"?\n\nLet me tell you something about this \"we, the people\" subscribed here in America. It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",
