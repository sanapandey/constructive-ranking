Especially since their takeover and becoming an US entity.\n\n>Data sovereignty for backups is irrelevant, since if you're going to use a cloud solution, you are always going to encrypt the backups in transfer and at rest, though depending on the capabilites.\n\nAnd here we go, thanks for showing you only have the simplest of understanding on the matter. Encryption is crucial, but it's not a catch-all solution, especially when it comes to long-term data protection. While encrypting backups in transit and at rest adds a layer of security (and is expected, not sure why you are acting as if it wasn't), it doesn\u2019t address the fundamental issue of who has access to the decryption keys or jurisdiction over the data. Over time, encryption methods can also become vulnerable to advancements in computing, like quantum computing, which might render them less secure. Data sovereignty ensures that, even with encryption, you're not handing over control to jurisdictions with less stringent protections.\n\n>Irrelevant, by that logic your data is also insecure in European Data centers.\n\nIt is, but a lot less so due to data laws in the EU vs the USA. So not at all irrelevant, you just have no recourse to argue otherwise.",

I'm the person who has those decryption keys?\nSomeone getting their hands on my encrypted data isn't going to worry me the slightest, it's useless to them. Your arguing that stuff \"may\" happen in the future which \"may\" compromise these setups is a reach.\n\nUS companies operating in Europe must follow European laws (either EU, or European country or both). If these companies can violate that law without issues, what's preventing European countries from doing the same?",
