Last Saturday, they had over 800 000 people marching to their capitol - more than 12% of their whole population. Farmers arrived with their tractors to block traffic & safeguard the march.\n\nIt was live streamed to YouTube with drone shots & cameras on ground, to discourage their militaristic police forces to start violence, and to show the world how big the protests really are (Serbian government still refuses to acknowledge how many there were, downplaying the official count but the footage speaks for itself).\n\nGovernment *still* used illegal force on protestors, while they were having a 15 minutes silence to honor the victims of the bridge collapse. You think that'll stop them from gathering the next weekend? Or the next? Serbians overthrew a tyrant just 25 years ago. They still remember how it's done.",

If I disliked what the people I got into parliament were doing, I'd go out and let them know I want them to change course.

What I mean to say is the protest should not be organised by the Democrats, it should be organised by _the people_. So that everyone who disagrees with what's going on can join.\n\nAlso, you don't have to find a singular goal to base your protest on. The protests in Greece started because of a covered up train crash, but they're much more than that now. The protests in Serbia started because of a collapsed train station, but they're much more than that now. People are now protesting against corruption and the government, and many of them would never have gone out on the streets had others not gone out for different reasons.\n\nI can give you an example I know more about, so you can see how vastly different reasons for participating in the same protest can be:\n\n[Bulgarian protests in 2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Bulgarian_protests) caused by:\n\n\u2022 Prosecutor's Office raiding the Presidency of Bulgaria\n\n\u2022 Government mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n\u2022 Ahmed Dogan and Delyan Peevski being guarded by the National Service for Protection\n\n\u2022 Political corruption and misuse of EU funds\n\n\u2022 State capture\n\n\u2022 Lack of media freedom and transparency\n\n\u2022 Lack of adequate environmental protection\n\n\u2022 Systemic electoral fraud",

And why you call antisystemic a democratic expression such as a protest?\n\n\n>Symbol of the protests is a mom whose child died yet so far she has talked against our prime minister for the train colliding, has attacked the head of our justice system, has made off court statement against our president of parliament after she demanded to see him alongside a lawyer, and has also criticized our head of state (president).\n\n\nWe talk against the government and the \"justice\" system as well. More than half a million people cried against them. If they were the ones elected, they are responsible too. Also the head of the justice system (not ours, theirs) was 17 places from the first and is appointed by the ministry cabinet, the only one in the EU. So much for our independent justice. We stand beside Maria Karystianoy and all the victims' families!\n\n\n>The protests are driven by unsatisfied people who never saw their living standards rise post crisis, they don\u2019t care about reforming the rail, the person who was probably placed there via client state manner is almost not blamed for putting two trains on the same line and the doctors who gave fake leave for the other stuff who should be there working are not blamed either!\n\n\nThe client state was the nd state, who didn't even obey their own laws and put him there, the trains were **understaffed** (1/4 of those who were needed according to the organisation chart and the official resolution - we have 1 worker per 2km, while in the EU they have 2 workers per km) and people must take a leave sometime. Don't repeat the government's propaganda about the bad lazy public sector, you saw the wonders of the privatised Hellenic trains!!\n\n\n>There is a demand to dismantle laws that protect the parliament people and ministers. The mob has made a decision and don\u2019t care about what the justice decides, it\u2019s delegitimised to them along with all high ranking officials. People call the government assassins (to a less degree some of the opposition too). Situation is worrying but that very same people the immediate day after the protests went on posting pictures from the carnival!!! Essentially ridiculing the whole protests. There was already a bomb set in a government politician\u2019s house and there\u2019s also foreign interference via bots who polarise more the situation.\n\n\nYes. The law about the Ministers' responsibility must change and they should be accountable more than any other. Also the highest judges must not be appointed by the government, it is a farce. The media freedom must be ensured (last in the EU!)\n\n\nIf you think that a person cannot go to a protest and the next day in a carnival then you don't exercise one of the basic democratic rights, the protest. They are a part of our lives, people are not hypocrites when they continue to live the next day. Were more than half a million people trying to destabilise our emperor? Rage against those who bury in cement the remains of our dead. But also for making the greek state the ridicule of the eu parliament, when one by one we get shamed for the state of our democracy and freedom. Even if they keep up the propaganda, as you saw almost a million people worldwide was outraged for their cover up.",

The crowd demanded justice in the sense of the Nemesis, they would be idiots (\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) if they didn't care that our institutions have become puppets.

The media as always tries to sensationalise it but, to be honest, as I said a Predator or a Novartis didn't wake up the people. They needed 57 dead to realise the level of corruption. On the contrary, maybe you didn't notice but our dear pm in his parliamentary speach a week after the protests, he promised to change the law in Constitution of both the Minister's responsibility and the appointment of the highest judges. I guess he was pressured by the EU as well, who repeatedly has warned us before.\n\n>The climate wasn\u2019t one of demanding reforms (firing inefficient workers who got a job through client state).\n\nDo you understand that the ND, aka our government, who was voted with the promise of \u0386\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 - \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 was the one that put this man in the train station? And they dismissed the age and they changed the law afterwards, leaving him in an understaffed (1/4 you conveniently ignore my arguments...) station alone? Who are going to protest against, the workers? Didn't we vote them to bring clarity and the best, who is to blame for? Believe me, the education and health are underfunded and understaffed and they blame the few workers with evaluation (!!) and you believe them. So to whom should we protest of not our government?\n\n>You in fact completely skipped that part and tried to justify this mob court into something democratic.

Because I think this is the exact opposite, they cannot or don't want to protest.",

Those protests contained among the peaceful people (which you so desperately try to mention every time because you have the prejudice I will talk about the far left mob who tried to have a beef with the police) many other angry people who want to take the courts on the streets and skip rule of law altogether. That\u2019s unacceptable. We\u2019re in a democracy with rule of law. You protest for the trains not to destroy our institutions. That\u2019s fascism.",

They same government that had promoted him without evaluation? Should we blame the worker as well for not hiring another station manager ti work with him, as at least two persons should be there?  Why didn't they pay attention to the train worker's syndicate warnings? Do we need to fire them too?\n\nWhat do you mean I skipped the unsettling part about justice? Which part? Wasn't I the one who brought it up? Do explain.\n\nThat's not fascism. Protests are democracy as all the constitutions and democracies prove it. Can you claim otherwise?
