Srsly I fucking love the idea.\n\nI know pulling up to Pride is now already illegal, but there\u2019s a difference between breaking a new law to stand up for personal freedom and breaking an old law to avoid paying a fine.\n\nOn the other hand, wearing sunglasses, a hat, growing a beard (or putting on a fake beard - nobody will try to rip that off), putting on some makeup, wearing a hoodie are all legal ways of covering your face. I don\u2019t think AI is THAT smart yet. Even if it does recognize you, you can still say you are not on that picture and there\u2019s no way to prove it. Also, if you are still charged for covering your face, it\u2019s a lot more defendable, than putting on a ski mask for example :D\n\nIf you are Hungarian, I found this source about Hungarian demonstration law:\nhttps://helsinkifigyelo.444.hu/2023/05/16/kerdezz-felelek-a-tuntetesekrol-es-rendori-intezkedesekrol",

Literally it's scary how similar it is to what was going on in Hungary from 2016-ish.\n\nRealisticly Hungarys last chance to vote for someone else was back in 2014, because after that they slowly siezed control through the media. Sadly here were barely any viable candidate or party who were strong enough back then. There was another good chance, well more like OK it'll do if there is nothing else, in 2022. The whole opposition came together only to start an internal conflict with the leading Left party, DK, and fell apart within 2 days before the election. Massive smear campaing from Fidesz also helped to turn people away from them.  \nBut it was laughable really, shows how stupid the average hungarian is. The main thing was, they managed to convince people that Peter M\u00e1rki-Zay (opp. leader) will send Hungarian troops to Ukraine (to aid Ukraine of course) if he gets elected. Such a stupid, blatant lie, anyone who knows how NATO works knows it's impossible to do so. Besides he was talking about sending support and aid like the rest of civilized Europe did, but nobody cared for the truth once they heard the propaganda. Fearmongering is one fucking effective weapon, especially if state-owned media is spewing it 24/7. So effective I even had to argue with family members, like my own father, and I couldn't convince him.   \nI also had a friend, who voted for Fidesz just because she was afraid that the rest of our friends group (aged between 22-30) will get drafted to the frontlines. Fucking unbeliveable, but it's true. I fucking hate them for brainwashing my family and friends.",

That still leaves the question is it against the law though? I know everyone has different limits but a swimsuit for example certainly isn't, even though it doesn't shy away from showing skin. Or do you go into the water in a coat and sweatpants when you visit the beach?\n\nEqually leather is not so different, and last year the leaders of kink communities emphasized that even if you wear a harness please wear a shirt under and dress acceptably. And to no one's surprise they actually listened and dressed appropriately.\n\nFeel free to continue lying about this demonstration called Pride all you want, but stop dehumanizing thousands for two or three assholes, it makes no sense. At this point those could very well be people of the government trying to make others like you believe in their propaganda.",

It's 97% normal people celebrating the progress of their minority group (maybe dressed more colorful than usual), and having a once a year opportunity to be surrounded by other people who have similar struggles and allies. One of those events where you don't have to be paranoid about homophobia when you mingle. \n\nThe \"worst\" I've seen is just some dudes dressed in more revealing leather outfits, but in all honesty is not anything worse than you'll see some female artists wearing on television or what how some women dress up to go clubbing (which I also have nothing against really). \n\nBesides, if you were really just against vibrators or condoms existing, you could just ban public displays of such items altogether (which I personally would find kind of stupid) without specifically banning Pride.\n\nIt would be *so easy* to just say \"It's illegal to promote sex related accessories in public\" and still allow Prides to go on.\n\nBut the fact that they're not making such laws, but specifically targeting a celebration of minority rights, shows you what the true intentions actually are. Not matter what excuses they want to use.",

Hungary already pivoted HARD to cooperation with China and has massive investment from China there building up everything.\n\nYou do realize EU negotiating power is very low there?\n\nWith what is happening in Romania and then a squeeze on Hungary, it will tarnish the reputation of EU.\n\nLike I said, it will provoke escalation that goes into 'states rights'. Basically EU will have to escalate A LOT if it wants to get rid of this situation.\n\nAnd like I said, an escalation will have influence on the markets and EU economy is already slipping down.\n\nAnd no, EU does not have a lot of capital especially usable capital.\n\nhttps://howmuch.net/articles/international-liquidity-country\n\nLook at this.

EU can't make a decision 'this is done with this'.\n\nLosing UK was bad enough but then came all the covid mesures that were unpopular and did a number on the economy, then Ukraine (self)sanctions, now militarization spending to show evil Putler and Musk... and now this is starting.

He clearly stated that this law to ban Pride can't be valid based on our constitution and that freedom of assembly is the right of every Hungarian. If you look at his politics, he stays out of topics that Orban throws around to piss off people and control the narrative. He is focused on general issues and that's why he is successful. But he can't be fighting in every direction and we know what propaganda did to the narratives around the Pride. Pride is just a topic for FIDESZ that they can trigger. We can't let them ban it. But they only do it to cause chaos.  \n\nI feel like guys like you are the same as in the US who stayed away from voting for the Dems out of spite of what has happened in Gaza, and not thinking about how Trump will be a thousand worse for those poor people.\n\nI will be marching on the Pride, because this is something we have to do to fight. But honestly, this is just a drop in a bucket in terms of issues in Hungary. If you, or anybody else is willing to stick with Orban just because his alternative knows how propaganda is working in Hungary then you guys deserve to have Orban.",

You are making some very wild assumptions about other people's sexual orientation - a mistake you'd hardly make if you were what you claimed to be.

The differences lie in how they approach tradition, economic policy, social values, and the role of government. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\nLiberal conservatism combines elements of classical liberalism\u2014such as support for free markets, limited government, and individual rights\u2014with a conservative appreciation for tradition, social stability, and gradual change. It tends to favor preserving established institutions (like family, religion, or national identity) while still embracing economic freedom and personal autonomy. Think of it as a pragmatic middle ground: it\u2019s skeptical of radical upheaval but open to reform when it\u2019s practical. Historically, figures like Edmund Burke are associated with this mindset\u2014he championed liberty but distrusted revolutionary overhauls like the French Revolution.\n\nLiberalism, in its broader sense (especially modern or social liberalism), prioritizes individual freedom and equality above all, often advocating for progressive change to achieve those ends. It\u2019s more willing to challenge tradition or authority if they\u2019re seen as barriers to rights or justice. Economically, it can range from supporting free markets (classical liberalism) to endorsing government intervention to reduce inequality (social liberalism, as seen in, say, the New Deal or European welfare states). Socially, it leans toward secularism and cosmopolitanism, often pushing for rapid shifts on issues like gender, race, or cultural norms.\n\nKey differences:\n- **Tradition vs. Progress**: Liberal conservatives value tradition as a stabilizing force and prefer incremental change; liberals are more likely to see tradition as negotiable and push for bolder reforms.\n- **Government Role**: Liberal conservatives want limited government but might back it to uphold social order or moral standards (e.g., law enforcement or cultural heritage). Liberals, especially social liberals, often see government as a tool to advance equality or protect rights, even if it means expanding its scope.\n- **Economics**: Both can support capitalism, but liberal conservatives are more consistently laissez-faire, while modern liberals might favor regulation or redistribution to address disparities.\n- **Social Issues**: Liberal conservatives might resist rapid shifts (e.g., on marriage or immigration) to preserve cohesion; liberals tend to embrace them as expansions of freedom.\n\nIn practice, liberal conservatism might look like a politician who defends free trade and deregulation but also supports traditional family values\u2014say, a moderate Republican or a Tory in the UK. Liberalism might manifest as someone advocating for universal healthcare and secular policies, like a progressive Democrat or a European social democrat. The line can blur, especially in specific contexts, but the core tension is between balancing liberty with stability (liberal conservatism) and prioritizing liberty with equality (liberalism).",

Just admit you\u2019re wrong, take this as a lesson, and go about your day.\n\nHere are five clear differences between liberal conservatism and liberalism, distilled for clarity:\n\n1. **Approach to Tradition**:  \n   - **Liberal Conservatism**: Values tradition as a source of stability and continuity, only adapting it when necessary. It sees institutions like family or religion as worth preserving.  \n   - **Liberalism**: Views tradition as secondary to individual rights and progress, willing to challenge or discard it if it conflicts with equality or freedom.\n\n2. **Pace of Change**:  \n   - **Liberal Conservatism**: Prefers gradual, incremental reforms to maintain social cohesion and avoid disruption.  \n   - **Liberalism**: Embraces faster, sometimes radical change to advance liberty or address injustices, less concerned with preserving the status quo.\n\n3. **Role of Government**:  \n   - **Liberal Conservatism**: Favors limited government but may support its use to uphold order, moral standards, or national identity (e.g., strong defense or cultural policies).  \n   - **Liberalism**: Often advocates a more active government, especially in social liberalism, to protect rights, reduce inequality, or provide welfare (e.g., healthcare programs).\n\n4. **Economic Priorities**:  \n   - **Liberal Conservatism**: Strongly committed to free markets and minimal regulation, seeing them as tied to both liberty and tradition (e.g., property rights).  \n   - **Liberalism**: Can support free markets (classical liberalism) but often backs intervention\u2014taxes, subsidies, or regulations\u2014to correct disparities or ensure fairness.\n\n5. **Social Values**:  \n   - **Liberal Conservatism**: Tends to defend traditional social norms (e.g., on marriage or immigration) to preserve societal unity, though it\u2019s not as rigid as pure conservatism.  \n   - **Liberalism**: Pushes for progressive shifts (e.g., secularism, diversity, gender equality), prioritizing individual choice over collective norms.\n\nThese differences highlight liberal conservatism\u2019s balancing act between liberty and stability versus liberalism\u2019s focus on liberty and equality, often at the expense of tradition.",

                    "body": "Last I checked:\n\n\\- gerrymandering\n\n\\- exploiting extensive poverty and lack of objective press in rural regions by A.) offering basic necessities (such as the infamous bag of potatoes) in exchange of votes and B.) widely (and often exclusively) distributing misleading information through biased press entities capitalising on the fact that people living in poverty have no practical access to press representing different points of view. Even if, in theory they could, they just don't have the money or if they do the education to make use of it in proper context\n\n\\- Relying on the fact that a large percentage of their voters were alive and often young during the communist era where engaging and or publicly agreeing with anything but state narrative meant a large chance of being subject to state retaliation. By making State communication synonymous with FIDESZ communication and employing similar narratives to the previous system they capitalise on elderly people who were raised with the attitude of \"just stay quiet and nod along if you don't want trouble\".\n\n\\- Changing election laws to suit them. For example since 2014 the so called Winner Compensation system is in effect, meaning that in regional mandate elections the vote difference between the party winning the regional mandate and the party receiving the second most votes is transferred to the winning party's national mandate total (of course, the other, not winning parties also receive their votes on the national level but that hardly makes a difference. ) So say in a regional district FIDESZ wins 50k to 28k against some party B. Party B then gets 28k extra votes on their national list and FIDESZ also receives an extra 22k votes on their national list. When you consider the fragmented nature of the political opposition this system can result in huge amounts of \"free\" votes for FIDESZ on the national scale since there are plenty of examples where they win with a large lead but not so many examples of opposition parties winning with large leads.\n\nAll in all, the pattern is that last time FIDESZ received \\~70% of parliamentary mandates with \\~50-55% of votes. At least on the national level, I admit, I couldn't find numbers for the local districts.\n\nEDIT: Also, the 82% (137) you mention is actually the 82% of the representatives who voted this time. FIDESZ currently holds 135 mandates, with Mi Haz\u00e1nk (an openly even more extremist party who are separate basically only in name) holding another 6 with the rest, 57 going to the failed opposition coalition with an extra mandate for german minority (199 in total). Considering those numbers I'm actually surprised there weren't more Yes votes. The fact that a large portion of opposition representatives didn't vote at all is actually not surprising, I think the idea is that because votes are only a formality (FIDESZ+Mi Haz\u00e1nk has enough mandates to do whatever they want) they aren't going to legitimise it further by taking part.",
