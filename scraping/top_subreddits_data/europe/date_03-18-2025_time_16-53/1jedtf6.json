The police officers who uncovered the corruption network within the government were jailed, and the journalists who reported on it were imprisoned as well, accused of terrorism.\n\nThe G\u00fclen movement was crushed, as it was believed to be the group behind the exposure of corruption. Now, they are blamed for everything, from terrorism to running a parallel state. Their members are rotting in prisons, while the media continues to spread propaganda against them every single day.\n\nHad Turkey taken the right path back then, we would be looking at a very different country today\u2014instead of an Iran 2.0.",
