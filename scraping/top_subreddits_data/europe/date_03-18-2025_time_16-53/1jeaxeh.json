Am I reading it correctly? Because tax brackets are a thing in france\n\nNo. the point was that if average workers are paying a 10% tax *rate*, there is plenty of room to have higher income workers pay at much higher multiples of the *rate* of the average worker - 5 times the rate was the example I used. Obviously, the higher income worker will pay much, much more than five times the *nominal* amount that the average workers pays. If he makes ten times as much and pays 5 times the rate, the higher income worker pays 50 times what the average worker pays. \n\nThe point is that the lower the tax rates on the middle/bottom end, the greater headroom there is for progressivity of taxes. If general tax rates are high, that reduces even the mathematical possibility of increases to the multiple to the *rate* that higher earners pay relatively to lower earners. \n\nThe US, for example, has lower *rates* for the highest earners than almost every other developed nation, but because tax rates in general are low in the US, taxes in the US have more room to be progressive, with the US having the most progressive tax system in the developed world. Some people think progressivity is based on how high of a rate that the highest earners pay, but it is not. It is based on the difference in rates (not nominal amounts) that the highest earners pay relative to the lowest earners. I.e., what is the share of the tax burden of the highest earners relative to their share of income.",

In our societies, the rich hold the most political power because they have the capital to lobby for their interests. Once the companies grow large enough (form a monopoly or cartel), they will have a significant portion of the economy by the balls. In other words, enough money to push for their interests or imply they'll fuck the economy by pulling out if politicians don't concede.\n\nWhen the economy gets tough, the government will always side with the rich and implement austerity measures and bail out the company owners (while leaving everyone else jobless). This is a feature, not something random. If you're part of the ruling class, you wait until the economy tanks (and it always will every ten or so years), and swoop in to demand more tax cuts (which the government will fund through austerity) and force the government to expend a significant amount of wealth to shock the economy back to life.\n\nWhen it gets especially bad, they will always side with fascist figures who squash any movements that threaten the status quo. Mussolini did it, Hitler did it, and so many other European countries did it. Now we do it again, the ruling class spreads propaganda to focus our blame on minorities to get austerity-happy right-wing politicians into power. They are so effective at it that center parties turn more right-wing to attempt to snatch up the shifting voters. Any left party is simply stamped as socialist and communist, because it remains the big boogeyman word for everyone, even when those parties want to serve the interests of the average person by targeting those in power.\n\nAs long as the average person does not realise that their interest in a better life directly contradicts the interest of the ruling class (raise profit by cutting costs and increasing productivity), we will never get out of this situation and things will always get worse. You cannot combat a class that soaks up all the wealth for themselves while the average person grows poorer, unless everyone votes directly against the parties that enable them",

One of its pillars is if all the billionaires today keep one billion and give up the rest, the world will have 12000 billion usds IIRC, and that could solve many of the problems the world has today! And they will still remain billionaires!",

I mean many companies that I worked for was paid by the wealth of one wealthy investor who risked his wealth to make a  certain product reach the market. If we taxed the hell out of these billionaires I doubt these projects would exist. And the state/government is a poor spender everywhere. I mean so many people that do nothing are employed by the government. That extra income for the government would instantaneously be used to pay salaries to some people that do nothing. Romania its a good example of that. And I am tempted to think this is a universal issue.",

But let me tell you that Musk is 180 degrees from a incompetent government that hires you just to vote for a political party and you don't even have to show up to work and you still get paid. On top of that when you hit 40 you can retire and be hired again on the same job at the government. So those people take a pension + salary and they do not even work!  \nI doubt we want to punish rich people and leave this issue of a inefficient government unaddressed. These issues must be both tackled at the same time because as soon as we tax the rich, the government will use the extra money to hire these slackers on public money.",
