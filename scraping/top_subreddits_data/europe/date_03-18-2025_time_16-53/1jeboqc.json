That's how he would understand it. His mind is transactional and he focuses on what is good for him and what makes him look good. If Europe doesn't want American weapons anymore, that will make him look bad and loose a lot money. It's something to weight against whatever Putin is offering. \n\n  \nAnd thanks for the correction, I thought Turkey got their F35 back on track.",

I'm not sure where the confusion is here; F-35 is not principally an air superiority fighter, that's not what it is needed for. European 4th gen fighters are already an overmatch for everything other than Su-57 which will probably never catch up to the numbers of F-35 we already operate, so in the air to air domain there's no issue. \n\nThe problem is that we rely heavily on aerial firepower and none of our air forces have any more capability to degrade Russia's air defences than the Russian air force can degrade Ukraine's. F-35 is currently the only tool we have that can do that in a reasonable timeframe. Without it we'd be stuck lobbing glide bombs are maximum range just as Russia is.",

F-35 is by far the faster route to a credible capability - indeed it's already happening.\n\n> you can do it with cruise missiles or other precision guided munitions.\n\nIf that were true Russia would have air superiority over Ukraine.

The biggest thing Macron announced is the creation of two additional air force squadrons dedicated to France's air-based nuclear deterrent, thus doubling the amount of such squadrons France has (from 40-ish Rafale to 80-ish now with the new plan) and expanding the number of air-launched nuclear warheads accordingly.\n\nHe announced this base will be the first to receive the Rafale F5 under development (the so-called Super Rafale) in 2035. The Rafale's design would be slightly modified (it will notably get bigger) to get a new engine, far more capable new sensors, EW suite and weapons. It will be associated with a stealth UCAV as well as expendable remote carriers.... The base will therefore also be the first to receive the ASN4G hypersonic nuclear-armed cruise missile.\n\nThat's by far the most important thing today. Ordering more fighters and accelerating production rate should be a no brainer for everyone in Europe right now. Not particularly newsworthy.",
