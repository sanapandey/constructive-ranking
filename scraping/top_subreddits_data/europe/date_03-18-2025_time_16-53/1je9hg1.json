I love Canada,  i respect Canada, they've always had our backs. So then why.. also this is coming from a born and raised Texan btw, just a testament that not all southerners are mindless Trump apologists. So then,  with no health care,  non affordable housing for most,  food being well on its way to being unaffordable, or international relationships being demolished. I don't know man,  it feels like it's all going to shit insanely fast now,  more than ever. I want out, either that or we have to make a stand.  But for some reason Americans won't do it,  we all just seem to accept things getting worse and worse, and the economy has us so beat down and broke that we can't even afford to miss work to protest \ud83d\ude02.

The Kinder egg (Kinder Surprise) is an iconic product in Europe, and since the 70s, it has accompanied generations of children during their childhood. The egg is made of chocolate, the outer shell is brown milk chocolate, while the inner shell is white chocolate. Inside the egg, there is a kind of yellow container (capsule) that symbolizes the egg yolk, and inside that, there is the surprise (which were great until the 90s, but now they are disappointing.). In the 2000s, they launched the Kinder Joy (which has had low success in Europe), but it is the only one that has been marketed in the United States because the other one is illegal over there. For Europeans, the definition par antonomasia of a Kinder egg is the Kinder Surprise. The Kinder Joy is not even taken into consideration. The fact that the other one is illegal over there is quite comical for us, because over here, it\u2019s considered a product for children.",

Alot of european country's are already looking for trade deals elsewhere. Once they have new (better) deals they ain't returning. Which will fuckup america's economy massivly for a looong time.\n\nAll the damage he's doing on the ukrainian front becomes irreversible way sooner though i'd say max 3 months. If that damage becomes irreversible USA will have no ally's anymore and will have to do it alone if something bad happens.\n\nThere is already very early talks going on about what to do with NATO as by then USA will be out of it. If europe makes a new system without US thats another front u'll all be without ally's. \n\nWorst case ya'all become N korea 2.0 due to Trumps actions.",

She only asked for her $20,000 in medical costs initially, and McDonald's offered $800. \n\nMcDonald's ran a smear campaign to discredit her during the lawsuit and portray her as a moron at fault.\n>>Other documents showed that, from 1982 to 1992, McDonald's had received more than 700 reports of people burned by McDonald's coffee to varying degrees of severity, and had settled claims arising from scalding injuries for more than $500,000.[12] McDonald's quality control manager, Christopher Appleton, testified that this number of injuries was insufficient to cause the company to evaluate its practices. He argued that all foods hotter than 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C) constituted a burn hazard, and that restaurants had more pressing dangers to worry about. The plaintiffs argued that Appleton conceded that McDonald's coffee would burn the mouth and throat if consumed when served",

But that's regular trade, that's companies trying to buy eggs.\n\n\nBut eggs in the EU and US are stored differently. In the US they're washed and cooled so I guess these different regulations may lead to special inquiries which European producers cannot or don't want to meet.\n\n\nIt may also be an issue because agricultural goods in the EU are heavily subsided which normally would be answered with tariffs to protect the own market but I guess there aren't tariffs on goods that normally are not subject to being imported from the EU.",

Eggs inherently are covered in fecal matter. This is inescapable due to where eggs come from on chickens. Just cuz you can't see it doesn't mean its good for your gut. And I mean when you crack an egg open to use it. Some will slide off the rim of the egg, down the shell, into the container or pan you're using. You cannot tell me you are so good at cracking eggs that you break the laws of physics. Is 30 seconds of rinsing eggs and checking them for spoilage really that difficult for you? \n\nThere are plenty problems with eggs in America. Our logistics are so much different than Europe that it's comparing apples and oranges. We have 1 standard practice for a landmass bigger than the EU, where you guys have many checkpoints and many standard practices. This is not the problem with American eggs. The fact we will sell New England eggs to Floridians and Floridian eggs to Wisconsin is the problem. And I just made up random places, but the distances involved are the same as crossing 5 or 6 different countries instead of 1000 miles on the highway.",

If we didn't allow such large monopolization of products/services and they were instead split out into smaller regional companies then a bird flu that hits one suppliers flock(s) isn't going to completely eviscerate the market.  Sure, eggs wouldn't have been 2.00 but likely 2.50 before the bird flu.. and maybe jumped to 3 or 4.  But never to 10+ like they have.",

Am I that \"we\" and if so, who am I being sold to? The founders thought and fought for language which I now participate, so who is this \"we\"?\n\nLet me tell you something about this \"we, the people\" subscribed here in America. It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",

Denmark was always the archipelago north of German territories. Anything else that ended up in the Danish empire never became Danish, but kept its own identity and language. \n\nSchleswig-Holstein was in a union with Denmark for almost 1000 years without ever becoming fully Danish, but kept its own laws, culture and language. \n\nNorway is not Danish but Norwegian despite being part of Danish/Norwegian union  for almost 300 years. \n\nIceland is not Danish despite being part the Danish Kingdom as a Norwegian province from 1380 and then a Danish territory from 1660 until its declaration of indepence was realized in 1944.   \n\nThere are several Danish colonies in both Europe and the rest of the world that belonged to Denmark, but never became Danish.\n\nThe Faroe Islands and Greenland is still a part of Denmark, but has its own culture and language. Both got Danish legislation granting them indepence when they want to claim it. \n\nSo to summarize: Danes stink at spreading Danishness to the world. Denmark is just the Hans Christian Andersen Fairy tale land of a tiny state. Others may join the party for a short while, or even a millennium, but they still leave influenced by the Danes, but not as Danes.",
