Most Americans have no idea, but the \"liberty\" in the \"statue of liberty\" refers to the liberation of slaves after the abolition war.   Even though it became a beacon of hope to the tired, the poor and the wretched in other countries, the statue itself was originally intended as a monument to the liberation of Americans from bondage.\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/historyculture/abolition.htm\n\nIIRC, it was the largest liberation monument in the world until recently when North Korea started building some in African nations which sounds  like something from the Upside-Down but is something they really have been doing.",

These days, in the U.S., if a state or territory has a legal issue with the federal government, then the state or territory sues the U.S. government in federal court. If the lawsuit involves constitutional issues (that is, the U.S. Constitution which is the ultimate basis of U.S. law) then the lawsuit may reach all the way to the level of the Supreme Court. When they make a decision, legally speaking, it is the final ruling on the matter of law in regards to the constitutional issue at hand. Easy enough, right?\n\nWell, back in colonial times, there was no U.S. Constitution. The ultimate authority in law for the Thirteen Colonies were their respective colonial charters, each of which was different. These were contracts between the people of the colony and the King, agreed to and signed by both sides, and these charters were what gave the colonies the legal authority to exist. They detailed what rights the colony had and what rights the King had and how the two sides interacted in a legal manner. These were not uniform, and some colonies enjoyed rights that others did not. \n\nBut there was no Supreme Court back then, either. The judicial structure was entirely different, and entirely separate. If you were a citizen of Massachusetts, including the governor and legislators of Massachusetts, you could only sue in Massachusetts court. They had no access to the British court system, so they couldn't bring a formal case there. The only judicial relief they could get when Parliament overstepped their authority in regards to the rights established in the colonial charters was to petition the King. Essentially, the Virginia government, or some other colony's government wrote a letter to the King: \"Hey, the law Parliament passed is illegal. Here is the passage from the charter which shows why it is illegal. Here is precedent, etc. Now tell them to stop.\" And you'd hope the King would see your point.\n\nSo, the British point of view of the Revolutionary War was that the Thirteen Colonies were pissed off for paying too much in taxes and not being represented in government, and that's why they revolted. And the revolt was unjust because the taxes were fair and they were represented in government.\n\nBut the American point of view was that the rule of law was being violated. And it was being violated continuously, repeatedly, purposely, and egregiously. And when the colony's stream of judicial relief to these matters began to be violated as well, they revolted. They revolted so they could establish their own rule of law which *would* be respected.\n\nSo let's go back to the issues you brought up, and present them from the American side:\n\n> the granting of autonomy to the newly conquered Qu\u00e9bec which allowed them to remain Francophone, use French civil law and practice their Catholic faith openly under the Protestant British administration.\n\nOK, this has to do with the French and Indian War. Go back a little: both England/Britain and France claimed the \"Ohio Country\" which included the present states of Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. From the English side, this land belonged to the colony of Virginia, in accordance with Virginia's colonial charter. Pennsylvania's charter laid out its western border at roughly its current place, but Virginia's original western border was the Mississippi River.\n\nBefore the mid-1700s, it didn't really matter that Britain and France had overlapping land claims on the Ohio Country, since nobody had tried to settle it. But by the 1740s, there were enough people in America that interested Virginians formed a real estate company to go buy the land from the Indians and start selling it off to new settlers.\n\nTo prevent this, the French set up a series of military installations in the Ohio Country to protect their land claim. Virginia sent a regiment of the colonial militia under the command of George Washington, who was the younger brother of one of the investors in the land company. Washington had been appointed Captain of the militia by Virginia's lieutenant governor, who was yet another investor in the Ohio Company of Virginia. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts to negotiate with the French in Ohio, Washington ambushed a contingent of French soldiers in the dead of night, which started the war. And this French and Indian War, in turn, was one of the causes of the much larger Seven Years War, which nearly bankrupted Britain.\n\nGreat Britain did win the French and Indian War against the French, so it wasn't entirely a disaster. To Virginia, that meant that they now should have control of the Ohio Country, in accordance with the land boundaries set up in their colonial charter. But the King and Parliament were pissed off about the whole thing so, while organizing Quebec under English rule, they formally made the Ohio Country part of Quebec.\n\nThis pissed off Virginia lawmakers greatly, because not only did it violate the law as it was written in the Virginia colonial charter, but it kind of defeated the whole purpose as to why the Americans had fought the French and Indian War in the first place. In any case, regardless of the King's personal feelings, Virginia's legal position was that the King didn't have the authority to unilaterally give Ohio to Quebec, since the contract both had signed back in the 1600s gave that land to Virginia. But what was their legal relief? The only thing they could do was peitition the King, who said no. There was no neutral third party they could appeal to. \n\n> Another is the so called \"Intolerable Acts\" which weren't particularly intolerable by any sort of standard, they were taxes levied on the colonies to cover the cost of their defense\n\nAgain, this came down to a dispute not over the amount of taxes levied, but over the rule of law. For 140 years, Massachusetts had local authority over all tax issues, and the law had been respected that way. This is how it had been done under the original Plymouth charter, and after a re-org in 1686 revoked that charter which ended in a rebellion in Boston with the colonial governor captured, a new Massachusetts charter was issued in 1691. \n\nUnder [this new charter](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/mass07.asp), Parliament and the King of England had the right to \"impose and levy proportionable and reasonable assessments, rates, and taxes upon the estates and persons\" of Massachusetts as long as these new laws were \"issued and disposed of by warrant under the hand of the Governor of [Massachusetts] with the advice and consent of the Council [i.e., the Massachusetts colonial legislature] for our service in the necessary defence and support of our Government of [Massachusetts] and the protection and preservation of the inhabitants there\". \n\nIn other words, the only way that Parliament and the King could raise taxes on the people of Massachusetts was to get authorization from the Massachusetts government.\n\nThis is how it had worked for 140 years, and this is what the law said, as the colonists understood it. And this is how Parliament had respected it for those 140 years as well. But now after the French and Indian War, Parliament began passing a series of laws that were essentially backdoor ways to tax the Thirteen Colonies, including Massachusetts. These schemes got more and more convoluted, including the Stamp Act, the Sugar Act, and the Tea Act among them.\n\nSince Massachusetts couldn't sue, they did what they could do which was petition the King. Parliament would back off, then pass something else which again violated the charter of Massachusetts, and Massachusetts would again have to petition the King. This began to escalate to the point that Parliament began to specifically target Massachusetts, which is what some of the Intolerable Acts were.\n\nThe Boston Port Act punished Massachusetts specifically because of their reaction to the illegal Tea Act. But more egregious than that was the Massachusetts Government Act, which revoked the Massachusetts charter and brought the colony under the authority of the King.\n\nThis completely undermined the basis of the rule of law in the Thirteen Colonies. Up until then, the laws were based on the colonial charters, which were contracts between the people of the respective colonies and the King.\n\nBut with the Massachusetts Government Act, the King and Parliament were now taking the position that, \"No, these are not contracts between two sides. The King and Parliament have unilateral control over them, and they only exist because we allow them to exist.\" In other words, they weren't contracts at all. They were meaningless. They were completely one-sided. The charters existed at the pleasure of the King, and the colony's basis in law could be revoked by him, unilaterally, at any time for any reason. In a word, this was tyranny.\n\nThe Massachusetts Government Act was a shot across the bow by Parliament, meant to be a warning to the other twelve colonies to not do what Massachusetts was doing, or you would be next.\n\nInstead, the Thirteen Colonies banded together to fight this. The First Continental Congress petitioned the King for the repeal of the Intolerable Acts, making their case for why they were illegal in accordance with the colonial charters and English law. The King did not respond.\n\nThe Second Continental Congress then petitioned Parliament for their repeal, but Parliament responded that they did not recognize Congress. Send this petition thirteen times from your thirteen separate colonial governments, then we'll talk.\n\n(...To be Cont'd...)",

To remain under such authority, where no American held the right to representation in self-government, was a \u2018form of slavery\u2019 to many. The irony in using this sort of language was not lost on many British Tories, who called out these rebel hypocrites. \u201cWe are told, that the subjection of Americans may tend to the diminution of our own liberties; an event, which none but very perspicacious politicians are able to foresee. If slavery be thus fatally contagious, how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?\u201d wrote Dr. Samuel Johnson in 1775\n\nhttps://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/slavery-in-the-colonies\n\n\n\n>THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND POST-REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD \n\n>About the middle of the 18th century the common law of England began to take on a new meaning in America. The same colonists who had insisted that- certain English laws were inapplicable to their situation now began to appeal to the common law for protection against Parliament and\nthe Crown. The various settlements were feeling a new kinship one for another and it was acclaimed that all the American plantations, whether considered to be provincial, proprietary or charter colonies, were entitled to the common law of England. 28 \n\n*Citation [28]  One of the most critical legal problems of the times was the question of the maintenance of the royal prerogative in the American colonies. \n\n\nhttps://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4636&context=vlr\n\nConcern / application / legitimacy / reaction to : Somerset v Stewart, Intolerable Acts, Declaratory Act, etc.. all played a major role due to the core argument being intertwined.",

Led to underwhelming voter turn out on that end (i.e. Trump won).\n\nIt\u2019s almost like history repeats itself, or something\u2026\nThe \u201clesser of two evils\u201d argument always gets brought up, but I think a chunk of Americans are exhausted by this.\nThat said, that 2-3% just won\u2019t show up to vote anymore if neither candidate connects with them. Well, or they\u2019ll vote third-party.\n\n2028 will be the actual fork in the road for the US, not 2024. That\u2019ll have two non-incumbent candidates, likely JD as heir apparent & then a center-left Dem from a swing state.\n\nEuropeans are acting like the US literally can\u2019t 180 swap left in 2 years time, after mid-terms. Trump will have his way until the house and/or senate flips. It\u2019s just unfortunate that the left-leaning party in the US is very very incompetent.",

The French navy transported reinforcements, fought off a British fleet, and protected Washington\u2019s forces in Virginia.

He couldn\u2019t get rid of it, so he finally offered it to the US, and the US government took pity on him and decided to take it off his hands. I don\u2019t understand how the French government now thinks they have any right to it. Like, if my great granny from France gave her US family a gift, more than a hundred years ago, is the French government now coming after that too?",

It was basically him screaming \"Notice meeeeee!\"\n\nThe US answering it like they did is just silly : it's pretty much as if Lauren Boebert said that French should give back their oscars, and the french government answered that she should not care as she does not go in theaters to watch movies.\n\nSecondly, the statue was paid by French people, and the pedestal paid by US citizens. It's not a case of the US \"taking pity\" on some guy : it's a project that was worked on by both countries : they had to find the island and such _before_ building the statue. Tho it's true there is a debate about Bartholdi using previous ideas to finally make the statue.\n\n(fun facts: a copy of the _Declaration of Independence_ is in one of the stones of the pedestal, and the head of the statue is a copy of the [Great Seal of France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_France) )\n\nYou're right in saying it never belonged to the french government: it was a gift from _the french people_ to commemorate the Independence, delivered 10 years later because...french strikes (it's a joke, it was more a case of Franco-Prussian war that delayed the project)\n\nAnd we don't want it back, that's not what we do with gifts (\"giving is giving, taking back is stealing\" is an idiom everyone knows in France).\n\nChill out, you'll keep it on Liberty Island, unless you decide to replace it. What you do with gifts is up to you.\n\nMaybe the poem on the pedestal needs some adjustments tho, but this was not a french part",

Bartholdi was intent on designing a statue for Americans to commemorate their victory in the U.S. civil war, the abolition of slavery and 100 years as a country.
