Everyone still stockpiled these. The idea was always to create a standard to be applied to others, and live up to it yourself by default.\n\nIn practice, the (kinda fake) taboo on anti-infantry mines and (even moreso) cluster munitions really hurt Ukrainian defense. Russia's badly conceived battle plans in the initial invasion (remember the Belarus-Kiev convoy?) left Russia badly exposed to attacks from such weapons.\n\nThey were eventually supplied, and (remote deployed mines especially) played a big role in halting Russia's advance in the east and south. But Zaporizhia had already been lost. Russia had opportunity to deploy useful idiots and delay supply for months. Ukraine started with very little of what otherwise would have been a primary defensive munition.",

Because the Americans and British couldn\u2019t respond with their own types of rockets as they were too far behind with such technology, but they had existing WWI technology on chemical weapons and could have responded in kind.\n\nHow would NATO respond to Russia using landmines against them? Plant landmines in Alaska? It just doesn\u2019t make sense.",

NATO would have to start deployment 3-4 months before Russian troops arrive. Which isn't likely for many reasons.\n\n> Because in that case, and with the full might of the rest of the armies of the EU member states and the UK behind them\n\nExcept Baltics can't be easily supplied via land (Suwalki corridor will be *contested*), air (Russia has plenty long-range SAM to disrupt any air bridges), or sea (missiles again; though, I expect to see some naval drones now). Similar concerns apply to Finland as well (supply route via Tornio has its own problems).\n\nI.e. they won't actually have \"full might\" backing them. Support will be very limited.\n\n> I think they have a very good chance to stop them at the border. Even more so if the EU countries invest enough in cluster munitions with which they should strive to be able to saturate the whole Russian side of the frontline as soon as the Russians even try to set one foot across the border.\n\nSee above. It won't be Russian side of the frontline that will be saturated, as stopping Russian troops at the border is unrealistic. Baltics can't handle even 100k enemy troops, while Kremlin is capable of deploying at least 600k (as it does now in Ukraine).\n\nFrontline will be rolling westwards, and minefields will be created in that direction, on the territory of Baltics and Finland.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think you don't understand the painfully obvious.\n\nAs Baltics presented this idea in a joint statement, they discussed it beforehand. And the only place for them to jointly discuss military matters is NATO. It is also quite certain they also \"consulted\" NATO experts on topic of making major changes in their war doctrines and break treaties they've signed (Baltics don't really do independent international politics).\n\nHence, the whole thing with ap-mines was approved (if not mandated) by NATO.\n\nBut why would NATO implement war tactics that are primarily anti-civilian (would hurt long-term development of nation more than help war effort), and why do it now (but not in 2022, 2023, or 2024)?\n\nThe only major change is US pulling out of Europe. \n\nNote that without US, aforementioned problems with defence of Baltics (and Finland) are practically unsolvable. As EU part of NATO can't realistically defend them, it has to fall back to original (pre-2023) plans: retreat.\n\nAnd this is why ap-mines (use of which would be idiotic in any other circumstances) suddenly became viable: constant civilian deaths aren't a long-term problem, but a benefit if the place where they happen is Russia now.\n\nThat is the real context here. This isn't about some heroic last stand.",

Finland is vast enough that there are lots of fields for paratroopers to land in, and it's unfeasible to mine them all. Perhaps some coastal areas, but again coast is vast. The border is already off limits, no civilian is running there.\n\nAnd again, mines are only placed when war is imminent. Russians will very much be aware of the minefields ahead of them, they aren't ignorant. So obviously they will do their utmost to send unwanted people through first. Mining is not a peacetime activity. Sending refugees, real or otherwise, before waging a war is humanitarian crisis, but completely constructed one. Those refugees will not be there by their own choice, they are simply used by Russian military of intelligence services. Evil countries do evil things.\n\nRussians used roads in Winter war. They used roads at the start of war in Ukraine. That did not go well for Russians. But I am sure they will try that again though, true. Afterward they will adapt.\n\nIf you cannot distinguish between mines that are launched over the border towards cities and otherwise areas where civilians are that Russians launch as a weapon of terror. And mines placed between two frontlines, I don't know what to tell you. Or are you suggesting European militaries would focus on fighting their own civilian population by mining toys and whatnot?\n\nAnd yes. I am all for peace, I would not attack anyone. But if I am attacked - especially by nation that is known to commit war crimes against civilians such as myself, I would rather die fighting and surviving than be unarmed and tortured to death anyhow. Though more likely way for me to die is being terror bombed in a hospital, considering my profession.\n\nAnd if you cannot distinguish between trying to survive in a war that you did not start and starting the said war, there is no point discussing further.",

An unobserved minefield might cause a casualty or two and buy a few hours time at most. That is just not worth the cost and effort.\n\nMines also deteriorate once emplaced and their positions can shift over time with seasonal changes in the landscape. So a keeping a minefield permanent would be a permanent and dangerous problem. \n\nHOWEVER, there are about bazillion mines - of the more useful anti-tank varieties - in Finnish storage sites, and plans to emplace them in the period leading to war have been honed for decades. We even have special machines for emplacing anti-tank mines under paved roads, mines that can be placed on the side of the road, even mines that can be programmed to eg hit a random vehicle in a column or let the mine clearing roller pass but blow up the tank it\u2019s attached to.\n\nWe say Finland is a superpower in \u201ccounter mobility\u201d and mean it: if we have as much strategic warning as the Ukrainians had, practically every significant logistic route into Finland would be seeded with minefields all the way to Helsinki before the Russians cross the border.\n\nIn addition to filling and priming the prepared demolition charge pits the Finnish construction code mandates for bridges, tunnels, overpasses, rock cuts and similar features, and preparing (mined) barricades by strategically felling trees across the road, etc etc etc.",

And ultimately, the greatest risk and tragedy of mining areas is the (often decades of) post-war civilian casualties.

Backing out of such agreements can have serious repercussions.\n\nOn the other hand, how withdrawing from a treaty is seen by the remaining members of the treaty can vary wildly based upon the circumstances.  The current situation is one where keeping the option to use land mines open just makes sense for security purposes.  Using land mines defensively in your own country is entirely different than sowing them far in wide in someone else's country you're attacking -- the whole point of the treaty is to reduce the impact to civilians that leaving such fields in place has.  \n\nWith the way the winds are blowing, I don't think anyone's gonna give those countries any significant blowback for having withdrawn from the treaty.  This was a \"we're going to use official methods to withdraw from the treaty\" rather than just breaking it.  Most treaties have a similar out-clause.

Moving troops, change of a frontline, laziness to document. \n\nThere are so many reasons mines are not just a controlled element as many believe them to be. So deactivation might be a feature for some, the vast majority will still not have that and even with it, those modern ones have the same issues basically for at least  some time I listed.\n\nI do understand the arguments but also look historically at it. If any of it would actually be really needed, it will end like in many other countries that deal with loitering stuff decades afterwards. Pretty much every German can tell you some anecdotes about bombs needing removal and/or needed to be exploded in a controlled environment pretty much on a regular base.\n\nNow think mines that are a lot smaller. This stuff is hard to keep track of compared to a bomb with several kilos at a time.",

We will never know because shortly after climbing the second fence both were killed by landmines. The border guards of that section naturally heard the explosion and immediately went to check the sand to see who tried to escape to the west. Since the sand was undisturbed they came to the conclusion no escape attempt happened and it was possibly a deer stepping on it.\n\nThe two decomposed bodies were only found in April of 1963, 5 months after the incident, forcing to update the policy to check the fence even if it's not internal.\n\nThe issue is the Baltic states and Poland since their exit from the Warsaw pact have not had to fight in their own soil and never had to show if only military systems are Nato compatible or mindsets too. Exiting this treaty doesn't instill confidence in me they changed, rather it sends the message they don't trust the very Nato they're in.",

Seeing how barbaric the Russian army operates, that no longer is an option. That means a defensive line in the Baltics must be held, and that will require landmines. Lots of them.",
