Out of solidarity, but also because what is happening over there is impacting our research,\" said Berton.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, AMU, which has 120 research units and 80,000 students, welcomed the first of these potential recruits. Andrea, a 39-year-old doctor of epidemiology and assistant professor at a large state university in the American Northeast, does not wish to be identified. \"Because I have not yet had an official offer here, but also because I would like to personally announce my departure to the students and the postdoctoral fellow for whom I am responsible,\" she explained.\n\nOn a research mission in Africa, this infectious disease specialist came to Marseille without first returning to the US. \"It's all very sudden. The announcement was made on Wednesday, and I sent an email the next day. On Friday, I was asked to come... And here I am,\" she said.\n\n**Read the full article here:** [**https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2025/03/17/the-french-university-welcoming-american-researchers-targeted-by-trump-s-administration\\_6739235\\_10.html**](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2025/03/17/the-french-university-welcoming-american-researchers-targeted-by-trump-s-administration_6739235_10.html)",
