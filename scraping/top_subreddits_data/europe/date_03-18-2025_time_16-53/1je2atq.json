It is nothing we havent had so far, even Montenegro is in similar cooperation with Croatia and they have huge chunk of serb population. \nProbably they will buy some equipment from Croatia and send some personel to our schools and thats it.",

I thank the Minister of Albania and Croatia for this initiative, I appreciate that this agreement is the first trilateral in the region. Once again, this agreement is a Declaration, it is a message to every country that aims at destabilization, we are together and we expect other countries to join as well\", said the Macedonian.\n\nThis signed memorandum aims to promote cooperation in building defense capacities and the defense industry, increasing interoperability through education, training and exercises, countering hybrid threats and strengthening strategic resilience, providing full support for Euro-Atlantic and regional defense integration.\n\n**Kosovo, Albania and Croatia sign the Declaration of Military Alliance today**\n\nKosovo, Albania and Croatia will sign the Trilateral Declaration in Tirana on Tuesday with the aim of strengthening trilateral cooperation between the countries, while Bulgaria has also been invited to this alliance.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to military and strategic cooperation, this alliance also includes cooperation in the field of the defense industry, the Croatian media outlet \"Vecrenji List\" reported.\n\nThis declaration was signed by the Minister of Defense, Ejup Makedonci, and his counterparts from Albania, Pirro Vengu, and Croatia, Ivan Anusic.\n\nThis document includes cooperation in the field of defense, joint military operations and joint training.\n\nThis pact occurred due to geopolitical and security challenges in Southeast Europe, as well as external influences in the region.\n\nThe Croatian minister stressed that the goal is to strengthen regional stability and improve interoperability between the armed forces of the three countries, including joint exercises and exchange of military experiences.\n\n\"The three states will be prepared to face future security challenges in Southeast Europe, and there is a possibility that this trilateral military alliance will expand in the future with Bulgaria,\" the Croatian minister said.\u00a0\n\nLast week, Macedonian announced at a press conference that this event is the first of its kind in the Western Balkans region.\u00a0",
