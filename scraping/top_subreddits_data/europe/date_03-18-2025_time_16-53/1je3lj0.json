With Europe\u2019s demographics, your welfare state is on borrowed time no matter what you do.  It was only possible in the first place because you neglected so much of your defense spending.  Europeans will cling to their version of social democracy because you guys believe it makes you better than the US, but the reality is that it has knee capped your economies.  And as I said, with your demographics it is all going to come crashing down regardless.\n\nMy wife is a nanny and I only have a bachelor\u2019s degree but we make far more money than we would in Europe.  Life is comfortable here, even though Europeans desperately want to believe we live in some mad max dystopia in order to justify their own actions with high taxes and regulations. It is quite sad honestly.  A continent fading in relevancy desperately clinging onto a model which cannot last.  European ego\u2019s will not recover when they realize their economic model was not superior to America and that their expansive welfare states came at a very high cost.  Oh well, not our problem.",

Your countries are almost entirely preoccupied with welfare and regulations.  You\u2019ve gotten to the point where increasing taxes actually results in less revenue overall because people just up and leave.  European style social democracy was fine for a few decades, but it was never a sustainable system.  It incentivized a lot of self defeating behavior.  Inequality isn\u2019t a problem, and I haven\u2019t been able to find one person who can give me a concrete example for how it negatively affects me.  I see jealousy as the prime motivation for complaining about inequality, not an actual concern for the state of the nation.  The US was a lot more unequal than the USSR, but that in no way means the USSR was a better place to  live.  Actual economic metrics and not vague feelings about stability clearly show we picked the model which maximizes economic output.  Maximizing economic\nOutput is thinking about long term prosperity.  Thinking about redistribution as primary is focusing on short term feel good policies which are quite bad in the long term. \n\nWe will see which model ultimately wins out, but for the EU to win we would have to see an inversion of economic trends which I frankly don\u2019t see happening. Your demographics are bad, your welfare is bloated, your taxes are sky high, and your population will refuse to reform welfare because it feels entitled to it.  It is basically like you guys tore the steering wheel off of a massive ship.  Sure, the ship will still go in a straight line for a while and stay afloat, but it can\u2019t react dynamically anymore, so it is only a matter of time until it hits something and sinks.  How are you going to pay for welfare with a 1 to 1 ratio of workers and welfare recipients?  The basic math just does not work",

Just because a single author said something doesn\u2019t mean it is the thinking of the nation.

They don\u2019t want that, because about all they know regarding economics is that they want more from the government.  The economic knowledge on Reddit is almost non existent, so people pull that quote out to justify their own positions, when in reality it has almost no bearing on the discussion.  \n\nThe simple fact is, a lot of us who aren\u2019t rich and will never be rich still prefer our model because it provides more prosperity to more people.  The numbers clearly show that.  Now, if you want to reorient your society towards the bottom 20 percent through redistribution, that is your prerogative,  but it comes with a lot of costs.  Instead of honestly assessing those costs and long term implications, people like you would rather pretend the system you like only has upsides and it is poor ignorants who think they will be millionaires who uphold the system you don\u2019t like.

The main reform he pushed when he was elected was the flat tax, meaning that all revenues from capital and investment are capped at 30%. You can also choose to have an income tax is the rate would be lower than 30%. \n\nIn the meantime, our income tax is progressive, ranging from 0% to 45% depending of your revenues. The 30% rate applies for revenues between 29.316\u20ac to 83.823\u20ac per year (that's 2443\u20ac to 6985\u20ac per month), which is already high salaries but not that high (The median income in France in 2024 is of 2231\u20ac). That means that as of today in France, capital income is less taxed than work income, which is the contrary to any policies aimed to promote work. \n\nOn that, you have to add multiple pro business policies aimed at promoting work that ended up boosting up share revenues of shareholders rather than increasing salaries or creating jobs. French companies benefit massively from a special tax reduction aimed to boost research (\"L'imp\u00f4t cr\u00e9dit recherche\") costing 7.7 billions euros per year to the French State. This mechanism is well known to be abused by companies, listing fake projects in order to benefit from it without any control from the State. Macron also reduced the tax on companies profit from 33% to 25%. \n\nIn the meantime, the main political message in France since his election is that we are in massive debt, that we don't have the means to be as generous as we used to be, and we must cut in all social program, from retirement pension to unemployment benefits and programs aimed at preventing people to fall into extreme poverty. \n\nThe retirement pension reform is an example of the issue : The main reason French people are against it is not because we collectively refuse to work longer. I, for example, have an office job, and I have no problem working up to 65 or 67 years old. The main issue is that it was imposed from the top without any nuances or whatever on the actual jobs people do. I can work up to 67 in an office job. But someone who have been a mason, or a teacher in primary school? What for people who started to work early? At first, the reform also had no provision for women who had to stop working to raise children because there were no other solutions for the couple at that time (there is some now, but it is still limited).",

No debate on increasing the contributions to fund the retirement system (which would have balanced the burden of the debt proportionaly on revenues rather than having it relies heavily on the poorest as what is done with the age ajustment) or to reduce pensions currently given to people in retirement (who will receive more from pension that what they contributed to when they were working).\n\nI do understand the idea that by reducing costs on investments, you attract them which boost your economic activity and then increase revenus in your country. I get it. But what these policies contributed to do was to allow the richest to become even richer. Between 2017 and 2023, the cumulative wealth of the 500 highest fortunes in France when from 571 billions euros to 1.170 billions euros. In the meantime, poverty rates went from 13.8% in 2017 to 14.4% in 2022 (not a big increase, but yet an increase).\n\nTrickle down economy only work if there are incentives for wealthy people to reinject money in the economy, either through investment or through consumption. But having such important wealth doesn't allow for consumption (a rich person is still a person, there is a limit of what he can consume on a daily basis) and for investment, there are lots of financial investments who have no impact on the real economy in which they place their wealth. So without some form of mechanisms aiming at redistributing a part of the wealth or force it to be reinjected in the economy, all the cuts you give will only boost profits without any returns. And in the end, you drain your economy of money, which cause a global slow down and recession.",

The wealthy, as the nobles of ancient times, organize weedings between them in order to secure alliances and consolidate their wealth. This allows them to keep their money, and transmit it to their children. Say children already start in life with the highest education available, as well as all the network and connections. When they reach adulthood, they are hired in high paying position in their families companies, and then inherits the shares. \n\nThis create a system allowing concentration of wealth in a limited number of individuals (which is not good for an healthy economy), increase inequalities further more and give them huge political influence on how countries are managed. This is dangerous as an economy can't work with high concentration of wealth : it drains the system of the needed money for it to work properly (to simplify : Less money shared between the general population means less consumption/investment, which means less activity/revenues for companies).\n\nA normal, functionning capitalist system have to include high inheritance taxes aiming at funding educational system (and other such as healthcare) to enable economical dynamism.",

I can't pay for the loan alone (our house cost 2M which sounds like a lot but is very average here in Luxembourg if you want to have enough space for children and a garden), so my wife has to work. Would the society prefer that she stops working? This would remove a high skilled female software developer from the economy. I don't understands why the society sees us as bogeyman and wants to tax us more, we pay already more than a third of our salaries to taxes (probably half when you consider that everything you buy is taxed again) while billionaires are able to pay barely any taxes. All we want is to do hard work to finance a house for our children and later pay for their further education. I don't see how we are somehow the problem.",

We did not have a lifestyle of the wealthy. The point was to do with the discrepancy between high earnings not necessarily equating to good financial health because most people who are actually rich earn money through other means - usually parental or investments.\n\nFor example, we earned a good joint salary at that time but we also jointly spent \u00a31,000 per month commuting. We had no support for childcare so we had to pay over \u00a31,500 a month for part time childcare. We had no support for housing or support from family to get a house and the mortgage we were on cost \u00a31,500 a month. Thats \u00a34,000 on housing, commuting, and childcare all of which were essential. Renting rather than having a mortgage would have been equally expensive. That is before you take off any pension contributions, student finance, utilities, or food.

The reason we have decided to organize our societies into liberal democracies, is because we realized that in order to have a safe and prosperous society, we need to have a stable society. Where certain rules are respected and investment and business can flourish.\n\nHow can you make sure a society is stable? By decentralizing power and resources in your society. Nobody should have too much and everybody should have the opportunity to have something.\n\nThe mistake the communists made was to conflate the state with the people. The communists believed that if the state owns everything, it means the people own it too. Which of course is not true. The state owning something does not mean a citizen owns it, thus a communist society is one where all the resources and power is concentrated in the state, resulting in an unstable and poor society. So your statement that the soviet union was equal is false. The soviet union was highly unequal, because a few people (the state and the communist party) had everything, while the rest had next to nothing.\n\nOligarchy is the problematic situation in which a few private citizens have too many resources, leaving almost nothing to the rest, which again, distorts competition and stability in a society.\u00a0\n\nSo in a society, in order for it to be stable and flexible (and thus business friendly), power and resources need to be spread out between the state, corporations, and private citizens. Where exactly that limit is, I am not sure. Nobody can be sure.\u00a0\n\nYes, the US has had some great innovations coming out of their society. But then again, so has Europe. And so has the US when the taxes were a lot higher than they are now. So it is not as simple as saying that because Facebook and Amazon came out, the system is great in America.\u00a0How many people need to work multiple jobs in order not to starve themselves? That is another metric that one can look at, and certainly differs between America and the average European country. Point is, it is not that simple. And lower taxes are not always the solution to a great economy and society.",

The Soviet Union did not, under any circumstances, have more inequality than the US.  The US saw a vast range of inequality compared to a mostly equal Soviet system, even if the politburo had special privileges.  It is the same type of argumentation too, that funds being distributed creates a healthier economy.  Why would that be the case?  I make far more than I would in Europe, so I simply do not care if a lot of billionaires exist.  Billionaires tend to chance ROI, which means they are investing in future growth.  Welfare spending usually gets used to buy the basics, which means there is no growth attached to it, just consumption.  The only worse thing you could do for ROI would be to light the money on fire.  Keeping it in the economy through welfare is marginally better than burning it, but it still has no ROI.  \n\nIn concrete terms, why should I care the US is more unequal than Europe?  We are more wealthy and make more money for the same jobs with more disposable\nIncome.  That is a real thing I care about, not some vague argument about inequality which could have been used equally for the USSR.\n\nI get the feeling people who use your arguments just assume there will always be a healthy economy to extract taxes from. You don\u2019t have to worry about business being competitive, competitive businesses will just exist no matter how you tax or regulate them.  That might have been true decades ago when it was basically Europe and the US driving the global economy, but things have changed.  Europe keeps slipping further and further behind, missing out on key new industries almost entirely. Your economy is not always going to be able to handle the exorbitant demands you place on it.  You guys are already seeing basically no growth since 2008 compared to the US, and the French president as well as the labour minister in Britain have both said your social democracy isn\u2019t sustainable.  Too many people on benefits, taxes too high, and regulation too expansive. Look at your big companies, they are almost all really old companies. That is not a good sign at all, it means you are trying to squeeze every last drop from successful companies while new companies can\u2019t get a foothold.  \n\nI feel as if I won\u2019t change your mind, some people truly believe European social democracy is the pinnacle of societal organization, but I don\u2019t think it matters either way.  Your system won\u2019t be able to continue as it is. Your demographics don\u2019t support it and with increased military spending you will have to make hard choices.  The simple fact is, your economy isn\u2019t strong enough nor has it grown enough to support the things you want it to.  You can\u2019t ignore the economic realities.  Look Spain, soon they will have more retirees than workers.  How is welfare supposed to work then?  Never mind trying to create an environment that grows business. If you guys don\u2019t make the necessary cuts and deregulatory decisions, the market will do it for you.",

He is not above using Trump-like post truth rethorics and gaslighting at times to have it his way (many compare him to a \"toxic ex\"). He also has a very autocratic, caesarist, or bonapartist conception of political power - him alone as representative of a people too immature to rule themselves. Come on, guy straight up compared himself to Jupiter the King of the Gods!\n\nJust a simple red flag for me: guy named his party - En Marche ! - after his initials in 2017.\n\nMacron is a megalomaniac who wants to rule alone and be sucked up to. Add to that endemic high-level corruption, severe cases of fully supported police violence, abuse of antiterrorist legislation to target grassroot opponents (like ecologists), skyrocketing inequalities with severe neglect and comtemp of public services and their civil servants (education and healthcare above all), concentration of media in the hands of a few billionaires and tighter control over public media, far-right pandering with outright anti-rule-of-law ministers (Retailleau), disredard of election results... And to top it off he is unsufferably arrogant. That's not accidental he ended up on the banner of r/ABoringDystopia.\n\nHe is far less worse, ie stupid or deluded, than Trump, but he would be a very, VERY sorry excuse for a leader of a *free* world. He absolutely lives for that label, loving the prestige it brings him, and he does everything he can to always appear like he's got the moral high-ground. But that's exactly what makes him a touchy free world leader (does it even needs a leader?). Be very careful of that guy...\n\nThat said, his international policy is THE point most people are actually ok with - and it IS a crucial point. But on a domestic level, the guy is quite hated. And I truly mean hated. 44% \"very dissatisfied\" in january IFOP survey, with 79% \"dissatisfied\" in total, by a large amount of people who are not as well off as his electorate (polling and post-electoral studies show his only consistent electoral base is wealthy people, especially retirees). We sure French aren't gentle to our leaders by a long shot, but even that cultural bias has its limits.\n\nWhat I mean is that you should offer very circumstancial support to that man.\n\nEdit : IFOP survey results",

I'm assuming you're not a billionaire, so you must be completely brainwashed by them to be defending them.\n\nMost of the money they don't make by running businesses at all, it's money that they make off other people's work, and interest on their existing assets.

Some in-demand assets like real estate will also fall back into the retail market, easing the pressure allowing actual homeowners to buy.",

High taxes on wealth and income can disincentivize entrepreneurship, as successful individuals may feel penalized for their hard work and risk-taking. Moreover, while a basic safety net is necessary, excessive welfare can create dependency and reduce incentives to work and innovate. True economic mobility comes from expanding opportunities, fostering free markets, and reducing regulatory barriers\u2014not from over-taxation and wealth redistribution, which can ultimately weaken the economy and drive talent and capital elsewhere.",

I agree that welfare and taxation can go too far.\u00a0\nBut the idea that the economy will just boom if you just cut taxes is moronic, especially when we can see the effect of those policies for the past decades.\n\nYou need both, effective taxation of the people who hold too much, social security nets, and incentives for business. But usually when someone mentions taxing the rich they reflexively say that this will kill business. No, it depends on the situation. Raising taxes on billionares and people with hundreds of millions will most likely not stifle the economy, but on the contrary, will put more money into action.\u00a0\n\nAnd no, market competition is not the best way to tackle monopolies. That is why we have antimonopoly laws and heavily regulate M&A activity. In the US as well (EU M&A laws are basically copies of the US ones).",

Poor people don't have that luxury.\n\n>Some people have high IQ.\n\nDonald Trump is exhibit A for how wealth and intelligence are not at all related.\n\nThe obscene wealth a few people hoard isn't just wasteful, it is active control in the economy. The economy by and large is a big mess of dictatorships, some competing some symbiotic.\n\nOne thing we as a species should have learned by now is that dictatorships make bad decisions. We need to democratize the economy and that means no one person can control an entire corporation against the interests of everybody else. All stakeholders need a say in how the economy is run",
