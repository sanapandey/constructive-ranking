The missile this is about is similar to Kinzhal though, so a glorified ballistic missile. The US has plenty of other legit programs and I have no doubt they will materialize. The issue is just that they took interest in such tech way later than Russia and China.\n\nFrance itself was ahead in the race in the 1990s and early 2000s (and was also unfortunately cooperating with..... erhm... Russia on the matter in the early 2000s) but did not go all in on actual armament programs for unknown reasons until Russia began testing its weapons in the second half of the 2010s.\n\nIt is actually crazy how far back France's [interest in this field goes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_weapon). A hypersonic glide vehicle program in 1965 is hilarious... and went as expected lmao. We used to be mad lads. Where are these crazy ambitions nowadays, man? We were throwing money at all kinds of crazy stuff back in the day to see what it sticks.",

But France successfully tested its [VMaX](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14r6i5w/france_debuts_hypersonic_glide_weapon_in_first/) hypersonic glide vehicle in 2023. A second one, VMaX-2, is scheduled to be tested this year.\n\nAlso the upcoming ASN4G Macron is referencing in the post is a hypersonic cruise missile. The only hypersonic cruise missile allegedly in service right now is Russia's Zircon but it is not an air-launched (it arms ships and submarines only IIRC).",

The Sherman was obviously shitty compared to the Panther yet it won the war\n- Countries can lose know how over the span of generation. Canada did some pretty nice designs alone after WWII and now they're unable to make their own designs. It's a political matter: governments decide to either fund research or not (then the providing country repays itself through dependency etc). China was a backward country 40 years ago now they build so called 6th gen aircraft",
