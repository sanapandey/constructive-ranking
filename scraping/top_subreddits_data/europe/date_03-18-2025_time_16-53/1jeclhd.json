They said it's actually EASIER to diagnose someone like Trump, who is in front of cameras and very active on social media, and presenting himself in his natural state. Versus when they have a patient in their office answering their questions, and the patient will often lie, exaggerate, or downplay a lot of things. You're not \"yourself\" when you're sitting in a psychologist's office, at least not the first couple times you meet, if ever. But Trump's mental disorder is blatantly obvious to trained professionals.",

A progressive intellectual who, in the 1970s, married a woman from a Soviet-aligned country. He partied with black people and Jewish people, despite being a man of absurd wealth and stature at a time when that was *not* the norm. He ran the numbers and made his father far wealthier than he otherwise would have been.\n\nPeople talk about his bankruptcies as if they prove failure. In reality, with his level of wealth, not having bankruptcies would be unusual. If he can buy a casino with a 10% chance of earning millions in perpetuity for just $10,000, why wouldn\u2019t he? If he buys 20 for $200,000, even if 90% fail and he files for bankruptcy *on those businesses*, the 10% that succeed could make him millions. People don\u2019t understand how business and risk stratification work.\n\nAnd the felony? He wrote that his payment to his lawyer was a legal fee. A lawyer argued it was misleading\u2014that, based on Christian values, he wanted to hide his sex life. Somehow, they won. That turned every single check or note into a felony\u201434 in total. Absurd.\n\nTrump is a nerd. He\u2019s awkward. He has a weird personality. But he\u2019s incredibly intelligent. So is Musk. Maybe just take a closer look.",

Ideally, this leads to several key outcomes:\n\n\n1. Wealthy consumers absorb more taxation. Luxury imports, like a $22,000 bottle of wine, will face tariffs. The wealthy, who can afford them, won\u2019t care. This means they take on more of the tax burden.\n\n2. Middle-class income taxes could be eliminated. If those earning under $150,000 no longer pay income tax, prices may rise\u2026 but would you rather pay 10% more for groceries or 10% of your income?\n\n3. Corporations will be forced to use legal U.S. labor. Companies like Walmart currently chase the cheapest labor overseas, often relying on unethical practices\u2026 child labor, forced labor, who knows? Under this system, they\u2019ll be penalized for outsourcing and incentivized to employ American workers under U.S. labor laws.\n\n4. American manufacturing will surge. Taiwan is investing $100 billion in U.S. infrastructure. Apple is moving production from China. Tesla is already all-in on American manufacturing. Canada will no longer supply cars to the U.S. unless it joins as a state. These policies will drive up domestic wealth and reinforce American economic strength.\n\n\nAnd of course, the US will keep its allies close. Hungary, Ireland, leaders who have stood by the US in the transitional phase? They will NOT be forgotten. We have been floating Canada for some time. Loyalty and compassion are rewarded.",
