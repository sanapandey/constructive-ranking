I had to do this on a door to my kitchen  too narrow for the gap you might be able to stack it\n\nOr better yet stick a stip on the door  frame and on the top of the door\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBLZ3PF7?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_4&th=1",

You just need some finish grade lumber and some good measuring and cutting skills so it fits properly. Then paint to match. Carpentry just takes time and patience to get it right. Or hire it out to a good finish carpenter who has experience. Like some Amish guy who builds custom furniture could do it in an hour. Call around and find a qualified craftsman rather than a do it all handyman.",
