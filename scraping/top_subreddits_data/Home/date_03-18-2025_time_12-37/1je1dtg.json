Maybe some over counter type filler, cement, adhesive to use for these ? \n\nSeems the filler or material behind has crumbled over time \n\n",

I\u2019m just conscious that the remaining good tiles have the cement backing, so if I just use adhesive alone it may be too flat compared to the other ones that are still good? Or am I overthinking it ?",

Also make sure the temperature outside is correct (read the glues label). If there is debris in the way the glue will stick to that instead of the actual surface you want it to. That might even be the case what happened here (and it doesn\u2019t look like enough glue)",
