    "selftext": "We had a really rough hail last week here in NC and sadly it turned whole 3 exterior walls of my house into Swiss cheese. I just got this house a couple months ago and paying mortgage on it. My insurance premium is currently about $1000/year, $2500 deductible. I filed a claim with the insurance for the damage but just now realized that it\u2019s probably gonna make my premium skyrocket. Has anyone had experience with claims like that without it making your premium go up? Or I made a mistake filing a claim? \nThe other question is that would it still raise my premium potentially if I choose to not go through with the claim?\nThank you in advance! ",
