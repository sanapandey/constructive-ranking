Had some pressure issues so had an independent person investigate and they thought it hadn't been serviced in years!\n\nOff of his recommendation we get a new boiler installed (separate company) who showed me the flue... Is this servicing neglect or at least, should have been flagged? I'm not sure how long this would take to erode.\n\nFeels like a lot of corrosion if the last \"service\" was only 10 months ago",

While it looks bad, it\u2019s not as bad as you might think. They are designed in such a way as to minimise the risk of combustion gases entering the building. I\u2019d check that the flue inside isn\u2019t damaged so as to be leaking acidic condensate into the air duct, but the corrosion could be due to contact with a damp wall, being cemented in (cement is very corrosive) or something like that. You should have flue gas analysis printouts from your services that would have failed if there was excessive CO readings. And this probably wouldn\u2019t be picked up at service without dismantling the flue (you can\u2019t expect your engineer to deconstruct the whole boiler. If there are dangerous issues with the combustion they will make themselves apparent in the flue gas analysis). I think you\u2019d struggle to claim compensation for this.",

They have to pay to participate. So they accept the job for a pre determined amount paid to them by the service that they don't think is enough. They show up with this attitude and end up complaining to you to try and get more money directly from you. They are millenials with little experience and inadequate tools, (one had to borrow my extension cord, flashlight, other basics everyone should have) and they also complain about how hot it is outside and how the work is so hard and they aren't making any money, etc. I had one say he had to leave for parts and never came back except for sneaking back to get his tools (forgot some haha) before abandoning the job altogether without a word! Sent a scathing email to the referral service threatening to turn them in to the State Attorney General and got credit for a redo, unfortunately it was more whiny millennials again with no experience who also had an aversion to hard work, did a lazy shitty incomplete job, slopped paint everywhere after I asked them to use the drop cloths I provided, and did not like following my instructions because they wanted to do it their way that they felt the universe wanted them to do that they thought was way better. This time I got a refund. \n\nAt least try to get your money back and never use these scam referral services again. Word of mouth is the only way to go, really. Go on sites like Nextdoor and post what services you need and get genuine local referrals from neighbors. I found a great HVAC guy (one of the good millennials, haha) who I have used more than once this way. Good luck!\n\nNo offense to millenials.
