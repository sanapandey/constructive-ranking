    "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m in the process of buying my first home. She\u2019s almost 100 years old but I\u2019m in love. Yes, yes, I\u2019ve received warnings about buying an old home but it\u2019s always been a dream of mine. I\u2019m okay with work needing to be put in\u2026 within reason. It needs some cosmetic work, which I\u2019m onboard with, but I\u2019m concerned about structure. I\u2019m waiting on an inspection and the suspense is killing me! Could cracks in the ceiling mean major structural damage? Plaster cracking from settling for almost a century? Are these questions pointless to ask until the inspection? \ud83d\ude02 It was inspected a little over a year ago and got approved for an FHA loan. ",

            "body": "It is hard to tell for sure from your photos, but the cracked ceiling near the fireplace could be due to external chimney flashing that needs repair. Anything that has flashing, including the \"boots\" that cover pipe vents on the roof, need to be checked and periodically resealed. Depending on how long this has been going on, it could need additional repair on this inside thanks to wet/not-drying rafters, joists, plaster, etc. The house looks really lovely. Note that any older house will need some level of repair due to missed maintenance. Nothing in your photos looks like major structural damage, but an inspector should be able to suss it out for you. If it was approved for an FHA loan a year ago, then whatever is showing up now is likely due to recently overlooked maintenance. FHA is very picky about approving homes for loans. Make sure you have a really good inspector; it makes a difference. Go through the house with them, ask questions during the inspection. Looks like a terrific home. Good luck!",
