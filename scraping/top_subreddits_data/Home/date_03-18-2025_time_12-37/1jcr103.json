    "selftext": "Hi. We just bought a house recently (<6 mo.) and found this while replacing the caulk. I noticed some pink mold on the top of the caulking so I'm stripping it all. I'm guessing that the plastic allowed humidity to condense on the back side of the plastic without being allowed to vent, since it is more or less hermetically sealed. Caulk around everywhere in the shower. \n\nSince there is both pink and a dark mold on the back of the caulking, does this mean that it is likely all behind the plastic shower? Does this warrant a complete tear out? Or is this normal?",

Usually. \n\nYou'll need the fan unit, a drywall saw, studfinder, ducting, a hole saw for getting from the attic to the outside, and don't forget to accurately measure your hight on the outside siding or drill a small pilot hole and stick something through from the outside as a reference once you're in the attic.\n\nHow hard it'll be depends on whether you have attic access to the ceiling above, and if you understand how to walk on the ceiling joists so you don't fall through the damn drywall ceiling and bust the absolute piss put of your nuts on one.  Ask me how I know. \ud83d\ude05\n\nYou'll also have to run independent power from the switch to the unit, unless there's already a light in your ceiling, and you're good with either swapping the fan unit to where the light is, or having them come on together.  Then you can just run a section of the appropriatepower cable between them.  Exhaust fan with the shower light on the same switch is a popular option.\n\nIt's definitely doable but you need to put some time into researching not only how to do the whole process, but code requirements, and whether you'll need a permit in your area.  Some places are worse than others. \nAlso, be really fucking careful with electrical and look up what you're doing, or hire a professional to make the terminations.\n\nEdit: Not making an intelligence or capability judgement on you, but I really feel like I'm morally and professionally obligated to warn you that doing any of this yourself could be hazardous and/or violate your homeowner's insurance/mortgage insurance, so really make sure you're allowed to by law and also comfortable enough with it before you DIY anything with electrical.\n\nSincerely  -  residential electrician who's done a few.",

I have an exhaust fan in the bathroom, but it's small, not powerful enough to remove the humidity.  The ductwork for the exhaust fan is too small to install a larger fan and the ductwork does not vent to the outside. \n\nI need to hire a professional to correct this situation.  I think I need an hvac person to put in the larger duct, but who (type of professional) do I hire to cut the hole to vent the exhaust fan to the outside; is that also the hvac person?  I think I may need a larger hole in my bathroom ceiling to accommodate a larger fan; would the hvac person also do that?  Can you offer any advice on how to get this done..........thank you",

You might need to use a stainless steel scrubber pad OR a \"red\" ScotchBrite pad to remove all the crud.  We have a plastic tub, and the stainless scrubber pad doesn't harm the surface if you don't go overboard with pressure.  \nClean up the mold...here's how:  [https://www.epa.gov/mold/what-are-basic-mold-cleanup-steps](https://www.epa.gov/mold/what-are-basic-mold-cleanup-steps)  \nLet the whole mess dry and air out for a couple days.  Perhaps bring a portable fan into the bathroom, pointed into the enclosure, to ensure good airflow and thorough drying.\n\nNow the fun part...how to PROPERLY install caulk.  This technique does a nearly perfect job of caulking with straight lines, deeply embedded caulk, and an excellent seal.  \nVery simple:  lay down painter's masking tape on either side of the crevice.  In the case of your tub/shower, place the tape about 1/4\" to 3/8\" on either side of the crevice.  Make sure the tape adheres to the surface well.  \nAdd caulk more sparingly than you might expect.  Wearing a nitrile glove, or with a wet fingertip, press the caulk hard into the crevice; draw out the caulk with your finger to the point where you can see the edge of the tape; smooth it well.  Remove the tape carefully while the caulk is wet.  Have a large trash bag on hand to collect the messy tape.  Stand back and admire your work.  Let the caulk dry according to the directions on the caulking tube.    \nPerfect caulking job with no ugly spread into the tub/shower pan and up the wall.  AND THE CAULK IS PRESSED FIRMLY INTO THE CREVICE FOR AN EXCELLENT SEAL.",

From there the drywall will absorb it, rot the plywood and eventually leak to the ceiling below. If it\u2019s on a slab, the drywall absorb the water, but eventually the studs will mold. The only type tub you don\u2019t need to caulk is a sterling brand with a wall surround for that brand tub. There might be some other brands that have a similar drain design built in.\nThen I stand corrected but from what I see from the pictures you definitely need to caulk it.",
