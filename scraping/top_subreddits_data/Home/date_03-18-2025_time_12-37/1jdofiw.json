Every day I have to use a mop to absorb the water and drain it in the bucket but don't know what's causing this. It also doesn't help that the sum pump is right next to but none of the water goes into it because of the way that the basement was built",

There is a small water line that goes into the top of the box and disperses water down an internal medium (looks like a filter).  The air that blows in from the flue pipe passes through the medium and mixes with the water to add humidity to the air going through the hood of the furnace.  Generally there is a 24v powered valve that gets the signal to allow water to flow in the line when the furnace starts up.   There can be a lot of water that is not mixed with the air and passes down to the bottom of the medium and ends up draining to a sump etc.  The drain lines can pick up a lot of slime over time and can plug up.  In the summer there is a similar condensate drain at the pan below the AC coils in the hood which also can get plugged up.  This is the best I can describe it.",
