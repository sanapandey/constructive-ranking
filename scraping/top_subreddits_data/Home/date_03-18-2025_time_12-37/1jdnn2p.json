Generally 2,000 to 4,000 lbs per square foot, compared to concrete compressive strength of (usually) 4,000 lbs per square inch.  The purpose of the concrete is to distribute the weight over a greater area of ground.\n\nThere is a point where you could overload the material supporting the concrete, compressing it and causing the concrete above to crack.  If the ground near the garage wall wasn't properly compacted, the floor will crack sooner if overloaded, but would be likely to crack regardless.\n\nIt looks like you have roughly 4 ft. of pavers there.  Pavers are roughly 150 lbs per cubic ft.  4 feet is 600 pounds per square foot.  Well below typical soild bearing strength or concrete compressive strength.",
