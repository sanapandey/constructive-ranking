Granite countertop guys are really good at mixing epoxy fillers to match colors.\n\nBetter way: remove cracked tiles, remove enough substrate to fit an isolation mat without making a trip hazard, then put new tiles on top.\n\nBest way: demo the cracked concrete beneath, or at least enough to ensure you have a stable foundation, pour new concrete with more rebar, retile (over an isolation mat).\n\nYour decision will be helped by knowing how fast that crack is growing and how much money you want to throw at it.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lvEM9VkfE4A](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lvEM9VkfE4A)",
