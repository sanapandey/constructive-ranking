I don't know why it works. I just know it does.",

I would avoid attaching it from the bottom because if it sticks out you t scratch up something you\u2019re sweeping.   From the side or at angle.   Be careful not to be too close to an edge or the wood can crack.  \n\nWood glue is easier but be prepared to redo it from time to time.   Prep the surface as per wood glue instructions.",
