He claims he was ready to record at any time and the studio had not reached out to him.\n\nLast Wednesday, everyone found out that the voice actors for Lycaon and Solider 11 got replaced. Nicholas claimed he didn\u2019t know about this and tried to paint the studio in a bad light.\n\nThe plot twist is that Solider 11\u2019s old VA put out a statement where she simply explained she had been choosing to strike from the role (in the fight against AI) and had no grudge about being replaced. It turns out Nicholas had also been voluntarily striking, but instead of doing it silently, he had tried to paint false narratives and act as if the studio was at fault.\n\nAlso the studio, Sound Cadence, is ran by super popular voice actors in the anime/game community so Nicholas looks even worse.\n\nAnd the reason why Sound Cadence isn\u2019t simply agreeing to the strike\u2019s interim agreement is because SAG-AFTRA is trying to use the strike as a powerplay. If a studio agrees to their deal, it means every voice actor on the project will have to join SAG-AFTRA, therefore paying $3000 and other annual fees.\n\n**TL;DR:** Actor claims he was removed from project for no reason and blames studio. It turns out he had chosen to strike and blamed studio anyway.",

And the best part about this, is that he is not a member of the SAG-AFTRA Union - he joined the Strike out of his own volition, which of course means that he was not protected by it.\n\nOn top of that, this was arguably so far his biggest role as a Voice Actor - and he ended it by trying to create a false narrative towards his employer for no reason. Thurkettle basically destroyed any trust that he had with Studio Cadence just to get some internet points - and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he struggles to find a new job in the industry in general due to this as well...",
