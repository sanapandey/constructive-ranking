You'll just have to overlook the mediocre writing and a narrative that lacks pacing.\n\n[**But Why Tho?**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-) \\- [Jason Flatt](https://opencritic.com/critic/6622/jason-flatt) \\- [6 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft/)\n\n>It\u2019s a well-crafted game within its own scale with a great story and emotionally resonant characters, but in the grand scheme of what a big open-world RPG could provide, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows doesn\u2019t maximize its potential.\n\n[**Cerealkillerz**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz) \\- [Nick Erlenhof](https://opencritic.com/critic/8745/nick-erlenhof) \\- *German* \\- [8.5 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-assassins-creed-shadows-samurai-ehre-trifft-gekonnt-auf-shinobi-stealth/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is the best installment in the series for a long time and brings many fresh ideas to the table. The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\n\n[**Console Creatures**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures) \\- [Court LaLonde](https://opencritic.com/critic/10476/court-lalonde) \\- [8 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an unexpected amount of player agency against the Feudal Japan backdrop fans of the series have wanted for ages.\n\n[**Console-Tribe**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe) \\- [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) \\- *Italian* \\- [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/assassins-creed-shadows-307262/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is the culmination of years of evolution in the saga, blending refined action/RPG gameplay with one of the series' most captivating settings. The contrast between Naoe and Yasuke offers distinct playstyles, encouraging variety and experimentation. Stealth mechanics are more polished than ever, while combat, though not as deep as a pure action game, remains fun and well-balanced.\n\n[**Dexerto**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto) \\- [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) \\- [4 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-the-best-since-black-flag-3164004/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed has been fighting to find its identity for over a decade, and thanks to Shadows it's finally rediscovered it. Sure, its combat can be clunky and some story beats felt oddly placed (particularly Yasuke's backstory), but Shadows is exactly what Assassin's Creed needed to prove it still has a beating heart. Whether you\u2019re looking to explore the stunning world of feudal Japan, storm the gates of an enemy castle, or fall in love with the many NPCs that populate its world, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive treat that cements itself as the best Assassin's Creed game since Black Flag.\n\n[**Digitale Anime**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime) \\- [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) \\- *Arabic* \\- [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/63927)\n\n>\"A worthy heir to a venerable lineage\" Assassin's Creed Shadows offers one of the most distinctive stealth and infiltration experiences in the series, thanks to its dual-hero system and richly detailed world. Improved AI, environmental interaction, and the impact of seasons on gameplay make it an immersive experience for fans of stealth and tactical combat. Despite some flaws, Ubisoft Quebec has succeeded in delivering a well-rounded experience that combines the series' authenticity with its innovations.\n\n[**Digitec Magazine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine) \\- [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) \\- *German* \\- [3 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/37187)\n\n>The real star of \u201cAssassin's Creed: Shadows\u201d is the visually stunning game world. It impresses with its many details, beautiful weather effects and changing seasons. It is perhaps the most beautiful open game world I have ever experienced. Unfortunately, this spectacular backdrop offers little substance despite the solid gameplay basis. Repetitive missions, boring side activities and a half-baked story leave me unsatisfied overall.\n\n[**Enternity.gr**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/783/enternity-gr) \\- [Giannis Archontidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/8646/giannis-archontidis) \\- *Greek* \\- [8.5 / 10](https://www.enternity.gr/Article/Games/Reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/93784.html)\n\n>Whether you're a fan of the gorgeous old Assassin's Creed, the new open world, or just joining the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows should not be missing from any library!\n\n[**Entertainment Geekly**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/874/entertainment-geekly) \\- [Luis Alvaro](https://opencritic.com/critic/9991/luis-alvaro) \\- [3 / 5](https://www.entertainmentgeekly.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review-a-stunning-but-exhausting-samurai-fantasy)\n\n>If you\u2019ve been longing for a classic Assassin\u2019s Creed experience, you\u2019ll find moments of brilliance here\u2014but they come with frustrations as well. And if you\u2019ve grown tired of Ubisoft\u2019s copy-paste open-world formula, Shadows won\u2019t change your mind.\n\n[**Fextralife**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife) \\- Fexelea - [8.5 / 10](https://fextralife.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Expansive, detailed and polished, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a fantastic exploration and stealth game with beautiful Japanese aesthetics, somewhat diminished by a thin story, clumsy narrative, and immersion-breaking design choices. Despite this, it's a thoroughly enjoyable entry into the series for fans seeking to explore medieval Japan.\n\n[**GRYOnline.pl**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl) \\- [Jakub Paluszek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10596/jakub-paluszek) \\- *Polish* \\- [6 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/assassins-creed-shadows-recenzja-gry-rutynowy-otwarty-swiat/z046f0)\n\n>I have experienced quite a few really cool moments while playing Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows, but after 40 hours of playtime all those moments are lost in time like tears in rain. This new Creed has some interesting ideas to shake up the formula, but none of them are good enough to make it count. All in all, any potential for greatness was squandered for yet another opportunity to make a very big game.\n\n[**Game Lodge** ](https://opencritic.com/outlet/927/game-lodge-) \\- [Silvio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10917/silvio-diaz) \\- *Portuguese* \\- [10 / 10](https://gamelodge.com.br/critica-assassins-creed-shadows-o-reconhecimento-para-a-evolucao/)\n\n>The latest game in the franchise is what it is because it looks back and recognizes everything it has done in its history. It brings together the best of all those years and manages to be a brilliant piece of work in every way. Visually beautiful, engaging and extremely fun, combining so many systems. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the best Assassin's Creed ever made and the definitive Medieval Japan game.\n\n[**GameOnly**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly) \\- [Micha\u0142 Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) \\- *Polish* \\- [2.5 / 5 ](https://gameonly.pl/recenzja/recenzja-assassin-s-creed-shadows)\n\n>Throughout the entire game, I had an unpleasant feeling that this was the work of a team taking their first steps on such a large project, heavily drawing from the achievements of their predecessors. This title doesn\u2019t mark a new beginning for the series. On one hand, we get a few innovations that feel like a step forward, but on the other, things that worked well in previous entries are either handled sloppily here or have been completely cut out. It\u2019s a decent option for fans of clearing map markers, but overall, it\u2019s a mediocre production that squandered the potential of a setting that fans of this IP have been waiting for years.\n\n[**Gameffine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/854/gameffine) \\- [Uphar Dutta](https://opencritic.com/critic/9127/uphar-dutta) \\- [80 / 100](https://www.gameffine.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows was supposed to work in the dark to serve the light, but it never managed to step beyond the shadows. It plays it too safe while trying to go back to the roots, but it also goes back on the unwanted systems, including the leveling-based progression. This \u201cone step forward, and two steps back\u201d sentiment makes Shadows just another entry in a long list of Assassin\u2019s Creed games and nothing more.\n\n[**Gameliner**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner) \\- [Patrick Lamers](https://opencritic.com/critic/7468/patrick-lamers) \\- *Dutch* \\- [4 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-stapt-uit-de-schaduw/6099-29-1-194)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a great step forward for the series, with an intriguing story, varied characters, and a well-executed - eventhough a little repetitive - medieval Japan setting, making it a must-have for Assassin's Creed fans and open-world adventure lovers.\n\n[**Gamepressure**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure) \\- [Maciej Bogusz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10595/maciej-bogusz) \\- [7 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-great-combat-and-stealth-where-plo/ze75b)\n\n>Assassin's Creed: Shadows is a game full of contrasts. On one hand, it offers solid stealth mechanics and a great combat system, but on the other, it features a lackluster storyline and generic exploration. If you're a fan of the series, you'll likely find something to enjoy here, but if you weren't convinced from the start, the combat and stealth may not be enough to win you over.\n\n[**Gamer Escape**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/452/gamer-escape) \\- [Eliot Lefebvre](https://opencritic.com/critic/6542/eliot-lefebvre) \\- [8 / 10](https://gamerescape.com/2025/03/18/review-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>And that's really the ultimate takeaway. It has a load of really fun parts, a fun gameplay loop, an engaging story, and an earnest effort to split the difference between the various elements of the franchise history. It's a good game! Take these reservations not as a subversion of that fact, but for what they are: Acknowledgement of its limitations.\n\n[**Gamer Guides**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/733/gamer-guides) \\- [Tom Hopkins](https://opencritic.com/critic/2535/tom-hopkins) \\- [85 / 100](https://www.gamerguides.com/assassins-creed-shadows/review)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows in a nutshell is a more refined, polished game with more of the same formula. This isn\u2019t a big revamp, nor are there any deep changes to the formula. However, it\u2019s the best the series has been for a while. Fun combat, a pair of genuinely interesting protagonists, and a gorgeous recreation of 16th century Japan mean the flaws are easier to overlook.\n\n[**Gfinity**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/803/gfinity) \\- [Alister Kennedy](https://opencritic.com/critic/10213/alister-kennedy) \\- [10 / 10](https://gfinityesports.com/article/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph. Yasuke and Naoe are among the best protagonists the series has ever seen, and the return to stealth gameplay is a massive win for longtime fans.\n\n[**Just Play it**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it) \\- [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) \\- *Arabic* \\- [9 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>An amazing journey that we embarked on in feudal Japan alongside Naoe and Yasuke. The story and gameplay were both thrilling and enjoyable, alongside its massive content, making it undoubtedly Ubisoft's most visually stunning game and the best Assassin's Creed game of the last decade.\n\n[**Kakuchopurei**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei) \\- [Jonathan Toyad](https://opencritic.com/critic/7505/jonathan-toyad) \\- [70 / 100](https://www.kakuchopurei.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review-kkp/)\n\n>\\[...\\] Assassin's Creed Shadow is still a decently fun action adventure-slash-role-playing hybrid (stats, grinding, and all that jazz) if you really need a huge timesink with a ton of money backed onto it. It may not change your mind about the Ubisoft formula of open-world games.\n\n[**Le B\u00eata-Testeur**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/943/le-b-ta-testeur) \\- [Gabriel Desrosiers](https://opencritic.com/critic/11067/gabriel-desrosiers) \\- *French* \\- [9.3 / 10](https://www.lebetatesteur.ca/test-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>This is definitely one of the best games in the franchise. It's a complete game with great improvements, the story is well-constructed, and the player has a lot of freedom in their actions. Without distorting the franchise, I was able to enjoy the game almost as much as the first games. It's not far from equaling Black Flags or the Ezio trilogy.\n\n[**Loot Level Chill**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill) \\- [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) \\- [9.5 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph. An addictive adventure in a stunningly provocative open world, and an absolute must play.\n\n[**Manual dos Games**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/910/manual-dos-games) \\- [Luan Fernandes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10817/luan-fernandes) \\- *Portuguese* \\- [9.2 / 10](https://manualdosgames.com.br/review-assassins-creed-shadows-ps5/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a great game\u2014everything that every fan of the franchise has always imagined. With refined combat, breathtaking scenery, captivating characters, and a simple yet very effective storyline, Shadows is undoubtedly an outstanding game. It brings the Japanese setting to life in an excellent way, and I am sure it will earn its place among Ubisoft's greatest games.\n\n[**MondoXbox**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox) \\- [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) \\- *Italian* \\- [8.8 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3737/assassin-s-creed-shadows.html)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows succeeds in immersing us in a beautiful medieval Japan, full of activities and missions to be carried out with the character we prefer; the settings, the narrative/cinematic approach, and the stealth gameplay are its strengths, but it's a pity for its too weak connection to the franchise's meta-lore and a sometimes disorienting mission structure. Regardless, if you love the series, action RPGs, or Japanese settings, it is a title not to be missed.\n\n[**MonsterVine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine) \\- [Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso) \\- [4 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>While not perfect, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a great ninja simulator and an okay open world game.\n\n[**NextPlay**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/897/nextplay) \\- [Jamie Briggs](https://opencritic.com/critic/10648/jamie-briggs) \\- [8 / 10](https://next-play.com.au/assassins-creed-shadows-review-dont-lose-your-head/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a great entry in the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise and a perfect entry point for newcomers. Its dual protagonists are fantastic and distinct, and while the villains are forgettable, the personal stories of Naoe and Yasuke help deliver a strong narrative. Shadows is visually stunning, with excellent cinematography, beautiful open world, a unique soundtrack and immersive sound design. However, a sparse open world, inconsistent parkour, and a disappointing hideout system, ultimately keep it from reaching true greatness.\n\n[**Nexus Hub**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub) \\- [Sam Aberdeen](https://opencritic.com/critic/4725/sam-aberdeen) \\- [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-assassins-creed-shadows.html)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a formidably big game with a densely packed open-world and great stealth gameplay that should please fans, even if it feels like Ubisoft's formula is starting to wear a bit thin.\n\n[**Noisy Pixel**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/711/noisy-pixel) \\- [Azario Lopez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2507/azario-lopez) \\- [9.5 / 10](https://noisypixel.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a breathtaking evolution of the open-world formula, blending masterful storytelling, refined stealth mechanics, and stunning visuals. With a gripping dual-protagonist narrative and meticulously crafted historical setting, Ubisoft delivers one of the most immersive Assassin\u2019s Creed experiences to date.\n\n[**One More Game**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game) \\- [Chris Garcia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8410/chris-garcia) \\- [8.5 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-ps5-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a notable achievement from Ubisoft, offering an experience that both long-time fans and newcomers are likely to appreciate. This latest addition to the franchise is visually stunning, and its refined stealth systems and other enhancements make it one of the best Assassin's Creed games in recent memory.\n\n[**PSX Brasil**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil) \\- [Thiago de Alencar Moura](https://opencritic.com/critic/3868/thiago-de-alencar-moura) \\- *Portuguese* \\- [90 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/analise/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Based on Naoe's strength as the protagonist and the renewed focus on its stealth gameplay, Assassin's Creed Shadows is yet another resounding success for the franchise. Its only flaw is its inability to put Yasuke on the same level as his companion, a minor thing when so many other elements make it a must-have for those interested in the series or the setting.\n\n[**Play Watch Read**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/831/play-watch-read) \\- [Lindsay Scheerder](https://opencritic.com/critic/10066/lindsay-scheerder) \\- *Dutch* \\- [9 / 10](https://www.playwatchread.nl/play/assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows, the sixteenth installment in the main series, is set in 16th century Japan and follows the stories of Yasuke (an African ronin) and Naoe (a shinobi). Born from a shared mission, their partnership forces them to combine their skills, with Naoe excelling in stealth and precision while Yasuke dominates in direct confrontations. The game offers a refreshing gameplay with an immersive story set in a beautiful setting of the coveted feudal Japan. While the AI \u200b\u200bstill has its shortcomings, such as guards not reacting to nearby attacks, Ubisoft seems to have finally found the right direction for the franchise after a series of disappointing titles, ensuring that both veterans and newcomers will find something to enjoy in this Japanese adventure.\n\n[**PowerUp!**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-) \\- [Leo Stevenson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson) \\- [7.5 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2025/03/19/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ps5-lets-senggoku/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is not a bad game, but it is a flawed one. It's also a beautiful one, an interesting one, a frustrating one, a janky one, a thrilling one and sometimes even a great one. It's a game undone by its own desire to be multiple things all at once.\n\n[**Quest Daily**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/905/quest-daily) \\- [Julian Price](https://opencritic.com/critic/10683/julian-price) \\- [9 / 10](https://questdaily.com.au/review/review-assassins-creed-shadows-ps5/)\n\n>\"Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows doesn\u2019t just capture Feudal Japan \u2014 it immerses you in it.

While some of its elements are a welcome sight, the gatekeeping can feel very offputting at times if you just want to soldier on through the main story. Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is best played when you have a lot of time on your hands to play it.

Whether sneaking through shadows as Noae or charging headfirst into battle as Yasuke, the game offers a dynamic experience making every choice feel consequential. With its immersive setting, refined combat mechanics, and an innovative weather system affecting gameplay, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows elevates the franchise in ways that will leave eager players wanting for more. While Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows might follow some familiar gameplay tropes, its execution is far from formulaic. With a wealth of side content, a customisable hideout system, and the promise of a world teeming with historical intrigue and fierce battles, it is clear Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is poised to be one of the franchise's most memorable and impactful titles. Fans old and new alike will find much to love in this stunning and daring chapter in the Assassin\u2019s Creed saga.\n\n[**XGN.nl**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/810/xgn-nl) \\- [Luuc ten Velde](https://opencritic.com/critic/8359/luuc-ten-velde) \\- *Dutch* \\- [8.7 / 10](https://www.xgn.nl/review/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>With Assassin's Creed Shadows, Ubisoft sticks to a familiar formula but executes it brilliantly. Add to that the new weather and season systems, along with the expanded base-building mechanics, and we\u2019re convinced that waiting for an Assassin\u2019s Creed set in Japan was more than worth it.\n\n[**Xbox Tavern**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/949/xbox-tavern) \\- [Ian Wray](https://opencritic.com/critic/11183/ian-wray) \\- [9.6 / 10](https://www.xboxtavern.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is everything I wanted from the series and more. The world is stunning, the combat is thrilling, and the dual-protagonist system adds so much variety to gameplay. Playing as both characters sometimes feels like experiencing two different games, thanks to their unique playstyles. The deep storytelling kept me completely immersed, and I never once felt bored. For me, it\u2019s an absolute must-play for any fan of the series.\n\n[**XboxEra**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera) \\- [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) \\- [9.5 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>AC Shadows is the best game in what has been an incredible series.\n\n[**ZTGD**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd) \\- [Terrence Johnson](https://opencritic.com/critic/8293/terrence-johnson) \\- [9 / 10](https://ztgd.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-xsx/)\n\n>Quote not yet available",

If you ever played FC6 it's one of the worst open world games to just walk around in. It's honestly an achievement for how dull and boring they make their worlds. \n\nIf you enjoy it that's fine it's a very casual game, I don't really take ubisoft seriously. I oay like 8-15 bucks tops and that's when they're worth it. \n\nWatching ppl pay like 80 bucks for the same thing over an over again is wild though, I think that stuff kinda hurts the industry by showing people will pay for in my opinion just lazy games.

I love from soft but their technical side is a mess and has really stagnated in terms of improvement. \n\nDemon souls and dark souls had some genuinely big issues, I mean blight town wasn't the bane of every player by pure design. After those two games the big issues were pretty okay, excluding OG demon souls 2,but then again these games really live and die by their visual design because technically the graphics are piss pore.\n\nYou see so many games get Thorn apart for having inconsistent framerates, low-res Textures, reused animations and assets, etc... Things from soft has made millions by doing. I love their games, currently playing Elden Ring again, but by God does it have issues. Getting frequent frame rate drops, IN performance mode, in a game that is still running on a PS3 era engine should not happen from one of the biggest gaming studios in the world.\n\nGraphics aren't everything so yes, the games looking dated aren't the biggest issue, however a game with good art direction AND up-to-date graphics IS a better game. Just look at Demon's souls remake. \n\nThe issues that come up around framerates and iffy PC ports SHOULD not be excused however. As much as I consider them amongst the best games I've played, I struggle to honestly call any of them a 10/10 perfect game.",

Not all of them of course but it's something I've noticed over the last 10 or so years. Almost every game has an element of 'jank' but titles like AC Valhalla have combat that acts wonky sometimes, audio that's weirdly compressed or enemies that clip into you mid dialogue. It's not automatically bad since Bethesda games were popular for their funny levels of jank and even The Witcher 3 had its own fair share of janky moments, but sometimes it makes their games feel a bit off. It's like the different pieces of their games don't interact very well with each other.",
