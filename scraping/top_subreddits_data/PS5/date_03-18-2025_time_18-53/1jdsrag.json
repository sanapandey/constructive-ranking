Imagine Romero suing Duke Nukem 3D because it copied shooting and movement mechanics as well as hud design and other artistic similarities. Same with the competition between Quake and Unreal Tournament. Imagine every shooter after doom being forced to remove rocket jumping, or in legalese \"the action of moving rapidly in a given direction due to player controlled explosives.\"\n\nRegardless of how derivative they are, you correctly admitted that creating cute monster designs is not illegal. There is nothing that makes what Palworld is doing worse than say what Pocket pair originally did making various similar designs to monsters from SMT, or what Marvel and DC have been doing with each other for years. And as we've established, patenting game mechanics is an abhorrent practice in the industry that just holds games back. There's a reason you can only find a handful of examples and only from the scummiest companies.\n\nI'll never understand why some people have an obsession defending large corporations. I'll never glaze Palworld, I think it's a fun game but nothing particularly special, but no developer deserves to be sued in anticompetitive, abusive ways to stifle fair and legal competition.",

Japanese gaming companies especially patent stuff all the time as a protection from outside patent trolling. They just usually never sue each other over these mechanics. However, obviously rip off another company's character designs in a legally distinct way and hand them guns, even though that franchise and company is notiorusly kid-friendly, and the gloves may come off. \n\n>than say what Pocket pair originally did\n\nYeah, because PP are creative leeches that never had an original idea in their lives. Their last game was a shitty BotW clone down to recreating Bokoblin camps (only without the amazing system-based gameplay, of course) and Palworld rips off stuff not only from Pokemon, but also Dark Souls/Elden Ring, Fortnite, survival games like Ark and Rust etc. I have no sympathy for these people and framing it as if they of all studios are somehow fighting a fight for creativity and innovation and fair competition is irony of the highest order.\n\n>abusive ways to stifle fair and legal competition\n\nPP could've simply come up with their own creature designs (and not ripped off Pokeballs, too), and I doubt Nintendo would've had any problem with their game, just as they never had any problems with Digimon or Monster Rancher or Cassette Beasts or god-knows how many other monster-catching games/franchises.",

And it is patently (harrharr) false, whatever you think Nintendo's motivation was to file those patents (which, btw, Japanese gaming companies file all sorts of patents all the time, it's not like this is anything unusual). And, seeing as Palworld wouldn't come out until 2024, I'd say PP had more than ample time to adjust their game to where it doesn't infringe on any patents from the franchise they were obviously ripping off. I mean, they were smart enough to go just as far as legally possible with their creature designs, after all lol\n\nAlso, Nintendo isn't even asking for a lot of money, so that \"waiting until it made a lot of money\" doesn't make any sense (and as if Nintendo, as one of the richest companies in Japan, needs pocket change from PP lol). The lawsuit is probaby more about brand protection than anything else because Pocket Pair chose to brazenly market their game off the back of Nintendo's biggest franchise.",

But that doesn't mean that the ripped-off designs are not the reason behind why Nintendo chose to sue in the first place. Because they, like basically all other big Japanese gaming studios, actually hold a shitload of patents over which they could sue all kinds of companies for.

Also again, they cannot do so over the designs themselves, even though they are very obvious ripoffs, so they chose the patents. And you are batshit crazy if you think that other companies wouldn't act in the same way, given the chance. If you made e.g. a legally distinct Astrobot copy with a real gun that sets the internet ablaze, I bet Sony wouldn't be all too pleased and looking at all their options, too.\n\n>Hopefully this opens the floodgates to more games.\n\nThe \"floodgates\" have been open for decades lol.

However, this is purely an unspoken gentleman's agreement, so to speak. So, if, hypothetically, a studio were to come along and, say, market their game off the back of the biggest franchise of another company while also ripping off many of their creature designs as closely as legally possible, and do so in a way that the other company finds pretty unsavoury (maybe because said big franchise is aimed mainly at kids and the game is portraying the copycat designs with firearms), then that might not be considered very gentlemanly behaviour and that company might investigate what kind of patents it has lying around that could become a problem for that studio.",

It's practically proven, no one gives a damn what the monsters look like, they never really did. The pokemon design has never been a selling point. But the catching mechanic is.\n\n\nI found that quite interesting, and it makes a lot of sense. Only thing that doesn't make sense to me is the people that think putting Arceus in the game would increase or decrease its sales.\n\n\nAnd quite honestly.. yes.
