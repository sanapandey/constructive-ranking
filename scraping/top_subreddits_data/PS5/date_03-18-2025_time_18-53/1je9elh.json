They are free now to cook up a great RPG system that builds on it but is designed with videogames in mind \n\nThe d&d one was a great experiment for one game, but I think they already maxed it out in terms of what they could do with this rpg system. other than new race/classes which becomes a slog because they cant really take out the core ones so its an exponential workload to give them all unique interactions and dialog. And the core ones are kind of set in stone so they can't really mix it up either, so it seems a bit dead the idea of repeating the exact same progressions in a second game for me as a player",
