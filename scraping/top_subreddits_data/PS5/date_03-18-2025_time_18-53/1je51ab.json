So, the investment for a single player game will be a lot less, unless it's a large company that has a proven track record with high hype, high sales games (CDPR, Rockstar, Bethesda, etc.). \n\nThere's a ton of excellent single player games out there and many are in top 10/20 lists. But, when it comes to how much they earn? Multiplayer will be on the top of the lists due to the ongoing costs of playing. One time $60 game vs. $60 game plus $10 monthly PSLive sub plus however much for new outfits, loot boxes, whatever. It adds up. \n\nI'm way more of a single player person. But, seeing what some people spend on those multiplayer games, I can see how they get more attention from studios and the higher sales numbers (not in per sold, but overall $$). \n\nThey are far from dead, though.

Single player games are as strong as ever, and a lot of the MTX ridden ones are being pushed further and further away by an audience that is beginning to get sick of them, especially when there are now alternatives.\n\nWith the failures of all these GaaS (xDefiant, Concord, all the Smash Bros knock offs, etc), I think it can be argued that multiplayer games are the ones that are dying outside of the big established hitters. Marvel Rivals is probably the only newer game that looks like it's going to have staying power (and also Valorant, forgot about that). Thing is, Valo and Marvel Rivals are both very clearly \"inspired\" by other source material (Overwatch, Counter Strike) with no meaningful separation. They're very much both in the same vein. The rest of them are fairly old. Stuff like League are now closer to the 2 decade mark, DOTA even more so, Counter Strike approaching 3 decades.\n\n  \nMeanwhile in the single player space it seems like every year you have absolute gems coming out, and a lot of newer IPs are even starting to make their way like Metaphor, Astro Bot, etc.",

Plenty of amazing games that exist that don't get the push bc they're not visually attractive enough. Even among indies, Stardew Valley had very warm, inviting pixel visuals and great UI design.

People just want something good, something worth their money.\n\nIt's a bit more than this. People also want something new and novel. And these media companies don't like that. They want sure fire bets, so they keep leaning on the fallacy that \"what people like today, they will continue to like tomorrow\" despite that not ever being really true. Main stream audiences liked Marvel movies because they were new and exciting. They are old now, so the novelty has worn off and even the good ones aren't as successful as the prior big hits were. It's diminishing returns all the way down. \n\nSequels and remakes are safer bets than new IPs are, but the problem we are about to run into is that if you only make sequels and remakes, those properties will eventually fall out of style and because these companies bet so hard on expanding existing IP, they will be left with little-to-no newer IPs to make sequels/remakes of 20 years from now. Yet these companies continue to over-leverage existing IP to the point where they are killing off brands with decades of strength behind them by trying to do too much with them at once. They're hitting us with a firehose full of old IP which will quickly run out of water, when they should be trickling them out to help ensure they maintain their popularity forever. Problem is, shareholders only care about your quarterly earnings, not your long-term financial health. Once they squeeze out as much value as they can as quickly as they can, they will simply divest and move that money to somewhere else where they can do the same thing with it. \n\nIt's basically like forestry.  For every tree you cut down, you need to plant some new ones to ensure you have more trees to harvest in the future.",

Then the studio is blamed when it flops because they had no idea how to make a good multiplayer game all because some suit wanted to do a \"get rich quick\" scheme. At best their reputation just takes a big hit like Bioware and Anthem and at worst the whole studio gets shut down like with Arkane Austin and Redfall. \n\nYour premise relies on the developers actually wanting to make something with a clear vision that people will actually want when time and time again that's not the case. It's not \"selfish\" and \"unreasonable\" to say that maybe it's a bad idea to push devs to do that and then punish them when it naturally doesn't work out.",

Like how the Redfall team were hoping the game would simply get cancelled because they just hated making it. \n\nYou're acting like making a multiplayer game is a golden opportunity that devs are dying to make across the board. It's probably going to flop because there are so many big online games out there already that demand so much attention for battlepasses and whatnot and if the devs have no experience or passion to give it a try it will be a directionless mess that just apes whatever the suits wanted them to make. \n\nYou don't force a singleplayer focused RPG studio to make a multiplayer shooter, just like you don't force a fish to climb a tree.",
