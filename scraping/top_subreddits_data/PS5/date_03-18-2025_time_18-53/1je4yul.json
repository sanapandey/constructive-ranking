Because for every loser playing at being a streamer there's a hundred of not thousands of goons eating it up by watching",

If your \"someone who never plays\" can get behind some light 3D platforming, you should be good. Death is *very* forgiving; the penalty for death is just a cool down you can shorten with a QTE (or just an automatic respawn), unless both players die, in which case you only lose a couple minutes of progress at most.\n\nThere are of course other mechanics on top of the platforming but generally the learning curve on them is very generous.",
