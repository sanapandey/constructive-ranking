The gameplay is *far* too good in ways no other studio is doing for me to care about subpar character writing. \n\nIt's ok for video games to be extremely fun to play and that's it imo. Too many people treating compelling cinematic drama like an inherent requirement of a good game. \n\nI mean obviously it's awesome when a rare AAA game manages to achieve equal excellence in both gameplay and storytelling. But when we have devs making awesome stuff that nobody else is making I'd rather they focus on that vs diverting effort toward doing the same shit everyone else is doing.",

They are one of very few companies that are building co-op experiences through every lens of game creation imaginable -- in that that might be alone.\n\nThe studio also gets bonus points for Josef Fares being a passionate looney and endearing guy, and Hazelight's commitment to making their games affordably enjoyable.\n\nI also find it funny his brother's name is Fares Fares.",
