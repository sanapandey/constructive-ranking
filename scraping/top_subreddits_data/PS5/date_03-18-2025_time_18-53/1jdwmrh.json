    "selftext": "I hate any kind of pop-ups appearing when I'm playing any game. It breaks my immersion especially if they appear during crucial moments. For PS4 and PS5 games, developers can flag parts of their game to prevent recording or screenshots, usually to hide spoilers, or because of music licensing agreements. [When you get to one of these parts, a pop-up appears](https://i.imgur.com/WyeeIOk.jpeg) regardless if you're recording or not because the PS4/PS5 is always recording so you can easily make clips.\n\n[This was fine on PS4, because you can turn off that pop-up. ](https://i.imgur.com/tLW0eu4.jpeg)Throughout the PS4's life-cycle, I turned this off and never thought of it again. However, for some reason, there is no option to turn this off on PS5. At best, it's an annoyance that will inform you that you're about to see a big spoiler. At worst, it can make some games unplayable if the pop-up occurs mid-game and obstructs the game's UI. The most egregious example of this is Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, which triggers the pop-up whenever licensed music cuts in or out. \n\n[This problem has been around since PS5 launch](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/jtofj7/how_do_you_turn_off_gameplay_recording_paused/) and is still not fixed. I do not want to have to look up whether or not a game has blocked scenes before I decide to buy it on PS5 or Steam. I do not even want to record gameplay, for trophies or otherwise. I want to live in the moment as I'm playing a game without any distractions. I hope Sony does something about this soon, whether by letting us turn off ALL pop-up notifications as you could on PS4, or turning off recording altogether. ",

If the game developer can't block people from recording the password while logging into their Ubisoft or whatever account. That opens up many liability issues. Unfortunately that is how businesses are. You need to do stuff to protect your business. I'm not saying any developer won't do their own thing and start blocking stuff that they can't be liable for, which sucks. However the liability factor ensures them having this ability to block scenes in the first place. Why should Sony take on the liability of their game developers? That doesn't make any sense. Just let them block that stuff and let them be liable for their own stuff. Yeah, that sucks for content creators using these recordings, but at least PS5 is still available because they haven't been sued to oblivion.\n\nI want to be clear. I in no way said you wanted people's passwords to be recorded. However you said that the developers should not be able to stop recording in any part of the game. \"any part of the game\" includes recording during people entering passwords. So, that's why I brought it up. There needs to be some sort of line drawn. Not just no stopping recording. Especially, because the PS5 is always recording. It doesn't always save it, but you can click it anytime and save the last 60 minutes of whatever you're playing.",

I have tried playing completely offline. I have tried disabling HDMI CEC. None of these worked.

Even if you mute all notifications this obnoxious popup keeps showing up. It might be less common with ps5 games but it absolutely still occurs on the ps5 with no possible way to disable it.",

Pretty much all of Atlus's games released before they became more streamer-friendly still have blocked scenes. Some do patch it though; many spoiler scenes in FF7 Remake were blocked on release but are not anymore, and there were no blocked scenes in FF7 Rebirth.\n\nPublishers blocking recording for licensed music, like in Sparking Zero, are probably just doing is as lip service for the licensor. It seems most of Sony's games don't have them, but I bet if Death Stranding 2 has a bunch of blocked scenes due to licensed music, there will be more pitchforks about this.\n\nI also did test games that only mute the audio for recording, like Project Diva Future Tone, on PS5 and there is no pop-up luckily.",
