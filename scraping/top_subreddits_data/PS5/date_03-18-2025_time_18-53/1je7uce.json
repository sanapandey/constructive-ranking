It\u2019s fairly easy to get most of the paid content for free just by playing the game unless you really want all of the armor cosmetics. \n\nI have half the premium warbonds for free and even if I paid for the others, I wouldn\u2019t be able to unlock anything without playing the game for medals during which time I\u2019d have earned the currency needed for the ones I paid for.",

That's not good game design.",

I play purely on lvl 8-10 and I barely have medals to unlock warbond items as I buy them with free credits. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine actually having medals available if you played on the lower difficulties and quit to just farm super credits. Also, why bother doing that when you\u2019re still only earning like $2 an hour in super credits.\n\nThe fact is if you only want the warbonds and not cosmetics, you barely earn enough medals to unlock stuff at the same rate you find credits. Not everything has to be meta farmed like some neckbeard warrior. It\u2019s not the game designers fault if someone wants to intentionally not have fun just to earn an extra $1 an hour that they would have to wait to enjoy after playing missions on higher difficulties for medals.",

I haven't played since the first or second Battlepass. I hopped in for one game a month ago or so and it was exactly the same, minus a couple new enemies. I've experienced everything the game has to offer and am probably done with it. \n\nThat said, I'm glad other people are able to enjoy it and are getting consistent updates and features.",
