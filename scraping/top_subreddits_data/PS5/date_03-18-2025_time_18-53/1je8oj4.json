I didn\u2019t like any of the story post >!killing Barnabas!<, it just loses all of its steam for me after that. For what it\u2019s worth, 15 is one of my favorite games of all time, but holy crap if it doesn\u2019t have a good amount of flaws, mostly with the story requiring so much outside material from the game and all of the DLC to be a cohesive story.  I\u2019m not forcing any of that",

Being a numbered FF, you would assume it's the main team working on it, but that's not the case as the main teams are working on the FF7 remakes. That in itself is the main issue. It plays like the non-numbered games. It lacks a lot of what makes a numbered FF game polished.\n\nIf it was labeled as something else, I think it wouldn't have as much negative reception as it did.",
