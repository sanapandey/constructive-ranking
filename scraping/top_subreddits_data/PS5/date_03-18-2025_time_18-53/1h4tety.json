Playstation no longer informs me via notification when items on my wishlist go on sale, so there's times I may well have missed out on an offer I might have taken.\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile it doesn't seem to stop notifying me when items have downloaded, and friends come online, and all notifications are set to always show on the playstation.",

However, when I start up a game to play, the game doesn't recognize any of my button or directional inputs as if my controller is disconnected. I can still use PS button to open the Quick Menu or return to the Home Screen, and I can still use the Capture Button, and I can still navigate through those menus just fine. Just any other button presses goes ignored. \n\nThankfully for others that have this problem, I have discovered a temporary solution. After booting up a game of your choice, open the Quick Menu and select the Accessories Tab (The one with the controller symbol). Then, in that menu select the controller that is connected, and then select 'Turn Off', which obviously shuts off the controller. After that, you just need to turn the controller back on while the game is running and the game should now respond to your inputs. However, if you want to play another game, you will have to do this process again. So it can get very tedious. \n\nI am curious if anyone else is having this issue. If someone is, I hope the paragraph above is helpful in fixing this problem for you. If anyone knows what might be going and can offer better solutions, I'd be more than happy to hear them! \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this post.",

For context: I would say about a month ago my console started freaking out. Basically as soon as I turn on the console it moves to my left. I know it\u2019s not common stick drift because I bought a new controller and the same problem happened. It\u2019s like the console itself moves my to left on Home Screen or even in games without me touching the left joystick as soon as I first move my left analog stick (even with new controller). I\u2019m not really sure how to fix this as I already factory reset my console and its still is happening. If anyone has had this problem please tell me how to fix it. By the way I\u2019m connected to an acer monitor if that provides more context",

            "body": "I\u2019m another homie that got a PS5 for Christmas. I\u2019m a PC gamer so I\u2019m more involved with online multiplayer games.\n\nThat said, the PS5 has some great looking games that I\u2019d be hyped to journey through when not feeling competitive. I jumped right into God of War (I think it\u2019s the first one for PS4, not Ragnarok) and was a bit underwhelmed. The combat seemed repetitive (same combos and animations) and the adventuring seemed dull too. The boss fights also seemed pretty predictable. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019ve died a few times, but it feels a bit bland. I\u2019m only a few hours in and at this point I\u2019m just playing because everyone said it was a must-buy. Maybe I just haven\u2019t hit the good stuff yet? I know I can upgrade my gear and unlock new skills but I\u2019m just not pumped for it. I reached the area where the world serpent comes out and the water levels go down. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ve actually fought any bosses or if they were just mini-bosses to slowly introduce me in. I like the dialogue (interactions between Kratos and \u201cBoy\u201d lol) and the little hidden collectibles (such as sealed chests and the green birds) but the gameplay itself feels watered down.\n\nCan anyone recommend games that are exciting, unpredictable, and challenging? Here are some recent-ish non-online-multiplayer games that I\u2019ve enjoyed:\n\n- It Takes Two\n- Stardew Valley\n- Elden Ring (played on PC, didn\u2019t finish. Might pick up for PS5)\n- Skyrim\n- Zelda series (pretty much loved all Zelda games. personal favorite is between Windwaker and TOTK)\n\nGames that I think look fun but unsure about:\n- Cyberpunk (not particularly excited about the type/theme of the world but every other element in it looks great)\n- Last of Us 1-2 (people say GOW is better so not sure how this changes my excitement)\n- Sekiro (Looks challenging, like Elden Ring but samurai)\n- Split Fiction (not out yet but absolutely excited for it)\n- FF7 remakes (Not sure if I\u2019m really excited for this or if it\u2019s just nostalgia)\n- Ghost of Tsushima (I heard this gets repetitive and is overrated yet somehow continuously praised)\n- Horizon (Same comment as Ghost of Tsushima)",

(Pro/Digital/Disc/Slim etc). Based on what I've read, the standard disc version seems to be the most value. \n\n2. Are Discs specific to region? Eg if the game is purchased in country A, can it be played in another country? \n\n3. What about DLC? Eg. A game like Mortal Kombat 1 was released and then had multiple DLCs released. If using the disc version, how does one get access to the dlcs? Apologies if my questions are dumb, but I hope you can help. Thank you.",

DLC, however, is region locked and the disc needs to match the region of your PSN account to be able to buy/redeem DLC. The physical console region is irrelevant, just the account region.",

Someone truly encountering the medium for the first time is going to struggle with a lot of basic principles simply because there's no real-world analog.\n\nYou have free access to a game called \"Astro's Playroom\"; it *should* have been pre-installed on your console, but otherwise you can access it from the store for free.  I'm not going to call it \"accessible\" in this case because suffers from the same expectation that the player know how to \"play\", but what it *is* is extremely forgiving and extremely low-stakes.  There's no capacity to lose progress or \"fail\" in any meaningful way, and there's no story or timer to drive you forward \u2014 you can spend an hour or two or ten or a hundred just existing in the 3D space and gaining basic familiarity with the game controller and how your input is reflected in a virtual space.\n\nIt *is* certainly possible that video gaming isn't \"for you\" like any number of other hobbies, but you've also not been afforded the opportunity to figure that out for yourself \u2014 plopping you in front of a video game from 2021 and deciding \"this isn't for you\" when it doesn't go well is kind of like handing a copy of Finnegans Wake to someone whose just learned their ABCs and then concluding that they don't like reading.

I have absolutely no idea why we need so many names for essentially the same things but that\u2019s besides the point.\nI came here in hopes that someone could answer these questions for me before I make any hasty purchases.\n\n1. What is the BEST option for expanding my console storage? I want one that will give me 2 Tb of additional storage.\n\n2. I\u2019m seeing on the PS Store that they are selling a Seagate Game Drive 2TB Internal PS5 NVMe SSD for $179.99 and a 2TB WD BLACK SN850P NVMe SSD for $209.99; what\u2019s with the price difference? And what\u2019s the better buy?\n\n3. Once I do purchase and install one of these storage expansions how does it work? Do I install it and my normal 600gb storage becomes bigger? Or will the SSD appear separately from my original storage?\n\n3b. If the second option is the reality, do I have to choose whether my games are installed on my base storage(600gb) or the newly installed SSD? And what would be better?\n\n4. If I remove the SSD is game progress stored there? And can I just install it into another p5 and have that game data there?\n\nThere\u2019s probably a bunch more questions I\u2019ll have about these but none are coming to mind right now. If anyone sees this and decides to help me out I really appreciate it.",

                    "body": "First of all, \"so many names for essentially the same things\" is just plain wrong. Sure, both HDDs and SSDs store data but SSDs are simply better and more modern technology. The only thing going for HDDs at this point is the cheaper price, but you would not want that to be your PS5's main drive. Anyway, about your questions:\n\n1. M.2 SSD, such as either one of those mentioned in your second question. An external HDD could be a good idea as well for your PS4 games, since that leaves the SSDs free for PS5 games only. Of course, that only applies if you play any PS4 games. Pretty much any external HDD (or SSD) is fine for storage use, but you can't play PS5 games off of them so yeah, M.2 drive for PS5 games.\n\n2. The price difference really comes down to brand, more reputable brands can afford to ask for more. There might be some differences in durability as well, but for PS5 use all M.2 drives with a read speed of 5500MB/s are essentially identical. The Seagate you mention is actually a bit faster than WD, but again, that's 100% irrelevant for PS5 use. Pick the cheaper option in this case, and remember to either buy a version that comes with a heatsink or get your own heatsink. WD Black having a higher price might also be explained by it coming with a heatsink, though you don't mention it and it usually is mentioned in the product name.\n\n3. The latter. You can choose the drive where to install your games in the console's storage settings. The extra M.2 would be a better install location since it's a bit faster than PS5's own internal drive, but according to real-life tests the differences in loading speeds are 0.5-2 seconds in favor of the extra M.2. Hence my earlier mention of all drives being essentially identical. Your game data is on the console's internal drive which you can't remove, and possibly in the cloud if you have any PS+ sub. If you were to install games on the extra M.2 drive, remove it and install it into another console you'd have the games but not the saves.",

I know you mentioned that the seagate and WD are essentially the same with minor differences in speed and effectiveness. But the thing I\u2019m stuck on is the heatsink. I heard everywhere that not having one can make that extra space go bye bye VERY fast due to overheating. And if the seagate doesn\u2019t have one is it safe to install? Or would I NEED one before installing? Or am I bad at reading and it actually does have a  heatsink?",

Back when I used to have a PS4 on my desk, I'd just run an aux cord from the controller to a JBL bluetooth speaker and that was good enough but I believe I read that it doesn't work the same for the PS5 controller?

I recently got a physical copy of Metaphor: ReFantazio, and with it came a code I could redeem for a little DLC pack, including exp items and a \u2018journey pack\u2019. I entered the code on PlayStation Store and was prompted to download said dlc items, but then I accidentally clicked away before downloading. Now if I try entering the code again, it says the code has already been redeemed, and I don\u2019t have the items, and can\u2019t find them in my library. Launching the game also doesn\u2019t give me any option to redeem those items anywhere. Has anyone experienced a similar issue with download codes? Is there a way for me to still get that content or is it gone forever? Sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to ask",

This isn't a recent issue, since I've had it since I bought the system, but now with the 30th anniversary themes I wanted to hear the nostalgic boot up sounds again. However, No matter what I do or what sound options I pick, I can't get the machine to make any sounds during boot up. I play with headphones, but even when I switch headphones it doesn't work. Connecting them to the device itself or the controller makes no difference either.\n\nAgain, the problem is only with boot up sounds. As soon as I pick a user, sound starts up normally and works perfectly fine the whole time I play. It is specifically in the boot process that there is no sound. It's like the console doesn't output any sound until the user is picked.\n\nFor clarity, my console is PS5 slim with disk drive, and my regular headphones are Blackshark V2 X, although even using different headphones made no difference.\n\nThank you very any help!",

I hope you guys can help us. Below some things that we considered for:\n\nWe like to play story mode, we'd like to remember Naruto and Naruto shippuden stories and their characters (kids, akatsuki, kages, etc.).\n\nIt would be good to have a huge character roster that includes non main story characters (Tayuya, Kimimaro, etc.)\n\nWe also like to play both together if possible battling 2v2 (kind of games like it takes 2). If not, it's fine doing 1v1.\n\nWe don't mind about any Boruto spoilers (chars, story, etc.). In fact, it could encourage us to see the series.\n\nWe'll play in PS5, so please also recommend if X game is better to get PS4 version for a smooth gameplay in PS5 (like Elden Ring).",

External HDDs (and SSDs) can also play PS4 games. If you want extra storage to both install and play your PS5 games you'll need an internal M.2 SSD. They're a bit more expensive and require you to open the console to install, but it's not difficult at all nor does it void your warranty. You won't mess it up, there are detailed guides for that. In terms of what's required of the drive it must have a read speed of at least 5500MB/s and must be between 250GB-8TB. Samsung 990 Pro and WD Black SN850x are arguably the most popular drives due to their reliability, speed and fair price, and both have versions that come with heatsinks-pre installed. If you buy that version you only need to install the drive to the console, otherwise you need to have your own heatsink.",

The audio kept playing fine and the PS5 menus were nice and responsive so I was thinking it might've been the disk itself, cleaned it, same problem, but I jus had too wait a minute or 2 on the PS5 home menu for it to fix itself, but today I saved the game, exited the save menu, went to retrieve my lunch, ready to watch Netflix, but when I returned my game was frozen yet again, but I had already saved so I was like \"ykno what I'ma jus close the game atp\" and the PS5 turned itself off, I turned it back on using the physical power button scared ASF, checked it's storage thingy to make sure everything is fine, and jus gave me the error code from the title stating it's a software issue, i read about how the PS5 screen turned black then acts normal but never turning the entire system off, is this a faulty hardware issue or something that must be resolved through software updates? I could see it being both by either faulty GPU or the software jus having a stroke and overloading the PS5 until it turns itself off\n\nBtw I don't play PS5 games cuz my controller has extreme drift, I use my dual shock 4 so only PS4 games, also yes every single other game works fine, exclusively rdr2, is it cuz it's the most intensive ps4 game? No clue, leaves me asking if it's software or hardware, do I have a faulty unit? Or will Sony have to fix it over time",

Of course there's a decent chance some of those PS4 games have received PS5 versions which you may want to download instead. For pretty much all online games all player data is stored on game servers, only settings are local indeed. I'm not familiar with those SSD brands you mentioned, but a little Googling says that they're fully compatible with the console. I'd say go for either of those, unless they don't come with the 5-year warranty that's so common with many SSDs.",

I'm impressed. It feels great, the face buttons feel nicer and not as loose, the analog sticks have more range and smoothness, the d-pad plastic feels softer and nicer, and the controller is overall quieter than the DS4.\n\nI also bought an XboX Series X controller, and it's horrible by comparison, and I'd rather keep using a DualShock 4 controller: there's too much tension on the triggers, the D-pad is hard plastic and offensively clicky, and it misses repeat presses, the face buttons take too much effort to press and so they can't be rapid-pressed as quickly as the DS4 and DS face buttons, the analog sticks have less range than the DS4's (which have less range than the DualSense's), and they have too much tension, making it hard to make nuanced and precise movements. The Xbox controller makes way too much noise in all ways, while the DS controller is nicely quiet.\n\nThe DualSense feels amazing  to me, much better than a DS4 than I expected, and it makes the X Series X controller seem like an amateur, cheaply-built budget controller, IMO.\n\nBut I wouldn't mind having a bit more tension on the DualSense's triggers. I see that the springs in them can be replaced easily enough:\n\n[https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=dualsense+trigger+spring&ref=nb\\_sb\\_noss](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=dualsense+trigger+spring&ref=nb_sb_noss)\n\nI'm wondering if there are any replacement springs for sale that are a bit stronger and will give just a little more pushback on the triggers. And has anyone tried putting two springs on each of the triggers?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xw5bdquia65e1.jpeg?width=2858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3db402131d9967d6be02716d8a24ec69aed3547b",

This is weird as this doesnt happen on all games. For example Plague Tale Requem is Perfect and its very demanding game. It looks like specific type of foliage causes this. I tried other games and there is NO ISSUE at all - Infiniti nikki, tlou part 1 remake, uncharted 4, resident evil 4 remake. All of them have foliage and are demanding and theres no issue. I AM wondering of this is some sort of glitch caused by some new firmware... Fualty hardware should show on more games shouldnt it\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: issue showed up on Infinity Nikki in some cases.

It does not mean that internal 1440p resolution isn't supported, it's referring to external resolution which you're always keeping at 4k anyway. Why Series X would support it but not PS5 I dunno, but probably has something to do with Xbox supporting more things in general such as Freesync.\n\nAs for SSD that depends. If you ordered a non-Pro new PS5 it would be a Slim at this point, which has 825GB of space. I have a release day console which has 667GB, and I don't think it even took a year to run out of space, forcing me to delete some stuff. That was even with having an external HDD for PS4 games and there simply not being as many PS5 games in 2021, unless you play just a few games I can't imagine the console's own space being enough in 2024. With Pro and its 2TB sure, but not 825GB. Although if you mostly play single player stuff which you can safely delete after completing I'd say that 825GB will last a bit longer, but for multiplayer live services it becomes inadequate really fast. In other words, whether it's worth the cost depends on the games you play, but I'd say for most people it is worth it.",

His ps5 has always been a bit laggy but never this bad. He says the only way to fix it is factory resetting it, but im sure theres something else he can do. He has alot of screenshots on there that he'd like to keep, too. Google says its because of overheating, caused by extended hours of gaming but he doesnt even play that long.

All the internals seem to be well shielded from the outside and all of the vents are on the sides anyways (as in the horizontal position), so is there any real possibility of any damage if something is put on top of it? \n\nAnd most importantly, is [storing things like that](https://imgur.com/a/eQg30vn) a threat to the console? While the DAC is essentially featherweight, the two DualSenses with their charger have more weight to them, but I wouldn't consider them to be particularly heavy. I also placed them in an area where there is little to no heat when the PS5 is turned on",

I\u2019m using my older Acer 27\u201d ED270RP monitor, which supports 144Hz (https://www.acer.com/gb-en/monitors/gaming/nitro-ed0/pdp/UM.HE0EE.P04).\n\nMy question is: is it possible to achieve a higher frame rate than I\u2019m currently getting\u2014specifically, a stable 120fps\u2014if I buy a new monitor? I\u2019m aware of the HDMI 2.1 cable limitation. Would it be possible to play Warzone at a frame rate higher than 120fps if I get a monitor with, for example, a 240Hz refresh rate and an HDMI 2.1 connection?",

So I wanted to ask your opinion! Below I listed a few pros and cons, in my personal perspective\n\nBG3\n\nReasons for:\n\n- Excellent reviews which mean the game has got to be a GOAT contender\n- Sharp writing and great storyline\n- I generally like turn based gameplay. Some examples i really enjoyed: Xcom 2, Fallout 1 and 2, 13 sentinels, etc\n\nReasons against:\n\n- i watched a gameplay video and the vibe i got was that the gameplay is way too complicated. Too many buttons on the screen, too many items etc\n- I dont really know the DnD language at all\n\nDragon Age Veilguard\n\nReasons for:\n\n- Gameplay looks very fun. More action like compared to BG3. Shortcut buttons on the screen, and progress system looks simple enough (compared to BG3)\n- Looks similar to many games i enjoyed: Witcher 3, various Assassins Creed games, God of War Ragnarok etc\n\nReasons against:\n\n- i am not familiar with the lore as i have never played any prior games\n- i also read about some online fan backlash? Some reputable reviewers think this game is bad\n\n\nReFantazio\n\nReasons for:\n\n- Excellent reviews and GOAT contender\n- I generally like JRPG, and also like anime style games\n- Gameplay looks interesting, as a mix between simulation and dungeon \n\nReasons against:\n\n- Big one\u2014 I bought Persona 5 a couple years ago and despite trying to play for a couple hours, never really got into it and gave up. Want to pick it up again though\n\nAgain, thank you for sharing your opinions! Feel free to ask me questions like \u201cdid you like this game?\u201d Etc",

Not everyone is going to like every single game, even ones with near-perfect scores on Metacritic, and that\u2019s okay; people have different personalities & aren\u2019t a hivemind.\n\nThat said, if you didn\u2019t like Persona 5, you\u2019re not going to like Metaphor, so that one\u2019s out. BG3 may look a little complicated, but you get eased into it, and you can reduce the difficulty if you so choose, so that\u2019s probably the one.",

I was going to restart so i didnt mind it that much but after getting around 15 hours into my new save all my data was deleted again. Since then ive come back to the game to try to play again, however the same issue persists. I've done everything that i possibly can except for rebuilding the database and factory resetting the PS5. I am testing now to see if the issue still persists as I have just finished rebuilding the database, but was wondering if anyone could help out regarding this issue, as from my research no one else has this problem aside from me. Ive lost close to 100 hours of progress due to this and am wondering if anyone knows a fix. To sum it up my save data (console and cloud) for Elden Ring specifically is being randomly deleted, treating it as if I had never played the game before (it makes me re-accept the TOS at the start of the game, like you would when you first play it). Any help is greatly appreciated, as I am getting sick of trying to fix this issue when it never wants to work.\n\nEdit: Rebuilding the database didnt fix it. Im just going to factory reset my ps5 now",

When I connect this, everyone in the party has an echo but not only hears themselves but also the game sound (Fortnite lobby music). So if I now set the headset to almost completely quiet (so that I can hardly understand anything and can't hear the game) and also adjust the microphone level, the echo becomes quieter but never completely disappears. If I mute myself using the controller, my fellow players can still hear the game sound via the party chat. That was my problem. Then I thought I would try a cheap Bluetooth headset with an adapter. Suddenly everything works smoothly. I can make the game sound as loud as I want, change the microphone level as I want, all without echo. But if I connect the BT headset via cable, the same problems occur again. So my conclusion is it's not the headset. Now I would like to save myself having to get a new headset again.

Need help, don\u2019t understand what the problem could even be.\n\nI had no problems until a month or so ago when Black Myth Wukong started crashing on the hellscape Chapter without any warning\u2014 it began when I approached a specific toad boss and persisted throughout the chapter. It\u2019d shut down and give me an error message, then ask me to report it\u2014 which I did.\n\nI tried every trick in the book, barring a full reset. I tried safe mode options, deleting and redownloading, restarting the PS5, and even the rumored switch from vertical to horizontal. Nothing helped and I gained no insights on the true nature of my problem. Instead, I kept fighting the boss and eventually beat it Be for the game could crash. The next, and last, chapter of Wukong went without a single crash. I assumed it was isolated incident.\n\nThen I played Returnal, and it happened again. I wasn\u2019t too crazy about playing it, so it didn\u2019t bother me too much. Now I\u2019m playing Marvel Rivals and it\u2019s happening in this game too! At first it only crashed during the main menu and never during the game itself\u2014 but today it\u2019s progressed to 1-to-2 crashes per game.\n\nI don\u2019t even understand what the problem could be to work towards fixing it. Please help a brother out, cause I fear it\u2019s progressively getting worse. I don\u2019t want to do a full reset, but I will if it\u2019s a guaranteed solution.\n\nThe only possible clue I have is that my PS5 has been the victim of quite a few power outages while in rest mode. It\u2019s only been a year or slightly more since I\u2019ve bought it, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an internal dust problem\u2014 but I\u2019m willing to pry it open if someone else experienced this and solved it that way.\n\nTo be precise; my PS5 isn\u2019t crashing in terms of shutting off.

You can force every game to use HDR, which eliminates some flickering on game startup if you have an HDR-capable display but the game does not support HDR. One consequence is you can get some pretty gnarly color banding in unsupported games.\n* Forced VRR. You can force every game to use VRR, which forces every game to run at a minimum 48 FPS. This may break poorly programmed games that measure time by FPS, but this is not common.\n* Transfer rate. 99% of PS5 owners will never have to set this, but if you\u2019re part of the 1% with a particularly crappy display, then you may have to change this setting.\n* HDCP. Again, 99% of PS5 owners will never have to set this, but if you are one of the unfortunate owners of a 4K display that does not support HDCP 2.2 (and this is not common), then you either need to force HDCP 1.4 or disable HDCP entirely.

I did that and it worked great but I still want to do occasional gaming in my room while winding down before bed and lately I\u2019ve just been moving the PS5 back and forth and that\u2019s getting annoying so I\u2019m looking at buying another PS5 during this holiday season. \n\nNow from what I\u2019ve read while searching the sub, am I correct that I can have my account on both PS5s, I just wouldn\u2019t be able to be logged into both at the same time? So if I\u2019m downstairs gaming some COD or Marvel Rivals with friends and once we\u2019re done I want to go up to my bedroom and chill and play something else on the PS5 in my room there would be no issues?",

For example, I know you can stream to Twitch or Discord, but there\u2019s a solid \\~10s delay between what happens on TV vs on stream. \n\nA friend and I are trying to simulate a LAN party via FaceTime. Presently, this is nearly do-able in the FaceTime call by using the Remote Play app on the Mac, screen sharing this application, and using the presenter overlay. It looks great and has almost no lag as everything is going over the local network. This is the setup I\u2019m trying to replicate but still control the PS directly. \n\n  \nHowever, as soon as I try to directly control the PS5 with the controller / login to PS5 profile, the remote play stream ends. Obviously I would prefer to look at my TV while playing / controlling > Remote Play but again, Remote Play ends as soon as the controller connects to PS5. \n\nIf someone knows how to make this work via Remote Play, I am all ears, as it seems great minus the disconnect. Otherwise, I am open to alternative methods.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, thanks!",

My PS5 switches on. Then I play using the Remote App on my ipad. No problem.\n\nBut when we're home there's a slight issue of us switching the PS5 on every single time we wanna watch TV only. And when we switch off the tv the PS5 goes to rest mode.\n\nAlso, when I'm out of the house, and Smart Life messes up. There's a slight chance I don't even know if my TV switches on therefore I don't know if the PS5 is on so I do some trial and error stuff which takes so much time and makes me guess if any of the two are on.\n\nSo this is why I'm asking if anybody here knows if I can emit the same bluetooth signal of the ps5 controller ps button to switch on the ps5 without switching the tv on. (IR Transmitters can only do infrared so thats out of the picture) Thanks!\n\n\\*Right now I am checking if wireless gateways can work. If not. I might end up using those Smart Finger Bots that can press the PS5 ON Button on the console.",

Since the PS5 doesn't seem to support BT the headphones connect to my TV. The sound switches fine to the headphones and I have no problems unless I have to access the PS menus.\n\nFor example:\n\n* I press the PS menu to get to friends list\n* as soon as I do this, the sound switches from my BT headphones to the TV - the soundbar, oddly enough, remains muted\n\nIt is quite frustrating and I've tried a lot of different settings on my TV and PS, including unchecking things like allowing other devices to control them, etc.\n\nThe PS5 is connected directly to the TV, and the Soundbar is connected to the ARC input. I have it this way because the soundbar won't output at the higher refresh rate (which is the whole reason I got this TV). I can't recall the exact model of the TV but it's an LG EVO OLED 65\".\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and found a solution?\n\nI am thinking either:\n\n* Buy a BT dongle for my PS5 (any recommendations?) and try to connect the headphones there directly\n* Buy a new pair of headphones specific to PS5\n* Buy a wired pair of headphones/headset?\n\nI have confirmed the soundbar is the issue and the only way I've managed to stop it from messing things up is by unplugging it completely. Turning it off doesn't work because it seems to activate when I press the PS button as well even though they really shouldn't interact.",

Furthermore, none of my widgets are showing on my Home Screen and are all blank, regardless of WiFi setting. My speeds are perfect and stable, but it\u2019s just being weird. \n\nAlso, the ps app is no longer showing me my recently played games, claiming \u201cyou have played no games\u201d. I also cannot access the store as nothing loads on both the PS5 and PS App. \n\n\nIt\u2019s only an issue with the console and mobile app, my other devices work fine with everything else and the wifi is as normal. \n\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether or not this is a PSN issue, or an issue with my own wifi.

A friend of mine told me how his kids got him an Xbox 1 as a birthday gift, and now they have a scheduled time that him and his boys get on and plays together (they play Halo). I thought this was a good idea, so I got me the PS5. My son likes the idea as well.\n\nSo here is where I am, obviously, I'm going to get CoD and probably Fortnite. With CoD, do I need to match exact versions? If he has 5 and I have 6 will we be good? But does the hive have any other suggestions of good games, or more importantly, what all I need to get/subscribe to so we can get the biggest bag for our buck?\n\nDo we both need Playstation plus? Another type service? Once I get fully settled in the new house, I am going to set up the 2 networks so that my work home looks/acts like it is part of the home network (simple terms, VPN), so that is an option.\n\nThank you in advance for your help.",

My question is what is the point of having a disc, if i still have a massive download that i had to do to play it, and today when i popped the disc in nothing changed? is it just like a key that lets me play the already downloaded file? do i have extra things downloaded that i can delete since i have the disc which presumably should have some of that data stored on it? how does this all work?",

I was wondering if anyone had any clue for how to fix this, my guess is that it moved around too much in the luggage while the plane was moving and when they started tossing luggage onto those belts and it ended up messing with the internal parts but i dont see how that would really correlate to the console not wanting to connect to any sort of internet for more than a minute",

Should I stick with Linear PCM, or would DTS provide a noticeable improvement?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

When I check the connection status under Settings > Network it always says that I am connected to the internet and signed into my PlayStation Network account. However, whenever I start a game, for example FC25, BO6 or Marvel Rivals, I get an error message saying something along the lines of You must be connected to the internet to access the online features / Sign into your PS Network to access the online features / etc. And this happens everytime I start up a game. Eventually after trying for a couple times, the error message goes away and I am able to access the online features.\n\nI first thought maybe accessing the internet through wired LAN connection might help but it didn't. It is also not limited to a specific game.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what could be causing this issue and how to fix it?",

She simply doesn't have the patience.\n* Anything with a high learning curve to get started (this may include RPGs that take a lot of setting up)\n\n**2nd Tier Priorities**\n\n* My wife isn't usually into magic, scifi, fantasy. It's easier for her to get into stories that are mostly grounded. She ocassionally makes exceptions, but it's best when it's a light touch and not too heavy handed.\n* My wife tends to like mysteries, puzzles, murder mysteries, detective work, and above all, a really good story.\n\n**3rd Tier Priority**\n\n* I'd prefer it if the game isn't too dated, and perhaps even beautiful. I'm sure playing a beautiful game will be helpful in winning her over. But I know it'll help me stay by her side as she's playing through the game. Without beautiful graphics, I'm likely to check out sooner than later.",

I was playing last night and it was making it around every minute or two. It's not particularly loud or rapid, just a single click every little bit. It sounds very plastic-y, which probably ties into what I think the issue most likely is.\n\nI've looked into it a lot, and I did see a few other people mentioning a somewhat similar issue where they'd hear noises like that when turning the console off. Responses to those comments mentioned that it was normal and due to the plastic changing temperature, but I didn't see too many mentioning anything similar while the console was actually on.\n\nFor what it's worth, I do think I've heard it once or twice while turning the console off, and my room is pretty cold due to shaky heating at my place, so I could totally buy it simply being a temperature issue and the plastic expanding/contracting, but it's just hard not to be anxious about odd noises like that.",

For Minecraft, we had to make them their own guest(?) accounts with separate emails and all that in order for them to split screen. \n\nThe kids just got their own PS5 for Christmas. We are now wondering how the hell to set this up for them in the most cost effective way. They don\u2019t need their own paid PSN accounts yet, they can all share one account. But do we need to pay for another PSN sub?\n\nIdeally we\u2019d like for them to continue playing the games from my husband\u2019s console but my husband and I would like to play with them from that console sometimes too. \n\nI know that the console share thing exists but I guess I\u2019m confused on how it will work. Would it kick my husband off of his PS5 if they turned on their console? \n\nAnd Minecraft was already weird enough with having to make multiple accounts on the one console just to play together so now how does this work \ud83d\ude02\n\nThanks!",

Here\u2019s footage: [https://youtu.be/qddnMnGrbiY?si=4W5SOeZh5YX6ZF87](https://youtu.be/qddnMnGrbiY?si=4W5SOeZh5YX6ZF87)\n\ni\u2019ve tried the following-\ndifferent hdmi cord/port \nreinstall of DeS remake \nrestart console \nchange tv display settings/mode\ndelicate cleaning of the disc (before, between, and after reinstall) \ndidn\u2019t try a different monitor/tv but did try remote play to confirm that it\u2019s likely not a display issue since the glitching happened on my phone screen too. \n\nmost signs so far point towards a faulty gpu, but i\u2019m holding out hope that\u2019s not the case since there\u2019s no other artifacting, display errors, or any sort of abormalities outside of DeS. Menu is fine, my ps4 games are fine, don\u2019t own any other ps5 games to test but could try a free one from the ps store tomorrow (just wouldn\u2019t be a disc) \n\ni also saw someone in the demons souls subreddit who had the same issues in the same area basically 1:1, not very familiar with how gpus work/break but intuitively it feels unlikely that two would break in exactly the same way, so i\u2019m hoping there\u2019s an existing solution. but that\u2019s entirely based on my coping gut instinct. \n\nwould really appreciate any and all insight/help. have a fantastic day :)",

            "body": "First off, I'm in IT for a living, been a gamer for over 40 years, have many console systems up until the original Wii and PS2.   Have built and use PC gaming systems.  I understand how Parent & Child hierarchy accounts are *supposed* to work.\n\nI researched beforehand how multi-player would work.  It all pointed to how up to 4 players could play locally on the same system as well as online.   I purposely bought games that showed 1-4 local players and online optional.  \n\nThis is only letting 1 person play at a time. \n\n**SYSTEM:**\n\n1. I set up my main account.  Easy.\n\n2. I started setting up the kids accounts.  I didn't realize they all needed their own personal email addresses... so off to Gmail to make them.  In the PS5 account creation screens it said to use \"Your\" account but did not specify it was actually saying \"child\" account.  Somewhere in there I got their accounts entered, but QR coded (Passkey) to MY account.  That 100% hosed up accessing THEIR accounts!\n\n3. After what has been 2 days of setting this up, I have now managed to get their accounts un-hosed and the methodology should have been the same for each, but it was actually different.  No rhyme or reason.  Changing the account password seemed to be one of the key steps.   But the last child's still shows \"offline\" when I created the \"online\" account.   **UGH**\n\n**GAMES:**\n\n1. I need additional accounts via game websites to play them?  So for Fortnite, I need an Epic Games account for EACH login??   I entered my own and it connected like a breeze.  I then went to connect a child's account and it's all hosed up.  PS5's Authentication Code to connect the account to the console timed out (10 minute time limit), because it didn't tell me there were additional steps to include attaching a credit card to verify I'm an adult.  -- I cannot for the life of me get it to send a new Authentication Code.  The one that displays is Expired.\n\n2. Okay, so lets switch over to just playing locally, since online is hosed.  Can't do it.   The only option is to link a 2nd remote to the 1st remote.  **I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT!**  I want to connect 2+ remotes so we can play locally.  Even if it's just split screen for two!\n\nI have tried logging out all additional controllers. Log into the game.  Activate the 2nd controller... and... nothing.   I then logged in both controllers, entered the game... and... nothing.\n\nI swear this is a glorified single-player system.  Long gone are the days of a single system allowing up to 4 players to play locally and not online?????    At this point, I should just return it and get everyone their own gaming PC.\n\nOne friend said he made everyone \"adult\" accounts to bypass the messed up Parent/Child account fiasco.  And his son takes the PS5 and monitor to friends houses for gaming.  That reminds me of LAN gaming back in my day.\n\n**Takeaway / HELP:**\n\n1. How do I get each controller to be able to play together on the system with 1 screen?  This would be for like Madden Football, \"The Show\" baseball, FIFA Soccer, Fortnite, Fighting games.  It's a 65\" screen, so there's plenty of space.\n\n2. I'll try other kids accounts for Epic Games.  The sports ones want EA accounts.  I really don't want to create dozens of accounts for each gaming company to play their games.\n\nThis Parent / Child account stuff doesn't work right.  It's an obvious afterthought.\n\nThank you.",

He doesn't have an account so I've just been using the one time only guest mode, but have also seem I can apparently create an account for him on my Playstation without signing him up for a PSN? We're not playing online so would that be better than creating a family account?\n\nHowever, when he plays any game, the game just defaults to my controller settings (for instance, when playing NBA 2K, my settings utilize more advanced features while he'd just want to play a more simpler/button focused control). So is there a way to get his controller tied to specific controls/settings while mine is still at my usual settings?\n\nIs that possible with one time only/guest mode or would he actually need an account tied to that controller to save any sort of settings, like the offline account I also created without an email/online access tied to it?",

There were monsters/enemies for them to fight. It seemed like they had abilities or items that let them do things like run or jump around mid-air. I remember there being a big hammer the player used.\n\nThe graphics were good and it was open world. It was very colorful and had a light-hearted theme to me. It seemed to be multiplayer. I can't remember the name of this game for the life of me. I THINK it was announced at the same event/time as Pragmata and I can't seem to find the reveal trailer for it around the time Pragmata was revealed, if that's even an accurate time frame.\n\nAny ideas?",

Before he got the ps5 he used to play on a ps4 but on my psn account. \nWhen I set up the kids ps5 I did it using my own psn account, thinking I just keep my own ps5 the primary one. So that we could share ps+ and all the games I've already got in my library.\nThe problem starts here. When he played online on the ps4 and I on the ps5 at the same time it was no problem as long as we didnt play the same game.\nThats why I set up the new ps5 with my own ps account thinking this was still the case. Which it is not.\nI have now tried making my son his own psn account thinking I could just unlink his epic Games account from my ps account and then link it to his new one. But to do so I have to check some boxes and one of them says this: \"I will not be able to connect my Epic Games Account to another PlayStation\u2122Network account\"\nIm afraid to do this in case I won't be able to link it to any ps account ever again. \nI tried asking epic support for help but not got an answer yet.\nIf anyone have an experience with this please help me!",

A lot of the discussion online about whether it's worth it seems to be based on the screen/setup being used. So just wanted to get opinions here as well.\n\nI've currently got a QLED Samsung 75-inch QE75Q70RAT. It's a 4K Ultra HD TV, with HDR support and 120 Hz. It's only got HDMI 2.0 as opposed to HDMI 2.1 but not sure if this impacts anything significantly. I believe there is also VRR on this TV which helps.\n\nIn terms of finances, it's within my budget. Nonetheless, it's still an expensive purchase so just wanted to confirm if it would be worthwhile.\n\nAnd in terms of games, I mainly play single player RPG games and have quite a few games lined up which I'll be playing for the first time (GoW Ragnarok, Forbidden West, Elden Ring, Spiderman games, Baldur's Gate 3, Dragon Age Veilguard). I note some of them have PS5 Pro versions out already.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar level TV and was the change worth it/notable enough from your perspective to warrant the purchase?",

It is on wifi as the router is one floor above. I have been using wifi just fine for multiple years and yesterday I got a new tv. Well I connected my tv to the 5ghz network and then tried to use my ps5. Afterwards I was unable to make a connection. I thought maybe it was receiving interference from the tv so I tried connecting to 2.4 and eventually for testing turned tv wifi off completely. I just can\u2019t figure out why my ps5 will not connect to the 5ghz anymore. It says the signal is too weak yet it shows all the bars on the ps5? Nothing else changed. Ps5 is in exact same location. Please give any tips or advice to try. I\u2019ve restarted the router multiple times and attempting to change the channel of the router.",

Is there a way to install a second copy onto the console storage (or even beside the other install on the M.2)? \n\nThe reason for this is to work around a cap of 20GB for mod installation to ASA.  I regularly play on two heavily modded servers, and because the console cap for mods is so much lower than the PC cap, I have to play the musical mods game every time I want to switch servers and spend more time waiting for mods to install than I get to spend playing.\n\nI'm hoping to work around this by having two installations of ASA, one modded for one server and one modded for the other. However, I'm not finding a straightforward way to do this.  I'd heard it was a possibility for games with a PS4 and PS5 version, but ASA is PS5-only.\n\nIs this possible?  Alternately does anyone know if there's a way for me to increase the mod storage for ASA?  My console definitely has space to spare, but my understanding is that's an issue between Wildcard/Snail and the console manufacturers (and I haven't found a place to configure that by my own poking around).\n\nI guess this could be broadened for any game with similar restrictions, but right now my use case is ASA.\n\nThanks for your time!",

Also, I hope I'm posting this in the correct place. I've read all the rules about how to post, where to post, and what to read first, and I believe I've done this post correctly.\n\nSpecific behavior: I press the PS button on said controller to turn the PS5 on, the console beeps and turns on, the controller lights up blue & I see a screen that says *'To use your DualSense wireless controller, you need to update its device software to the latest version. This update will be quick, and your console won't need to restart. Connect your controller using the USB cable, and then select \\[Update Now\\]'.* There are two options available to me: 1) Turn Off Controller & 2) Update Now. I can use the controller, either wirelessly or with the cable plugged in, to switch between these two options. The Update Now option remains greyed out, even with the controller plugged in. A white box appears above Update Now saying '*To update, connect your controller using the USB cable'*. If I choose the option to turn off the controller, the controller turns off, and the light on the controller changes from blue to yellow. If I unplug the controller and plug it back in, the yellow light returns. \n\nDetails about the controller & cable: This is a controller I purchased alongside my launch day PS5 (disc drive model). It is NOT the one that came packaged with the system (that one still works fine), but I purchased it separately and it arrived with my console on launch day. It's an official Sony controller, came in its own box, and according to the box it didn't come with a charging cable. The charging cable I'm using is the one that came bundled with my PS5. The cable works properly with the other controller.\n\nWhat else have I tried: On my PC, I downloaded & installed the Playstation Accessories app. The install completed successfully, and provides me with instructions for two methods of connecting the controller to my PC: 1) Use the USB cable or 2) Use Bluetooth. My PC does not have Bluetooth, so I try option 1. With the controller plugged in, nothing registers in the Accessories app - it just stays on the page with instructions on how to connect.  \n\nI also checked settings in device manager to see if there was an old / corrupted device etc. but could not see anything of note.\n\nAnd finally, I went through the repair process on the Sony website by entering my device ID & model, but it says my warranty is expired and repair isn't an option.\n\nMy wife bought me It Takes Two for Christmas and we're unable to play - any help is much appreciated!",

Issue is temporarily resolved by having a fan blow are at the back, indicating heat issue. Console does not overheat and is clean as a whistle. \n\nI recently upgraded to a TV that supports 120hz. Since then I've been having problems with my Dual Sense Edge, Pulse Headset, and LAN connection disconnecting randomly. I've noticed though it only happens on games that tend to be graphic intensive. I can play Vampire Survivors all day with no issue but if I put on Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, it starts happening after an hour or so of playing. Same thing happens with Black Ops 6, but Red Dead 2 never has an issue. \n\nI first suspected that it may be putting out excessive heat. It's definitely putting out more heat than usual for these games,. Not enough to trigger a overheating message, which it has never done, but enough to interfere with some of the more sensitive components near the back vents. So I put a filterd box fan on it, focusing on the back, and the problem goes away. I've never cleaned the console so I took it apart and it was nearly Immaculate inside. All the heatsink vents were clear and the power supply intake holes were clear. \n\nIt's obviously a heat related issue, but I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do so I don't have to run a noisy fan every time I play those games.",

For the holiday, I inserted by Yakuza: Like a Dragon disc and it gave me the option of playing either my PS4 version or the free PS5 upgrade. They occupied two spots on the main screen, and the PS5 version was in the \"front.\"\n\nBut that stopped after the first problem occurred. \n\nMy original PS4 files were deleted because I didn't have enough space in my backup to migrate it to the PS5 when I bought it, so I just started over. No biggie, right? Well, since it was the protagonist's birthday I thought I'd try and go back to platinum the original version. The disc mounted, started the copy process, and when it was \"Ready to Play\" I started the game. I received an unspecified error message partway through Chapter 1, but I didn't think anything of it at the time. I figured it was just a hiccup with the latest patch.\n\nBut I wasn't.\n\nI finished Chapter 1, manually saved, exited the game, and discovered the game files were corrupted. Everything from the PS4 version was automatically deleted, including the copy and save game data, and now the PS5 won't even read the disc. It could before, so I'm assuming the alleged damage (it looks darn near immaculate) occurred within the drive, and it can still recognize enough of the game to let me run the PS5 version.\n\nI've inserted my other PS4 discs with PS5 upgrades, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla and Marvel's Spider-Man, and both only promote the PS4 version to the top of the queue. I don't know if this is software, hardware, or both. All I know is the help desk is swamped, and I can't get official support.",

I got a pair of pulse explorers to use with my portal and wanted to try them with movies as I don\u2019t alway feel like having the headset on if I have another option; effects sound great but dialogue sounds off and muddled.

I compared to a couple of other similar TVs (LG, Hisense, etc), and it seems roughly similar.\n\nI don't want to spend ~$1400 on a lemon, so I just want to get the temperature from this community on how much stock I should put in amazon reviews. I'd like to think it's a situation where only the angriest folks post these reviews, and the vast majority just coast along fine.\n\nFor whatever it's worth, I do not plan on using any of the smart features of the TV (I don't have cable and only use Plex and D+/Netflix/whatever through the PS5 itself), I just want it to be a big, dumb, pretty monitor.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Some other PS4 games are PS5-aware as well, they were patched to run/look better while playing on PS5 but they're not exactly native PS5 versions.

I fixed the issue, if you can call it fixing, was by just buying a much better TV that hasn't had any problems with any HDMI 2.1 related things.

I thought maybe it's a headset, so I bought the new Cloud Alpha III. I'm still having the issue. I tried out four different controllers including a new one. They all still have the same issue! Basically, what ends up happening is I can be trying to talk to my friends, and then all of a sudden either one minute or ten minutes later, they can't hear me anymore. I can hear, but mic stops working. The only solution has been to turn the controller off and one once or twice.\n\nThis has been really annoying and I have no idea for a solution. I am on PS5 Pro if that matters. Also sometimes after a few times of shutting the controller on and off, the PS5 then won't detect the controller anymore, and pops up with that Mouse and keyboard icon instead of a controller. I try using another controller to sign into my profile there to fix it, but it infinitely keeps glowing blue and I have to do a full system restart. I'm not sure if it's the system, the latest update, or what. I wasn't having these issues until the past week or two.\n\nDoes anyone know any solutions?",

Or because my account is set to Italy, will it always read as Italian code even if it's from a French version?\n\n(Also the French code seems to be compatible with an Italian account, because an Italian friend of mine redeemed the content with a French copy but in 2019, before the \"expiration date\")",

Realized it was the button itself when I figured out how to eject from the options. So the physical button itself won't eject, it beeps, but the eject function itself works and it accepts discs fine... Considering how difficult it is to find a damn disc drive right now... should I bother returning it? Is there a fix? I tried restarting my PS5, fully powering it off and on, even booted up in safe mode to try there and applied an update through safe mode, but the problem persists.\n\nHella annoyed, but at least thankful there's a workaround ejecting from the menu. I suppose I can live with this as I can't think of a scenario where I'd absolutely need to use the physical button, but it's certainly not ideal.\n\nEdit: a friend suggested I try a factory reset, and I even did it through safe mode just for the helluvit. Didn't fix the problem. Still ejects fine if I use the option method, but yeah that button just beeps and does nothing. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nedit 2: FIXED IT! Decided to try the ol' unplug it and plug it back in fix, popped off the cover and reinstalled the disk drive. Didn't seem like I really did anything and didn't expect much from it, but it works fine now! I'll leave this post up for anybody else with this issue googlin'.\n\nThanks Sony for making the first two hours experience with your $800 (disc drive + tax makes it a bit higher actually) videogame console such a delight. Ya really couldn't have released a disk version already setup for us, huh?\n\nWhatever.",

I was going to sell it but thought I'd wait until GTA 6 came out so looking at things to play until then. Am I aswell getting a VR set for it? I've only ever done VR at a local arcade once and played a cheesy zombie game but had a laugh. Is it less fun if you're not in a group of friends?

It seems PS5 slim is better cause of price and you still get the disc slot but didn\u2019t know if there was something absolutely remarkable about the pro. Also are there that many games that support Pro? I only have a couple of actual disc games so I\u2019m not too concerned about not having a disc but then I saw that you can play Blu-ray in the disc so that would save me a Blu-ray player. Anyway, is the slim good? Or is the Pro that much better to justify the cost? Thanks",

You need to get in touch with an actual human first off, support chat or whatever it's called. Be honest and nice. Your situation is pretty easy to understand if you explain it to them. If it's looking like they are not going to refund it mention you hearing that sony gives you a one time grace refund per account (which is true). And if THAT doesn't work then try again and get a different person. One time it took the 4th person to give me a refund. So don't give up if the 1st or 2nd etc says no.",

Unboxing looked pretty normal and had everything where it supposed to be but opening it further I noticed a couple scratch marks on the AC cord and also the charging cable. The console itself looks great no visible scratch marks or damages on the console or any near the plugins, but there is dust in the vents when you flash a light on. The employee did tell me it was brand new and kept assuring me to look at its round sticker seal, but ngl it was positioned so far to the left. \n\nSo yeah maybe I\u2019m just stupid or I\u2019m just nitpicking at things caused by my OCD but yeah any input would be great. Console works great no coil whines, a bit laggy sometimes in the home menu, maybe caused by the new update but other than all that it works great and smooth. So the scratch marks on the wires and the dust is what\u2019s making me think otherwise. Is this manufactured like this or is there a possibility I was given a used/open box mistakenly sold as new? Idk I just want something to be new if I paid my money yanno, my gut could be tellin lies but if anything I\u2019ll just return it for a peace of mind.

We\u2019ve really enjoyed playing the games mentioned earlier and she has a new fondness for fantasy adventure games (I get luckier the longer we\u2019re married it seems) and I want to strike whilst the irons hot. She\u2019s enjoying Diablo 4 atm, but I know the depth is lacking and it\u2019s just a magical version of dynasty warriors at this point. I considered introducing BG3, but that\u2019s a whole other level of complexity, yet the depth and story is something she\u2019d enjoy. She\u2019s aware of the style of play and combat and that\u2019s what puts her off, which is something struggled with myself. So I want to get into something before the boredom hits her. I wish games like Witcher or GOW were couch co-op because that would be right down her street. Any ideas folk? Much appreciated",

This monitor isn't popular, so there aren't a lot of guides out there. From my understanding it is the same panel as the 321URX however.\n\nI've seen HDR guides for PS5 where when adjusting it at a system level, you are supposed to go until you cannot see the sun and then go one more click further. However, it seems this applies only to TVs that have HGIG and/or DTM, neither of which are on this monitor. Does anyone here have experience with this?\n\nAlso, on a monitor system level, I am looking at HDR 400 and Peak 1000 to see which one is better. I've been told the 400 is closer to the artist's intention and the Peak1000 has issues with the MSI 321 brand. I do not have a way to update firmware, I am at 009.\n\nAnd finally, which Game or Professional Mode to use. I've seen many reports of using the \"User\" setting, but equally as many say the \"sRGB\" mode. I primarily play in HDR, so adjusting contrast, brightness, etc. is not possible with this monitor while in HDR. I also tried the \"Premium Color\" option, which looks better than both \"User\" and \"sRGB\", but it apparently over saturates the image. But when switching back to \"User\" or \"sRGB\", everything looks much more grey and dull.\n\nThank you for any and all help.",

It'll be personal preference for which you choose.\n\nAs far as HGIG, that simply automates the HDR calibration process, it doesn't have any effect on the actual requirements.  If you're calibrating manually, just follow the instructions (seems you found a decent guide).\n\nThat Rtings review also covers their suggested settings for gaming.  Generally, \"professional\" modes are about pushing color *accuracy* over vibrance.  Those are modes that you would typically use if you were a video or photo editor, or a cinephile who places a lot of importance on filmmaker's intent.

The only other option I can think of is sending the console off to be looked at but it\u2019s out of warranty. \n\nCurrently, if I\u2019m having a problem with a game, when it crashes, it usually shows error code ce-108255-1 or recently, says the game is corrupted.

The main factor when playing online is ping time, and that's a factor primarily determined by your location, and there's generally little to be done about it.  If you have a cheap, ISP-provided router, replacing it with something higher-end *might* help.\n\n> I also order an NVME SSD in hopes that helps? \n\nThe factory storage is already an SSD, and that only affects loading time, not input latency.\n\nCan you more clearly explain what the problem you're having is?

I\u2019m using an LG UltraGear 27GP850B monitor, which unfortunately doesn\u2019t have built-in speakers, so I rely on external ones. I have Logitech Z200 speakers, and while they sound fine in general, the way I have to connect them to my PS5 is far from ideal.\n\nIf I plug them into my monitor\u2019s 3.5mm jack, the audio quality is just awful\u2014super quiet and flat, like the monitor is limiting the signal. The only way I can get decent sound is by plugging the speakers directly into my DualSense controller, but that comes with its own problem: the cable. It\u2019s a thin, fragile cable, and after some time of moving around, it\u2019s already starting to cut out. I really don\u2019t want to rely on this setup because I feel like it\u2019s just a matter of time before the cable completely dies.\n\nI was wondering if getting a USB to 3.5mm adapter for the PS5 would be a good alternative. Has anyone tried this? Does it actually work on PS5, and is the audio quality any better than using the monitor\u2019s jack? Or is there maybe another way to connect the speakers without losing quality?\n\nIf anyone has other suggestions that could help, I\u2019d appreciate the advice.",

I have exhausted all possible other things I could have been failing to do.\n\nOtherwise absolutely nothing about it works at all except pressing TouchPad and it briefly flashes blue.  This is a controller I never dropped or broke, I took great care of it if you ignore the fact I didn't try to recharge it like i should have been.\n\nI bought a new ps5 controller battery.  I opened up the controller like a genius and perfectly swapped out the battery just like the video told me\n\nNEW BATTERY - Doesnt fix?! the issue!?  It still if I press TouchPad it briefly flashes blue\n\nIf I plug it in a long time with the updated battery it doesn't take a charge.\n\nOLD BATTERY IS THIS ONE, when I opened up the bricked controller this was the battery type  \n[https://www.ebay.ca/itm/266541519235](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/266541519235)\n\nNEW BATTERY IS THIS ONE  \n[https://www.amazon.ca/Controller-LIP1708-Replacement-PlayStation-DualSense/dp/B0DKP3BMVZ](https://www.amazon.ca/Controller-LIP1708-Replacement-PlayStation-DualSense/dp/B0DKP3BMVZ)  \n  \nI did end up buying a brand new controller and it works 1000% and I have been better about charging it and all is well.\n\nBut in retrospect I don't understand why my replace the battery mission didn't work.  I tried to see if the PS5 controller has a second battery or something but it doesn't\n\nI don't understand why swapping out the battery didn't fix my issue.  What is going on what did I do wrong",

I'm trying to link this 2nd YouTube channel to my PS5 so I can upload saved Fortnite videos on the PS5 directly to that 2nd YouTube channel.\n\nI've linked and unlinked my YouTube account several times to the PS5. It never gives me an option of choosing which of the 2 channels to connect to the PS5, only the account itself.\n\n Every time I post a Fortnite video from the PS5, it uploads to my personal/work channel and not the second channel. I've gone in YouTube itself and selected the 2nd channel as the default channel when YouTube is opened, then unlinked the YouTube account on the PS5, and then relinked it again. Still, PS5 Fortnite uploads go to my personal/work channel and not the gaming channel. I can still not find anywhere to select the correct channel to upload Fortnite videos to, and stop it from automatically going to my personal/work channel.\n\nDoes anyone know how to link a 2nd YouTube channel under the same YouTube account to PS5 in order to upload Fortnite videos selectively to that 2nd channel? It seems like there should be an easy way either by changing a setting in YouTube, PS5 or Fortnite, but I haven't been able to figure it out anywhere.\n\nThanks!!",

I\u2019ve spent 2 hours exclusively today and who knows how long over the few weeks I\u2019ve borrowed the old ps5 back trying to data transfer and waiting 2 days after the data transferring had finished only to see the game data hadn\u2019t transferred to my new ps5. Heck, I subscribed to ps+ because I\u2019ve heard this will 100% get the data back and still struggled because the cloud storage refused to upload Stardew and only gives me five options (HBO, An old Mozart game my grandpa bought, random stuff, etc.) out of the 30+ discs I\u2019ve bought and played on for years now. Any advice? I\u2019d like to figure this out before the old/original ps5 gets taken away and I have to restart on Stardew when I was on year 4.",

With uneven speeds tend to come other uneven aspects of the connection, such as jitter and packet loss. Here are some of the things you can do if you haven't already:\n\n1. Restart your router, might be as simple as that.\n2. If you're using wired try wireless to maybe see if there's something wrong with ethernet cable. If using wireless and you can try wired then try it. If using wireless and 5Ghz band wifi try 2.4, or vice versa.\n3. If you're using 4G/5G or satellite and you have the option for a wired method (Cable, fiber, perhaps even DSL) consider switching. Mobile connections are highly variable and for that reason they're not optimal for home internet use in many places. Cable can be variable too, hence my mention of its potential low quality, but usually tends to be much more stable. Fiber is extremely stable, and DSL is usually too.\n4.

Ubisoft and Square Enix, however, have either never had paid upgrades or they're extremely rare.

Here are the troubleshoot I have done, and I have watched about 100 YouTube videos to try and get this resolved. So about a year ago about my gen one ps5 started having connection problems with my headphones.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if I connected wired or wireless my friends could hear me, but I couldn\u2019t hear them or the game (when I switched the settings to have the game\u2019s audio funnel into my headphones now yes, I checked to make sure the ps5 setting was going to my headphones, made sure my headphones were up to date and I turned the volume of the headphones all the way up. Still nothing. I thought maybe it was my ps5, after I bought three different pairs of headphones, and all of them were having the same issue.\nSo October of 2024 I traded my gen one ps5 in for a ps5 slim and I bought new headphones the Artic Nova 5 for the ps5. Everything finally worked great no problems at all... until I needed a firmware update for my headphones and the dongle, no problems with the update, but NOW I\u2019m stuck on my original problem no audio whatsoever through the headphones when connected to the PS5 on the 2.4 mode with the headphones. I have spent the last few days again watch the same (pardon my French) FUCKING videos I have been watching, trying to fix the same fucking problem I have been dealing with for the past year. I\u2019m honestly hoping I don\u2019t have to pay for ANOTHER $100+ paid of headphones. Just to temporarily fix it. If anyone could PLEASE help me that would be amazing.",

At this point all of the outlets in my room (and other rooms in my apartment unit) went out. This happened a couple more times, but I was extremely excited to play the game so I flipped the breakers and kept playing. \nToday before playing again, I unplugged every other appliance I had in my room except for my console and monitor. I then played for about an hour and a half, then the same thing happened. All of the outlets went out. This hasn\u2019t happened with any other game that I\u2019ve tried playing so far on my console. \nI\u2019m very new to having a PS5, I\u2019ve only ever owned Nintendo consoles in the past. Obviously the power shorting out is not good for my PS5, so I decided to see if anyone has any advice or input? \nI live in an apartment with 3 other people. One of them has a PC setup.

They play offline, and do not have access to internet. \n\nEssentially, all of these PlayStations are the disc ones, so we are buying copious amounts of the same different titles/games. I haven\u2019t had a console since 360 and beginning of ps4 before the move to PC. Back then, I used to game share with a friend and essentially buy 1 game to be played across two different \nconsoles. My questions are: to not only be more efficient cost wise, and to not utilize staff time retrieving and switching out games. \n\nIs game share still an option? Therefore needing to purchase 1 game rather than 2. If possible, would both accounts need to be connected to internet to play these titles? \n\nCan we purchase these games online (connected to internet) and then disconnect from the Ethernet and still play offline?\n\nAre there parental controls that would disallow juveniles from changing the account information? (Assuming there is like 2FA that is connected to an email or something, so this probably wouldn\u2019t be an issue). \n\nTrying to create some efficiency and save some money for the agency. Any help or thoughts is appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

Something engaging and fun that will keep his interest and help him turn off his mind from work tasks. He's always a little happier when he has a video game he's working on.\n\nHistorically, he's loved Horizon, Assassin's Creed, Spider Man, and the various Star Wars games. He could not get into No Man's Sky so I'm thinking no open world. FPS games seem to be hit or miss- he enjoyed Fortnite when it first came out but hasn't really enjoyed others. On PC he enjoys RTS games but I'm trying to get him out of his office so he's not tempted to do more work.\n\nIf any games come to mind that you think may be up his alley, I'd appreciate it. I'm just trying to take care of him as well as he takes care of me but this is out of my wheelhouse. TIA for any suggestions!\"",

The first 20% of the game goes by quickly but then, the download gets excruciatingly slow and stops at 40/41% without fail. I tried to install it seven times total, and I'm losing my mind over this, lmao.\n\n\u2022 My disk is in pristine condition, has no scratches or anything, but I still tried to clean it multiple times for the benefit of the doubt, but it made no difference at all.\n\n\u2022 I have more than enough storage on my console ; I only have one game installed on here, which leaves me with over 700GB of free space. The game is less than 100GB, so it has all the room it needs to be downloaded on there.\n\n\u2022 I tried to download the game both WITH and WITHOUT internet connection, and I also tried to do an update of my PS5 system AND to rebuild the data base too. Again, no difference whatsoever. The download stops at 40%.\n\nThe game worked perfectly fine on PS4, so the disk in itself should be fine, yet it refuses to work. I went as far as trying to download another PS4 game on my PS5 to see if the issue may be from my console, but no, I was able to download RDR2 (which is even bigger in terms of storage) without facing troubles at all. Is it the possible for a game to just.. break and refuse to work despite it being fine before ? I am so confused, I just wanna play to my game.\n\nPlease, tell me there's a solution guys. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

But some PS3 games can be streamed to your PS5 if you have PS Plus Premium (and that is available in your country).\n* Games are not region-locked, but DLC and game saves are region-locked.\n* You cannot backup game saves to SD cards, except on PS4 games.\n* You cannot transfer your PSN ID to another region.\n* You can change your PSN ID; it will break a few legacy PS3 and PS4 games, but the vast majority of games will work fine.\n* It is very important that you turn on 2FA when making your PSN ID.",

I have 1GB down, 150MB up home connection also.\n\nHas anyone had success with AV over IP solutions on the PS5? Does the controller work either through the USB over IP inbuilt options in those boxes, or has anyone had luck with a USB bluetooth dongle and using their controller wirelessly in the second space? Have network cable running between the two buildings. \n\nBeen looking at something like these boxes from AV Access: [https://www.avaccess.com/eu/product-category/av-over-ip/](https://www.avaccess.com/eu/product-category/av-over-ip/)\n\nProblem: I want to be able to play the PS5 in a second location at home, which is way to far to hardware a HDMI and for bluetooth to reach from the console itself. Thought about just buying another console but PS5 doesnt seem to handle that too well either (I want to play off the same game data etc).\n\nFirst world problem I know, but hey its a fun one to fix!

All I can find are reviews praising it as a great PS5 headset, which is why I bought it in the first place.\n\nSo far:\n  -  It causes periodic interference with my controller.  This has happened regularly since the day I got the headset without fail, and with every controller I own.\n  -  The chat/game audio balance buttons don't work, but the PS5 interface tells me to adjust it with the headset buttons.\n  -  If I boot up the playstation and then connect the headset, the volume is terribly low, with no option to raise it (and believe me, I have looked extensively).  But if I turn the headset on first and then boot up the playstation, volume levels are fine.\n  -  If the headset connects while I have the mic boom in mute position, it will not unmute unless I reboot the headset and PS5 and reconnect them with the mic down.\n\n\nI'm trying to find out if there's something wrong with my headset. This seems so janky, especially for a Sony made headset that I've seen widely praised as a great option for the PS5.\n\nAt this point I'm just hoping that someone out there has had these same issues and can give me some kind of advice, as I would really hate to have to buy another headset after spending $130 on the H5.",

Anyone can play your games on your primary console by using a separate account. You (and only you) can play your games on the other console.\u00a0",

Games will often get disconnected from online services at random for no apparent reason, and connections to other players through things like PlayStation parties will also be interrupted, as well as connections to the party itself. Loading into many online game lobbies will result is connectivity drops or connection errors.\n\nOn Marvel Rivals i was able to gather that sometimes I will appear connected but have 0ms ping and 0 packet/data loss bith and and out, and be unable to interact with the game at all. On Warframe, I will regularly have my connection interrupted, and often get a warning that reads \"Strict NAT detected. NAT-PMP malfunctioning. Please forward UDP ports 4950 & 4955 to (IP address)\". \n\nI also have very notable issues in Smite 2, where oftentimes it will appear that I'm loaded into a lobby, but cannot select a character, similar to Marvel Rivals, and eventually I get booted to the main screen where I have to reconnect, and this can happen multiple times, as well as getting disconnected and booted to main after actively loading into a match or being on the load-in screen.\n\nThere's also a number of online games that I can't play at all, Payday 3 and the Monster Hunter Wilds beta come to mind immediately, often giving me instant connection error messages, and sometimes giving me errors like \"no playstation connection\".\n\nAny ideas on whats going on? Checked my modem settings and UPnP is on, and while I've been trying to get some ideas from digging around online, I'm kind of at a roadblock since I noticed that NAT Type 2 is the usual goal to reach, which is what I currently have, but things are still drastically struggling regardless.",

Anyway, talking purely about RPGs Starfield is basically confirmed to get a port sometime in the future, the recently released Avowed is unlikely to stay exclusive forever, Outer Worlds 2 is a confirmed simultaneous release across all platforms and Fable could very well be a multiplatform release as well.

Strangely, if I use Passtrough and watch a movie on HBO Max on the PS5 with Dolby Atmos, it works normally on the sound bar (each sound effect coming out of its respective speaker), only the games don't.\n\nEven testing on compatible games like Returnal, Forbbiden West, Spiderman 2. \n\nThank you for your help in advance!!",

Yet i get stutters quite bad ones on GT7. Is this a game specific issue? Because i only get it with GT7 other games including PS5 PRO enhanced games run fine.\n\nI have tried entering safe mode and clearing my cache etc it made no difference to GT7.\n\nI can remove the issue if i set it to non performance mode and set it to 120hz and which takes away ray tracing.\n\nAnyone heard of anything like this or how to resolve it? I am sure the PS5 PRO on default settings shouldn't be stuttering when the PS5 SLIM that i also own connected to another TV on quality settings does 60fps fine. Something is wrong with GT7 on my PS5 PRO and i have ruled out the TV an OLED Panasonic. Its working fine i tested it with my PC with a RTX 3070ti and it gave me no issues just like no other games on the PS5 PRO give me issues accept GT7 which is why i am at an impasse.\n\nIts just GT7.

I searched for a new TV for PS5 a few months before the console's release, and ended up choosing Samsung Q70T because it was one of the few decently affordable models that came with 2.1 support. That's how comparatively rare it was. In any case, feel free to check out your TV's specs on Sony's site: \n\nhttps://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xbr-75x950h/specifications\n\nAs you can see there's no mention of 2.1, and the panel's refresh rate is limited to 60hz. Regardless, Pro is likely a good fit for you because with 75 inches you'll really see how blurry some games are in performance mode, and if that bothers you then quality mode is your only option. If 30fps is fine for you then the base model is the preferable option, that's what I go with most of the time so I'm not the target audience for the console.",

I did not use the online account to play the games, only the offline profile.\n\nI purchased a PS5 for myself earlier last year, and have since been thinking of selling my old PS4. I would, however, like to continue accessing and playing my disc games with the saved progress I have already made on the PS4 via the PS5.\u00a0\n\nI am wondering if I could transfer the save data from my offline PS4 profile to my online PSN account that is already on that PS4 console. This same online PSN account is my primary account on my PS5 as well, where I intend to play the games.\u00a0\n\nIs it possible to link my offline profile to my PSN account (bearing in mind that the PSN account is already signed in on the same console)? Or should I attempt to download the files onto a USB storage device? I do have PS+ on my PSN account, so I will be able to transfer files between PS4 and PS5 on the same account.\n\nTo clear things up if there is any confusion: \n\nI had one profile that was not signed in to PSN, and the other was my father's until he gave it to me. Current situation: 2 accounts - account #1 is on the PS4 and is not signed in with an email or anything, only a profile. This is the account with the saves that I want to keep. Account #2 is a PSN account and is signed in on both the PS4 and PS5, and it is where I want to put the saves.\n\nIf anyone could please help me out, it would be greatly appreciated!",

            "body": "Everything is soloable, but I don't consider it to be a very good solo game. PvE portion of the game isn't too difficult, I might even call it fairly lenient, but PvP is something you'll run into eventually. When you do statistically there's a 66% chance you'll run into two or three other people, which instantly puts you at a massive disadvantage. Sure, if you're good at the game and the other party isn't then you could win even a 1v3, but I can't emphasize how much easier dealing with other players is when someone is controlling the ship while other(s) can focus on cannons, repairs, putting out fires, all that. When playing solo you'll have to handle everything yourself. That's pretty cumbersome even while not engaging in PvP.\n\nThere exists a game mode called safer seas which puts you alone in the world, but it's limited in terms of what you can do and the rewards. Playing it is not recommended unless you want to learn the game in a low-stakes environment. You can often try to avoid PvP by checking the map and your surroundings for other ships, but speaking from experience you can't avoid it forever. When shit does hit the fan having at least one other person on your ship helps massively.",

The next day the game appeared again, now at 253 hours. EA support said there were no logins into that game from my account. Anyone else experiences anything like that?",

We have a PS5 here in the gaming room. I believe that gaming is a good mind exercise and is included in the company's wellness program. I was wondering: \n\n1. What new multiplayer games to play for these wellness breaks of only 30 minutes? Can these games be saved? \n\n2. Can you also recommend mind boggling games and games that are engaging and fun?\n\nThe age range of agents are from 19 years old and above, and are all very open to gaming as some are already playing.\n\nAny recommendation will truly be of help.

Now it seems like that has been replaced with PS5 games, PS5 pro enhanced games, genres, and PS VR2. This apparently no longer gives me an option to view all PS4 and PS5 free to play games as when you filter this through all games and select the categories free to play and PS4 and PS5 games it only shows around 50 games and I know there are way more than that. Games like Fortnite and Apex do not show up filtering like this. Any tips here or am I missing something? I like to look through all free to play games when I'm getting bored of a game and it seems like this option has been taken out of the store. Can anyone else confirm I'm correct with this?

But still using the DualSense for gameplay of course. Is this possible to have both input modes running at the same time for this purpose? and only use the mouse and keyboard to let's say organise my inventory box and chat to people online?\n\n  \n2. I am struggling to find a nice wireless Bluetooth keyboard and mouse that are guaranteed to be compatible with the PS5 Pro. I don't want to use a cable or a USB receiver. Only Bluetooth if possible for a cleaner look.\n\nI am currently using the Logitech MX Keys for work which is very nice and supports multi-device.

Does anyone know a way to force open a browser that will allow me to type in the web address? Using my phone as hotspot won\u2019t work either as I\u2019m currently in the middle of the Atlantic. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

To avoid potential overheating, I pull it out of the cubby and onto a fold out table so that it's out \"in the open\" when playing. (The cubby is too cramped.) When I'm done, I put it in rest mode and turn it off, then put it back into the cubby to save space. The cords are long enough that I don't need to unplug anything while doing this. My question is: Is it okay to physically move the console while in Rest Mode? I would assume so, since it doesn't sound like the disc is spinning...But I just want to make sure. \n* Has anyone had issues with MK1 specifically taking forever to download? The game downloaded to a \"ready to play\" status very quickly, but at that point only a few fighters were unlocked. The \"full\" game still had an estimated \\~8 hours to download. That was nearly two days ago. There's still about 20 GB left to download, and the \"time remaining\" has said anywhere from 1 hour left to 68 hours left. I would consider this an internet problem, except for the fact that I downloaded *The Last of Us* and *Resident Evil 2* from the store (via my PS Plus subscription) and they finished downloading overnight while in Rest Mode. It seems MK1 won't even make any download progress while in rest mode. \n* Going back to my first point about having to pull the console out of the cubby to play then put it back in when I'm done - should I just consider getting a vertical stand and putting it next to my TV? That way I wouldn't have to be arsed with pulling it in/out constantly. My last console was X360, though, and back then there were a lot of valid fears about using your console vertically, despite Microsoft themselves saying it was fine. Are those fears no longer warranted these days? Is vertical completely safe?\n\nThank you!@",

However, there is one lad in the group who is a bit of a bully and likes to target my son, who is a bit \"soft\".\n\nLong story short, this boy will pick on my lad in order to get a rise out of him, then report my boy to Sony in an attempt to get him banned. He has successfully managed to get my boy banned from the network for 3 days previously. \n\nOn that occasion, it sounds like my son may have taken the bait and reacted to this boy, hence him losing his account for 3 days.\n\nThis is constantly ongoing and is a sore subject at present. My lad is afraid of me intervening or getting involved in fear of other escalations.\n\nThe result is my son now being afraid to play with his friends because this lad is often invited to the party, and my boy is afraid that the lad will keep reporting him for any little thing he does and get him banned again. \n\nMy boy really is a good kid, he's guilty of nothing much as such, other than taking this bully's bait on occasion. It is killing me to see him staying off his playstation and being full of anxiety for fear of this other kid causing him problems.\n\nWhat is the best solution in such circumstances? Obviously my lad wants to play with his friends, but this one boy is making that impossible. I've heard all of them swearing and having banter etc, and I know my own boy will swear on occasion, as I'm sure most groups of lads do. However, this kid doesn't report anyone else for doing anything, he literally just takes pleasure and seems to get a kick from bullying my son, and threatening to get him banned again.\n\nAny help or advice is massively appreciated!",

I've noticed that when booting up metal gear 1&2, the screen goes black, but then there is no picture, yet I can hear menu sounds (and the sound when you press the PS button).\n\nIn order to get the picture on, I have to cycle back and forth between HDMI channels on my TV 2 or 3 times.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has had a similar issue, and if it's just something the latest update has caused, or if it is a VRR issue, as I recently switched it on the other day?",

This causes the screen to flicker when you start a game.\n\nIf the video stream doesn\u2019t return, then either your display doesn\u2019t support the video stream from the PS5, or it has a problem where it doesn\u2019t correctly handle stream renegotiation for some reason (which is not common).",

Wired audio is still considered superior to Bluetooth?\n2. Optical audio is still considered the superior audio method (without a port, PS5s can only do this through a TVs optical out port)\n3. USB wired audio is considered second best?\n4. Natural Bluetooth would be third (but Sony only allows a handful of headphones to do this)\n5. Bluetooth dongle is fourth?\n6. And the controller port must be last (even though 3.5mm audio jacks are well regarded, the fact that it flows through a Bluetooth controller means audio quality suffers)?\n\nThis is a genuine ask for help - I\u2019m no expert.

I know performance-wise, they both perform the same and have the same specs. And yes, my new Slim has 1 TB while the fat one has 825 GB.\n\n\nBut I'm hearing some cons of the Slim compared to the OG such as:\n\n\n-Smaller heat sink and cooling fan\n\n\n-More heat exhaust/hotter exhaust\n\n\n-Louder than the OG console\n\n\n-The disc edition of the Slim forces you to have internet connection to register the disc drive. This is a one-time thing. However, presumably, if Sony stops supporting the PS5 Slim Disc Drive down the line with the PS6 and onward, would all my PS5 game discs be incapable to be played because the Disc Drive is now bricked once support is over? I've found varying answers to this question, saying both yes and no. I only want the disc version because I only play physical media and don't want my console to be a brick years from now if Sony pulls a plug. But if this is true with the Slim disc version, then this change is futile.\n\n\nShould I have just stuck with my OG console and return this new Slim while I still have the chance? Once I rid of my OG console, it'll be gone, and I won't be able to get it back, so I wanted to make sure I was going with the superior/right version here.",

You can have increased density in a smaller package that performs the same or even better.\n\n> More heat exhaust/hotter exhaust\n\n\"Hotter exhaust\" air is an indication of better cooling. It is removing more heat from the internals. That's... a good thing. Having said that, every unit will be different. \n\n> Louder than the OG console\n\nThere are 3 main sources of noise in consoles; the disc drive, the fan, and coil whine. Every unit will be different. There are some really noisy and loud original PS5s too. It's luck of the draw what components you get.\n\n> The disc edition of the Slim forces you to have internet connection to register the disc drive.\n\nThat's the trade-off for having a replaceable disc drive unit.\n\n> Should I have just stuck with my OG console and return this new Slim \n\nIt makes zero difference. They're both the same. Spending money going from a perfectly working original PS5 to slim does not make any logical sense. But the above are not the reasons why. You're worried about something in the far future that may, or may not, transpire and by then, the PS5 will be an unwanted $100 plastic box as the world moves on.",

My only real concern is the internet connection being required to play physical games. I still use my PS2 because I still have all of the discs and it runs them. I wouldn't want a console at any point that can't run the games I own for it, even if it's two or more decades down the line, so that, I do care about.\n\nAlso the Wii isn't even an unwanted $100 plastic box. Heck, nor the GameCube. Or N64. Those are still worth quite a pretty penny if you're trying to buy one today, so I highly doubt that of the PS5 unless we're half a century down the line.\n\nThe question is if the disc drive *WILL* be bricked once the PS5 loses support. Or if registering it just the one time enables it to work as a regular console forever. Still got varying answers on that, and I think that concrete answer would be the greatest determining factor for me.",

Ive had a few games deleted and unavailable to recover because of this and I need help with this problem. Is there any way of fixing the issue of my ps5 randomly shutting down as I clean it regularly and it still does it. I have recently discovered m.2 ssd storage for the ps5 and does solve the problem and does it also allow you to put any game onto it and still be able to play games off of it. Or is there any way of being able to fix my usb extended storage as I brought it years ago because it worked on my old xbox perfectly fine so I thought it would be the same for my play station.\nThanks for any help in the comments",

I'm also the \"primary\" account on the PS. My husband is the secondary profile, and does not have a PS+. In order to make sure his saves transfer to the Pro correctly, are we able to pay for a one month subscription just so he can have access to the cloud saves, then when we get the Pro we can download them directly to the console and then he no longer needs the PS+ account? And his save data will remain on the console? He lost a lot of save data when we moved from PS4 to 5 so we are both anxious about it.\n\nThank you!",

Just need to know if the method I originally described would work and the saves would be retained. \n\nAnd I'm not sure what benefits those would be, he can't even get the PS+ deals from the store or play any of the PS+ monthly games I've played unless he plays through my profile.

Maybe try this again but with it plugged in as well. It's been too long now to recall what all I did to fix them. You can maybe remove the controller profiles from the console as well, and repeat all this. Btw it's unclear why this even works because pair mode is for traditional Bluetooth devices and not ps5, as it uses its own version of Bluetooth. \n\nTo me I think it's a software issue, either in the console or controller firmware, and not faulty hardware.

Usually when I plug the headset into the wireless controller, the mic input setting will automatically switch from \u201cwireless controller\u201d to \u201cheadset (controller)\u201d. Because my headset doesn\u2019t have a mic, when mic is set to \u201cheadset\u201d like that, then there is no audio input detected. Occasionally, when I plug it in the mic input will stay as \u201cwireless controller\u201d and it is able to receive audio input using the controller mic. I can\u2019t manually change to \u201cwireless controller\u201d, because when it\u2019s set to \u201cheadset\u201d, only that \u201cheadset\u201d option will appear for mic input, and when it\u2019s set to \u201cwireless controller\u201d only that option appears for mic input. I\u2019ve never had both appear as options for me to toggle between in mic input. Has anyone else had this issue before and know a fix? Any help would be much appreciated!",

Instead it feels like the middle part is missing, so it goes straight in with some weird resistance and is not popping directly into the original position after being used. \nThis is only sometimes the case, like every 10th click or so, did anyone had a similar problem? \nIt\u2019s really weird when playing\u2026 :D",

Conventionally I'd just hook up my laptop to my monitor, and use my laptop's speakers, and that's fine, but I like that this is less hassle. However, when using the PS5 I feel like the audio\u2014particularly the dialogue\u2014is pretty weak, and after a pretty early point raising the volume doesn't seem to make any changes. I feel like the audio when gaming is fine, but not when watching media. I've fiddled around with all the audio settings, tried I think every combo that's applicable, but nothing makes it meaningfully better.\n\nI have a BenQ GW2283 monitor, and use its native speakers. I've used it with my Switch for four years and have always felt the audio was fine, but I haven't tried watching media through the Switch so I'm not sure if that comparison checks out all the way. Wondering about buying some cheap-ish speakers\u2014likely Creative Pebble, v1 or v2\u2014and hooking them up to the monitor, if that'll produce better audio all around for whatever I use it with. But I'd like to know if there's something with the PlayStation I should be aware of before investing in more hardware.",

It might be an overheating problem but I just have it on a table next to my tv. I\u2019ve heard rumors of the thermal paste from the cpu melting and falling on the motherboard board when it\u2019s vertical (which mine always is) but idk if that\u2019s true or not. If someone knows how to fix this please help it\u2019s gotten really annoying.",

I can\u2019t do anything with it because I cannot connect it to WiFi. I have xfinity internet. However it\u2019s for my business so the router is at my office. I DO NOT have a route at home.

I select xfinitywifi from the available networks, its automatically prompts the xfinity login screen to open, I login using my username and password, and viola. I\u2019m connected. However, as many of you already know. PS5 does not allow you to do that. Let me be perfectly clear on this, this is a PLAYSTATION issue. Not an xfinity issue. PlayStation has actively blocked ps5 users from connecting to xfinitywifi. All the old methods don\u2019t work. Sending a link in the messages doesn\u2019t work anymore. PlayStation blocks sending any links in messages now. Connecting to my phones hotspot first and then going from there doesn\u2019t work anymore. Using the linked account then YouTube to access the browser on ps5 doesn\u2019t work anymore. Every time a ps5 user finds a way to connect ps5 to xfinitywifi PlayStation then patches it so that method doesn\u2019t work anymore. This is 100% on PlayStation. I don\u2019t know what PlayStations beef is with xfinity. So how do I get this $450 paperweight connected to xfinitywifi so I can actually use the damn thing.

The ps5 was in great condition and I\u2019ve had it for around a year now and everything worked great. One day my little cousins were over and the hdmi wire was around their leg so when they moved the whole ps5 dropped. What ended up happening was the hdmi port stopped working, but the system still turned on. I called a few places around me to see if they can fix it but they were all charging around $200 and I decided it just wasn\u2019t worth it. I decided to list it online for $100 and I\u2019m not joking, around 100 people messaged me for it. I ended up selling the console for $100 and the two controllers for $40 each and made $180 back total. I wanted to buy a ps5 but I didn\u2019t want to spend $500 so I looked on marketplace and found a slim one for $350, I negotiated and got it to $315. I\u2019ve just got the ps5 yesterday and it looks really clean and works great, even the seller said it\u2019s nearly brand new. Now, I got curious to see how much others were selling a ps5 with a broken hdmi and everyone was selling it for $200-$250. And now I feel like I sold mine for way too cheap. Overall I\u2019m not really mad since I calculated I\u2019ve spent $485 in total for the 2 ps5\u2019s I\u2019ve had which is the price of a new one almost and the slim I have now is basically brand new looking. Just wanted to know if I sold it for too cheap because I know just because people list it for $200 doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what it\u2019s actually worth.",

Without the benefit of having tried them myself, my takeaway is that if I want richer bass (I do), go with Inzone. But there are other areas the Pulse seems to perform better in, including the mic AI that isolates sound to your voice and it has an EQ in the PS5 menu, whereas the Inzone sets do not.\n\nI don\u2019t travel with them, so the folding cups of the Inzones aren\u2019t a swaying factor. I don\u2019t have large ears so I\u2019m not concerned about the ear cup shape, either.

It keeps saying that I need to plug in the USB storage where the games were installed, but that drive no longer works.

I was assured that it was in working order and it came with an external fan and two controllers so I bought it. I got it home and I cannot for the LIFE of me get it to show up on my TV. I have swapped HDMI cords and powered off and tried to open safe mode. HDMI cables I tried work with other devices. HDMI Ports on TVs ( I tried it with 2 a Onn Roku and an older Samsung) are working with other devices. What else can I do? The pawn shop offered to look at it Monday but I just bought 2 new games today and I was really excited to play them. If it matters, the PS5 is the model with the disc drive and it has a stand that holds it in the vertical position. Please help, I'm pulling my hair out over here. I contacted Playstation Support over a half hour ago with no response. I have included the clearest pic I can get with my crappy phone of the HDMI port on the back of the unit if that helps.

My friend is game sharing with me and has few ps4 versions of some games which can be updated to the ps5 version for $10. I thought about sending him the money to upgrade his games but the question is if it\u2019s worth it to upgrade them. (considering most of them have a sequel that\u2019s already made for ps5) \n\nFor instance, I want to play through Spider-Man and miles before I get to Spider-Man 2. Before he started game sharing I only had Spider-Man 2 but have mostly been focusing the side quests because I knew I wanted to play the earlier games first to understand the story. \n\nHere are the games he has and the cost it would take to upgrade them:\n\nSpider-Man -> Spider-Man Remastered: $10\n(I have Spider-Man 2)\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn: $10\n(I have horizon forbidden west)\n\nLast of us Remastered (ps4 edition)-> Last of us part 1: $70 (unless it\u2019s on sale somewhere)\n\nLast of us 2 -> last of us 2 remastered: $10. \n\nAs it would be my first play through for these games, part of me feels like I should experience them in the best possible quality, but part of me also wants to avoid spending unnecessarily since I already have access to the games in some capacity. My idea was to just blaze through the story for games like Spider-Man so I can get back to Spider-Man 2. I feel like the biggest leap would be last of us as the ps4 remaster is from 2014 but I would have to pay full price to get the ps5 version of that game. \n\nSo is it worth it to upgrade? Will I get the most out of the game via the ps5 version? Should I just play through the story to get to the sequel? Or should I stop being cheap and just spend the $10 since I didn\u2019t have to spend anything on the game? Would love some opinions from people who have played these games in both original and remastered formats and would know best. Thanks in advance.",

I have some confusions in data transferring. I saw people saying if you transfer you ps4 save data from ps4 to ps5 with official transferring option, those saves can only be applied on ps4 version of games? And if you also transfer game data, then on ps5 those games will be ps4 version? But not the ps5 version? And if you download ps5 version of games from ps store, you can\u2019t use the ps4 version of saves that you just transferred, except some games made by Sony\u2019s studios? I also saw people said if you use ps+ to upload ps4 game save data to cloud, then you can still use these data on ps5 version of games after downloading them form cloud. Which of these are true? Huge thanks to anyone who wish to answer :)",

However, recently I started encountering some issues with my console randomly shutting off while playing certain games. It started when I first got  Hogwarts legacy a few months ago where I\u2019d be playing for a while and all of a sudden my console would just shut off without warning and wouldn\u2019t turn back on until I unplugged the power cord from the PS5 and plugged it back in. Initially thought it was an overheating issue and from research I bought the necessary materials to clean the dust out of the fan. Naturally there was a lot of dust initially given that I hadn\u2019t cleaned the fan before. Once I cleaned out the fan it ended up being okay however I\u2019ve recently purchased the Witcher 3 along with playing the suicide squad game that was free on ps plus this month and I\u2019m encountering the same issue again. After about an hour or two the console will shut off. Whats weird though is that this issue only happens with certain games. I play MLB the Show 24 quite regularly and I\u2019ve played that for hours and the console has never shut off on me along with Star Wars Jedi survivor and it never shut off either. I still clean the fan regularly so I\u2019m confused on what the issue is. Am I doing something wrong? Could it be a power issue? Would love to know more information if possible and sorry if this comment is so long",

I have read a previous post about this and have done all the steps it said to fix it. I have taken apart my PS5 and cleaned out the fans with compressed air, I have put it on its side, made sure it has a few inches of space in every direction, spent $40 to get brand new HDMI and power cords and nothing works. It makes the console unplayable, I have tried really hard to get into God of War Ragnarok and even though its a fantastic game I cant find joy in playing it because it crashes every 40-60 minutes. Also 2k and Fortnite are unplayable. Its also insane to me that you cant play PS5 games that are on your storage extender. The PS4 never had any of these problems. Im genuinely considering selling my PS5 because what good is it if it cant run the games I buy for it. Is the hardware just not good enough to play the games that were made for it? Is there any fix that has been found for this issue? Does anyone else suffer from this same problem?",

I have 1- PS5 (my personal device) in my office and recently purchased 1-PS5 (used- for my family) input living room.\n\nI have the same users on each device. \n\nI wanted to have different games on each device as my family and I play different games. The family room unit has family oriented games, the one in my office has mature games.\n\nI called in to tech support and they made me turn off my office PS5 as the primary and make the family room PS5 primary. They also requested adjustment to game sharing.\n\nWhen this occurred, my office PS5 now says I have to buy all the games. \n\nIs Sonys approach to consoles different than that of Microsoft? My buddy and I didn\u2019t even live in the same house and shared a family account for Xbox which allowed us to play the games simultaneously from different physical addresses when under different users that were apart of the same \u201cfamily\u201d.\n\nSomehow, Sony doesn\u2019t let two systems in the same exact address with the same exact users share games that we own?\n\nIs this right or did I just get bad support from Sony tech support?",

I thought there was an issue with the explore buds so I reset ( i dont even know what the reset does as it is officially stated it does not erase any connection or setting) both buds and the case. They were still connecting fine with my phone but the portal never connects. Even when i try to pair them again, the blue light flashes as it should, clicking the link button makes it as they are connecting and NOTHING! The case just turns itself off. Why is the cycle button on each bud when they still remain connected to my laptop and my phone but dc from the ps or the portal? There are major software issues with the link itself but sony never admitted it. I once reset my ps5 to stock just to make the stupid link work again. And this is a \"solution\" from sony support. Fix the link already! Also, where are the patch notes for the updates on both explore and elite?",

            "body": "Hey, so on feb 14 I bought my first ever PS (i bought it from sony store coz if something goes wrong i dont wanna contact amazon or anything since its too much work and mails and just a long process so deciding this, i went to the store and got it) , it was this dual controller, disk edition PS, so I was happy, took it home and when i opened it, there was just one controller, I thought maybe it'll be more inside but it wasnt and i immediately called the dealer from the sony store and told him the thing. he asked me if i recorded a video, i said i didnt since im no youtuber ( i didnt ever record videos but now i think i will ALWAYS do it) so i went to the store again told him the thing again in detail. Now he said \"lemme take it up, I'll mail the company and see what can be done, you chill and always make a video\"\n\nSo just wanted to know if any of you guys ever faced something like this or what should i do man? im clueless. I got one controller, i payed for 2, he (the dealer or you guys reading this might be thinking im lying) I dont know how should i act and what should i do. any advice and suggestion will be great.  \nthanks a ton in advance for taking the time out to help.",

I downloaded the game that came with it which was God of war Ragnarok over the next year. I then got three more games that were digital downloads for $86.97 each and they were the digital deluxe versions. Recently, I finally got tired of not being able to access the Sony PlayStation network due to \u201cthey\u2019re fixing the network\u201d I was also locked out of my account from approximately one to two months after getting it till last month so I finally said fuck it and reset my system I backed up all my games onto an external hard drive I made sure that all my games were associated with the one and only account I have ever had. I now no longer have access to any of the digitally downloaded games that I bought no longer have access to the old stuff that I had and now have to now re-download everything but the best part is anytime I try to re-download any of my digital games it says view product and then wants me to re-purchase it. I\u2019m really hoping someone else has had this problem too. I\u2019m at my wits end. I have called several dozen times trying to get my games back every time I tell them the one and only email address that\u2019s ever been associated with my account. They tell me that\u2019s not the right one. Please find the correct one and that\u2019s it on repeat every single time. No one wants to help me no one wants to give me a refund can anyone on here please tell me who I\u2019m supposed to call now if anyone has any idea on what I\u2019m supposed to do please help me out because this is several hundred dollars that I\u2019m now out. If you can tell me of a tech specialist who can get my games back or if you can tell me a number I\u2019m supposed to call that\u2019s not the standard 800-249-Sony (7669) number that\u2019d be great I\u2019m hoping that at the very least the gaming community can help.",

Charging a fortune on a controller thats built like crap. Worse part is that the USB port is soldered onto the main board on this one so no simple easy fix here. One it's gone your controller is as good as dead and time to get another one as the board itself will cost you 50 bucks. Maybe this is Sony's way to get people to spend more money on their controllers. What good marketing strategy \ud83d\ude44....",

But the catch is ofcourse that you will be paying for something you do not own. After 2 years you might have paid 300 dollar and they will offer the console you were using to you for another 300. Then you paid 600 for a 450 dollar console. Or you decline and paid 300 for the use of one but have no console at the end. Besides that, you will have to pay for damages and theft if it occurs unless you also buy insurance against that with Raylo.\n\nIf you are aware of these downsides and still \nthink it's worth it, go for it.",

Any decent PS5 exclusives that fit the bill? Not really looking for COD, I've had my fill of those. \n\nI feel like every time I see a trailer for an upcoming game for the console, it's either a sci-i or fantasy RPG, a rogue-like dungeon crawler, 3rd person adventure, or some other button masher. Can't remember the last time I was excited for a game on this console....\n\nAny suggestions greatly appreciated!!!!",

For example, let's say a game x has received a patch for running it with 60 fps with 4 Pro visuals on PS5. Will the game run with base PS4 settings, patched settings with supersample or base visuals with 60 fps?",

Recently played Spiderman on my friend\u2019s PS and Got addicted to it, there are other titles too like Infamous Second Son, God of war and all which I\u2019m interested in.\nNow I\u2019m thinking of making a switch to PS5, I\u2019m getting a used one for around CAD $500-520. But I bid in an auction without reading the terms for a PS5 pro for $560 ( thinking I would just have to pay13% tax on top) which would be a great deal.  But they are gonna charge me 16% more as fees for auction and I can\u2019t back off from that too.\nSo I wanted to ask will it be a good deal for CAD $740?\nIs it worth CAD 250 more than Ps5?",

I disabled MLO and that resolved it. I have a PS5 Pro as well and that didn't have any issues but I guess that's because it supports Wifi 7 natively.",

I have two questions about it 1 is it worth it for someone who mainly wants to use it for the Life Is strange and lost records games and whatever else by Dont nod that releases and 2 like with some other devices from some companys can sony take away my ability to use it once they stop selling it like can they disable the remote play feature or will that most likely stay on there after they discontinue it?",

Worst case scenario is they stop making updates for the software, which doesnt mean it will stop doing its basic function.\n\nAs if its worth it... you want to pay $200 just to play some 5hrs games... and thats it? Why not just play them straight on the console? What benefit does the portal ACTUALLY give you, cause you didnt list any?",

Like the college football and WWE series but also rocket league. Played PS4 Spiderman and that was pretty good.\n\nMy two most favorite games are GTA V and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
