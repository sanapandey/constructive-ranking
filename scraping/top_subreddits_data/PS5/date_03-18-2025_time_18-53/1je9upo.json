Here is an excerpt describing what was behind the \"too much water\" line in the pros & cons section:\n\n>It\u2019s not a new complaint, but Hoenn is still imbalanced type-wise, heavily favoring water. It\u2019s especially noticeable in Alpha Sapphire, in which Team Aqua (the villains of the piece) use a lot of water types. It feels like there are water Pok\u00e9mon in nearly every battle, and I have an overleveled Pikachu to show for it. You also have to navigate many bodies of water, since much of the late-game involves the HMs Surf and Dive to get from place to place. Diving was really neat back in 2002 when it was new, but I found it incredibly tedious in Alpha and Omega \u2014 an obvious example of how superfluous some HMs are.\n\nAnd\n\n>Everything in Hoenn, water or not, is either delightfully cute or strikingly beautiful, and I enjoyed seeing the entire region anew \u2014 despite the tediousness associated with navigating all that pretty water.\n\n>Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pok\u00e9mon and often dull navigation of their habitats.\u00a0\n\nThe \"too much water\" was just a silly sentence in the review breakdown at the end.  Their whole pros and cons section was always terrible and people focused too much on these simple sentence breakdowns instead of the body of the review so it's good that they stopped doing them.  Anyone who read the review would understand what was behind the comment, but IGN should have known even then that people just look at the score and quick summary.\n\nSource:  \n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/18/pokemon-alpha-sapphire-and-omega-ruby-review\n\nEdit: To be clear, I'm not suggesting the review itself is good or bad, just stating the reviewer does explain why they feel the game has \"too much water\".  It could still be poor criticism without that little blurb at the end.",

One is a lazy slider toggle to boost/lower enemy HP and defence in the case of difficulty levels. The other is designing the game to reward those who explore more to get that sword to make the game easier for themselves.\n\nIn other words, if you struggle in Dark Souls, you can go out of your way to spend more time exploring and improving yourself (i.e. preparing) to conquer a difficult foe. Difficulty levels instantly resolve the issue while careful game design provides a proper sense of reward for exploration to overcome a difficult challenge.\n\nYou can't say these two methods are the same just because they both pertain to adjusting difficulty. They are clearly very different approaches that require different time investment and levels of thinking from the player, and ultimately different gameplay experiences.",

And a lot of it is meant to be funny to Japanese people not westerners, I'm not Japanese so I just don't engage with it.

I like infinite wealth, I actually thought it was far better than mainline games and ichiban felt way better than kiryu.\n\nBut people say assassins creed is the same game over and over again but to me that\u2019s exactly what yakuza is. From 0 to 6 it\u2019s the same game with the same map with the same gameplay loop just different melodramatic story with cutscenes that need fucking intermissions because of how long it is. Atleast Kojima cut scenes makes no sense so it\u2019s somehow gripping to see where it\u2019s going. These games are so predictable. And then after cutscene you walk down the same alleyways the same city with new neon lights and there will be a bunch of goons to beat here and there. Gimme a break bro. \n\nThat\u2019s why I said atleast like a dragon series goes outside the comfort zone by doing something\u2019s different. But at the end of the day it\u2019s the same goofy game with some boo hoo cry for me storyline. \n\nAnd when I talk about the weird voice acting I mean the classic Japanese In game dialogue where characters will stand and hmmm and mmmmhh and make grunting noises while a typewriter will jot down what the player is thinking or saying. It\u2019s a thing in Zelda games as well. It annoys me cause either give me full cutscenes or give me player character that doesn\u2019t speak, what is this half assed don\u2019t speak or speak shit going on.",

The Yakuza series has pumped out annual entries that are all similar in terms of look, gameplay and often even sharing entire maps and mini games.\n\nAnd there's certainly a risk of people getting tired of it to the same degree as Assassin's Creed and other Ubisoft games.\n\nBut at least as of now I think the writers and game designers for Yakuza / Like a Dragon bring more character to their games and arguably focus more on the fun factor. This probably limits their audience somewhat (afaik their sales figures aren't anywhere near Assassin's Creed) but also they are way more efficient, putting out essentially the same amount of content for just a fraction of the development cost.\n\nE.g. compare Skull and Bones from Ubisoft to Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii from RGG.

I just don\u2019t think that if the games would have been released by a Japanese Developer, it would be seen different as these problems would be still apparent. My point was that nobody complains about formulaic design; people complain if this design repeats the same weaknesses without improvements.",

User reviews are now utterly useless and only serve terminally online users who have been convinced by YouTubers and other dumb influencers on what the hot new thing to be outraged is. If it's not that, it's often a tired attempt at humour. Finding a genuine user review has become next to impossible now and the averages have lost all meaning. Established critics generally get it right overall.\n\nBefore you try and say \"paid for reviews\" or \"bribed\", this has been the ridiculous accusation since forever and it's hilariously never been proved right.",

After that, AC black flag is a must play imo (just wait for the upcoming remaster at this point), and then play AC Origins. I feel like they really missed an opportunity with Origins, it should have been their next reoccurring protagonist with their own trilogy.\n\nAC shadows probably won't be as bad as people will make it sound on the internet, but I don't think it'll be anything remarkable, especially if you have been exposed to ubisoft's gameplay formula. I say, wait for it to be on sale.",
