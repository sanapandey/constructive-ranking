I think a big difference with Yakuza is a hardcore fan base and the devs knowing how to keep the fans happy, even with drastic changes like the Ichiban turn based RPGs. With Saints Row, the fan base, especially on Reddit thinks that they should have made Saints Row 2 Part 2 and anything else was the worst thing in history. There was no pleasing everyone, and they kept trying to please everyone up to the reboot that pulled a Rise Of Skywalker and pleased nobody.",

Of course that's his opinion, so, take that how you may. My guess is that it's faster because you don't have to create things from scratch just import it into the new project.",

The Third established that not only did people want a giant open world, but they wanted a lot of freedom in terms of how you could navigate that world. And on top of that there needs to be lots of chaos and explosions. With Yakuza you have areas that are very small compared to pretty much any open world. There's also very little interactivity with that world, and your freedom of movement is also very limited.\n\nThere's really no way to make a game like Saints Row at this point without it being quite expensive. It's why city-based open world games have slowly faded away outside of GTA.",

Honestly I get that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the game \u2018being fun\u2019, I think it\u2019s more about the landscape of the market that those specific games exist in right now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that companies all of a sudden stopped making open world GTA clones in the last 10/15 years.\n\nLike if it costs 500 million and 5+ years to make a GTA clone that\u2019s competent and that people will consider fun that\u2019s not really a good investment when the yardstick for comparison is GTA which is probably going to cost in the billions to make",

The famous cardboard box Snake hides in are labeled with specific areas of the game so you can hide in it in the back of a truck to get delivered there as a form of fast travel.  In MGS2 you can do chin ups to level up your grip to hang off railings for longer periods. I could go on all day. \n\nSo much creativity you just don\u2019t really see in new games anymore.  With the vast majority of games you know exactly what you\u2019re getting. No big surprises anymore.  \n\nIndie games and passion projects still deliver. Im mostly talking big budget AAA type games",

Now that there's a full TWELVE year gap between GTA games, assuming GTAVI even releases this year, gamers absolutely are interested in GTA-likes.\n\nBut they have to be actually good. And good doesn't mean as pretty and expensive as possible - I couldn't personally give two shits about how state of the art the visuals are if the game isn't fun.\n\nI think the fact that the AAA gaming industry is run by MBAs who barely know what a video is means it's an industry that learns about itself very, very slowly, and often doesn't take the right lessons away from its own failures.\n\nEvery single gaming executive should also be a gamer - change my mind!",

And of course artificially expanding the open world, while it's quality is stale.   \n  \nNot saying it's not important but I clearly see priorities are shifted towards less important things to keep open worlds exciting. They do literally anything but actual actual sandbox elements in gamedesign that could generate rich gameplay loops. \n\nI can't say R\\* themselves are trying into sandbox gameplay much but they are passionate about different complex systems and simulations that eventually can generate custom mini-scenarios. Flora & Fauna logic in RDR2 was amazing, I spent so much time just roaming and getting into different situations while main missions were overly linear. GTA can still generate fun moments with cops and different NPC behaviors. \n\nFrom other studios that can't afford complex simulations such as R\\*\u2014 I'd expect expect at least actual sandbox mechanics, more interactive level-designs and most-importantly \u2014 interconnected events and seamless gameplay choices. It sounds complicated but it's still times more efficient than trying into expensive movie-game with pointless, dead and static open world just for the sake of the open world. \n\nIt feels like industry is full of old-men who are overly romanticizing movie-approach in videogames and it makes them blind. Again, I love stories, good cut-scenes, overall visuals and staging but first things first, please...",

Also, barely any people on the streets\n\nThe best part about the older Saints Row games was causing chaos, killing everyone, exploding cars, get into chases. Saints Row was the more explosive and action packed game compared to GTA. Saints Row 2022 was just boring\n\nThe gameplay has some good ideas (a finisher that replenishes health, for example) but the gameplay has barely evolved from Saints Row The Third, so there is no reason to pick 2022 over The Third Remastered. At least that game has a ton of fun action and activities\n\nAnd this is just the broad strokes. There is a ton of detail missing as well that was present in the other games. Why can't I rob the stores like I could in every single game before? \n\nI don't understand how a game so half-baked could be that expensive to warrant that comment from Saber's CEO",
