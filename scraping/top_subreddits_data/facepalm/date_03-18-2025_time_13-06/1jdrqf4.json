But early on, asbestos got a bad rap because of the fact that miners who were digging asbestos for many years would often develop asbestosis, and therefore people thought that asbestos was not safe. I'm not saying it's the greatest material to work with. I'm only saying it's the safest material in terms of fire. A huge and concerted effort was made to have asbestos removed from buildings, causing tremendous dislocation and destruction and creating a new problem: asbestos floating in the air.\n\nI believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented. Millions of truckloads of this incredible fireproofing material were taken to special \u201cdump sites\u201d because of this stupid law.\u201d\n\n-The Art of the Comeback (1997)\n\nFuck me.",

He also has AO exposure, and survived prostate cancer from that, and has a bunch of other stuff it caused, so how the heck he's made it to 82 with all of his health conditions is totally beyond me. . I'm guessing probably the cabinet full of meds the VA has given him. His diet is awful too because he ignores everyone. I even set him up with meals on wheels, bought him a vacuum sealer and an air fryer/convection oven thing, and after the novelty wore off, he reverted to his cheap, awful microwave meals. I just stopped trying...\n\n\nETA: My uncle worked at the same place and died of lung cancer.",

After the lockdowns were relaxed, factories went right back to filling the skies with smog and blotting out the stars again. The yellow river is filled with waste, garbage, and chemicals making it a toxic slurry.\n\nMuch like their attitude towards their people, the Chinese government does not care about the environment. Hell just look at how they\u2019ve been leveling the environment to artificially expand cities with more and more empty and unused apartment building that either crumble due to shitty and rushed construction, or when the government knocks them down within a decade.",

China is transitioning at a staggering pace to full electrification with huge amounts of renewables to provide that power. And that makes sense given renewables are quite significantly cheaper and don\u2019t produce huge amounts of horrible smog. China was expected to reach peak carbon output in 2030 but they\u2019ve actually brought that forward so that the peak happened last year and from here on renewables and electricity will become increasingly significant for their already high base in China.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly one of the main reasons why trump\u2019s insistence on going for coal and ICE vehicles makes very little sense. The tech to do it cheaper and better without those exists, by raising tariffs and ignoring not focusing on that tech the US will at some point take down the trade barriers and find itself in a world in which it no longer has a competitive advantage in several huge industries.",

It's literally the same coal that was pulled out of the ground 100 years ago. It hasn't been treated with any special substance. It hasn't been magically processed. It's a lump of carbon, and when it's burnt it dumps CO\u00b2 and ash into the atmosphere. It's the same as it ever was.

Coal is dirty because it's been filtering the water as it goes through the rock layers and settles into our aquifers. Keeping coal where it is gives us clean ground water. Especially with all of the other pollutants we let get into our water we could really use that filtration. Cole being left in the ground has tremendous value. \n\nAlso, fun fact about Coal, All Coal came from a period in history after plants evolved Woody stems but before any microbes evolved to be able to digest it very well. So for millions of years Woody trees and bushes just died and piled up and got buried and turned into coal. \n\nWith this means is that we can essentially never make coal again. It's a great resource. It was specially captured and sequestered carbon and energy from the Sun from a particular time in history that can never happen again and no problem with us using it initially. But if we don't use this gift to transition ourselves to renewable energy sources It will be the biggest mistake we could ever make",

People were sick, people died.   \n\nThis was caused by coal fired plants in West Virginia.  Eventually laws were passed so that states could sue other states. and they forced those plant to use scrubbers and eventually many closed.    \n\nWe rarely have red alert days.  IIRC the only ones I remember recently were due to wildfires when the wind was blowing the right way.  There are summers we don't have any.  It was wildly successful for our health.",
