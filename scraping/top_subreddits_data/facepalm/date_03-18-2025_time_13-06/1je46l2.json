Not to mention your religion isn't backed by anything but faith, which is fine but it means nothing is proven. Trans people have empirical data that backs their identity and why they deserve the same treatment about their gender as any cis person.

Liberals get upset at people trying to oppress others and discredit the experiences of minorities.\n\n\"Transwomen are not women\" is reasonable to get mad at, as it is quite literally saying, \"I do not respect or acknowledge your sense of self, and I think I have more say in who you are than you do\". That is not at all equal to Trump erasing all mentions of the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb used on a civilian population because its name contained the word \"gay\", even though it was literally just the name of a human being and had nothing to do with homosexuality.\n\nTrying to make those out to be equal just shows that you don't really care about what the actual issues are that are being discussed. You're just playing tone police. Yes, people freaking out and getting angry is very rarely helpful for proper political discussion, but sometimes, there is reason to be angry.
