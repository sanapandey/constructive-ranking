Since it didn't come to light much later, its likely he lied on his citizenship application regarding school etc for his visa status.

I've seen it so many time in the town I live in - one of the most affluent in the country. A number of years ago they were after our town council to build a tennis club and it was almost approved before all hell broke lose. They backed away from it but some of the people asking for it were absolutely loaded. They could have all got together and funded most of it themselves for the community but crickets, not a peep. A few years later the town was looking for $5M for their portion of funding for a new arena. Because the provincial government wouldn't give it to them, they decided to visit some of the well heeled of the town looking for financial participation to help raise the $5M. They got a \"no thanks\" from every fucking one of them. My last example - our church was far too small for a growing bedroom community and decided to build a new one. The Priest who I had known since I was a kid was pastor. At one point during the fund raising I had occasion to have a lunch with him and asked how the fund raising was going. \"Those who can afford to give the least, give the most and those who can afford to give the most, give the least\" he said in complete frustration.",

There is so much dirt in the Dems side as I think most aware and level headed people can see. \n\nBut \n\nThe Dems aren\u2019t stacking district, federal and State courts at an alarming rate.  And at least haven\u2019t been gerrymandering the ever living shit out of districts for voting and not submitting redistricting in time for elections. I mean just in North Carolina. They were told back in 2014 to resubmit their zones.  They still haven\u2019t come to a conclusion!!  \n\nIt\u2019s so wild.  They have had Democratic Governors ever since but Roy Cooper never held control of state government. Even now the new Governor is a Dem and The Senate is Republican run and only 1 vote shy on the house side. \n\nLike wtf?!   I\u2019ve tried to figure it out. But my only two conclusions are. 1. People don\u2019t vote for their representatives and mostly only for Governors. And 2. People don\u2019t vote straight tickets. Which with the two party system here we stand\n\nMy apologies Grumpy for my Ramble but to wrap it around. You are right. Democrats have down nothing to bring up younger leaders. Only when they need a vote to show the masses right before a presidential election but they still stick with the establishment. \n\nTheir base has shown they don\u2019t want that.  People have become apathetic by not voting or caring. As seen by over a third of registered or could be voters just not voting or even becoming so disenfranchised to vote the other party line. \n\nAnd even then. Chances to shove shit down or to block future things has never happened.  Too many deals. Too much money in pockets. \n\nThey have done themselves no favors and they have alienated millennials and future Generations as of now. Weak as hell. \n\nIf you call out someone lying. Stand on it. Hammer them down for it. Don\u2019t just use it as a sound bite for the day and forget it. \n\nI hate to be negative but I don\u2019t see a way we get control back and even then. The courts will be too far gone. If we do it will be a one and done to try to fix economics but will be roadblocked and blamed by media, politicians, corporations and voting citizens.  \n\nThe best thing I really hope for moral reasons is that hopefully Democrats have just been asleep at the wheel (I know that still sounds bad but). And That they weren\u2019t too greedy, over confident, or ultimately uncaring because of ignorance and not knowing what was happening on the ground floor for their populace. \n\nBut the current leadership seems so blindsided by all of this. I don\u2019t understand how they could be after 2016. Even in 2016. It was evident in many areas across the nation. \n\nIdk. Maybe it\u2019s where I lived from NC to Florida. But even some family in Canada. A ton of people believe in what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s because of weak leadership and honestly at a certain point you have to go into the trenches as well. This high road at least publicly ain\u2019t working. \n\nNew strong younger transparent leadership must be established. This ain\u2019t working\n\nAgain. Thanks for listening if you read that ramble. I\u2019m just tired and frustrated but I don\u2019t see any good way out unless getting back to grass roots and fighting it out.",

The point was that when he golfs, the detail has to stay at the hotel where he stays. They get charged too stay, he charges them over the odds, so his own hotel makes maximum money. \n\nI don't know if that's true, but it's Trump so it could be. The issue wouldn't be that he had detail (after all, he's had two attempts on his life) but that tax payers are literally paying for him to hold at his own resort, and for his detail to stay there, and he makes that money for himself. Repeatedly. He takes no pay cheques, but has been given over 20 million fir golfing in tax payers money, a great deal of which he makes back as payments to the course and hotel. He's made easy more than a presidents salary already.\n\nSo his claim that a detail for two people who his own mob have threatened before us waterfall so needs to be cancelled immediately, holds no water when he's causing so much extra expenditure in order to benefit himself",

A Paul Simon documentary told the story of making the album 'Graceland' which Paul Simon recorded in South Africa with black South African people. There was crazy upheaval about this move because South Africa had been flagged as a state for the US not to associate with because of apartheid. At least, so they said, because this was unheard of. Don't forget that at the same time we had the Live Aid concert and 'We Are The World' by USA for Africa. While well-meant, it was clear that South Africa and Africa as a whole were never again given a chance to be seen as a driver of cultural or technological advancements, and instead had to be 'saved by the good will and fortune of America'.

(Yes- even more so than the United States\u2019s version).\n\nSo please attack Biden for being a rusty old fart if you want to, but leave South Africa out of it.
