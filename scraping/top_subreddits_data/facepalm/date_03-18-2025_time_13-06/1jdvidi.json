I imagine regulations play a big role, and I know those are gonna go out the window but still isn't it FULLY unobtainable to just spin up a power plant in like 3 years?\n\nEdit: did some googling it's like 10 years with regulations 4-7 of that is construction, and we produce only 2 million short tons more than we use in a year. Considering a powerplant will use 3 mil in a year ya have to add onto that time to beef up coal production facilities. He won't be able to get a single one built before 2029, even if he slashes regulations out the ass.\n\nEdit again for more information on how coal focused is insane: you can spin up a solar farm in 8-18 months. While a wind farm takes the 10 ish years with regulations, construction is only 18 months. EVEN natural gas (which would still allow him to line the pockets of the fossil fuel industry) ONLY takes like 3 years from start to finish. WHY COAL?!?!",
