                            "body": "Another French author worth reading after hundreds of years is Jean Jacques Rousseau. He wrote 'Du contrat social' in 1762. Basically he explains how a society works and how being a member of a society is like having a contract with the other members to support and defend each other. As soon as a member is attacking another member, he is not covered by the contract anymore and can't use it as an argument to defend himself.\n\nI think this is particulary relevant today as we ear more and more people saying that 'leftists are the most intolerant people' because they don't tolerate other 'opinions' (said opinions being racism, homophobia,..). Jean Jacques Rousseau figured it ou in 1762, not tolerating the intolerable isn't intolerance.\n\nThe saying is true. History will repeat himself if people don't learn from it.",
