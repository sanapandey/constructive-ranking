These sort of close bonds meant that problems got resolved more peacefully, things like theft were less likely because you would essentially quarreling with or stealing from someone who was a most distant a friend of a friend of friend. \n\nFrom what we can tell there is at least some sociological, neurological and historical truth to this idea\u2026 that in no way means there is a limit to empathy\u2026 beyond the fact that in the above scenarios most people never encountered anyone outside their group, it\u2019s says nothing about our ability to empathize which is a neurological, cognitive function, in which we use our imaginations, experience and sensory information to \u201csee\u201d a situation for the perspective of another, encompassing cultural, emotional, intellectual factors in an attempt to understand the the psychological and emotional experience of another\u2026..\n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m explaining all this here, most people don\u2019t need an explanation of empathy I\u2019m just so frustrated these days with morons being well morons when we have so much information available.",

            "body": "Ok so he\u2019s \u201cnever physically hurt anyone\u201d but he\u2019s also a deadly threat?? Make up your mind, Musk! Saying you\u2019re a deadly threat to normal US citizens is such a fucking horrific thing to say, especially if you hold a position of any power. He has been laying down the rhetorical groundwork for genocide, direct and indirect. \n\nThe truth is, the things Musk and the rest of this administration have done will already kill so many people globally and domestically even only looking at infectious disease related cuts and changes. The indirect genocide has already begun. This administration will have the blood of millions on their hands in the span of a year (I\u2019m not going to formally cite a source for this because I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m an epidemiologist and I work in infectious disease).\n\nThe thing is? Domestically, these infectious disease deaths are less likely to affect people with \u201cthe woke mind parasite\u201d first, as Musk and co. are generally using that terminology to refer to people like me- educated, empathetic and left-leaning. Often, that group trusts science, lives above the poverty line, and better has the ability to isolate during disease outbreak. The only major thing that works against us there is that we tend to live in more densely populated areas where person-to-person disease spread is a bigger risk. \n\nBut the people the infectious disease related policies will kill first domestically? We\u2019re already seeing the beginnings of that. Deeply red areas with low vaccination rates. Many of those areas are full of people who rely on safety net programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and/or Social Security- all programs that are under direct threat from this administration. \n\nInfectious disease is often most likely to kill children and the elderly, along with medically vulnerable adults. Ultimately, without effective public health, accessible healthcare, etc, we are all at risk from infectious disease, so yes, Musk is a deadly threat to people like me and my family, and perhaps arrogantly unknowingly, people like himself. But first, he\u2019s a deadly threat to the very people who have empowered this administration, the very people who say they support his actions. \n\nAnd I take no joy in saying that, in fact, us \u201cwoke\u201d public health and healthcare workers are going to do everything we possibly can to contain this mess, to save lives, so reduce future impact. All on an even more limited budget than usual, all without the solidity of federal public health infrastructure, and all while being actively villainized by Musk and his associates for having basic human empathy. This is a fucking nightmare of Musk\u2019s creation and he is a deadly threat to every single one of us, and for the end goal of what? For him to get richer? For him to have more power? That\u2019s why people fucking hate him.",
