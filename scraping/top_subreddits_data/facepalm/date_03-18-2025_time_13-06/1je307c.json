So for all these years we've had the perfect anti-immigration anthem, yet it's impossible to use for evil purposes.\n\nEDIT: On second thought, I never was able to figure out if it was just about poor people on welfare, or if it was about immigrants, seeing as the most common trope was how immigrants had large families. But quite possibly I was wrong to put it that way.",
