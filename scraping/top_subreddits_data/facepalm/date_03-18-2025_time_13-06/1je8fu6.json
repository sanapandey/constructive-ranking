This is not a defense of elon in any way people can do whatever they want with their money and their cars. \n\nBut this is absolutely worse for the environment. The initial production of an EV pollutes multiple times more than an equivalent class gas car. Now as time goes on. The gas car starts to pollute more than the EVs initial environmental impact. The study I saw showed the break even point being around 30k miles. However that was with an EV with what is a relatively small battery for the US market. Size it up to larger EVs and youre likely talking about 60 to 80+ thousand miles before the break even point happens. And if you live some place like west Virginia where the majority of the power grid comes from dirty sources then that break even point gets stretched yet further into the 100+k miles range. \n\nNow 100k miles for a car is middle age. The car still has plenty of life. So the net result over the life of the vehicle is still a drastic reduction in emissions. But that does not mean that the car does not pollute at all. It just doesn't do it directly through its tail pipe but it absolutely has a pretty sizable environmental impact. Just less than a gas car to varying degrees. \n\nSo in the long run, comparing EV vs gas. Ev wins. But now double the EVs environmental impact by buying 2 of them. And youd have to own the second EV for longer than the life span of an average car of any kind in order to simply reach that break even point. And by then odds are shes bought yet another car.\n\nSo you at best have no better environmental impact than a gas car. Or at worst actually have a worse environmental impact by doubling the carbon footprint of EVs youve owned unnecessarily.",
