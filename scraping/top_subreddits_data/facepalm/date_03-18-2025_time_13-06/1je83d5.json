He never had policies. They were illegal. Europe sucks. They are illegal too. Europe is totally illegal and I am going to deport all of them. \n\nThe USA has lost the plot. I am of the belief that Americans are indoctrinated from a young age ( made to say the pledge of allegiance in school. Made to sing the National anthem at every mundane event etc.\\] and now they are torn about doing what is right and fear of being called a traitor.\n\nAmerica was founded in a rebellion against what they saw as tyranny. I hope to fuck you find that courage once again.",
