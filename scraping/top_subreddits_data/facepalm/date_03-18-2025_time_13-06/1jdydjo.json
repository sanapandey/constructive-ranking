Does that summarise things accurately? \n\nWhat percentage, I wonder, of universities\u2019 enrolment is from overseas? Will it make an impact on their bottom line, because this matters since everything in that country is a corporation.",

It's worth less than a bowling trophy.\n\nActual degrees have specific criteria laid out to earn one, and Columbia charges a TON of tuition to earn one. I fully expect people to sue for their tuition back if the university actually takes back their degrees.\n\nThis is a 275 year old university (it is older than the United States) throwing away their name to pander to a guy who can't legally be president for more than 3.75 more years.",

At most. It's terrible that they died but your statement is sensationalist given that in general the Israelis are almost completely safe right now and are able to continue their lives without any significant material change. Can you say the same about the Palestinians?\n\nAnd is destroying Hamas currently improving the lot of the Gazans? >60,000 civilians have died just to strikes, and we're physically unable to count how many have died to famine because there's no functioning authority within the city with the ability to take a census, even if they had the will for it.\n\nAnd Israel trying to stop Palestinian civilian casualties is becoming harder to believe by day frankly. I bought it 2 weeks into the war, but it just doesn't seem to fit IDF actions and it also doesn't fit Israeli political rhetoric.",

In response we received a vague reply from your office, which seemed to reference a completely different topic. Rather than standing up for the Columbia community, the University\u2019s leadership has stood by or, worse, accelerated and enabled these threats,\u201d the body wrote.\n\n\nColumbia University authorities this week warned students at the institution\u2019s journalism school about posting on social media, according to reporting by The New York Times. Non-US citizens were especially warned to avoid publishing about Gaza or Ukraine.\n\n\n\u201cIf you have a social media page, make sure it is not filled with commentary on the Middle East,\u201d the journalism school\u2019s dean, Jelani Cobb told students. \u201cNobody can protect you \u2026 these are dangerous times,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\u201cHistory shows that a university that does not advocate for the academic freedom of its own members is opening itself to further attacks on academic freedom in the future,\u201d said historian Eraldo Souza dos Santos, who is currently affiliated with Cornell University.\n\n\n\u201cColumbia seemingly not only ignored Khalil\u2019s calls for protection, but also has been willing to collaborate with the current administration in its efforts to criminalise dissent on campus.\n\n\n\u201cIt should, instead, be trying, within its own capacities, to offer legal and public-facing support to a generation of students who belong to the same long struggle against segregation and apartheid that took shape between the 1960s and 1980s,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.",

So if you don't value the things you learned I see no reason why the school can't say that they don't want you representing them. Now is that enough for them to take your degree that you paid them for away, I'm not sure. \n\nBut either way both sides of this are just dumb. If you support the Palestinian people and are against the actual actions being done by the Israelis that's fine. If you support Hamas and proclaim that Israel is committing genocide you are supporting an international terror organization and spewing misinformation. There's a big difference between those two things.",
