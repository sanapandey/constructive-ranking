You clearly massively misunderstand it.\n\nThe point of the second amendment was to create a militia system based on that of Switzerland, at a time when the US did not have a standing army. The founders thought an armed populace could be in place of an army. Purely as a defensive force. As it is today in Switzerland and back then.\n\nI mean read it in this context and it is immensely clear \n\n\u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nThat is not saying to withstand tyranny within, it is simply a call for a national militia which is a defensive force in lieu of a standing army. Like Switzerland. (I mention Switzerland because this wording is specifically taken from the Swiss militia system. It was the direct influence on the founders)\n\nBut then America became an imperial nation and set its sights on expansion. It created a standing army, and that army became the largest the world has ever seen.\n\nThis whole \u201csecond amendment is for tyranny\u201d thing originated from gun lobbyist groups in the 70s. And is perpetuated by the same idiots that elected Trump. It\u2019s not the intention of the second amendment at all.\n\nAnd if you think a military won\u2019t follow orders to kill citizens, I suggest you open a history book.\n\nAnd I said very specifically and outright I\u2019m not against violent uprising. I\u2019m actually a dual citizen, American and Irish. Suffice it to say I know a thing or two about armed resistance and support it. And with that knowledge in mind I am telling you the worst possible moment to engage in a campaign is right now.\n\nThere is not enough preparedness for an actual rising, and it would massively embolden the republicans in power to start rounding people up en masse. It would result in a blood bath for us and a stronger Trump. A fruitless endeavour.",

Those countries survive the way they do because of their communities, They don't use tech like us (specifically the WAY we use it, they do have tech) to socialize, and they have the ability to survive without specifically earning too much because they can augement survival with labor. \n\nThey tend to have close knit families all living near each other, so if something affects 1 affects all and they get all of their politcal/ policy/ community views from there. \n\nThey don't get the mixed messages we do by our continuous use of tech, and likely receive support for what they feel when they get the message withing their own communities. \n\nLastly, longstanding \"poor\" communities tend to have built in family roles and structures to help each other out. Grandma makes huge soup weekly for all the neighborhood kids, Cousin while unemployed does chores for the nearby families in exchange for meals and such. And if those fail they can try to still grow small gardens or have impromptu farmlands as a community or rather hunt without much oversight. There is still poverty crime like stealing and starvation but these communities experience that regularly. \n\nThey have cause to demonstrate because the US is seen as a bastion of ideals and democracy around the world, and if that falls, lots of hope will be lost. \n\nWe are struggling to tell our families this due to our culture, find truth because of all the mixed messages, and organize because our like minded individuals aren't nearby all the while, our jobs are the only things keeping us alive in the food desert cities we've created. \n\nWe are going to have to get creative to solve this problem, we need as many people to see this as we can get.\n\nEdited for typos.
