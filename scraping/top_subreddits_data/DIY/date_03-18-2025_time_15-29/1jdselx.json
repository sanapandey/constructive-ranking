This would cause my box cutter blade to dull quickly and from time to time give me splinters when not wearing gloves. It's real easy to cut though, just hard on the blades.\n\nSo I recommend wearing the recommended PPE: gloves, protective glasses and any kind of mask.\n\nBe careful when installing it as it will break if you fold it too much.\n\nThe results are great, and it's fireproof and moisture resistant.
