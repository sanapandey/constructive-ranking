    "selftext": "Bought my first flat and, in a moment of feeling broke but full of hope decided to refinish my floors myself, with the help of my brother. Suffered a weekend of hss hire machines but ran out of time to do the proper lecol and wood dust filler in the kitchen which meads sanding. I've filled with Ronseal natural wood filler instead, but it has come out white! \n\nShort of scraping it out and starting again, is there any product I can try to paint/colour over the filler to get a better colour match to the pine floorboards? I was thinking a wood crayon, or even painting varnish down the strips and putting fine wood dust on top before varnishing the floors.  \n\nI may otherwise just varnish and try and sort this out in the future. I'm moving in this weekend and a kitchen would be really useful \ud83e\udd23\n\nAny tips or advice much appreciated! ",

It would be a mistake to put down the sealant IMO, because then there's really no \"sorting it out\" in the future. Short of stripping the sealer.",
