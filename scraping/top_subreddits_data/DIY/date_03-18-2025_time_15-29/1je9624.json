    "selftext": "Hey all. moved into our place and the air return grill was missing in the kitchen. it appears to previously have had one but looks like it was just screwed into the drywall. I measured the vent opening and it is 12\" x 8\". I am looking at buying a grill cover and I see the vent screws that come with it our 2\" in length. I measured from the ceiling to the holes on the vent and it looks like it is is around 2.25\" deep (presume someone got lazy and this is why the previous cover was screwed into the ceiling. When i search for vent screws, I only see results that 2\" in length. Do they make longer ones? If not, is there a screw with a similar profile that I can use instead?",

Those should be available in any hardware store, possibly even with painted heads.\n\nThe exact type of head/screwdriver style isn't important as long as you have the right wrench or driver.",

When we did the inspection, the cover was missing but was told it was just taken off because they were having the vents cleaned, but when we moved in it was nowhere to be found. \n\nI guess I can buy the vent cover in store, rip out the screws, and see if they have any longer ones. Love the idea on the color, will help if I find screws that are not white. Thanks!",
