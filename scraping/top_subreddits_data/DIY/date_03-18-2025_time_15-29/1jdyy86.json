    "selftext": "I recently tore out my patio and discovered many sections of rotting fascia board. One section didnt even have flashing. \n\nContractors want an arm and a leg to remove and replace. \n\nMy question is how hard would it be for me to just pry the rotting fascia out and install new 2x6 by nailing it in then prime and paint? Is there anything else i would need to do? \n\nI also noticed there seems to be more than one layer of wood behind the fascia board. Was that there just to extend the depth of the fascia (to create a fake eave overhang)?",
