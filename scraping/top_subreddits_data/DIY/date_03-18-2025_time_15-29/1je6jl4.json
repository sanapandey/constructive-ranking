    "selftext": "\nI have a slate bench in my shower that is supported by 3 steel \u201cL\u201d bars about 1/2\u201d thick. They\u2019ve begun to rust pretty bad, and drip brown water onto the shower floor with some small rust shards. I want to clean off the existing rust and then somehow seal the bars to prevent from re-occurring.  The bars are not visible so the finished product doesn\u2019t need to be pretty, just effective. Ideas?",

Prep is a big deal, clean them well and wipe down with alcohol.\n\nI have steel lintels over all of my windows (1930's brick house), and wire-brushing them followed by Rustoleum and then exterior house paint has held up for close to 2 decades.",
