After the drywall was in all of the outlets are  about 1/2 inch to deep. \n\nPics: https://imgur.com/a/CILJPF9 first pic is of outlet all the way screwed in, second pic is one I have adjusted to correct length. \n\nI know there's that black washer thing you can use to adjust depth on the outlet screw but I adjusted it and it still seems to wobly for my taste. How do I fix this?? There's about 9 outlets in total like this. \n\nThanks for your help!!\n\nBTW, yes I do know a piece of plastic is stuck in the second outlet pic. ",
