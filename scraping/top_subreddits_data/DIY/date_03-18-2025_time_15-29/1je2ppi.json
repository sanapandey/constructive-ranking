    "selftext": "I plan to bury my sump pump discharge pipe from my house to a storm drain type thing in the rear of my backyard. One of my neighbors has there sump pump running there too.\n\nThe distance is about 40 ft roughly. I live in Midwest.\nThere is already a decent slope from my house to the drain.\nI plan on using PVC schedule 40 4 inch pipe the entire 40 feet.\n\nThe pipe will be sloped a good amount.\n\nI'll install a freeze guard at source of discharge.\nHow deep should I bury? Is below freeze line really necessary if I have a big slope.\n\nDo I need to lay a gravel at bottom of trench before placing pipe in? Or does that not matter? Any thing else you would recommend? Should I use something other than pvc schedule 40? Anything else I should think of?\n\nThis is a sketch of my idea. Thanks for any input.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/iYHWw9m\n",

            "body": "You need to dig least 18 inches so you have adequate soil to grow grass. Maybe more if you have an uneven slope. It\u2019s more you you think. If you add a little gravel under the bottom will help level it out. You don\u2019t need to add a lot of gravel unless you want to do a perforated pipe for drainage. \n\nFor this project last year I used the black singlewall solid drainage pipe from Home Depot within 20 feet of the house then switched to the perforated pipe. I used this because it could bend and my run wasn\u2019t a straight line. It was also a little cheaper than pvc. But I\u2019m sure your plan will work if you have a straight line that runs to daylight.",

            "body": "You should bury it at least 2' to the top of the pipe, bedded in crushed rock with 1\" foam board on top. Obviously if it is deeper the better. Anything deeper than 3' is probably overkill for this. Although 4\" pvc seem overkill for a sump pump discharge to me. That's a lot of water. Most around me are 2\" lines at max.",

            "body": "I ran my sump pump discharge (2\" PVC)  all the way up to the basement ceiling, then angled it down from there, out through the wall, laterally to the corner of the house where it enters 4\" PVC via one of those funky 4\" elbows with a 2\" inlet on the side; that 4\" catches rain water from about 1/3 of my roof.  From there, the 4\" runs another 20 feet or so into a storm drain.  The 2\" pipe is only a couple inches underground where it comes out through the wall, and a foot or so where it joins the 4\", dropping another 12-18\" from there to the storm drain.  Because it is downhill from that point high on the basement wall all the way to the storm drain, it  drains completely all the way back to that high point well inside the house.  I don't have a lot of water going out, but it has never had any problems.\n\nI have another 4\" PVC carrying rain water from the other 2/3 of my house.  Because reasons, it starts out only 4\" underground,  and  gradually drops 10\" over 80 feet to join up with the first one right outside the storm drain.  I cut out established sod, buried the pipe, and put the same sod back in - and it grows just fine. Northern Pennsylvania, FWIW.",

You could add gravel and perforated pipe (a second run) if you also wanted to improve soil drainage in that area. \n\nThe good part of using pvc is that it\u2019s strong enough to be snaked, so put a wye or tee someplace convenient so you can flush it or snake it if needed.",
