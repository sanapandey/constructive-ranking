    "selftext": "Hello all, I'm in the middle of finishing my attic, approximately 250 sq ft as framed. \n\nI'm in the Chicago land area and I'm thinking about the need for a vapor barrier between the insulation and the drywall. The exposed area below the angled walls (left 4 ft, right 3ft) is insulated, but will not be drywalled. We have vent chutes in every bay between the soffit and the upper unfinished part (\"new attic\") and the roof is well ventilated.\n\nIf needed, why and what's the best way given the layout?",

Feels weird to not put the beams behind the vapor barrier, but also Im not from the US and not really familiar with climate or code/ regulations.\n\nIn Sweden the go-to is to put unfaced insulation in the bays, vapor barriers that covers everything and overlaps 15cm with taped seams. And then some 45x45mm wood across where you run your wires and also add 45mm more insulation.\n\nHere you dont put vapor barrier at all and have clean beams for drywall or sheets. \n\nWith the added benifit that you dont puncture the barrier when hanging stuff on the wall!",

Yes, checked multiple times from the original drawings, structural engineer, and multiple experienced professionals (e.g., GC, roofers, framers) and we determined that there were two I beams to support the weight in the walls underneath (garage) and spanningthe floor, one you could see in the original. We added collar ties on each rafter to support the top and 3/4 OSB to tie the bottom together to prevent the walls from bowing out, which was the main concern that I heard. The pony wall also adds additional support. \n\nAlso a big part of the original feedback was folks thought they were seeing 2x4 when they were looking at 2x8 and 2x10. We ripped the 2x4 to bring the 2x8 to 2x10 levels and put OSB on top\n\nWhat are you seeing that's concerning you?",

This is gonna mold like crazy if you don\u2019t. \n\nEither way, I\u2019d definitely suggest a smart vapor barrier like an Intello or Siga to help mitigate vapor issues.",
