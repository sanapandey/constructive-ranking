    "selftext": "Enjoy these before, during and after pictures of our backyard process!\n\nMy wife and I bought our first house in the fall of last year. Shortly after, a hurricane took 2 large trees down to the point where we had to basically demo the old fence and grind the stump up ruining the whole yard. \n\nFrom there we put up the new fence ourselves, had a company install gutters (the only thing we had someone else do), ran gutter drainage underground out to the road, built new shed, put rock/pavers/fireplace in, built raised beds, installed sod, and today we just finished the flower beds.\n\nWe planned on doing this anyway, but the hurricane decided to start the process early for us. A few finishing touches still need to be done but I had to share this!",

Very much not legal here in my part of Massachuestts; I am curious.\n\nWhen looking at changing a crawl space - anything you do to change the ventilation or moisture ingress/egress can (will) result in changes to the moisture levels under there, with follow-on effects up through as least the first few feet of the building above it. I am not an expert in the field, but know enough to know it can create huge problems.",
