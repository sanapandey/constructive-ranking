            "body": "My partner and I have wanted a new sink ever since we bought the house. I surprised her and took a day off work to install it. I used a diamond blade on my variable speed angle grinder to cut the granite. To contain the dust, I used a painters tarp mostly sealed around the cabinets and countertops. I also put a fan in the window to extract dust. My respirator filters are filled, glad I had that. I also had goggles and some 3M bluetooth hearing protection.\n\nFrom start to finish, not including breaks or the trip to the hardware store for some PVC, I'd say this took about four hours with cleanup.",
