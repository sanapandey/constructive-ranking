It was very sticky stuff and was quite hard peeling off but did the job of keeping any dirt and paint off our carpet\n\nEver since we took this off our carpets now sound very crunchy to walk on and the Mrs can't stand it!\n\nIt's been a few months and the noise has not gone away so does anyone have any suggestions to get it back to normal?\n\nI'm thinking maybe a carpet cleaner/steamer might do the trick?",
