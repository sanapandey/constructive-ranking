    "selftext": "I'm looking to have closed cell spray foam installed under my home. We live in northwest Florida & Im having condensation/mildew/high humidity problems in my home (during the summer) due to a dirt crawlspace & it having excessive moisture. Unfortunately Noone is willing to do it so my husband & I will have to DIY. My husband is dead set on spray foam in a can & no other kind. I've been trying to do my research & am lost. I'd like something with some fire resistance as thats one of my fears. I've found 2 brands (AKFix 840p & Vegabond purple). I've read that it needs to be covered but our home is so low to the ground that it's not possible. I've also read that if it did catch fire the fumes would kill you quicker than the fire would.\n1. Which brand would be best?\n2. Will it be OK not being covered?\n3. Are the fumes really that bad if fire did occur? \nAny tips/tricks would be greatly appreciated.\n\n*Edit to add* My husband says he just wants to insulate under our additions at the moment. Which is roughly 600sq ft.",

            "body": "This is an incomplete fix that may do more harm than good. Not a contractor, but researched the hell out of this - as far as I've found and done (almost done!) - \n\nYou need a 12mil vapor barrier on the ground, taped with crawlspace tape. You also need 12 mil or light vapor barrier that comes up the perimeter beam and the piers, and is fastened with butyl tape and mechanical fasteners. This keeps moisture from under the house and the exterior perimeter from getting under the floor. If you just foam the perimeter, moisture's going to come in and be trapped.\n\nYou need to make certain there's no rodent ingress, no rats or mice to chew up your work, too. \n\nSpray foam in a can - jesus, he's gonna need case after case. They sell kits with canisters of 2-part foam to DIY large areas like this. \n\nThen you seal the joist bays and the long-perpendicular joist runs with spray foam or foam boards. You seal it all up air tight. You insulate the perimeter beam with 2\" foam boards or spray. You seal up and insulate any foundation vents and make sure any doorways/access hatches to the exterior are weather sealed and insulated. \n\nThen you run some power and install an automatic dehumidifier, and suss out how to get the water out (usually they have or interface with a pump). They kick in when humidity reaches a set percent. You can get some inexpensive temp and humidity monitors that you can check with your phone, too. \n\nIn cold climates, some people run a branch from their HVAC down there and condition the space; in humid climates, AC down there can help dry the air. Then you need to decide on an exhaust or return, some people say \"no return\", old house floors will let air move, some say a powered vent to the exterior, some say run a return to your HVAC before the filter. Google up EnergyStar articles on this, they're very complete. \n\nYou might also want to do a radon test before you do anything else and decide if you need a radon system. Often that's corrugated landscape pipe to a 3\" PVC that exits through the roof. \n\nBut big-picture, do it wrong and you'll just trap humidity and end up with rot and smells.",
