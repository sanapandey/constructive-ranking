The strumming of the old lacquer was a mess pain especially from all the grooves.  But then I sanded everything down, tack clothed it and painted.  Leaded that even a foam brush isn\u2019t going to be 100% smooth.",

Painting keeps it from heading to the junk yard. And then one day someone can buy it from OP, scrape all the paint off, realise that the original wood was in terrible shape, and that they are in over their head on this little refinishing project, and then they will throw it in the trash.",
