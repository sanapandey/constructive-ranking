    "selftext": "I noticed this post for a porch was rotting away. The post was previously lined like in Pic 3. Seems the builders did not think about rain sitting inside the crevice, and my concern is it will eventually rot away and bring the porch down. The pillar still has quite a bit of meat on it, so I'm thinking that if I prevent any more water from sitting in there, I could buy myself a few more years before having to think about it again. Any thoughts? What is the right thing to do and what is the not-so-right/quick fix?",

It is common to clad small posts with planks and trim to make them appear beefier.\n\nUse a screwdriver to probe the post base.  See how deep you can push it into the wood. \n\nIf I might be correct, all you\u2019d need to do is jack up that structure an inch or so and then slide a post base into the hole.",
