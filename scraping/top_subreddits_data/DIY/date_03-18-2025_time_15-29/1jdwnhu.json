I\u2019m going up this weekend to help with some repairs and want to resolve this. The refrigerator is next to the cabinets but the cold water connection under the kitchen sink is 15\u2019 away and the line will have to be run through several cabinets and behind the range.\n\nWould it be acceptable to drill holes in the rear bottom corners of the cabinets and run a 20\u2019 stainless braided supply line with compression fittings or do I need to use a copper supply line and then convert to a flexible supply line once we are out of the cabinets and behind the fridge?\n\n",

His kitchen is old so we just need it to last a few more years and then when he\u2019s ready to change it, we\u2019ll run the line in the wall, the right way. \n\nDef recommend 1/4\u201d copper line, for the sake of your daughter\u2019s kitchen. Also since you said the cabinets are old and not in great condition, maybe think about running it at the toe kick but at the top (if that make sense? Then it\u2019s exposed, but mostly hidden except when going around corners - and you could drill holes to recess it at those parts.\n\nIf you have pictures of the kitchen, we might be able to suggest other ideas.
