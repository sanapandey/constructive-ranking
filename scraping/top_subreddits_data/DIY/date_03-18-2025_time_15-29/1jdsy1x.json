    "selftext": "I have a brick fireplace with 2 exposed corners that run from floor to ceiling. I also have a 9 month old baby. I need to cover the corners with something so she doesn\u2019t hurt herself. I would prefer something a little more sophisticated that cutting and glueing pool noodles which is/was my first plan. Any ideas or examples are appreciated ",
