I love the simplicity of the hardware plus the integrated software solution.\n\nAs someone who recently did a bunch of research on 3D video recorders, the best I found was a modded QooCam 3 Ultra by /u/AppealMundane5486. For anyone interested, there are lots of info here: /r/Q3UltraVR180 and /r/VR180Film\n\nI personally think 8K is the bare minimum for 3D video capture but a lot of those pixels are wasted in a 180 degree format. I'd much prefer a lighter 8K camera where more pixels go into a smaller than 180 degree FOV. I'd be using the camera to capture my daughter growing up so perhaps 60 FPS would be important too (since I'm capturing an erratically moving live subject \ud83d\ude05)\n\nYour camera gets closer to what I have in mind so I hope you make good progress on this! I'd seriously consider your product if your second version has what I'm looking for above.",
