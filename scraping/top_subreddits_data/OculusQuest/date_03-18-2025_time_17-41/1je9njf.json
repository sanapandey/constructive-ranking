    "selftext": "I bought my first Quest 3 a few weeks ago. Until now, I had only tried virtual reality a couple of times, and those sessions were quite short, but since I bought mine, I\u2019ve been hooked, haha. I have a friend, so I\u2019ve been playing almost three hours every day.\n\nNow, at no point did I feel nausea or anything like that; I adapted pretty well. But lately, I\u2019ve been having really strange dreams related to virtual reality, and specifically in the past few days, I started feeling weird. For example, today I haven\u2019t touched the headset, but I woke up with this feeling. It\u2019s as if my brain thinks I\u2019m inside a game. When I look at my phone screen, it feels like a virtual reality screen, and I feel like my hands are moving strangely, as if they have a tiny delay.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences when starting with VR? It\u2019s not annoying for now, but it is a really strange sensation.",

I had to poke stuff and people in real life to make sure they were really there, hands felt weird, the sense of my own height compared to my surroundings too. Waking up after falling asleep for a quick nap while watching a show inside the headset felt like the most surreal experience, and I've taken a bunch of psychotropes before. \n\nIt was kinda scary and a good thing I wasn't busy with work at the time. I'm happy it didn't last lol, now walking around my house with passthrough is like second nature.",

I however find it especially happens after more intensive experiences that are much more physical or jostling. Kind of like getting onto one of those moving walkways at airports and things where when you get off, you feel a lot slower and weird while your body/brain need to adjust again. Plenty of gamers experience vivid dreams of games they really like temporarily, and VR is no different. \n\nThe only difference here, in my opinion, is that because it's more immersive and physical, it can feel like you have to \"re-calibrate\" for a hot second. I'd recommend taking more frequent breaks in-between sessions and taking note of what games/apps/experiences are more likely to trigger this. Additionally, rest those eyes, maybe go get a walk, and stay hydrated.",

            "body": "Had it years ago as well.. It's called VR Dissociation....\n\nTLDR: VR dissociation is a temporary altered state of consciousness that can occur during or after using VR headsets, causing feelings of disconnection, depersonalization, derealization, confusion, anxiety, or nausea. It\u2019s triggered by sensory overload, immersion, cognitive dissonance, or individual susceptibility. To manage it, take breaks, start gradually, avoid intense content, and seek help if it persists. It usually resolves quickly but can rarely lead to bigger issues.\n\nLong Explanation by an AI:\n\n Virtual Reality (VR) Dissociation\u00a0\nVR dissociation refers to a temporary altered state of consciousness that can occur during or after using VR headsets. It involves a feeling of disconnection from oneself, the environment, or both.\u00a0\nSymptoms:\u00a0\nDepersonalization: Feeling detached from one\u2019s own body or mind, Derealization: Feeling like the world around is unreal or distorted, Confusion and disorientation, Anxiety and fear, and Nausea and motion sickness.\u00a0\nCauses:\u00a0\nSensory overload:\nVR headsets provide intense sensory stimulation, which can overwhelm the brain and cause dissociation.\u00a0\nImmersion:\nVR creates a highly immersive environment that can make it difficult to distinguish between the real and virtual world.\u00a0\nCognitive dissonance:\nThe brain may struggle to reconcile the conflicting information from the real and virtual worlds, leading to dissociation.\u00a0\nIndividual susceptibility:\nSome people are more prone to experiencing VR dissociation than others.\u00a0\nManagement:\nTake breaks:\nAvoid prolonged VR use and take frequent breaks to re-ground yourself in reality.\u00a0\nStart gradually:\nBegin with shorter VR sessions and gradually increase the duration as you adapt.\u00a0\nUse caution with intense content:\nAvoid VR experiences that are overly violent or disturbing.\u00a0\nSeek professional help if necessary:\nIf VR dissociation becomes persistent or interferes with daily life, consult a healthcare professional.\nNote: VR dissociation is typically temporary and resolves on its own within a few hours or days. However, in rare cases, it can lead to more serious mental health issues. It\u2019s important to be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions to minimize them",

Everything is at the same focal length no matter how far it appears to be.  Visually you are moving but your inner ear says you aren't, no sense of acceleration.  The direction of gravity may  even be different than what your inner ear feels.  The distance objects appear and actually are may be slightly off (one of the reasons IPD is important)\n\nYour brain has to learn these new \"rules\" to reality, rules that go against everything you've experienced.  This takes some time to learn, some more than others.  A problem adapting is what leads people to things like motion sickness, because their multiple senses are conflicting with each other.\n\nYour brain then has to learn when to apply the \"normal\" rules vs \"VR\" rules to reality.  This can take some time as well, and can result in your brain trying to apply the wrong set of rules to a situation.  When it's trying to apply the VR rules when you aren't using VR it gives you a sense of dissociation, like everything is wrong somehow.  Eventually your brain learns when to switch modes on the fly and can do so instantly.\n\nIt's much the same as how people who have been out to sea on a smaller boat can come back to land and feel like everything is rocking.  Their brain is still trying to compensate for the constant motion of waves.  Astronauts have to deal with the same thing after extended stays in the ISS.  After weeks or months suddenly they can no longer float through the air, they have to maintain momentum, objects don't stay midair when let go, and so on.",

It's called VR Dissociation....\n\nTLDR: VR dissociation is a temporary altered state of consciousness that can occur during or after using VR headsets, causing feelings of disconnection, depersonalization, derealization, confusion, anxiety, or nausea. It\u2019s triggered by sensory overload, immersion, cognitive dissonance, or individual susceptibility. To manage it, take breaks, start gradually, avoid intense content, and seek help if it persists. It usually resolves quickly but can rarely lead to bigger issues.\n\nLong Explanation by an AI:\n\n Virtual Reality (VR) Dissociation\u00a0\nVR dissociation refers to a temporary altered state of consciousness that can occur during or after using VR headsets. It involves a feeling of disconnection from oneself, the environment, or both.\u00a0\nSymptoms:\u00a0\nDepersonalization: Feeling detached from one\u2019s own body or mind, Derealization: Feeling like the world around is unreal or distorted, Confusion and disorientation, Anxiety and fear, and Nausea and motion sickness.\u00a0\nCauses:\u00a0\nSensory overload:\nVR headsets provide intense sensory stimulation, which can overwhelm the brain and cause dissociation.\u00a0\nImmersion:\nVR creates a highly immersive environment that can make it difficult to distinguish between the real and virtual world.\u00a0\nCognitive dissonance:\nThe brain may struggle to reconcile the conflicting information from the real and virtual worlds, leading to dissociation.\u00a0\nIndividual susceptibility:\nSome people are more prone to experiencing VR dissociation than others.\u00a0\nManagement:\nTake breaks:\nAvoid prolonged VR use and take frequent breaks to re-ground yourself in reality.\u00a0\nStart gradually:\nBegin with shorter VR sessions and gradually increase the duration as you adapt.\u00a0\nUse caution with intense content:\nAvoid VR experiences that are overly violent or disturbing.\u00a0\nSeek professional help if necessary:\nIf VR dissociation becomes persistent or interferes with daily life, consult a healthcare professional.\nNote: VR dissociation is typically temporary and resolves on its own within a few hours or days. However, in rare cases, it can lead to more serious mental health issues. It\u2019s important to be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions to minimize them",

Now all of a sudden, your brain is experiencing something that looks like a real world, but must keep reminding itself that it is actually in fact, not really objects, landscape, etc. then, you periodically go into and out of this virtual space. Your brain is simply trying to adjust to \u201cdeciding\u201d what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. The good news is, your brain is probably the fastest and most efficient adaptation machine in existence, so those feelings will fade, especially with time when you just forget about it.
