    "selftext": "I admit I was very snobby about beat saber. I didn\u2019t think it would be that great and was very resistant to trying it. I was so very very wrong. I have been humbled. \n\nThe joy that the Britney expansion brought me last night brought me back to the days of my childhood playing Britney\u2019s dance beat with my sister on PS4 religiously. Now I get the joy of that with some dancing mixed in. \n\nLesson learned. Thank ye VR gods for this bounty you have brought us. Amen.\n\n\nEdit: can\u2019t edit the title but yes I mean Beat Saber!",
