    "selftext": "So, I want to use a cable to connect my computer. Preferably it should be 22-26 feet and a USB-A port. it also doesn't need to have charging capabilities, but it would be nice. Any suggestions? \n\nI want one with a USB-A port because my computer only has one and I don't know if it can support my headset. \n\nYes I know about air link and it hasn't worked for me, im pretty sure it is because my router isn't directly connected to my computer and my router isn't good enough. And before you say to just get a router, I really don't want to spend a ton of money on one.",
