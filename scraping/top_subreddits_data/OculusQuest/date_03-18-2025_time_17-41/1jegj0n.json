    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I have this glitch that doesn't allow me to play Thrill of the Fight 2 with Roomscale mode. I would appreciate knowing how to fix it without having to return.\n\nI don't know if it's because I have developer mode on (tried turning it off with my phone but didn't do anything), but I have tried over 5 times and kept drawing roomscale boundaries, even bigger than my room which worked the last few times, but now everytime I try to use Roomscale with the game it gives me this weird bubbly circle boundary set to 1.20x1.20 and whatever I do it doesn't let me change it. \n\nI don't have laying down mode on. I've restarted it multiple times, haven't factory resetted yet. I turned all the boundary sensitivity settings to the lowest possible. The boundary setting is still on in developer mode. I can turn it off but if I want to play TOTF2 it requires me to keep it on. \n\nI've only had my headset for 2 weeks and it's already malfunctioning. Even the controllers aren't working that well anymore in the menu, whenever I try to scroll or use the trigger buttons (especially on the right controller).",
