            "body": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m Ken, the solo dev behind BattleGroupVR! I built the first game because I wanted a space RTS where you could command a fleet from the bridge of your own flagship\u2014not just as some distant observer. It was an amazing journey, and I\u2019m so grateful for all the support from players.\n\nNow, I\u2019m making a bigger, better sequel that expands on everything I loved about the first game. This time, you\u2019ll be able to explore an open-world galaxy, take on missions, mine, trade, and grow your fleet however you want.\n\nI just launched the Quest Coming Soon page, and wishlisting really helps a ton. Please check it out! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThanks so much, and I can\u2019t wait to share more soon!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 META QUEST: [https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/battlegroupvr2/9386827918099701/](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/battlegroupvr2/9386827918099701/)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 STEAM PAGE: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3385960/BattleGroupVR2/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3385960/BattleGroupVR2/)",

You don't control like 10000 ships you control the main big ships and assign commanders to them and like have rpg elements to each ship (like build more defense or more cannons or focused on lasers which break shields but not dmg etc). Plus you start off with one and slowly get more. \n\nI put off the first one forever because I thought it would be more all over the place but it fit VR really well and I never felt overwhelmed.\n\nThe only reason I never finished was because I felt it got a bit grindy like I needed to replay missions to get money to actually be able to complete the next mission so I hope they reworked the game's curve a bit",

Anything that can be grabbed, turned, pushed or pulled should hopefully be able to be manipulated from afar.\n\nLove the game concept though. Looking forward to trying this one out.",

Or maybe just some kind of mode where (and I\u2019ve always wanted to see this kind of thing but no one has ever done it) you\u2019re playing some kind of limited campaign (like maybe it takes 40 hours of real time play to finish on average) where it\u2019s online but every server has settings that limit when the game is playable. So people can agree, we\u2019ll play 1 hour every day at 6:00 until that particular game is finished.
