Like ovrtool which not many users use it but for those who use it simplifies getting information in the device. Lying mode or accessibility as well. I don't buying this bs. They removed chromecast once so they can again. Some companies just hiding features in menu to downgrade your experience with updates (samsung for example). I think it will be replaced by an 3rd party app soon but i liked such features. They added hdmi out, hdmi in. But most of that is for hard users. I hardly believe that many users attach video grabbers into usb-c where you have to plugin hdmi cable. They removing this due some big os redesign which we probably don't need + layoffs and cutting investments.",

Because for years they refused to make app lab part of the official store because of this exact reason. But tons of people were complaining and begged to make app lab part of the store like Steam does it with indie games. They finally caved and now everyone is bitching that all the app lab crapware is flooding the store. lol",

It's relatively easy for each app to do its own calorie tracking - inconsistently, by the way - but what about fitness device integration, or data export, or being able to see your data in the app, integrating it with Apple Health and other services? You know, things that you are able to do universally when it's built into the OS?\n\nI got over it, I just know what it means - disinvestment in the space, which is exactly what I pointed out. But I'm the one with the strawman, sure.",

Making more strawman arguments over an app no one used. The key point you keep leaving out of your dramatic scenarios. No one was using the move app for fitness. \n\nThe dramatics in this sub is bothering pathetic over every little thing, but you do you, tho.",
