I think this is already looking good but may have great title game potential and sandbox games tend to be a bit large, I personally would love to see the project blossom. \n\nI don't have any dev skills and wouldn't know anyone myself, but as a consumer when I see someone have a good idea and start to execute it well, it's sad not to see them get as much support to make that good idea into a brilliant end product. It's happened with a lot of indie gemstones with great integral ideas. Overgrowth and Exanima comes to mind.\n\nI'm sure there are some people out there that would be willing to work on this project with you for free to make \"*The VR GTA\"*, but also I don't know how the community works lol.",
