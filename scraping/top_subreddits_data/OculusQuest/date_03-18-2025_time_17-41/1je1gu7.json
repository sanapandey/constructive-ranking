    "selftext": "Just tried Parallax VR app on Quest. It's an app that has 3d photos with limited 6dof (you can only move around a bit). Every 3D photo was created from one single 2D photo with the help of AI.\n\nLet me just say I was sceptic. I saw many of those automatic AI 2d to 3d conversions and they were all pretty disappointing.  \nBut as soon as I loaded the first photo in Parallax VR my mind was blown!\n\nI won't exaggerate if I'll say this was the closest I've ever felt to being transported to a real location inside VR.\n\nThis is much \\*much\\* better than spatial photos! The scale is incredible. Load up some of those mountain shots and be amazed.\n\nI'd say it's even more realistic than photogrammetry and splats. While those have advantage to be in 360 degrees and you're able to walk around, they still feel a bit artificial and \"gamified\" (for lack of better description).\n\nThose Parallax photos feel more real than anything I saw in VR yet (as far as virtual tourism goes).  \nYes, you can still see some AI artefacts (remember, 6dof 3D was created from one single angle), it still looks fantastic. And I'm sure it will get even better with time.\n\nI hope devs will release an app that will let us convert our own photos to 6dof 3D.\n\nGive it a try: [https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/parallax/8267831776652398/?srsltid=AfmBOoorRzCK78LbvXECVh94TLKquYrf449M3eZgGH2MMyqpK4561JMx](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/parallax/8267831776652398/?srsltid=AfmBOoorRzCK78LbvXECVh94TLKquYrf449M3eZgGH2MMyqpK4561JMx)",

If all you need are good photos to turn them into something this cool, then we are up for a treat. I also hope there will be an option to convert your own photos or they will keep adding new photos regularly.",

And yes, we'd absolutely love to launch user generated content app. The only question is whether we'll have enough resources for this. Right now, we are open to collaborating with a small number of travel photographers (pros and enthusiasts) willing contribute some amazing locations and events to Parallax",

On the other hand Wander and Google Street View never did much for me. So different strokes for different folks, I guess.\n\nThe quality of depth you get in Parallax is something I never experienced in any stereoscopic photo or video. It\u2019s completely natural. Coupled with the fact that you can get such results from one single photo, it\u2019s incredibly exciting.",
