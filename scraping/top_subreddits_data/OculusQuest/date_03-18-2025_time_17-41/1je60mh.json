There's cool new weapons, the threat feels bigger and the hordes feel harder. You even have to go out and do missions at night in this one, plus you have a villain hunting you throughout the story which increases the intensity. \n\nFor such a low price it's really a no-brainer game, and will make any jank feel like less of a big deal.",
