I'm interested in looking at the future of AR with smartglasses, but I also what to look at current technologies like the Meta Quest to see what could be possible today.\n\nI\u2019m currently running my first study and would be grateful for any responses! Here\u2019s some information below:\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Ever found social interactions tricky\u2014whether in casual chats, professional settings, or group situations? We're exploring the challenges people face in everyday social interactions and how augmented reality (AR) might shape these experiences in the future.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Share your thoughts. It\u2019s quick (\\~10 min), and you\u2019ll have a chance to win one of two \u00a350 Amazon vouchers!\n\n\ud83d\udccb Join the discussion here: [https://uofg.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_eXOFsQ7PP5itDVQ](https://uofg.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eXOFsQ7PP5itDVQ)\n\nYour perspective could help shape the future of AR in everyday life!",

Like when I see Jim from work, I get a reminder to ask him about XYZ. \n\nObviously that's probably a more AR glasses type thing and would need facial recognition and feels like a long shot, but it's the sort of practical application that would be handy. \n\nThe same sort of things for location based reminders would be cool too, like grocery lists, parts lists at a hardware store, and so on.\n\nAnyway, filled it out!",

I think people should be able to be comfortable to ask people straight out about something even if they forgot and should not be judged poorly for forgetting.\n\nIn addition, people will not act 'normally' if being recorded.  The idea of living in a society where everything you do is recorded and put up for judgment is restrictive.  Yes, it will make the prosecution of law much easier and it will force people to follow societal norms but who will be the ones in power to choose what is normal.  Normalizing surveillance is already here.\n\nWe are all so different and that is what makes us interesting.  Homogeny is kind of boring.  Efficient, yes, but still boring.\n\nEDIT: on the positive side, i think real-time translation is a great tool for ar glasses.  communication is key.",
