    "selftext": "Yesterday my younger brother, a nurse, broke us the news that our great uncle, was rushed in the ER. They ran some test, they found that his brain was swollen and there was a huge blood clot.\n\nMy mother, the kind soul that she is, was sad and filled with worries, but I? I was indiffirent. I wasn't shocked nor given any time to process the \"sad\" news.\n\nShe seemed disappointed and asked why was I acting cold.\n\nI told her that I don't particularly care what happened, and said that he was a terrible person so he doesn't deserve my time, respect, prayers or my sympathy.\n\n\nFrom the stories they've told me, aswell from personal experiences;\n\n- He always cheated on my great aunt, up until 2010, he was 67 and she was 62.\n\n- He left their family for 20 years for random women.\n\n- He laughed at the way my grandfather, mom's dad, died 3 years ago, and said it was \"a pathetic way to go out\".\n\n- He's a kleptomaniac, he keeps taking shoes and caps from visitors and guests, including mine. Fortunately one of my uncles either replaces it or takes it when the old man's not looking. (I believe they reinforced his behavior with this)\n\n- One summer, when I stayed in their house, he ate one of the food I brought for myself because he thought \"it was for sharing\", and yet he finished it in one sitting. I told that to my great aunt she apologized ang paid me, and said just use the groceries in the fridge and just whip myself a meal. And when I used their stove later? The old man suddenly appeared and stopped me from cooking, returned the everything back to the fridge, turned off the stove, and \"reprimanded\" me for using their and \"stealing\" their food.\n\n- During a family reunion the bastard once blew smoke right to my face as a \"joke\" and an \"invitation to start smoking\".\n\n- Mocks people with disabilities, and sometimes taunts them.\n\n- Dude's a racist and a bigot.\n\n- Constantly finds a way to argue and debate with me. (They say he probably does this to me because he knows I don't tolerate his bullshit and calls him out and doesn't shy away to put him in his place.)\n\n\nYou're probably asking why and how does he get away from being a shitty person? Dementia. Under the guise of suspected dementia (not diagnosed) we were asked to understand him and just ignore what he say and do. But even before the 'signs' of dementia the guy was an atrocious human being.\n\nI've just extended and prolonged my patience for him because of the respect and adoration for my grandmother and uncles. But now since he's dead I think I don't have to pretend to like the guy anymore.\n\nBut I digress,\n\n\nMy mom called me a dick because even though that this man was a shitty person he still deserves to be mourned, and have prayers offered and to have sympathy for, and he's still \"family\".\n\n\n\nSo with this information, is it not justified that I haven't been \"more emotional\" on this man's death?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: GREAT UNCLE and GREAT AUNT\n\nSorry for the confusion, these terms doesn't exist from where I'm from.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nYesterday my younger brother, a nurse, broke us the news that our grandfather was rushed in the ER. They ran some test, they found that his brain was swollen and there was a huge blood clot.\n\nMy mother, the kind soul that she is, was sad and filled with worries, but I? I was indiffirent. I wasn't shockednnor given any time to process the \"sad\" news.\n\nShe seemed disappointed and asked why was acting cold.\n\nI told her that I don't particularly care what happened, and said that he was a terrible person so he doesn't deserve my time, respect, prayers or my sympathy.\n\n\nFrom the stories they've told me, aswell from personal experiences;\n\n- He always cheated on a grandmother of mine, mother's aunt, up until he 2010, he was 67 and she was 62.\n\n- He left their family for 20 years for random women.\n\n- He laughed at the way my grandfather died 3 years ago, and said it was \"a pathetic way to go out\".\n\n- He's a kleptomaniac, he keeps taking shoes and caps from visitors and guests, including mine. Fortunately one of my uncles either replaces it or takes it when the old man's not looking. (I believe they reinforced his behavior with this)\n\n- One summer, when I stayed in their house, he ate one of the food I brought for myself because he thought \"it was for sharing\", and yet he finished it in one sitting. I told that to my grandmother she apologized ang paid me, and said just use the groceries in the fridge and just whip myself a meal. And when I used their stove later? The old man suddenly appeared and stopped me from cooking, returned the everything back to the fridge, turned off the stove, and \"reprimanded\" me for using their and \"stealing\" their food.\n\n- During a family reunion the bastard once blew smoke right to my face as a \"joke\" and an \"invitation to start smoking\".\n\n- Mocks people with disabilities, and sometimes taunts them.\n\n- Dude's a racist and a bigot.\n\n- Constantly finds a way to argue and debate with me. (They say he probably does this to me because he knows I don't tolerate his bullshit and calls him out and doesn't shy away to put him in his place.)\n\n\nYou're probably asking why and how does he get away from being a shitty person? Dementia. Under the guise of suspected dementia (not diagnosed) we were asked to understand him and just ignore what he say and do. But even before the 'signs' of dementia the guy was an atrocious human being.\n\nI've just extended and prolonged my patience for him because of the respect and adoration for my grandmother and uncles. But now since he's dead I think I don't have to pretend to like the guy anymore.\n\nBut I digress,\n\n\nMy mom called me a dick because even though that this man was a shitty person he still deserves to be mourned, and have prayers offered and to have sympathy for, and he's still \"family\".\n\n\n\nSo with this information, is it not justified that I haven't been \"more emotional\" on this man's death?\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
