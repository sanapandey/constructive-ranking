    "selftext": "So back in 2020 I got hit by a car on my bike while riding to work and had some medical issues for a while, during this time my then girlfriend now wife more or less told me to stop working because I was in a lot of pain and sitting for 8 hours was really not helping that. I had intended to return to work once everything was better but by the time I was better my wife just said that having me at home when she got back from her job with a clean house and an actual warm meal was amazing and ultimately she made more than enough to support both of us (She is a higher level manager at a corporate job) I never really enjoyed my job and so I agreed after a few long talks. \n\nSo that's been how my life has been since, I'm a good cook so I make something she wants and other than that do the basics to make sure there isn't a big mess. other than that I just do whatever. My brother on the other hand has pretty much always bounced around low income jobs and can't hold down even the most basic of employment for more than a year. He's been working at the same place for around 6 months now and recently we (my wife, parents, brother, sister, and myself) were having dinner at my parents house for my moms birthday. \n\nDuring this dinner my brother started making fun of me for being unemployed and sitting around the house all day being a \"housewife\" and other generally childish insults. I ignored him for a while until he was told off by my mom and he told her to mind her business, once he insulted her all bets were off and I was done trying to make it a nice birthday for her.\n\nI just brought up how he hasn't had a job last for more than a year while my last job I worked at for 4 years before getting hit by a car. He got really angry and told me I was a lazy person (not his words) who sat around all day while getting waited on by his wife (not his words) and then stormed out calling me an asshole. \n\nDad and Wife are on my side, Mom is just annoyed her party was ruined and Sister doesn't want to touch the situation with a 20 foot pole. they're all family though and judgements can be skewed. \n\nReddit though, doesn't pull punches AITA?",

You do have a job, you work at home so your wife can come home and relax instead of having to do the housework like most other women. I think it's admirable; some men wouldn't be comfortable doing what you do, but you are and you are providing work that makes life better for both you and your wife. \n\nYour brother was trying to make you feel badly about something that makes sense for the two of you. She goes to work for pay, you stay at home and work for a good life. \n\nIt's unfortunate that your brother popped off to your mother and told her to mind her business when she told him off. That's the thing that ruined the evening, not so much you defending yourself. It seems that your wife and you have a more stable life than your brother and he is probably jealous, deep down, even though he said you were unemployed. \n\nI'm sorry you were injured being hit by a car; it must have been a difficult recovery, and I suspect it's still causing some issues for you. Continue to take care of yourself and your wife and let your brother go pound some sand, because he shouldn't be trying to come off as superior to you.",
