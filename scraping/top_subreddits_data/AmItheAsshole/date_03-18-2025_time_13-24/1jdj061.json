    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy son is getting married to a hindu women. We are a non religious family so he has opted to embrace the traditions of his partner and her family. As such the wedding will be a full on traditional hindu wedding.\n\nI've been asked to wear the traditional clothing of their tradition. It includes a skirt type piece that I don't like.\n\nI told my son I'm not comfortable wearing that since it's not my culture plus in my country, I want to dress like my countryman. But it seems there is a hard stop on this since to participate in the religious ceremony I need to wear it. I've told them I'm more comfortable wearing something with trousers that isnt the tradition.\n\nThey have accepted that I can wear the trousers but my son is being stubborn and wants me to wear the real traditional clothing.\n\nMy wife is very excited to be wearing the traditional clothing as are my daughters. I'm just not keen.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to wear hindu clothing to my sons hindu wedding?\n\n\u00a0edit: to clear up some confusion I am M60 and[ this is the type of clothes i'm being asked to wear](https://manyavar.scene7.com/is/image/manyavar/SOSK715_302-CREAM.37225_17-11-2023-17-27:650x900). The reason I need to wear it I believe is because i'll be on the stage participating in the actual ceremony",

This has caused conflict with my son, who strongly wants me to wear the traditional attire as part of the religious ceremony. I might be the asshole because my refusal could be seen as disrespectful to his fianc\u00e9's culture and family, making it seem like I am unwilling to fully embrace an important tradition on their special day.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n[Check out our holiday break announcement here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h3wnsj/aita_monthly_open_forum_december_2024_a_holiday/)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In the US, if you want an occasion to wear a kilt, they are weirdly common at gaming and anime conventions lol. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend checking out a Scottish Games sometime! Much tasty food and many fun events to watch, and you get to enjoy bagpipes in their natural habitat (outdoors, and somewhat in the distance) which makes them sound lovely lol.\n\nFor your first kilt, I recommend a [Sport Kilt](https://sportkilt.com/product-category/mens-kilts/the-original-sport-kilt/). They're machine-washable! :D",

Also had pre attached shorts inside. They even come with pockets.\n\nMy dad loves wearing the traditional cotton ones during the summer because they get so airy underneath and cool you really quick lol.\n\nAlso in these types of ceremonies, a lot of people change into more comfortable clothing after the ritual part is over so that they can enjoy the rest of wedding.

You're the father of the groom but you're acting like the sullen teenage younger brother who doesn't want to wear a suit.\n\nIt's a religious ceremony.  You don't have to be part of it if you aren't comfortable with it.  But it's incredibly rude to insist on attending and refusing to follow the wishes of the bride and groom.  I'm pretty sure the reason that your SON is the one insisting, is that your future in-laws don't want to be too demanding, so HE has to stick up for HIS BRIDE.\n\nI attended a Catholic wedding two weeks ago.  I'm Protestant.  They of course do a whole Mass including Communion.  I sang the responses. I stood when others stood, and I sat when they said \"sit or kneel.\" They quite clearly indicated that non-Catholics were not to take Communion, so I didn't.   As a guest at THEIR religious ceremony, I did what THEY wanted a non-Catholic to do.\n\nYou would do well to remember that the wedding is NOT ABOUT YOU.  It's about being supportive of the bride and groom.  It's not like you're being asked to wear a kilt with nothing underneath.  Yes there's a \"skirt piece\" or a knee-length \"dress\" but it's worn over pants.\n\nWhat you're not understanding is, you will stick out if you DON'T wear the traditional clothing, much more than if you dress like everyone else--just like the sullen teenager who is wearing jeans and a polo to a formal wedding.\n\n**EDIT:**  To respond to OP's edit.\n\nOP clarifies that he is being asked to be \"on stage\" and PART OF the ceremony.  If he wanted to simply attend and observe, he wouldn't be being asked to wear the traditional garb.  And that he can change clothes for the reception, if he wants.\n\nThis is a completely normal and reasonable ask by the bride and groom.  If you don't want to wear the correct clothing, don't be IN the ceremony.\n\n*I'm M62 if it matters, and as I've mentioned in other comments, I have worn \"Biblical\" costumes for religious plays at Easter, at church.  I've also done community theatre, so I'm more comfortable in costume than most people.*",

I was breaking the rules, but I had no choice if I didn't want to pass out. The nun in charge did kind of know, but I was a really good altar boy, so she looked the other way.

I was born there and grew up there (and currently live just 40 miles south of the border), and I can tell you it really bugs us when American tourists turn up and claim to be Scottish because their great-great-great-whatever came from Scotland.

But requiring the whole party of people invited to specifically participate as part of the wedding ceremony isn't necessarily. \n\nI feel like I regularly see posts in this sub about people in a similar situation,  whether it be the bride wants a specific style of dress that isn't compatible with all bodies, or won't budge on a dress vs a matching pantsuit. My takeaway from all of these posts is that if you've been invited to be IN the wedding,  you can always ask for an exemption or alternate but similar garmet, but if the marrying parties don't like that, either suck it up or tell them you can no longer attend.\n\nSpecific requirements for simple attendance seem often to be seen as suggestions, and if the marrying parties really don't want that, I guess they could have the fashion police at the door, but for simply attending the event, that seems incredibly excessive.",

If it were a non ethnic, non religious ceremony and you had requested the bride\u2019s family to dress up in suits and dresses, they would comply too. You can also wear shorts underneath if it\u2019s a lungi or veshti.",

I am an Indian-American (raised Jain and Hindu).\n\nI understand that some sects and practitioners might be more strict than others, but I've been to plenty of Hindu weddings in my 60 years. It's very common for men (both in the States and in India) to wear pants. In fact, I've only seen the religious officiant wearing the dhoti.\n\nSo I really have to ask if this \"religious clothing rule' the fiance/her family is truly a religious rule; of if they just really, really want you to wear the dhoti.\n\nAnd, frankly, I've been to plenty of mixed (mixed cultures and religions) weddings. The norm and the most gracious approach is that everyone is welcomed in the garb they are most comfortable in and also welcome to wear clothing of the other culture if they would like. There is no gate-keeping and no \"our way is the only correct way\". There is only grace.\n\nAlso, I would hope that BOTH families are open-minded enough to graciously meet each other with open hearts and open minds. The bride and groom are bringing together two different family traditions. It works best when no one insists that only their way is appropriate. The exception to this is when one's traditions or preferences or habits impose upon the other (e.g., expecting to smoke in a non-smoking house, expecting a host who does not drink alcohol or eat meat to offer/serve those things.).\n\nWhen my mom came to America as a new bride, she was comfortable wearing a saree that showed her midriff; she was very uncomfortable wearing a dress that showed her knees... and I'm confident she never once wore anything that showed her shoulders. Her exposed midriff probably scandalized her new American neighbors. It was a good while before my mom felt OK wearing a dress; it was also a while before she felt OK wearing pants. Neither one were things she had ever worn before. But guess what? The neighbors and my parents all accepted each other as they were. And developed close and loving bonds that respected each others differences and comfort levels.\n\nWhen I had my own Indian/Western wedding, the same welcoming and accepting bonds developed. It didn't matter that some were strict vegetarians and others were meat & potato omnivores, some preferred Indian food and dress and others preferred Western food and dress. Our families and embraced each other as we are for over 25 years.\n\nI hope your son understands that you are already embracing and supporting so much of their wedding plans, but you also need him to allow you to be yourself.",

It's very simple. He's putting his own temporary discomfort over making his son happy. His son will look at photos in the wedding album for years to come and remember how out of his entire family, only his dad couldn't get on board and insisted on wearing non-cultural attire.

It\u2019s that someone\u2019s identity is tied to their clothing in a way where they feel extremely uncomfortable wearing clothes that fall outside their comfort zones. This is pretty common especially in older generations and even more so in men. Women have it a bit easier because we are socialized to have our own unique styles. For example we can wear skirts, pants, shorts, dresses, all sorts of different clothing. Men, generally and held to a more limited range of clothing and are often pushed to all dress the same as their peers. And oftentimes, their sense of identity is tied to their clothing in odd ways. \n\nI know tons of people who have weird hangups about what they will or will not wear. I used to think that weird hangups about clothing were more common in women as women tend to be scrutinized more and have more self consciousness about their bodies, but I have found through experience that men often have surprising rigidness about what they wear. It\u2019s not because they are judging people who dress differently, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t feel comfortable venturing out of their comfort zone. \nAn older dude who has been pushed to wear essentially the same thing for his whole life may have a much harder time wearing something new or different. The dude\u2019s wife and daughters may have an easier time because they have been raised and socialized to try new fashions and to have a wide range of styles that they can wear. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that OP is just a racist and doesn\u2019t want to wear the outfit for that reason.

That wouldn't happen in a Catholic wedding. So I don't feel it's a fair comparison. OP also has no religious, cultural, or even sentimental ties to a traditional suit. He just doesn't want to wear a \"skirt.\"",

This is a wonderful opportunity to show that you accept your son's partner into the family, and it's a great way to show that you're happy to be accepted into her family. This isn't a cultural appropriation situation; it's a cultural appreciation thing. You've been invited to engage with another culture and their practices. \n\nIf the issue is modesty, there are fits that are more modest than others, and you can rest assured that you won't be dressed this way alone as everyone else will also be dressed in culturally appropriate attire. They've already worked with you on helping you with a more comfortable cut (trousers instead of a skirt). \n\nIt's important to figure out why you're so resistant to do this for just one day. You haven't really explained beyond the fact that you don't like it. Why don't you like it. Is this really just about the clothes or something else? Is it about your child's choice of partner and you really don't like or accept her, or is it about the culture itself? Do you just hate wearing feminine attire? If it's just the perceived femininity of it all, maybe you can express that you'd prefer something more masculine or a different color or something. \n\nIt's just one day. I'm sure there is a way for you to work with your son and future daughter in law to find a compromise that allows you to meet them halfway while still being comfortable.",

I don't think it's appropriate that the other comments are assuming your gender based on the mention of your wife. We don't know if you're as straight man, a lesbian woman, a non-binary person, or anything else. If I assume that you're a lesbian woman, then I'm immediately uncomfortable with the idea of telling you that you have to wear a skirt. Therefore, I should be equally uncomfortable with saying that to you regardless of your gender. If you're a man, that doesn't magically mean that you should have less right to decide what clothing you're comfortable wearing.\n\nI was going to say that, if you are uncomfortable with the skirt, perhaps you could wear a pants-version of the traditional clothing. I don't know very much about hindu traditional clothing so I'm not sure exactly how difficult this would be, but if you were to wear something that looks like the traditional outfit but with a pair of pants cut to suit the outfit instead of it being a skirt, I think that should be totally acceptable to your son.\n\n> Am I the asshole for not wanting to wear hindu clothing to my sons hindu wedding? \n\nBut it sounds like this isn't about the skirt. It sounds like you're completely unwilling to compromise on clothing at all, and want to show up in what I assume would be a typical western three-piece suit. \n\nAs a general rule, wedding clothing etiquette permits that the couple make generalized requirements of their guests (such as \"formal dress code\" or \"no white dresses, please\"), but not overly specific ones (such as \"everyone must wear purple\"). Requesting that guests dress for a hindu wedding is not, IMO, any different from requesting that guests adhere to a formal or semi-formal dress code. Refusing to wear hindu clothing *of any kind* is definitely stepping over the line. Your son shouldn't demand that you wear a specific *outfit*, but you absolutely need to be willing to adhere to reasonable dress code requests like this one.",

If you are not actively participating and taking on more of a guest/observer role then it is even less important.

We are a non religious family so he has opted to embrace the traditions of his partner and her family. As such the wedding will be a full on traditional hindu wedding.\n\nI've been asked to wear the traditional clothing of their tradition. It includes a skirt type piece that I don't like.\n\nI told my son I'm not comfortable wearing that since it's not my culture plus in my country, I want to dress like my countryman. But it seems there is a hard stop on this since to participate in the religious ceremony I need to wear it. I've told them I'm more comfortable wearing something with trousers that isnt the tradition.\n\nThey have accepted that I can wear the trousers but my son is being stubborn and wants me to wear the real traditional clothing.\n\nMy wife is very excited to be wearing the traditional clothing as are my daughters. I'm just not keen.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to wear hindu clothing to my daughters hindu wedding?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If the skirt(Lengha)  is not to your liking the Salwar Kameez is an option that should be comfortable and easily able to walk in.  I think it would go a long way to developing a relationship with your in-laws family to at least wear their formal dress for the wedding day.

The example you linked to is much more common in South India, whereas North Indian Hindu weddings are likely to have men in bandgalas/ sherwanis/ kurtas and trousers. (That's a long top and matching trouser set). So you should be able to wear the latter. \n\n\nThere are literally hundreds of different Indian communities with different versions of traditional clothing, and these days plenty of people mix and match, so wearing sherwani/ kurta and trousers instead of a shirt and dhoti should be absolutely fine.\n\n\nAs far as participating in the ceremony is considered, parents in Hindu weddings essentially give the bride and groom away to each other. It's pretty ridiculous to think of a parent being alive but not giving away their child during the marriage ceremony. so it would be much more insensitive/ bizarre/ hurtful/ whatever for you to skip that than for you to refrain from wearing a dhoti. \n\n\nAnd I know a lot of Indian men who are also uncomfortable in dhotis, so it's really not that odd a reaction to have. \n\n\nTL;DR: So my advice would be to wear a version of traditional Indian clothing with trousers, and do not skip participating in the rituals coz that would be a dampener from a cultural perspective. And tell your son it's okay for you to not specifically wear a dhoti.",

It would matter more that I was there for him. \nYou need to ask yourself if you can put aside your discomfort for the day or even just the ceremony for the sake of your son or not.

But if you want my opinion , I would say that especially since you're not religious you should respect the traditions of the family and wear what  you've been asked to wear. It's not cultural appropriation if you've been invited to do it. It shows respect to them. It would be one thing if your religion forbade you from dressing in a skirt. I think it would be a beautiful way to show your son and his new wife that you care and are willing to enter into their new life with them as a family. I doubt you'll ever be asked to do it again and I bet they would even be okay with you changing after the ceremony. May I ask if your hesitation has to do with your body and how you think you'll look in the traditional clothing, or is it more to do with your personal belief system? \n\nI also understand that our clothing is our armor and our shield, so if this is an emotional thing for you, I respect that too. Otherwise, I think it would be a beautiful thing to do for your son. \n\nI DO FEEL YA THOUGH. As a woman I can attest to being asked to wear many, many things that I was uncomfortable in as a bridesmaid and it is just something that we do. If you think about it it is something that a lot of people and many cultures have to do - wear things that they're not comfortable with at a wedding ceremony! \n\nI'm not sure what nationality that you are, but it is a universal experience to have to wear what you may think of as a costume. But to somebody else, this is a symbol of respect and camaraderie and family. To wear something brings you into the group. \n\nIt's your choice.

Wear pants. Wear the skirt. This is his CHILD'S wedding. It's important. 50 years of good relationship is worth a few hours of doing something that makes you uncomfortable. It's not always about each individual person being so special and precious that they should never have to give in to make someone else happy. Sometimes, you should do the thing for someone else sake. \n\nBecause you love them. \n\nBecause the relationship is important. \n\nBecause they asked. \n\nIt won't kill him to wear the skirt. It's a temporary, short-term concession that his kid will forever remember and appreciate. OP, YTA, if you don't prioritize your son over short-term discomfort.",

I'll go with NAH, but you're depriving yourself of a very memorable experience.\n\nOn the one hand, if what you want to wear feels respectful and appropriate for a big formal day like your son's wedding, then I don't think that's entirely unreasonable. If its required to partake in the ceremony and you have no problems with how this might make you look or how your son and your in-laws feel, don't partake in the ceremony if its that important to you to wear a suit.\n\nOn the other hand, immersing into another culture that you are invited and encouraged to join in is a great experience and you'd be missing out. Your son wants to show his new family that he's all in on their culture, and if you refuse to wear the requested garment you'd be missing out on a good opportunity to support your son in his new life and family (which will also be your family).\n\nOut of curiosity: Would you be feel uncomfortable if this was a Scottish wedding and you were asked to wear a kilt, even though all the men are wearing them? I'm just wondering if its a \"skirt type piece\" that is an issue, or it's an \"asian skirt type piece\" that bothers you, but a \"white person skirt type piece\" might be okay? Is this just about not wanting to wear a \"skirt\" or being uncomfortable stepping THAT far outside of your cultural comfort zone in something that resembles a skirt? You don't have to answer my question but if you'd wear the kilt but not the dhoti, then maybe you're still not the wedding asshole, but definitely Y-kinda-T-A, in general.",

It's pretty sexy,  actually.   He's of western European stock,  not Scottish,  but likes the comfort. \n\nThe first time you do anything outside your cultural comfort zone,  it can be scary.  I sympathize with the feelings.  But part of being a good person is sometimes putting aside your feelings to do what's appropriate to time and place.  Think of this as a bit of an adventure.  It may help.",

Even if it was nothing to do with the bride and her culture it would be very easy to attribute your behavior to being xenophobic at best or racist at worst.\n\nI suggest you hop onto YouTube and take a look at Nazraana Bridal. They help brides, grooms, and the wedding party get outfits for their cultural ceremonies. It may give you some insight to how much pressure your son and his bride feel to make her family happy and you will see many people have stepped outside their comfort zone for one day.",

I am dating a Hindu man currently and let me say it's a privilege to learn about the culture and to get to participate in it authentically.\n\nDressing up is a big BIG part of respect in a lot of Asian and African cultures.

I would worry about you making a fool of yourself in conversation.\n\nI would look into a sherwani maybe? You get to wear a trouser and it's a long coat made of luxurious fabric.

It's not as extreme as some other manifestations (look at personal hygiene product marketing) but it is very much the same phenomenon.

But this is your son's wedding, and obviously the traditional Hindu aspects really matter to him, and he wants his dad to be involved. So ask your son or your future in-laws if there are options for traditional wear that include pants underneath if what they've presented doesn't have that option. If you can't seem to find a workaround, then SUCK IT UP and change clothes after the religious ceremony. Again, this is your son's wedding, and this is obviously extremely important to him. So figure out a way to wear the clothes he's asking you to wear because he is getting married to the love of his life, who is trying to bring you into a culture/religion that obviously matters a lot to her.

You can wear the trousers, you will just be attracting unnecessary attraction. As far as I know, wearing a tuxedo will only make you look a \"crow among peacocks\" or \"a huge red pimple on the otherwise nice face\".\n\nWhile many will not care you wore western clothing, they WILL care about if you wear shoes during their wedding ceremony. If you have to be on the stage participating they will demand you to remove shoes as shoes are considered dirty and not to be worn near religious activities. Imagine wearing a tux barefoot. That would be a sight worth seeing. At least the relatives will certainly gossip how the bride's FIL is a racist foreigner, enough for you to overhear and deny when you make a fuss about it.\n\nTheir after-marriage activities don't have a dress code and it is pretty relaxed. You could wear your tux at that time.
