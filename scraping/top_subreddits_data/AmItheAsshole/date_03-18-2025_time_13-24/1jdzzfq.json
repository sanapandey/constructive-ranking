    "selftext": "I just started college this year. ever since i was little, my grandparents set up a college fund for me, and it\u2019s the only reason i can afford school without taking on massive debt. my parents always knew about it, and it was always meant for my education.\n\nrecently, my parents have been struggling financially due to bad investments and overspending. They sat me down and asked me to use my college fund to help them pay off their debts. they said that since they raised me, it\u2019s only fair that i help them now that they\u2019re struggling.\n\ni said no. i told them i was grateful for everything they\u2019ve done, but this money was specifically for my education, and i wasn\u2019t going to throw away my future. they got upset and said i was being selfish and ungrateful. my mom even cried, saying she never thought her own daughter would turn her back on them.\n\nNow my parents barely talk to me. i feel horrible, but at the same time, i don\u2019t think i should have to sacrifice my future because of their financial mistakes.\n\naita for refusing to give up my college fund?",

So what did they do in the past when they got in a bind?  I'm guessing her college money just became available and they put their hands out right away.\n\nThe most she should do for them is to use a bit of that money to get financial management counseling.   Honestly though, I probably wouldn't even do that.  The grandparents had the forethought to realize the parents weren't going to set aside for her college and they took care of it and she should honor their wisdom.",

In case I die beforehand, I have it in my will that eduactional expenses are to be paid directly to the college, trade school, etc. They can get any kind of further education they want--from cosmetology school to a PhD. in astrophysics--and as long as they're in school, their tution will be paid, as well as other living expenses as deemed suitable by the trustee. But if their rent is being paid while they're in college and they move anyone else in with them, it will stop. I want my young family members to have the best chance for success, but I'm not supporting any moochers.",

If they don't change their behavior or circumstances, they'll just be in debt again later.\n\nIf you'd like to help them, then you could \\*consider\\* offering to pay a small amount of rent over the summer while you live with them.  But that's only if you are planning to live with them over the summer anyway.\n\nAnother kind of help that you could offer them, is that you could offer (when you are on break) to help them go over their bills with a fine toothed comb, so you can help them find any and all subscriptions that they have and might want to cancel.  (Rocket Money is one tool that can help, but you can do this yourself as well).  \n\nYou may discover that they are overpaying for phone service, streaming services or other things that would help them to keep their costs down.",

I wanted for nothing when I was young, but my parents squandered every last dime to feed my mother\u2019s shopping addiction. \n\nThey would always come sniffing around when my loan check paid out my tuition and deposited the rest in my checking account. One time, their fridge was on its way out. They asked for $800 for a fridge (a hefty sum 20+ years ago) and I gave it to them. Months later I went home for spring break and lo and behold, they still had the old fridge with an internal temp of around 55 degrees. Where did the money go? Who the fuck knows? \n\nThey ultimately lost everything and went bankrupt. Yours likely will too, whether you help them or not. Keep your head up and make a good life for yourself. There will come a time when you are established in your career and will probably have to help them in some way when they are elderly and sick.

The only thing that will do that is them coming to terms with their financial reality. They should learn to live well within their means and seek out help with debt. There are credit counseling non-profits that do a good job and can help negotiate debt into manageable payments without new high interest consolidation loans. I did that after my divorce a decade ago and it saved me financially.",
