    "selftext": "This is going to be a long one. \nMe (37F) moved out of my country ten years ago, while my father & his part of the family stayed in the country. My sister also lives there with her family. My mom moved with me. \nI am getting married this year and I wanted to have a family wedding that included my dad's side of the family because that's who I grew up with, and I have a lot of fond memories with them and wanted to celebrate. \nMy whole family is not religiously observant, we just do the regular functions (baptisms, first communion) out of Catholic \"tradition\". \n\nMy dad the whole time I've been engaged has been pushing for me to get married in church (hard no for both me and the fiance), then he said we could get married in an civil hall kind of church (also no because we'd like our ceremony to be outside in the open). \nHe helped me find a venue with a really pretty gazebo where they do legal / symbolic ceremonies and that is the place where I will be getting married and having the reception. \n\nI came back today to my country to finalize some things and in the car he tried again asking if I didn't want to get married in church (\"No, thank you, that is not what I want.\") and then at the other civil hall (\"No, we already have a venue and you helped me choose it / find it.\") then he got mad saying my fianc\u00e9 is the one who's pushing these decisions as if I didn't have any individual autonomy.\n\nMy mom is pissed at him and says he can't get over the fact he's not in control, I'm just so fucking tired of this petty argument. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit : the wedding is paid by my fianc\u00e9 and myself, my dad just helped with the initial deposit that I paid him half back for, will pay the other half in May.",

You could even mention that you knew you wouldn't marry in a church before you even met your fiance. Remind him that you are an adult and will make decisions like this for yourself and hope he can find it within himself to respect that, no matter his personal opinion.",

My sister also lives there with her family. My mom moved with me. \nI am getting married this year and I wanted to have a family wedding that included my dad's side of the family because that's who I grew up with, and I have a lot of fond memories with them and wanted to celebrate. \nMy whole family is not religiously observant, we just do the regular functions (baptisms, first communion) out of \"tradition\". \n\nMy dad the whole time I've been engaged has been pushing for me to get married in church (hard no for both me and the fiance), then he said we could get married in an civil hall kind of church (also no because we'd like our ceremony to be outside in the open). \nHe helped me find a venue with a really pretty gazebo where they do legal / symbolic ceremonies and that is the place where I will be getting married and having the reception. \n\nI came back today to my country to finalize some things and in the car he tried again asking if I didn't want to get married in church (\"No, thank you, that is not what I want.\") and then at the other civil hall (\"No, we already have a venue and you helped me choose it / find it.\") then he got mad saying my fianc\u00e9 is the one who's pushing these decisions as if I didn't have any individual autonomy.\n\nMy mom is pissed at him and says he can't get over the fact he's not in control, I'm just so fucking tired of this petty argument. Am I the asshole? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
