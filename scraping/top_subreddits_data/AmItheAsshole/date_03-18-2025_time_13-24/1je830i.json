    "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (37F) are the first to have a baby for both sides of our family. It\u2019s been super fun and we get along grand with everyone in my family and most people in his. Two of his siblings, out of 7, are well, pretty big judgmental assholes. We have unfortunately had to cut off his brother due to him being crazy and accusing us of crazy ass things while doing those things himself (theft and drugs) because god forbid we told him \u201cno\u201d one too many times. His oldest sister has decided she believes the brother and jumped on the accusation shit train with him. \n\nAnyway, now the youngest sibling is getting married and having her reception and small (20-something) dinner at the oldest sister\u2019s house (the one who scorned us). My husband and I love his youngest sister and don\u2019t want to miss her day, but it\u2019s a small event with two people we don\u2019t have in our lives not only being there, but the oldest sister is hosting. We have a 5 month old who will be around 1 year the time of the wedding. He\u2019s the only grandkid and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to bring him, which we can\u2019t decide is an asshole move or not. \n\nI feel like if we bring him we\u2019re giving access to our kid to people we really don\u2019t want in our lives. My MIL loves to take our child and then pass him around as it is and there\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s getting passed to people who treat us like shit. Also, maybe our kid just won\u2019t have a good time there? Like he\u2019ll be bored? But if we don\u2019t take him we\u2019ll be guilted because \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cwedding\u201d. I want to honor my sister in law on her day and she wants us all there, but I don\u2019t want my son to know shitty people just to appease the ones we like. We also don\u2019t want to create more drama by saying no or keep shitty attitudes going by making the youngest feel like we\u2019re involving her in our \u201cdrama\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s the line? Do we just go (the two of us) and not even say anything about our son being babysat leading up to it? Do we let them know in advance? Do we just not go to the wedding at all? I would like to go to show our support but I just don\u2019t want our kid there. Besides, maybe we want to party and not worry about a baby at all, right?! \n\n\n",

Usually we just respond yes to events and the other two siblings, when finding out we\u2019re going choose not to go. The sister likes to host and has invited us to multiple things and we have accepted, just to have her pull the rug on us based on what the brother says. I would say 90% of the time we don\u2019t even know why, just suddenly we\u2019re accused of made up stuff and dropped from invites. The final nail in the sisters coffin for us was when she uninvited us from thanksgiving in 2023 based on the brother. Normally no biggy but it was days before and I had already bought food, told my own family I couldn\u2019t go to their events, and taken off work. That was the last time we chose to be treated so shitty. That event alone split the family as a few relatives thought it was shitty and decided to skip her Thanksgiving. It\u2019s been weird. We have tried to lay low and just not deal with them. \n\nAs for forgiveness, we tried that route, multiple times. They are two very petty people. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s going to be hard but we\u2019re going to have to start saying no and explain we\u2019re not trying to pull anyone into drama, just aren\u2019t interested in dealing with these people anymore.",

It\u2019s been super fun and we get along grand with everyone in my family and most people in his. Two of his siblings, out of 7, are well, pretty big judgmental assholes. We have unfortunately had to cut off his brother due to him being crazy and accusing us of crazy ass things while doing those things himself (theft and drugs) because god forbid we told him \u201cno\u201d one too many times. His oldest sister has decided she believes the brother and jumped on the accusation shit train with him. \n\nAnyway, now the youngest sibling is getting married and having her reception and small (20-something) dinner at the oldest sister\u2019s house (the one who scorned us). My husband and I love his youngest sister and don\u2019t want to miss her day, but it\u2019s a small event with two people we don\u2019t have in our lives not only being there, but the oldest sister is hosting. We have a 5 month old who will be around 1 year the time of the wedding. He\u2019s the only grandkid and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to bring him, which we can\u2019t decide is an asshole move or not. \n\nI feel like if we bring him we\u2019re giving access to our kid to people we really don\u2019t want in our lives. My MIL loves to take our child and then pass him around as it is and there\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s getting passed to people who treat us like shit. Also, maybe our kid just won\u2019t have a good time there? Like he\u2019ll be bored? But if we don\u2019t take him we\u2019ll be guilted because \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cwedding\u201d. I want to honor my sister in law on her day and she wants us all there, but I don\u2019t want my son to know shitty people just to appease the ones we like. We also don\u2019t want to create more drama by saying no or keep shitty attitudes going by making the youngest feel like we\u2019re in loving her in our \u201cdrama\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s the line? Do we just go (the two of us) and not even say anything about our son being babysat leading up to it? Do we let them know in advance? Do we just not go to the wedding at all? I would like to go to show our support but I just don\u2019t want our kid there. Besides, maybe we want to party and not worry about a baby at all, right?! \n\n\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And you\u2019ll also be bringing over a pack n play for naps, toys, bibs, baby food/bottles, spare clothes, 90000 diapers (bc it\u2019s the law of the universe that packing a reasonable number of diapers is how you end up running out of diapers after back-to-back blowouts), and who knows how much space there will be to setup all this stuff.
