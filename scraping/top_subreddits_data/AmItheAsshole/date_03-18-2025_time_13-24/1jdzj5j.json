    "selftext": "My boyfriend and i have been saving up for a while, nothing major, just a small joint fund for things like trips, emergencies, or stuff we both need. we never had strict rules on what it could be used for, but the general understanding was that it was for us, not just one person.\n\nYesterday, i found out he used our savings to buy a ps5. When i asked why he didn\u2019t at least talk to me first, he said it\u2019s \u201cnot just for him\u201d because i can play it too. except\u2026 i don\u2019t play video games at all.\n\ni told him that spending our shared money on something only he wants was selfish, and he got defensive, saying it\u2019s \u201cfor the house\u201d and that i shouldn\u2019t be upset because he \u201cwould\u2019ve let me buy something i wanted too.\u201d i said that\u2019s not the same because i\u2019d never drop our savings on something without asking. And I told him I would reconsider if I would put money on the saving again. \n\nhe\u2019s now acting like im overreacting and says i should just be happy for him since it\u2019s something that makes him happy. He also said most of his friends think \u201cit\u2019s not that serious,\u201d but i feel like it\u2019s a huge breach of trust.\n\naita for arguing this with him??",

Your logic says stay at home moms shouldn't use their husbands money because it's not theirs and they're stealing. You're being too blunt for something that's 100% circumstantial. \n\nYou don't grow a relationship by running away the very first time something happens. You have to grow as a couple and set boundaries. If issues continue, then I'd say to leave. But no one is perfect, and crying so hard that he stole HER money when it's a joint account for things like this, but not necessarily *that* is bad relationship advice. \n\nThe advice I gave in my own comment was that he needs to agree to save up for her to get something of a similar cost, and to talk to him about needing to discuss large purchases for the house in order to maintain a healthy relationship. You're all acting like a PS5 is the end of the world \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if the relationship is over then sure, he should be obligated to pay her back what he spent of her money in the savings. But for now they have the rest of their lives to buy other things, grow their relationship, and learn to make joint decisions.",

He probably knew he didn't have a leg to stand on and on his mind asking forgiveness made more sense, because it is a game console that resides in your shared home and who could object to a little thing like that? \n\nExcept it's not about the console. It's about him using a shared account for anything without asking first. I don't care if he used it to buy a coffee - a shared account is not a personal use account. \n\nThis happened to us early enough our kids were still babies but late enough, our kids existed. Lol \n\nOnly I had gone for groceries assuming I knew what was in the account and had a humiliating experience at the checkout with two kids on my hips and a cartload of food I needed to feed them with ... That I had to watch a bag boy take to restocking. \n\nIn hindsight I'm glad it happened in such a dramatic Sissy Spacek River moment, that by the time I got home empty handed to ask how he paid for his new work boots (also a needed expense) - there was very little I had to say for him to have that ah ha moment. I separated all our accounts after that. Just added up total household expenses and split em down the middle not easy with two kids but easier for me to budget with a bank account of slim pickings I could account for to the penny, as long as he put his half in he could do whatever he wanted with what he had left on his end and I mine. Keeping in mind we would sit down together and agree on household costs he had to make those decisions with me. No way would I be the bad guy for choosing food over whatever. \n\nThis is like a mini version of that I think. \nBut be careful your not over controlling of the shared account too. \n\nThe idea is that it's there for both your uses. But instead of \"how dare you _xyz_ and so on\" just say you'd rather not continue to contribute to an account that isn't going to be there for both of you when the roof needs repairs or you both need a getaway. It's a nice and good concept and figuring what works for both you on this could give you both more tools to negotiate important things like pets, kids homes, school, work, sickness and health. \n\nTry to work it out, this is often a deal breaker for many,  but lessons can be learned and their so much easier to learn for both when the stakes are either a game console or weekend away. \n\nBest way to argue within matrimony or otherwise, is to be clear in understanding what the argument is actually about. \n\nIn this case, he's right the gaming console is not a big deal  (hell, it will be outdated by Christmas,  definitely not something worth a marriage)- him spending anything from a shared account without discussion is.",

It wouldnt just benefit me, it can access streaming services and I could get some multi-player party games for when we have friends over.\" How hard is that? And if you still disagreed and didn't want him to then I would hope he'd be a big enough man to take the L and save up for it himself but the sneakiness has me doubting. Where you are now I would hold off on adding to the savings account until he gets it built back up to where it was and give him a second chance, while communicating that if money is spent here without communication again the account is done, but that's just me.",

Tell him you want to save up to a similar amount so you can get something for yourself to make it fair, and actually pick something that you would love. \n\nAlso, explain to him that it's not that he bought the PS5, it's that he didn't even talk to you about it, and having discussions like that are important for keeping relationships healthy. \n\nIf he continues to spend your SHARED savings on things that only he wants, then I'd definitely be finding a new boyfriend.",
