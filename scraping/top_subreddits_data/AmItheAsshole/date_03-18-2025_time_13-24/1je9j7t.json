    "selftext": "When I (26F) was sixteen, my older brother and I found out our dad had been cheating on our mom with her very close friend. We also found out that it had been going on for years. He gaslighted us about it for a bit, but eventually came clean. Of course, this completely devastated everyone, especially considering at that point, my parents had been married for over 15 years. \n\nIn the end, they decided to work through it. They went to therapy, she forgave him and they stayed together. However, this completely ruined my relationship with him. Up until that point, I thought my dad was the greatest man in the world. He really was my best friend. But after finding out about the affair, I wanted as little to do with him as possible. I moved out at 18, but leading up to that, I avoided him as much as I could. That worked for a while. \n\nNow, it's been over 10 years since it happened and it's starting to create bigger issues in my family. I'm getting married next year to an incredible man, and I'm very excited about it, but my family is upset about me asking my brother to walk me down the aisle instead of asking my father to do it. My mom said he's really hurt by it. \n\nWhich I completely understand and sympathize with, but my father and I haven't been close since his affair. My brother and I became even closer after it, and he was truly my rock during that time, so I want him included in the ceremony. Some of my family members are refusing to come because of this. Calling me bitter, tasteless etc. which is starting to get to me. I invited him to the wedding, he's more than welcome to come, I just do not want him to walk me down the aisle. \n\nI understand people can change, and from what I hear from everyone, my dad did. I think that's amazing and I have no issue with everyone forgiving him. But I just can't. He lied to all of us for years, pretending to be this great man but was cheating on my mom with someone who was like a second mom to us. And I don't want to be associated with someone like that, family or not. \n\nAITA for taking this moment away from my dad? ",

Instead of fostering a lovely home life, spending more time with his wife and/or kids, he choose to create a live (albeit temporarily) with someone else. He chose someone else over his wife *and* his kids. Your mother may have forgiven him for nearly breaking up the family, but you didn't and that's fine. Youre not her. Somehow in all this nonsense, they managed to teach you to stand firm in your beliefs/morals/values/etc. If they don't like that you have those qualities now, that's entirely on them. They don't get to raise you to be a solid individual and then balk when you act like a solid individual. \n\nTheir bafflement is crazy to me. How tf did they assume he'd get this honor when you've not been close in a decade? Did he just bury his head in the sand and assume that since your mother forgave him, everything was totally fine with everyone else?? Did he forget youre your own person and not just an extension of your parents? Either way tho, you not meeting his expectations for your own life is his burden to bear. You're not gonna sacrifice a damn thing for a man that tried to ruin your family. If he has negative feelings about this, he needs to deal with them like an adult, not force the people around him to protect his feefees. Your mom may have signed up for a life of catering to his desires but you sure af did not.\n\n>Some of my family members are refusing to come because of this.\n\nShrug it off. These people weren't worth it in the first place. Use the money you'd have spent feeding them and give yourself some extra play money for your honeymoon. \n\n>Calling me bitter, tasteless etc\n\nShrug it off.

Never mind the fact that walking down the aisle is from the days when daughters were given away, or essentially sold to their husbands. I wouldn\u2019t want someone walking me down the aisle who wasn\u2019t able to keep their vows either. It sets a bad precedent, in my mind.\n\nCheating doesn\u2019t just happen. Cheating is a choice. Taking a marriage vow is also a choice. The meaning of a vow has lost its power in our current society. If you don\u2019t want to be married, don\u2019t get married. You can stay in the relationship without taking a vow. When one chooses to make a vow, you don\u2019t break it. That is a vow.\n\nAll that said, there are consequences to every choice we make. Forgiving your father would be about the relationship between you and him, and hopefully, give you some peace of mind. It took me a long time to understand it, but forgiveness is for you, not them. no one should be trying to force you to have the ceremony in a way that you don\u2019t want. His behavior would taint your memories. Anyone who has their own feelings about it can choose how they respond, but they don\u2019t have the right to make you do what they want.

So when she went to get married, \"ownership\" moved from the father to the husband.  The father \"gave her away\" to another family, literally, and paid someone for the honor of doing so.\n\nDelightful!\n\nNow pretend that times have changed and people have matured and become 'civilized'.  We don't do dowries anymore...though the bride's family is still expected to pay for the privilege of someone marrying their daughter?  Anyway, the 'tradition' of giving the bride away comes from that - women being property and not being entitled to deciding what to do with their own lives.\n\nWhat fun!   **/s**\u221e",

Also relationships we are not part of may look great from the outside but have their cracks which we know nothing about. Have you ever checked to see if there\u2019s a part your mom played? Not saying she did but you weren\u2019t in the therapy session to know. \n\nYou should consider having that heart to heart (that you have probably been avoiding) now before this next chapter of your life. Maybe it\u2019s time to help bring the family back together. Let him hear you out and you hear him out. \n\nFor the record if you still decide to not you won\u2019t be the AH. However it does sound like this is a moment for reconciliation. \n\nAlso sounds like you put your dad on a massive pedestal and you got disappointed completely. He is human.

Here\u2019s my reasoning-\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have been born without your dad and you wouldn\u2019t (as you say) have come through that period without your brother. Both deserve to walk you in that case. Again it\u2019s reasoning and you are free to disagree with it. \n\nAlso your dad like all people made (clearly an error) of which he has made amends for with your mom. If you are looking for amends you wouldn\u2019t get it at a distance. Have you asked why? Also relationships we are not part of may look great from the outside but have their cracks which we know nothing about. Have you ever checked to see if there\u2019s a part your mom played? Not saying she did but you weren\u2019t in the therapy session to know. \n\nYou should consider having that heart to heart (that you have probably been avoiding) now before this next chapter of your life. Maybe it\u2019s time to help bring the family back together. \n\nFor the record if you still decide to not you won\u2019t be the AH. However it does sound like this is a moment for reconciliation. \n\nAlso sounds like you put your dad on a massive pedestal and you got disappointed completely. He is human. There are some things that come out in marriage that many never expect. \n\nJust think about it deeply before you make the final decision.",

OP could be doing the same as me and is seeing a therapist now due to the issues with her extended family related to her wedding. \n\nIt could also be possible that OP didn't go to therapy at first and is only starting to go relatively recently. I know many people who didn't go to see a therapist until years after the inciting incident had happened. \n\nAnd based on what the OP has written, I don't think I'd necessarily classify that as a \"disproportionate impact\". Sometimes when you feel betrayed by someone the love and trust you had for them dies and there is nothing you can do to get it back, even if you want to. That seems like a relatively normal impact to me. And going low contact after that also seems like a relatively normal and appropriate action in that circumstance.

He never offered therapy with you to try to fix things.  You were just supposed to accept your mom was able to move and you should just suck it up.    What I'm hearing is you felt just as betrayed or maybe even more betrayed as a teenager.  You lost more than just your father then.  I say NTA - and if it had mattered he would have tried to make sure you were okay before.",

At the end of the day it's your choice whether you want to learn more and see if you can forgive your father too, esp if he was a good dad and supportive to you as a child. There are always paths to forgiveness and it's totally up to you. Maybe consider when / if you have a child, the relationship you'd want them to have with you if you made a huge mistake, or the relationship you want them to have with their grandpa. \n\nAnyway, NTA. Your choice, your consequences.",

I understand exactly how you are feeling.  My Dad was my favorite person and I've always put him on such a high pedestal. In my mind, he was the definition of a truly great man.\n\nBut he broke my heart into a million pieces when I found out about his affair. It was almost like I had been cheated on too, it cut that deep and I took it that personal.  I couldn't look him in the eye or speak to him for awhile without breaking down.  I sent him the song I had planned to dance with him to at my wedding the night I found out.  I was at a loss for how my wedding would go now.  \n\nI realized, though, I was making the situation about me and that was selfish.  I had to come to terms with the fact that as great as we may perceive our parents to be, they are still human.  They make mistakes, sometimes massive ones. \nHe was still the Dad that has always been there for me, taught me things, supported me, loved me unconditionally and all in all set a damn good example except for that one mistake. \n\nSo I called him and I let him know even though he broke my heart that he'd always be my Dad.  That I was there for him. And I asked him if he was okay, I tried to understand that emotionally he was suffering too.  I gave him grace and I showed him love.  \n\nWe don't truly know what our parents are going through on the inside or the state of their relationship.  Not that anything justifies infidelity and lying, but it wasn't worth losing my father over or ruining the dynamic of our family. \n\nDo what makes you most comfortable for you wedding day. That's YOUR day and no one else should dictate how it goes.\n\nHowever, I agree with therapy around the situation.  And I hope you can find a way to have a good relationship with your father again.  I think it's really important....if its fixable and especially if he's done the work with your mom to do better.",

He took time and effort away from his family to lavish it on someone else, soin a manner of speaking, he was unfaithful to all of them and he lied to all of them. He ruined the role model relationship he had with his kids as a parent and a man of decency. When a person cheats, it affects everyone\u2019s lives, not just the spouse\u2019s. They have every right to be hurt by it. To separate the hurt of the mother from the children is also bizarre. Anyone who hurts my mom, hurts me by default, that\u2019s my damn mom.",

Any good counselor would help you understand that every member of your family was a victim and that you are not wrong in seeing your dad for who he actually is.  1.  He lied to all of you, not just your mom.  2. The lies were deliberate and they were made so that he didn\u2019t get caught - not because he didn\u2019t want to hurt his family - if he was worried about hurting his family, he wouldn\u2019t have carried on a long term affair.  3.  Your mom\u2019s friend actively encouraged and supported this lie, and probably had some secondary gain by getting away with it - that is a cruelty beyond words.  4. He destroyed your concept of your family and you will never be able to return to that reality, because it was based on a series of callous lies and betrayal, and he owns all of it.  People who tell you that if your mom forgave him, it\u2019s over, are simply unwilling to accept your pain.  They want you to go along to get along.  My dad was a serial adulterer and he would deliberately target mom\u2019s friends.  You should absolutely forgive him for your sake, but forgiveness and restoration are two different things. I forgave my dad, but our relationship was quite different after he finally came clean.  I think your compromise is actually quite reasonable.  I would suggest seeing a counselor just to make sure you are being your best version of yourself.  Behavior like your dad\u2019s echoes down generationally and can affect you in ways you might not be aware of.

If she loves him she might take umbrage with you hurting her life partner.\n\nAlso, having been in your situation but as an adult I can tell you that you don\u2019t know what was happening inside your parent\u2019s relationship and you might be judging based on incomplete facts.\n\nIn my case, my mom decided she was done having sex.  For over a year my dad tried to discuss it with her, but she kept saying that she was done and if he wanted to have sex he should find someone else willing to sleep with him.  So ultimately he did.  For about 6 months he had a side piece.\n\nMy mom found out and went nuts.  She immediately demanded everyone side with her.  She ruined his relationship with my siblings and many of his friends.  She dragged his name throughout the community.  She was a force of nature.\n\nI was the only one he told why he did it.  He didn\u2019t want my mom to be looked down on, so he shouldered all the blame when the whole truth was he did exactly what she told him to do.  And when it came public she blamed him.\n\nThey stayed together, though from that point forward he was a beaten man emotionally and sometimes physically.  Shortly thereafter he had a reaction to some medication that slowly started the process that whittled away at his mind.  Three years out he sometimes remembered my name.  \n\nMy sibling found out from me when we were reminiscing at his funeral.  My sister was still so mad at him.  I had assumed she knew, but apparently only I was told (my dad and I were always very close).  She was shocked to hear what really happened (but still thought dad was wrong since my sister is asexual- my dad was definitely NOT).\n\nAs for my mom, I can\u2019t forgive what she did to my dad and how she punished him for something that was her own idea.  She just didn\u2019t think he would actually find a partner.  She absolutely shortened his life from the stress.  I wish they had divorced.  I promised my dad I would look after my mom, so I do.  But i don\u2019t like her.\n\nIf your mom could forgive a long term affair, maybe there was more going on in their relationship than you know about, like with my parents.  Maybe you should be sure before you irrevocably destroy your relationship with your parents.  Ask them both why he did it and why they stayed together.  Assuming your mom actually forgave him, unlike my mom.",

We also found out that it had been going on for years. He gaslighted us about it for a bit, but eventually came clean. Of course, this completely devastated everyone, especially considering at that point, my parents had been married for over 15 years. \n\nIn the end, they decided to work through it. They went to therapy, she forgave him and they stayed together. However, this completely ruined my relationship with him. Up until that point, I thought my dad was the greatest man in the world. He really was my best friend. But after finding out about the affair, I wanted as little to do with him as possible. I moved out at 18, but leading up to that, I avoided him as much as I could. That worked for a while. \n\nNow, it's been over 10 years since it happened and it's starting to create bigger issues in my family. I'm getting married next year to an incredible man, and I'm very excited about it, but my family is upset about me asking my brother to walk me down the aisle instead of asking my father to do it. My mom said he's really hurt by it. \n\nWhich I completely understand and sympathize with, but my father and I haven't been close since his affair. My brother and I became even closer after it, and he was truly my rock during that time, so I want him included in the ceremony. Some of my family members are refusing to come because of this. Calling me bitter, tasteless etc. which is starting to get to me. I invited him to the wedding, he's more than welcome to come, I just do not want him to walk me down the aisle. \n\nI understand people can change, and from what I hear from everyone, my dad did. I think that's amazing and I have no issue with everyone forgiving him. But I just can't. He lied to all of us for years, pretending to be this great man but was cheating on my mom with someone who was like a second mom to us. And I don't want to be associated with someone like that, family or not. \n\nAITA for taking this moment away from my dad? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm so tired of reading about people being called names and pressured because their families think they should get to dictate someone else's wedding. It is your choice who, if anyone, walks down the aisle with you. This is not a right for your father. Some people chose not to do it at all, and others chose someone else than a parent. You feel close to your brother and so, you chose him. Your dad can be hurt about that, and he could decide not to come to the wedding because of that, and so can others. That is fully in their control. But that doesn't make you an A-hole. Your dad is a grown man and can be expected to regulate his own emotions.\n\n\nNow, I agree with others saying that if you feel like you are holding onto lots of anger still, maybe address this for your own sake. Your relationship with your father doesn't have to change at all, this would be something you'd do for yourself.\u00a0\n\n\nThe grown up thing for your father would be to take responsibility for his behaviour and realise that it deeply hurt you and caused a rift, and you don't feel as close to him as a result, and let you have the wedding you want without putting guilt or shame on you. I find it a bit weird that other family members feel the need to insert themselves to such a point anyway.\u00a0",

It is *your* wedding and *your* day. Of course, it's also kind of about your parents, too. Frequently, parents pay for part or all of weddings - not that this justifies anything, but it *is* a dynamic for many people. Parents typically invite many of *their* close friends to show off their hosting skills and of course to share their pride for your big milestone. That doesn't mean they should dictate your wedding, but they are often involved.  \n\nNow here's where I think you fucked up:  \n\n>But after finding out about the affair, I wanted as little to do with him as possible. I moved out at 18, but leading up to that, I avoided him as much as I could. That worked for a while\n\nYou haven't forgiven your dad, but it appears you haven't even tried to repair your relationship as an adult. Your mom forgave him you say, and most of the family is back on board, even to the point that you not asking him to walk you down the aisle is causing them to take sides.\n\nAnd what have you done to try to mend your relationship? Have you given him the grace to apologize to you about how his choices negatively impacted your relationship to him and the family? Have you talked to him about feeling that way, about how it hurts *you* too, and you feel that he at least owes you a sincere apology and effort to make amends? \n\nYou don't mention any of that. Forgiveness and mending is a two-way street, but it appears you closed off your side and shut him out, when others in the family have welcomed him back and tried to move forward. And this is likely felt by other members of the family. \n\nYou're entitled to whatever decisions you feel strongly about. You don't have to forgive your dad. But when everyone else seems to have forgiven him, and you haven't even tried to get to know him again and share how you feel, then you are, indeed, TA.",
