He's the opener.\n\nI asked my boss if I could adjust the space that works for me. I've worked in a pizza place making pies. So we have the ovens on the wall and a table for things to land. They keep the serving dishes next to the line but a lot of times it's hard to reach because they stack boxes there and if you don't prepare in time you have to make an awkward movement. So I took maybe \u00bc of the stack and moved the bin under the table to catch hot pizza trays to the lower shelf and put the dishes on the middles. This way I wouldn't have to turn around to grab one if I forgot or didn't have time.\n\nAs soon as he noticed, he was complaining loudly. I asked if that bothered him and he shouted at me saying yes, it does bother him. He was visibly upset and moved everything back. He definitely complained to the boss about that. I only work with him one day a week and I'm the closer so I can run a station and he thinks he needs to help me, because I'm the new guy. ",
