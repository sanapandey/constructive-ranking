    "selftext": "My best friend [24F] we\u2019ll call her may, and I [24F] have been close since middle school. We\u2019ve talked about being in each others weddings, so when she got engaged last year, i assumed I\u2019d be a bridesmaid.\n\nShe recently asked me to help with the wedding planning, but when she showed me the list for her bridal party, I wasn\u2019t on the list. I asked why, and she got awkward and said she had to make some choices. The party included her sister, her fianc\u00e9s sister, and a few newer friends she\u2019s known for a couple of years. She wanted a small party. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to make it a big deal though. I congratulated her and figured I\u2019d still be a guest. But then she started asking me for a lot of help, things like dress shopping, DIY decorations, venue hunting, making party favors, etc etc..\n\nI finally told her, \u201cHey, I love you, but I feel weird doing all of this when I\u2019m not even a bridesmaid.\u201d She got angry and said that she thought I\u2019d still want to be involved because we\u2019re best friends. I told her I\u2019d still be at the wedding, but I wasn\u2019t gonna do all of this extra work when she didn\u2019t even consider me close enough to be at her bridal party. \n\nNow she and some of our mutual friends are giving me the cold shoulder, saying I\u2019m being petty and making the wedding \u201cabout me.\u201d But I\u2019m not gonna be doing bridesmaid-level work if I\u2019m not one. AITA???",

She wants free labor from you. She's trying to enlist your help because her bridesmaids probably have either already said no (even though that's their job) or because she doesn't want to burden them with the menial tasks she wants to dump on you.  \n\nThat she got angry when you stood up for yourselves speaks volumes. Good on you for not letting her use you.",

This girl and a couple of mutual friends was asked to be the bridemaids for a bride ( they all were college buddies). So these girls travelled (at their own expense) to the bride's hometown. Once they arrived, they were immediately put to work by the bride's family. ( cooking, decorating right to the wedding day). On the day of the wedding they also found out that the bride have already have another group as bridemaids. It is then they found out that they were tricked by the bride to become 'brideslaves'. Needless to say, they were fuming and left for home during the event and go NC with the bride..",

Those of us who were chosen felt bad for our left out friend and kind of ganged up on the bride and threatened to bail. She relented and guess what? Our chunky gal pal lost a LOT of weight, got a makeover, and nearly outshined us all! She's kept the weight off, too, and we're all still pals. I've heard lots of stories of brides leaving out close friends who didn't have the right \"look,\" or were a different race, or were pregnant.",

Hunting for venues and providing decorations are jobs for a paid wedding planner, if the marrying couple doesn't want to do those things themselves. Saying its the \"job\" of the wedding party (and notice it's 99% of the time only the female members of the wedding party; no one is demanding that their groomsmen provide hand-made centerpieces) is some shit people make up so they can try to have weddings they can't really afford, and it's not actually any different from charging admission.

It is very possible that she doesn't feel you'd mesh that well with her new friends. That makes HER suck, not you. You have every right to step back from having to do all her bidding. And if anybody says anything to you about it, just remind them that there are several others in her wedding party that should support the bride. \n\nWhen my sister married my brother-in-law, I was excluded from the wedding party. She referred to me as her personal attendant, which was her way of getting me to do all the work but not be included in the wedding itself.\n\nI figured at the very least I'd be named in the wedding program. Nope. Nothing. I did all the running, babysat her kids during the whole ceremony, helped decorate and clean up, and even took her kids while she went on her honeymoon. When the pictures were taken, she created her wedding album from her favorites. I wasn't in a single one. It was then that I realized we just weren't very close.\n\nI was very bothered by it, I'll admit. But when I got married, I excluded her from my wedding party. Of course, I married at city hall, so it wasn't that blatant. However, I was conversing with my sister and cousin one time about ten years ago during cousin's bridal shower. She asked about my sister's wedding, and I just answered, \"Oh, no. We're not very close at all.\" My sister's mouth dropped open (I have only one sister). \"Yes, we are!\" I turned and looked at her, \"Um, no. If life gives me hardships, you'd be the last person I'd look to for a shoulder. You don't even know who I am.\" \n\nSince then, she's changed. She's worked HARD for it, too.

I\u2019m really happy that your sister took these words to heart and that she was willing to do the work to earn your trust and to build a better sibling relationship! That said, I am jealous.\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to assure other people that my sister and I \u201caren\u2019t close,\u201d I definitely think those kinds of things to myself, and/or will verbalize it in front of my husband and in-laws. She was my Maid of Honor when I got married, but she didn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d anything or plan anything for me\u2014not even a toast/speech! Her excuse is that \u201cshe was young,\u201d (which she was\u2014we BOTH were, really), but when she went OFF on me (unprovoked, I might add) bc our dad couldn\u2019t afford to give her as much money as he\u2019d given me for my wedding, she ERUPTED at me and called me an \u201cageist\u201d when I calmly tried to point out that a) his financial situation was very different around the time I got married (16 years ago) bc his business was thriving and he knew that my mom could not afford to help me at all, and b) no one was obligated to give her money at all, however, our poor dad *absolutely would have* given her more if he could afford to, c) I was a poor early 20\u2019s year old when I got married\u2014and while my husband and I contributed a lot of our own money and took out a small loan to help pay for it, her situation was completely different. SHE and her fianc\u00e9/husband were more stable and financially healthy at 35+ years old, because they\u2019d waited to get married until they were older. Our mom\u2019s financial situation had improved and she could afford to help pay for things (which made me happy for her, truly) , and my sister and her husband already owned a home together and had pretty significant savings and investments for their age. \n\nI *was* in her bridal party, however, I was excluded from every single bridal/bridesmaid event and was passive-aggressively shooed away when I attempted to give a speech/toast at her wedding. I didn\u2019t confront her about this or say anything at the time, but it was extremely hurtful and she has kind of always excluded me from plans of hers, where I have typically included her. Anytime I\u2019ve been included, we had a great time and I vibed well with her and her friends\u2026.\n\nI\u2019m not perfect, but all I\u2019ve ever wanted is for us to be close. When we *do* hang out, we usually have fun together and I can tell that she does love me. She loves my children and does make some effort there. She consistently bails on any plans we make together, or if I try to make plans with her, will give the excuse that she already has plans and that I \u201cneed to plan ahead at least 3-4 weeks in advance\u201d (sometimes I can, but I also have young children and it can be hard to plan ahead any more than maybe a couple of days to a week out, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) OR will say that she\u2019s tired and wants to just chill,\u201d\u2014even if I offer to come to her house and we can just watch Netflix or something and order takeout. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to talk to her about it and about all kinds of different examples of where this has happened, but we are never allowed to discuss anything and she\u2019ll shut it down or accuse me of being dramatic or argumentative. I\u2019ve suggested that we go to therapy together, but she always has a reason why now isn\u2019t a good time. Truthfully, she HAS had some scary health stuff going on for the last few years, which is a big reason why I haven\u2019t pushed it, but this kind of behavior isn\u2019t new . I find myself really emotionally distancing myself from her and have stopped trying to make plans with her, since I always end up disappointed and I don\u2019t want to be resentful.\n\nDamn\u2026This post got waaaaaayyy longer than I intended it to. My bad. Guess I\u2019m still pretty raw about it.\n\nEdited: to water down some specific details to make it more vague and not as identifiable \ud83d\ude2c",

That is, if I could even get that far without her shutting it down.\n\nI could live with us not being super close, but it\u2019s hard to have a relationship with someone who refuses to take responsibility for her part in things, as I myself have taken responsibility for my parts. \n\nHer entire life, she\u2019s refused to face ANYTHING that\u2019s remotely uncomfortable or unpleasant unless backed into a corner and forced to, and her MO is to just bury it and let it be. I\u2019m just tired of all the gaslighting (it\u2019s probably more accurate to call it \u2018deeply rooted denial\u2019) and lies.",

I recently saw a post where the bride didn't even invite her supposedly dearest friend to the wedding at all, claiming she had a small guest list and had to make difficult choices. But people who made the cut and attended the wedding were plus 1's the bride and groom didn't know, neighbors, friends of friends and some other distant acquaintances. I bet if you really examine your friendship, you will find evidence that your friend appreciates how useful you can be but doesn't really value you as a friend. Especislly since the bride has a couple of bridesmaids that she's only known about 2 years. Clearly, their friendship is more important to her than the friendship with you.\n\nI'm petty. I would probably help with the arrangements as requested, being careful not to spend a dime of my own money. I would attend the wedding. In a very appropriate way, I would tell as many other guests as I could in detail about all the work I did for \"my best friend's\" wedding. Hopefully some guests might start wondering allowed why I'm not a bridesmaid. I would try to be in as many photos as I could. If allowed, I would give a heartfelt speech during the reception. After the wedding, I would ghost the bride because she doesn't consider me to be an important person in her life, much less a best friend. I would get satisfaction knowing she would forever see me in her wedding photos and videos. If she has any sense of shame at all, maybe she will cringe every time she thinks about how much work I did for her wedding. Of course the other possible outcome is that she breathes a sigh of relief that I'm no longer in her life but truly regrets I won't be doing stuff for her in the future.",

Then, I heard her conversing with one of the bridesmaid asking who I was. She just LAUGHED and said, she felt sorry for me, so she made me do her errands. So, I left the wedding and decided to go hang with my real friends. The Bridal party ended up going to a club (she went with her new husband) to which she started bitching me out for leaving her in the \"lurch\". I just looked at her and told her, true friends wouldn't treat each other the way she has treated me. Later on one of the bridesmaids I was also friends with came over and told me EVERYTHING that the bride had said. I just shrugged my shoulders and said, \"Not my problem anymore.\" I haven't talked to the bride since that night, nor do I help with weddings unless I am IN them.

We\u2019ve talked about being in each others weddings, so when she got engaged last year, i assumed I\u2019d be a bridesmaid.\n\nShe recently asked me to help with the wedding planning, but when she showed me the list for her bridal party, I wasn\u2019t on the list. I asked why, and she got awkward and said she had to make some choices. The party included her sister, her fianc\u00e9s sister, and a few newer friends she\u2019s known for a couple of years. She wanted a small party. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to make it a big deal though. I congratulated her and figured I\u2019d still be a guest. But then she started asking me for a lot of help, things like dress shopping, DIY decorations, venue hunting, making party favors, etc etc..\n\nI finally told her, \u201cHey, I love you, but I feel weird doing all of this when I\u2019m not even a bridesmaid.\u201d She got angry and said that she thought I\u2019d still want to be involved because we\u2019re best friends. I told her I\u2019d still be at the wedding, but I wasn\u2019t gonna do all of this extra work when she didn\u2019t even consider me close enough to be at her bridal party. \n\nNow she and some of our mutual friends are giving me the cold shoulder, saying I\u2019m being petty and making the wedding \u201cabout me.\u201d But I\u2019m not gonna be doing bridesmaid-level work if I\u2019m not one.

This is understandable.  You did the adult thing and talked about it with them, they gave you some reasons, it didn't really resolve your feelings, and you decided not to push it, because it's your friends big day.  So far so good.\n\nBut then your friend still involved you a whole bunch in the wedding, which presumably you would have been excited to do if you were in the wedding party, but now that you aren't, it makes you less excited.\n\nThat put you in an awkward position,  you didn't want to put your feelings above your friends, but you also were having trouble aside your feelings as your involvement grew.\n\nSo you had two choices, either: \n\nA) find a way to /politely/ decline more work while sparing your friends feelings.  Something like 'i'm feeling really overwhelmed with school/work/X these days, and I can't help out as much as I'd like'.\n\nB) find a way to talk to your friend about your feelings, tell her that you are really excited about her wedding, and that you would like to help out with this stuff, but you also feel ackward because you aren't in the wedding party, can we talk a bit more about my feelings, and how I can feel more included/recognized\n\nIt seems like you tried option B, but it didn't go as well as you would have liked.  I think that's because of the way you framed it, she probably felt like you were trying to rehash her decision about bridesmaids and punish her for it, which you claim you didn't want to do.",

I was best friends with a girl from 5th grade on. We were together all the time, and my family pretty much considered her another daughter. She went on family vacations with us for years. She went to college out of state, but we still kept in touch. Randomly called me one day and asked if I would be upset if I wasn\u2019t in her wedding. Blindsided and put on the spot, I said no. Similar to your situation, her bridesmaids ending up being partners of the groomsmen. She said she would want me to be with her when getting ready on the big day. As the wedding approached, I helped with a couple of things but not much. I did attend the wedding, but we hardly interacted at the reception. I don\u2019t think we talked again after the wedding. Looking back at our friendship, I realized she wasn\u2019t a very good friend after all. \n\nAll this to say, you have every right to feel upset and angry.

It's supposed to be a celebration of a milestone event, not a \"demand performance\".  Even dress shopping is traditionally a task where the bride's family and bridal party help.\n\nBut certainly, when you aren't a close enough friend to be part of the wedding party, it rather looks as though May only values you as free labor.\n\nYou may need to look at the friendship.

The fact that she included newer friends and excluded you tells you how she really feels about your friendship. But she still wants to use your labor. Hard pass. \n\nWhen I got married, I automatically had my sister, my sister-in-law and my husband's sister. And then my husband had our brothers/brother-in-law. But then the parties were uneven so I had my 2 good friends. It was a big wedding party but I loved having them all involved. I had my 2 lifelong friends. It would have been a slap in the face not to have them or to choose new friends over them, I could never. I was, however, grateful that my sister was automatic MOH so I didn't have to choose between friends. But what your \"friend\" did is shitty.\n\n> she thought I\u2019d still want to be involved because we\u2019re best friends\n\nIf she considered you a best friend, you'd be in the party. NTA. I don't get it, why can't her actual bridesmaids do it?",

            "body": "NTA.  You have done nothing wrong by standing up for yourself and pointing out the obvious disparity between the way the bride is treating you and her expectations.  It's one thing to be looked over as a bridesmaid instead of friends who have less history than you, it's another to ask a guest to pick up the slack on wedding tasks.  If she thinks her bridesmaids are incapable of helping her why were they chosen in the first place?\n\nI would seriously reconsider the friendship.  At least take a step back and ask yourself if the bride has a history of expecting your support without reciprocating.  It would be surprising if this was a once-off, especially since she feels so entitled to your time and energy that she has set mutual friends against you.  It seems to me that the bride thinks so little of your boundaries that she sees nothing wrong with recruiting your friends to pressure you into doing her bidding.\n\nIt may be worth it to speak to those mutual friends privately to see what story she is telling them.  She may be putting a negative spin on what happened.  I'm inclined to think this is what is going on because it seems ridiculous that your friends expect you, as a WEDDING GUEST, to do the tasks of a BRIDESMAID after not being chosen for the position.\n\nIf it turns out they know the full story and are still taking her side, forward them a list of tasks the bride tried to give you and let them know you will be informing her that they are offering their services.  If your mutual friends feel so strongly that the bride's friends should be helping let them help her.  See who steps up and who is a hypocrite.\n\nRegardless, if I were you I would NOT be going to the wedding unless this gets resolved.  If you're already getting flack from your FRIENDS imagine how hostile the ACTUAL BRIDESMAIDS will be.  I don't imagine they will be very happy to see you if they end up having to do their jobs because you had the nerve to advocate for yourself.  Not to mention that if the bride feels comfortable talking badly about you to mutual friends, I'd imagine she is also freely share her issues with you with her family and the other guests.  Will you be able to happily celebrate with the bride if she is still feeling resentful?  I doubt it.  Save yourself the drama.\n\nGood luck and stay strong OP.",

My \u201cfriend\u201d (no longer friends) who used to call me sister, spent almost every day together, got really close etc. etc. was getting married. I never got an invite to be a bridesmaid even though she would always talk about me being maid of honor (I didn\u2019t need to be MoH, bridesmaid would have been fine. She has no sisters). INSTEAD- she asked me to do her wedding makeup and hair FOR FREE, as well as her bachelorette party/weekend. I obliged because I am a people pleaser and just dumb I guess. Day of the wedding (this was middle of July- it was 104\u00b0 F that day) and when I arrived she made my bf (now husband) go SET UP THE WEDDING CHAIRS outside, while he was in a black vest/tux thing (idk men\u2019s fashion), and instead of doing just my \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d hair and makeup I ended up having to do ALL 13 OF HER BRIDESMAIDS HAIR AND MAKEUP. I wanted to cry and looking back I wish I had the strength and confidence I do now to have just walked out. I again obliged because I\u2019m a dumbass. I felt so used. Even the bachelorette weekend I was ignored and left out. It was such a slap in the face. Some of the bridesmaids were friends she made literally a couple of months before the wedding. Anyway (I\u2019m a hairdresser) and while I was working on another girls\u2019 hair, one particular bitchy bridesmaid had taken my expensive af curling iron and tried curling her hair. Bitch had fake extensions so they melted to my iron and effectively ruined it (at least she ruined her hair too). Bitch also stole some of my makeup. After I had finished, she went to go to pictures outside. I was exhausted and just wanted to go sit down, drink water, and be with my bf. She got mad and made me walk around with her in case she needed a \u201ctouch up\u201d. Every wedding I had ever worked once I was done I was done. I know how to apply professional makeup and it STAYS until you take it off. Usually I provided a little bag with the lipstick/gloss and other essentials or personalized shadows if they needed through the night. I walked back halfway through her photoshoot. She never even wanted to take a picture with me, her guest and friend but whatever. Wedding was horrible. We sat at her husband\u2019s extended family table. They were awful. Towards the end of the night the uncle literally \u201cdropped\u201d his lemonade on me and the dress (he did it on purpose). My bf and I walked out after that. Worst wedding of my life. Needless to say I never spoke to her again. \n\nMoral of the story: don\u2019t feel bad, you\u2019re not an asshole you are someone with common sense and self respect. Don\u2019t be dumb like me.",

My best friend asked me to be a bridesmaid but she sat me down and said she would happily make me MoH but knew I probably wouldn't be comfortable with all the work that goes into it. Doubly so since she was older than me and got married young, and I'd only been to one wedding in my entire life at that point, so I would have had no idea what to do.\n\nShe might be your best friend, but you are not her best friend. She doesn't respect you. \"I thought you'd want to be involved\" is BS. Yeah, you might still want to be involved with the fun stuff, not the stressful work stuff. It'd be one thing if there was an actual reason you COULDN'T be a bridesmaid, but this is an arbitrary line she drew up and she doesn't respect you enough to include you.",

When she got engaged, I was the first person to know (besides her parents/siblings). Ever since we were little, we'd shared our dream wedding ideas with each other and so while she didn't ask me to be a bridesmaid or maid of honour, she and I had the best time obsessing over wedding things together. I helped her with so many things and in different capacities - some things she and her fiance were happy for me to research, if I wanted to and had time, like the limo company that would give them the best value, that sort of thing. For other things I was a sounding board, like they couldn't decide on colours and her fianc\u00e9 suggested she see what I thought, so we threw around some ideas together over a few coffees.  \n\nIt went like that for months in the lead up to their wedding day. But let's be real - I couldn't always help because of my other job/other commitments at the time, but we are that close that I was able to communicate that to her and she never minded if I wasn't available or present.  \n\nI attended their beautiful big day as a guest, and it was one of the most fun and amazing days of my (and their!) life. It was kind of better that way, I didn't have to worry about making sure her dress was fluffed or her veil was straight during the ceremony, or making sure Uncle Alan didn't get his hands on the microphone during the reception, etc. While I wasn't up there with her for their vows, I was still able to truly witness and enjoy seeing my best friend marry the love of her life, and for that I will always be grateful.  \n\nI didn't do all that stuff for her because I was a bridesmaid. I did it all because of my love for her.  \n\nMaybe take a look at your friendship and see if it's really worth throwing away just because you didn't get the 'job title'.",

Similar thing happened to me except instead of being left out of being a bridesmaid, I was left out of the wedding invites altogether. Yet I was expected to still attend a wedding shower and purchase a gift.\u00a0 I didn't find out I wasn't invited until after the wedding shower, and in a deceptive shady way, where I was strung along and fed an excuse with no recourse or retraction. It literally ended my friendship with this family member, and not even on my end or by my choosing. \ud83d\ude1e. (I was asking my BFF in confidence about this situation by text in real time while it was all unfolding in a text convo with this cousin, and accidentally sent a text meant for my BFF to said cousin by fluke mistake, the text wasn't even anything profane or mean just revealing that I thought I was being excluded from the invites along with the evidence why I felt this way. Apparently my cousin flipped out when she got my accidental text, responded very curtly \"yup, not invited at all\", cursed me out after that, then proclaimed she was blocking my number.) Even worse, my own immediate family didn't care about this cousin's selfishness and still all went to the wedding even though they admitted that what she did was mean and wrong to me, and even though they weren't even close to her and even though the wedding was in the downtown of the big city that they usually like to avoid going into. The whole experience literally ruined the bonds I was trying to form/reform with a family I never really felt accepted by. I'm still not recovered from it bond -wise and actually, this post has me realizing I'm still not over it.\n\n\nI won't be over it until I get married and pregnant myself like she did, and get to have family fawning over me too like they've done for literally every other female in our extended family, all who got married by now before me (that's another point of resentment, her total hypocrisy about getting pregnant out of wedlock, she slammed me and first ended our friendship months earlier when I confused in her my desire to get pregnant with a sperm clinic and artificial insemination, judging me for trying to have a baby out of wedlock, only for her to then willfully conceive a baby with her boyfriend before they even got engaged, only a few months later. By the time she got engaged and planned her wedding, she was already pregnant with her first of now 2 kids. \ud83d\ude21)",

If the reasons she gave you for not inviting you don't sound true, trust your gut. But, I would weigh several things. How much do you still value this friendship, given her current behavior? Have the two of you grown apart since high school, moved on with new friends and interests? It might be time to recalibrate this relationship.

You standing up for yourself here is great, but you have upset the expectations that this bride, and apparently others, had for you.  They are A-holes ONLY for expecting this of you and giving you attitude when you do not participate.  Asking for your help is not the issue.\n\nI do think your answer was a bit too honest.  It does sound petty, like you're trying to penalize the bride for not including you.  You could have saved yourself a lot of trouble here by just being busy a lot, but that honesty is not A-holery.  It is true that she has friends in the bridal party who should be the main accomplices for these things.  She can still ASK you, that needs to be clear, but your responsibility for the wedding is nil, besides showing up with a gift, unless you're in the bridal party.  Could you have said yes?  You could have, and it certainly would have been the nicer option, but you were invited as a guest, and not as a supporter, and those distinctions can matter to people.  They obviously matter to you, and frankly, they would matter to me too.\n\nThe first question here is why does she need you here and where are her new friends in helping out?  The second question is that if she expected to need you without you being in the bridal party, why didn't she come to you and say that.  There is a path here where you are not in the bridal party, but part of a support team that fills a similar role, and it's all good because you are INVITED and not EXPECTED to do it.  One is a request of a friend, and the other is entitlement, and the latter is where your friend falls.\n\nFour (or more?) people is not a small bridal party, but two of those slots, sister and SIL are must-haves.  So there aren't four slots to fill, but two.  Having SIL as a bridesmaid is also going to be awkward, because they may not be close and SIL may not actually be close enough to be helpful with the planning stuff.  But you're not wrong that not being invited to be in the bridal party removes any responsibility for stuff.\n\nBUT... your friend the bride, and from the sounds of it, some other people (are these the new-friend-bridesmaids?) are looking down on you for not participating.  They obviously expected your help here, and the long and close friendship with the bride is probably why.  It's also why you expected to be in the running for bridesmaid, but it might have been a close race, or not close, or whatever.  End result, you're not in the bridal party, but the bride hopes you are a close enough friend that she can impose on.  If that was how it was worded, I would have called you the A-hole.  Up to this point, the bride is not the A-hole.  She had two slots on the list for bridal party and three friends to pick from.  It happens.  Getting that wedding together is a lot of work and the friendly thing to do is to help out, especially because other occasions to hang out are going to be limited now.  \n\nBut given the sense of entitlement the bride has to your time, based on your description of the matter, it could also be that the reason you lost out on the bridal party is that she figured she could make you help anyway, which is a terrible look for her.\n\nLacking context, we can only go with the facts.  If she wants you to feel responsible for the wedding, she needs to give you responsibility and place in the party.  Otherwise, she's just asking for favours, and not nicely.",
