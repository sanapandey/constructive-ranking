You're assuming she's going to make things cramped, but unless your sister has a history of not being a good roommate you're already going for the worst-case scenario. An internship means she's probably going to be well locked into her job during the day and who knows maybe she has an active social life and might be doing stuff out after work hours. Maybe your parents are right, and she'll just need a room to sleep in. It does suck, for lack of a better word, to have someone in your face screaming at you, but your parents technically do get some control in this situation since its their house. They're the ones paying the rent. Stop using your baby as an excuse. There are people with even less space who raise well-adjusted kids. Think of the opportunity this could be: your sister is making internship money so if she'd be interested maybe you can pay her to babysit on a Friday or Saturday night then you can your husband can have a date night? If you really can't stand the idea of your sister living there, then yeah, you're going to have to start paying rent. It's a privilege to be able to live rent free, you've been very lucky, and your parents could decide to kick you out at any time. Just think about that.",

Anywhere else you\u2019d have had to pay rent. Rent is not unreasonable. You\u2019ve said you\u2019re 1-2 mo away from your own space. How long have you been in this space? 1 yr? 2 yrs?  Your sister needs a place to crash, and your parents have one for her. This is not your home, no matter how long you\u2019ve been there. \n\nSo. Different perspective. You got use of their space for 365-730 days (1-2 yrs), and your sister will share with you for 20-40 days (5 days x4-8 weeks). This is not unreasonable. Yes, routines will need to adjust. Baby will need to play in your room or living room. Baby will be fine for 20 days.\n\nETA: if you were paying rent/mortgage, my response would be different. Then it is your space, and no they shouldn\u2019t be able to force another tenant with you. The fact is you aren\u2019t. So you\u2019re not entitled to its exclusive use.",

We've been actively looking to buy our own place to gain independence. Suddenly, my parents decided that either we start paying rent or we let my sister move in with us.  \n\nNow, my sister just got an internship (500\u20ac/month) in a town that\u2019s easier to reach from our place, but she never asked if we'd be okay with her staying here. My parents are acting like she\u2019d be \"just sleeping there\" and wouldn't be a burden, but let\u2019s be real\u2014she\u2019d be living here five nights a week, using our space, utilities, and making our already tight home even more cramped (especially with a baby who needs space).  \n\nTo make things worse, they\u2019re now guilt-tripping us by saying that we \"owe\" them because they let us stay here rent-free, and they\u2019re comparing it to my husband's parents, who never gave us a house but will likely help us in other ways. Also, my mom got in my face screaming during an argument about this, which was super unsettling.  \n\nMy dad? He stirred up this whole thing and then conveniently left my mom and sister to deal with me.  \n\nI feel like they\u2019re trying to control me through \u201chelp\u201d and then making me pay for it later. And now I\u2019m wondering if I should even let them be involved with my daughter since they clearly don\u2019t respect her father (or our boundaries).  \n\nAITA for refusing to let my sister move in and pushing back against my parents?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But when you offer to let someone move into your house, you are entering a legal agreement, even if it's only a verbal agreement and no money is exchanging hands. Once someone has received mail at an address for 90 days, they become a legal resident. **In the eyes of the law, the parents are landlords and OP and her family are residents, with all the legal protections that entails.**\n\nSo OP may not be on the deed, but it's still her home and it should be treated as such. She has every right not to have a roommate forced on her. Of course, equally, her parents have every right to change the terms of their agreement and start demanding rent.\n\nBut all legalities aside, this sub is \"am I the asshole,\" not, \"is this technically legal.\" And the parents are the ones being assholes. **Offering the free use of a house is a wonderful gift, but a gift is not really a gift if after accepting it, you find there are strings attached or it's held over your head.**\n\nOP, you are NTA. \n\nWhile it's true you aren't entitled to the house, or free rent, you are entitled to basic respect. Your parents are within their rights to ASK that you let your sister move in, but they did not discuss this with you, they gave you an ultimatum. They've steamrolled over your very reasonable boundaries and put you in a difficult position. Unfortunately, your instincts about the controlling nature of what they're doing are probably spot on. If you give in, you'll be setting a precedent you'll have a hard time escaping. At this point, even agreeing to pay rent is a trap, because they'll hold that over you too, or just move the goalposts. I'd start looking for apartments ASAP.",

Don't bite the hand that feeds you.\n\nYta. According to your post, you sound very entitled and you are acting as if your parents handing you a place to live on a silver platter is somehow owed to you and that they are out of line for also saying your sister can live there too. If you don't want that to happen then get your own place. It's common sense. If it's not \"that simple\" than suck it up and coexist with your sister until you can find your own place. This isn't your house, nor your call. Your baby will be fine.",

If it isn't worth the amount they are asking for, then it's time to go rent another place elsewhere. I hate it when family \"helps\" us to CONTROL us. Then after you are bent every which way due to their controlling ways, they demand payment. So it was never help. It was a way to control you. And by not doing what they say, the help is suddenly withdrawn and it's business for them. IMO it's gonna be best to save up and start packing to move out away from their control. The faster you do this the faster your relationship can be repaired, the faster your life goes back to being controlled by yourself and the better you will be in the long run. I can see both sides of this too. It sucks to live with an adult sister yes. But your parents are also not trying to pull favorites either here. Either y'all can share it equally, or you can pay rent so they can provide your sister a place to stay as they do for you. Both sides have valid points here. I would find out if the rent would be worth it, and either move out and get your own place or continue the free ride with your sister included. That's fair to me looking at it as a mom.",

This is a toughie. ~I'm gonna be an oddball and go with NAH.~ Since it's your parents' house, they /do/ have the right to change the arrangements however they please. It looks like it has always been understood between both parties that this home was a LOAN, not a gift, and that the living arrangement would be temporary. Because you were aware of those two factors, you don't have much of a leg to stand on. They're not even technically taking it away, they just want to help your sister as well. That being said, you deserve a real conversion where both sides listen to the other and take each other seriously. While technically legal, it is jarring and unkind of your parents to suddenly drop an ultimatum like this on you. They should have given you time to think about it and find other living arrangements if that's what you want. This is your home, even if you don't own it, and at the very very least, you need time to review and adjust your expectations, budget, etc. \n\nI understand it can feel like help is conditional or transactional, but because this was never meant to be a gift, it's fair and appropriate for your parents to want to \"take it back.\" Try to keep in mind that you are lucky to have this support. \n\nI'm also curious about your finances and how long you've been living there. Personally, if my family could live somewhere rent free, even for just a few months, we would have a MASSIVE savings account. Buying a house is very difficult right now, but it's possible. ~Look into USDA Rural development. That's how we bought our house, and we didn't have to pay a penny in closing costs or down payment (we did pay out of pocket for inspection and appraisal though.)~  I just think it's a little strange to have been living somewhere for free and still not have anything saved up, unless one or both of you aren't working.\n\nEdit 1: Oops, wasn't paying attention to location. USDA isn't an option outside the US.",
