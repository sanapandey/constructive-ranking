    "selftext": "So I have a bachelor party for my friend In Vegas next weekend I\u2019ve been very excited about it. Today we were told the price of it all and it was a bit confusing and seemed overpriced \n\nOne of the groomsmen works as a bachelor party planner in Vegas and told us he got us good deals yet according to his close friend not only is he not paying at all to come with but he is making a profit\u2026\n\nAfter hearing this I\u2019m considering opting out of the bachelor party. I am also involved in entertainment planning industry and would never profit off my best friends or use a bachelor party as an opportunity for that. \n\nI recently planned a bachelor party that happened a month ago with the same exact group of friends and I spend weeks planning putting in so much work and we all spilt everything evenly. I thought it\u2019s what you do for your close friend when they ask you to help plan vs using it as an opportunity \n\nAm I wrong here? Should we all be paying for him? Am I an asshole if I call him out and don\u2019t  go on the principle of this is wrong to do to your friends ?",

He should be paying his fair share too and he shouldn't be making any money off of it unless he was hired to do this as part of his job and even still je should have to pay his own way and not have everyone else paying to cover his share. I think you should make a group chat and call him out in front of the groom and everyone else attending. Ask him why the price is the way it is. Ask him to see where it comes up with the total price and show you that he is splitting the cost evenly between all the people going.     \nOr in the group chat you send a message that says, \"Hey everyone I just wanted to let you know that due to some outrageous new info that has been brought to my attention about the bach party I am no longer willing to join so I will be canceling. To the groom, I'm really sorry buddy. I wish this were something that I could overlook and just go along with to celebrate you, but I just can't. I'm surprised that everyone else was okay and agreed with it. To the man robbing his \"friends\" do you need my info to go ahead and send my refund to me right now?",

She\u2019s a \u201ctravel agent\u201d and had been trying to get all the girls to do a girls trip because she can get such incredible discounts. Eventually they decided to do 4 night trip to Cancun. My wife was pregnant at the the time but only a few months and another one of the girls had an 8 month old so they said no promises but they would look into it and if they felt they could make it work they would go. So the girl started \u201cplanning\u201d the trip sent over the plans. \n\nIt was 4 nights at a nice looking place with flights. It wasn\u2019t all inclusive or anything just hotel and flights, for $2,200 each. I thought that sounded high so looked up the hotel and flights on my own and it was $1,200. So my wife called her and asked her what else was included, and why it was so much and she just said that\u2019s what it costs. One of the other girls called my wife and asked her what she thought because she looked it up and found it a lot cheaper as well. \n\nThey all decided to meet up and talk about it and the girl who planned it made a big deal about how it\u2019s not fair that they would think she should work for free, and use her discounts that she pays for and not get reimbursed. She tried to make the case that the hotel would treat them better if she booked it because \u201cshe is in the industry\u201d and all. Essentially she was having them cover her portion, and make money. They all decided not to go, and my wife hasn\u2019t spoke to her since.",

Suddenly we are all back in high school, he is messaging the best man separately from the group and changing agreed plans. Iv no time for that sh1t so I leave them at it . He has the stag party of People agree to bigger costs for hotel and events, then a few weeks before the date moves us from city center 4 star to outside city where we have to pay taxis in and out every day, doing this ment a \u00a360 a head saving, times 20 ppl. Same with events, we were supposed to have a tour guide , paid for one. No your guide. It was the kind of city you need one. This caused no end of problems. We had airport lifts never arrive for us. Heard new guy talking to the best man half way through night two that they still had a few hundred in the kitty. Supposedly to pay for the stags drinks, in reality, they had a free weekend out of it.",

If you\u2019re the best man or a groomsman in a wedding you are traditionally expected to put in a fair bit of time and effort planning the bachelor party for the groom. The fact that one of the groomsman is already in this industry makes that job a lot easier for him\u2026 it doesn\u2019t give him a chance to make money for his own business and get a free ride. The bachelor party is all about supporting the groom, not about supporting some groomsman\u2019s business. \n\nYour photographer comparison is especially flawed. A friend working photography at your wedding wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy the event as a guest, so of course they should be compensated. This groomsman is completely enjoying the bachelor party, getting a free ride for himself and also making a profit off his so-called friends.",
