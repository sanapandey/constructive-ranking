    "selftext": "I am a 21y/o university student and got accepted to a fellowship abroad this summer. I didn't tell my mother till after I got accepted and she was really angry I didn't tell her before applying. \n\nI didn't want to tell her before because last summer I had an interview for a summer internship and she gave me a hard time. she stood at the door for the online interview and then afterwards proceeded to tell me everything I did wrong and how I wouldn't get accepted. When I got annoyed she said it was 'constructive criticism' but when asked what was constructed about it she said she didn't want to talk anymore. i am usually very receptive to feedback but this was just mean.\n\nAnyways this time around I did not want her to get in my head so I didn't tell her. When I finally did she told me she was not happy about me going as she said i need to come home and spend time with the family and take care of her. My grandma then got involved siding with her and they both were calling me selfish and ungrateful. I tried to argue back saying this was a good opportunity for me that won't come around again. i said i was proud of myself for this achievement even if they weren't and they called me rude. I said if i was selfish then why could i visit every weekend to see my family (2h travel time) and provide money to my mother when she needed it. i was really annoyed they kept calling me selfish so i calculated how much money i had given just over the last 2 years and a half which totaled to around 12,000. i send this number in a text and my mother was fuming. she said i was punishing her for her  saying i shouldn't do the fellowship and that i was holding it over her head because i gave her money. my grandmother said that it was nothing that i gave her money because my mother works hard and everyone gives money to help their parents because of all the money paid to raise them. I said its different because i am still a student and make minimum wage on the side.  side note- i never asked or was paid back any money i gave to my mother. After this i have not spoken to my mother nor has she spoken to me for almost a month now. I went home to which she blanked me when when I tried to greet her and ignored my attempts to talk to be mature and try and talk it out. i got another internship abroad this summer right before the initial one so ill be gone for 3-4 months (1st may-july, 2nd  august) doing them back to back. I don't plan to tell her, AITA?",

You didn\u2019t ask to be born, they chose to be parents and that means they chose everything that came out of it. Including taking care of your emotionally and financially. Go do your internship. Stop giving her money. Tell her if you\u2019re that bad of a daughter then maybe she\u2019s rather not see you. Sorry I\u2019m going a bit nuclear, but I hate when parents say you owe them because they\u2019ve raised you.",

You chose to have kids, and providing your kids with food, shelter, and minimum education is the consequence of choosing to have kids. Enjoy your studies, and hopefully you don't have to depend on these people for anything.",

I didn't tell my mother till after I got accepted and she was really angry I didn't tell her before applying. \n\nI didn't want to tell her before because last summer I had an interview for a summer internship and she gave me a hard time. she stood at the door for the online interview and then afterwards proceeded to tell me everything I did wrong and how I wouldn't get accepted. When I got annoyed she said it was 'constructive criticism' but when asked what was constructed about it she said she didn't want to talk anymore. i am usually very receptive to feedback but this was just mean.\n\nAnyways this time around I did not want her to get in my head so I didn't tell her. When I finally did she told me she was not happy about me going as she said i need to come home and spend time with the family and take care of her. My grandma then got involved siding with her and they both were calling me selfish and ungrateful. I tried to argue back saying this was a good opportunity for me that won't come around again. i said i was proud of myself for this achievement even if they weren't and they called me rude. I said if i was selfish then why could i visit every weekend to see my family (2h travel time) and provide money to my mother when she needed it. i was really annoyed they kept calling me selfish so i calculated how much money i had given just over the last 2 years and a half which totaled to around 12,000. i send this number in a text and my mother was fuming. she said i was punishing her for her  saying i shouldn't do the fellowship and that i was holding it over her head because i gave her money. my grandmother said that it was nothing that i gave her money because my mother works hard and everyone gives money to help their parents because of all the money paid to raise them. I said its different because i am still a student and make minimum wage on the side.  side note- i never asked or was paid back any money i gave to my mother. After this i have not spoken to my mother nor has she spoken to me for almost a month now. I went home to which she blanked me when when I tried to greet her and ignored my attempts to talk to be mature and try and talk it out. i got another internship abroad this summer right before the initial one so ill be gone for 3-4 months (1st may-july, 2nd  august) doing them back to back. I don't plan to tell her, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
