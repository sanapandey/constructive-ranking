    "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 calls me at least once sometimes twice during the workday. She works from home at a call center and will call me either during her break or after something like work drama happens. I enjoy talking with her and love it when she tells me about her day, but I'm at work and am in a small office with what is essentially my manager. Granted, where I work is a small non-profit and pretty laid back, but I feel weird being on the phone just shooting the breeze next to what is essentially my boss. \n\nShe just called me again to tell me about something funny that happened at work and she was laughing the entire time she was telling me the story. I figured I needed to put this to bed, so I told her that I love hearing about her day, but I am at work and I would rather hear it from her in person, at home, after work. I asked her if that makes sense and she said yeah, but you never ask me about my day anyway. I honestly didn't know what to say because she is right, I don't verbally ask her how her day is but I've said in the past that I love nothing more than to hear about her day even if it was shitty",

Everyone's work situation is different and she clearly has the time and space/privacy to call you but you don't really have that.\n\nSo...I feel like you've kind of got your answer here.  She seems to have reasonably understood what you were asking and has in turn verbalized what she's lacking from you.  Great on you for not getting defensive and actually listening to what she has expressed to you.\n\nDo you live together? Make an effort to talk about each other's day while making dinner/eating dinner or whatever, but yes, please make a point to ask about her day.  Some days there will be stories, some days not much, but that is such a HUGE HUGE thing about relationships. You need to show interest in what the other feels, experiences, etc.",

I\u2019ve been an asshole even though I wasn\u2019t intending to and I\u2019m going to do better for the girl I don\u2019t deserve\n\nEdit: Just an update to the whole thing. We talked after work and we both willingly admitted that there was fault on both sides. I wasn\u2019t making the effort after work to communicate and that resulted in her trying to reach out during work, but she understood why I said what I said about calling during work. We both agreed that we would drop everything when we both get out of work to communicate, not just about work but stuff in general to reinforce the bridge between us.\n\nBoth sides of the argument make great points, although the label \u201casshole\u201d might be a little intense, but I think it ultimately came down to poor communication which we are going to work on. Thank you all for your help, I might stick around the subreddit to help out or if I have any other issues",

This is calling your partner at work. It happens all the time. People often need to call their partner at work to coordinate things. My point was that people do call their partners at work sometimes. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure people can and do go 8 hours without talking to their partner. But people also do call their partners at work sometimes, even if it\u2019s just to check-in. This is not abnormal in any job I\u2019ve worked. I think it depends highly on the type of job you have. \n\nI am not suggesting that OP is wrong or his gf is right. I was just saying that plenty of people call their partners at work. When I was a student, I worked in the provost\u2019s office, and he had his wife on the \u201calways disturb\u201d list. She called once or twice a day. My colleagues often check in with their spouses in between classes. My husband calls me sometimes in between classes. It happens.",

That isn't deflecting blame, it's providing additional information that he didn't have before. We know he didn't have it because he's surprised by it.\n\nOn the other hand, he's known this was a problem the entire time, and rather than bring it up in the calm, relaxed environment of their home where he could gently break this news and provide emotional support, he interrupted her while she was telling a story that brought her joy to tell her that these conversations are an inconvenience to him. And he presumably did this within earshot of his boss and/or other coworkers, given his description of his work environment. What a slap in the face. Now she gets to finish her shift likely feeling alienated from her partner and embarrassed, all because he chose not to communicate his problem at a reasonable time and in a reasonable environment.

No one should be expected to read minds when there are channels of communication available.\n\nCaring for you partners emotions is not treating them like a child. Being empathetic and compassionate to the person you intend to spend your life with will build a stronger relationship than pretty much anything else. That doesn't mean coddling them, but it does mean bringing up problems at times where they're most likely to be resolved. Interrupting your happy partner to tell them they're doing something you'd rather they didn't will always create a bigger issue that takes longer to resolve than telling them you'd rather they didn't do that thing at an otherwise relaxed time.\n\nI'd be saying the same things if the roles were reversed, but you're entitled to your opinion.",

Why does she need you to ask about it? It isn't as if you would ignore her if she started telling you about her day.\n\n\nBut my perspective is also colored by having a toxic ex who also called me daily at work for instant gratification any time she wanted to share or needed to process an emotion, and even after I tried to set boundaries she would guilt me for not talking to her during my work day.\u00a0",

Ask her to understand that you don't work in private the way she does. You work around other people. You are expected to be working. And even if you have breaks, they don't naturally line up with her breaks.\n\nYou can also tell her that you are happy to ask her about her work day - once you both are home -and spend a little time just sharing your days with each other. You can tell her that you realize you are asking her to make a change to meet your workday needs, but you are also ready to make changes of your own to make clear that you want to hear about her day and you care about what happens in her life.\n\n(I didn't know for sure if you meant that you don't ask her about her day on these phone calls (understandable if you are trying not to prolong the call) or if you don't ask her about her day even at home.

She works from home at a call center and will call me either during her break or after something like work drama happens. I enjoy talking with her and love it when she tells me about her day, but I'm at work and am in a small office with what is essentially my manager. Granted, where I work is a small non-profit and pretty laid back, but I feel weird being on the phone just shooting the breeze next to what is essentially my boss. \n\nShe just called me again to tell me about something funny that happened at work and she was laughing the entire time she was telling me the story. I figured I needed to put this to bed, so I told her that I love hearing about her day, but I am at work and I would rather hear it from her in person, at home, after work. I asked her if that makes sense and she said yeah, but you never ask me about my day anyway. I honestly didn't know what to say because she is right, I don't verbally ask her how her day is but I've said in the past that I love nothing more than to hear about her day even if it was shitty\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Around the holidays we were both in separate towns and I wanted to call him to ask about his holidays and how it was going, we had a nice chat but before hanging up he said \u201cbtw this is a one time thing, don\u2019t expect for us to talk on the phone all the time it\u2019s super annoying\u201d I was taken aback. I brought it up later and he got really defensive saying he was just really honest and he doesn\u2019t want me to expect that type of thing because he\u2019s not going to change. The logic behind not liking phone calls is fine and he was being honest which I appreciate but I told him it made me feel weird and kind of sad that he didn\u2019t want to talk to the person he\u2019s dating. Work is definitely a boundary where you can\u2019t be distracted but honestly she\u2019s probably just excited or bored and wants to talk to her favorite person. Don\u2019t be mean but you also don\u2019t have to keep answering, just say you\u2019re busy and you\u2019d love to talk after work.",
