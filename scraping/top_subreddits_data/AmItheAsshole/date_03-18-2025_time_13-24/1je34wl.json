    "selftext": "We are getting married and I (33F) am paying for a good chunk of the wedding. \n\nI personally wanted to elope at this stage of life and take a long vacation in Europe. My fianc\u00e9 (37M) wants to have a blow out wedding. We decided to compromise and have a wedding in our home state and keep the guest list to 80 and under. Especially since I\u2019m paying for a majority of it out of pocket. \n\nHis mom started out this wedding planning process saying, \u201c You should do whatever you want. It\u2019s about YOU. Don\u2019t let anyone influence your decisions.\u201d Turns out she means that as long as SHE is the biggest influence on our wedding. Beyond insisting she wear a CREAM colored dress, sharing our wedding website with people without asking if that was ok, wanting her son\u2019s hair to be styled a certain way\u2026 she\u2019s been extremely difficult. \n\nHer latest endeavor has been inviting people to the wedding without our approval. She\u2019s invited 5 of her friends without asking and her excuse was that \u201cI just assumed that they were invited. They invited me to their children\u2019s weddings.\u201d \n\nThe newest problem is that her niece (40F) who lives across the country just broke up with her boyfriend in October of last year. I\u2019ve met the niece a handful of time and she\u2019s a great girl and we want her at the wedding. But her ex boyfriend was awful and I was happy that they broke up tbh. \n\nShe let us know that the niece is dating someone new and she should be given a plus one. I refused to give her one and told my fianc\u00e9: NO. He\u2019s been telling his mom no, and she\u2019s saying we\u2019re not being very nice and that the cousin will be alone. \nMy argument was that we\u2019ve never met this new person, they just started dating, and she will NOT be alone she will be around family. I guess her siblings are all married, so in that sense she will be alone. I also am trying to save us as much money as possible and never wanted to have a huge wedding anyways. So one less person is a win in my book. \nBut I still feel like my justifications are sound and I\u2019m right for not budging on this. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n",

Time for your fianc\u00e9 to have one final conversation with his mom letting her know that she doesn't get any input in the guest list or anything else, and if she oversteps she's going to lose her own invite.  She's already going to look pretty silly when all these randos she's invited don't end up getting invitations.  Because you're not sending them invitations, right?  RIGHT?",

And this isn't a problem that's suddenly gonna become magically better once you've tied the knot; a fianc\u00e9 who can't say no to his mother becomes a husband who can't say no to his mother. A ring and ceremony *will not* change who he is, what he is capable of, and what he is willing to do.\n\nSo, you need to keep in mind that you are *staring down your future* right now. It IS possible for people to change for the better-- but only if they actually *try* to change, and seek out effective methods of changing. Events like weddings and honeymoons, though, don't change people. So what you see IS what you get, and what you get is what you will have *forever,* unless he dedicates himself in good faith to changing that. \n\nImagine buying a house together. Imagine having children.  Imagine getting seriously ill or losing a close loved one or having any number of other terrible emergencies. And then imagine what all of those things could look like if your fianc\u00e9's mom wants to insert herself into the situation and he refuses to say no to her.\n\nIt might be wise to put a pause on wedding planning for a little bit while doing some premarital counseling (and probably individual counseling for him too), so you both can work on healthy techniques for establishing *and maintaining* boundaries in the face of your impending nuptials. You don't wanna marry a guy BEFORE he learns how to say \"no\" to Mom. \n\nDon't marry a tiger and then end up like \"I wish this tiger didn't have so many stripes though.\" See if the tiger can do something about the stripes *before* making a difficult-to-exit legal, social, and/or religious contract.",

This is not a gendered thing; Partner Who Wants Big Wedding is generally responsible for securing funding for it, and if they receive that funding from someone else, then Partner Who Wants Big Wedding should be grateful toward their patron-- even, or especially, when the patron is their future spouse. \n\nFMIL should *not be your problem to deal with.* Why the hell is this even being put on your plate?

If your FMIL can't respect your \"no,\" then she needs to go in communication time-out until she's ready to communicate like an adult talking to adults.

If FMIL doesn't want to pony up, then it needs to be made clear to her that her sole obligation is ensuring that the rehearsal dinner goes well, IF you deign to allow her to host it. Of course, you're well within your rights to not accept any money at all, if you don't wish to have any strings attached... but if you're gonna have strings anyway, then at least get paid for them!",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nWe are getting married and I (33F) am paying for a good chunk of the wedding. \n\nI personally wanted to elope at this stage of life and take a long vacation in Europe. My fianc\u00e9 (37M) wants to have a blow out wedding. We decided to compromise and have a wedding in our home state and keep the guest list to 80 and under. Especially since I\u2019m paying for a majority of it out of pocket. \n\nHis mom started out this wedding planning process saying, \u201c You should do whatever you want. It\u2019s about YOU. Don\u2019t let anyone influence your decisions.\u201d Turns out she means that as long as SHE is the biggest influence on our wedding. Beyond insisting she wear a CREAM colored dress, sharing our wedding website with people without asking if that was ok, wanting her son\u2019s hair to be styled a certain way\u2026 she\u2019s been extremely difficult. \n\nHer latest endeavor has been inviting people to the wedding without our approval. She\u2019s invited 5 of her friends without asking and her excuse was that \u201cI just assumed that they were invited. They invited me to their children\u2019s weddings.\u201d \n\nThe newest problem is that her niece (40F) who lives across the country just broke up with her boyfriend in October of last year. I\u2019ve met the niece a handful of time and she\u2019s a great girl and we want her at the wedding. But her ex boyfriend was awful and I was happy that they broke up tbh. \n\nShe let us know that the niece is dating someone new and she should be given a plus one. I refused to give her one and told my fianc\u00e9: NO. He\u2019s been telling his mom no, and she\u2019s saying we\u2019re not being very nice and that the cousin will be alone. \nMy argument was that we\u2019ve never met this new person, they just started dating, and she will NOT be alone she will be around family. I guess her siblings are all married, so in that sense she will be alone. I also am trying to save us as much money as possible and never wanted to have a huge wedding anyways. So one less person is a win in my book. \nBut I still feel like my justifications are sound and I\u2019m right for not budging on this. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My fianc\u00e9 is also 37m and if he tried this shit he\u2019d be out on his own within minutes). This will be an uphill battle at every single milestone and event you have in your life until she dies or you leave.
