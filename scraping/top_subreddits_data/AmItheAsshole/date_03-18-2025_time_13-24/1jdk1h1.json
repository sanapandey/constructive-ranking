    "selftext": "Last summer, a family vacation was planned for my family (M40, wife, and 2 kids) my brothers family (M33, wife, 1 kid), and our parents.\u00a0 The plan was to go to Maui in May 2025. Its\u00a0easily the most expensive trip any of us have been on.\u00a0 A fishing trip with dad was booked, a very expensive VRBO was booked and final payment occurred last month, and at that point could not be canceled. These shared costs were put on my credit card and I was fully reimbursed by all parties for their share.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLast week, my brothers Black Lab had a severe health issue.\u00a0 The\u00a0dog was 6 years old and unfortunately it passed.\u00a0 I got word of it and sent my\u00a0condolences.\u00a0 A few days later I got a phone call from my brother.\u00a0 Essentially he went all out trying to save the dog and has a significant vet bill coming his way.\u00a0 He informed me that him and his family are backing out of the trip. He asked for his money back that he paid me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNeedless to say a disagreement occurred between\u00a0us.\u00a0 He thinks because he canceled he should be reimbursed. My family and our parents will still be going. The trip can't be changed at this point.\u00a0 \u00a0But i'm not reimbursing him, i'm not about to pay another 7K out of my pocket.\u00a0\n\nI told him absolutely not.\u00a0 He's called me an asshole and threatened small claims court.\u00a0 Its been a pretty toxic last few days.\u00a0 He refuses to consider going citing finances, emotional distress from the dog, and he doesn't want to be around me.\u00a0 Am I the Asshole here?\u00a0\u00a0",

I can see the argument from both sides though... I really wish I could have looked at a full breakdown of cost versus what I paid.\n\nAlso I don't regret it. Banfield took great care of my guy and they loved him too. I probably saved money on dental cleanings and visits overall.",

When she was 12 her insurance was up to $130 per month but that wasnt nearly close to what we claimed for her heart each month.\n\nMy special, special, Lola Banana, she walked to a beat that only God and Lola could hear and thankfully she was not listening when they told her she would not live long.

Losing a pet is heartbreaking, losing one because you dont have enough money to save it is devastating. Premiums have risen, yes. I recently got another rescue, she is $60 per month.

But for the ones that do, it generally isn\u2019t \u201ctorture.\u201d\n\nFortunately, chemo doses in pets are less aggressive than in humans.  \nDoses of drugs and treatment schedules are designed to minimize discomfort to the pet.  Unlike people, where minimizing discomfort is important, but the importance of survival of the patient is rather a lot more emphasized for a human than a pet, so treatment is more aggressive.  \n\nAround 3/4 of the chemo patients my vet-boss worked with had no side effects from treatment.  The ones that did, they were far from \u201ctorturous.\u201d  Some nausea and diarrhea, some low white blood cell counts.  \n\nMy vet very rarely recommended and referred a patient for chemo, but when she did it was because she thought it has a reasonable chance of giving the pet a longer, happy life.  Mostly for low stage lymphomas in younger animals, since chemo had a decent shot of putting those into remission.\n\n\nSure, some kinds suck immensely, and the possible side effects versus likely outcome should be very carefully considered before opting for it, and so should the effects on family finances - but a lot of chemo is no more stressful than any other medical procedure.\n\nDo you thinks folks shouldn\u2019t get their pets broken legs set and casted, bite wounds flushed and cleaned, the rock they swallowed surgically removed from their intestine, or their rotten tooth pulled?  \n\nThose are also all Far from pleasant experiences for a pet.  One might say torturous.",

They didn't treat him to cure him like they do with humans, that is why chemo is so hard on humans. They treated him to reduce his symptoms and make him comfortable.

It was not something I was aware was a thing, as my family growing up did not ever book these type of trips. My husband's family did. Then we had kids, that had surgeries early in life, draining bank accounts and work PTO. I never thought to question getting the money back from a vacation we could not go on anymore. MIL or SIL always booked this, and they would tell us the cost. Others with less means at times have not been expected to pay their portion if they could not make this annual trip and the rest have split costs, my assumption was it would be the same for us. Didn't think they would be the people to deny trip insurance to make changes if needed, or that the expectation was they would keep our money if we backed out. Apparently prior to my existence in his life, this had been the case for my solo husband when he could not get time off work. \n\nThe knowledge ahead of time that this was the set up and agreement if anything happened, is the major NTA for me.

Its\u00a0easily the most expensive trip any of us have been on.\u00a0 A fishing trip with dad was booked, a very expensive VRBO was booked and final payment occurred last month, and at that point could not be canceled. These shared costs were put on my credit card and I was fully reimbursed by all parties for their share.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLast week, my brothers Black Lab had a severe health issue.\u00a0 The\u00a0dog was 6 years old and unfortunately it passed.\u00a0 I got word of it and sent my\u00a0condolences.\u00a0 A few days later I got a phone call from my brother.\u00a0 Essentially he went all out trying to save the dog and has a significant vet bill coming his way.\u00a0 He informed me that him and his family are backing out of the trip. He asked for his money back that he paid me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNeedless to say a disagreement occurred between\u00a0us.\u00a0 He thinks because he canceled he should be reimbursed. My family and our parents will still be going. The trip can't be changed at this point.\u00a0 \u00a0But i'm not reimbursing him, i'm not about to pay another 7K out of my pocket.\u00a0\n\nI told him absolutely not.\u00a0 He's called me an asshole and threatened small claims court.\u00a0 Its been a pretty toxic last few days.\u00a0 He refuses to consider going citing finances, emotional distress from the dog, and he doesn't want to be around me.\u00a0 Am I the Asshole here?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Prior to that point, there were no-A-holes-here, so long as you are being honest and upfront about the fact that nothing is cancellable and nothing can be refunded to you.\n\nYour brother is out of line expecting you to eat $7k in costs because it turns out they have some financial hardships coming down the pipes.

Also OP should have trip insurance regardless because no one knows wtf can happen that\u2019s why we have insurance. \n\nFor example I was suppose to go to North Carolina last month but 4 days prior to going I discovered that I had Covid and influenza a. \n\nSo naturally I can\u2019t go, I cancel the insured flight, and submitted a claim through insurance regarding my accommodations and even activities I had prepaid and all of it was refunded. I even got an additional $200 for canceling due to having Covid. \n\nSo regardless of asking the brother or not, not having insurance does show negligence and it does put OP on the hook to refund because his brother can\u2019t go through the insurance company to file the proper claims because OP didn\u2019t insure the trip period. \n\nOr perhaps he did insure the trip and simply doesn\u2019t want to cancel so that the proper claims can be filed because it would make his costs go up since brother is no longer able to go. And if that\u2019s the case that makes OP a real asshole and a thief. So I stand by the ESH/ TA verdict.",
