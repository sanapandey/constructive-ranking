    "selftext": "I (19F) am in my first year of college and live in a small dorm room on campus. My sister (26F) had a baby a few months ago, and she\u2019s been struggling financially. She and the baby\u2019s father broke up, and she had to move back in with our parents.\n\nThe problem is, she hates living there because our parents are \u201ctoo controlling\u201d and \u201cjudgmental\u201d about her being a single mom. She asked if I could request permission for her to stay in my dorm with her baby for a while because it would be \u201cquieter\u201d and give her \u201cspace to figure things out.\u201d\n\nI told her no. My dorm is tiny, barely big enough for me, and I have a roommate. Plus, a baby crying all night in a shared dorm? That\u2019s not fair to my roommate or me. She got upset and said I was being selfish, that family should help each other, and that she\u2019d do it for me if roles were reversed.\n\nNow my parents are also pressuring me to \"just let her stay for a little while\" because she\u2019s struggling. My roommate thinks the whole situation is crazy and that I shouldn\u2019t feel bad, but I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m being a bad sister.\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I spoke to the dorm incharge and was told it wouldn't be allowed at all. I informed my parents and sister about it but my sister is still upset and says i should have been more \"open to the idea\" and that I shouldn't have denied her for \"my selfish reasons\" before asking for permission.",

I refused to share my college dorm room with my sister who has a child due to my dorm room being too small and me having a roommate. \n2. It might make me the asshole becsue it makes me look selfish.

            "body": "NTA.\n\nAs you stated - a crying baby is not fair or quiet for anyone. How loud can your parents' house be that she needs to get away? It's not about volume, it's that she doesn't want to listen to mom and dad tell her they are disappointed in her choices.\n\nMy guess is your campus will have a firm \"No\" as an answer to this. So, I actually do encourage you to reach out to them to ask what the policy is on non-students living on campus/in a dorm room that is already at capacity. If, as I suspect, it's a clear \"Not allowed\" - print that out and hand it to both her and your parents.\n\nEditing to add: Your sister would 100% use this as an excuse to use you as free labor to take care of her child. This is a time when you should be focusing on schoolwork and living the college life, not taking care of someone else's baby.",

The agreement addresses guest policies, including overnight guests and the fact that unauthorized residents are strictly prohibited from becoming occupants of the dorm room and resident hall.\n\nViolation of the housing agreement can lead to: loss of your housing privileges, steep fines, and possibly expulsion from the university. \n\nHow exactly can that lead to the family using it to get OP expelled?

Crying babies can be heard from neighbors in apartments, even with rooms in between them and the baby. Plus, the only place for the baby to play is going to be in the common rooms where people watch tv. Students aren't going tyo be thrilled with being asked to not have the tv loud and playing things a baby shouldn't be exposed to, whether it's shows or video games. There's going to be a lot of noise disturbance for the baby as dorms have a lot of slamming doors and loud music, even parties. There's no way they can hide the baby from people, or the sister for that matter.",

No. That's not just an unreasonable request, it's an *unfeasible* request.\n\nEdit: if it'll ease your mind you could always ask your school if there's a way you can do that.

My sister (26F) had a baby a few months ago, and she\u2019s been struggling financially. She and the baby\u2019s father broke up, and she had to move back in with our parents.\n\nThe problem is, she hates living there because our parents are \u201ctoo controlling\u201d and \u201cjudgmental\u201d about her being a single mom. She asked if I could request permission for her to stay in my dorm with her baby for a while because it would be \u201cquieter\u201d and give her \u201cspace to figure things out.\u201d\n\nI told her no. My dorm is tiny, barely big enough for me, and I have a roommate. Plus, a baby crying all night in a shared dorm? That\u2019s not fair to my roommate or me. She got upset and said I was being selfish, that family should help each other, and that she\u2019d do it for me if roles were reversed.\n\nNow my parents are also pressuring me to \"just let her stay for a little while\" because she\u2019s struggling. My roommate thinks the whole situation is crazy and that I shouldn\u2019t feel bad, but I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m being a bad sister.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And if your family have a problem with you telling the school, you can tell them that the rumour mill made its way to them and they\u2019re just clarifying the rules.

Add in a breakup and parents who sound less than completely supportive and I have no doubt that your sister is struggling.  However, it's not your job or your responsibility to fix her.

You can usually find social workers through your local hospital or community health clinic or by Google. Send your sister looking in that direction. \n\nDon't you get distracted! I'm sure you've got papers due and exams to study for coming up faster than you realize!
