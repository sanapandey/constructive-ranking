            "body": "NTA. Traveled down this road with my eldest brother, have another brother doing the same stupid thing - even though we both watched lives and families destroyed by this addiction. You're not giving up on the person, as much as you are realizing your efforts are a crutch to a problem only they alone must make the effort to solve/manage. Some people cannot stop using their addiction as their excuse for inaction. Some people cannot stop using their depression as a justification for continuing the addiction. These two default coping mechanisms become so deeply ingrained, all other healthy behaviors fail to take root. \n\nWhen you have a hammer(alcoholism) every problem looks like a nail(reason to drink).\n\nYour friend needs professional help. At the most, you could offer to sit through sessions with them if they thought it would start a healthy trend. But it's not your responsibility to do so. You've extended yourself well beyond what's required. It's perfectly fine to step away from this, knowing their wellness isn't based on your efforts or desires but their own.\n\nIt's not a bad idea to find a little bit of therapy for your own wellbeing. Surviving as a witness to addiction can be just as traumatic as supporting a terminally ill patient. There is guilt, frustration and grief as you watch them struggle. If an unfortunate end to their story comes, it's helpful to have processed and prepared a portion of the tidal waves of emotion that come with.\n\nGood luck to you. This is one of those life decisions that is always easier said than done. I hope you are kind to yourself as you find your way.",

Sounds like he's an addict and (as is the case with many addicts) also has mental health problems that he's either treating with alcohol, or are caused by alcohol, or both.\n\nEventually, you need to realize, having tried everything, that this is something you can't fix. Go to Alanon, or some similar resource for people who are friends or relatives of alcoholics, for information on dealing with alcoholics when you aren't one yourself. \n\nMaybe, when he's ready, he will take advantage of some form of treatment - support groups, rehabs - and, probably after numerous relapses, recover. Maybe he won't. Many addicts die before they recover, or admit that they need to recover. But that's not your fault - you've done what you could, it hasn't worked, and that's not your fault. You are not all-powerful, and addiction, with its tendency to involve relapses, is an incredibly difficult thing to deal with. People who've never been that bad, who've merely used more or less socially and then stopped, think all drinkers (or drug users) can do the same and just stop. But people who are seriously deep in addiction can't, and you can't make them stop or help them change.",
