No links to reddit content in the Open Forum.\n\nMuch like your mom said to your dad many years ago, \"oh shit, I'm 5 days late.\"\n\nNo real topic this month. \n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\n**We\u2019re always looking for mods with Typescript experience when the apps are open.**\n\nAnd we always need US overnight time mods. Currently, we could also benefit from mods who can be active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mod tools are improving and trickling in, but are not quite there yet.\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.",

                    "body": "First off, you're just plain wrong about what Rule 12 is. We don't view trans people as a debate topic. We view questions that center around identity and societal norms regarding the same as debate topics, because without fail they cause debates about societal norms. That means questions about racism, sexism, colorism, homophobia, or transphobia are all not allowed. We're not here for people to decide where the line is; there's debate subs for that.\n\nSecond, do you want to be told that you need to stay in the closet or else you're the asshole? That you're the asshole because your gender makes your existence is a net negative to others? Every piece of transphobic drivel you have ever heard, do you want so subject your trans siblings to that? Folks who come here to ask if they're the asshole because they asked to be treated like a human being? Do you have *any* idea how many people I have very happily banned for using transphobic slurs, for trying to deny the existence of trans people, for claiming it's a mental illness, for misgendering? It happens on posts where a trans person is just part of the story; on posts where they're asking about something integral to their identity (pronouns, name, dress, etc) it happens A LOT. In addition to not being a debate sub in general, we also really prefer not to give bigots the opportunity to spew their hate and claim they're participating under guidelines.\n\nAnd, finally, issues of identity are not moral issues. There is nothing morally wrong in being trans, in dressing the way you want, in using the name and pronouns you want. If a post boils down to \"Am I the asshole for [not confirming to gender expectations]\" there is no way for there to be a debate. It's like consent; it isn't a moral issue to be debated. It's a fundamental right all people should have. The only way to argue against it it to be a bigot, and as I said before, we will not allow that.\n\nBut hey, thank you ever so much for saying that I'm enabling my own extermination just because you don't understand jack. Feel free to find a different AITA-style subreddit if you want; as I understand the rest all have much looser rules. I'm sure one that's less heavily moderated and therefore allows more bigotry through will be more to your liking.",

However, if you post here for judgment on an interpersonal conflict because you are wondering if you are an asshole, then you are seeking validation for your thoughts and emotions on the topic, which is a legitimate conflict. \n\nIf your conflict is **only** about internal (or intrapersonal) feelings, then that is not allowed and violates rule 7. Still not rule 8 though. \n\nHope that helps!",
