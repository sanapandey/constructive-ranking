Recording or live streaming images from inside the car. There is also probably a camera that could face the talent.  The black thing on the roof is a satellite used to transmit video. \n\nThe company makes these vehicles in many different sizes and formats.

Thermal imaging cameras sense emissions in the _far-infrared_ portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is not to be confused with _near-infrared_ cameras, commonly used for night vision in inexpensive home security cameras. Thermal imaging cameras are particularly fun to play with.",

I worked in the civilian side of the business and found that business unit was hugely dysfunctional, rife with questionable ethics, and lacked discipline to get things done.
