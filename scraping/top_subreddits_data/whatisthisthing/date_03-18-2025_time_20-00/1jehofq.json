Sprinkled on the ground underneath the fence. \n\nMy dog got REALLY really sick, went blind and almost died.  the vet suspects poison, but we don\u2019t use anything like that in/around the house for obvious reasons. Is that what this is or is it just some odd fertilizer? I wasn\u2019t able to find anything like it on google. ",

While it is certainly possible that a pre/post emergent/ certain fertilizer can do that, but more likely it is insecticides. Ask your neighbor what exactly they put down. None of these look like insecticides, but all my knowledge is for southern states in east coast US, and if you are aren\u2019t even in the US then the chemicals used may be very different",
