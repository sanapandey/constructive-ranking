    "selftext": "Hello White People Twitter, we are back! As you know, this community has always been a home for sharp, funny, and insightful social commentary. Like any great space, we've had our share of bumps\u2014some from within, some from outside. The good news? We believe Reddit has our back on the external stuff, so we need YOU to help us keep things smooth inside. By following the rules and reporting violations, we can keep this place thriving. Let\u2019s let the good times roll while staying inside the lines!\n\n# The Rules\n\nReddit has sitewide rules ([reddit.com/site-rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules)) that apply to every subreddit, including ours. Here\u2019s the gist:\n\n* **No harassment or bullying.**\u00a0Public figures? Fair game. Regular people? Off-limits. No doxxing whatsoever.\u00a0\n* **No violence, even as a joke.**\u00a0That means no \u2018hypotheticals\u2019 about Luigi (and no calling for Mario either\u2014sorry).\u00a0[More on Reddit\u2019s violent content policy here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151-Do-not-post-violent-content).\n* **Avoid broad generalizations.**\u00a0Discuss actions and policies, not entire groups.\n* **Stay on topic.**\u00a0Keep posts and comments relevant.\n\n# How to Stay in the Game\n\n* **Attack ideas, not people.**\u00a0Disagree all you want, but don\u2019t get personal.\u00a0\n* **Humor is welcome\u2014hate isn\u2019t.**\u00a0Keep humor sharp, not hateful\u2014no hate speech, no calls for violence.\n* **Not sure? Rephrase.**\u00a0Better safe than banned.\u00a0\n* **Report, don\u2019t engage.**\u00a0The mod team has your back. Trolls feed on attention\u2014let them starve by hitting the report button and moving on.\n\n# Why It Matters\n\nWe love this space, and we know you do too. Staying within the lines helps us keep WPT strong, and we believe Reddit wants that too. Following the rules keeps our space thriving and makes it easier for them to support us.\n\n[We have the best subreddit. Because of you!](https://imgur.com/a/rSOWw7v)",
