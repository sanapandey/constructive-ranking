That\u2019s why I just said that, it wasn\u2019t really a fear\u2026 it\u2019s already happened.

The talking heads who are actively anti-Semitic are right wing adjacent morons that will go on a tirade, just like the person above who commented anti-Semitic shit. Zionism doesn't just mean Israel has a right to exist, it's an entire ideology that literally mirrors Nazism. Please name me one Progressive and point me in the right direction and please read up on the first Nakba and Palestinian history.",

What you've seen for yourself is not enough or misconstrued to a point that you don't understand critical history in this topic. It is a black and white issue. Israel is an apartheid state with Zionist ideology. Real Jews are not pro-genocide and are backing Pro-Palestinian groups, who happen to be progressive or socialist in nature. Right wing groups are using this conflict to conduct anti-Semitic propaganda. Seriously read a book.",
