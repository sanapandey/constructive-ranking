It's clearly obvious that Kanye has mental issues and has since his mom died. The death HE thinks he caused. Normal people in this thread are feeling for that.

In his mind hes either this awesome incredible artist with infinite creativity to pull from or a boring zombie. Its exactly why hes always needed someone to keep him in check and medicated. I think after donda died he lost the one person that could do that and thats where we're at now. Yeezus was already clearly an album made by someone with bdp and its just spiraled more and more since then. The stuff kanyes doing is terrible, but ppl like ty and Justin Laboy that are using the mentally destroyed shell that he is are pure scum of the earth.",
