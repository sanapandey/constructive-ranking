This like when Kanye said \u201cmy favorite instrument is the human voice\u201d. Carti isn\u2019t even a singer he\u2019s just like uses his falsetto voice as an instrument and makes noise and repeats little phrases on shit other people made for him. Experimental? Sure.

It was so bad I don't even wanna check out his new album, even though my favorite artist is featured on a few songs\n\nBut there is a reason he got famous. His music was never that complex, but he made it sound good. FETTI by him and Maxo Kream is one of the best examples I have of that.\n\nBut I can't help but agree with you to a large extent. WLR was terrible and I can't mark it up to not having a taste for it. I would rather listen to cliche artists over people that genuinely have a bad sound",
