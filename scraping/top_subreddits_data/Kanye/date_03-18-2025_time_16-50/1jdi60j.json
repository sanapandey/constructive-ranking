In one of the hardest states in the US. \n\nLaw is a technically challenging and unforgiving subject. \n\nSo she is well capable of applying herself to an problem and solving it. It took her a few goes but she passed it fair and square as any other.",

What upsets me is that Kim is abusing a non-traditional method of obtaining a law license that was meant for low income individuals who could not afford law school. Law school itself is difficult, facing professors who grill you during class and the exams each year. She is basically hiring tutors and not going through the law school experience. Also, a majority of first years would have no issue passing the baby bar. If she is struggling to pass this, she will struggle mightily with the actual bar exam, which is hard. Nonetheless, I do admire that she is pursuing law for criminal justice reform. Tiffany Trump graduated from Georgetown; Kim should attend law school.",
