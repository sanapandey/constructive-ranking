    "selftext": "So, this question has bothered me for the better part of a decade. Why is it that gravity, being a weaker force than EM, dictate the orbit earth? I have been told because the earth and our star are electrically neutral in a microscopic scale, but this doesn't make any sense to me. If you look at an illustration of the EM produced by our planet you can see the poles, in my mind this has always represented the positive and the negative. Is that incorrect? \n\nOur magnetic north pole has moved more in recent years than in recorded history, it now floats around Siberia, our climate is changing and has been changing even more rapidly since 2017 when the pole shifted over 300 miles. If you pay attention to the jet streams in our atmosphere and the \"unusual\" storms that are occurring across the globe, they actually line up with where they would be if we were orbiting via EM. \n\nSomeone please prove me wrong cause I'm tired of thinking about this every day and every resource and every person telling me I'm crazy for thinking this.",

            "body": "So, the Earth and Sun are both electrically neutral, so there is no electrostatic attraction (or repulsion) between them. So, that leaves magnetism. And it is true, both the Sun and Earth have a magnetic field, so their magnetic fields should interact. However, the magnetic field from a dipole falls off at 1/r^(3), so at far distances ( and the Sun is ~150M km or ~90M miles away, which is really far), the force is very small. That is why gravity dominates, because even though gravity is the \"weakest\" force, gravitational attraction falls off at 1/r^(2) so at far distances, it can \"beat out\" magnetism.",

And the gradient of the potential field is the electric (or gravitational) field (which is what turns that 1/r into a 1/r^(2). \n\nAlso, the electric field from an infinite line of charges will fall off at 1/r. Of course, you can never have an infinite line of charges. But, if you have a \"long\" line of charges, such that your distance away from the charge is small compared to the length of the line of charges, then a 1/r fall off will approximate the actual measured falloff.",

To me, that begs the question of what falls off at r^-1 and r^-4 . I can understand if the nature of expressing geometric spacetime physics as math equations preclude a field falling off at r^-4, making it absurd to ask such a question.",

It can definitely go beyond 1/r3: for instance, you get 1/r6 and 1/r7 factors in Van der Waals forces, and from what I recall the highest factor to ever appear in a physical formula is something like r^15",

As was mentioned earlier, if you could have a truly infinite line of electric charges, then the electric field from it would fall off as 1/r, rather than 1/r\u00b2, because the little tiny contributions from all the infinitely many points of electric charge slow down the rate of fall-off.\n\nOther arrangements can make the falloff happen faster or slower. As an example, you can have an electric dipole, where you have a positive electric charge and a negative electric charge right next to each other. The electric field produced by this dipole will fall off *faster* than either charge alone, because they are partially cancelling out one another. You can think of it as the *positive* field falls off as 1/r\u00b2, and the *negative* field also falls off as 1/r\u00b2, but the two stacked on top of each other result in less excitation, exactly the same as if it were one single electric field falling off at 1/r\u00b3, at least when you're sufficiently far away. If you're very close, meaning the distance away from the dipole is of similar size to the distance between the two charges, the field is much more complicated.\n\nThe thing is, as far as we know, you can't have a \"magnetic charge\". *All* magnetism, as far as we know, always has both a positive pole and a negative pole. Hence, you can't have things like the infinite line of charges. You're stuck *always* having the magnetic dipole geometry, which causes the magnetic field to fall off as 1/r\u00b3 because the \"north charge\" (if such a thing existed) is partially cancelling out the \"south charge\", just like the electric dipole above.\n\nGravity cannot have such cancellations, however, because it doesn't *have* two types of charge. It only has one: mass. As far as we know, no forms of matter exist that have negative mass. As a result, you can't set up any form of cancellation, and thus gravity never has anything like a dipole that can reduce its measured strength.",

Its electric field falls off like r^-2\n\n* If you have a positive and a negative electric charge next to each other, we call it a dipole. Its electric field falls off like r^-3\n\n* If you make a square of alternating positive and negative charges, we call it a quadrupole. Its electric field falls off like r^-4\n\n* If you make a cube of alternating positive and negative charges (not unrealistic, this is basically what a salt crystal is, alternating Na^+ and Cl^- ), we call it an octopole. Its electric field falls off like r^-5\n\nAll of this applies to magnetic fields too, except that we have never found an isolated magnetic charge. There's never a north pole without a south pole - they always come paired. This means there is no magnetic monopole field, but there are still magnetic dipole, quadrupole, and octopoles. \n\nThese are all described as \"moments\" of a charge distribution. You can learn more about them in many standard electrodynamics text, though the math is a little heavy. Griffiths *Introduction to Electrodynamics* is the standard choice for undergrads.

(the \"butter gun\" is a common example)\n\nMagnetic fields are a bit weird though since they're self-cancelling.  A magnetic monopole (e.g. a \"north pole\" with no \"south pole\" attached) would have mangetic field lines that extend to infinity, just like gravitational or isolated electrostatic field lines do, and would fall off with the same 1/r\u00b2 as everything else.\n\nBut since they don't exist, and real-world dipole magnetic fields loop back on themselves, the further you get from the magnet the more magnetic field lines have a chance to loop back on themselves and cancel out, so there's fewer and fewer total magnetic field lines the further you get.  The total falls off as 1/r, and since the total is falling with distance, when combined with the same 1/r\u00b2 for how much total surface area it has to be spread across, you get the \"weird\" 1/r\u00b3 result.\n\n(I should qualify this with the fact that the subatomic nuclear forces have their own REALLY weird things going on, and behave nothing at all like the macroscopic forces... but that's a conversation for another day, and is not really relevant to anything larger than a atomic nucleus anyway.)",

But let's check what happens when we divide by bigger and bigger numbers.\n\n1 foot away: no change, because 1\u00b2=1\u00b3=1.   \n2 feet away: 100/2\u00b2 = 100/4 = 25; 1,000,000/2\u00b3 = 1,000,000/8 = 125,000    \n5 feet away: 100/5\u00b2 = 100/25 = 4; 1,000,000/5\u00b3 = 1,000,000/125 = 5000   \n10 feet away: 100/10\u00b2 = 1, 1,000,000/10\u00b3 = 1,000\n\nAs you can see, even having moved only 10 feet away, the huge force has already dropped enormously faster than the small force. At the start, the bigger force was ten thousand times bigger. At ten feet away, it's only a thousand times bigger. If we go out to ten thousand feet...the two become *equal.* And beyond that point? The force that falls off as 1/r\u00b2 will *always* be stronger.\n\nAs a result, gravity is the force that dominates over long distances. It is too difficult to get electrostatic attraction at large scale because matter is made of a mix of positive and negative charges. It's impossible to get strong enough magnetic attraction at large distances because magnets always come in paired north-and-south dipoles, which weaken the magnetic attraction at large distances like outer space.\n\nOnly gravity, which only has one \"charge\" (positive mass), can exert the necessary force at cosmic distances. It's the weakest of the fundamental forces, but all of the others cancel out or fall off too fast. Only slow-and-steady gravity holds things together consistently enough to allow stable structures like solar systems and galaxies.\n\nAnd, just in case you think this must mean gravity is truly strong, remember that a little tiny refrigerator magnet is strong enough to resist the gravitational pull of *the whole Earth*...over very short distances. But unlike the Earth, which has a gravitational pull that we have to go a huge distance to escape, even our most powerful magnets are totally imperceptible at a distance of a few km/miles.\n\nIt takes an Earth-sized object to do gravity at this scale, but that Earth-sized object has a reach that no other fundamental forces can match. A weak force, but one that eventually dominates at large distances.",

The poles (depending on exactly which ones you are talking about) represent the axis for Earth's rotation, or for the North and South poles of Earth's magnetic field.

The average electric charge at each of the poles is zero, just as it is across the entire surface of the Earth.\n\n>If you pay attention to the jet streams in our atmosphere and the \"unusual\" storms that are occurring across the globe, they actually line up with where they would be if we were orbiting via EM. \n\nNo, they don't ... that's just a silly claim to make.  If we were orbiting due to electromagnetic forces, then we would expect to have spiralled into the Sun already by now, as well as for both the Earth and the Sun to have opposite, net electric charge (which they measurably do not).\n\nYou seem to be trending in the direction of a long-debunked, crackpot pseudoscientific idea known as \"[plasma cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cosmology).\"  The problems with plasma cosmology in explaining observations are serious, and exhaustingly large in number.  It is not taken seriously by any respectable cosmologists because it is simply wrong at face value and not even remotely compatible with observations.  Proponents of this pseudoscientific idea typically ignore most of the scientific evidence against it, focusing only on the few things which could potentially be explainable with it.  However, you cannot just ignore most of the cosmos when you are attempting to make a working model of the cosmos ...",

Most matter that is not electrically neutral will be attracted towards matter with the opposite charge and undergo a chemical reaction with it that leaves both pieces of matter in a closer to neutral state. This obviously isn't 100% true. Electrically charged matter does exist, but it's a deviation from the steady state, rather than the steady state itself. \n\nNegative matter/energy (while hypothesized to exist in certain exotic circumstances) for all practical purposes does not exist. So the same dynamic does not take place for gravity. This means gravity rather than electromagnetism is the dominant force on macroscopic distances.",

In near enough proximity the poles of each celestial body could interact, but not without interacting simultaneously with the opposite pole as well. As the distance between the bodies becomes sufficiently large (like some multiple of the smaller's diameter) the overall charge would act like a point charge with the total charge of the planet, which again is zero for dipoles.",
