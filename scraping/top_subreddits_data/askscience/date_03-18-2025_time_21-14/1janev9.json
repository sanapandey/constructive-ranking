The biggest of which is taking a bath or shower.  \nBut the yeast and bacteria also live in our pores and other cracks and crevices of our skin that these activities can\u2019t get to, so the microbiome does recolonize.  \nI listened to an interesting RadioLab episode about this where Robert talked about shaking JFKs hand when he was young and not wanting to wash it.  Then they did a science experiment where he shook DeGrass Tyson\u2019s hand, and they did a swab of each to see what microbes moved from one person to the other. It was a pretty interesting episode.",

Actually soap largely functions by washing away the microbes through encapsulating them in micelles, which causes them to wash away with water. Scrubbing on the other hand will help to remove dead skin cells, which microbes can be attached to. \n\nThe timescale for repopulation is generally hours. For example, when we perform skin microbiome studies, we ask participants to refrain from showering for ~12 hours so that there is sufficient microbial material to sample. But this is dependent upon skin site - regions like the armpit, groin, belly button are considered moist and occluded, which is optimal for bacterial growth. So these sites may repopulate much faster than say your forearm, which is comparatively drier.",

Bacteria grow logistically meaning their population doubles after a certain amount of time. It\u2019s hard to calculate exactly since each person\u2019s flora varies. \n\nWaxing leaves your hair follicles open and vulnerable to infection. You\u2019re advised to keep that area clean for the first 24-48 hours so the wounds close up. You also have bacteria normally living in your follicles, it\u2019s only when harmful bacteria gain access to that area you may develop an infection (look up hot tub folliculitis).",

A good number of the species living in or on you may indeed be wiped out, but will frequently return, or regrow to their previous numbers.\n\n\nI would be interested to hear about how our hygiene routines have affected the evolution of our various biomes.\u00a0",
