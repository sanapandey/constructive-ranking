            "body": "An Eastern Subterranean termite colony will contain 3 to 5 hundred thousand termites at maturity.  A Formosan Termite colony will have 3 to 5 Million termites.  The natural state of a termite is in mid molt. Exoskeleton has not hardened.  The Queen secretes a hormone call juvenile hormone to keep her subjects from fully developing their reproductive organs and wings, it also stops their exoskeleton from hardening.  Thus causing them to lose moisture like crazy.    \n\nThey are more susceptible to damage and death than ants.",
