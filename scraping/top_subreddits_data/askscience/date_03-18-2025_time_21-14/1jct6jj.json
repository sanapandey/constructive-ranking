Is it the nerves? The tissue difference?? Thank you in advance, tried to google but couldn\u2019t find any straightforward answers \n\nEDIT: Wow. Thank you all so much for your answers, I\u2019ve gone 23 years not knowing a whole lot about HSV-1 and your responses have truly been enlightening! Appreciate you all :) ",

            "body": "I got my Ph.D. in HSV-1 biology, this is a really interesting question!  There have been some really good answers, too, so I won't re-hash what's been said about latent, long term infection and recurrence being a result of sensory neurons.\n\n  It can infect skin cells, but doesn't typically infect non-mucosal skin because that skin is protected by a layer of keratin to which the virus cannot bind nor can it infect.  This ability to infect skin cells has actually led to the development and approval of an FDA approved treatment for skin cancer using genetically engineered HSV-1!  \n\n  \n  Typically, the most common secondary location for HSV-1 infection is the eye (which also happens to be enervated by the same ganglia as the lips and mouth).  In the United States, for example, HSV-1 is the leading cause of blindness due to an infectious agent.\n\n  \nIf you have other questions about HSV-1 I would be happy to answer!",

So it's not exposed to the immune system very much, and has a number of ways to bind and get into cells.",

All of the normal tissue immune cells would eventually be there, but the speed of viral replication, amount of virus produced, and how infectious it is means that it spreads faster through the tissue than those immune mechanisms can control before spread.  The very, very ends of the nerve cells are also nuzzled right up next to the epithelial cells, especially in highly densely enervated tissue like the lips, so they often can spread from skin cell to skin cell to skin cell to nerve with minimal time outside a cell.",

They are very very similar in terms of symptoms, but type 1 is more common in oral infections and type 2 is more common in genital. Both viruses tend to have more symptoms if you get them \u00a0at their \u201cpreferred\u201d site. So for instance, you can get HSV-1 genitally, but your symptoms will usually be very mild. Many people will never experience an recurring\u00a0outbreak after the initial infection.\n\nBoth are extremely common, but HSV-1 is even more so. I\u2019m seeing around 67% of the population as\u00a0a\u00a0recent\u00a0estimate. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s \u201cmost of the population\u201d. But 2/3 is not \u00a0absolutely everyone.\n\nWhen people quote this statistic, I think they are sometimes including other viruses in the herpesvirus family that go by other colloquial names and have very different symptoms than HSV-1 and 2. For instance, chickenpox/shingles is caused by a herpesvirus and was extremely common until the rollout of the vaccine in the mid-90s. So just be aware that people don\u2019t *always* just mean HSV-1 and 2 when they talk about herpesviruses. It\u2019s also important to note that these viruses don\u2019t have cross-immunity, so having one doesn\u2019t make you less susceptible to another.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of what is \u201cbenign\u201d. It\u2019s true that many people who have HSV-1 or 2 never experience any symptoms and likely don\u2019t even know they have the virus(es). And the symptoms themselves are, except in very rare circumstances, extremely inconsequential. It\u2019s a painful, itchy rash that clears up within a few days with some cheap medication. There are studies ongoing into possible connections to other diseases and conditions, but nothing definitive has been proven to suggest that the average non-immunocompromised person is at risk of more severe health outcomes as a result of infection. (This is all regarding HSV-1 and 2; symptoms of other herpesviruses like shingles can be much more severe.)",

I used to work in medical research fundraising, which meant that I read and learned a ton about Alzheimer\u2019s disease despite not being a scientist. At the time, one of our funded labs was looking at possible connections between HSV-1 and AD. But at least from my layperson\u2019s understanding at the time, it wasn\u2019t so much that the virus had a special relationship to AD. It was more that it\u2019s an incredibly common infection, and as you age, your brain becomes less effective at protecting itself from pathogens. So while the lab was finding HSV-1 particles in a lot of brains of AD patients, they suspected this was probably just due to its high prevalence.\u00a0\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve seen some more news about this HSV-1/AD connection but I don\u2019t often see the explanation that our researchers gave (i.e. it\u2019s not that HSV specifically causes AD, it\u2019s that AD might be partially caused by low-level infections in the brain more generally, and HSV is just a common culprit because it\u2019s such a common virus). But I know the press often misses this kind of nuance when trying to translate science for a lay audience. And unfortunately I can\u2019t go back to the researcher we were funding and ask him, because he\u2019s passed away.\u00a0\n\nThat was long-winded, sorry! Just wondering if you know anything about this? Does recent research suggest some more direct link between HSV and AD?",

If at some future point you started having coldsores at your genitals the overwhelmingly most likely reason is that you have also picked up an HSV-2 infection.\n\n> Severity of outbreaks typically goes down over time, what makes the virus innervate a whole new area? \n\nNothing to my knowledge. You need a new HSV infection from the other type of HSV for a new area to become affected.\n\nTo my understanding the order of events is. If you are uninfected with either HSV strain (1 or 2)then it is possible but rare on first infection (before you have any HSV anitbodies) to pick up a multi-site infection but you'd have coldsores at all sites from day one. The most common infection pattern is to get an HSV infection at only one muscous membrane site. If you are healthy then the infection will be constrained only to the one site and you can not be re-infected elsewhere with the strain of HSV (1 or 2) that you already have. You can however pick up a second HSV infection elsewhere by being infect with the strain of HSV you do not have.\n\nBoth HSV-1 and HSV-2 can infect any mucous membrane but HSV-2 seems to have a strong preference for the genital mucosa. As I understand it there seems to be some inconclusive evidence that having one HSV strain infection gives you a mild but unreliable protection against the other strain.  I also understand that the the longer you go without outbreaks it seems people become less infectious but again the evidence here is poor and not well understood. It is certainly the case that you can pass on HSV1 or 2 without having a coldsore outbreak",

Naturally, I think there\u2019s a concentrated infection site when a flare up occurs. Does blindness happen quietly?",

            "body": "Short answer: you develop immunity that is sufficient to stop infection at a new location (although it won't evict the original infection).  \n\nEdit: I now realize I didn't answer OP's specific question, which is more about which parts of the body are susceptible under *any* circumstances. Other replies covered that nicely. I hope my reply helps OP (and others) feel less anxious about self-transmission, though!  \n\nLonger answer: the process you're talking about is called autoinoculation, and there's a frustrating dearth of information about it (for HSV). [This article](https://www.stdcheck.com/blog/can-you-give-yourself-genital-herpes/) is dedicated to the topic, and it still fails to mention that it's very rare for someone to \"give themself\" HSV at a second site. When *does* it happen? Primarily two scenarios: (1) during an initial infection, when the person hasn't developed antibodies yet, and (2) when the person is severely immunocompromised (this is not a state that you simply wouldn't notice - you'd be incredibly sick and/or dealing with an actual immune disorder). For the latter case, [this article](https://www.bashh.org/_userfiles/pages/files/resources/hsv_2014_ijstda.pdf) (top-right on page 7) notes that eczema can impair skin's immune protection, making autoinoculation more common. I welcome additional links on this general topic - resources are scant. \n\nThis process of immunity & protection has implications for transmission *between* people as well. As oral HSV-1 has been in decline, rates of genital HSV-1 have increased in response. I believe [this image](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331649399/figure/fig2/AS:735244898557964@1552307452759/Temporal-evolution-of-HSV-1-seroprevalence-in-the-US-a-Estimated-HSV-1-seroprevalence-in.png) captures the trend. In retrospect, oral HSV-1 was protecting lots of people from genital HSV-1. If two people both get cold sores, it's likely neither will ever get genital HSV-1 (low risk of oral-genital transmission).  \n\nThe real take-home here is that it's very important to be careful during an initial outbreak of oral HSV-1 (since getting it in your eye or your rectum would be drag). The first three months are the danger zone. After that, it's very unlikely that you'd give it to yourself, or to anyone else who already has HSV-1 *somewhere* on their body.",
