    "selftext": "Question regarding sourdough...\n\nIt is my understanding that wild-type yeast strains are region-specific. So a sourdough starter created in the Bronx would have a different array of critters than a starter created in Phoenix. This difference can (does?) result in a different flavor profile across the sourdough baked goods.\n\nHypothetically, I take an established Bronx sourdough and move it to Phoenix. I then use it regularly for two years (arbitrarily). Is it now repopulated with Phoenix yeast? Does it stay a Bronx sourdough because there is such a high concentration of Bronx yeast to begin with? Is there a rate associated with the turnover? Does it become a hybrid or something?\n\nI'm very curious how this works.\nThanks!",

Yeast is inhibited by the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli, and lactobacillus is inhibited by the ethanol made by the yeasts. These two microorganisms also have different temperature optima - yeast prefers lower temperatures than lactobacilli. \n\nSo I would expect differences in the cultivation conditions should shift the balance in the microbiome, and with it the flavor",
