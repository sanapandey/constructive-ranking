            "body": "A helium molecule is like any other mass. It is held on earth by gravity and if it has enough velocity (without hitting something, usually another gas particle) it will escape earth's atmosphere. As the probability of hitting something drops, depending on its velocity it may orbit earth, escape earth and stay in the solar system (orbit the sun) or simply go out into deep space.\nThe reason helium tends to escape is because it is lighter than any other gas (except free hydrogen which is rare). Since gas molecules are constantly colliding, the lighter ones are pulled down a little less by gravity so after many collisions will migrate to the upper atmosphere.",

In our solar system it varies some, but on average you will find a few particles per cubic centimeter. In intergalactic space we think this drops to a few particles per cubic meter. And it is theoretically possible that in places like Bootes Void it plummets even further, perhaps down to 1 particle every 100 cubic meters. \n\nAt any of these densities, if you cast a small enough net you can find a perfect vacuum. In our solar system we're talking less than a cubic centimeter. In intergalactic space, you could easily measure a 10cm x 10cm area and find no particles, a perfect vacuum. You're able to cast a larger net because the density is lower. \n\nOn the other extreme, you could cast a very small net and find a vacuum in the space between your own atoms. Atoms are after all 99% space. \n\nHopefully this has helped you wrap your head around it. A perfect vacuum is really just about measuring a small enough area. But the difference a perfect vacuum and an imperfect one can be as small as a single particle. And for most practical purposes that is not a big enough difference to matter. What does matter is when the amount of particles skyrockets. Air has around 10^19 particles per cubic centimeter.",

(Edit: Radiation splits O2 molecules that rise to the upper atmosphere, producing atomic and ionized oxygen. Atomic oxygen is the predominant form of oxygen above ~80 km, i.e., the thermosphere, and the exosphere from where atmospheric escape occurs.)\n\nEarth's (and Mars's and Venus's) atmospheric loss consists primarily of H/H+ and O/O+ (i.e., both neutral atoms and ions). For example, the total O and O+ losses for Earth in [Table A.1](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/06/aa32934-18/T1.html) of [Gunell et al. (2018)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/06/aa32934-18/aa32934-18.html) is 3.7 * 10^(25) particles per second = 0.98 kg per second = 31,000 tonnes per year. The total for hydrogen in the table is 6.9 * 10^26 particles per second = 1.1 kg/s, = 35,000 t / yr. However, those H losses do not include thermal (Jeans) escape, which is also significant for H, and of comparable magnitude to the total non-thermal H losses reported on the table--i.e., the total H escape is ~2 kg /s.\n\n[Gronoff et al. (2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JA027639) report similar quantities in Table 3. For O, that is 3.6 * 10^(25) / s = 0.96 kg/s = 31,000 t / year. For H, that is 6.8 * 10^(26) / s non-thermal escape, plus up to 6 * 10^(26) / s thermal (Jeans) escape near solar maximum, for a total of up to 1.28 * 10^(27) / s = 2.1 kg/s = 67,000 t / yr. (Of course, the reported rates will vary somewhat between sources, and the actual rates fluctuate with solar activity.)\n\nHelium losses are much less significant than H or O, and not quantified in either source. However, ~0.05 kg/s (~1,500 t / yr) is the correct order of magnitude. The majority of He escape is non-thermal escape, specifically [polar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_wind)/cap escape (outflow of ions via open field lines of Earth's magnetic field near the magnetic poles), like much of the H and O losses.\n\nu/GemmyGemGems",

Venus does not have a(n intrinsic) magnetic field, either, yet maintains  90x the atmosphere of Earth. Earth's relatively strong intrinsic magnetic field does protect Earth better from the solar wind than the weak, induced magnetic fields of Venus and Mars. But that is more or less balanced, in the present day, by losses that are caused by Earth's magnetic field, such that Venus, Earth, and Mars are losing atmosphere at similar rates. (Still other prpcesses, such as thermal escape, are not driven or protected from by magnetic fields at all.)\n\nMars did lose atmosphere much more rapidly than Earth or Venus in the distant past, and those losses were not replenished as much by volcanic outgassing. But that is mainly because Mars is a smaller planet with weaker gravity (i.e, lower escape velocity) and a cooler mantle (i.e., less volcanism later in its history), not because it lost its intrinsic magnetic field. Indeed, early Mars's intrinsic magnetic field may have done its atmosphere more harm than good.\n\n[Longer explanation with references](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mars/comments/1j536tc/comment/mgfmfbj/).",

                                                                    "body": "Although speed and collisions do relate other escape mechanisms (see below), what you are describing is thermal eacape, mainly [Jeans escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_escape). (Thermal escape also includes hydrodynamic escape, in which a hogj flux of Jeans escape drags along additional particles.) Very little of the helium escape from Earth is thermal/Jeans escape.\n\nFor Earth, while some He *can* escape via Jeans escape, those losses are negligible relative to other mechanisms. Jeans escape is only significant for hydrogen (primarily atomic H, originating from H2O molecules), and still, more H is lost through other escape mechanisms than through Jeans escape. Even for H Jeans escape, only a small part of the upper tail of the ([non-normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution) velocity probability distirbution (at the relevant temperature) is above Earth escape velocity (~11 km/s). But this is enough to cause a significant bleed of H. The relevant temperature is that of the exobase (base of the [exosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere) = top of the themrosphere). For Earth, the exobase is ~500-1000 km altitude. It varies a lot with solar activity, and strictly speaking (because the atmospher eis not well-mixed in the thermospehre and exosphere) with regard to the gas in question. Earth's exobase temperature is actually quite high, ~1000 K (although that also varies with solar activity).\n\nA rule of thumb is that a gas particle can escape via Jeans escape if the average speed (specifically the root mean square velocity\\*) exceeds 1/6 of escape velocity. [This figure](https://i.sstatic.net/xKa3b.png) (Figure 5.4 from this [textbook chapter](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/doc/Catling_and_Kasting_ch_5.pdf)) shows which gases can escape the planets of the solar system via Jeans escape, given their exobase temperature (surface temperature for the Moon and Mercury) and 1/6 the escape velocity. The lines are the RMS velocity of the gas. If a planet plots above the line, that gas is generally safe from Jeans escape. (The lower temperature of Venus's exobase, while counterintuitive, is not an error. The same CO2 that warms the lower atmosphere so much, by absorbing IR and re-radiating much of that downward, cools the upper atmosphere by re-radiating the rest of the energy outward.) Earth does plot below the helium line, so technically helium can escape in this way (albeit at a relatively low rate).\n\nBut there is a lot more to atmospheric escape than Jeans escape. For example, most helium escape from Earth occurs via polar wind (sometimes known as polar cap) escape. The [polar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_wind) is basically Earth's version of the solar wind. Neutral particles (e.g., He, H, O) get ionized (e.g., to He+, H+, O+) by solar UV and x-ray radiation. Streams of these ions, accelerated by Earth's magnetic and electric fields, escape via open field lines near the (magnetic) poles.\n\nA significant minority of helium escape (and roughly half of H escape) occurs via charge exchange. Coulomb collisions between ions greatly accelerate them, so that the effective temperature of the plasma is upwards of several thousand kelvins (far hotter than the neutral temperature). However (notwithstanding other means of escape such as polar wind), the ions remain largely trapped by Earth's magnetic field. Nevertheless, those ions can collide with the neutral counterpart (that is too slow to escape) and exchange charges, leaving a much slower ion and a much faster neutral (e.g., slow He + fast He+ ---> fast He + slow He+). The fast neutralized former ion can then escape, because it is no longer trapped by Earth's magnetic field. The ionized former neutral remains bound by both gravity and now Earth's magnetic field.\n\n(In large part because of the polar wind escape and cusp escape enabled by Earth having an intrinsic magnetic field, Earth is losing atmosphere at a similar rate to unmagnetized Venus and Mars. Yeah, the pop-sci idea of Mars's core cooling, losing its magnetic field, and as a result most of its atmosphere, is [pretty much a myth](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mars/comments/1j536tc/comment/mgfmfbj/).)\n\nu/barsknos",

The primary escape mechanism for helium from Earth is this He+ (along with H+ and O+) flowing out along open magnetic field lines near Earth's magnetic poles. This [polar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_wind) escapes Earth, and mixes with the solar wind.\n\nRegardless of the specific escape mechanism, helium and other gas particles escaping the atmosphere ultimately mix and merge with the solar wind. The solar wind itself is composed in part of He+ ions (alpha aprticles), altbough it is mostly hydrogen ions (protons). The solar wind travels outwards from the Sun and spreads out through the [heliosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere).\n\nThe heliosphere ends at the heliopause, where the pressure of the outgoing solar wind is balanced by that of the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium). There, the solar wind particles merge with the ISM. The heliosphere is teardrop shaped, with a spherical radius of ~120 AU (18 billion km), but a long (~350 AU / 52 billion km) tail extending in one direction. When it is said that the Voyager probes have left the solar system, this is referring to them having crossed the heliopause. (The gravitaitonal dominance of the Sun, i.e. including the scattered disk and Oort cloud, extends to several hundred to a thousand times the radius of the heliosphere.)",

            "body": ">does it move forever or collect in gas clouds eventually?\n\nSpace is sufficiently vast that it just basically spreads out, for all practical purposes, \"forever\". It's not aggregating into anything of higher density than the surrounding area, i.e. \"gas clouds\". It eventually becomes of low enough energy that diffusion is the dominant mechanism of movement, and this, coupled with the utter vastness and emptiness of space, means it's perpetually thinning even further out into and ultimately joining with the near-vacuum of deep space.\n\nMost estimates of the interstellar medium (the \"empty\" space between stars within the galaxy) are at around 10^(-22) kg/m^(3). This is fully a hundred times less dense than the 'vacuum' surrounding the Earth at its orbital distance from the Sun. The estimated volume of the galaxy is about 15 trillion cubic *light years*.\n\nThe point of the above paragraph being this: space is a HUGE empty sink for gases to escape into. For the practical purposes of considering gas loss from an individual planet, i.e. Earth, it is truly, effectively infinite. **The answer to \"where do the gases go\" is simply \"away\". And the amount of \"away\" in the universe is basically unfathomable.** It's not running out of space for those gases to diffuse into (that is, spread out into) any time soon. Or actually ever:\n\nIf you were to spread all the mass of the galaxy out within its volume equally, it would still have an average density of a little less than half that of the Karman Line, the conventional altitude used to designate the start of space over Earth's atmosphere. And of course, most of the universe is empty space between galaxies. There's a lot of room for gases to escape into...",
