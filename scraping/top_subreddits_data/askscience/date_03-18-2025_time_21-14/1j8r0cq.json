As discussed there, a relatively small percentage of meteorites are linked to either the Moon (e.g., [Marvin, 1983](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/GL010i009p00775)), Mars (e.g., [Treiman et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063300001057)), or [4 Vesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta) (e.g., [Thomas et al., 1997](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.277.5331.1492)) specifically. Bro\u017e et al. is arguing that a good chunk of the rest of the meteorites we have recovered (~70%) are from break ups of [Koronis family asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koronis_family), which is not surprising given the general long-standing idea that most meteorites come from the asteroid belt (see Bro\u017e et al. for various references to that effect).",

Looking up the meteorite referenced in this (NWA 7325) in journal articles highlights that while it is unique and clearly comes from some differentiated body (e.g., [Weiss et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17301620), [Archer et al., 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/maps.13261), [Yang et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/maps.13559)), the idea that it is sourced from Mercury has been pushed back on based on various inconsistencies (e.g., [Weber et al., 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/maps.12586), [Koefoed et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703716301375), [Cloutis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103517304773)), though the possibility still exists (e.g., [Sutton et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703717300509)). I.e., the most fair assessment is that some people used to think we have a meteorite from Mercury and now must people are unconvinced but the evidence is ambiguous enough that we're not really sure of the exact source of this meteorite.",

The orbital mechanics make those transfers much more unlikley, but I wonder if we've already found some without realizing their true origin.",

In order to perform a Hohmann transfer that skims the surface of the Sun requires reducing that by nearly 26,000m/s. A Hohmann transfer to the orbit of Neptune requires only increasing that velocity by 11,500m/s.\n\nIn fact, you could go to Pluto (~11,600 \u0394v), speed up to rendezvous and land on Pluto (~4,000 \u0394v) for a vacation, then take off and reduce your orbital velocity to zero (~5,500 \u0394v) to plunge directly into the center of the Sun all for significantly less \u0394v (fuel) than it takes to go directly to the Sun from Earth (21,100 \u0394v < 26,000 \u0394v). The drawback to taking to Pluto route is that it would take around 60 years total and the direct shot would only be 65 days.\n\nIf you are willing to wait around ten thousand years, you could send a rocket to just below escape velocity, then give it a tiny nudge once it's way out there to fall into the Sun and it would only require 12,300 \u0394v.",

The nearest stars are lightyears away, but a meteorite would just keep chugging along till a few thousand or million years later it got here. It wouldn't lose momentum unless acted on by another body's gravitational field, or was massively slowed by interstellar gas collisions. So if it was going fast enough to exceed it's system's escape velocity, it would keep going at speed, although it would arc relative to the galactic center's gravitational influence. If it hit something though it would likely vaporize. \n\nSomething from say a star on the far side of the galaxy would be a lot less likely. Even the high speed of something ejected from its system is peanuts compared to the speed things are spinning around the galactic core. It would take billions of years to catch up, and would likely get influenced by many other celestial bodies in between.\n\nSomething ejected from another galaxy would have to go incredibly fast to break its galaxy's escape velocity. Our sun goes around the galaxy at 514,000mph, which is pretty fast, but escape velocity for the galaxy itself is around 1,200,000mph. Something flung out of the galaxy at less than that speed would be pulled backwards by the gravity of the entire galaxy as a whole, and that pull would be greater than it's forward momentum. If it did reach escape speed, it would have to cross a vast amount of space to actually reach our galaxy. There are a number of tiny galaxies that orbit the milky way that could feasibly be broken away from, but the nearest galaxy similar in size to ours, Andromeda, is 2.5 million lightyears away. At that speed it would take something ejected there about 1.4 billion years to get here, and it would have to have left the system at just the right angle to actually arrive here. Andromeda is actually coming to say hello in about 5 billion years, so that will be interesting. \n\nEven if it made it into our solar system the odds of it hitting earth are really low, and the odds of it surviving atmospheric entry even lower. If it didn't pass right through the system, it would likely be captured by the sun or jupiter.",
