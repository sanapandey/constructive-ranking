    "selftext": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

Of course, cubes and tetrahedrons are fine, but the fit of a dodecahedron or how to pack three pyramids to make a cube is beyond my abilities.\n\nI have met other people who also have issues with 3D shapes, and at least one person also was born cross-eyed.

There are websites like Retraction Watch that are dedicated to tracking this process. However, if you mean (as your mentioning of Mengele suggests) that the study does not meet standards of ethical treatment of its subjects, the answer is usually... nothing. Consider the example of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the 1971 experiment at Stanford in which students were assigned as either guards or prisoners. The study is considered notrious today, but its lead author, Philip Zimbardo, used the experience to testify to Congress. While nothing happens to the papers per se, you will see future studies do not replicate their methods and instead adapt to the standards of their day.",

The best option for that is generally to just wait. It's possible to convert some radioactive materials to non-radioactive ones (e.g. by hitting them with neutrons) but that is very expensive.",

And the amounts of neutrons affect the atom's stability and sometimes also certain aspects, particularly in hydrogen with one neutron (heavy hydrogen) vs with two neutrons (tritium) in their differing uses for nuclear fusion, for example. \n\nElectrons with their negative charges will balance the positive charges of an equal amount of protons in an atom, but not always perfectly for every type of atom, and so from that imperfection the electrons are able to bond together atoms to form into molecules. The reasons go deeper into chemistry and if you want to explore into that further, you could start by looking up an explainer on covalent bonds and ionic bonds.",

Although these individuals lacked sufficient protective neutralizing an- tibody to completely inhibit measles infection at the time of exposure, they rapidly mounted an impressive neutralizing response that likely mitigated extensive viral replication and resulted in mild measles with minimal symptoms and few complications.\n\nLaboratory Characterization of Measles Virus Infection in Previously Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Individuals\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/41230505\n\nMeasles vaccination also seems to cross protect you from other illnesses.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2023.07.010",

One example is [The Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), which is widely used, well validated, and applicable across cultures.\n\nVariants and this model are being developed to this day, as well as tests that look at smaller factors within personality such as [psychopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad), [sociosexuality ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociosexual_Orientation_Inventory)etc.\n\nTo check whether a personality test is any good, look for things like test-retest reliability, validity of various types, correlations with other tests and real-world behaviours of interest.",

There are definitely caveats to it, not least of all that people can be dishonest. Other triangulating methods to get round this include getting others who know you to fill out a test rating you, and to measure actual behaviour and compare against the pencil-and-paper measures.\n\nA good personality test is *not* just how you perceive yourself. It should measure how you actually are.",

It is essentially the measurement of what we call \"latent variables\", or variables that represent patterns rather than physical objects.\n\nPsychometrics have Three Pillars: Reliability, Validity, and Standardization.\n\nReliability is the consistency with which we can measure a variable, Validity is how well we measure what we purport to measure, and standardization is how well the measures reflect the population of interest.\n\nIronically, the most popular personality test (Meyers-Briggs) meets no scientific standards at all.  It's free and it intuitively makes sense to people, but the numbers just don't support it, and the underlying organizing principle (Jungian theory) has not been used in practice for years.\n\nSome major tests with well developed numbers:\n\nNEO-PI-R: Well developed test of general (nonclinical) personality based on the Five Factor Theory (the most empirically supported model of personality).\n\nMMPI (different versions for different age ranges): an extensively studied test for clinical populations that have a wide range of primary and secondary scales that are extremely useful in psychodiagnostics\n\nMCMI: a widely used, well supported test of what used to be called \"Axis II\" functioning, often used in conjunction with the MMPI or PAI\n\nPAI: another widely used clinical measure that is directly mapped to the DSM, which has both advantages and disadvantages\n\nThere are literally hundreds of others, some focusing in on very specific things (like combat related trauma functioning or OCD symptoms), and other more generally.\n\nThey are also broken in to Objective and Projective categories, but that's a discussion for another day.",
