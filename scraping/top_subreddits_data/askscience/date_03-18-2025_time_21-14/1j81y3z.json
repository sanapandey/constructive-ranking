I study plant viruses and examine how we can use them to help stop citrus greening disease, which has wiped out hundreds of millions of citrus trees in the U.S. and worldwide. Citrus greening is spread by tiny insects called psyllids, which inject disease-causing bacteria into a tree\u2019s vascular system. My lab along with the company that I co-founded, Silvec Biologics, have developed an approach to combat this disease by infecting trees with a virus that delivers antibiotic agents to the location where the bacteria live.\n\nAsk me all your questions about plant virology and citrus greening! I\u2019ll be on from **1:30 to 3:30 p.m. ET (17:30--19:30 UT) on Wednesday, March 12**.\n\nAnne Simon is a professor of cell biology and molecular genetics at the University of Maryland. Her lab uses small plus-strand RNA viruses to study how viruses move and infect plants. She is trying to understand how infection by some viruses makes the plants more receptive to infection by other pathogens. \n\nAnne's work has attracted the attention and financial support of leading institutions, including the NIH, USDA and NSF, and her expertise was tapped by Chris Carter, creator of the cult favorite television series \"The X-Files.\u201d Anne served as science adviser for the series and received story writing credit for the popular episode, \u201cMy Struggle II,\u201d which aired in 2016 and allowed her to share her knowledge and passion for virology with millions of fans.  She is also the author of the book \u201cThe Real Science Behind The X-Files\u201d.\n\nAnne received a B.A. in biology from the University of California, San Diego, and a Ph.D. in genetics from Indiana University. She was elected fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2014.\n\nOther links:\n\n+ [Simon Lab website](https://simona065.wixsite.com/simon-lab)\n+ [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kVcFLpgAAAAJ&hl=en)\n+ [CMNS article](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/news/super-sleuthing-save-citrus)\n\nUsername: [/u/umd-science](https://www.reddit.com/u/umd-science/)",

If there was a way of preventing it, we would not be in the mess we are in right now. What is important is that if you are not in a heavy citrus greening area and your tree does become infected and you see the symptoms or the psyllids, it is important to destroy the tree so that the psyllids feeding on it will not spread it to other trees. In Los Angeles, thousands of backyard trees are infected, and they are very worried in California that it will spread up the coast.",

It works well for a few years, and we believe we have discovered ways to make it work much better for much longer.  In the decade that this has been studied, the virus has never been found to have escaped the trees it was placed in. The USDA has done an extensive analysis of the data and has concluded that there isn't a risk to nontarget plants or the environment. Obviously, this is very important. In addition, the virus only infects citrus and this strain causes no harm to the tree. Without a solution to citrus greening, there will be no more citrus.",

They do this because the cell wall keeps viruses from bursting out of cells like some animal viruses can do. All plant viruses (with one exception) encode at least one movement protein, which is required for transiting plasmodesmata. The one exception is a virus we found called umbra-like viruses. Many of these viruses use a host protein for movement. It would be difficult to speed up how a virus does things naturally. For mature citrus trees, we are going to try topping the trees because the virus likes to move quickly into new growth.",
