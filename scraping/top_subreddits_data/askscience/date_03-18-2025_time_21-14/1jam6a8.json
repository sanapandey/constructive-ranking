The normal flu vaccine has historically been anywhere from 8% to 80% effective, averaging 60%, while an mRNA flu vaccine would pretty much always be at least 90% effective (I don't quite remember the number. It might have been 95%).",

It will even be possible for them to update the strains for every new batch. \n\nThat alone is huge, but then they're also looking at it and figuring that they can fit 10 or 15 strains in a single shot, compared to the 3 or 4 strains in the current vaccines.\n\nPfizer is currently looking for volunteers for phase 3 combined flu/covid trials, which leads to imagining a future where we get a single shot that deals with 5 or 10 or 20 separate diseases, which would be sooo much better than getting 10 different shots at once.",

It's a super specialized field, they raise them in sterile conditions with multiple layers of \"germproofing\" security (pressurized coops to keep outside air out, workers who wear hazmat suits and take special showers and go through other sterilization procedures before interacting with the chickens, etc.) and it's very expensive. And that's normal, it's not special procedures because of bird flu. It's just a whole separate market from regular eggs. I suspect those chickens are pretty much the least likely birds in the world to be affected, it will probably be OK.",
