            "body": "A random cloud of orbiting debris will naturally settle into a ring over time. \n\nThe reason is that as the bits of debris interact with each other, they trade momentum. \n\nImagine two chunks of rock are orbiting in different directions, like one at a \"northeast\" angle and the other \"southeast.\" When they bump into each other, they both get deflected. Both wind up going more directly east, not moving as far north or south anymore. \n\nNow, expand that same idea to a whole cloud of millions of rocks and dust particles. Let it run for a hundred million years. Over all those trillions of trillions of collisions and interactions, the orbital momentum of those particles eventually start to average out. You wind up with most of them traveling in similar orbits, all in about the same direction, whatever was about average for the original cloud as a whole. \n\nIf you were able to watch it happen, you would see the cloud flatten out and develop into a ring structure. \n\nSaturn's rings are especially thin because they are close in orbit to a couple of its tiny moons. The gravity of those moons tends to keep the particles in a more stable orbit and stop them from drifting away from the ring.",

Due to the above mentioned reason about stuff averaging out to orbit in the same direction. \n\nSomething can get captured and start orbiting in a random direction. But then it will be subject to the same forces that subject everything else to orbit in the same direction and will be unstable (and is likely to either eject back out of orbit or fall back into the body it's orbiting. It may during the process impact the orbit of other stuff but once it's stabilised (which can take millions of years) everything will generally be in the same plane again)",

If it did happen it would not last long.\n\nPlanets and moons form out of a big cloud of gas and dust, which collapses into bigger objects. Because of the interactions I mentioned above, you would not have different parts of the cloud moving in opposite directions from each other. Moons all tend to go in the same direction. \n\nIt would theoretically be possible for some outside body to be captured into orbit and become a moon orbiting the other way. But that would not be a stable situation, again for the same reasons. Those moons would have to pass near each other at some point in their orbits. They would exchange momentum, and wind up averaging out, and eventually all moons that remain in orbit would be going in similar directions again.",

The moon's tides pull at the substance of the planet, at the same time the tidal bulges pull at the moon. The interaction slows down the moon's orbit and also, less noticeably, slows the rotation of the planet. \n\nWe know of one retrograde satellite where we can watch this happening: the moon Triton, which orbits Neptune in the opposite direction that Neptune rotates. We do think Triton was originally an independently orbiting object that wound up being captured by Neptune. \n\nTriton's orbit is very, very gradually slowing and shrinking because of this effect. We predict that about 3.5 billion years from now, it will get so close to Neptune that the planet's gravity will overcome Triton's own gravity. Tidal forces will pull the whole moon right apart. Some of the bits will fall into the planet and the rest will form a large debris ring. \n\nI imagine it will be spectacular.\n\nThere are other retrograde satellites in our solar system, but all those are much smaller and much further away from their primaries. That means tidal effects are too small to cause deceleration on a timescale we can measure.",

Gravity pulls more strongly on nearby things. On Earth, the tides from the moon happen because the moon pulls most strongly on water directly beneath it, compared to water that is further way. \n\nThe way the math works out, tides are stronger when the bodies are closer together. That is, the force of gravity is stronger, but also the *difference* in gravity is proportionally larger. If the moon becomes half as far away from the planet, tidal force is 8 times greater. \n\nThe force doesn't just affect water. It affects rock and air and everything else. And it goes both ways, with the planet and moon both affecting each other. \n\nIn the case of Triton, Neptune's gravity is pulling most strongly on the parts of the moon that are closest to the planet. It pulls least strongly on parts furthest away. As the distance between the bodies shrinks, that force difference is always getting bigger and bigger. \n\nThere's a distance limit, where the planet's tidal force pulling away at the rock becomes greater than the moon's own gravity trying to pull it together. That is called the Roche limit. Once the moon passes inside that limit, its gravity can no longer hold it together against the tidal forces, and it disintegrates. \n\nThe pieces don't fall straight to the planet because they are still traveling the same velocity as the moon was. That means they are moving sideways too quickly to fall straight in, so they stay in orbit.",

It's mostly because Charon and Pluto are about the same size and rotate about a point outside of Pluto, meaning that Pluto does not have enough mass to successfully clear its neighborhood in its orbit, instead forming a binary system with Charon.\n\nThe qualifications for \"planet\" are:\n\n* You orbit a star, but are not a satellite\n\n* Have enough mass to be nearly spherical\n\n* Have successfully cleared the neighborhood of your orbit.\n\n\"Clearing the neighborhood\" is the actual terminology (though, dynamical dominance is also used so we can have actual technical terminology) is where you have enough mass that you are basically the dominant object in your orbit--everything either orbits you (the barycenter of the orbit is within your body) or is in your Lagrange points (at least temporarily stable areas in your orbit). This is the criteria that determines a dwarf planet from a \"regular\" planet.\n\nThe exact shape of your orbit isn't a criteria. Indeed, Pluto's orbit is still elliptical, it's just eccentric, meaning it's very elliptical, whereas for instance the Earth's orbit is basically circular, and inclined, meaning it orbits at a noticeable angle relative to the Sun's rotation). Pluto's orbit is actually so eccentric it is closer to the Sun than Neptune in parts of the orbit.",

There it will naturally contribute to any ring structure the planet has. \n\nBecause rings dissipate so very slowly, it wouldn't take much material input to maintain a faint ring for a very long time.

Outer portions of the cloud coalesce into moons and perhaps rings, which continue their orbit in the plane of the disc. \n\nThere is nothing special about gravity that attracts moons to the equator.\n\nA moon or ring that doesn't form in the same way will not be located above the equator. A good example is Triton, moon of Neptune.  Triton didn't form from the same cloud as Neptune did. It started out as a separately orbiting object and was captured by Neptune's gravity. So, its orbit is very different, being titled significantly off Neptune's equatorial plane and moving in the opposite direction from the planet's rotation.",

It explains that momentum is involved, but not *why* the momentums always end up cancelling out on average to result in rings.\n\nThe fact is, this happens primarily because we live in three dimensions, and that has mathematical consequences which then have physical consequences.\n\nIn three dimensions, there are two important and relevant mathematical facts. 1: Every plane can be described by a single vector perpendicular to that plane. 2: You cannot have two planes in 3D space that do not intersect.\n\nThe first is important because it turns out that angular momentum can be represented as a vector perpendicular to the plane in which the rotation occurs. The second is important because this means we can now add up the rotation vectors of a *collection* of objects to get their *total* rotation...and that total rotation vector will always uniquely define a specific plane of rotation unless it is the zero vector (since it has no defined direction), but the odds of that happening in nature are essentially zero.\n\nThe net result of these two facts is that all collections of rotating objects have a net angular momentum which shares specifically a *plane*, not a *sphere.* If we lived in 2D this would also be true but trivial because everything lives in that plane (objects can only rotate CW or CCW in 2D spaces.) if we lived in 4D, this would NOT be true, as it IS possible in 4D and higher spaces to have two planes that do not intersect, but also aren't parallel. This is exactly the same as how lines in (flat) 2D space must either cross or be parallel, but lines in 3D space can be neither crossing nor parallel.\n\nNow, add in the final critical ingredient from physics: gravity. Under gravitational attraction, the particles orbiting the planet (or star, or anything really) are bound to a sphere around the planet. But, as we just observed, there is a net angular momentum for all of those things. Things that collide and get angular momentum changes *away* from the plane of rotation will either get that change cancelled out later, or will get ejected from the orbit, removing angular momentum that might oppose this process. Hence, over time, the combination of how momentum is transferred, the attractive force of gravity, and the nature of 3D space, *all* rotating things eventually \"flatten out\" into a disk shape, not a sphere, usually with a big mostly-spherical lump in the center. That's why solar systems are (mostly) flat, why galaxies are (mostly) flat, why large moons tend to all orbit in a common plane around gas giants, etc. Physics and math *force* this result to occur.",

            "body": "You need to start early and with the big picture. Planets and the moons around them coalesced out of the same rotating cloud of material as the sun. During this process, the cloud \u201cpicks\u201d a rotational axis from gravity pulling on all of the components: there\u2019s a net final rotation. \n\nDue to conservation of momentum, they shared angular momentum, so as the individual planets got pulled together by gravity, they spun faster but in the same orientation (ice skater pulling in their arms is a common example). So all the planets (and the asteroids between Earth and Mars) now orbit on the same plane. \n\n(The fact that Pluto has an out-of-plane orbit is one strike against it being called a planet. The fact that many comets and other objects farther out have eccentric orbits suggests their origin is extra-solar, or at least that they have been disturbed by passing extra-solar objects in the past.)\n\nSo what about the moons? While they typically coalesced out of the same materials there can be some variation in angle of the orbital plane with moons because they are light enough to be easily disturbed, but the gravitational pull of the generally bulkier equatorial girth of planets tends to pull them back towards an equatorial orbit. So even \u201ccaptured moons\u201d which might be stray asteroids or Oort Cloud denizens will end up in approximately the orbital plane.\n\nRings are thought to be caused by an impact between orbiting moons, or a moon that has gotten too close to its massive planet that gets pulled apart. These would already be in the orbital plane, so the fragments would tend to be on average in that plane, and over time get pulled by the other fragments into a thin disc.",
