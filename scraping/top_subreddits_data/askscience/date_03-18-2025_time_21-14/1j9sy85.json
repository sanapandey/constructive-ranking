It annoys my wife because she repeatedly says \"it's not the bubbles that clean the dishes\".  \n\nTo my mind though, the amount of bubbles a given dish soap produces gives an indication of how well it works as a surfactant which surely affects how well it will clean food off the dishes.  \n\nSo who is right?  Do the bubbles matter or not?",

            "body": "Actually, you're both kind of right.\n\nAs the other answers say here, the properties that produce bubbles are different than the ones that actually clean the dishes, so your wife is right, making a bubblier soap doesn't make it clean better.\n\nBut your question is whether the bubbliness is related *in any way*, and actually, it kind of is.\n\nHow many bubbles you get is partly related to the soap itself, but partly related to the water quality. \"Harder\" water (meaning water with higher mineral content) inhibits the ability of soap to clean, and also impacts the ability to form bubbles. This is a clear enough effect that early tests for hard water involved adding the water to a soap solution, until the solution wouldn't bubble anymore (more precise methods have since been developed). \n\nSo, it's likely that people have historically noticed that, when their soaps didn't bubble up, they also didn't clean very well. That's because of their water quality, not because a of problem with the soap, but the association became well enough established that dish soap companies deliberately add foaming agents.\n\nOf course, they only add those foaming agents for the soaps you use for hand-washing, because (I can tell you from personal experience) putting that soap into a dishwasher is *not* a good idea. And yet non-foaming dishwasher soap works just fine, because the foaming is an indicator, at best, not something that actually cleans.",

                    "body": "Just a little additional information for people who are interested (your answer is excellent).\n\nDish soap like dawn uses SDS for the main cleaning agent, and it is foamy. SDS is a really effective detergent on its own. But, when hand washing the bubbles are actually a detriment to cleaning. When you put a dish into the sink and scrub it, soil is dissolved by the detergent and distributed along the air-water interface (And into micells in the bulk solution). The bubbles are a HUGE air-water interface surface and hold a large amount of soil. So, when you remove the dish from the sink you drag it up through a layer of soil that redeposits on the surface of the dish. \n\nBut as you said people associate foam with cleaning power, so the psychological benefit of seeing the foam outweighs the minor problem it causes.\n\nAuto-dish detergent in its simplest form is a base that will turn the fat and oil on your dishes into soap. This is water soluble and will also dissolve more soil, since it is soap. Soap made from fat isn't very foamy (think of ivory soap). As you said, you don't want foam in your dishwasher, but you also can't use dishwasher detergent to hand wash because your hands will also turn into soap at the pH and temperature needed for it to function properly.",

These contribute a bit to the surfactant action, but much to the bubbliness. The stuff you put in your laundry and dishwasher is more concentrated and doesn't bubble (because if it did bubble it would bubble out the machine and all over your floor). It has chemical additives specifically to prevent foaming, just as your hand soap or dish soap has additives to make it foam more.",

Char on wood is actually hydrophobic, which make it difficult to get the water we put on a fire to soak into the material we are trying to stop from burning (or more accurately pyrolyzing). The surfactant changes the surface tension of the water to allow it to penetrate through the char better.\n\nBut, related to the bubbles question you asked, in the fire service we specifically look for foaming agents in surfactants because the bubbles create a barrier between flammable materials and heat and/or oxygen. In smaller fire extinguishers (water cans) we generally use a dish soap like Dawn to supplement the water in the can, which provides some better water penetration into the material, but in larger applications we will intentionally aerate the water/soap solution to create a thick foam which can be applied to burning materials or materials we want to protect from catching on fire. \n\nFoams are also used to fight flammable liquid fires to apply a vapor barrier between the flammable liquid and atmospheric oxygen.",

There are ways to make cleaning agents that foam more or less. But surfactants clearly has a big role to play in binding oils to water (the cleaning property) AND causing bubbles.\n\nPeople trying to say anything different are just plain wrong and ignorant of the very basics of soaps.\n\nThere are off course nuances and advanced chemistry the deeper you dive. [Start by looking at the wikipedia page for surfactants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant)\n\nEdit: note that it is not the bubbles that clean your dishes, but surfactants that binds oil to water so that you can make fat connect to water and clean it off. Those surfactants properties also make the dish water bubbly if you introduce air.\n\nedit 2. For example fire fighters can use surfactants to mix into the water to create foam (bubbles). Those are specialized surfactants that has been developed to create as good and as strong foam as possible. Those surfactants are probably not the best in the world for cleaning dishes, but are the best in the world at creating foam. So there's **not a 1:1 correlation** of \"bubbliness\" and cleaning properties. But on the other hand those surfactants are better at cleaning dishes than just plain water. So \"bubbliness\" is **related in some way** to cleaning properties.",
