They are coming south too late and getting cold stunned on the way down as an example. While many birds often still follow day length. Issue here is their food sources are hatching earlier because they are triggered by temperature. TLDR it depends",

Different animals do this differently. Some may use nighttime temperature cues, some might use magnetic clues for direction-finding, some the solar angle. Some might use cues from the plants around them, which are themselves reacting in a seasonal way to the environment.",

            "body": "Not a migration expert but I know some tid bits from teaching animal behavior in a biology course,\u00a0\n\n\nWhen animal behavior is studied, the term 'instinct' refers to a behavior that the animal doesn't have to learn- it's essentially pre-programmed in. However, all behavior is usually in response to an environmental stimulus, even if it is instinctive. So I suspect the answer to your question is both: it's instinct and environmental cues.\n\n\nAnother interesting environmental cue is the length of a day. I know that dairy animals tend to produce the most milk leading up to the summer solstice (longest day of year) and production wanes after that. Perhaps that's another cue in some migratory animals arsenal!",
