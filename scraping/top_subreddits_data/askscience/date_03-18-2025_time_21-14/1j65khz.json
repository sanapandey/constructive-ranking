            "body": "Let's assume you have a high-quality telescope, so it is operating at the diffraction limit, the best that an optical system of a certain size, operating at a certain wavelength can do. Because the Moon has no atmosphere, we don't have to worry about atmospheric distortion - it affects things looking down at Earth a lot less, because the distortion is happening at the object, rather than just before the telescope, as [this diagram by Randall Munroe of xkcd illustrates](https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/32/hubble_distortion.png)\n\nThen, the resolution R, in terms of the smallest detail you can see, depends only on three things: The wavelength of light \u03bb you are seeing, the diameter d of the telescope, and how far away D you are from what you are looking at, with the formula being R=1.22\\*D\\*\u03bb/d. Your telescope diameter is 8 inches, so about 20 cm, for the wavelength let's assume 600 nm as an average for visible light, and the distance is about 380000 km.\n\nPutting in those numbers, we get a resolution of 1.4 km. So you won't be able to make out any rivers, but you would be able to see the shapes of the continents and all the major islands and lakes, and especially if you are looking at the night side of Earth you will be able to make out major cities by their illumination.",

                            "body": "It's common to wonder about this definition of resolution. Due to the wave nature of light, it's not possible to create a perfect pinpoint image of a perfect pinpoint source. And, in fact, two pinpoint sources sufficiently close together will look like a single pinpoint in the image. When OP mentioned the magic words, \"diffraction limited,\" they meant that the optics are so good, that the image created by the telescope has defects only due to the wave nature of light, which dwarf the defects due to any undulations in the surface of the telescope's focussing mirror.\n\nFor a circular mirror aperture, the angular resolution of a telescope is R = 1.22\u03bb/d in radians, where \u03bb is the wavelength and d is the diameter of the aperture (use the same units for the wavelength and the diameter). That formula is hard to derive, and there is a different for different mirror shapes.\n\nIf two point sources of light are separated by an angle of less than R radians at the telescope, then they cannot be \"resolved.\" They look like a single point. If the angle is bigger than R radians, then they can be \"resolved.\" They look like two points. Since \"resolution\" in modern times has taken the meaning of how many pixels make up an image, sometimes this attribute of optics is called \"resolving power\" instead. Roughly speaking, you can see things that have an angular size of R radians, but that's not really 100% true. You can see points of light just fine, but they'll look like disks with an angular size of R radians.\n\nTo turn the resolution back into meters on the Earth's surface, OP multiplied R by the D, the distance from the moon to the earth.\n\nWikipedia has an [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution) about angular resolution.",

You can even differentiate against the two by looking at time dependant flickering while lights are turned on or off.\n\n If you pretend your brain is the computer that normally does this and you're an alien astronomer that stares at the earth continuously, you could probably pick up some extra detail this way.",

I imagine during the day you'd be able to resolve large things like hurricanes and probably even things like the Rockies, the Himalayas, The Great Lakes, etc. We can plainly see lunar craters 10-miles across from Earth, so anything that size(ish) I'd imagine could be resolved. Probably much better seeing from the moon. :)",
