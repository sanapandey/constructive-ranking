            "body": "For every different scent you can pick up, there is a dedicated small part of the brain (in the olfactory bulb) that sends nerves to the lining of the nose, which nerves have a unique receptor for that scent molecule. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_receptor. \nHumans have a few hundred of these, dogs have tens of thousands.  As the sense of smell is processed in the brain, the brain can detect further things: combinations of multiple scents, or changes in the intensity.",

I was just wondering one other thing, how does our nose determine what is a 'sensitive' smell like if I just sniffed vanilla extract or something very spicy, why does it create a burning sensation in my nose, but 9/10 smells don't?\n\nSame with how colognes, perfumes, and our favorite foods create a very very pleasant smell. It's just a bit curious how our brain decides what smells it likes and dislikes and why nice smells give that soft tingly feeling in our nose, while bad smells give that burning putrid feeling.",

Unfortunately Boranes (Boron containing molecules) smell very similar to that ( the smallest stable of such is Decaborane ) yet contain no Sulfur atoms.\n\nAlso Chirality or handedness of molecules needs to play a part in any model because for example L-Carvone in Spearmint leaves smells completely different from D-Carvone from caraway seeds, yet the two molecules contain the same atoms in the same arrangement only differing by being mirror images of each other.",

Whatever burns your eye will also burn your nose. Pepper activates heat receptors that are on all your sensory nerves, not just specific ones. In case of vanilla extract, probably the alcohol that the vanilla aroma is dissolved in, creates the burning sensation.  \nI don\u2019t know what determines if a smell is pleasant or not. You can certainly learn to associate scents with good or bad things. I imagine some associations are innate, such as disgust from rotten smells. But then again, some cultures favor rotten smells in food.  \nFinally, smell is a very adaptive sense, meaning that after a couple minutes you stop experiencing the smell, even if the scent is still present.

This would mean thousands of different receptors to smell the world around us. \n\nTurns out most smell receptors have varying degrees of affinity for many different types of smells. The brain then processes the signals sent to it from multiple different receptors. A surprisingly large percentage of the human genome is dedicated to smell. It\u2019s important. \n\nOne of the surprising features of human smell is our sensitivity to petrichor, or \u201crain/wet earth.\u201d Humans use a lot of water and will need to find it when we travel long distances. Out sensitivity to this smell far surpasses the sensitivity sharks have for blood, so even though our noses are small, we have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom, but just for that one smell.",

Every molecule can thus activate several different receptor types to varying degrees. The brain recognizes, learns and interprets the pattern of activation a molecule causes. Therefore, even though we have many different smell receptors, we can differentiate many more substances than we have receptor types. Dogs and humans differ in that dogs have more receptor cells, not necessarily more types, so they are more sensitive. Smells differ with concentration , because at low concentration, the weakest receptor answers may not be there, whereas at high concentrations, some receptors may be overloaded. Both changes the pattern of relative intensity between receptor types that the brain interprets, leading to different sensations. \nPerception of smell is really fascinating, especially the hardwired analysis and information processing.",
