This assault has taken many forms, including rescinding existing grants to academics, proposing dramatic cuts in future funding budgets, unilateral and extreme changes to parts of budgets like \"indirect cost rates\", and massive and indiscriminate firings of federal scientists. These efforts that if successful, will hobble not just scientific research \u2013 and universities more broadly \u2013 in the short term, but effectively destroy one of the most successful and productive environments for generating knowledge ever created. We are already seeing numerous tangible impacts, including:\n\n-  [**Large numbers of layoffs of federal scientists**](https://www.science.org/content/article/wrecking-ball-rfk-jr-moves-fire-thousands-health-agency-employees);\n\n- [**Abandoned research**](https://www.science.org/content/article/abandoned-crops-fired-scientists-agricultural-research-hit-u-s-foreign-aid-freeze); \n\n- [**Abrupt ends to numerous clinical trials**](https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-face-impossible-decisions-u-s-aid-freeze-halts-clinical-trials); and \n\n- [**Shutting down of new graduate admissions at universities**](https://vanderbilthustler.com/2025/02/15/graduate-student-admissions-temporarily-paused-as-university-monitors-federal-funding/), amongst others. \n\nAt the same time, much of this is flying under the radar because of a general lack of context for what these changes mean, their downstream implications, or even what some of these things are. For example, what are \"indirect costs\" and what happens if they get slashed? At the same time, there is a fair amount of disinformation being used to cloud many of these issues. /r/AskScience has put together the information below to try to provide a window into how the funding and performance of science in the USA works and just how devastating and damaging the efforts to curtail it are, so that you may engage with discussions of these issues prepared with facts. Finally, as we discuss at the bottom of this post, we encourage you all to do what you can to help push back against these changes and the misinformation that surrounds them. \n \n---\n\n**What is a grant? How are they selected?**\n\nToday, a lot of scientific research and development within the US is funded through grants, which often come from government funding. The development of grant programs administered by government entities like the National Science Foundation (NSF) or the National Institute of Health (NIH) mostly occurred after World War II. For both [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/about/history#why-was-nsf-formed-bf0) and [NIH](https://history.nih.gov/display/history/WWII%20Research%20and%20the%20Grants%20Program), a large part of the motivation for developing grant programs was the recognition of the huge economic benefit provided by scientific research, something that became extremely clear during the WWII period where the government funded war effort also funded a lot of science, but also that relying on private foundations to fund scientific research was extremely limiting. It wasn\u2019t just that these private foundations had limited money, but more importantly that it restricted \u201ccuriosity driven\u201d science, as in science which was funded based on what particular philanthropists were interested in rather than what scientists were interested in or what might benefit society as a whole. There are different grants depending on the subject area, and they fund everything from pharmaceutical development to earthquake research. At present, other funding sources can include private organizations and companies, although the public sector now funds the vast majority of scientific research and development at universities in the US. Public and private funding are not fungible, either: [privately-funded research is more likely to be patented, with the patent held by a private company](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28160).   \n\nThe process for receiving this funding starts with a proposal to the funding institution, which is often a federal agency like the NSF or NIH. Within each agency, there are different \u201cprograms\u201d that effectively represent different pots of money. Each program will have a theme and particular mission and scientists choose which program best fits the research they want to propose. Many of these themes are extremely broad, e.g., [the NSF program for studying the structure of the Earth](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/spse-structure-physics-solid-earth), giving scientists wide latitude to follow past innovations and their own interests in developing a proposal. That is to say, while the themes of the programs are defined by the agency, the actual research that is proposed and done, if the grant is awarded, is dictated by the scientists applying to the funding opportunities. Because funds are limited, these grants are highly competitive and developing the proposals \u2013 typically lengthy documents outlining the scientific rationale, prior work, and proposed new work, with numerous ancillary documents describing how data will be stored and distributed, graduate students will be mentored, and extremely detailed budgets with justifications for proposed expenses \u2013 is extremely time-consuming.  \n\nOne of the hallmarks of most federally funded proposals are that they are evaluated by other scientists in that field through a mixture of \u201cad-hoc reviews\u201d, where the proposal is read by other scientists and critiqued, and during \u201creview panels\u201d where a group of scientists are assembled to go through the reviews, review the proposals themselves, and then rank them based on the novelty, feasibility, and importance of the proposed work. Those rankings are then used by program officers, who are employees of their respective agencies (e.g., NSF or NIH), but almost exclusively were also practicing scientists within their respective disciplines before taking positions as program officers, to choose which grants are funded. At all steps of the process, funding decisions are made exclusively by scientists, not politicians or bureaucrats. These scientists are independent, not affiliated with the funding agencies. \n\n---\n\n**Why does it matter if active grants or proposal reviews are temporarily paused?**\n\nThere have been any number of [news articles](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/) about various pauses on either the review of new grant proposals or the active grants having funds frozen. Some of these are still in place, some of them are rescinded, and some of them appear to be approaching a form of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, both alive and dead depending on who is talking.  \n\nIt may be hard to understand why scientists are concerned about \"temporary\" pauses. One major reason \u2013 and why \"temporary\" is in scare quotes \u2013 is that in most of these cases, it's not actually clear how temporary these pauses really are. Beyond that, large portions of federally funded research are devoted to paying undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. These students and early career scientists are the backbone of modern science, not only doing a huge amount of the current work, but also are the future generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. For many of them, short delays in funding can be the [difference between them being able to stay in their chosen careers or having to leave](https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/trump-funding-freeze-national-science-foundation-suspends-salary-payments/).  Additionally, because each proposal represents huge time investments to prepare and the \"normal\" turnaround time between submission and decision is 6 months to a year, short-term delays compound an already slow process, leading to higher chances that students and other early career scientists who are living paycheck to paycheck will suddenly find themselves without any funding. Ultimately, short-term delays are bad enough, as they will disproportionately impact the next generation of scientists, but as we've seen, there are darker clouds on the horizon...\n\n---\n\n**Why are attacks on broadening participation in science damaging?**\n\nFederal research grants often require specific sections of the proposal that discuss how other branches of science or society as a whole might benefit from the outcomes of the proposed work. For example, NSF proposals have a section called [Broader Impacts](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/learn/broader-impacts) that is required to be included by various US Congressional acts. At its core, broader impacts are meant to reflect how the project will benefit society as a whole, and these portions of funded projects often involve initiatives to promote human health and well-being, advances to key technologies or infrastructure, and a variety of efforts to improve STEM education and broaden participation in STEM fields, especially within groups which have been historically underrepresented or excluded from the disciplines. That means that while the executive order calling for a blanket halt on grant funding was rescinded, many grants remain in limbo while their broader impact sections are assessed to determine if they conflict with the still-standing executive order against federal support of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. \n\nWhile demographics vary between STEM disciplines, many fields have struggled to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, e.g., the [geosciences](https://www.americangeosciences.org/citations/closing-geoscience-talent-gap). At the same time, several are facing critical job gaps in the near future, as retirees in key fields are slated to outstrip new graduates available to replace them. Broadening participation in these disciplines meets a tangible societal need, and from a strictly pragmatic perspective, science as a whole benefits from the inclusion of people with diverse backgrounds, training, and experiences as shown in a variety of investigations across different fields (e.g., [this](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.3000421), or [this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1700616114), or [this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2200841119), or [this](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0278043) \u2013 and many more.\n\n---\n\n**What would proposed funding cuts do to science in the USA?**\n\nThis is really hard to answer. There is often a large difference between what US presidential administrations ask for in their budgets versus what Congress actually funds, and generally the US Congress has been unwilling to enact large cuts to major science funding agencies like the NSF and NIH. That being said, proposals like those from the Trump administration [asking for a >60% cut to the NSF budget](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/white-house-budget-proposal-could-shatter-the-national-science-foundation/) would, without a doubt, cripple scientific research in the US if anything like this was adopted by Congress. Decades of cell lines would be lost, thousands of animals would be euthanized, and sensitive chemicals would be wasted, all in the name of \"saving money.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also critical to remember that a lot of both basic and applied science is not just done by federal grants to academics, but also by federally employed scientists working for agencies and organizations like the [NIH, CDC, NASA, USGS, FWS, USFS, NPS, EPA, NWS, NOAA, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_research_and_development_agencies). The waves of [firings hitting these and other organizations](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/14/trump-musk-purge-thousands-federal-workers-fired/78606349007/) are going to further erode the scientific capacity of the US and have [large impacts beyond simply the advancement of science](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-team-looks-to-drastically-cut-noaa-staff-and-budget/)\n\n---\n\n**What are \"indirect costs\" and why does it matter if they're cut by a large amount?**\n\nMost grant proposals contain requests for both \"direct\" and \"indirect\" costs in the budgets they submit to agencies. Direct costs are largely what they sound like: the direct costs of doing the proposed work, which might include salaries for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs working on the project, along with costs associated with analyses, field work, consumables (like chemicals), etc. That is, direct costs are typically costs that are tied *directly* to that proposed work and that proposed work only. On the other hand, indirect costs, sometimes called \"facilities and administration\" or just \"F&A\", are the costs of essential services, resources, facilities and infrastructure, or staff support that is not tied to an individual proposal, but still need to be there for research to actually happen. There is a dizzying array of things covered at least in part by F&A, including, but not limited to:\n\n- **Paying utility bills:** It\u2019s hard to do research if the lights are off, equipment has no power and there's no heating or cooling;\n\n- **Hazardous chemical and biological waste management:** Someone has to deal with the messes that are created by running various experiments;\n\n- **Libraries:** Journal subscriptions are expensive, but it's nearly impossible to stay current in your field and do good science without them;\n\n- **Internet services:** It should go without saying that doing a lot of modern science would be impossible without consistent internet connection;\n\n- **Administrative services:** Federally funded research is bound by an array of regulations. Scientists are not trained in navigating these regulations, and without administrative support, they would lose a large amount of time to work well outside their expertise, or lose their funding due to violation of these regulations; \n\n- **Facilities and equipment maintenance:** It\u2019s hard to do good science if your fume hoods aren\u2019t safe to use, your growth chambers don\u2019t maintain the correct temperature and humidity, and all your machines are broken;\n\n- **Animal facilities and care:** While some portions of this may be covered by direct costs, they are often covered by indirect costs, meaning that lab animals can be affected, or they can even be euthanized;\n\n- **Updating general equipment like computers:** Generic, but essential, equipment that is used across many different projects are often hard to include in direct costs because they don\u2019t meet the requirement that these direct costs should be for things for to be used for that the proposed project *only*, so the funding agency expects these to be paid for by the university, whose funds come from indirect costs; \n\n- **And many more**, depending on the needs of the individual research proposals.\n\nThe point is, things that are supported by indirect costs are *absolutely critical* activities and services that have to happen for science to be done, but they extend beyond individual research projects. It\u2019s also important to understand what the numbers cited for indirect costs mean. A 50% indirect cost rate does not mean that half of the total grant award goes to indirect costs. In an example provided by MIT in 2017, a 54.7% indirect cost rate resulted in 28 cents of each award dollar going to overhead\u2014 18 cents to facilities costs, 10 cents to administrative costs, 72 cents to direct research costs. The disconnect is because the \"indirect rate\" is only applied to some portions of the budget.\n\nA common argument is that many things that are included in indirect costs could be viewed as direct costs, and while true to a certain extent, that ignores a variety of realities. The first is just that proposal budgets are already exceedingly complicated, and having to calculate things like what portion of the average monthly power bill for your lab space should be covered by a new proposal or *precisely* how many gallons of chemical waste you will generate over the course of a proposed project to be able to convert all the indirect costs to direct costs is a massive effort. Similarly, if you're wrong about any of those things, you actually end up generating a lot more waste than you thought you were going to, right now it doesn't matter because the indirect cost part of the proposal is effectively a fixed percentage tax that doesn't actually track how much you use those resources. If it was part of the direct costs, you'd have to rebudget your remaining funds every time some small detail changed. That is currently rolled into *all the things* covered by indirect costs. Switching all of those to direct costs would make the entire process much less efficient than it already is, and leading to more uncertainty in how much research can be done. \n\nThe indirect cost rates vary between institutions. They are negotiated between institutions and the federal government based on the actual facilities and administrative costs for each institution in previous years, which are influenced by local cost of living as well as the types of facilities available at each institution. Indirect costs include facilities costs and administrative costs. There has been a maximum cap of 26% of F&A that can go toward administrative costs since 1991; even as federal regulations have increased, the share of administrative costs in total indirect costs has remained flat, so the narrative that increases F&A represents administrative bloat is largely overblown. Finally, in most cases, the indirect costs acquired through federal grants are insufficient to actually fully pay for all of the indirect costs incurred by universities as part of doing research. That is to say, federally funded scientific research generally does not fully pay for itself in terms of the resources it requires from the universities where this research is done. Suffice to say, sudden, dramatic, and draconian reductions in F&A rates to [rates well below current negotiated rates](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/), if they come to fruition, will cause massive budget shortfalls at a large number research universities that are *already operating with a loss with respect to research activities*. That will generally mean that staff will be let go, programs will be shut down (i.e., individual majors or entire divisions will cease to exist), and the programs and faculty that remain will have significantly fewer resources to do the work they are trying to do, which is push scientific progress and educate the next generation of STEM professionals. Thus, reducing indirect costs unilaterally like what is proposed will lead to *less science being done, not more*. If you want to read more about what indirect costs are and what  activities on campuses they do (and don\u2019t) support, this [FAQ from the American Association of Universities](https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/frequently-asked-questions-about-facilities-and-administrative-fa-costs-federally) is quite comprehensive.  \n\n---\n\n**What can I do?**\n\nIf you're a US citizen, you can **contact your elected representatives** to tell them that you're worried about the funding of science and the loss of scientists in the federal workforce. [**You can find your elected members of Congress here.**](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member) \n\nIf you're looking for more facts on how this will affect you, it's easy enough to find direct impacts by state or federal science funding. For example, [this page from the NSF](https://new.nsf.gov/about/fact-sheets#nsf-in-your-state-a2f) allows you to quickly see just how much of this money goes back into education and private industry in your given state from NSF funding. Similar resources exist for [NIH funding](https://report.nih.gov/) as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a US citizen, we encourage you to share this text or use it yourself to help answer common questions or correct misconceptions about these issues that you see here on Reddit or elsewhere in the world.",
