Same for Panama and Greenland. That would be the honorable thing to do, but yeah I get it, republican politicians are spineless and constantly play defence for Trump. Congress is meant to be an independent branch of government able to check the president's power but these guys all just do whatever Trump wants. Because Project 2025 essentially calls for a King via \"Unitary Executive Theory\". He could propose a law making it illegal to breath and these cucks would vote 52-48 to pass it.\n\nHilarious to recall republican voters saying, \"I'm voting for Trump because I want no more wars, he's the peace candidate, America first\". Now they are all scrambling to defend an imperialist. He did not end the conflict in Ukraine in 24 hours like he said (lmao). He did not end the conflict in Gaza, he loves sending blank checks of our tax dollars for more death and destruction over there just like Biden, only with more mask-off glee about it. He is starting trade wars with most of our allies, every week another one, and talking about invading many of them when we've historically never even had any major problems with them and peace has benefited us both for trade, tourism, joint security (Canada helped us during 9/11 and in Iraq for example), etc. I know you guys hate doing the right thing and think empathy is weak, but also leaving allies alone is a positive in terms of, ya know, just not being evil.",

It was a part of Columbia.   The U.S. supported & promoted Panamanian independence & have them the canal that the U.S. paid for & created.   It needed to be done & the U.S. did it. \n\nBefore the canal was completed,  ships moving west has to travel down & around the entire south American coast,  costing time,  burning fuel & inviting risk. \n\nThe French began the project around 1880.  It failed.   In 1904, the U.S. took over the project,  enabled Panama to become independent from Columbia,  finished the canal around 1915 & turned it over (conditional contact)  to Panama to operate & develop an economy from. \n\nThe U.S. has no vested interest in the canal profits & U.S. ships pay Panama to use the canal.  For canal fee reference,  it costs around $1k-$2k to take a U.S. registered,  privately owned,  40 foot boat through the canal.\n\nGreenland:   Transparency is important to some. \n\nAfter World War II, the United States secretly offered to buy Greenland; there was public discussion about purchasing the island during Trump's first term in 2019 and again after Trump's 2024 reelection.  Secret offers vs. Public discussions= very different actions. \n\nCanada:   The U.S. has suffered a massive trade deficit with Canada since WWII.  Currently,  that deficit is around $65 BILLION,  annually. \n\nCanada gets all of their \"critical imports\" from the U.S.  These are products that Canada needs,  but can't source domestically.   The U.S. is Canada's biggest trade partner.   Canada is NOT U.S.'s biggest trade partner & the U.S. does not have a \"critical import\" list. \n\nTariffs are imposed on Canada by the U.S. to compel Canada to increase border control investment & effectiveness.  Canada responds by imposing higher tariffs on more U.S. products.   \n\nCanada will have to get those critical needs imports from another country & that will invite profoundly higher costs for transpo.  Not exactly a win for Canada. \n\nSo, what does the U.S. do?   Taunts Canada with the 52nd State tease & ignorant people like this woman cry *foul*...lol",

Regardless of your Newsmax sources,  Sovereign countries aren't keen on being attacked or threatened.   Every partner the US has is re-evaluating their agreements with  you. Nobody wants instability in their partnerships. I'm happy to pay 3x as much for something just to not buy US-made.

Since it's no longer the 1800's , tariffs are considered by virtually everyone to be ineffective as a bargaining tool.  In the last 80 years, global transportation is cheap, reliable and fast.  Our oranges come from Morocco, Avocados from Mexico,  etc.  Cutting trade from the US will hurt for a bit, but finished goods are available everywhere.  Meanwhile, say goodbye to your auto industry (tariffs will kill Ford and  GM), farming (our potash grows your food)  , steel production (we supply most of your required Aluminum and Nickel), etc.  Again - it's not the trade imbalance that's at issue here.  It's your addled president and his cronies threatening our sovereignty over and over and you MAGA idiots crowing for war.",

We'll be fine without Canadian imports. \n\nHope your nuclear reactors & boilers don't need parts any time soon,  though.

You can keep your import cars. You'll need  them to make some Frankenstein delivery van or truck to move your goods around. \n\nCanada gets half of what they need from the U.S.  57 out of 90 product categories.

It'll be satisfying to watch that self-imposed fall. \n\nThe Panama Canal \"ownership\" has always been conditional. \n\nWho knew that the U.S. was \"secretly\" trying to buy Greenland after WWII?  Who knows why Greenland is a geo-political interest to the U.S. & Canada now? \n\nThe 57,000 inhabitants of Greenland have governing independence from the Kingdom of Denmark,  but still rely heavily on Denmark & other countries to meet the needs of their population. \n\nEstablishing a national interest in Greenland benefits Greenland & the country investing in Greenland.   If Russia makes a move on Greenland to gain close proximity/ access to North America,  will Denmark be able to stop Russia? \n\nThe only saber rattling he's doing is the 52nd State taunt.
