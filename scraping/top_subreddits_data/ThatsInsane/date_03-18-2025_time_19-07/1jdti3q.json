I don't know if it was avoidable but having seen the vide, she was standing in a closet with no weapons and just the child. \n\nOC spray would have ended the incident right there but for some reason he allowed her to walk to the bed and sit down. She had a knife, and he reacted. However, I do also wonder if better methods are out using specialized unit departments instead of cops that see everyone as a target. Cops these days don't have that mentality, they get pumped up with \"killology \"programming.",

Americans have a greater chance of dying from food poisoning than of being shot by a cop.  Three out of four American cops never fire a weapon on duty outside of training, though there are the bad apples like Derek Chauvin who was involved in four police shootings, one of them fatal.\n\n> I do also wonder if better methods are out using specialized unit\n\nBetter training and tougher hiring standards would help.  Connecticut does pretty good training, but I might not trust a cop trained in Louisiana to mow my lawn.  There is just the little problem of getting state legislatures to cough up the money for that, good luck.",

Imagine being upset and then ur face and eyes burning. Well\u2026.. remember that knife she was holding? What do you think is gonna happen when she feels attacked ??? That\u2019s right she\u2019s gonna start BLINDLY slicing and dicing and there\u2019s 2 cops there and most importantly a child. So u have to disable her, unfortunately there was little regard for the infant it seems the cop freaked out and didn\u2019t assess the situation more carefully",
