State-organized militias were seen as a counterbalance\u2014both to federal military power and to threats from within.\n\nWhat Was It Not Intended For?\n\nDespite modern interpretations, the Second Amendment was not originally meant to:\n\n\u2022\tGuarantee unrestricted individual gun ownership \u2013 The phrase \u201cwell-regulated militia\u201d indicates that firearm use was expected to be controlled and organized by the states, not left entirely to individuals. This means the SCOTUS majority opinion in D.C. v Heller (2008) making gun ownership an individual right wasn\u2019t constitutionally sound.\n\n\u2022\tJustify armed resistance against laws people disagree with \u2013 The Founders supported legal and political solutions over violent uprisings. Even during Shays\u2019 and the Whiskey Rebellions, they used federal force to suppress armed resistance.\n\n\u2022\tEnable private citizens to stockpile military-grade weaponry \u2013 The arms of the time were muskets and flintlock pistols, not semi-automatic rifles or high-capacity firearms. There was no concept of widespread civilian access to advanced weaponry.\n\n\u2022\tSupport a culture of individual self-defense as a primary focus \u2013 While self-defense was recognized as a right, the amendment was framed around the collective security of a \u201cfree state\u201d through militias, not personal defense against crime.\n\nWhy Is It No Longer Necessary?\n\nToday, every state has its own militia: the National Guard. These forces are:\n\n\u2022\tFederally trained and equipped\n\n\u2022\tManaged at both the state and federal level\n\n\u2022\tCapable of responding to emergencies, invasions, and domestic threats\n\nBecause states have the ability to properly arm and organize their militias, there is no longer a need for individual citizens to provide their own weaponry for this purpose. Expecting National Guard members to arm themselves independently would be both unnecessary and counterproductive.\n\nWhat Does the Second Amendment Do Today?\n\nIn modern America, the misinterpretation of the Second Amendment has largely prevented states from enacting common-sense gun regulations, contributing to:\n\n\t\u2022\tAn epidemic of gun violence, taking thousands of lives each year\n\n\t\u2022\tA loss of freedom for many Americans who live with debilitating gun-related injuries and medical debt\n\n\t\u2022\tEconomic burdens, costing the country trillions in medical expenses, law enforcement resources, and lost productivity\n\nWhile originally intended to ensure state militias could protect the country, the amendment now functions in a way the Founders likely never envisioned\u2014allowing widespread gun access with devastating consequences.",

Militia is all able body men, aka the people, who could be called upon when needed to defend towns and states. Now, security of the free State, at the time the founders were cautious about authoritarian and tyrannical rules. So, for a state (country) to maintain freedom, it should have a well maintained group of men who can be called upon to defend the free State.\r\n\r\n\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\r\n\r\nThe second part then clearly outlines that the people, who all make up the Militia, have the right to bear arms. Notice they did not write rifles. They wrote Arms. At the time, civilians were expected to maintain weaponry so that if called, they could be used as a defensive force. This does not limit the type or make of weaponry. However their has always been a cost factor that prevents any civilian from effectively owning military hardware. Now shall not be infringed clearly means the 2nd amendment should not be limited to what types of weaponry the people can own.\r\n\r\nNow we as a society and agreed upon in the courts decided if a person has a unique quality that leads them to be at greater chance of harm that they do lose their right to arms. Such as people with previous convictions, mental illness, and domestic violence cases.\r\n\r\nSo the 2nd amendment does not limit what type or weaponry it is about the people's right to keep the weaponry they desire.\r\n\r\nQueue common jokes of\r\n\r\n\"my own nuclear weapon\". Okay, good luck getting the resources and logistics to make and maintain such a weapon.\r\n\r\n\"You're rifle is useless against modern military\" Right just as they were with the IRA, Vietnam, Taliban, ISIS, and every other civilian gorilla force. If, and big if the U.S. citizens ever decided to revolt, it would not be traditional warfare. It would be cells of operatives doing a gorilla warfare and likely using terror attacks. I do not ever see the U.S. dropping bombs from planes onto American cities in this scenario unless a true dictator is in power. It's just absurd.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that I do not want nor think a U.S. civil war is going to happen or is a reality. I am just saying IF it were to occur, that's the more realistic viewpoint than something like we are seeing in Ukraine right now.",

                                            "body": "# A proper definition of \"well-regulated,\" especially in historical and scholarly contexts, must meet three key standards:\n\n1. **Historical Context** \u2013 The definition should be grounded in how the term was used in the 18th century, particularly in legal, military, and political writings of the time.\n2. **Linguistic Accuracy** \u2013 The definition should be consistent with how similar terms were used in contemporary writings, avoiding anachronistic reinterpretations.\n3. **Scholarly Consensus** \u2013 It should align with interpretations from historians, constitutional scholars, and legal precedent.\n\nIn the 18th century, \"well-regulated\" meant **properly disciplined, organized, and functioning according to rules or standards**. Examples of its usage include:\n\n* **Federalist No. 29 (Alexander Hamilton, 1788)**: A \"well-regulated militia\" required training and government oversight.\n\nThe 2nd Amendment was written in the context of state-controlled militias, which were regulated by law, had muster requirements, and were often required to register weapons. The idea of an entirely unregulated people's militia is not supported by history. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in *Federalist No. 29*, a well-regulated militia is one that is \u2018properly officered, armed, and equipped, and in the course of discipline\u2019 imposed by the government. He acknowledged that militias must be under state and federal regulation, stating that 'this appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.'\n\nHamilton explicitly rejected the notion that an undisciplined, unregulated mass of armed citizens could serve as an effective militia, warning that \u2018to attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to the service of the state would be as visionary and impracticable as it would be injurious.\u2019 Instead, he emphasized that a well-regulated militia requires order and discipline, not just armed individuals. He further argued that without proper regulation, the militia would be \u2018little more than a mob,\u2019 reinforcing the idea that militias were expected to be subject to governmental oversight and training.\n\nThus, a **historically sound definition** of \"well-regulated\" in the 2nd Amendment would be: \n\n\"A militia that is properly trained, organized, and subject to state or legal oversight, ensuring discipline and readiness.\"\n\n\"So the 2nd amendment does not limit what type or weaponry it is about the people's right to keep the weaponry they desire.\"\n\nThat's not how the U.S. Constitution works. Powers and protections that are not expressly stated to be under the purview of the U.S. federal government is delegated to the states. The Second Amendment doesn't express limits on weaponry of individual citizens because the Second Amendment was written to ensure states could form organized militias, and not for the purpose of establishing an individual right to bear arms. This is further supported by state gun regulations of the time.",

Neglect from those two would've been an upgrade. Neglect from police happens a lot in black communities (I'm from one) and it isn't tyrannical, how police conduct themselves when they finally appear is tyrannical.\n\nThe issue here is that that neglect from police leaves open a niche window for tyranny to propagate from other groups, but that tyranny is owed to the white supremacist groups who *are* actively oppressing that community.",

Because it's not illegal or against the constitution of your land to be a Nazi, is it? Isn't it in fact one of the greatest thing the USAians claim is so good, the freedom to be anything?

Or operation paperclip. The propping up of former Nazi's both in US politics and as puppets in foreign regimes. Sam Lincoln Rockwell. Or the origins of most of Hitler's ideas (spoilers; they came from America). Nazism is a recurring theme in the American legacy.\n\nBut I absolutely agree, fuck Nazis",
