The chinese are rushing to these attractions in the thousands. Only (city4) is completely empty. As the people we asked about said: It looked too boring.\" (Camera shows an empty street that to be fair looked like they were standing in said street in my city)\n\nMy city isn't necessarily unpopular or small, it just has a certain \"vanilla\" rep and to be fair the, didn't pick the most best part to replicate, but still I love that funfact that they bothered with recreating many many european citys and even when you don't have to travel as far they won't visit that specific one :D",
