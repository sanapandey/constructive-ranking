Otherwise the woman that he was holding hostage would have simply shot him herself with the handgun she had in the bathroom she was locked in.\n\n\n>The caller, Lisa Cannon, told Newell that her husband had handguns and an AR-15 carbine, records show.\n\n>Newell began to worry. She notified Roder that the suspect was an off-duty cop, and he alerted responding officers through the computers in their patrol cars. But they already knew where they were going and asked for additional help.\n\n>The officers carefully listened as Roder spoke. They sounded different, he recalled, their transmissions were to-the-point, sharp and crisp.\n\n>At 8:42 p.m. -- eight minutes into the call -- officers arrived at the home and entered through the garage. It was dark inside the house; the suspect had turned off all the lights.\n\n>A minute later they radioed Roder that they were challenging the suspect whom they identified as Cannon.\n\n>Cannon initially told the cops to shoot him, records show, but soon after he threatened to gun them down. He ordered the officers out of his house, saying he would kill them if they refused to leave. He yelled at the officers, referring to them by name.\n\n>Roder took notes as Newell collected information from the caller about the layout of the house.\n\n>Twenty minutes after the officers went in, the gunfight began. Officers engaged in the first of three rounds of gunfire with Cannon, records show. The off-duty cop kept out of sight from officers, continuously changing his upstairs position in a stairwell and blocking the path to his wife and daughter, police have said.\n\n>Cannon, authorities and records say, shot his AR-15 through walls at law enforcement. Police returned fire with handguns and rifles.\n\nLooks like the other officers are the ones who shot first, too. Though those shots probably would have come within ten seconds of him threatening to kill them while holding a gun had it been someone else, assuming he was in their line of sight.",

American cops kill from a thousand to twelve hundred people a year, many of them in unquestioned justified shootings (e.g., someone opens fire on them first).  The U.S. isn't even in the top five nations for killings by police.  There are bad cops like Derek Chauvin who was involved in four police shootings, one of them fatal.  But three quarters of American cops never fire a weapon on duty outside of training.  Public perception isn't always backed up by numbers.",

In a democracy where every vote carries equal weight, populist rhetoric and misinformation often gain traction among those who lack the critical thinking skills or education necessary to assess complex issues. This has led to policies driven by emotion, conspiracy, and short-term gratification rather than logic, evidence, and long-term prosperity. While innovation and progress still emerge from the nation\u2019s intellectual and technological elite, they are increasingly hamstrung by political and social movements that reject expertise in favor of simplistic, populist solutions. The question remains whether the U.S. can overcome this trend\u2014whether it can find a way to uplift its population through better education and media literacy, or whether it will continue on a path where irrational voices wield disproportionate power, undermining the very foundation of progress.\"",
