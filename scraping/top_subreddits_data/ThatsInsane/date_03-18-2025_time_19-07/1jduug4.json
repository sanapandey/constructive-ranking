                    "body": ">**What's with wanting everyone to be grateful to the US?**\n\nI have a pet theory that it's parcel of how, at least for a few cycles of school kids (possibly not 'several generations', but a big run of them), we taught history according to what I call the \"God dammit, what is it NOW?!\" school of International Relations.\n\nLike (the way ended up sinking in):\n\n>...the US post-Revolution was content minding its own business (things like the XYZ Affair notwithstanding) until (god dammit what now?) the British started abducting American sailors off their own ships, leading to the War of 1812. It was a draw. The US then dealt with its own Civil War but otherwise kept to itself (while, say, the Victorian-era British tried to have it both ways by declaring neutrality but helping the Confederate Navy).\n\n>Then we mostly kept to ourselves until (Goddam it, what now?) we got pulled into ww1, after which we tried giving Germany less punitive terms which got us laughed out of the room. We helped set up the League of Nations to try to help prevent it happening again but otherwise  went isolationist for our troubles until Europe and Japan inevitably got us (goddamn it, what now?) hauled into WW2.\n\n>After which we set up the Marshall Plan, NATO and things like the Bretton Woods accord to help prevent that happening again until (goddamn it, what is it now?) we got hauled into France's fuck-up in Viet Nam...\n\nAnd so on. It's an artifact of wanting to teach a 'march to progress' version of US history (where we keep improving) along with units connecting US history to World History mainly through explaining why the US participated in crises and other wars abroad.\n\nSo the impression it leaves is that some party abroad keeps screwing up, starts a big war, \"draws the US into it\", then takes advantage of the US in the aftermath. (Also, side things like \"the US finished the Panama Canal when everyone else screwed it up.\") It also glides by things that the US was only involved in short-term that worked out well, so it makes it seem like we kept getting the crap jobs. That gets into people's intellectual groundwater.\n\nSo far as I know it's not something anyone ran on (even on as local as school-board level), it's just something that a lot of Americans moved on half-remembering: anything involving international affairs is basically trying to take advantage of the US, who are (on a civilian level in any case) 'trying to mind their own business'.\n\nFor a long time, that wasn't actually part of US politics. (Mostly because even the candidates' \"bright young consultants\" went to school before the 70s or 80s)  Then someone decided to try to run on \"*.... and we're tired of it*.\"\n\nTrump wasn't the first, he was just the loudest. (Bush 2 used to ask State Department people 'what side are you on?' when they briefed him on some regional conflict, and then (when they answered in terms of who they thought had the stronger case to be in the right), insist that the right answer for a US official was \"America's side\" and work toward that rather than, say, making bench judgements about which Balkan state was morally purest.)\n\nAnd it didn't come from a pacifist or even all that non-interventionist a position, but from a position of not wanting to get drawn into that cycle again. (You hear it a lot in terms of 'US go home- no, not like that! Not yet! No wait, you're doing it wrong. US go home! No, wait- not like that!\" memes.)\n\n*Then* it got extended to things like trade agreements (where \"all the jobs went to other countries\") foreign aid (which most people think of as a bigger share of the budget than it actually is, and which \"we never got a thank-you for\"), nonstop military engagement (which people were thinking of in terms of \"my neighbor's kid is getting deployed to *where* the fuck?\" rather than anything geopolitical- which likewise gets turned into resentment toward people who do think geopolitically, 'cause *they* tend not to have anyone personally out there doing this stuff), NATO not meeting their own obligations (which Obama was even pointing out at one point, so it's not just a GOPnik thing), recurring \"peacekeeping\" in places that can't seem to come up with not shooting at each other and so on.\n\nSo, anyway, that explains why 'they're not grateful' *keeps working,* rhetorically speaking. And they keep doing it because it keeps working.",

Sure France is the reason we exist but because they created us(and we didn\u2019t do anything crazy like split into two different countries) we were in a position to offer significant material aid to liberating France down the line. It\u2019s not why we did it of course but France had their own selfish reasons for helping us out way back when.\n\nIt\u2019s also a bit absurd to suggest we give the Statue of Liberty back to anybody. It\u2019s ours and it symbolizes a very important aspect of America. Despite the irony inherent in us owning it. It\u2019s an ideal to live up to, one we have never fully embraced and may never fully embraced but to reject the Statue of Liberty would mean we are giving up on that ideal.\n\nSo the whole thing is absurd. Might as well look at the interesting points with your numbers. For example, isn\u2019t it funny how small we were back then and then how big we got in comparison to France only 150ish years later?

The Red Army got their fucking asses kicked in every battle and only won due to sheer numbers, and that was with the US producing nearly ALL of their semis and locomotives, and while contributing food, ammunition and planes. It could be argued that the United States supplied the entire allied coalition on their own. \n\nHow exactly was the war won by the allies before their showed up? Because if memory serves me right, in 1941, Hitler had all of Europe and Japan did whatever they wanted in the Pacific. \n\nOh wait, you must have thought the British would provide all these materials, troops, and would have launched a valiant counter strike to push Hitler back to Berlin! Yeah, except, that would have NEVER happened without the US. The British bomber fleet didn't have nearly the numbers the US did, nor did they have the required amount of troops to invade mainland Europe. I just don't understand how you think the allies would have won it when the US was supplying them with all their needs, all the whole contributing millions of troops and personnel, AND they strategically bombed the shit out of German and Japan, culminating with the atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But yeah I'm sure the Russians or British could have done it all. Oh wait...don't forget the Canadians!\n\nRead up on your history bro, you don't know shit.\n\n\n\nU.S. supplied ~2/3 of Allied military equipment post-1941.\n\nAircraft: 295,959 (48.6% of 609,207 total Allied).\n\nTanks & SPGs: 108,410 (40.1% of 270,041).\n\nLarge ships: 2,020 (76% of 2,658).\n\nArtillery: 257,390.\n\nVehicles: 2,382,311 (58.7% of 4,054,932).\n\nLend-Lease aid: $50 billion total.\n\nSoviet Union Lend-Lease: $11.3 billion.\n\nSoviet aircraft from U.S.: 18,200 (~30% of their fighters/bombers).\n\nSoviet trucks from U.S.: 33% of total.\n\nSoviet railroad equipment from U.S.: 92.7% (1,911 locomotives, 11,225 railcars).\n\nSoviet aviation fuel from U.S.: 57%.",

The Soviets took on the bulk of the German army, and by the time the U.S. even joined, Germany had already stalled outside Moscow. Stalingrad and Kursk were massive defeats for the Nazis, and the Red Army was outproducing Germany in tanks and artillery by 1943. They suffered over 75% of German casualties, which tells you who was really breaking the Nazi war machine.\n\nGermany was also fighting too many battles at once. Hitler made terrible strategic decisions, stretching his forces too thin. The British were already bombing German industry and controlling the Atlantic with their navy. Even before the U.S. entered, Britain had held off a German invasion and was fighting in North Africa, winning at El Alamein without American troops.\n\nThe Pacific War didn\u2019t change much for the European front. The U.S. focused on Japan early on, so they didn\u2019t put their full weight into Europe until mid-1944. Meanwhile, the Soviets were smashing through German lines and preparing to invade Japan themselves. Their invasion of Manchuria in 1945 probably pushed Japan toward surrender just as much as the atomic bombs.\n\nYeah, Lend-Lease helped, but it wasn\u2019t a game-changer. The Soviets were already mass-producing their own weapons, including the T-34, which was one of the best tanks of the war. Most of their artillery and tanks were Soviet-made, and only about 30% of their trucks came from the U.S. They were already self-sufficient by 1943.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget, by the time D-Day happened, Germany was already losing. The Soviets launched Operation Bagration in mid-1944 and completely destroyed Germany\u2019s Army Group Center, which was a way bigger deal than the Normandy landings. By the time the U.S. got to Berlin, the Soviets had already won the race.\n\nSo yeah, the U.S. sped things up and reduced Allied casualties, but Germany was already doomed by 1943. Hitler\u2019s bad decisions, economic weaknesses, and the Soviet war machine meant the Nazis were never going to hold on forever. The war would have been longer and bloodier, but the outcome wouldn\u2019t have changed.",

Talk about proving the other person\u2019s point!\n\nOur industries were gutted due to the amount of enrolled men fighting, and so we had to buy food and other essentials from USA. For almost 2 years you not only stayed out the war but you profiteered off us.\n\nJust while we\u2019re on that topic, when your soldiers were finally stationed here, they saw the conditions of a country that had been at war. Basic foods such as bread, butter, and sugar were rationed, and many people couldn\u2019t afford basic dentistry. Today Americans still repeat the \u201cbad food\u201d and \u201cbad teeth\u201d tropes.

For example, had USSR joined WWII last instead of you then they might be the ones claiming that today.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s even harder to say you \u201cended things\u201d when the war lasted almost another **4 years** after you joined. Hence it was far from the solo effort you\u2019re presenting it to be.\n\nIf anything, the fact you Americans think you had the power to \u201cend\u201d it makes your late participation even worse. Your Plan A was you stand by and hope the other allies would defeat the Axis without you. In 1941, Plan A was looking less and less probable, so you switched to Plan B, join the war and pretend to be the heroes.\n\nThe reality is this: Had you joined WWII at the start then the war wouldn\u2019t have lasted 6 years and perhaps the atrocities such as Auschwitz and Birkenau might never have happened. That\u2019s USA\u2019s real legacy.",

Marshall Zhukov said without those hundreds of thousands of Studebaker trucks, Soviet artillery would have been immobile.  The Soviets built plenty of their own tanks and guns and planes, but without those trucks, and railway locomotives, and huge quantities of food and millions of pairs of boots and radio tubes and all the other aide the Soviets, got, they'd have been in deep trouble.  The Soviets did most of the dying on the Allied side, but there was no way they could have fed their troops or kept them supplied in the field without U.S. aid.",

American troops arrived in the UK January, 1942, by which time General Winter had already landed its first body blow on the Wehrmacht.  The Battle of Stalingrad, which broke the German advance, began on 17 July 1942 and was fought viciously until 2 February 1943, when the remnants of the German Sixth Army surrendered.  From that moment on, the Soviet Army advanced: by D-Day, 6 June 1944, it had pushed the Germans to the western border of the USSR and was ready to enter eastern Europe.  The Allies advanced the date of D-Day because they were afraid that Russia would defeat Germany before they could get there.\n\nThe US, through its propaganda and Hollywood's films, has convinced itself that *it* won the war singlehanded (with a little help from Churchill; and the RAF).  In fact, it won the peace, not the war, because it insisted on collecting every last penny of principle *and* interest on all war loans and leases, which made it a very rich nation.\n\nThe last payment made on US war loans was in 2006.",
