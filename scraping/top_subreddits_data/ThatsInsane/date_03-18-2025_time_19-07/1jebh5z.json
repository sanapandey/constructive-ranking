We didn\u2019t start this fight, we\u2019re responding with equal force, since we can\u2019t change laws we have fire.

They never will against people who will never listen and don\u2019t have empathy. \n\nAgain, we the people did not fucking fire the first shot. The Americans with green cards getting deported, cutting important funding across the board, planning to target social security. VA cuts. This wasn\u2019t what we wanted, and most of it is against the law. Ignoring a direct court order and seeing he will not get marshaled puts it in our hands, Tesla stock is based on the fantasy of future scientific breakthroughs and profiting off of them.

We didn\u2019t start this. We didn\u2019t want to turn to violence, the courts refusing to arrest makes us do this. It\u2019s the public\u2019s only leverage against the administration, peaceful protests do nothing and get dispersed. Deporting people for exercising their first amendment rights is unconstitutional.

Maybe you are correct and it is simply being reported more; but itsure feels like the incidence of parked, not running I.C.E. vehicles catching fire in non-arson circumstances might be lower than the same stat for teslas (and all E.V.s?).\n\nSimply said: Parked, \"off\" Teslas have been observed to catch fire.
