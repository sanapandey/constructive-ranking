Phase 2 involved release of all the hostages and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The far-right coalition parties did not want troop removal despite the deal so threatened to collapse the government. As a result the Israelis insisted on extending Phase 1, even though that was not part of the deal. Hamas rejected an extension and said to stick to the deal. Israel used this as an excuse to unilaterally break the ceasefire and continue hostilities.",

You complete Phase 1 and then Phase 2 begins. Negotiations have already happened.\n\n Israel wanted to extend Phase 1. So in fact Israel were the ones with ridiculous demands.\nPhase 2 includes troop withdrawal which the far-right doesn't want and has treated to disband the coalition government over. Hence Israel requested Phase 1 extension to stall. When Hamas said there's no reason for an extension and refuses Israel cut off all aid into Gaza and has now broken the ceasefire.\n\nThe proposals they refused were all to do with Phase 1 extension which was nowhere in the negotiations or deal. You can't change a deal half way through because you decided to want to and then blame the other side for not accepting. Stick to your original deal.\n\nTypical Israeli playbook though. Sabotage a deal and then blame the other side.",

They don't want peace.  It's a Islamic death cult hellbent on the destruction of Israel - mostly through propaganda and getting Israel to kill civilians (they use as shields) \n\nPhase 2 was never a guaranteed next step\u2014it was contingent on further negotiations and Hamas fulfilling its obligations. The claim that Israel \u201cinsisted on extending Phase 1\u201d ignores the fact that Hamas was still holding hostages and had not provided any assurance that Phase 2 would actually proceed. Expecting Israel to withdraw its troops while hostages were still in captivity and Hamas remained armed and operational is not a reasonable condition\u2014it\u2019s a strategic surrender.",

Isreal  wanted a reason for a full-scale invasion, and they got it in the form of October 7th and now tens of thousands of their own people are dead. Both factions are committing war crimes in one of the most televised wars in human history. \n\nThe fact that the US has developed a stance that supports any side committing these crimes is sickening to say the least. Many of us have parents and grandparents that fought and/or died for the end of atrocities like these and I think it's a slap in their face to say that the country they fought for is now endorsing some of the same crimes today.
