It feels odd that people have never visited another country in their entire life. \n\nHere we commonly do something called \"long weekend\", doing a short trip to nearby places with only taking 1-2 days off.\n\nMy wife and I just returned from one, Friday morning we drove to the Netherlands and stayed in Amsterdam till Sunday morning. From there we drove to Bruges in Belgium and returned back home to Cologne Monday evening.\n\nWe did this also End of December, but back then we went to Chamomix, Mont Blanc in the French Alps. \n\nBasically we do such trips 3-4 times a year additionally to a 1-2 weeks trip further away. I can't imagine how my life would look like without traveling, it's one of the most important and fun things to do. I strongly recommend to try it!",
