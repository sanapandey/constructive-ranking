We read at all the posts in the thread and we\u2019re focusing our efforts on issues based on upvotes to ensure that we\u2019re aligned with all of you.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reports so far! You've reported a number of bugs, and we've noticed that many of you are experiencing issues with audio reliability. In response, we've developed our own audio device subsystem for Windows. You can find more details below.\n\nAs always, don't forget to check out our [monthly patch notes](https://discord.com/tags/patch-notes) for updates on all the changes we're working on, our last patch notes have have more 100+ issues\n\n* [December 2024 Patch Notes](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-december-5-2024)\n* [February 2025 Patch Notes](https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-february-3-2025)\n\n**Bugs Fixed**\n\n1.

If you are still having audio issues please make sure your setting in: \"Settings \u2192 Voice & Video \u2192 Audio Subsystem\" is set to \"Automatic\". If it's already on Automatic, then post here with the standard information plus the names of the affected devices.\n\n**Now, with that, let\u2019s kick off the February + March 2025 bug megathread!**\n\n**Please note:**\u00a0This megathread is not a venue for feedback or customer support! We encourage you all to continue to make posts on the subreddit proper discussing our product and feature launches. I want to make sure that we really keep this thread productive and focused on reporting bugs and helping us prioritize them.\n\nPlease look through the list of comments and upvote bug reports which you think we should prioritize fixing. Comment as a reply to those top level comments with any more details that can assist our team in prioritizing and fixing the bug. For example, if you have additional info or steps to reproduce, please post a reply, this will help us fix these bugs even faster. If there is no post that discusses the bug you\u2019re encountering, then start a new post in the thread to report the bug to us!\n\n**Reporting a Bug**\n\n1. The most valuable thing you can provide in a bug report is steps. If you\u2019re able to provide steps to reproduce a high priority issue, it will dramatically improve turnaround time on a fix.\n2. Screenshots or videos are also useful, especially if you can\u2019t reliably reproduce it. We highly recommend editing them to not doxx yourself. Not only does it help contextualize the issue, but watching it occur can sometimes provide information that helps us identify and fix it.\n\n**Example Bug Report**\n\n* **Feature**: Keybinds.\n* **Reproduction Rate**: 1 to 10 - This is a score of how easy/consistently the bug reproduces, from 1 meaning \u201cvery hard to reproduce\u201d to 10 meaning \u201ci can consistently make this happen\u201d\n* **Annoyance**: 1 to 10 - How annoying is this bug to your daily usage of Discord, from 1 meaning, \u201cnot that annoying\u201d to 10 meaning \u201cthis bug really truly sucks please fix this as soon as possible.\u201d\n* **Device/System Info**: Pixel 7, Android 13\n* **Discord Version Info**: Stable 263796 (739ec78) Host 1.0.9032 x86 (43225) Windows 10 64-Bit (10.0.19045)\n* **Description**: Toggle Mute keybinds are no longer functioning.\n* **Steps to reproduce**:\n\n1.

Nothing works.\n\nThe only two things that works has been running in windows 8 compatibility (installs a super old version - app-1.0.9034 ), and the web browser.  \nI'm on version app-1.0.9184 (from AppData\\\\Local\\\\Discord). I'm happy to give more details if it can help.\n\nRecently I've done two things, install AdGuard home for my dns server at home (but changing dns, or setting VPN is not changing anything, so this seems unrelated) and some big update on windows (I was already on win 11 i believe. But this update changed my bakcground to the bamboo forest background)\n\nWanted to add info on the version that works in compatibility mode:  \nstable 372327 (b40a88c) Host 1.0.9034 x64 (44978) Build Override: N/A Windows 8 64-bit (6.2.9200)",

No voice channels, just categories and text channels. When you open the app from background and it refreshes, 1 of 2 things will almost always happen, if the app was on said server that has the issue, when I open it again the app will instantly move me to a different server, then when I click to go back to it, it's empty. Or if I was on a different server and I click back to said server, I get the empty message. Force closing then reopening the app fixes it, but having to do this every single time is extremely annoying especially since it happens pretty often.\n\n- **Video / Screenshot**: https://imgur.com/qFgF3To empty message, there should be a list of a bunch of text channels here.\n\n- **Steps to Reproduce**:\n   1. Open the app, then just leave it in the background long enough until your phone's RAM can no longer hold it.\n   2. Go back to the app, forcing an app refresh which triggers the issue.\n   3. In my description I mention other characteristics of the server but I don't know which or how many of those could be the reason why I get this issue\n\n- **Expected Result**: Server should appear as usual with all the channels, text, etc\n\n- **Actual Result**: Server image shows on my servers list, but when you go to it, it is completely empty as shown in the above screenshot",

It arbitrarily crops it, so others viewing the stream on any device only see about 60% of the screen. This issue does not occur on other platforms with screen-sharing capabilities such as Instagram, Snapchat, Telegram, or Google Meet.\n\nIt is able to share the cover screen (outer, smaller display) correctly, but the inner, large 7.6\" display is affected by this cropping issue. I have attached an image showing exactly what is happening. I have already reported this bug multiple times, and I am not the only person who has encountered or reported this issue.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Open Discord on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6.\n\n2. Ensure the inner 7.6\" display is in use.\n\n3. Join a voice channel or call.\n\n4. Start screen sharing.\n\n5. Have another user view the stream from any device.\n\nExpected Result: The entire inner display is shared properly, as it is on other apps.\n\nActual Result: The shared screen is cropped, displaying only about 60% of the actual content, making it unusable for full-screen sharing.\n\nI have been begging in support for months for this to be fixed. Please stop ignoring me \ud83d\ude4f The sad part is, if Discord was open source I feel like I could easily fix the issue myself. It seems that the screenshare handler is being fixed to sharing at specific aspect ratios so it cannot share the inner displays of Foldable phones correctly. Instead it should actually query the phones screen dimensions and share the entire thing, I dont understand how an issue like this even exists in the first place. Every other app I mentioned with no screensharing issues never had issues from the start on these devices.\n\n[Screenshot of the issue, 100% reproducible ](https://i.imgur.com/ms7EygB.jpeg)",

Try to embed an external image (e.g. https://i.imgur.com/iY5zdY9.png)\n   2. Check the discordapp.net embed url with a resized version. It has these instructions: width=252&height=**300**\n   3. Check the resulting image. At 100% zoom, it has a width of 252 px and a height of **299px**. The embed displays blurrier than intended because the CSS expects an image having a resolution of 252x300.\n   4. Symptons change depending on original image size and DPI/zoom levels. Sometimes, images won't have this issue even if they have the same resolution.\n- Expected Result: Successful embed with a resized image that match the parameters in the URL.\n- Actual Result: Blurry embed missing an entire line of pixels (vertical or horizontal).",

This helps as most my friends are on video call and the grid format is actually great to look at. I recently reset my Windows Laptop and am using the same settings as I always did (graphic acceleration off in both browser and discord) but it is not working and only showing a black screen. I have tried to run as administrator, try windows 8 compatibility mode, but nothing is working out. I have been streaming for 4-5 years and watching it on discord from multiple devices and it was never an issue. I don't know why is there suddenly a black screen no matter what.\n\n* **Video / Screenshot**:\u00a0Black screen\n* **Steps to Reproduce**:\n   1. Join a call and stream a tab (preferably a browser tab)\n   2. Start playing a video\n   3. Alt+tab back to the discord call and you should see a black screen instead of the actual video playing\n* **Expected Result**: You should be able to view the media you are streaming while you are on discord and on call page\n* **Actual Result**: A black screen appears on the discord grid while trying to view stream on discord itself",

However, as I tried to figure out how to fix the problem, I found that Discord does not share game sound even if I use another PC (laptop, Win10, has nothing to do with the capture card). I could share my screen and audio with an iPhone, so I guess there is an issue with the windows version of Discord?

What a waste of time due to imho a buggy spam filter.\n\n\n\n**Steps to reproduce:** unsure\n\n**Expected result:** join my friend's server and add my friend without it being flagged spam\n\n**Actual result:** flagged as spam; asked to reverify account again and again.",

I just tried Google Chrome and was able to complete the phone verification and login again.  Unfortunately, every time I try to remove my phone number, it brings me back to the verification screen.",

Open Discord\n2. Screen Share (The game I was testing was Monster Hunter Wilds, where this was repeatable) with Dualshock 5 controller plugged in\n3. Upon rumble/vibration, stream audio became glitchy. When no vibration occurs, audio was fine. Audio only glitches when vibration occurs. \n\n* **Expected Result**: Screen Share sound is normal\n* **Actual Result**: Screen Share sound is bugged.\n\nI have made a post on the subreddit regarding this with a clip ([found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1j3njj2/sharing_screen_on_discord_produces_this_sound_bug/)). This does not occur on all games, only certain games; namely Monster Hunter Wilds and Infinity Nikki. Other games have the expected result of normal screen share audio. The only additional software I have for sound on my PC is SteelSeriesGG which is required for my headphones. I've attempted multiple fixes for other known screen share issues but none have resolved the issue at hand, only made it *slightly* better.\n\nUpdate from my post; The issue was caused by a dualshock 5 PS5 controller being used, with vibration on in game. For some reason, the controller's vibration had been picked up during the screen share despite discord not having it selected as an input or output device. Turning off vibration in game and unplugging the controller mid-screen share both resolved the issue.",

I was not able to direct message people who I shared servers with.\n\nIt did not matter if I shared additional servers (in addition to the one I was banned from) or if I did **not** share the banned server with the person but shared other servers, we would be receive a clyde-bot error that we could not message each other until a friend request was sent and accepted.\n- **Video / Screenshot**: https://imgur.com/a/XJrVnc8\n\nThese screenshots will show examples of the block.

The first step is... be banned from a server.\n- 2. Attempt to message people who are **not** on your friends list, but you **share** servers with.\n- 2a. Verify these people have **not blocked** you.\n- 3.

Really, really disappointing.\n\nI have now surrendered and made a new account and despite verifying that account and buying nitro on it it shows 'likely spammer' when I send messages.
