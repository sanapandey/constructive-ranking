    "selftext": "Yep\u2026 DM wallpapers. When you set a wallpaper it will apply for everyone when viewing the DM (this is also available in GDMs). \n\nIt looks like the background options will be preselected ones you choose from, right now it does not look like you can upsold custom ones. The names of the wallpapers are as follows: After Hours, Aura, Blue Petals, Circuit, Cozy Corner, Curious Wumpus, Dark Cabin, Dewdrop Nap, Discord Doodles, Fuji, Honk!, In the woods, Kawaii Cafe, Light Bend, Lofi Skyline, Magnetic Swirl, Mecha v. Kaiju, Mushroom Cottage, Northern Lights, Peaceful Meadow, Purple Prism, Retro Desktop, Seaside Twilight, Sunset, Sunset Camp, Sweet Treat, Treehouse, Urban Eclipse, and Zen Garden. \n\nRight now it does look like it will require nitro to set/edit the DM wallpaper, and it does not appear like there is a client side toggle to disable them. \n\nPersonally I will probably never use this since I prefer just a solid color, and it\u2019s unfortunate that there does not appear to be a local disable option. This sounds like a horrible feature for people with a11y needs if there is no way for them to change it on their side. ",
