    "selftext": "For context, I'm on Windows 10, with an Elgato Wave Link setup. I, along with a few other streamers I talk to, are having issues where the microphone audio is too quiet. People are having to turn us up to 200% just to barely hear us. In any other application it works fine. I looked into the issue, explored many reddit threads, and have done mostly all the things. I turned off all audio processing on Discord via the settings, I attempted to turn off audio enhancements in Windows(the tab is forcibly turned off, and I have tried many ways to get it back), and have attempted every little bit of trickery with regedit I could get working for this problem.\n\n\\##############\n\n**TLDR: I found a workaround, and it works, but it doesn't solve the issue. I turned on windows compatibility mode for the discord shortcut. You right click on the discord shortcut->properties->Compatibility (Tab)->Check \"Run this program in compatibility mode for:\"->Windows 8. Then, check to ensure your microphone levels are good in Windows! This made my microphone audio much better and louder. DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL YOU ARE SURE YOU TRIED ALL OTHER SOLUTIONS! Your solution may be simpler!**\n\n**##############**\n\nAnd now, for the beautiful blob of logs on what may be the issue:\n\n\\[2025-03-18 14:32:39.904\\] \\[11768\\] (audio\\_processing\\_impl.cc:911): AudioProcessing::ApplyConfig: AudioProcessing::Config{ pipeline: { maximum\\_internal\\_processing\\_rate: 48000, multi\\_channel\\_render: 0, multi\\_channel\\_capture: 0 }, pre\\_amplifier: { enabled: 0, fixed\\_gain\\_factor: 1 },capture\\_level\\_adjustment: { enabled: 0, pre\\_gain\\_factor: 1, post\\_gain\\_factor: 1, analog\\_mic\\_gain\\_emulation: { enabled: 0, initial\\_level: 255 }}, high\\_pass\\_filter: { enabled: 1 }, echo\\_canceller: { enabled: 1, mobile\\_mode: 0, enforce\\_high\\_pass\\_filtering: 1 }, noise\\_suppression: { enabled: 0, level: Moderate }, transient\\_suppression: { enabled: 0 }, gain\\_controller1: { enabled: 0, mode: AdaptiveAnalog, target\\_level\\_dbfs: 3, compression\\_gain\\_db: 9, enable\\_limiter: 1, analog\\_gain\\_controller { enabled: 1, startup\\_min\\_volume: 0, clipped\\_level\\_min: 70, enable\\_digital\\_adaptive: 1, clipped\\_level\\_step: 15, clipped\\_ratio\\_threshold: 0.1, clipped\\_wait\\_frames: 300, clipping\\_predictor:  { enabled: 0, mode: 0, window\\_length: 5, reference\\_window\\_length: 5, reference\\_window\\_delay: 5, clipping\\_threshold: -1, crest\\_factor\\_margin: 3, use\\_predicted\\_step: 1 }}}, gain\\_controller2: { enabled: 0, fixed\\_digital: { gain\\_db: 0 }, adaptive\\_digital: { enabled: 0, headroom\\_db: 6, max\\_gain\\_db: 30, initial\\_gain\\_db: 8, max\\_gain\\_change\\_db\\_per\\_second: 3, max\\_output\\_noise\\_level\\_dbfs: -50 }, input\\_volume\\_control : { enabled 0}}\n\n  \nI know this is a huge blob, so I'll cover the details. I currently have the echo cancellation turned off in the GUI, however:\n\n\"echo\\_canceller\": { **\"enabled\": 1**, \"mobile\\_mode\": 0, \"enforce\\_high\\_pass\\_filtering\": 1 }\n\nIt's still turned on for the WebRTC parameters! Along with compression/limiter settings turned on that one cannot adjust on their own, at least I think, haven't dug that deep. I did notice when I looked at my microphone settings for WaveLink:Stream that it was turned down from 100 to 57.  So, I'm not sure if this is some kind of cloud error of passing settings around. But something to look into!\n\n  \nI have ran multiple resets on the voice profiles in both the web version and standalone. I have attempted to turn on/off just about every slider known to man. Deleted everything, forgotten cookies, reinstalled it all, but to no avail. So, with the workaround being using Windows 8 compatibility mode, I hope there can be a better solution in the future!\n\n",
