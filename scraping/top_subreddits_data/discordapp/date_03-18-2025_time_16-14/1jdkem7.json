I can\u2019t see any other reason to remove it aside from the licensing deal that Discord has with the studio not being renewed and them being forced to remove it for legal reasons. \n\nDead By Daylight did the same with at least one of their playable killers - Demogorgon was a DLC, but when the license wore out, it was removed from the store. In their case, you were able to keep using it if you purchased it, but that\u2019s likely due to something in the original contract signed that guaranteed that. I doubt discord cares too much about mokoko cosmetic or would have bothered to negotiate that lol",
