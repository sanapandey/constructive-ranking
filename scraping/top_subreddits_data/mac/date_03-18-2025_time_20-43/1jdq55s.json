Literally the second I realized what it was I pre-ordered it despite not even having a 20\u201d G4. The M4 Mac Mini is actually just hidden under the desk. I know it\u2019s possible to do 3d printed brackets and mount the logic board, and I might do that some day, but for now it\u2019s just external. The screen is amazing, I don\u2019t ever notice that it\u2019s not FHD. It\u2019s my computer that I Work-From-Home on so that just goes to show how comfortable it is to use.",

I watched some reviews (specifically the one by DefinitiveMacUpgrade) and they said that it is a below average mouse. I honestly love it! I was worried it was gonna be a waste of money and I was going to switch out to something more practical but I think it\u2019s great! I even get a lot of use out of sideways scrolling which is a feature I never knew I needed.\n\nEdit: also yeah, the screen is amazing. Literally the only thing I would change would be brightness (just slightly dimmer than a modern display). The lower resolution is completely negligible to me and the size is great. JuicyCrumb does make a version for the 17\u201d G4 and (being an owner of a 17\u201d) that might be a little too much of a sacrifice for me. So I\u2019m glad I went with the 20\u201d despite the dramatic cost increase.",
