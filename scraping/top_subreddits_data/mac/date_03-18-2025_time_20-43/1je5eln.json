I want it to tell me, \"hey, tax extension filings are due in five days, I have prepared this form for you if you want me to send it to the IRS.\" Hell, I'd like my phone to be able to answer how far I am from the border of states while I'm driving. I know Apple Intelligence isn't in CarPlay yet, but it's ridiculous that I'm driving to California and ask \"Hey Siri, how far am I from the border of California\" and Siri says, \"California, Maryland is WXYZ miles away.\"",
