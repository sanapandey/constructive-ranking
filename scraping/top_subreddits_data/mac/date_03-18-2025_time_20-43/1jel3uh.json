    "selftext": "It's time to replace my early 2015 intel 13\" MacBook Pro.  It lags and freezes so much that it has become un-usable. Even lagging as I type this, so excuse typos.\n\nFrom scanning through this sub (while it works) it seems that the consensus for me is to get an Air with 16gb RAM. I will be using it for work (run a construction business), browsing, emails, etc. Future business venture may lead me down a road of starting a youtube channel, but that would be the most taxing thing I do with this next MacBook. I do travel with the computer in my work van daily. It sometimes is opened on a jobsite and it will be my only computer, so durability is a factor. There will always be music, youtube, or podcast playing in the background while I do invoicing, send emails, and browse online. \n\nMy question is, if I get an 16gb/512 Air could I reasonably get another 7-10 years out of it? I admittedly don't know much about the differences in MBP and Air, but I feel that the MBP will be built with better \"components\" than the Air. At least that's how it was framed to me 10 years ago when I got this computer. Also is the 16g/512 combo going to be as slow as my 8gb is now after years of OS updates and new software. \n\nPrice difference between the Air and MBP is a small factor to me but if I could get 8 years+ out of the computer than I would be happy to spend extra. When we buy tools for the company, we buy the best brand/model that we can. They usually outlast and outperform the lesser brand/model that is \"good enough\".\n\nTIA",

Moreover, the Airs don't have a fan inside, so they won't clog up with dust from job site use. \n\nAnd yes, get the 16GB or even the 24GB RAM version, and spend that Pro money on the storage for the Air.",

Working out of your truck (van in your case) is rough.  If you are going mobile only, I am not certain that the air would be rugged enough to last that long.  It might.

The specs you listed would get you 3-5 years, but software grows and becomes more demanding every year. RAM is a major factor in making your system responsive. And you're correct, while an Air isn't exactly a toy, the MBP is sturdier. \n\nCheck out Apple's refurb site and you can save a lot of money on an M2 or even an M3. For what you're talking about you don't need an M4, and your CPU could easily take you the full 8 years you're asking about. Good luck!",

The air in particular runs on mojave + windows 10 ltsc, in both cases quite a snappy experience. In fact its better than M2's sonoma/sequioa laggy widgets. Battery life (daily usage) is about 6-7 hours on 2015 air, and 12-14 hours on thinkpad. Dont miss the m2 at all\n\n11\" air's hinges are sturdy af, compared to m3 pro (opened at 90 degree and poked both with a finger, m3 pro was a wobbly mess). Could be attributed to 11\" air's advantage of being 16:9 and thinner screen assembly.",
