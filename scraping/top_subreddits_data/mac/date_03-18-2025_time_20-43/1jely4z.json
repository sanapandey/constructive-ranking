    "selftext": "I hope this is the right sub, but I just bought a brand new 24-in. iMac (M4 chip) a month ago. I bought a  SuperDrive to rip some of my DVDs. According to Apple, it should be compatible with any Mac without an optical drive. It registers on my iMac in the system report and definitely turns on, but it does not accept any discs. I've tried booting the computer into safe mode, resetting the SMC, etc. It's connected to a USB-C port on the back using an Apple brand USB-A to USB-C adapter. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this by chance:(?",
