And the same goes with other standards like Human Interface Guidelines. Of course Apple will make the standards for Apple products.\n\nIn fact, I think it's far better that Apple has their own guidelines, created and maintained by themselves, because it means every single developer has a singular point of reference to make their app integrate correctly with Apple's own OS.\n\nWhat do you expect the alternative to be? For Microsoft to make Apple's guidelines? For 1000 independent developers to make a standard? Why would Apple *not* have standards for their own product?",

Most developers follow it, and even Microsoft team that made VS Code added ctrl + , shortcut to mirror cmd + , on Mac. That's because Apple and macOS is the ONLY desktop operating system with shortcut guidelines, at least with guidelines that developers do actually follow. Finding an app that doesn't support cmd + , is a quest, lol. I can't think of any tbh. cmd + shift + \\[ or \\] also works to switch tabs in pretty much every app, I just tested it in apps I use. I know for sure that on Windows this shortcut is different, like Mozilla Firefox on Windows does ctrl + arrow keys or some shit and cmd + shift \\[ or \\] on Mac, like any other app.\n\nI repeat, macOS is simple the only operating system with at least somewhat reliable predictability and consistency of shortcuts. In Linux/Mac/FreeBSD, guessing is nearly useless, some thing like ctrl + w seem to become popular nowadays, but it's influenced by Mac too, lol. I'm pretty sure Windows and Windows devs don't follow any guidelines that would result in every app having alternative of cmd + , shortcut (and other shortcuts too)",

On Windows, having the application close when its last window was closed meant that if I accidentally closed PhotoShop's application frame I would have to wait a minute or two for it to relaunch when I went to edit another photo (this happened rather frequently on my old Windows computer). \n\nWith OS X, I could have whatever applications I needed fully open and ready to use, even if I didn't have any active windows in those applications.",

That's not exactly the most reasonable demand, to be honest.  Nor does it take into account intellectual property law, which is not the most consumer-friendly entity we have to deal with, it turns out.\n\nAnd Linux is not \"however you want\" unless the customization option exists in the distro you use.  Otherwise, you may have to do an incredible amount of work to get it to be just the way you want, and that is also potentially problematic for people.  I've spent days on end numerous different times over the years trying to get some Linux distro or other to work the way I want, and it is not nearly as straightforward as some suggest.\n\nI'm not trying to say your opinion or concerns are wrong, by any means, but you're coming at this from what appears to be a rather incomplete perspective.

I might be wrong, but as far as I know you totally can scale macOS to any size you want, though in some cases you might need the help of a third-party tool like BetterDisplay to dial in certain exact resolutions if the default options don't work for you (which you can see in the Displays pane in System Settings if you enable the option to \"Show List\" of resolutions: [Change your Mac display\u2019s resolution - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-your-displays-resolution-mchl86d72b76/mac)).  macOS is weird in that it doesn't specify scaling as a percentage, like you normally see in Windows or Linux these days, but rather as a \"looks like\" resolution.  Maybe there's something about it that I'm missing.\n\nOne thing that it helps to remember is that Apple really had been on the vanguard of high-resolution consumer displays, so they came up with a fairly clean way of doing it (especially for their first \"Retina\" displays) that worked for most of their customers, in particular for 2D graphics and desktop publishing.  It just turns out that way has some fundamental differences from the ways Windows and Linux have later chosen.  Frankly, both Windows and Linux seem to have scaling issues to this day for displays with high pixel densities, and I run into little problems multiple times a week in Windows on my 4K displays at work.  I run Ubuntu in a virtual machine on my Mac with a 5K display and it has its share of issues as well.  macOS doesn't ever seem to have scaling issues anymore where text or buttons or other interface elements are cut off (like Windows and especially Linux do have).  But none of the solutions by any developer, Microsoft or Apple, have been perfect in my opinion, and I'm continually frustrated that Apple removed subpixel antialiasing in macOS back in 2018 or so (so that text now looks more blurry on non-\"Retina\" displays).\n\nUltimately, I do think Apple makes plenty of odd decisions when it comes to what the defaults are, like the way scrolling direction can't be independently selected between mice and trackpads (as you mentioned), and other stuff like that.  And there are tons of other issues, like Apple removing \"old\" features too quickly from macOS or from their devices.  I just tend to think we spend too much time acting like Windows is the default and that things should therefore work the specific ways Microsoft has chosen over the years.  Maybe sometimes they really should, don't get me wrong, but a lot of the ways each system works are simply matters of historical accident or necessity (for instance, a full-fledged solution didn't really exist yet to deal with scaling on high-PPI displays, so one had to be invented when Apple decided to sell \"Retina\" displays en masse).",
