    "selftext": "Giving up my dual 27\" monitor set up to a single laptop setup (giving up my office + desktop setup to turn it into nursery) and cant decide between a 15\" macbook air or 14\" macbook pro.\n\ni am mostly a gsuite (docs, sheets, slides) guy, consume a lot of youtube, and will be on the move going to coworking spaces 3-4x a week. i play league of legends for maybe an hour at a time so i will not be pushing the machine at all. pro seems overkill for what i need but beyond that, im mostly concerned about the overall size of the machine and if 14\" is too small for a full time daily driver.\n\nfor anyone that's made that jump down from a desktop setup to a 14\" laptop, hows it been? do you wish you could jump up to a 15\"?\n\nthank you",
