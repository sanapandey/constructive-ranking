    "selftext": "Hello everybody!\n\nI was doing some cleaning in my house and I found an old iMac Early 2008 stored in my garage. I've completely forgot about it. I plugged it in and it works, but in a horrifying slow way. Currently it's running Patched OS Mojave, maybe it is that, or maybe it's just it's age? I don't know. But my question is: Should I save it and maybe install a SSD on it and upgrade RAM to 6GB?, it will be just to watch some movies, youtube videos and stuff like that or should I put it on the trash or sell it by parts?\n\nThanks everybody!",
