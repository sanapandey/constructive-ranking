            "body": "lol \ud83d\ude06 I had a dent almost the exact same size next to the keyboard on my old 2015 MacBook Air. I dropped a large pair of vice grips onto it from about 10ft high. I just left mine alone because it didn\u2019t affect anything.   \n\nFor yours, I would definitely check the battery.\n\nI bet your battery is probably fine\u2026for now. But after a few months of resting your hand there, not so much. With the other side of the dent poking the battery repeatedly and you\u2019ll be posting this on r/spicypillow. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay Apple a fortune to fix it and your ok with opening it up here is what I\u2019d do;\n\n1. Take all the screws out of the bottom cover. You\u2019ll need a #5 Pentalobe screwdriver or bit, they\u2019re not expensive at all. The screws are all the same length except by the screen, so just keep track of em. \n\n2. Lift the bottom cover off from the back edge by the screen. You\u2019ll feel some resistance coming from the center. It\u2019s just plastic clips, carefully pull the bottom cover up and slightly away from you and they\u2019ll pop loose. \n\n3. Once inside admire how nice the guts of your MacBook look. Then disconnect the battery, I\u2019d look up a guide for the battery part only because the process can vary slightly depending on year and model. If you\u2019re patient and careful you can re-use the battery when you\u2019re done. \n\n4. Once the battery is out you can examine the underside of the dent. It doesn\u2019t look like it pierced through so it\u2019s unlikely there will be any rough edges or anything, but if there are sand them down so the lump is smooth. \n\n5. Find a very hard flat and smooth surface, like a block of steel or the back of a vice. Cover it with a towel so you don\u2019t scratch anything and lay the MacBook keyboard side down on the towel where the dent is. Prop up the rest of the computer with something if needed, but keep it level. \n\n6. It\u2019s now time to perform some \u201cpercussive maintenance\u201d. Get a hammer, nothing crazy, a small ball-peen hammer would be perfect. Also get a small block of wood, or better yet a small block of a softer metal like aluminum or brass. The block needs to be bigger than the dent. \n\n7. Place the block over the dent (from the inside) with the outside against the harder surface and start giving it some firm swift hits one at a time. Make sure to hold the block steady and check the dent in between hits. Don\u2019t go nuts, increase force only if you need to. You\u2019re repairing a dent in very thin aluminum, not making a horseshoe. This should go without saying, but watch your aim. \n\n8. Take your time with step 7 until the dent is nice and flat again. Aluminum is very soft so it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll still see a line or some lighter spots on the surface (like a small scar) when you\u2019re finished.\n\n9. Put everything back together.\n\n10. Use your MacBook knowing you saved close to $1000.",
