The second those things are airborne, it is a death sentence for anything living in its path. The only structures that are truly durable is solid rebared concrete, which is expensive. That's why most structures are \"cardboard\", it's cheaper to hedge the odds that your house won't get wrecked, and rebuild if it does.\n\nCloser to metro/suburban areas you see plenty of brick&drywall combos.

They are a nightmare to work with because you can't even get a pin in and sometimes even a nail can be a challenge depending on the board. \n\nAnd yes most walls in Germany that are put up during the initial construction are brick or for larger projects sometimes concrete. They last longer, if done correctly are less susceptible to moisture and mould, they potentially insulate better and are far more sound proof. The only real downside is they are probably a bit more expensive and they are a bitch to tear down or to have to do cable work on.",

This contributes to american construction being influenced more by economic factors than cultural ones. \n2. continuing this point, most american HOMES are made as cheaply as possible while still being a viable structure. this is a problem in its own right, but that\u2019s besides the point lol. \n3. natural disasters are becoming a bigger problem with climate change. my parents live in middle tennessee, which is not in tornado alley, but a year or two ago, there was a tornado that destroyed hundreds of buildings, even ones like schools and churches which are not as cheaply made as homes. \n4. i recognize this is kind of a stretch, but if we account for native americans, the architecture is pretty damn intuitive. those living in the southwest (which is hot and arid) had homes incredibly well adapted to the heat and sunlight. the inuit have an incredible understanding of snow, and we don\u2019t give them enough credit for the igloo, it\u2019s a truly fascinating design.",

You can't say \"Europe\" and then exclude arbitrary parts.\n\nIf you want to take the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger (not Koppen) map as a basis: Apparently not every 5 year old can read that map. Good on you for looking at colours though, truly the mental agility I'd expect of an American formed by the formidable US school system. The US is spanned by 24 zones. Europe is spanned by 17 zones.  \nSo while the US has more climate zones (a point I have never refuted), it is far from double (the statement I called out). And that includes all of the US as a country (with Hawaii and Puerto Rico) but only the continent of Europe, which you should really learn the borders for.  \nIf we wanted to treat Europe the same as the US (spanning each country's borders, something you took great offense at), we can add the Af and Am climates for Guiana, Dsd, Dfd, Dwa, Dwb, Dwc, and Dwd for Russia. So in total we'd have 25 climate zones. I can see why you're kicking and screaming at the idea of including those regions too.\n\nTake your pick if you want to tell me \"oh I only said the US has more colours\" and admit you missed what the original discussion was about (double, not more) or if you want to double down and try to find 10 more climate zones in the US. Hint: There are only 6 more the US doesn't cover.",

In most places there's no risk of hurricanes/tornados impacting houses and there's no seismicity (which timber-frame is actually more resilient to), so the supposed \"flimsiness\" is not relevant.\n\nSaying that brick is just better in all cases ignores the realities of modern construction techniques, material availability, and environmental factors.\n\nIn extremely cold climates, like [parts of Canada and northern US, where temperatures are -20 C on most days throughout the winter, with up to -30 - -40 C days/weeks being common](https://i.imgur.com/FnrcWlJ.png), the additional insulating capacity provided by timber frame construction is a legitimately better way of constructing a house for those climates. \n\nFor context, Norway builds houses in a very similar way to North America due to the availability of wood. Houses in Europe aren't built with brick because it's better, it's because it's easier and cheaper for them. Home builders the world around are not concerned with making your house bomb proof... they're concerned about money.",

Timber frame construction provides large gaps for adding insulation between the exterior and interior walls. A properly built timber frame house will have very limited heat leakage. I can't say whether there is or isn't more heat leakage from a brick house, but if brick was better heat insulation, more Canadians ([who experience -20 C averages throughout the winter, with -40 days being common](https://i.imgur.com/JhGPnlt.png)) would be building brick houses.\n\n>It's more expensive\n\nThis is also not entirely true. Timber-frame construction is cheaper in north America due to the abundance of lumber. European markets are very different. Lumber is far more expensive, making brick a more viable option. Contractors around the world are not concerned about making houses bomb proof, they are concerned about making money. If it was cheaper/easier for them to build timber-frame in Europe, they would. They are businesses, not people looking out for your safety and security. \n\nThere's also something to be said about culture, expectations, style, and contractor expertise that impacts the different housing construction styles around the world.",

Nevermind the fact that making a concrete home that is strong enough to withstand an EF4 or EF5 is going to be extremely expensive, potentially pointless if one never hits, and futile because Mother Nature doesn't give a flying fuck what the material is. When she wants to remind us how absolutely fragile and helpless we are against the forces of Nature, there is nothing stopping her. There is also the fact that concrete is going to be a lot heavier and if it collapses on you, it would just outright crush you or slowly suffocate you because of the heavy weight. You'd be a lot more likely to survive if those \"cardboard paper\" walls fall right on top of you.",

Good luck having your concrete building surviving a hurricane, much less the flooding and sitting water for god knows how long breaking down your concrete building. And even one crack in your walls or foundation (not all homes in the US even have a concrete foundation, in fact, in hurricane areas, it\u2019s pretty dumb to have basements/concrete slabs!) can cause massive issues. Having thousands of tons of water crashing through your house, not much is going to be surviving. \n\nNot to mention that wooden houses are much more ecologically viable than concrete, and even brick, since it\u2019s a 100% renewable resource that is farmed, thus providing pseudo permanent vast amounts of forests.",

They aren\u2019t made of wood. I\u2019m talking single family homes, which aren\u2019t nearly as strong as whole apartment buildings, concrete or not. A tree flying at your brick/concrete wall at like 100 mph+ is not gonna get stopped unless your homes are like 4 inches thick . \n\nOn a different note, I think a possible reason that European/other countries homes are made of concrete is due to them having seen war in the modern era. The us/canada has not seen any conflict, thus needing to potentially survive artillery etc is not ever a concern, while in the past it has been for EU. \n\nObviously the concrete is stronger, but we still have 100+ year old houses here in America, im in a 70 year old house, and it\u2019s holding up fine. The beauty of wood framed homes is that you can easily renovate for changing times. Just because our homes are made of wood doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t last. (And I live in tornado alley, so it\u2019s survived 70+ years of tornadoes.)",

Which is obviously totally stupid since you basically pay, so someone richer than you can pay off the mortgage of the house you live in. Total scam but thats a different topic.\n\nI think overall there are many reasons. Cost and climate probably being the biggest one. Then obviously government overreach (its bat shit insane how much paperwork and licenses and controllers etc you have here in Germany). A cheaper style US house wouldn't even be allowed to be build here. I still remember a tv show about people who left Germany to move to the US. One dude went to Texas and built his own resort.

Cat 4+ or a strong tornado/twister doesn't really give a fuck about brick. Anything short of rebared concrete and steel isn't going to make it, and even then it's gonna suffer damage from impacts.\n\nAnd when a brick building breaks up in a hurricane or tornado, you now have a tornado/hurricane that's chock full of bricks. Suboptimal.\n\nEuropean weather is extraordinarily weaker than American weather. From a glance, it doesn't look like there's been a single F4 or above tornado, and they just straight up don't have hurricanes.\n\nEuropean homes are made for European weather. Without extreme weather they can focus on longevity. There's definite advantages, like the raw durability and lifespan of a building. There are downsides too, like how much of a whore they are to upgrade, and the insulation can be kinda ass.\n\nCloser comparison would be, say, Asian countries, which built a lot of their homes out of wood and paper for the same reason. After a storm it's just easier and cheaper to fix or rebuild.",

[Here is the map btw.](https://www.circleofblue.org/2015/world/infographic-americas-septic-systems/)\n\nI didn't take it as an insult, but I just don't think the US has a good plumbing infrastructure in comparison to many EU states. \n\nHvac I can't refute, you guys are great at that. But plumbing is one I actually always considered the US to be lacking behind on.",
