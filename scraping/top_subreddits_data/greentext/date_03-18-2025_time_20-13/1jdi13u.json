Some better, some worse than USA but USA is actually pretty good overall. If you aren't an idiot the credit system will pay **you** to use their system.\n\nusing a credit card doesn't lower your score. Not paying your debts on time does.\n\nPaying back your loan early doesn't lower your score. I pay credit card weekly. (It can happen with personal loans but the hit is always small and temporary. It has to do with how credit scores are calculated and how much you owe/are using affects it. The calculation is complex and stupid.) \n\nChecking your score doesn't lower your score. Doing a hard inquiry does (and that part is a scam) but you'd only do this if youre about to make a huge purchase or think you are a victim of ID theft. Something the average person only does a couple of times in their life.\n\nNot taking out loans \"decreases\" your score only if you go a long time without using your card and essentially have no credit history for a long period of time. Would you loan a grand to an acquaintance you haven't heard from in 5 years?\n\nIf you aren't highly regarded like OP then you can game the system even while poor. My score is in the high 700s, sometimes bounces into the low 800s. I've never paid any interest (outside of actual loans) on a credit card and have made $400 on my most used card last year.",

Credit scores are literally just indexes that try to predict how likely someone is to default on their debt.  They are derived from a massive amount of consumer data and distilled by actuaries who are highly regulated and have to pass notoriously difficult exams to get into their trades.\n\nStatistics and data science sometimes produce conclusions that arent immediately obvious to laymen and that doesnt mean people are lying to you or trying to scam you.  For example OOP claims checking your credit score lowers your credit score.  This is false.  However checking too many times in a certain period CAN slightly lower your score- probably because actuaries determined that this is a small but non-neglibile signal that someone is a little more likely to default.  If we just think about it for a little bit it actually makes sense.  Someone who is obsessively checking their score may be preparing to take on more debt than they can reasonably handle or they may be struggling financially.  There are MANY little signals like this that can indicate higher or lower likelyhood of default.",

Media reports in the West have sometimes exaggerated or inaccurately described this concept. In 2019, the central government voiced dissatisfaction with pilot cities experimenting with social credit scores. It issued guidelines clarifying that citizens could not be punished for having low scores and that punishments should only be limited to legally defined crimes and civil infractions. As a result, pilot cities either discontinued their point-based systems or restricted them to voluntary participation with no major consequences for having low scores. According to a February 2022 report by the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), a social credit \"score\" is a myth as there is \"no score that dictates citizen's place in society\".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System?wprov=sfla1",

Not paying your debts on time does.\n\nPaying back your loan early doesn't lower your score. I pay mine weekly.\n\nChecking your score doesn't lower your score. Doing a hard inquiry does (and that part is a scam) but you'd only do this if youre about to make a huge purchase or think you are a victim of ID theft. Something the average person only does a couple of times in their life. \n\nNot taking out loans \"decreases\" your score only if you go a long time without using your card and essentially have no credit history for a long period of time.

They make the interest rate you agreed upon when you took out the loan and they don't have to worry about you not paying.\n\nThey would much rather make what they signed up to make at the beginning of the loan reliably, rather than tack on extra fees and have to possibly chase you down if you stop making payments.\n\nThat's basically what a credit score is - it's a marker of how likely it is that you'll do what you said you were going to do and make payments on time.\n\nThis is even true for credit card companies.  People who pay off their balance every month are more likely to spend more, and the credit card company makes money on the transaction fee when you buy things.\n\nThey would literally always rather make a little money on someone who is not risky at all versus more money on someone they might have to chase down in bankruptcy.",

Getting a new account also lowers your credit, but this is only because now the average age of your accounts is lower\n\n>Not using credit lowers your score \n\nNot HAVING credit is what keeps a score low. The more credit you have available to you, the higher your score, but also, the more of a balance you carry on a revolving account, the lower your score\n\n>Paying back late lowers your score\n\nAs it should, it indicates you are an irresponsible borrower\n\n>Paying back early lowers your score \n\nOnly when you are paying back an installment account in full. This is because the installment account is then closed, and your total number of accounts is decreased, and often times your average account age goes down. \n\n>Even checking your score lowers your score \n\nYou can check your score for free at any time without harming it. \"Checking\" your score doesn't lower your score, initiating a credit check does. A credit check is only initiated when you apply for loans and credit cards\n\n>Thinking about your score lowers your score \n\nA joke\n\n>Taking out loans lowers your score \n\nTaking out a loan only hurts your score in the short term because the average age of your accounts is lowered. Over time after receiving the loan, your credit will be better off than before you took the loan\n\n>Paying loans back lowers your score\n\nAs I said before, paying back loans only hurts your score because the account drops off your record, but over the course of having the loan, your credit will have improved more than the drop you get when an account is closed, so you'll have a better score than if you didn't have one in the first place.\n\n>Not taking out loans lowers your score \n\nThis bit is kinda true, lenders would like to see a mix of account types, but it's not that big of an impact, and you can have a great credit score without loans. You can even have a perfect credit score without every having an installment account, it just takes a bit longer to reach that way\n\nThe big misunderstanding I want to clear up is how both taking a new loan and paying off an old loan hurt your score. It is true, opening a new loan decreases your average account age and increases your number of recent inquiries; on the other hand, closing an installment account can often also decrease your average age of credit if you've opened new accounts between opening and closing the loan account. What's important to note, though, is that over the course of having that loan, your credit score was increased more than both of those dops combined, so on net getting and then paying off a loan slightly improves your credit score\n\n**TL;DR:** You don't need to take out loans (installment accounts) or carry debt to have good credit, you can easily get to a 750+ score by 24 or so with just credit cards that you pay back in full each month before any interest hits. \n\nYou can have a great credit score without ever paying a cent in interest",

Paying off loans means you stop being profitable, taking on another loan risks you being unable to pay all your creditors, so checking your score/having your credit checked hurts it.\n\nCredit scores are a measure of your potential profit factor to a corporate and nothing more.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should ignore it, having good credit is important to all American adults and I encourage everyone to get a credit card the day they turn 18 and start building credit responsibly. Being able to buy cars and mortgages at reasonable rates is hugely beneficial. Nothing keeps you in poverty like 21% interest on an auto loan for a car worth a fraction of the loan amount that you'll never possibly pay off before the car dies, forcing you to roll it over into the next horrid car loan. Arguably the only way to win is not play the game, but most people are never in a position at any points in their life's to opt out of the credit system. So the best thing most people can do is play the game right and leverage good credit to your advantage, minimizing how much money you throw away in interest to achieve a better life for you and your family.",
