You know, the difference between say Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul becoming mainstream while maintaining quality vs. Game of Thrones which started as a good and smart show but started dumbing things down to... I dunno why, actually. It's has to be the type of bs that only makes sense if you are an out of touch exec at a studio or something.\n\nBut there is a difference",
