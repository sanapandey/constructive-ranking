            "body": "I've said this a few times before: Something I hope we get to see happen between Alastor and Vox is a moment of mutual understanding between them, occurring somewhere during their inevitable face-to-face confrontation. A singular point of pure recognition where they momentarily see the extent of how each has been internally affected by the other's past actions.\n\nWhat I can imagine right now is Alastor and Vox alone together in a room or building. Only the two of them. There's no one around to stop them if they decided to start fighting each other; all it takes is one last battle to end this once and for all, and we all know who would come out on top.\n\nThe both of them eye each other, as if sizing up their prey. They're prepared to fight, knowing that this fateful day would come, and they'll finally be able to finish what they started. But they hesitate, instead waiting for the other to make a move first. This seven-year gap in their history has left a heavy feeling in the air. Every passing moment felt like it was building up more pressure to provoke either one of them to finally make their first move.\n\nThe tense silence is then broken when Alastor suddenly chuckles, *\"Long time, no see, old pal.\"*\n\nVox relaxes a little, noticing that Alastor is loosening his fighting stance. He can't help but chuckle back, replying, *\"Yeah, no shit.\"*\n\nJust to not make this too long: I imagine once Alastor and Vox are alone together, they both may experience some sort of nostalgic or sentimental feeling at one brief point. The two of them in each other's company, with no one else around and no one else between them, just like old times.\n\nIf they were ever tempted to drop that emotional mask in front of the other, it would be this moment. No one's around to see how they truly feel besides the one that they've suppressed those feelings about. So they let the mask slip, reminiscing in the pure comfort and enjoyment that their presence has always made the other feel.\n\nBoth of them even crack a smile at each other, almost reliving the genuine moment that they used to share in this one photograph.\n\nUnlikely scenario, but that's what this image inspired of me just now.",
