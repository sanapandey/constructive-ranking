Of course, with anything else dealing with sexual orientation, a sexuality is a spectrum. There are people who only feel sexual attraction when they have a strong emotional connection to someone (demisexual), or a person who is generally asexual but has conditions where they do feel sexual attraction under certain circumstances (grey-asexual). An asexual, while not really feeling sexual attraction to others, can still enjoy sex and still have a favorable opinion of sex (sex-positive). There are also those who are sex-indifferent/neutral or sex-repulsed/negative. \n\nFor aromantic, take the same idea and apply it to romance instead of sex. \n\nFor example. The most honest way to describe my orientation is homoromantic grey-ace pansexual. I am only interested in dating women, but gender does not matter to me when it comes to sex (though they do have to be feminine-presenting). But while I do enjoy doing it, and will accept it if offered (from those previously stated), I honestly don\u2019t care either way. If I was told by a doctor I would die if I have sex one more time, my reaction would simply be \u201cAh, damn. Guess I\u2019m not having sex anymore. Oh well.\u201d And I would not feel like I\u2019m missing anything important.",

It ranges from \u201cI can\u2019t understand flirting and shows of affection\u201d to \u201cI literally cannot love anyone.\u201d",
