Keep the cannibal happy and leave the neglectful mom alone like she wants and we are chilling.\n\nRoom 4: A megalomaniac cannibal deer, a depressed dad constantly crying about not being his daughters favorite, and  that one sexually abusive boyfriend you swear is more evil then the actual devil.\n\nNah this is the worst one no matter what happens its just actually hell. Either the deer gets you, you become the abusers play thing, or you have the emotionally wrecked dad drenching you in tears. Then theres all three bickering at each other until the sexual tension breaks and you finally enjoy peace to the sound of the deer and dad hate fucking each other while the sexual abuser video tapes it.",

Charlie oh her own has too much energy for me to handle, and all three seem like they'd get very preachy very quickly. I feel like I'd get dogpiled with \"positivity\" for not joining in the conversation.\n\nRoom 2 would be my second choice. Husk seems like he'd be super chill and good to chat with about random shit, from complaining about life and getting his feedback, to hearing stories about his past. Sounds like good times. Angel would put most of his focus on Peter and make dick jokes about his name, and would spend a lot of time harassing the two of them. It would be fun to join in that particular brand of harassment but would get annoying quickly. \n\nRoom 3 seem like they'd be some of the cattiest bitches. Rosie has a good head on her but also it doesn't feel out of character for her to egg Lilith and Serah on under the guise of advice. I cannot be stuck in another situation around people being catty and bitchy. Feels like I'd get dragged in. *On the other hand* they might also be super chill. This room really could go either way but the risk is too high for it to be worth it. \n\nRoom 4 would be far from chill but it would be a kind of \"just right\" situation. Valentino doesn't really seem to have any issue at all with Alastor and vice versa, they'd probably be really chill with each other and enjoy swapping stories about Vox, both seem *really* into gossip. I would enjoy just being the fly on the wall enjoying tea and just listening to them. I also feel like I would vibe with Lucifer, and talking about various personal projects. It seems like we could easily take turns info dumping at each other. Seems likely that, when they aren't gossiping, Alastor and Valentino would take turns antagonizing Lucifer, during which times I could just kinda hand with the other or just chill separately. I'm too ugly for Valentino to be interested so I wouldn't be a target, but I could just be a soundboard for his complaining about Angel or Vox or whoever.",

She seems to have purposely kept Charlie away from her father growing up, and then she just abandoned them both without a word. If you ask me it looks as if she resents him deeply and left him the first chance she got. She seems to care enough about Charlie to have Alastor look in on her but we still don't know for certain if Lilith is the one pulling his strings or if there is a 3rd party involved. Plus Sarah also seems REALLY problematic so Room 3 is definitely out. Room 4 is going to be violent, 1 of those 3 ain't walking out after quarantine and I'll give you a hint, it's Valentino.

Easily my choice.\n\nRoom 2- Peter seems pleasant enough, Angel wouldn't flirt with me because I'm a woman, and I'm sure Husk will leave me alone as long as I leave him alone. But... we'd just have nothing in common. It would be a weird month. (Side note: I imagined Angel trying fishing-themed pickup lines on Peter. XD Stuff like \"Whatcha fishin' for these days, Baby?\" or \"I wouldn't mind bein' your catch of the day.\")\n\nRoom 3- I don't fancy being eaten and I don't know Lilith well enough to trust her. As for Sera... she may not want to hurt me, and she's probably powerful enough to hold her own against the other two, but I don't want to hide behind her.\n\nRoom 4- Not advisable if you can't fight. And I couldn't fight my way out of a wet paper bag.",
