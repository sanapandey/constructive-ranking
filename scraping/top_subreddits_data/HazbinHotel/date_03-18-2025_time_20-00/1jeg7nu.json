In one possible timeline, he accepts that he's developed true affections for the others and becomes a pillar of strength upon which they can rely during times of crisis. Refusing to surrender when all hope seems lost.\n\nI doubt anything like that will actually happen, but it is fun to imagine him changing his ways and accepting that he cares about the others. Looking back on his statement that - *\"Ah, an enjoyable collective to be around. I must admit one could get accustomed.\"* \\- Getting over his own enormous ego for the sake of his new family. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uo3r4vzbxipe1.png?width=3401&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9227f4a0445950735b363e81bb0bcf5d62e78ef\n\nWhere he may not be the strongest in terms of abilities, but he might have the strongest will of them all. Refusing to give up on his ambitions and what he cares about no matter who stands against him. After all - *\"You of all people should know what a soul can accomplish when they take charge of their own fate.\"*",
