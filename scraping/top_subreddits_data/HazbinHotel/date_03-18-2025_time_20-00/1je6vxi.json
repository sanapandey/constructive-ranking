Verosika is more his style as she's also pretty energetic but Stolitz feels SO out of place. I think it literally only exists for the sake of starring a gay couple in the show, when\n\n A) the show went downhill IMO when it became a shitty high-school romcom/drama instead of the 3 little shits wreaking havoc on earth. Don't get me wrong, Blitz's insecurities, Loona's classist suffering and Moxxies Mafia background are all super interesting, but the Stolitz romance feels like it contradicts everything Blitz is as a person. He's selfish, mean and sarcastic, cartoonishly emotive when it comes to hype or frustration, and a sa whole unlikeable from an im-universe perspective. And that's fantastic. He's a DEMON. Season 1 was brilliant, and the shorts were my S2 highlight.\n\nB) Blitz working everything out with Verosika makes way more sense. If Blitz is gonna get all UWU touchy feely with anyone it's gonna be an eccentric succubus. Not some classy theatrical bird that neglects his daughter for the sake of the situationship he has with the bean headed traumatised peasant",
