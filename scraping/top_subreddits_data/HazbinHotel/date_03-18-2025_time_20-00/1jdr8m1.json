Calling each other names in an old school ship war sense is much tamer in comparison. Though arguing with antis is definitely a waste of everyone's time, I agree.",

I also have one where Velvette finds out Rosie is her great great grandmother.\n\nLute gets captured by Velvette, keeps her literally on a leash during the day and a giant birdcage during the night. Eventually they sort of warmup to each other and Vel lets Lute maul her underperforming employees as a treat. Every night Vel bitches about the other Vs, usually ending with Lute asking her why she doesn't just kill them. Eventually Lute breaks out in the middle of the night and tries to kill Velvette in her sleep but can't bring herself to do it because no ones ever been as kind to her knowing who and what she is as Velvette has and Velvette wakes up in the morning to Lute spooning her. Several awkward conversations and a few weeks later and Velvette has to get her room soundproofed and the bedframe replaced every week from all the sesbian lex. Eventually Lute gets \"rescued\" by some angels and brought back to heaven leading to Velvette joining the hotel to try and get redeemed and Lute trying to get banished to hell because they have no way to communicate and desperately want to see eachother again. Velvette gets redeemed and ends up in heaven like 5 minutes after Lute falls. Velvett asks where Lute is and is handed a newspaper and her reaction is similar to the letter scene in ratatouille. Meanwhile Velvette sprints to the V towers, finds out Velvette went to the hotel from a terrified intern. She almost sprints to the hotel immediately but decides to be romantic. She puts on a suit, gets a bouquet and a ring, steals Valentino's pimp mobile, and drives recklessly to the hotel as all her knowledge on cars she learned from Vals films. when she gets to the hotel she bursts through the door gets on her knee and yells \"Velvette will you marry me?\". This brings the party the hotel residents party celebrating Velvettes redemption to a grinding halt. Velvettes in the heaven zoo bawling her eyes out and hugging a polar bear after trying to get it to maul her while Lutes at the now ruined hotel party alternating between being catatonic and trying to drown herself in the punchbowl.",

No sex, but they're still loving and affectionate to each other. Also, it's not a far jump to say Alastor could simply be ace flux. So he could be demisexual specifically with his chosen partner (in this case Charlie) or Vox, or Angel, or whoever he's being shipped with. \n\nBut that's how I, as an ace person, would speculate at these things. It didn't stop the gay ships in the 70s of Kirk/Spock,  or in the 90s with Xena and Gabby. \n\nThough it's funny how Gene Roddenbary himself eventually said he could conceive of a special kind of love between Spock and Kirk that could range from brotherly love to sexual love. But given that Vulcan have 7 year \"heat\" cycles, Spock is ethically asexual as well.\n\nTherein you have the exact framework for an asexual/allosexual ship, even one with a sexual component.",

Given people can\u2019t use their brains apparently, I repeat: I am talking about ships like Charlastor that get unnecessary hate. In the 2010s, people were shipping Jack Frost and Elsa from Frozen and nobody batted an eye since they are from different universes. That is all I said.\n\nOriginal reply: No need to hit people with bricks. \ud83d\ude05 I do think there are too many orthodox anti shippers in this fandom. Charlastor gets hate other ships don\u2019t get, so much so, artists and writers have received death threats. I have said this \ud83d\udcaf times, Hazbin Hotel fans would not have survived early 2010s Tumblr. Shipping was everywhere and people respected ships. Those days are gone.",

So for example if character A and character B were together, but I might ship character A with a different character C, cause if Character A and B had never met, then A and C might have ended up together.\n\nSo for another example in the case of Hazbin, I would never ship a character against their canon sexuality. Otherwise I find it disrespectful to the character, and I adore these characters.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm against other people shipping those characters. We have a different take on it and ships I don't care for don't impact me.\n\nWhich is my point, that if OP claims that all ships should be respected, canon or not, then that should be the case. And there shouldn't be some weird exceptions dictated by one person. If you don't like a ship or a post - ignore it. No need to go around jokingly threatening violence because of it.",

These ships not being canon is *part of the appeal*.\n\nI would legit flip a table if Alastor canonically got a love interest. A lot of the fun for me is these are AU, and the enjoyment of them being an AU is like forbidden fruit. It tastes better knowing I can't actually have it in canon. Canonwise, it also soothes something in my ace heart to have Alastor be his awesome self without being forced into a relationship. He doesn't need to be \"fixed\" or tied to someone to be interesting.\n\nThere is one other thing I like about canon vs. fanon.\n\nCanon!Alastor is the mainstream ace rep I want shown to the world for purposes of grander understanding of asexuality (though I wouldn't be opposed to a different ace character in the Hellaverse being in a relationship to cover that base, since some aces do want them and are happy in their relationships. Maybe Octavia in future seasons?). I like that his platonic relationships are treated just as importantly as other characters' romantic ones, and I like that he isn't treated as naive about sex or that not having a partner is somehow a flaw. Most importantly, Alastor is evil and *happens* to be ace, as opposed to the usual ace(-coded) villains being evil *because* they're ace.\n\nFanon!Alastor (when written well) explores other areas of the ace spectrum in their own pocket universes. Whether it's a QPR with Lucifer, being married to Rosie for tax benefits, kinky exploration with Angel, or hell, even a universe where he and Vox figure out their shit are all fun. It allows exploration that the main universe can't cover.\n\nNow apply this to every other character in the Hellaverse and just swap \"ace\" with whatever their sexuality is.\n\nGo forth and eat the forbidden fruit!",

I replied saying this was a non-judgmental space, and I promised to draw their ship. They said it was Charlastor. \n\nSo in my next post, I credited everyone who asked for each ship with each drawing, except Charlastor. I wrote instead: \u201cNo username in case of bulling.\u201d\n\nI knew they would know that drawing was there for them, and I knew that my drawing would make them a little bit happier. \n\nShip what makes you feel good. And honestly? All of you are ripping into OP for including the piece where they say Zoophilia/Incest/Pedophilstic ships are bad. But if they didn\u2019t put that in, every single one of you would be commenting \u201cOHHH! YOU SUPPORT INCEST?? WHAT ABOUT CHARCIFER??? DO YOU SUPPORT THAT???\u201d \n\nLike, come on guys. You\u2019re better than that. Does it really hurt you so much to let someone be happy? If you personally disagree, that\u2019s fine! If you don\u2019t like the ship, that\u2019s allowed!
