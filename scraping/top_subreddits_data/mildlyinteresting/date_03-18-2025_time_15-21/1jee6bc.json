So one can of these was equivalent to 4 already kinda strong beers since 6% is 20% stronger than 5%. \n\nIf we gonna keep it calculated at 5% 12 Oz beer tho, then one Four Loko is close to 5 standard beers. Drink two cans of these Four Lokos and that\u2019s like 9 standard beers. Have anymore than that and you are 100% blacking out, then factor in the caffeine and energy drink supplements? \n\nAlcohol & caffeine mixed is similar to your brain as cocaine, you can look it up. So you were basically doing coke and drinking over 4 standard beers each time you downed a Four Loko. \n\nThats probably why these got banned. It\u2019s like you almost couldn\u2019t drink these without getting blackout wasted and doing something stupid. Nobody was gonna buy these to just drink one\u2026.",
