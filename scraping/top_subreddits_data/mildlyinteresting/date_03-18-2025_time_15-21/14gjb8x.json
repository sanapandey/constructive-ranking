    "selftext": "Dear mildlyinterested reader,\n\nWe want to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your patience and unwavering support during the recent turbulence in our community. Our subreddit is a labour of love, and we've weathered this storm together.\n\nRecent events have been confusing for all of us, from the vote, sudden removal of moderators, to conflicting messages from Reddit. As your mod team, we feel it's essential to clarify the situation.\n\nOn June 19, [the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes](https://redd.it/14dmkw1). However, before implementing these changes, Reddit took sweeping actions, removing all 27 moderator accounts without warning. This left us baffled and concerned.\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the events:\n\n1. On June 19, the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes. We announced the vote results and planned changes to the sub, including marking it as NSFW due to the common posts of phallic objects (no explicit content allowed). [CLICK HERE TO VIEW THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED AND LOCKED FOR POSTERITY](https://redd.it/14eox9x).\n\n2. A tug-of-war between the u/ModeratorCodeOfConduct account and the remaining moderators ensued, with the post repeatedly being removed and reinstated. Each mod involved was immediately locked out of Reddit. Subreddit settings were also unilaterally changed by the admin account.\n\n3. Eventually, all moderators were removed and suspended for 7 days, with the vote results deleted and the community set to \u201carchived.\u201d \n\n4. A lot of public outrage ensued, with details posted on r/ModCoord about what happened. At that point, no other subreddit had been targeted yet, leaving the situation uniquely unclear.\n\n5. Admin cited actions as an \"error\" and promised to work with us to solve the situation. For /r/mildlyinteresting posterity, this will henceforth be referred to as The Mistake\u2122.\n\n6. All our accounts were unsuspended and reinstated, but only with very limited permissions (modmail access only). For what it's worth, 'time moderated' for every moderator was reset (e.g. /u/RedSquaree moderated since 11 years ago, reset: currently showing moderated since \"1 day ago\").\n\n7. The awaited discussion never happened. Instead, the admins presented us with an ultimatum: reopen the subreddit and do not mark it as NSFW, or face potential removal again. The inconsistent and arbitrary application of Reddit's policies reveals a possible conflict of interest in maximizing ad revenue at the risk of user safety and community integrity.\n\n8. Finally, our moderation permissions were restored after we \"promised\" to comply with their conditions, but we kept the subreddit restricted while we ponder our next steps..\n\nProblems remain unresolved, and Reddit's approach to policies and communication have been troubling. We believe open communication and partnership between Reddit and its moderators are crucial for the platform's success.\n\nAs a team, we remain dedicated to protesting Reddit's careless policy changes. Removing ourselves or vandalizing the subreddit won\u2019t achieve our goals, but rather hinder our community. We're here to ensure r/mildlyinteresting isn't left unattended.\n\nWe call for the establishment of clear, structured, and reliable communication channels between Reddit admins and moderation teams. Teams should be informed and consulted on decisions affecting their communities to maintain trust and integrity on the platform. We shared this request with the Admin who promised to work with us, so far they have ignored it. \n\nUs mods are still deciding how exactly to reopen, not that we have been given much choice.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe r/mildlyinteresting mods",

            "body": "Let's play a fun game called: remember all the other times Reddit refused to budge and insisted the users and mods were wrong until they eventually backtracked: \n\n\n\n* Banning r/Jailbait (it's exactly what you think it is) after literal years of user and moderator complaints, only once the media finally picked up on the story. Before this, Reddit had even given the creator of the subreddit a unique personalized award for his \"contributions to the website\"\n\n\n* Banning r/beatingwomen and r/picsofdeadkids only after the media picked up on a popular Reddit post from a user\n \n\n* Banning racist and Islamophobic subs because of organized actions from r/AgainstHateSubreddits and media coverage (r/European)\n\n* Reddit \"not knowing\" what to do with the sub r /ni***rs - no, the actual sub name was not censored and it was about exactly what you'd expect it to be about. Took user and media outcry over a period of months for Reddit to ban the sub. \n\n* Taking action against Covid misinformation (on all sides!) after moderator outcry and media coverage\n\n* Reddit CEO protecting r/The_Donald despite countless reports from moderators of politically themed subreddits of it being used for organized harassment and misinformation campaigns  - only reversing its stance after widespread media coverage. **Then**, u/Spez also messing with r/The_Donald by editing people's  comments to make it appear they were harassing the sub moderators instead of himself. Steve literally doesn't care about any of us, no matter our position.\n\n* Using Ellen Pao as a temporary CEO and blaming all unpopular decisions on her, when in reality it was co-founder Alex Ohanian who pushed for those changes aggressively. They then used her as a sacrificial goat for community outrage after which u/Spez was made CEO and presented as a savior. \n\nSources: \n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-shutdown-controversy/\n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-teen-pics-problem/\n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-beatingwomen-misogyny-images/\n\nhttps://www.albawaba.com/loop/reddit-bans-racist-and-islamophobic-subreddits-1101936\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/does-anything-go-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-racist-corner-of-reddit/277585/\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-page-calls-on-site-to-combat-covid-19-disinformation-2021-8?r=US&IR=T\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/n7jqbx/reddit-cant-quarantine-coronavirus-misinformation\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-38088712\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/29/reddit-bans-pro-trump-forum-in-crackdown-on-hate-speech-344698\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/women-often-put-charge-failing-companies\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3dbwmb/cmv_ellen_pao_was_put_on_a_glass_cliff_by_reddit/",

                    "body": "Hey, \n\nI have a list of things reddit has either promised to make but never did or uselessly created features since the creation of new reddit and even further back.\n\nIf you want that list, I can send it over. Its currently on my subreddit rn but we are still private\n\nEdit:\n\nThe itemized list of things *I'm* specifically upset about are as follows:\n\n* They promised the ability for mods to modify CSS on a page within new reddit. It has been [6 years](https://old.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/66q4is/the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools/) since this was originally promised yet it still hasn't come to fruition. \n* They re-created chat from messaging (similar to how you get notifications) to the \"chat\" box. They also re-re-created so now we have \"legacy chat\" and \"chat\" which are functionally and visually identical. I wonder how much development time was spent on that.\n* They created predictions then sunset the feature within 2 years of it's original announcement\n* The new block system is terrible. Users can now just *block* mods and now there's no way for mods to check if an account is spamming or not without logging out or using alternative methods. In addition, this block system can completely block someone out from a thread, halting any and all conversation, rebuttal, or discussions happening.\n* Reddit cares is actively being used to harass people.\n* The always online indicator of new reddit is actively being used to harass moderators.\n* Moderators have been [banned for responding to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/12gywc5/most_of_my_moderation_team_has_been_banned/) which means it's pointless and difficult to respond to modmail without the active threat of not being able to moderate the subreddit. They say to message the mods of r/modsupport, but you can't send messages to mods or other users when you're suspended.\n* Followers are out of control. Only fans spam fills the followers list of anyone and everyone that I've seen active if they have followers enabled. Many mods included.\n* Chat spam is out of control. I'm sure this subreddit has seen it a lot as well as anyone who participated in r/WallStreetBets. These users create accounts specifically for messaging people \"hello\" only to put out a scam or otherwise spam/harass users. I've reported many of these accounts and got nowhere with them.\n* Polls were created but there was legitimately no way to determine who was voting in them, nor was there a way to prevent people who are not organic users of the subreddit from voting. Any poll is heavily astroturfed. Banned users can vote in polls as well as those who don't meet the minimum karma requirements to comment on the subreddit via automod rules.\n* Admins have stated that in order to get anything checked for vote manipulation, you must submit the *individual* post/comment for it. This doesn't do much good when your entire subreddit has this issue.\n* There is a distinct lack of pro-active tools used to help prevent brigading. It's always re-active which requires monitoring of hundreds of posts and thousands of comments (6 months worth). \n* The video player does not work for many users, including myself, on new reddit and the official app. This *still* hasn't been fixed, despite almost a year dedicated in r/fixthevideoplayer\n* The addition of [trackers](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmnj9xc/) that actively steal your data over 100 times in just a few minutes.\n* The lack of in-line modmail responses, so mods have to open EVERY modmail message in order to respond, rather than respond to them in-line from the notifications inbox similar to old reddit's response system\n* I *still* can't search my own or someone else's comments without using a 3rd party tool (which is now being banned). If I'm looking for a specific quote from something I remember talking about in April, I can't. The official app will require me to read EVERY post or comment I've sent between now and then, of which I will still likely miss it.\n* The removal of home feed sorting for \"lack of use\" after hiding it behind multiple menus.\n* Pinned posts *still* aren't guaranteed to be shown to users. We've had posts up for over a week saying we were going private yet we still got tons of people asking what was going on. \n* Reddit has poorly described features. Many users don't know what privating a subreddit means, nor do they know how to message mods (we still get people messaging us individually about their posts) nor is there a good way to tell how a post was removed (Whether it was by spam detection, mods themselves, specific links within the post, or crowd control). \n* ChatGPT bots are [running rampant](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a6pfg/over_1500_chatgpt_bot_accounts_banned_during_the/) and almost always spreading pro-admin statements about this protest that are clearly written by ChatGPT.\n* Reddit systems have [repeatedly gone down](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14ej7x8/modmail_down_for_reddit_app_but_not_in_rif/), often for more than 20 minutes at a time. This leaves our community vulnerable and your modmails unanswered. In the past 7 days, core features of reddit (such as modmail and loading content) have gone down for ~20 minutes approximately 9 times. That is a downtime of almost 2%, which in my opinion (as a software engineer) is absolutely ridiculous.\n* Reddit's API doesn't even work effectively at the moment. Numerous times has my automod gone down during the day, sometimes even going down once an hour forcing me to restart the program. If I'm asleep, there would be literally nothing preventing people from violating rules and posting spam. How can admins expect users to pay for access to an API that hardly works? \n* Subreddits that were private for legitimate reasons (harassment related) are now being forced open, even if they were private long before June 1st of this year\n* Subreddit mods were recently removed even after they opened up, which was the ONLY request they made towards mods\n* r/Minecraft has been [forced to open up](https://old.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/14dhki9/rminecraft_is_being_forced_to_reopen/), despite users overwhelmingly being in support of moderators privatizing the subreddit forever\n* Scheduled posts now must go through new reddit and are no longer able to be scheduled except through custom bot scripting.\n* Insights and user statistics are now only viewable on new reddit on the website. This is troubling because they've previously stated this won't be going anywhere. While it is more detailed, it also breaks many extensions that auto-redirect to old reddit as the url for THAT SPECIFIC MOD TOOL isn't *new.reddit.com* but is instead *reddit.com*. \n* They decoupled old and new reddit streams, so now they've not only doubled their costs to deliver content but they've also created a system where one goes down and the other is likely still up. For example, as of 9pm EDT on 6/20/2023, reddit went down for the second time today, but only on new reddit. This further serves to display it's unreliability.\n* There has been 0 effort to distinguish Porn NSFW and gore NSFW tags, despite 7-10 years of this feature being requested.",

It's a complete misinterpretation of statistics and fails to recognize the significance of more relevant demographics.\n\nTo explain the first point: It's a record of police *arrests*. Not convictions. Black people are disproportionately policed, this tends to inflate arrest numbers, yes?\n\nThe second: Poor socioeconomic status lends itself to higher crime rates. Higher population density lends itself to higher crime rates. These factors combine when considering that black people make up a disproportionately higher number of impoverished peoples within populous areas. When you look to the more rural side of poverty, it's disproportionately white, but with lower density *and* further from any police attention.\n\nRace has nothing to do with it. America did a piss poor job of undoing the generational damage that discrimination inflicted on black people within the country, that's what actually happened.

The conversation continued until you found an opportunity to try to justify your racist dog-whistle, and this is the most succinct demonstration of why you\u2019re here.\n\nI will [link your racist dog-whistle here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/14gjb8x/what_happened_to_rmildlyinteresting/jp7fk0l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3), and quote it below\n\n> It's literally just what official FBI statistics say\n\nAnd [I will link your clear defense of it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/14gjb8x/what_happened_to_rmildlyinteresting/jpek9wp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3), and quote it below. \n\n> AMasonJar and CCtenor are correct. I'm not doubting the statistics were true, the problem was that they were cherry picked to support a racist viewpoint. The copypasta left out a lot of other information and eventually was completely debunked.\n\n> What I wrote was in no way racist. Racist would be to advocate for treating all black people differently based on those statistics.\n\n> Also I do not know which full copypasta you are referring to that left out a lot of other information so I cannot take a stance on it.\n\n> \\> Stop arguing and work on your reading comprehension.\n\n> If you did not mean to imply that the statistics are false/fake, why did you say \"Anyone else remember the copypasta with cherry-picked criminal \"statistics\" that made it seem like black people were responsible for most violent crimes in America\" and why did you put scare quotes around \"statistics\"?\n\n> \\> I hope that settles everything and I have no desire to argue with you or split hairs over wording. I wish the best for your future improvement.\n\n> I am sorry, but I have been where you are and grown up and improved past it.\n\nAMasonJar, gorillakitty, pardon my inconvenience at mentioning you guys again, but I feel you guys should be aware how discussions with these type of bad faith actors end, and maybe use some of this information for the good you guys choose to put into your worlds.",

That's really sad.\nYou've done the time to reach that level of brain-rot on Reddit (of all places,) with 340k Karma as your badge of shame. You've spent tens of thousands of hours dropping 10+ paragraph posts like you actually have anything to say in them, and all that really comes out of that effort are situations like this, where you just embarrass yourself.\n\nNo real person thinks like that. They don't talk like that anywhere but here and Twitter, and those who do are just trying and get some clout, that's all. They don't believe what they're saying, and neither do you. This is why you're trying to drag other people here, because you want to be seen saying the right thing to fit in. You want backup, because you can't even coherently defend yourself when you're called out for insulting someone. You are an embarrassment. \n\n\nAfter all this time, and all those years of telling everyone else how things are and how they should be, you can't be right, not even once. For all the eloquent stupidity you vomit here on Reddit, all you've provided is years of undeniable proof you're hopelessly addicted to it, and talking down to people that know better than you in typical Redditoid fashion. \n\nYou know what? I'll even prove to you that you don't believe your own words.\n\nYou've said it's good to leave the site, that it's bad subreddits opened back up, that these protests were good, that you have no reason to think the Reddit administration is going to do anything good anymore, that you can't trust them, etc. etc.\n\nHere's the thing: You were still here posting on July 1st. \n\n\nNot fun to be talked down to, insulted, and lorded over, is it?",

Absolutely brilliant. I've never used Lucky Patcher but from afar, it always sounded kind of janky to me :D\n\nReVanced for Reddit is pretty new but YouTube, for example, I can't use without plug-ins like SponsorBlock anymore. It automatically skips parts of a video that someone marked as something. You can automatically skip paid sponsoring bits but choose to just display a \"Skip\" button for intro animations, for example. Going back to normal YouTube is disgusting... figuratively speaking. If technically possible, especially as Reddit continues with their plans, Reddit ReVanced might become god-tier! (Edit: As long as Reddit doesn't kill off their little trick.

They also support patching on your desktop or laptop.\n\nI will say it's not **super** user friendly, although it's a very good effort.\n\nEvery time I've wanted to patch something (TikTok, YouTube, and Reddit, so far) I've had to go to their Discord to find what specific version of the base app to start with.  The patcher is supposed to be able to tell you what version is suggested, but it often says \"any\" but doesn't mean it.\n\nPresently for Reddit the version to patch is \"2023.22.0 (968223)\", which can be found on APKmirror.",

They weren't user-targeted. They *sometimes* involved cookie tracking, but even that was rare. Usually they just contained query strings in the URL as a primitive way of determining where the click came from.\n\nWhen this was the case, many of us were perfectly happy to see the ads, because yes: it's a way to support sites you love. Sometimes we'd even click the ads intentionally, because clicks were always worth more than simple views/impressions.\n\nThat's changed. Everything has tracking. *Everything*. No matter how hard you try, even allowing an ad to load in your browser inevitably results in data being pushed into an ad provider's database, with data brokers leeching off it in the middle.\n\nI *hate* this, and I know I'm not alone.\n\nThe worst part is that it doesn't even make the sites I love any more money. 100% of the profits from these heavily-targeted ads go to the ad services themselves. Here's one small case study to illustrate this point:\n\nIn 2005, when Facebook was *brand* new and had a tiny user base of only college kids, they charged $7 CPM (ad revenue per thousand impressions). [Source.](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ad-sales-deck-from-2005-2014-11#advertisers-were-charged-a-7-cpm-5) $7 in 2005 is worth $10.90 today, adjusting for inflation. [Source.](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2005?amount=7)\n\n*This value is essentially unchanged*. [Source:](https://revealbot.com/facebook-advertising-costs)\n\n> Average Facebook CPM in June of 2023: $11\n\nIt's a race to the bottom. Ad providers harvesting more and more user-targeted data (because if they don't, they'll be out-competed by entities who *do*), and users don't benefit from this hyper-targeting, and the sites that serve ads don't benefit from this hyper-targeting.\n\nSo please pardon me if I'd rather just become a leech myself and do whatever I can to exclude myself from this nightmare even if it means that the sites I love are hurt in the process. As far as I'm concerned, the only \"good\" outcome would be a return to the old ad paradigm. But that's not going to happen, so yes: I will block every ad I can, no matter the consequences. Given my other options, this is the best choice.",

Send formal citizenship checks to governments based on a screen name or email address? The wording is also extremely vague and not anywhere near as precise as anyone would like.\n\nThe GDPR mostly applies to activity that takes place within the European Union. So it's not so much about the person who is performing that activity, it's about where the data comes from. So citizenship, place of normal residence... doesn't actually matter that much. If you've ever used Reddit in Europe, you're probably covered in practice, because at least *some* of your data originated in the EU and there's no way they can be arsed to split hairs over it.\n\nMost companies that are GDPR-compliant are not going to get into the nitty gritty of where you're currently sitting or where you were sitting when you gave them each piece of your data - that would require time and effort that's just not worth spending, so instead they just have a GDPR request button that they hit to field GDPR enquiries. They don't actually have to give a shit about the validity of the request once the tooling exists to field the request, because what's the value to them in rejecting it?\n\nAll the button will probably do is change which data is included in the dump and Reddit's reporting and analytics (so that if they ever get in trouble over one of these regulations they can go \"look, we provided data to 145,919,258 people, please believe that we're super compliant!\").\n\nThe only companies who do care are probably not actually *really* GDPR-compliant because they're pulling the data manually, which is a huge pain in the ass, and hoping that nobody does it. There is zero chance Reddit is one of those, as hilarious as that would be (but I did used to work for a company like that, I'm still trying to figure out how vengeful I'm feeling).",

GDPR is a 500lb gorilla for any company and refusal to comply simply from the IP address the request comes from is reckless from a company governance standpoint. It could cost the company 4% of its worldwide annual global income from even a single substantiated complaint.  Definitely a 7 or greater on the FAFO gradient scale.\n\nAnyone looking seriously at this companies IPO would take all this into consideration.  if GDPR and CPRA issues start cropping up along with the already widely known ADA issues, and realize this stock is about to exceed the Marianas trench as the lowest point on the planet reached by humankind.

The EU and the US are both massive entities with some considerably different protections. I'm no legal expert on this stuff, but it seems like Reddit skirts around labor laws due to their decentralized model - most mods are hobbyists who manage subs about their passions. Once you get to the major subs, things seem to get a lot murkier, though. \n\nSure, Reddit has a responsibility to police certain content, but their direct meddling in community affairs brings their role into question. Taking charge of communities that are following both Reddit's guidelines and the law, and going as far as replacing mods or shutting down subs, blurs the line between being a community platform and exploiting moderators for free labor. In the past, we've mainly seen this in subs pushing legal boundaries or extreme cases potentially making Reddit liable. But this case is different. This is clearly a response to their policy changes and their bottom line.\n\nYes, they have the authority to regulate their content. There are still limits on what they can demand from unpaid mod and a situation where they are attempting to unilaterally remove entire mod teams and select their replacements, from a labor standpoint, sounds sketchy to me at best. There being plenty of other people being willing to do the job for free doesn't justify it. \n\nThat's likely why the admins chalked up the action as an \"error\". Even if it's all currently in a legal gray area, Reddit has nothing to gain by pushing to the point where they end up in court.",

Pao was already unpopular enough, after the company shut down controversial \"subreddit\" communities like FatPeopleHate, and for many of Reddit's die-hard users, Taylor's dismissal was the last straw.\n\nBut if Wong's story is true, then it was really Ohanian's decision to let her go, not Pao's--something that Ohanian had hinted at in a Reddit post of his own, but never said outright. Meanwhile, Wong holds Ohanian responsible, even though Ohanian was supposed to answer to Pao and not vice versa.\n\n\n\"When the hate-train started up against Pao, Alexis should have been out front and center saying very clearly 'Ellen Pao did not make this decision, I did,'\" wrote Wong. \"Instead, he just sat back and let her take the heat. That's a stunning lack of leadership and an incredibly s***ty thing to do.\"\n\nIn a reply to Wong's post, Ohanian said \"It saddens me to hear you say this, Yishan. I did report to her, we didn't handle it well, and again, I apologize.\"\n\nWong replied saying that the company did \"tremendous amounts of unnecessary damage,\" and defended Pao by saying that she \"handled things very well, and with quite a bit of grace given the prejudices arrayed against her and the situation she was put in.\"\n\nWong himself abruptly quit Reddit late last year over what was apparently a dispute over office space. Pao served in the interim CEO job until last Friday, when she resigned. Steve Huffman, who co-founded Reddit with Ohanian in 2005, got the nod for the CEO job, full-time.\n\n--This story first appeared on Business Insider.",

Treating them like misbehaving schoolchildren, restricting their ability to mod, and even deleting their historical stats from the record all feel like manipulation tactics to get them to quit without directly banning them outright. I hate to say it would have worked were I in their situation, no way I'd take that treatment and stick around",

Artemis is specifically designed to work with kbin, not sure if or when any of the other ones will go in that direction or become interoperable as there are some challenges with the kbin API at the moment. Having said that, a new API is in the works (https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/pulls/357) so things should get better with time.\n\nSome of the apps are in a very early stage of development so it may happen that they adjust OS availability and platform support.",

Why they decided to become their own image/video host is beyond me, as hosting that content is hugely expensive for no real gain. If they had third parties willing and able to host it for them, why not continue with that zero-cost option and reap the benefits?\n\nThe other dumb thing here is that there are plenty of other monetisation options that actually work with how Reddit operates as a platform. They could have introduced additional Reddit premium tiers and included API access in one or more of those. Probably the best thing they could have done is pivoted into a Patreon competitor. There are plenty of content creators and people making physical items (First thing that comes to mind is the TTRPG community with digital maps and physical accessories) that already use Reddit to advertise their products & services, so why not give them a way to make a paid subreddit with multiple tiers that would effectively be a Patreon feed? Not to mention the hordes of posters advertising their Onlyfans or other similar platforms... Give them a good way to sell their stuff on Reddit and they'll probably see a large uptake on that. It's a much easier proposition to have a Reddit user stay on Reddit than to move off-site, and once a user has attached a payment method to purchase content/goods from those creators they're much more likely to use that payment method on Reddit premium and buy coins for awards.",

The blackout is affecting you _because_ so many third-party app users, and those who empathise with third-party app users' position, are in a position to affect you. They're the ones who keep the site going. If those users had no impact on your Reddit experience, their protests would have gone unnoticed.\n\nSo when you say it doesn't affect you, you're wrong. Yes, you might not be _directly_ affected because you don't personally use a third-party app. But people who _do_ use a third-party app quite clearly create content you consume and moderator subreddits you use and have an effect on your Reddit experience. The changes affecting third-party apps have very obviously had an indirect effect on your own usage of Reddit.\n\n> Mods are volunteers. They aren't beholden to doing work if they don't wanna do work. It really is that simple. Someone else who won't complain about it will do it. And that's a beautiful thing.\n\nAgreed. New subreddits can be created, too. There's no reason for a user to spend time in a subreddit where they dislike the moderation style.\n\nOf course, that \"someone else\" likely won't be able to do it as efficiently with the massively reduced mod tools available on the official app compared to third-party apps. And with toolbox's creator leaving Reddit. And with the lack of institutional knowledge and experience that established moderation teams have. And without any onboarding. And without the custom bots a lot of subreddit moderators have created for themselves, of course.",

It has truly made this place special.\n\nNowadays, most semi-popular non-serious subs have become so repetitive with endless reposts, or lack of rigid moderation enforcement from mods due to fear of \"losing users\". Lots of once great subs became shit due to this (/r/MapPorn, /r/dataisbeautiful are two that immediately come to my mind).

They acted hastily against us, planning to use the NSFW content excuse, then had to correct the mistake because that was patently false and would have looked even worse.

It is PRICELESS!!!!\" and it doesn't even make the cut for the show because EVERYONE brings in their 90 year old heirloom bible.  The show presenters have to struggle to not roll their eyes and gently tell the person that it's basically worthless to collectors.\n\nBut then someone comes in with some detached doll heads, chipped, kind of stained, and they're like \"Idk where these are from, my grandma had them?\" and the curators go completely apeshit over them because they're the last known evidence of a line of porcelin dolls that were all thought to be lost in a bombing in WWI or something totally wild like that and they're worth a cool quarter million dollars.\n\nBasically, our subreddit (and subreddits like it) need people who know their shit.\n\nBecause there's a lot of people who submit the photo equivalent of their family bible and we have to politely tell them that it's the fifth photo of a woman nursing that we've seen that day.  And not enough people who accidentally submit startlingly authentic, totally accidental recreations of Michelangelo's Temptation of Saint Anthony.  (And even more people downvote it until we swoop in with a comparison photo [and it becomes one of our most upvoted submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalRenaissance/comments/kr4e9l/pandemic_dad/))\n\nWe even got a lengthy writeup at the Washington Post for our work: [https://archive.is/V0PzH](https://archive.is/V0PzH)",

I am making reddit money by having an account, commenting, posting, voting, and seeing their ads. They use my data for their algorithms, they feed my data into AI, and they sell my data to companies. You're goddamn right we have a right to complain about it.\n\nAnd that's not even covering the fact that people like me LIKE this site for what it used to be. I like having a front page full of subreddits of stuff I like, being able to filter out the political bullshit and anything else found on r/all. You can't do that on any other big site. I have had many many really good, insightful, and often extremely hilarious discussions with people on this site. I don't want to see it go. I don't want to see it turn into another goddamn Facebook or Twitter. But that's what the admins want. And apparently wanting that to not happen is \"demanding\".",

Or do you somehow not know what actually happened? \n\nNo one was upset that Reddit had to increase its API price. The problem was all the lies and maliciousness. The problem is that Reddit has promised for years to provide tools that mods need. They can't even check modmail on mobile, for example. So they had to use third party tools.\n\nReddit said they would work with third parties. But not only did they price the new API way too high, where devs would need to go into debt by $10 million, but they refuse to slow roll the changes. This is despite Reddit always promising they would not try to remove third party apps. \n\nThen there's the lie about a dev trying to blackmailing them, only proven false because the dev recorded the call. There's reporting that lie all over the media. There's that AMA where Spez is a complete jackass, and now says the problem is that he dared leak the phone call to prove them wrong. \n\nAnd that's not getting into all the stuff that you should have read about the protest. Reddit is violating their own rules in how they are dealing with this. They could just delay the changes. They could do anything, but they instead abuse their power by rewriting the rules to punish mods for trying to protest. \n\nAnd, frankly, you're utterly wrong about everyone not siding with the mods once they find out. Surely you've noticed how little upvotes you get. There are a lot of people who use this sub--that can't happen on its own. \n\nReddit is rewriting the rules to hurt mods, rather than just letting them have the tools they need to do their job. And you'd rather attack the mods. \n\nAnd, for fuck's sake: if it was bots, Reddit can detect them and remove them. They wouldn't need to do this if it wasn't actual users. Just because you don't care about something doesn't mean you can't be in the minority. \n\nAnd, FYI, I had to shorten that down tremendously. Find out what happened. Find out that Reddit reneged on their promises and made up lies. Find out that Spez says he thinks the way Musk handled Twitter is a good thing. \n\nAnd stop siding with the rich over the volunteers who put in years of effort. If you must hate people in power, look at those who have real power.",

I barely frequent these subs as well, mostly like you, auto subbed or subbed from years ago. I saw every single poll and I could vote in every single poll (despite them all being setup in different ways). They were public and all up for at least 24 hours. Many subs even did it in a way that only users who had X karma on that sub could vote to avoid what you\u2019re calling brigadiering. The outcome was the same. \n\nWhether you like it or not, there **are** people who care about their user experience on this site. Whether it\u2019s mods of subs that I frequent (or at least, used to frequent) and their tools, or whether it\u2019s people like me losing my third party app experience, these changes and the way they were deployed/handled is a joke.

If you're a small enough sub, mods can literally enforce that the earth is banana-shaped as a rule, or establish their own high-school level promotion channel for a specific American school, even if the sub is ubiquitously named science or philosophy. Or if you have a legal matter sub that has become so hung up in US Democratic narratives that it literally is contradicted by the actual text in the reports (which they then ban you for even pointing out). The content being insane, that the mods are comically fascistic to the point where Eichmann would have been skeptical -- it has no bearing on anything whatsoever. As you point out, even subs dedicated to calling for actual law-breaking are not really a concern until their posts pop up at all or popular.\n\nEven though calls for holding ubiqitous subs (i.e., law, philosophy, science, etc.) to a slightly higher standard, or at the very least purging the mods every year or something like that - has been a long-standing request from - admittedly - a dwindling number of users over time, as they continue to get banned, or just settle in their own 40-people communities. This kind of content-moderation doesn't happen on Reddit in general, and never will. A /law sub that has to do with law rather than worship of the latest Muller-report leaks? Has no bearing on the advertisement revenue. No one is going to say: oy, this humorously insane sub is claiming that the earth is banana-shaped, and are calling on politicians to acknowledge them in the comments. This will stop us from selling hand-cream! Doesn't happen.\n\nWhat does affect Reddit's content policy, on the other hand, is the same that affects all other social platforms: does it negatively affect advertisement revenue. Or /appear/ to have a detrimental effect on it. And lack of clarity on that from Reddit has been a kind of wish to appear idealistic, on trying to be agnostic about it. Instead of them simply declaring - like face, twitterx and so on have - that they're just going to deamplify or bury anything that advertisers, state, CISA, private foundations, EU's twitter-domos, don't like with automated filters running outside the system otherwise. Which frankly is an ok solution, given that you are transparent with what you're doing. Because it really doesn't affect anyone who isn't invested in getting content on all or pop.\n\nYour sub, in that context, runs afoul of reports from brigades, irate former mods, and so on, that want to get the sub marked as sexually explicit. And by trying to do this in some consistent way - you're just creating bad press for Reddit, and getting problems by being in conflict with their content policy from a sheer PR-perspective. \n\nSo what did you actually expect?",

Six months of use. We're good. That's mostly a joke.\n    \n    Reddit: Six months of use? What do you mean? I know you said that was mostly a joke, but I want to take everything you're saying seriously just to make sure I'm not - what are you referring to?\n    \n    Me: Okay, if Apollo's opportunity cost currently is $20 million dollars. At the 7 billion requests and API volume. If that's your yearly opportunity cost for Apollo, cut that in half, say for 6 months. Bob's your uncle.\n    \n    Reddit: You cut out right at the end. I'm not asking you to repeat yourself for a third time, but you legit cut out right at the end. \"If your opportunity cost is $10 million\" and then I lost you.\n    \n    Me: No, no, I'm sorry. Yeah one more time. I was just saying if the opportunity cost of Apollo is currently $20 million a year. And that's a yearly, apparently ongoing cost to you folks. If you want to rip that band-aid off once. And have Apollo quiet down, you know, six months. Beautiful deal.

I didn't mean that to-\n    \n    Reddit: I'm going to very straightforward to you too, it sounds like a threat. And I'm just like \"Oh interesting\". Because one of the things we're trying to do is say \"You have been using our API free of cost for many, many years and we have absolutely sanctioned - you have not broken any rules.\" And now we're changing our perspective for what we're telling you - and I know you disagree with it. That hey, we want to operate on a thing that is financially, you know, footing. And so hopefully you mean something completely different from what I said when you say like \"go quietly\", I just want to make sure.\n    \n    Me: How did you take that, sorry? Could you elaborate?\n    \n    Reddit: Oh, like, because you were like, \"Hey, if you want this to go away\".\n    \n    Me: I said \"If you want Apollo to go quiet\". Like in terms of- I would say it's quite loud in terms of its API usage.\n    \n    Reddit: Oh, go quiet as in that. Okay, got it. Got it. Sorry.",

To me it seems to take as long as removing a post; tap username, tap ban, enter relevant info, tap ban.\n\nThere is no shortage of problems moderating via the app, such as comments not loading if you click on them through mod queue (if you're trying to see the context), or the difficulties in modding a gif post versus other types, or the queue forgetting your position and bouncing back to the top or out of the queue. Certainly room for improvement, and not as good as desktop, but functional.\n\nMaybe I haven't encountered some of the issues a niche or really big subreddit might encounter, and my time moderating on a 3PA was limited.\n\nOkay, so the basis is then working along with the broken windows theory and assuming that moderating via the official app is not an adequate alternative.\n\nI appreciate your insight.",

Without toolbox, you have to go to the subreddit's ban page in a separate tab to do so. Instead of just hitting the little 'M' by the username everywhere (when on old.reddit).

And please, I'm looking for an actual possible answer beyond \"CUZ ADMINS ARE BIG DUMMY HEADS.\" Are they that badly understaffed, and just don't have time to talk to mods for some reason? Do they consider communicating with mods a wasted effort? It really seems like that *should* be a huge part of their job. Are admins concerned more with drawing in revenue instead of keeping Reddit actually running properly, maybe?",
