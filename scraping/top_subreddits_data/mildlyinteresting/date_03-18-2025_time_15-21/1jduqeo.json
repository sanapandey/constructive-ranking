We use essential oils which are not synthetic fragrances and very diluted. A fragrance-free version is available)\n-Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin - This is the preservative we use to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and mold.

In the 1970s there was a drive for an initiative to be put in effect in the US to begin putting bidets in all public restrooms, as it was proven that it was the best way to fight E. coli. In Massachusetts a bidet was installed into every public restroom, but it was found that these were a massive waste of government money and a nuisance to the public. It was found that people just left them on, and unlike a toilet that could contain the water, bidets squirt it out in front of them, and you could imagine that this created a problem.\n\nPublic restrooms were reportedly found to always be flooded with water, causing a disturbance to the public, a health safety risk as water on a restroom floor is a great way to spread disease carrying human shit, and a physical risk due to people slipping, and this resulted in a neverending wave of complaints and even some lawsuits. Eventually most restrooms just turned the bidets off so they couldn't even be used, and they stopped being installed in the rest. Enough time has passed now that these restrooms have almost all been renovated, but a few public restrooms in Massachusetts still have a bidet in each stall, usually not in service.\n\nBesides, most Americans were confused by bidets or just didn't want to use them, so it was a massive waste of time and taxpayer money, and not to mention I made absolutely everything here up. I'll add an extra sentence though so nobody can skip to the end and see my bullshit. Basically it was a good idea in theory but it didn't end up working, and most proposals afterwards have barely left local courts.",

We use essential oils which are not synthetic fragrances and very diluted. A fragrance-free version is available)\n-Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin - This is the preservative we use to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and mold.
