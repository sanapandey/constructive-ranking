You can boil them, roast them, or eat them raw. A couple of types are toxic and if you live in the city you should be careful of harvesting from trees that are not on your property (you never known what people may have sprayed on or near them).

I don\u2019t see this jam being sold often, and when I do there is usually just one brand available. So I just take it. \n\nHowever what I noticed is that jam from bigger manufacturers can be stored for longer without turning into solid goo. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen pinecone jam with additional flavoring unfortunately. Hope I\u2019ll have a chance to buy something like this one day\n\ntldr: Brand doesn\u2019t really matter. Just order the first jam you see",
