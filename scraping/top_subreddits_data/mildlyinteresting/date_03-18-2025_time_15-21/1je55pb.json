It was indescribable. \n\nIt tasted slightly better than Rally's/Checkers and slightly worse than BK but it was literally hot and it was fast. \n\nIt was also the cheapest deal at the time. $2.99 for the equivalent of the big Buford (double patty, all the toppings), fries and a drink. \n\nYum! Brands bought them and tried to expand with it quickly and ran it into the ground in a short while, forcing just about every location to close, except for the original one on Midland, MI.",

Hints of symmetry, but the details are randomly lost because the tool couldn't pick the details up. Setting output to a 2 color palette can also give you the random and abrupt black to red color changes as well, on the lines below PIZZA the \"H\" in the first \"hot.\" The dots being different sizes and shapes too.)\n\nI work in print and recreate a lot of crappy art, and wanted to give my uwarranted professional opinion.
