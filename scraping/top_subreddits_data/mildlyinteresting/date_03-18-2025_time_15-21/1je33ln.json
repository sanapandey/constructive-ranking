So your softened hard water would have 0 gpg hard ions and 11 gpg soft ions.\n\nI'm not sure what causes the difference in sensation, whether it's the complete lack of hard ions, or the higher level of soft ions.\n\nBut, if the difference is the lack of hard ions, replicating the feel of natural soft water is as easy as adding a metered amount of hard ions back in.\n\nIf the difference is the high amount of soft ions, you'd need to RO all your water and then dose in your preferred levels of both hard and soft ions.",
