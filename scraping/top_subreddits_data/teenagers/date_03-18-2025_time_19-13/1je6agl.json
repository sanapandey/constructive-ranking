Thats so oddly specific\nAnd last i checked, theyre still going at it. So not depleted. Underestimating your enemy will cause you to fail. \nVietnam wasnt even our \u201cwar\u201d It ended diplomatically then after we left they went right back at it and they ended up losing. Oh well, most Americans didnt want that war. \nThe US is one of the major trading partners with Sweden goofball.\nIll value alliances when they start pitching in more. EU nations depend on the US, the US doesn\u2019t depend on EU nations. \n\nYour prime minister will kiss Americas ass. Hate to break it to you.\n\nAlso, The EU cant even handle supplying Ukraine with ammunition. Your industrial complex is just not there.

I\u2019d like it if the weapons don\u2019t leave there, and it\u2019s just a space for people to do exactly what you said. Go have fun shooting cool guns. I\u2019m all for families being able to own a hunting rifle, or even a pistol if absolutely necessary for self defense. \n\nI agree that there are plenty of people who make their decisions based solely off their emotions, and I think that social media has only riled people up even more by showing people what they want to see. Everybody is so stuck in their own echo chambers that many miss the big picture of what\u2019s happening inside and outside the country. I\u2019ve paid attention to left, right, and center media outlets to try and get all sides, and I\u2019m sorry but what most conservatives are pushing these days seems to do nothing but hurt the average working man, while benefiting rich stockholders and billionaires. I mean, for Christ sake, Elon Musk has given press conferences from right beside the presidents desk while his young son directly made fun of Trump on camera. I\u2019m not a fan of Trump, but that still kinda freaks me out, because if that\u2019s what happens on camera, just imagine what could be going on behind closed doors! There are countless reasons to hate Trump, his administration, and everything they stand for. There are also plenty of reasons to dislike the democrats. Unfortunately I\u2019ve only got two choices though, because the people in charge have pushed the two party system so hard that most of America treats politics like it\u2019s a fucking football game between their two favorite teams. \n\nOver the last decade or so, things have gotten ridiculous. Every side is turning the workers against each other, while the people in charge screw us out of our money again and again. I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m sick of what America has become; and unfortunately there is absolutely nothing I can do about it but try to hold out hope that we\u2019re not heading for complete destruction.\n\nThe planet is warming up at an alarming rate. We\u2019re actively turning our allies against us, while cozying up to ruthless dictators who would love nothing more than to take global power from us. Average people are so focused on fighting each other that they don\u2019t notice or even sometimes cheer on the Rich taking our money. There are people dying of diseases that we\u2019d nearly gotten rid of. There are hungry children who are denied food. There are innocent people who came here for a better life who are being taken from their families and held without trial. Why shouldn\u2019t humankind try to help bring up those who need help? Why do we let people suffer? Why can\u2019t people have any empathy and compassion? It\u2019s all gone in the name of saving a quick buck, and stuffing it in the pockets of those who already have everything they could ever need. \n\nThere is so much sadness in this world, but as long as it\u2019s the \u201cliberals tears\u201d then it\u2019s fine right?

I see the point of them, its a great means to get things done. Its kind of interesting to see how a 25% tariff has shaken things up to get countries to step their game up. The border for instance, is now more secure and thats by both US and Mexico. \nI have no issue with good people coming into this country, but doing it legally would be preferable. Yes, the whole process is completely jank and needs to be fixed to make it actually better and easier to have quality people come. \nI have personally helped sign off for getting a friend get his work permit.\n\nThe US has funded everyone, and honestly i think its ridiculous. Why are our tax dollars going to places that hate us when we have homeless vets on the streets, homelessness is high, and yes, people being hungry. \nI think it\u2019s completely disgusting that California for instance has spent billions to \u201chelp fix\u201d that problem. Yet it only got worse even though theyve put a massive amount of money into it. Makes you wonder where that money is going. Yet during covid they all had tiny homes, now those are gone.\n\nAs for musk and doge, most if not all of those \u201cemployees\u201d are working for free. People are hating musk for emotional reasons and just because hes doing it with trump. Lets be real about it. \nBack in 2010, obama admin, and many democratic politicians are on camera calling for the same thing. Now its a bad thing? Its just emotional garbage. Because orange man bad. Its a dumb argument.\n\nThe pentagon has never passed an audit. \nMost military branches havnt passed an audit, except the marines. They have. \nWhy is the airforce spending 80k on a bag of ball bearings. These are things that have been talked about in hearings. Makes you wonder what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nYou cant save everyone, but as a country we need to focus on home first before we deal with other peoples problems.\n\nNow heres a little history lesson, russia wanted to join NATO multiple times. Even during the clinton Admin. They kept denying it. Probably because \u201ccommunism\u201d or whatever. But hell, if we want a world that works together dont we need to start?\n\nAs for \u201cclimate change\u201d i think its a little bogus. Theres alot of science that disproves the claims. But the US has done alot better with \u201cclean\u201d energy \nThe biggest contributors are infact china and india. \n\nAs for guns, guns are not the issue. Its people, unless your sig then yeah your gun might go off on you for no reason lol. But jokes aside, the numbers for \u201cgun violence\u201d are disingenuous. 60% is self inflicted.

Your family, who id assume is around 10 people if you counted extended family like aunts, uncles, etc, is a drop in the bucket to the total voting base.
