Women are so strong that they can't take it out on men who SA them and instead take it out on the ones that don't. Women absolutely have it worse, but it's not like every man is out there trying to get them. What I see is just complaining but not doing anything about it. Instead of singling out actual predators and creeps and making an example out of them, we generalize and make it too big of a problem so that we feel helpless. It's like a woman can't have peace ever in her life, and even if that were true, it certainly isn't the mindset a woman should have in facing systematic oppression.",

( Counting trans men it would be seven ) This includes a guy who said hi to me a few times and held the door open for me. So no, I don't have high standards. Pretty sure one of them had two girlfriends.  ( Nice to me not to thee. ) And one of those girlfriends was always shooting me dirty looks so maybe she at least thought he was trying to get with me. One I sit with awkwardly in class and he doesn't insult me and has said hi to me a few times so I count him. There are some more men but they said such awful things about our teachers I won't even add them to the count. \n\nI live in a blue state. \n\nPlease don't blame me when I'm a little more unsure of men than women as my number for women past middle school being nicer would be much larger. My number for men hurting me vs women hurting me would be much larger as well. Maybe when I get past highschool this prejudice won't be as needed but school boys at least are majority awful from what I've seen, met, heard, realized. \n\nGroup of boys in my middle would talk about gang b/nging the teachers women or man. Two/three harassed me. My p.e teacher assaulted me and the guys who harassed me called me a liar when I came out about it. Changed middle schools. The first day a guy came up to me, told me to look to my side, then grabbed my face and turned it towards him then walked away. \n\nI've been asked 'What color is it? is it pink?' 'Want to get with my friend?' ( I was having a breakdown about whether or not I want to go back into a mental hospital, didn't know those guys, they asked it will walking past, not the goddamn time. ) 'Hey my friend likes you!' yeah thanks I know that it should be considered an insult to have any feelings or care for me! \n\n'Yeah [ my name ] is my girlfriend.' I am not. Was not. Never will be. 'Hey what do you think about my friend?' 'Hes weird I don't know him and he keeps calling me his girlfriend.' I felt bad for being too harsh in front of everyone.  *the guy kept calling me his girlfriend after that so I guess not harsh enough though.* \n\nI don't think I have that heavy of a prejudice when I'm actually faced towards a guy in person, unfortunately.\n But please don't blame other girls/women for having one it would probably benefit me greatly if I did and girls/women don't owe men/boys compliance and to be gentle and polite and considerate when treated with the opposite behavior repeatedly. \n\nI've been whistled at in the halls or during p.e. Called a 'mommy' by a stranger. \n\nThe prejudice I do have is fear based on being treated like I have been again. Which I most surely will be treated like again.",

I'm sorry that happened to you and I know worse, ones that even weren't safe from their own family. When faced with a guy you shouldn't allow them to take advantage of you and it's within reason to be protective of yourself but to a point. Trauma plays its hand in this. I can't fault you for a hostile response to assault, and to be protective of yourself. However, your experience doesn't allow you to hurt other people just because you yourself were traumatized.\n\nIf you want to fix the system you'd want to isolate such behavior in order for the generation to stop doing it. If you generalize it, you portray it as innate within people. So is your goal for men to start believing that they are born predators or that there are more factors that cause a lot of them to be creeps and predators? and also the fact that it isn't exclusive to them because in that case you also negate the experiences of many men who were assaulted by women or other men.\n\nThe fact is that what happens to you isn't the cause of some systematic war on your gender but is rather motivated by selfish sexual desires that aren't taken seriously by the men doing them either. The more we generalize and isolate ourselves from the rest, the more we become alone.\n\nIs it better to hope that the person in front of you is a human being and still be protective of yourself or accept defeat and that men are just inherently evil and you are destined to face assault in a world run by them?",

Every girl that watched that video was scared it would be a man. Luckily it was just a bear chilling and everyone was relieved.\nNot all men are evil, but women are still careful and constantly think of new ways to stay safe even though THEY'RE the victims and instead you should just give the men schooling to be less evil toward women (look at the statistics of femicides). Remember that case about that one french lady? All the 50 convicted were men.\n\nLike I said, it's not that all men are evil, it's just that women are getting more and more scared of men because there's just such a large quantity of them that are absolutely evil. It's just that us other men don't know about this until we talk about this topic with a female friend.\n\nI strongly advise you watch this video if you know German, want to be mature about things and ACTUALLY want to understand this topic. Feel free to ignore and think of me as a hateful idiot if you don't care about the safety of women, you're free to do that too, of course.\n\n[Very informative Video](https://youtu.be/Di17YGKrhO8?si=NUG7lwYtZZg1o27m)",

Many women take precautions when going out, and their fears are understandable. The reality is that women do face risks, especially from intimate partners or family members\u2014which is where most gender-based violence occurs. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 64% of female homicide victims in 2021 were killed by an intimate partner or family member, not a stranger. This means that while public safety is important, the real focus should be on addressing violence as a whole\u2014not just assuming all men are a threat.\n\nNow, let's talk about the idea that \"men need to be educated to be less evil.\" Education is important, but crime is not just a morality issue\u2014it\u2019s a societal one. Violent behavior is driven by multiple factors, including mental health, childhood trauma, and socioeconomic conditions. Simply saying \"teach men not to be violent\" ignores the deeper causes of crime and the fact that violence affects both men and women.\n\nIn fact, if we look at global crime statistics from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), 81% of all homicide victims are men, and 90% of all perpetrators are men. This doesn\u2019t mean \"men are dangerous\"\u2014it means violence is a complex issue that disproportionately affects men too. That\u2019s why focusing on crime prevention, mental health resources, and early intervention is far more productive than simply blaming an entire gender.\n\nAs for the statement about \"50 convicted being men\" in a particular French case, that is anecdotal evidence, not statistical proof of a trend. If we were to cherry-pick cases where women committed violent crimes (such as child abuse cases, where women are often the majority of perpetrators), would it be fair to say \"women are dangerous\"? No, because crime needs to be understood in context\u2014not used to make sweeping generalizations.",

I, personally, have been molested several times at school by guys I thought were my friends and weren\u2019t able to trust the adults around me so I have to protect myself any way I know how. I\u2019ve also had situations where guys would bump into me to get a feel of my breasts with their arms or chest (same with frontal hugs.) had a guy during gym \u201caccidentally\u201d slap my boob with the back of his hand. Sexual assault on women and girls or sexualization on the female body is more common than men realize. It\u2019s absolutely not all men!! And I will never say it is, but unfortunately it\u2019s most girls and women who\u2019ve had situations like these. We don\u2019t mean to be rude but we need to have ways to protect ourselves since so many people won\u2019t protect us. And sometimes in some cases we HAVE to be rude so a guy will leave us alone. Keep in mind I just got stalked by a guy and I finally got him to stop (I hope) so this is a serious topic I\u2019m speaking on. I hope this gives some insight! Good luck! (Also, for anyone who thinks it depends on what the girls wearing, it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s an exhibit dedicated to SA survivors and there were baby onesies, little girls night gowns and T-shirts and jeans, women\u2019s hoodies and sweatpants, diapers, and even a woman\u2019s wedding dress. Her husband and his friends raped her on her wedding night. There\u2019s even Muslim women who came forward saying they were raped in their place of worship, and in those places women must be covered head to toe. Men like that don\u2019t care what we\u2019re wearing, they only care that we have the parts they want.)",
