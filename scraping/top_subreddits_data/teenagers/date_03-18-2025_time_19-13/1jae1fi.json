    "selftext": "Hey r/teenagers \n\nOnly a small update, but just wanted to state that gallery posts are back, allowing you to post multiple images in the same post. We trialed having just one image in each post for more efficient moderation and reduce rule-breaking posts however under reflection of it, we've decided to re-enable them.\n\nWe hope that this change allows you to engage even more with the community!\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\\-Josh and the Reddit Team :)",
