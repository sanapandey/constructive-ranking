I feel like that doesn't happen with AFAB people as much. Because if a guy does anything people always assume it's a sex thing. Especially if it's usually associated with children. Which is so gross. Idk I can't really tell what it's like to be a woman. I wish I could switch between the sexes (I thought everyone thought that way when thought I was cis \ud83d\ude2d) so take everything with a grain of salt but it's some things I've noticed.",
