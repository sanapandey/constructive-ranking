Send out a ticket you can order from and go through the list, give everyone 20 minutes and don't even list them on the site till every legit user gets a chance to order.\n\nBut this mass buying, website crashes, panicked customers all encourages people to overpay to get one, it helps create more scarcity which lets them gouge more.\n\nI'd love amd/nvidia do to something similar like sell through steam. Older the account and more active the gamer, you get priority order, get it shipped, bots aren't going to get through that way, a bunch of new accounts aren't going to get priority, nor will older accounts with only free games with no hours played.\n\nso many ways to prevent scalping and help actual gamers get the cards.",

That example right there should say it all, and I guarantee you something similar is happening with the 50 series.

After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point.\"\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later](https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later)\n\n\"We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. We are not allowed to say exact prices ahead of the release, but simply put they will apply to a limited number of cards.\"\n\n\"The prices only apply to the first shipment of each model.\"\n\n\"We literally have around 2000 units from Sapphire in stock, 1000 from Powercolor and 1000 from Asrock, I feel stock will be fine for a few days. MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through.\u00a0\"\n\nThat sounds like lying, creating MSRP that only exist for limited amount of time and stock just to be increased by design almost instantly. They can claim they launched at 599$ for marketing/reviews, dosent matter that most wont be able to get it at that price BEFORE retailers and AIB markups, right?",

Anyone thinking of going into parenthood should understand this and shouldn't persue it if they can't meet the bare minimum requirements of feeding and housing them. Of course there's edge cases but should we as a society be held accountable for those few whom can't make good decisions? The alternative is just allow them to keep making the same mistake because 'it doesn't matter that I don't contribute, the state will feed my kids'.

Before that i was trying my hand at linux gaming.  \n\nIt is pretty exciting that linux gaming has come so far in the last 5 years. \n\nI've never purchased a launch day card before and am not looking forward to the install process for linux. \n\nWere  you able to get the card up and running?

So just waiting 1 month and i think you should easily get a card close to MSRP. Seeing as 9070 non xt are more in stock there will most likely be a price drop for them later on.\n\nOr maybe wait slightly longer still as most likely nvidia will start having stock and lower price. Which will probably force AMD to go that 50 lower again.\n\nThere are no 50 series in stock at all. But 9070 different variants are still in stock.(of course differs from country to country). But if all 9070s were being sold out i would be more worried. But i am 100% certain that waiting 1-2 months and we will get great deals on 9070s.",

AMD has to meet their requirements for games consoles, Nvidia is making bank on chips for AI. They are both over time being hoovered up by Crypto mining. I'm sure they both have a lot more going on too. Not sure if AMD's CPU division is competing for resources too or if that's a different type of production.\n\nBut yeah it's already a limited resource between companies, then it's a limited resource within the companies themselves. There just isn't enough fabrication available globally right now and those things can take a decade+ to get up and running and everyone has been caught with their pants down. Shocking that Europe and the US seemingly left this market to Asia for so long when it was clear how important globally it's continuing to be. \n\nBut yeah that said, as a consumer, its hard to feel like they are not doing this shit on purpose lol.

I was rewarded with what most of us are experiencing now.\n\nIt finally dawned on me, that, two years after release, they do not discount any prior generation cards by a penny. Not even if you buy them used from Ebay. There are no deals to be had. People are asking for MSRP from 2-4 years ago for most used cards I've seen listed for months. It's absurd.\n\nI hate to say, but the only actual opportunities on the market since I decided it was...time....are probably the brief window of availability for the GRE and the B580 before they were pulled and never reappeared.\n\nI guess you can point to the disgusting crypto craze leading into silicon shortages during the pandemic, and finally the AI bonanza that is still ongoing and has pumped up NVIDIA valuations to absurd degrees. Gamers, in their desperation, sought any deal they could find until there were no deals to be had, and the prices settled into their new territory.\n\nHoping this kit will last me another 5+ years or until I give in again. I don't want anything to do with this shit. I really hope that APU SOCs take off like they did in the console market, because videocards are unsustainable to the point of being ridiculous at this point. They're twice the size of a Steam Deck on the low end, and they cost double to triple to quadruple what they used to. AMD has the right idea with trying to move to SOCs and APUs, I hate to say, upgrades be damned. Being able to upgrade a PC isn't an advantage any more, it's a curse.",

Games like Space Marine 2 were taking up more than what it was comfortable giving, and some of the newer games I was interested in finally started to push my 1080 out of the way. Doesn't help I was a bit CPU bottlenecked either. \n\nBut with games like Space Marine 2 chugging, wantign a smoother experience in games like Frostpunk 2, and wanting to make sure I can play games like the Resident Evil remakes and Monster Hunter Wilds it was just time to upgrade. And then when I wanted to upgrade all the worthwhile GPUs to upgrade to on the Nvidia side were at or above $1000 lol. I could have gone cheap and stayed in 1080p land but it seemed like a good time to make the jump to a 1440p capable machine, and AMD just made the more affordable card.",

When I saw AMD announcement I knew this was going to happen. If non-XT is worth 3000, you can easily charge 3500 or more for XT.

Extremely shady. \n\n[https://www.techspot.com/review/2961-amd-radeon-9070-xt/](https://www.techspot.com/review/2961-amd-radeon-9070-xt/)\n\n\"Finally, we have some concerns about how \"real\" the $600 MSRP actually is. After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point.\"\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later](https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later)\n\n\"We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. We are not allowed to say exact prices ahead of the release, but simply put they will apply to a limited number of cards.\"\n\n\"The prices only apply to the first shipment of each model.\"\n\n\"We literally have around 2000 units from Sapphire in stock, 1000 from Powercolor and 1000 from Asrock, I feel stock will be fine for a few days. MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through.\u00a0\"",

It's not even one of the 330+W cards that can be overclocked which is a slap in the face for their highest tier card. Same 303w rdp as any MSRP card. The only difference is better cooling with one extra heat pipe over the hellhound and a 12+1 mofset compared to your 10+1. I figured for $40 more might as well get the best. Need to see if it even fits in my case. I have a EVGA FTW3 ftw ultra 3090 in their now so hopefully.

They said it was due to \"insufficient supply,\" which presumably meant that their inventory tracking system was just unable to remain synchronized with their purchase processing system when faced with a surge of transactions.\n\nI kind of find it hard to believe that I actually scored some in-demand tech on release day after striking out on the 30 series, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 Ti. I don't think it will feel real until the card is in my hands.\n\nThere were a number of other cards I might have been able to select from, but I  had already set a personal ceiling of $750 on principle, which excluded a depressingly large variety of options. And that's with the $50 rebate that AMD is reportedly handing out to vendors. I didn't see a single MSRP card actually available to purchase online. Apparently Microcenter got them all, and the closest one to me is a full day's drive.",

AMD deserve the hate for that, not retailers.  \n\nOverclockers said this would happen on their [forum](https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/threads/ocuk-guide-to-ordering-your-amd-9070-graphics-card-today-at-14-00.18999857/) about how to go about buying these cards (and the things they've done to combat bots and scalpers, see: not enough). Only 900 units were available at MSRP across 9070 and 9070XT, and now those are gone, they've put the prices up to what they likely bought the cards for, from AMD. This isn't retailer greed, it's retailers catching shade for AMDs disgustingly shady marketing bullshit. \n\nAnd through all that, arguably, the cards are still underpriced, because hundreds of them are already on ebay being scalped for hundreds over the current overclockers asking price, double \"MSRP\" in some cases.\n\nI get people want MSRP cards, but in the current market, it looks like keeping the prices at MSRP would do nothing but put more money in the pockets of scalpers -- because **people are still buying at these insane second hand prices**. You want to be angry at someone, be angry at AMD for fucking consumers by lying about prices, and be angry at idiot buyers [agreeing to pay \u00a3900 for cards someone else bought for \u00a3570 four hours ago](https://i.imgur.com/wa6op6J.png) - they are who is enabling this bullshit.",

            "body": "Placed an order at Amazon for the Gigabyte 9070 XT Gaming OC within a few minutes of the global launch yesterday. Package shipped around 11:30 PM and arrived at its destination at about 11 AM today. I installed the card, and it's running cool and quiet so far. Haven't run any benchmarks yet. I plan on undervolting a little, since it's not the most efficient GPU.\n\nI relied on the InStock mobile app to index Amazon's product pages for the launch, since Amazon was not making them regularly discoverable prior to 6 AM. I think I was able to purchase the card only because Amazon's search tool was still working on its own indexing at the time, as were the other tracker apps.\n\nYou can also set up this app to automatically purchase a video card at Amazon with a price ceiling that you provide, but it doesn't appear to let you select specific models. It will just buy whatever 9070 or 9070 XT has become available at that moment, as long as it's at or below the max price that you've selected.\n\nThis feature was previously working with Newegg too, but Newegg has begun adding a captcha that interferes with the process.\n\nEither way, be aware that you will still be competing with other trackers that are now fully configured, so even a tracker with automatic purchasing is not guaranteed to work. The RDNA4 cards are in the same arms race as the RTX 50 series, where they will trickle out in fits and starts and get intercepted by a bot API within seconds.\n\nI also placed an order with Newegg yesterday morning as a backup, for the ASUS Prime 9070 XT, but they canceled my order within about an hour of placing it, citing insufficient supply. I wouldn't trust them to honor a transaction for one of these cards until the shipment has actually been sent.\n\nLastly, you will need [the new Adrenaline 25.3.1 drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/downloads/drivers.html/graphics/radeon-rx/radeon-rx-9000-series/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt.html) to get full Windows compatibility. The previous drivers will only give you basic functionality. This is probably obvious to most people, but it's worth mentioning, IMO.\n\nUpdate: I played around a bit in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, where I have been using the optimized settings [from this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8TEZJGBtnk). With my 6900 XT and 9800X3D with 48GB of 6000MHz CL30 DDR5, I ranged around 75-100 fps at 1440p. With the 9070 XT, I now frequently hit the 165 Hz refresh rate ceiling of my monitor. So I don't even know what the true average fps would be. I am pleased with this purchase.\n\nThough now it seems that I should investigate another monitor upgrade...",

While reducing power consumption to around 280W. That leads to a non-trivial increase in frame rate while also reducing GPU temperatures by several degrees C and fan speeds by several hundred RPM.\n\nThe tradeoff is a slightly higher chance of instability. But the benefits greatly outweigh the risks, so tweaking voltage and power limits is generally regarded as [the first thing that everyone should try with a new card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPR06CxysMw).",

That ASUS card is $719.99 at Newegg, as well. What that suggests is that that's ASUS' MSRP for the card.\n\nA lot of people seem to be under the impression that the MSRP of the XT is $599, but MSRP is set by the manufacturer (that's the 'M'), which is the AIBs that put the cards together, and each of their models has a different MSRP. For example, the ASUS Prime has one MSRP and the ASUS TUF Gaming has a different, higher one. When the Prime was $599, it was being sold for $120 **under** MSRP because AMD was subsidizing it. That has now ended and retailers have to sell the cards at their MSRPs or else lose money. I've read that retailers make something like only $25 profit per card, so they must be buying the Prime for nearly $700. Unless they get rebates, they obviously can't keep selling it for $599. I'm sure that they hate having to increase the price, but they don't have a choice. We should put the blame on AMD for selling the chips to AIBs at a price that forced AIBs and then retailers to price these cards higher than we would like.",

After camping the site for a while, I settled for less and got my hands on the ASUS prime 9070. I was disappointed, but I still got a decent card out of it so I accepted my lot. \n\n2 days later when my ASUS prime 9070 arrives, I open the box to find that Newegg has NOT sent me the regular 9070 but has accidentally sent me an ASUS prime 9070 XT!\n\nThis was my first ever gpu launch. I thought it went horribly at first, but I guess everything worked out in the end :)",

When it's finally up, all the stuff I wanted (that was put at MSRP) was sold out. Few hours later, suddenly they've got stuck! And instead of 695 euros, it's now 899. \n\nI swear, these webshops never even intended to sell at MSRP and just pretended to sell it for that price for a while. I've wanted to upgrade for a while now, my 6700 XT is okay, but on so many games nowadays it's a struggle to play on high settings at 2k. But all the other hardware I have is fine and I would only need to upgrade my GPU to make things a bit nicer. \n\nI'll just play the new stuff on PS5 Pro for now. People laugh at the console, but I feel like getting that over just a GPU for the same price was better value. It was the perfect card for my upgrade as well, before I need a better PSU or CPU. Like at this point, if I stick with my 6700 XT for now and wait for a new gen, I might just go for a high range card. But at that point I'll have to upgrade other parts too. Sigh.",

And even then I don\u2019t think that will be enough to solve the issue. The only real long term solution I can think of is entirely cutting out third party board partners and moving to a first party model. At least then people could order the cards with an estimated ship time like when Apple drops new products, because NVIDIA/AMD would know when the parts are going to be in stock again and how many people are queued to get a part.",

After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point.\"\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later](https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later)\n\n\"We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. We are not allowed to say exact prices ahead of the release, but simply put they will apply to a limited number of cards.\"\n\n\"The prices only apply to the first shipment of each model.\"\n\n\"We literally have around 2000 units from Sapphire in stock, 1000 from Powercolor and 1000 from Asrock, I feel stock will be fine for a few days. MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through.\u00a0\"\n\nThat sounds like lying, creating MSRP that only exist for limited amount of time and stock just to be increased by design almost instantly. They can claim they launched at 599$ for marketing/reviews, dosent matter that most wont be able to get it at that price BEFORE retailers and AIB markups, right?  \nBasically 599$ MSRP is unprofitable and fake, AMD taking loss/reducing profits so they can claim it and get better reviews yesterday.",

What CPU, eg 14900K draws almost 300W, maybe a bunch of hard drives and/or high speed network cards, those draw a bunch of power too)\n\nSo they assume fairly high power draw for the rest of your components\n\n2. Efficiency, PSU efficiency is non linear, it tends to peak somewhere around 50% load and drops off on both ends of the spectrum\n\nEg. your PSU is 80+ gold rated, it has to be 90% efficient at 50% but only 87% at 100% load\n\nThis leads to more heat and greater noise from the PSU fan(to deal with the more heat)",

It\u2019s a nice card and it\u2019s self-boosting to over 3200 MHz which is well above the advertised speed of 3010 MHz so I\u2019m very pleased with it. And it\u2019s remaining pretty cool in the process. The fans are nice and quiet. \n\nIt\u2019s a massive upgrade from my 2070 Super - it\u2019s so nice to be able to crank the detail up on cyberpunk and turn on all the ray tracing etc and still have playable framerates. \nI had it running at psycho ray tracing with path tracing enabled and using FSR 3.1 with frame gen it was running above 130 fps. \nI mean, it looked like crap (because FSR 3.1) but once they enable FSR 4 in that game it\u2019ll be awesome. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mess around ordering and cancelling etc. If you can place a preorder just do it.

I\u2019m finally getting to see ray tracing and it reminds me of being a little kid and seeing the jump from ps1 to ps2 or something. The new tech is really cool. So hopefully they get some more cards sent out so the people that actually want them and not to make a quick buck can enjoy them. If you can get msrp, I think these are definitely worth the wait. I was an nvidia guy, had heard bad things about amd back in the day but can honestly say I\u2019ve been nothing but pleased with the whole experience and with prices being as crazy as they are, would be perfectly content sticking with amd if they continue to be the \u201cbang for your buck\u201d type underdogs they seem to currently be",

This would have really sucked, but fortunately for me, I needed another PSU for another build I'm selling, so this worked out. But I swear Newegg had the GPU listed by itself a day before for 599.99, and then when they attached it to the bundle, it went up a hundred bucks, Whack.",

Even NVidia cards that have been in stock all week are gone. It's like a FOMO fuelled buying frenzy across the whole inventory. \n\nMeanwhile you check ebay and there's literally hundreds of cards already up at a scalpers premium, with stock photos, because of course, these parasites haven't even recieved their cards before they're reselling them. \n\nIf there's any lesson manufacturers are going to take from all this, it's that these predatory marketing tactics really do work. Artificial scarcity and FOMO will clear your inventory. \n\nIf there's anything retailers are going to take from all this, it's that selling as high as you can is the smart move, because either you get the profit, or some fucking scalper will, while adding no value at all. \n\nIf there's anything consumers are going to take from this, it's absolutely nothing, consumers are powerless, because a particular subset with no class consciousness are clearly going to keep buying scalped products - case in point, you can go to ebay, search 9070xt and sort by sold items and already see the proof.\n\nIt's a disgusting situation all round, the prices are fake, the scarcity is fake, and the demand is fake. The amount of people clearly not planning to use these cards as anything but a quick cash grab is gross, but it's working for them, because there's just enough real demand to keep up the illusion and fuel the FOMO.",

SO your model should perform slightly better than the one Jay reviewed. Plus drivers probably improve that a bit over time too as they mature, if AMD history is anything to go by.\n\nI really wish manufactures would make cleaner distinctions in their naming conventions, as many people buying the XFX mercury will assume it's the OC model without looking at the specs page. for the 9070xt alone i think XFX have at least four variants.\n\nHappy gaming!",

At higher load it still works, but occasional spikes or instability might occur.\n\nAlso take into consideration that this total GPU power usage is not fixed. You can start games at lower settings and work your way up to higher ones and see what stress your GPU is under. Trial and error.",

            "body": "# Pro tip for new buyers/owners.\n\nBefore installing the drivers for your new card, you should make sure that any integrated GPU in your processor is disabled from the UEFI/BIOS, or your Adrenalin Software suite will permanently lock out the options for recording and streaming from it. The only way to get them back is to use AMD's driver cleanup utility and then reinstall the whole package after the iGPU is disabled.\n\nBeware, that tool requires booting Windows into safe mode, and I've been warned Windows 11 still has a bug that if you use a PIN code for your account and boot into safe mode it can randomly lock your account permanently. It didn't happen to me, but it's something Microsoft are not prioritizing a fix for.\n\nHere is where I found the option to disable the iGPU on my X870E Taichi, but it will be different for other motherboards. Don't disabled it from Windows, because if you need it for troubleshooting it won't be there. If you use this option it will be enabled when a card is not detected.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OUrnmc4.jpeg",

I think the nitro+ was the only one sold out. 25+ remaining of 5 models, 10-20 of the rest basically.  \n\n**Noon Central:**\n\n* 5 $600/MSRP  \n* 1-24 of various other cards  \n* 25+ hellhound and red devil\n\nVery curious if they\u2019ll last the day, and veeeery curious what open box deals there might be. Lots of buyers had returns. I snagged an XT a couple hours ago, but there will be some decent OB deals for people when these are sold out at least.\n\n**1330 Central:** \n\n* 1 $600/MSRP remaining (xfx swift)  \n* 44 $750-800 remaining (hellhound, red devil, tuf)  \n* 11 $800-850 remaining (white merc, red devil LE which I don't understand the point of this card)  \n\nIt appears they will not last the day. Didn't think they would, but was curious if they'd even make it to then of the 'work day' / 5pm. I'm curious how long it usually takes MC to list OB items.  \n\nThe 9070 base numbers have dropped very slightly, but still ~80 of those remaining  \n\nThey also have an XFX RX 580 GTS XXX 8GB new in stock, which is kinda wild? $145 lol  \n\n**1545 Central:**  \n\n* 0 $600/MSRP  \n* 12 $750-800 (red devil, tuf)  \n* 9 $800-850 (white merc, red devil LE)  \n\nLooks like the line ended at some point, now just people showing up as 'normal'  \n\nSurprised those red devil LEs are selling at $850 vs the regular red devil at $790",

I'm in a telegram group that basically uses bots to notify consumers about availability. Only way to beat scalpers is to use bots unfortunately. Also, i used an auto refresh extension for chrome that refreshed automatically and notified me as soon as the card was available. Otherwise you have to manually refresh and wait for a loooong time. I thought about reselling it on ebay for 900\u20ac and maybe buying a 9070 instead but i think i'll just keep it. I should be able to sell it used in a year or two for the same price. Bad availability of msrp cards was predictable though. Obviously retailers want to maximize profits as they don't care about reputation gains or market share. Supply and demand is the name of the game. I'd say for those who can't get a 9070XT at msrp, look out for a used 7900 XTX in the next couple of months. They should drop in price with supply increase.",

What do we have IDs/Drivers Licenses/SSNs for if we can't use any of them to verify being an actual person, and enforcing the whole \"Limit 1 per Customer\" thing?\n\nScalpers do not have to be as big of an issue as they are. Sellers could have a way to verify real human purchases via Identification of some sort, then have a program that detects when sales start slowing down because everybody who actually wants one has gotten one, THEN open up sales without identification. Which would also dissuade scalpers from scalping, because they'd have less people to sell to. Just the ones that are rich enough to afford it who didn't try to get whatever they want right at launch.",

I paid $850 for my 3080 which I will be upgrading from. Which I can then sell for \\~$400. \n\nDid I let the fomo get the best of me? I don't have a Microcenter so getting the MSRP prices will be virtually impossible. But I think if spend enough time trying I could likely get one of the $720-780 cards. But that's not a huge difference.",

They also stockpiled stock for 3 months, so the fact it's mostly sold out speaks to all of this.\n\nThis is the finally the time the 6800XT is really gonna out pull the 3080 now.

The XT is already inefficient so even more TDP on top of that. \n\nAnd the cost doesn't line up. These are being produced in a factory and cost you more than the sum of the parts if you got a base model and upgraded it's cooling system yourself+OC'd yourself. For the amount of added cost these things should be coming water-blocked lol. Yes I understand it's not quite as basic as what you'd do yourself but it's also not as advanced as an extra 200 over MSRP.

If you're already spending 800+ for a card, a lot of people will bite the bullet and spend 1-200 more for the perceived reliability and performance uplift from NVIDIA. Also better cooling options and OC means higher TDP which the XT is *already* an inefficient card and in the non-xt the efficiency is one of the main selling points (of the few it has in comparison to the XT, they're priced so close together most of the buyers of 9070's will be grabbing it as a consolation prize for not being able to get an XT, which is a horrible feeling to have with a brand new GPU).\n\nMy stance is only the stock/MSRP cards are worth a buy, I don't see the board partners upgrades as being worth the cost at all and I'm not even sure all of them *have* an MSRP model they're selling, which is BS.",

But they to have most models suffer from not so great price tags!\n\nIf this is a trend across EU and beyond, and doesn't settle down at some point, and there will be an ACTUALL good amount in stock, this i think will hurt AMD's attempt at gaining marked share from Nvidia!",

I don't want new monitors so I don't want 4K. I have never cared about raytracing, and I'm not interested in supporting games that force it either.\n\nThere are a number of games where I wish the single monitor framerate was higher (like Fallout 76, Marvel Rivals, Satisfactory(get between 65 and 90FPS on all of these games)).\n\nI'm also concerned that they'll finally get GPU chiplets working next gen (assuming TSMC still exists at that point), which I actually consider a bad thing since I've been burned into being a beta tester on first-gen AMD products before (Ryzen 1xxx and Vega GPU).\n\nSo again, does it make any sense?",

There is no much room to go down, but the price for chip design is rising constantly. To make 9070 chip, AMD has to invest between half a billion dollars and a billion dollars. That's a huge amount of money to create a new chip, gamers altogether (of the entire planet) will have to pay it for years to make AMD go into profitable territory. So, what they are going to do? Fabricate more of the same (Navi 48) and keep selling it. Eventually prices will be dropping just because new designs will cost a lot more, while old design will be much cheaper because they were already created and you just need to launch another lot of semiconductor fabrication (which costs a fraction of designing a new chip). If the same chip is sold year after year , the only strategy to compete what is left is: price drop. That's why GPU prices will be dropping. My expectation is that in 3 years 9070 will be at 300 bucks. I don't think they are going to make something with 3 nanometer process in 3 years because that will cost a lot. Such chip can only be paid by AI, but not gaming. The end of law of Moore is kinda serious thing, they can't make gaming GPU larger because it will consume more power, the only way to keep it under 300W is to decrease the fabircation process by dropping it from 4nm to 3nm. But it is a lot more expensive.  \nAbout devaluing dollar, yeah , this is also very likely, and if it happens, the 9070 will just stay between 500 and 600 bucks.",

GTA 5 enhanced with max graphics and ray tracing and got quite a smooth 60+fps while playing. Huge improvement over my 3060ti, which would lag a little bit on gta 5 even without ray tracing. The 9070 made gta 5 a much more enjoyable and smooth experience. My 3060ti would struggle a lot on marvel rivals, even on low settings during fights, I\u2019d get noticeable frame drops below 60fps. The 9070 is allowing me to play on medium/high graphics and getting me 100+fps during fights with minimal drops. It made marvel rivals a much more enjoyable game.\n\nMy 3d mark score on Steel Nomad more than doubled from a score of 2500, to 5800.
