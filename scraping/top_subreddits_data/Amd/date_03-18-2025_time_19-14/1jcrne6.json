Fair question, I bought it roughly 2 months before the 9070XT\u2019s release as I read they weren\u2019t gonna release a high end GPU and also honestly because of impatience. However now I see the huge price spike as well as the huge shortage where I\u2019m from I think this is the better purchase now.",
