Everyone is fighting for the same die space and one use case has 10-30x the retail value as the others.",

I didnt even know such things can be done via bios now a days.\n\nI had so many things setup that a fresh install would have been a bigger pain at that point.\n\nTheir software was resource hungry. I always have as de-bloated OS setup as i can and even then you could see it was always doing something in background that would affect memory/CPU to the extent it would zap some performance. The worst thing was how sluggish the PC was at startup.\n\nIn some games like Forza and such that were far more GPU heavy it didnt affect too much. But things like Counter-Strike would have a bigger effect. I dont remember what FPS difference and such there was. But stutters were common, the worst thing is if i turned stuff off in task manager that is related to ASUS it would have some things auto-restart after a small period.\n\nI know people use their software and they probably improved many things. But i am also sure that often when people have issues with games like Counter-Strike they will have such programs in background causing issues. MSI afterburner used to cause issues in some games as well, although if i remember correctly that was to do with earliest Ryzen CPUs and memory dumping issues.\n\nIts not the first time hardware manufacturers software causes issues for me. Logitech would make your mouse go all weird when it needed an update. Luckily they have on board memory so you can get rid of their software entirely.",

A 5nm wafer from tsmc is approx 16k usd. 5090 die size is about 40 per wafer, but a wafer isn't 100% viable. For high end chips it hovers around 50% usable silicon per wafer. So that's 16k for approx 20 5090 chips in just silicon alone for nvidia. Thats nearly $800 per gpu right there.\n\nCompare that to the 1080ti built on the 16nm node. Those wafers were approx 4k each. That's a 4x increase in cost in the wafer alone.\n\nSo nvidia then has to manufactere the gpu off of it, then add on margins to make money, probably not small margins either. So then the AIB needs to design and R&D their card including the PCB. Then they have to buy everything needed to make the card then pay to manufactere it.\n\nKeep in mind EVGA dipped from the market after 30 series citing the margins were dogshit and it wasn't worth the effort. The 30 series stuff was basically just as expensive as 40 series.",

Over 90% of NVIDIA's revenue is now selling chips to datacenters. Corporations pay ten times more than consumers per square mm2. As a result neither AMD nor NVIDIA have an incentive to meet consumer demand, because it's basically just throwing away money. Why sell silicon to consumers for under $1000 when a datacenter is willing to spend ten times that amount per mm2.\n\nMost people including here seem to be completely unaware of just how insane the AI boom has been in the last year. NVIDIA especially, but also AMD to a great extent. NVIDIA's revenue has shifted to such an extreme over the last few quarters that the gaming segment is now below 10% of revenue (I believe it's around 7% now). At this rate gamers will become margin of error. Everything is going straight to the datacenters. Millions of GPU's at a time being ordered by Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla/X and basically every other tech corporation riding the AI hype train. \n\nAnd don't forget those datacenters GPU's are absolutely huge, which compounds the issue. They eat up all the available wafers, leaving nothing for game-related GPU's. That's why the RTX 5090 doesn't exist for example, nor will it ever (unless the AI hype dies down, which isn't happening either).",

If buyers don't pay and sales slump the company will be forced to drop their prices.\n\nI don't get why people blame the company and not the buyers. Writing was on the wall when people were spending 2x-3x msrp on GPUs during the covid/crypto boom. Manufacterers saw that and were asking themselves why are we settling for trash profit margins. Trash margins at and around MSRP are why EVGA dipped out of the market.\n\nThe sad part is this will look cheap in 5 years. Remember when people were hating on the 4090 for $1600? Pc gamers would be cheered on reddit for scooping a 4090 at retail today. We have endless posts of people showing their 2k+ 5090, gloating about getting one at retail. Give it 5 years and that 2k msrp for a 90 will be remembered as better days.",

I think manufacturers are artificially creating more demand (the fact that both RDNA4 and nvidia 4xxx stopped being manufactured fully months before even the announcements for new GPUs says it all). Why? Selling more cards in this case for around MSRP will lead to less profits as the prices right now are jacked way too much (+ you don't pay the cost to manufacture another GPU and ship it). Also for future profits it's good as the customers will get used to higher prices.\n\nAnyway, I am not saying something ground breaking here, it's obv that manufacturers love the current situation and prices will go even higher. Same story about supply/demand and the scalpers... you have X number of Y, you just need X people to buy on the announced price to sell all your stock. Ofc as seller/business you will sell at the maximum price to have X customers matching your X stock. It's how it works and always was.",

            "body": "At this point I don't even know why news like this matters anymore. I wouldn't be shocked if one day they literally double the MSRP. The main problem is that people still buy them and they keep selling out. These higher prices will once again normalize and become the standard because everyone keep purchasing overpriced products.\n\nIt's scummy that the manufacturers/retailers do this but it's the customers who support this behavior. It's no different than buying from a scalper at this rate and it's sad that a lot of people don't see that because they bought it at a store. Here on Reddit we know better but we're also just a tiny percentage of the general population. Watch these products continue to sell out.\n\nObviously, I hope I'm wrong and these GPU's remain on store shelves until they're forced to come down in price.\n\n/rant",
