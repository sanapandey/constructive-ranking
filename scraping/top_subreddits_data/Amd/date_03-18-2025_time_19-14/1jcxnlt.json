Air will always try to go up. \n\nIs the same reason why vehicles have coolant expansion tanks. If pcs had coolant expansion tanks you could add much more water without the worry of air in the pump, because the air would be in the expansion reservoir. I believe that\u2019s the idea behind closed loop systems.",
