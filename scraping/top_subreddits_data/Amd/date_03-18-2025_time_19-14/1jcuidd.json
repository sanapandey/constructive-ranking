Maybe if you work at TSMC or AMD you'll have detailed knowledge of this, and perhaps you aren't supposed to talk about it then.\n\nBut it is easy to see that the degradation process is natural, so it occurs for all CPUs under use. So if you want proof, you'll have to wait and see when they start dying en masse, for a given manufacturing process. We can pretty much expect that there is a bunch of overclockers who have been running Scalar 10x since day 1, though they may just resell the CPUs as used within a year or 2 (or kill the CPU outside of the scope of the boost, with a static OC for example), so not necessarily a good source of data.\n\nNow, while I don't expect Scalar to kill CPUs in months or anything, especially if they are not under constant load, what we know is that the engineers bothered to consider the whole degradation thing when designing the boost system. So in a very simple way, if the designers of the CPU are a bit worried, then maybe we should be as well. It's not like we are upping the tjmax from 95C to something higher either, even though there is obviously a safety buffer there as well.",
