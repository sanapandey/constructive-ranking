You must be 18 or older to enter. You must also be prepared to provide real name, address, etc for shipping purposes.\n\nAlso, TWO of these winners will be randomly selected to receive a card that's signed by Lisa Su, CEO of AMD...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/neaw0snphipe1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ed99cc9d92802256a75aab2a186ba9f4d9d1a8\n\nSo, if you're eligible and want a chance to win, give it a shot!",
