That's not how you get help.\n\nBut, I will clue you in because I have a 5700xt, and just did a tune up last month. Junction/hotspot hitting 110c is fine. You won't burn up your card, I've lived with that for a long time. It will throttle your card. Depending on your model, you can get new thermal pads and repaste it.\n\nI repasted mine with NH2, and used gelid extreme 15w pads. That alone dropped my temps, but then I undervolted down to 1132mv @ 2100mhz. Raised the power limit to +50%. It's stable as a rock, and in very intense games I'm hitting 98c hotspot while still clocking out near 2050mhz consistently.",

This is totally normal return policy. \n\n>This should be on XFX, which was the party who screwed up, not the retailer.\n\nAgain, probably no real infrastructure for it so they work with the retailers",

XFX has a good reputation, but maybe it does not extend outside the US whatsoever. \"you lost your opportunities to get other better cards, but go get a refund and nothing else\" is what you get in europe! I would've even gladly taken a direct purchase of 9070 xt mercury OC through XFX/NR (the european reseller) where I paid for the difference but didn't have to go through retailers where they add their own profit margins (and where I'd have to wait for the card to even be available!)",
