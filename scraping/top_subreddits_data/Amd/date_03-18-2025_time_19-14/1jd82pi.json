This means that you could basically trade resolution for refresh rate. If it could display 1024x768@60Hz with a 50KHz horizontal scan frequency, then it could run 800x600@75, or 640x480@95, or 320x200@230. \n\nOk, so there's also the vscan frequency in addition to hscan, so maybe not quite 230, but most CRTs would reach 120 with vscan typically being 48-160Hz.\n\nThe other factor is the RAMDAC on your video card which had to be fast enough to cover the total bandwidth required for the signal.",

End of the day its a good thing if there is competition at least in the middle where most people are going to spend money.",
