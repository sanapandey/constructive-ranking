Especially since AirPlay is widely known and easy to use.\n\n- Data transfer in iPhones is also rarely done nowadays. You have iCloud Drive and other services and syncing an iTunes list no longer a common use case in times of streaming.\n\n- Fast charging is also not the main benefit anymore. Current iPhones can charge 25W with Qi2 chargers and 45W with USB-C. But most people use cheaper chargers with 20W or 30W. The regular Apple power adapter only supports 30W. So the average user would not notice a difference if Apple would replace the USB-C cable with a MagSafe 2 puck (similar to the smaller puck on the Apple Watch).\n\nSurely there are people who rely on a couple of these features, but 80-90% of the customers would move on. Looks what happened to the audio jack. People were crying back then and the industry has moved on and somehow we survived.",

My laptop is 99.9% wireless however I did need a ethernet port (twice), when I bought my laptop I didn\u2019t use ethernet however it was useful.\n\nThis is actually a great example of my point. The removal of the serial port was decried by a small handful of people who considered it useful for their workflows. It was useless to most people, Apple removed it in favor of more useful things, and technology marched on. The serial port was useless to many people, but to some it was useful. That\u2019s subjective usefulness.\n\nSimilarly, the charging port is subjectively useless (ie, useless to me). I can benefit from all of its current functions wirelessly. At this point, it is a redundant port for my workflows.

They might remove the port on an iPhone a year earlier than the foldable launches just to shift the controversy away from their major launch (like they did with the headphone jack - it\u2019s the iPhone X that needed that space, not the iPhone 7, but they removed it on the iPhone 7 which they already knew would be an underwhelming iteration to get it out of the way).\u00a0\n\nIn general I suspect a lot of the purpose behind making a super thin iPhone is to start figuring out how to manufacture certain components at scale that will be needed for a really thin foldable. Mess up your yields on the iPhone 17 Air and it doesn\u2019t make much difference in the grand scheme of things. Mess up yields on your flagship new foldable and it could result in the entire category missing the opportunity to really take off. \u00a0",
