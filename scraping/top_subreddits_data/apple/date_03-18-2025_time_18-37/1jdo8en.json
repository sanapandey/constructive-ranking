            "body": "From the article: With the second beta of macOS 15.4 that was released earlier in March, Apple changed System Settings to hide how much local storage space Apple Intelligence takes up on a Mac.\n\nMaking the change led to accusations that Apple was trying to hide the size of \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c, and so with the fourth macOS 15.4 beta that came out today, Apple made \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c\u2019s storage requirements easy to find once again.\n\nTo see \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c storage space, you can go to System Settings > General > Storage and click the info button next to the macOS listing. That brings up a popup that shows the version of macOS installed and the storage space taken up by \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c and it\u2019s the same way that System Settings works in the current release version of macOS Sequoia, 15.3.2.\n\nIt is possible that the missing \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c storage feature in the earlier macOS 15.4 beta was a bug. Users who had System Integrity Protection (SIP) disabled were able to see the information without issue, and Apple appeared to have made the \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c storage assets unavailable to anyone with SIP enabled.",

Wouldn't surprise me if either Apple's reporting is jacked up or they're just hiding it.\n\n> It doesnt put the 14gb into ram, does it?\n\nThe largest model is only 4GB. There are multiple models.\n\n> Not that this matters, ram is there to be used\n\nRepeating this ad nauseam doesn't make it true. If someone has their web browser open consuming 4GB, WindowServer consuming 2GB, the rest of macOS consuming 4GB, and a VM consuming 2GB, they only have 2GB left for their editor, terminal, etc. \n\nSo no, it *does* matter. Your statement you're repeating is only true for file cache, which can be evicted at (basically) zero cost.",
