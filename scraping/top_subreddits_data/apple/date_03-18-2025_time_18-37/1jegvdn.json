If *the most profitable company in the world with over 2 billion active devices* is not a \"significant market power\" than the phrase has no meaning lol.\n\n> Apple lost its challenge at Germany's top civil court on Tuesday against its classification as a significant market power, a label which gives antitrust regulators more scope and flexibility to scrutinise its business practices.",

It won\u2019t prove anything like that; that remains your opinion. Anyway, this case isn\u2019t even about they.\n\n(Also, Signal would work exactly the same with or without ADP.)",

That means they *never know* what your files are.\n\nThe only reason this is a problem is Apple doesn't allow anyone to be a complete substitute for their iCloud service.\n\nThis danger only exists because Apple has, at their insistence, become a singular, centralized repository of everyone's backups in a manner they can unencrypt.",

Either way, we'll be fine. None of this will stop the people it is meant for, it'll just make life worse for the regular folk, that only wants to watch cat videos on TikTok and share memes.\n\nI have very mixed feeling about the EU right now, and I absolutely hate it. As stereotypical as it sounds, they really should stick to regulating cheese names and and stopping wine bootleggers.\n\nSacr\u00e9-fucking-bleu",
