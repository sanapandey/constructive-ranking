The lack of encryption meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a look-a-like phishing site to steal your login credentials. It was first discovered by security researchers at app developer Mysk.\n\nThe Verge neglects to mention that the app was using HTTP to open the password reset pages. The article makes it seem like no big deal because they only mention the HTTP requests for icons/logos rather than the actual issue.",

And has clients on each platform you want (windows, linux, mac, android, iOS) that all work with the same database.\n\nThen you can put the database wherever you want (Dropbox/Drive/etc, your home server) or use something like syncthing to synchronize them and that's it.\n\nIt's obviously more not as simple as cloud password manager, but it's not too bad either.\n\nIf you put a _very_ strong password on your database, and then create a free Drive/Dropbox/etc account with a different _very_ strong password, then it should be seamless. Just make sure to backup your database somewhere else as well. Just in case. \n\nYou can back it up very easily as well, if you have a any type of home server (NAS, Pi, etc), you can sync that cloud account to your home server, and then from there back it up to some _other_ free cloud server provider. And you would end up with 3 copies + the local cache on each of your devices. \n\nFrom there it can be more secure adding a keyfile, hardware keys, whatever you want.\n\nSo basically it can get from relatively simple to as complex as you want.
