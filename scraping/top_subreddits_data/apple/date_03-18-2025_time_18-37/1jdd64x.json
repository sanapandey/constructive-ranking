Suppose that Apple could have released an \"iPhone X\" in 2016 but pushed it back to 2017.\n\n1. The Home button design was already a bit dated in 2016\u20132017. Apple ended up another year behind Samsung and other companies.\n2. The iPhone X sold well despite its high price, so Apple lost a lot of expensive sales.\n3. Apple missed out on a year's worth of information about purchases and usage of an OLED iPhone, which they can use for future iPhones.\n\n>But again, why do that when you have easy marketing.\n\nYou keep saying \"marketing,\" but how often did Apple actually link the iPhone X to the 10th anniversary in its marketing? I doubt the general population really cares, and in fact, it's probably better to release the 10th anniversary iPhone in late *2016* instead of late 2017 so it's actually available for the entire anniversary year. (It's similar to how year number models often come out during the previous year.)",

It was a proof of concept more than anything.\n\nThat's like saying a brand new car manufacturer should only be compared to how things worked on the T model. No, that's irrelevant, that was a point in time long gone. The standards evolved and that's what it should be compared to. If it's their first iteration, then sure there will be some quirks and the product will evolve, but the standard is not the one from a decade ago.\n\nSo it made sense the software and hardware weren't mature. It was a completely new space. But that's not the current space anymore.\n\n> I'm very confident Apple's first foldable OS iteration will be much stronger than the paper thin attempts at hybridising a tablet layout was for the first Android foldable releases.\n\nYes, because they can use the experience gained by Android phones to know what the market likes/dislikes, and had a whole decade to think about the software. Sure.\n\nBut beating a 10 year old device isn't the standard we should judge them. They should be at the very least, on par with the contemporary options. If not much bigger if they expect a premium price above them.\n\nThat's when they'll be competing. Not in the past.\n\n> The economies of scale will kick in no doubt in a similar time frame. Just look at the M1 and M2 lineup compared to the significantly better value of the latest M4 producta.\n\nThat's hardware related. In fact, it's more proof that the software is essentially irrelevant in the equation.\n\nThe M1 didn't have Apple Intelligence. Yet the M4 with better hardware AND better software (or with more features at least)  is a better value.\n\nNor any of this happened when iPadOS split from iOS. They didn't charge a surplus for software on iPads now that they had a dedicated OS.\n\nIt's very clear the new software features do not affect the price in the same proportion as hardware, much less to add $600 extra per device. So it's possible I misunderstood, but from I got, you said that the hardware comparison didn't make sense because Apple also factors in the software.\n\nAnd I see absolutely no situation where Apple's software gives me that value. We are talking about the current Apple that promises features and cannot deliver them at all (features that _multiple_ competitors delivered faster and better). And you are saying it will be worth $600 extra (at MSRP) over their Android counterparts with 10 years of iterations and refinements? I would be massively shocked if they do anything more than iOS or at best some iOS/iPad hybrid.\n\nThat's why, to me, the difference would have to come exclusively on hardware to make it worth a $600+ premium.\n\nDo I expect it to be better than what was essentially a tech demo 10 years before the release of this product? Yes. If it's not it would be a colossal failure. But I also don't expect it to be anything much different than what we already have with iOS/iPad.\n\nOne or two potentially cool looking but ultimately not so useful feature. A handful of bugs, and some decently big omissions that will get patched in foldOS 2, 3, and so on. And that's it. \n\nI hope I'm wrong and they release some surprising software that changes the foldable work completely while the competition strives to compete, because it would mean Apple is getting their shit together. But I seriously doubt it'll be more than essentially the same thing we have on the iPhone/iPad, but now it folds.\n\nThat is, of course, assuming all of this isn't some leak from Apple or some Apple adjacent source just so people think this will cost $2500 and then it comes at the same price point of the competition under $2000 and then everyone is ok with it because they were expecting it to cost more.",

Samsung gives very large discounts on their foldable devices. You would almost have to avoid getting a discount for the phone. So, no the reality of pricing is not in line at $2k a phone.  I just don't see Apple being as generous with their discounts and I see a foldable iPhone at $2.3K having moderate (at best) sales.

Hell, I wouldn't mind it on my current 13 Pro Max if the feature actually segmented the screen into two parts - 2/3 for Safari or another app and 1/3 for the video. But no, it's literally just overlayed onto the underlying app, blocking the content underneath.\n\nApple's current PiP implementation is just garbage and I wished they took a cue from the iPad and its split screening. That said, no interest in a foldable device whatsoever. Just wished Apple improved their current software.",

Everyone has a bag with them nowadays. Backpack, purse, etc. If I want a larger screen, I\u2019d rather actually have a larger screen with much more usability, than a fake larger screen with a weird hinge down the middle. \n\nAnd given it took Apple like 5 years to fix the ugly notch so it looked good, I don\u2019t have high hopes for the folding hinge. \n\nWe\u2019re also still waiting on AirPods Max that live up to Bose QC 45.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the whole upgradable RAM issue with MacBooks, and STILL lack of integrated GPU or an integrated API for extending a GPU via port. \n\nAnd oh yeah, you still have to plug your Apple Watch in daily, despite Garmin coming out with watches that last 45-90 days between charges. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, Apple\u2019s innovation died with Steve Jobs. They\u2019ve been coasting on name for a while.\n\nArguably, if they don\u2019t come out with the M-series architecture, they\u2019d be on a downward trajectory right now. That\u2019s about the only thing saving them.\n\nBetween all of the things I listed, and the fact their biggest improvement for the last 5 iPhone releases is \u201cmore cameras\u201d and \u201csmaller notch\u201d and \u201cvaguely non-descriptive new ceramic/composite case or glass material no one has ever heard of\u201d they are just not releasing good products right now compared to competitors. I mean shit, do I even have to bring up Apple Intelligence vs. Microsoft CoPilot? CoPilot is GARBAGE compared to other similar apps out there like Gemini, Cursor, ChatGPT, etc. Yet, it is still miles ahead of Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple, if you read this let me tell you what the people actually want:\n\n- Let us upgrade our own devices\n- Stop using dark pricing strategies on your website to urge people to bump up to the next \u2018class\u2019 of device\n- Take longer between product releases and actually give us something innovative (no one cares if it takes years to release something, if it\u2019s good. Shit, just look at GTA VI as an example.)\n- Stop trying to constantly build upon a system that needs improvement. It\u2019s okay to redesign IOS from the ground up. Just because it works well, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t work better. I mean shit, it took them 10+ years to give us the much needed update of backspacing in the calculator app. The mail app still hasn\u2019t had a refresh. There are a lot of core apps that still need improvements, you don\u2019t have to only focus on hardware. I mean shit, the \u2018automator\u2019 app still exists on new MacBook installations. So does \u2018Photo Booth\u2019 and \u2018iMovie\u2019 and \u2018Color Meter\u2019. You mean to tell me that rather than updating the \u2018Automator\u2019 app to have modern functionality, Apple chose to release the \u2018shortcuts\u2019 app and \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019? That one is so easy to spot even I can see it. That was a golden opportunity right there to integrate Siri with \u2018Automator\u2019 and ChatGPT. \n\nApple is losing their core vision. Their product is suffering because they are losing the spirit of innovation, which is very sad considering that is what made them great.",

They've solved some really insanely hard problems, and keep focusing on those.\n\nHence why the scene graph is capable of determining when you change rooms, and then repinning you when you wake the device from sleep in the first room. And yet, they have pretty much no window management.\n\nI don't know when they're targeting a heavy rollout of consumer friendly features, but you can see the bones of what they're building now and I think a LOT more people are going to really pay attention.\n\nI see the audience. Apple sees the audience. If you're not paying attention to their SDK changes, you won't see the audience, but their audience is basically everyone who sits at a desk doing creative work.\n\nThat said, you're not missing out a huge amount on not having one. If you're doing swift/uikit development, you'll hit the ground running if you decide you want to target vision os. When they make their next big pitch (WWDC 2026 is the current vibe), you'll still have at least one or two major hardware revisions until it's price-accessible to most Apple consumers.",

Especially if the rumors are true about it being the first actually great one without a bad hinge and gradient. It's not really intended to instantly replace regular phones, not in the way the iPhone X was intended to end the era of bezels and home buttons. The foldable will be more like the iPad Air, it's not trying to replace the regular or Pro. It has its own benefits, and its own segment.

No well run business would.\u00a0\n\n\nSamsung walks that line because their tablets sell like garbage and the people buying them are either too poor to afford a foldable (hence the A series tablets) or not willing to compromise on the experience for a phone made with year to two year old parts.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s got to be a tough nut for Apple to crack. How do they differentiate between tablet and foldable? With Samsung most people don\u2019t own a Tab so it\u2019s easy. But I bet most people with an iPhone also own an iPad. Or have one in their household.\u00a0\n\n\nFoldable don\u2019t really compliment anything. They try to usurp. But in so doing, they execute everything poorly. They are bad phones because they aren\u2019t durable and sacrifice on features and practicality relative to bar phones. They are bad tablets for the same reasons.\u00a0\n\n\nThey are more of a fashion statement than anything at this point. Or useful in niche circumstances. There\u2019s a reason everyone with a Z flip always talks about putting them into their pockets. Most people don\u2019t have that problem with a normal phone. See also the overly vocal minority group demanding small phones\u2026 who then don\u2019t buy them in number.\u00a0",

It\u2019s not just about being able to afford it or not in the end, but the value proposition. \n\nThe annoying thing about carriers for me is that for some reason they selectively sell combinations of colors, sizes and storages. For example White titanium is available in smaller size and storage, but not in bigger storage or on Pro Max size, 512gb Pro only comes in black titanium, and no 1tb option at all\u2026 I called them years ago and they said their marketing team decides what combinations to sell. \n\nIt\u2019s a mess so i will for sure avoid buying through a carrier next time.",

I can defend that with longevity and 6-8y upgrade cycles, but there is a limit to that. Apple does so well with the Mac Mini and MacBook Air, they should focus more on appearing a good value proposition.\n\nWhen everybody said iPad will be 999 they introduced it at just 499 and it was a huge deal.",

A phone costing 3 MacBooks because it folds is past that.

The United States only has 155 million iPhone users. So 11% of the users live in the US and 89% in the rest of the world.\n\nThe excuse of mainly targeting and focusing on the wealthy American market for pricing like u say is wrong imo. People there might upgrade more often, but the potential is in new emerging markets and outside of the US. \n\nThey have been loud for decades that they try to make the best product they can for their users. Many of them are very competitive and beloved everywhere. But 3000usd for a folding device when probably the same chip, better camera, better durability will be in the 999 one wont appeal to many people no matter where they live. It\u2019s good to show off, but thats it. \n\nIt\u2019s pointless to argue about being frugal, or cheap, it\u2019s not about wealth, it\u2019s about value proposition. \n\nMost people in the world arent that fixated on owning the latest tech, newest device so it\u2019s funny when u say Apple outside the US is an aspirational goal or status symbol. I think it\u2019s more true for America like their sales show. It\u2019s not like Western European users aren\u2019t wealthy enough to upgrade every year. Lol",

I have zero desire to buy a dedicated tablet that I would need to worry about charging and carrying around on top of my normal EDC stuff, but I would use the shit out of extra screen real estate conveniently as part of the phone I have to have. I\u2019m constantly in wiring diagrams at work, and they can be hard to read on a phone. Flip it open, and I\u2019ve got way more room to work. I play games like chess on my phone, it would be cool to flip the phone open and have a mini tablet so the board is bigger than on a phone alone.

The iPhone screen is basically 20:9 so a folding phone would have a big screen that is roughly 20:18 which is pretty much square.\u00a0\n\nThe problem is, content isn\u2019t square. Apps are built to run on screens with the iPhone ratio. If you want to watch video, videos typically aren\u2019t square so you\u2019re gonna have big black boxes above and below the video, wasting much of that precious real estate.\u00a0\n\nI could imagine running two apps side-by-side, but I really don\u2019t need to do that often.\n\nSo I ask you, how would you actually use the phone like this that\u2019s any better than the phone you are already looking at?",

The camera is great, the screen is great, it computes well, it\u2019s got a great interface, and it\u2019s fairly rugged.\n\nI feel the same way about a folding phone as I do About the Lexus SUV that I inherited from my dad when he passed away. It\u2019s very nice, but it\u2019s just filled with stuff that is going to break at some point.\n\nI recently found out that this Lexus, which my wife drives as her primary vehicle, has had a nonstop beep for the last couple of months. My wife had tuned it out, but I noticed it very quickly when I drove the car about a week ago.\n\nI couldn\u2019t figure out what was causing this beep. It wasn\u2019t a tire pressure sensor, it had enough oil, and the fluids were up to snuff, And a variety of other things seemed to be in perfect condition.\n\nI brought it to a local mechanic and he discovered the issue right away. The third row of seats was folded down, but apparently it wasn\u2019t folded down 100%. It was only folded down about 98%. The fact that it was just barely lifted up caused this beeping, and there was no indicator telling me what the problem might be. The seats looked like they were folded down completely.\n\nThis was the moment that I learned that I had a third row of seats in my vehicle. Apparently they have an electric switch that is only visible if you flip down the backseats. So this third row is only accessible if you use electric switches that are not visible when you are using the car normally.\n\nSo many unnecessary complications. So many extra parts that don\u2019t need to be there and that can break. Luxury is great, I love my seat heaters and my steering wheel heater. But when they break, it\u2019s going to feel like my life got worse instead of it simply returning to normal.\n\nI feel this way about a folding iPhone. More screen to break, hinges to malfunction, added unnecessary weight, more power usage, the list goes on.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t imagine a usage model that makes a dual screen or extra wide \u201csquare\u201c iPhone Necessary.",

I\u2019ve never had a problem, but more than half a dozen of my immediate family have sworn off the Samsung foldables because their Z fold 4 and a 5 all broke just outside of warranty. We are talking men, women, all adults, various activity levels and standards of care for phones. One of them is rough with phones. Most of them aren\u2019t and simply work from home all the time. Phones were cased at all times.\u00a0\n\n\nBut always the same story regardless of which house was complaining about them. One day out of the blue they went to open the phone and the internal folding screen was absolutely busted. No compression. They went to sleep with it on a table and woke up to a broken screen after opening it. \u00a0Another closed it, set it down to watch a movie in their living room, and the screen stopped working when they went to use it. Similar stories \u00a0for several more people.\u00a0\n\n\nTwo of the people are married and their Z folds broke at almost the same time (within the same month but different days). Same issue each time though.\u00a0\n\n\nSamsung is shit for customer service and even worse for getting repairs or warranty work done. Amazingly, most of these people went back to the galaxy candy bar phones as soon as they could.\u00a0\n\n\nSo yeah, folds are a nightmare. People say they are fine but it\u2019s is supreme bad luck for everyone I know who\u2019ve gotten them. No idea how well the flips hold up.\u00a0",

Transparent aluminum ([Aluminium oxynitride - ALON](https://www.surmet.com))\n\n3. Flexible ceramic glass \n\n4. Bonus: Graphene based coatings\n\nSome of these are still in R&D and may or may not ever reach widespread commercial adoption.\n\nI studied gorilla glass because a good friend in grad school was working directly with Corning, which was right down the street from us. However, I'm more of a polymers person/advanced materials and not much of a glass guy.\n\nThere's quite a bit that we can do with advanced polymers, laminates, and nanocomposites that really hasn't been tapped into yet. I made multifunctional nanoparticles with polymers grafted to their surface. You can bond phosphors and other particles to the ends of those polymer chains to get functionality. If Apple focused more on switching to photonics from electronics, replacing electrical components with optical components, that would be a game changer. I know that Samsung has already put out a novel optical chip. One of my research projects was on developing technology for this switch (optical wave guides, specifically).\n\nIf they spent their money on paving the way with this transition, we could have sci-fi like phones that just look like a piece of glass in your hand, because what you need to push photons around is so much smaller than electrons (electrons are pretty fatty compared to photons, even though electrons are small). A good amount of work has been done on figuring this stuff out, but we won't see some magical leap, it'll be a step-by-step progression.\n\n^(I'll try to come back and add more details)",
