After producing iPhones in India for export to other countries, Apple is getting ready to do the same with AirPods.\n\nAccording to sources of The Economic Times, Apple will be commencing manufacture of AirPods from April. The production will be taking place at a Foxconn plant located in Hyderabad, with AirPods produced at the facility intended for exports only.\n\nThe report doesn't say what models of AirPods will be produced at the plant.\n\nThe facility has apparently been in the works for a while, with Foxconn approving a Rs 3,500 crore ($400 million) fund to set up the factory back in August 2023. Reports from July 2024 pointed to Apple looking into producing AirPods charging cases in the country, while trial AirPods production in the Hyderabad facility allegedly started in December.",
