Hardware has done their job with amazing chips, but you\u2019re telling me Apple can\u2019t create a touch MacOS? Very sad to see, give me their $65B in cash and I could do it myself.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is recent reports of a foldable Mac/Ipad thing that will supposedly get MacOS. Who the hell wants foldable MacOS and the nightmare developing/maintaining that software? I owned a foldable phone and it was too easy to scratch accidentally and was a nightmare with potential of water damage. Also most media won\u2019t support the aspect ratio of a foldable.\n\nWhatever reason they\u2019re pursuing that, just give us MacOS on Ipad instead.
