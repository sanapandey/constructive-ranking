But there's many avenues to explain the rumored changes, including simply refreshing a \"stale\" design.\n\nOr, perhaps, Apple is preparing for a future which brings aspects of Vision Pro over to Macs. I can definitely see Apple updating the sensor array to accommodate \"spatial computing\" with proper air gesture support.\n\nDwell and Headpointer are primitive compared to where Apple can take things.\n\nWhich feeds into another point: doing this enables a future where Macs could truly be tablet devices sans keyboard. Because all of it could be controlled via a sensor array (albeit with much more limited FOV than Vision Pro) for the tasks requiring fine control away from a keyboard and mouse. No need for full spatial awareness and tracking; just immediately in front of the device where hands could be seen.\n\nI'm not holding my breath, though. I just think it is a neat possibility.\n\nEdit: but I don't see a reason for Apple to need to do this. Mac sales are doing well. They've refined their form factor so much that competitors just copy them poorly. They have a segment established for basically every typical buyer. I don't see what a tablet Mac brings to the table in terms of what Macs currently lack *other than* cannibalizing iPads or serving a preference. A preference I have, to be clear. But Macs have never been more portable than now.",
