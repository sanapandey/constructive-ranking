(Glad to have you back again.) He is more upbeat and content. Music also reinforces he is perfect as the way he is and can work on himself?\n\nHe looks back at his depressed/sad himself reassuring himself, it will be okay **Someday**.\n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk I guess.",

We have pedestrian zones in the city center that are calm and quiet, even when lots of people are roaming around. When I take the subway and walk through interconnecting tunnels between lines during rush hour with hundreds of people it\u2018s calm. Central city park with masses of people? Quiet. I now live in an apartment building with hundreds others, facing the inner courtyard that is architecturally closed of from the street - in the summer I can leave my windows open around the clock and it\u2019s calm and quiet. Maybe on Friday and Sunday people have a party and you hear music and laughter, maybe some children playing. Maybe sometimes a neighbor has a loud fight, or a very intense orgasm. But it\u2019s still calm and quiet overall. Old city center tourism district with thousands of people, no cars allowed - I could sit there in a caf\u00e9 outside for hours, and relax. Yes, friday night in certain areas, sure - loud music, loud people. Football games, concerts and such are loud for a few hours. But that\u2018s sometimes. Not every day, in every district, around the clock. Cities aren\u2018t loud. Cars are. Around the clock, in every street. They are the only, constant irritating noise that almost never subsides.",

Take away the cars and people aren't going to run through at 35mph - that roar of cars rushing by is going to be replaced by large crowd of people constantly walking and talking, horse hoofs and cart wheels on cobblestone.

But nobody is saying we should just get rid of cars and keep everything else exactly the same. We're asking for systemic changes: cities designed to be walkable with areas of interest and housing in close proximity, public transportation, etc. \n\nObviously if you snapped your fingers and made all cars disappear from North America, it would leave millions of people completely unable to live their lives. That's because everything is so spread out and there aren't viable transportation methods for everybody.",
