It\u2019s a very niche product imo, I can\u2019t see them selling tons of these but 30 day battery life is probably the best selling point otherwise why wouldn\u2019t you just buy a Fitbit or something similar.

It\u2019s a talking point of the product\n\n>It was focused on getting information and notifications on your watch.\n\nOther than telling the time, yeah. And it never evolved past that, so it sold less and less and less until they were bought out for pennies on the dollar ($740 million valuation -> $23 million buy out, source: Quartz)\n\n>Social media wasn't a thing for the first watch\n\nUh\u2026. I think you misunderstood me. The product was *borne of* social media. The whole thing was a Kick-starter campaign in 2012. It spread virally on social media.\n\nI\u2019ve already said in other comments on here I\u2019m a fan. Doesn\u2019t mean my arguments are invalid.

Not financially, but I wouldn\u2019t be debating this\n\nAnd considering he named the product Core 2 Duo\u2026 lmfao.

Not the \u201cPebble market\u201d which does not exist both literally and figuratively. There is not \u201ciPhone market.\u201d There is a smartphone market.

You are deliberately ignoring EVERYTHING I say.\u00a0\n\nThey did NOT sell fine. That is why they went from $740 million valuation to a $23 million buy out.

From the Quartz article I linked:\n\n>\u00a0Today, Migicovsky is selling Pebble\u2019s software and intellectual property to competitor Fitbit for less than $40 million, in a deal that\u2019s mainly about hiring the company\u2019s engineers, according\u00a0to Bloomberg\n\nHe knew it was about a pure IP play.\n\n>\u00a0But keep yelling because you're irrelevant arguments\n\nYou aren\u2019t reading what I write, so there\u2019s no point.

By modeling where this tipping point was, Apple was able to determine when the links would stop being an advantage to developers, which would push them back to using IAP.\n\n> Apple also found that more restrictive rules around the placement and formatting of the links themselves could reduce the number of apps that decided to implement these outside links. The company looked into the financial impact of excluding some other partners \u2014 like those in its video and news programs \u2014 from the new program.\n\n> The company weighed different options for when to charge commissions, too. At one time, it thought to charge its 27% fee on external purchases that took place within 72 hours of when the link was clicked. When the new guidelines went live, however, that time frame had been stretched to seven days.\n\n> Lawyers suggested Cook himself was involved with how the warning to App Store customers would appear, recommending an update to the text that appears when the external links were clicked. In one version, that link warned customers they were \u201cno longer transacting with Apple.\u201d Later, the link was updated to subtly suggest there could be privacy or security risks with purchases made on the web.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/apple-exec-phil-schiller-testifies-that-he-raised-concerns-over-app-store-commissions-on-web-based-sales/",

That doesn't mean it's right.\n\n> And it\u2019s sillier to argue that only open ecosystems, where every sort of works but not that great, are legal.\n\nOpen doesn't mean worse than closed. And closed doesn't mean better than open. That's a massive misunderstanding. \n\nIn any case, it's not about open or closed in terms of being legal.\n\nIs about unfair advantage when you have a dominant position.\n\nIf Apple had 10% of the market, it would be irrelevant if they are open or not. \n\nAnd btw, it's obviously not legal in a huge part of the world. There's a reason why almost every major country is having antitrust investigations against Apple.",

Updating widgets works only on occassion. Push notifications get throttled. APIs necessary for the function of one of our apps got removed because some other apps abused them, even though we didn't.

Basically iOS does not have the concept of \u2018interprocess communication\u2019(IPC) like on Android. What we did before was publish an SDK that other apps (like Strava) could integrate to make their own BLE connection to Pebble. It was a clunky quasi-solution that other apps didn\u2019t like, because it was hard to test (among other things)\n* If you (accidentally) close our iOS app, then your watch can\u2019t talk to app or internet\n* Impossible for watch to detect if you are using your phone, so your watch will buzz and display a notification even if you are staring at your iPhone \n* You can\u2019t easily side load apps onto an iPhone. That means we have to publish the app on the iPhone appstore. This is a gigantic pain because Apple. Every update comes with the risk that a random app reviewer could make up some BS excuse and block the update.\n* Because of iOS Appstore rules, it would be hard for us to enable 3rd party watchface/app developers to charge for their work (ie we can\u2019t easily make an appstore within our app)\n* Getting a Javascript engine to run in PebbleOS forced us to go through many hoops due to iOS \u2014 creating a compiler inside the Pebble iPhone app that in itself needed to be written in (cross-compiled to) JS to work with Apple's restriction on downloadable code can only be JS\n* As a Pebble watch/app developer, using the iOS app as relay to the watch sucks since the \"developer mode\" terminates every few minutes",

Also, I\u2019ve owned one, and it sucked (in my view).\u00a0After Apple launched Apple Watch \u2014 more well made, better functioning, and it has actually saved people\u2019s lives \u2014 Pebble floundered into irrelevancy and buyout.\u00a0\n\nNow he sees certain governments ignoring important world events and placing utmost priority on third party app marketplaces on iOS, so he relaunches Pebble despite knowing the situation with smart watches is still largely the same, and he\u2019s going to opine about how Apple is \u201canti-competitive,\u201d and \u201cevil,\u201d \u00a0and how \u201cit\u2019s not fair\u201d that something they made for their own platform is more reliable and higher quality than a third party device.\u00a0\n\nSo basically the whole thing is just him trying to get back at Apple (and yeah, I disagree with him) and relive his glory days.\n\nI\u2019ve moved on dude. It was a cute device, but you need to make something else worthwhile. I don\u2019t care for this.\n\nEdit: Lmfao the Pebble brigade is here. -7 dislikes in a single minute\u00a0\n\nEdit 2: LOL, he literally named the watch \u201cCore 2 Duo\u201d\n\nEdit 3: LITERALLY A 30 DAY WARRANTY.

It wasn't just that the Pebble was 3rd party that made the Apple Watch so much better, the AW was really Next Gen (or two) and far more premium in quality.\n\nI'm not so sure I agree with your theory at least in terms of his intentions, but I do agree with it in terms of how it's playing out.\n\nReading through the points on the post, almost all of it isn't Apple blocking, but rather not building, and that has implications for the consumers who want the choice of having a closed platform, when there are plenty of other phones and watches from other manufacturers that are more open.\n\nA closed platform has advantages and disadvantages compared to an open one like Android.  According to Pebble, 40% of their interested customers have iPhones.  That means \\~60% have phones from any number of vendors that are more open.\n\nI get that others may want Apple to build and open up for 3rd parties and may want the Pebble to work as fully as the Apple Watch with the iPhone, but wanting this as a consumer shouldn't be how governments determine laws, especially when they'd be taking away the consumer choice for pretty much the only closed phone platform on the market.\n\nOn the other hand, **anything that is Apple blocking for the sake of anti-competitiveness as opposed to not building out, providing security, etc... those points should be made independently with legal action**, but the reality is, iOS wasn't built such that a 3rd party watch would have the same level of functionality as an Apple Watch.",

Wow, that\u2019s a run rate that, currently, looks like the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s not an updated, current, new tech watch, it\u2019s the same old tech that didn\u2019t catch on by 2016.",

Third party device manufacturers then have to make the decision of allowing iOS users to use their product with limited functionality as compared to the Apple Watch or not release it for them entirely. On the flip side, they are more than free to release for Android users but only the enthusiasts really go for those as they\u2019re generally the ones who would care or are willing to pay the premium versus the large majority who buy less expensive models to begin with.
