The issue is that the person who created the family sharing setup seems to have caused a small glitch, which didn\u2019t bother me at first, but now it\u2019s getting annoying. Whenever I link an Apple product (like AirPods) to my phone, it uses the name I set up for them in Messages, instead of mine. I\u2019ve tried Googling a solution and changing settings, but I can\u2019t seem to fix it.\n\nI thought I could just change the name of my AirPods through Bluetooth, and while I can do that, the change doesn\u2019t show up in the Find My app. In the Find My app, my name is still showing up with a glitch\u2014it shows \u201c(me)\u201d next to the name, but it\u2019s the same name as the person who set up the family sharing. While my email appears correctly, my name doesn\u2019t, and it won\u2019t let me change it.",
