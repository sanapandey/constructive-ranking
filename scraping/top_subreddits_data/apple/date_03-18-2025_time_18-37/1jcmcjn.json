    "selftext": "Have you ever gone looking for a toucan emoji, only to realize\u2014to your absolute shock\u2014that it doesn\u2019t exist? You\u2019re not alone. Many of us could swear we\u2019ve seen one before, but in reality, the world is missing one of the most vibrant, iconic birds in emoji form.\nIt\u2019s time to fix this. The toucan is a symbol of tropical beauty, biodiversity, and even a beloved mascot for brands and pop culture. If flamingos, parrots, and dodos can have their own emojis, why not the majestic toucan?\nA toucan emoji would add flair to conversations, whether you\u2019re talking about the rainforest, vacations, Froot Loops nostalgia, or just want a bright and cheerful bird to express yourself. Let\u2019s show Unicode that the people demand a toucan emoji\u2014sign and share to make it happen!\n#AddTheToucan #ToucanEmojiNow\n\nhttps://chng.it/m2fHkrDKh5",

And unfortunately I didn't attend a meeting 6 years ago in anticipation of this question to give OP the reasoning as to its rejection.",
