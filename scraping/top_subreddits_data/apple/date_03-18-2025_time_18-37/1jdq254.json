That's why these apps send your password (!) to the server of the app manufacturer that then logs into your email account and checks for new email constantly. Upon receiving a new mail, it then sends a push notification to the installed app.\n\nTherefore, the app manufacturer has your password and can access your email account from their servers. You completely give up any control.",
