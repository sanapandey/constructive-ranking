I hope apple can achieve something similar or much improved.",

To achieve this, the company has successfully reduced the display driver integrated circuit (IC) from 28nm to 16nm\u2014a significant advancement. This may help prolong battery life.\n\n>According to analyst Jeff Pu, Apple's first foldable recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn, with mass production slated to begin in the second half of 2026. Reports suggest Apple could launch the device either late next year or in early 2027.\n\n>The Weibo user has a number of accurate previous claims, including that the iPhone 7 would be water-resistant, the standard \u200ciPhone\u200c 14 models would continue using the A15 Bionic chip (with the more advanced A16 chip being exclusive to the \u200ciPhone\u200c 14 Pro models), and Apple would build servers to support Apple Intelligence using Apple Silicon hardware.

Apple benefits massively from having a relatively simple lineup of iOS devices. Introducing hybrid phone/tablet devices with weird aspect ratios may require changes in OS and app development to accommodate. Having these requirements can be degrade experiences. You can see this on the android side where there are so many different device types that creating a good experience across all of them becomes very difficult.",
