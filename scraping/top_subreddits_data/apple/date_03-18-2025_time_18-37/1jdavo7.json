Apple pulled the plug on that over fears that a thin device with a giant screen would be susceptible to bending. The company suffered such a controversy in 2014 \u2014 \"Bendgate\" \u2014 when the iPhone 6 Plus would sometimes warp when in a tight pocket.*\n\nEarlier this month, we reported on a rumor out of China claiming that the iPhone 17 Air shares the same dimensions as the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices. It's quite possible the rumor had its origins in Apple's canned prototype.\n\nCorroborating rumors indicate that the iPhone 17 Air that Apple will launch in September will feature a 6.6-inch display with 120Hz ProMotion support, a Dynamic Island, an A19 chip, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, and Apple's custom-made C1 modem. Gurman has been told that the device may start at roughly $899 in the U.S., which is the same price point as the iPhone 16 Plus that the ultra-thin device is believed to be replacing in Apple's smartphone lineup.",

Poor battery life on the short lived 12 Mini, then the 13 Mini had its legs cut by its high price, poor marketing, and the SE2 release.  \nA new model of **17 Air Nano** (or mini) in the 5.4 inch screen size, would fix SO many issues, and give an update avenue for a large group that is on 3-5 year old phones.  \n  \nTo me it\u2019s a no brainer easy option, but if they even try it it\u2019s probably a fall release, which will again f*ck it over by people thinking it\u2019s a gimped budget model at \u201cnew model\u201d pricing.",
