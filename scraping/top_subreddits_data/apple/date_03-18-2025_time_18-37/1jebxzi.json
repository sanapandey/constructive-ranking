The good news is that Capcom is running a promotional discount of 67% off the usual price for a limited time.\n\n>We're having trouble accessing the US App Store right now. But in the UK App Store, from now until April 16, the base game can be purchased for \u00a38.29, while all in-game rewards can be unlocked for \u00a31.69. After that date, the game will be sold for \u00a324.99. Expect approximately equivalent US prices.\n\n>Resident Evil 3 requires an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 series model to run, along with iPads and Macs equipped with an M1 chip, A17 Pro chip, or later. The game supports cross-progression across supported Apple devices, so players can continue their progress whether playing on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. It's also a universal purchase, meaning a single purchase grants access across all compatible Apple devices.\n\n>Capcom says the app is approximately 31GB in size, and that the installation process requires the target drive to have at least twice the size of the app in storage space available. An internet connection is also required to start the game. Resident Evil 3 can be downloaded from the App Store.",
