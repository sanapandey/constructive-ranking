    "selftext": "\nI've finally managed to do it. I've hit GoD. It's taken over 13 months and 830+ hours, but I've made it.  I didn't actually expect to get it today, but somehow it just happened. I had been stressing over the last two weeks if I was actually going to get GoD before Season 2 dropped, and thankfully I made it in time. Funnily enough, I was more stressed out at the beginning of the session than at the end, mostly because I was really on a losing streak. I managed to calm down and compose myself and make that final push though. Even though it'll be gone in two weeks' time, I'm still glad to have reached this milestone at last, as now I know I can get here again someday.

                                    "body": "Alright, so when fighting against Victor, remember that 90% of his movelist loses to SSR. the only things that don't are: d/b+4, d+4, d/f+4, d+1+2, Iai 1, Iai 2, WS 1+2 and (sometimes) u+1. Everything else doesn't work against SSR, even if Victor is +5 or whatever. This means that against a Victor who is forgetting to check your sidestep will likely just whiff if you continue to SSR. Being unafraid to step against Victor will be of great help in making him question his offense.\n\nWhen you're fighting as Victor, don't feel the need to do too many lows. If you have good fundamentals, you can poke and move and get your opponent to give you an opening without having to do a risky low. D/b+4 is fun and all, but it's still death on block. Also, the d/b+2, ws 1+2, d/b+2, ws 1+2, etc flowchart is great against opponents who don't want to step or commit to a hopkick/orbital and over-rely on jabs (Since the d/b+2 high crushes, and the ws 1+2 high crushes a bit as well). It works even at Tekken God level, for context. Also, lots of players love to mash or step after the ws 1+2. It's +8 on hit, so d+2 is a great move to stop them mashing or moving after the ws 1+2 hits.\n\nHonestly, ws 1+2, d+2, d+4 and 1,2 are very great moves that really hold Victor together at high-level play. Getting used to using those moves will help a lot in avoiding you from over-relying on the committal stuff (Iai stance, d/b+4, etc).\n\nIf you want, you can add me on Steam or on Tekken 8 and I could check your replays or maybe practice with you.",
