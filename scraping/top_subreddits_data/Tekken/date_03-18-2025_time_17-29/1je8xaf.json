The only thing that is a little ludicrous is that Jaguar Sprint in heat is armored.\n\nHe has one unbreakable throw that has a 23 frame start up and has a much more obvious animation than any of the other attacks out of JS. His crouch throws are unbreakable, but they can't be spammed bc if guesses wrong he gets very easily launched. \n\nHe can be jabbed out of the Jaguar Sprint after the heat smash, which is why most pros will cancel it into a different attack\n\nThe only grabs that are unreactable are Shining Wizard and Giant swing. The only players that can ACTUALLY mix up those throws (iSW and running GS) are gold ranks and above. Every other throw that he has follows the same rules as the other characters with perfect throw games (Jin, Nina, Paul, Drag, Hwo). \n\nHe's easy to spam cheese at lower ranks but is more difficult to pilot the higher you go, with his movement being among the worst in the game. You could argue that Jaguar Step offsets that but he can be floated out of it for a full float combo. The damage definitely does not come easy at higher ranks, King is consistently a top 3 chosen character regardless of region so the matchup is well understood by everyone. \n\nI can agree that the tracking on his heat burst and heat smash need to be nerfed, but his big throws already had their tracking nerfed. GS, TT, Muscle Buster, and Tombstone can all be stepped as of about a year ago\n\nI'm going to assume King's \"low that looks like a mid\" that you're referring to is ffn2, which again, can be stepped pretty easily. It doesnt track at all either way, and its -13 on block so characters like Kazuya can launch him for it. If anything, other characters have ch launching lows that have way more damage potential than that move\n\nI hope you don't take this as me trying to insinuate anything about you or your knowledge, I'm just trying to have a conversation about this :)",

I'm sure that the lack of matchup knowledge helps a lot, but the same could be said for King, especially considering the size of King's movelist. As a character's damage potential, we could call it even, but from an execution and ease of piloting perspective, I think Kuma simplifies the game in a way that King can't",
