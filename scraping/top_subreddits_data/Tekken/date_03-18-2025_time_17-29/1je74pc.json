    "selftext": "The reason I'm asking this is because it seems that higher level players(TK+)get very upset when they get hit with a snake edge, especially Bryan's. I've seen people t-bag, kicharge, after they eat one to the legs. I personally think it's really funny when it happens, and if the opponent's patterns allow me to (i.e. side walking a lot. side step into high/slow mid) I will get at least one off in a match. \n\nBut I'm genuinely curious, do people actually get upset when they eat a snake edge? When I get hit with one, it's a bit of a FFS why didn't I block low moment, but it seems for some people (esp kaz players) it's like you've just punched their mother in the face. ",

I tend to get upset at myself because I think I\u2019ve blocked one snake edge ever on the first time it was used in a set, which is ridiculous considering how many things I can react to that are much quicker.

I literally forgot the character even have a snake edge (Lili, Xiaoyu, Dragunov)\n\nThis is annoying as fuck bc deep down i know, but i'm still trying to go keep up with the knowledge required in this game yet especially when i go long periods not fighting specific characters\n\n3. Mental stack beating my ass so bad i cannot react to shit unless it's pretty telegraphed they will do it\n\nThis one frustrate me the most bc it's constant reactable bullshit, i see the move my brain goes \"REACT\" but i don't follow through and i get blown up and it's always a cheap ass very easy to play against setup like Devil Jin guard break on oki, Yoshimitsu doing the most telegraphed unblockable ever, but i'm still getting clapped\n\n4. Law weird sweep (bonus)\n\nLaw is annoying as fuck, every Law player is annoying, i don't like him... It's starting to get to Guile levels of annoyance where i don't enjoy the fight at all bc of how they play and i start not giving a shit anymore",
