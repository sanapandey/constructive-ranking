But also the ghosts are just statistical models of what people do they can probably write some stuff to just look at which ghosts have cheater inputs and go from there. It could be one of the original motivations to make ghosts too, not sure.\n\nI think it would be great if they just made all the data public, then they could let some grad student do it for them.",
