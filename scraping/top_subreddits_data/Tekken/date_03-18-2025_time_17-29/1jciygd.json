He has long reaching pokes and keep out tools to stop you going in. Once you've been conditioned to stay still, he can go in with his slower but effective pressure starters. He can also move fast with his back dash despite his clunky appearance so if you make the mistake of whiffing, he can punish you heavily with his strong whiff punish options. In Tekken 8, he's given a new stance, Gamma Howl, that allows him to be a stance/pressure character and is blessed with arguably the strongest and fastest heat smash in the game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Can easily create mixups with his Gamma Howl\n* Mid-range bully. Long reaching pokes and punishers.\n* Complete throw game\n* Fastest heat smash in the game\n* High damage opportunities. Lots of ways to trigger stage interactions and debilitating single hits.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Big character. Has difficulty side stepping some moves compared to other characters and other more damaging combo routes become available against him.\n* His generic pokes (jab and df1) are 1 frame slower.\n* Struggles under pressure. Heavily relies on Power Crushes and f2 as \u201cget off me\u201d tools.\n* Lacks safe CH tools. His best CH tool, f2, is unsafe.\n\n# Cheese Strings You Must Punish Everytime\n\n**A full video can be watched here:** [How To Beat Jack-8's Strings in Tekken 8 - Pulling At Strings](https://youtu.be/9f5NYzEAd1Y?si=GcdbfZ1hRFJdkHcU) but if you don\u2019t want to watch, here\u2019s a table I made instead (although not complete).\n\n**Punishable Strings**\n\n|Move|Startup|Hit|Frame Data on Block (Last Hit)|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2,1,2|10f|H,M,M|\\-12|A delayed 3^(rd) hit launcher to catch people taking advantage of 2,1\u2019s frames on block.|\n|F3,1+2|15f|M,M|\\-11|2^(nd) Hit can be heavily delayed.

This is his new \u201ccheap\u201d addition to keep up with Tekken 8\u2019s aggression. Without this, he\u2019ll be forced to slow down and play a sort of Tekken 7-ish style which, again, isn\u2019t enough to win. Aggression is the central theme of this game. Unfortunately, Jack\u2019s T7 style isn\u2019t enough to dominate (or at least consistently win) with pokes alone. It must be set up with movement to create big whiffs, be a momentum starter for pressure, or must have a threatening follow up to condition the opponent not to press. Take GMH away and he\u2019ll have a hard time getting anything started.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8pkj2w551pe1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5742c8226a6840e1835861bfd4f750164a55e4a6\n\n# I. Gamma Howl (GMH) and Gamma Charged (GMC)\n\nWhat is GMH?\n\nGamma Howl is Jack-8\u2019s new stance in Tekken 8. It gives him easy high damage ~~mixup~~ high/mid attack options on hit with some having chipping plus frames on block. These attacks becomes even scarier when Gamma Charged. Listing out every move in this stance took up a lot more than I expected so you can find every GMH move along with their properties and visual aids here:\u00a0 [wavu.wiki/t/Jack-8\\_movelist#GMH\\_(Gamma\\_Howl)](http://wavu.wiki/t/Jack-8_movelist#GMH_(Gamma_Howl))\n\n**TLDR of GMH Stance:**\n\n* His fastest move is GMH 4 which is 14f fast. He can only enforce a frame trap whenever he\u2019s +4 and in GMH.\n* GMH 1+2 is the only command throw so whenever you see a grab from GMH, always break with a 1+2.\n* Jack can transition to FC after GMH 3 by holding d but the frame data changes to only +2 on block and +7 on hit.\n\n**Other important notes not mentioned:**\n\n* GMH 3+4 is a bubble that bursts around Jack so not only is this homing, but it also hits people behind Jack\u2019s back.\n* GMH f1 and GMH f2 can sometimes high crush after some GMH transitions. More on these later on stance transitions.\n\nGamma Charged (GMC)\n\nGMC is a GMH that is empowered when he is in heat or successfully absorbs an attack when manually entering this stance. Here\u2019s a full breakdown of GMH vs GMC:\u00a0 [TEKKEN 8 Breakdown! What's the difference between Gamma Howl and Gamma Charge?](https://youtu.be/zrxZDST_K7I?si=TlZsgp3Ui40QbcoW)\n\n**TLDW of GMC**\n\n* GMC 1 is a screw launcher on hit.\n* GMC 2 is armoured and has a guard break (+11) on block. This makes 2,3 or Heat Smash guaranteed after you block this move. You can, however, still parry this move even when in GMC\n* GMC 4 and GMH 3+4 in heat can be used for heat dashes.\n\n**How to beat GMH**\n\nTo beat GMH, you need to be familiar with what move he uses to transition to GMH. Some are worse than others while some are true mixups. Do note that the next sections will only cover GMH transitions on block unless specified. On hit, these GMH transitions are usually a true mixup.\n\n**A. Gimmick Transitions** (b32d and f3+4d)\n\n|Move|Startup|String|On Block (with GMH transition)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|B3,2d|22f|Mid, High|0|\n|f3+4|20f|Mid|\\-3|\n\nThe first category is gimmick transitions which are the fakest GMH transitions. It doesn\u2019t put Jack at enough + frames to enforce a frame trap mixup and both are easily beaten with multiple option selects. B3,2 is also a mid high string that doesn\u2019t have a mid mixup so you can evade the mix entirely by duck and launching. At these frames (on block)**,** **GMH f1 and f2 will crush jabs and possibly some highs and grabs as well** which catch people off guard.\n\nOptions selects:\n\n* Generic df1 \u2013 These beat every option including jump back but is low reward. For GMH 3+4, you will recover fast enough to block it.\n* SSL Block \u2013 This is your best defensive option against SET A move. This makes every move whiff and blocks GMH 1 and 3+4.\n* Throws (but lab it first!) \u2013 Throws are a good OSs at these frames **but, lab them first to know which throws connect consistently.** As an example, some of Feng\u2019s throws work against GMH f1 but not GMH f2 so he\u2019ll have to give up on this OS. Jack can still break the throw if he doesn\u2019t attack but is harder on CH.\n* Rage Art - RAs beat everything including the GMH jump back. Jack can\u2019t recover from GMH fast enough to block it. However, make sure to confirm the transition first before doing so.\n* Generic D4 \u2013 Beats every attack but low damage and \u2013 on hit. I recommend other OS instead.\n\n**B. Fast AF transition moves**\n\n|Move|Startup|StringHit|On Block (with GMH transition)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|F3d & Ws3d+4|15f|Mid|\\+2|\n\nAlthough Jack is at +2, his fastest move from GMH is GMH 4 which is 14f. This isn\u2019t enough + frames to enforce a frame trap mixup but at these frames (on block), **GMH f1 and f2 will crush jabs and possibly some highs and grabs as well** just like set A. The transition between these moves is also too fast to sidestep.\n\nOptions selects:\n\n* 10-11f Throws (but lab it first!) \u2013 Again, just like Set A, throws are a good OSs at these frames as long as it won\u2019t get crushed. Dragunov, for example, has a 1 and 2 command throw but it whiffs vs GMH f2. But why less than 12f? The thing is, if a throw connects with an attack at the same time, the attack always wins. You can test this yourself by recording f3d to GMH 4 and using your 12f throw.\n* Generic D4 \u2013 Beats every attack but low damage and \u2013 on hit.\n* Rage Art \u2013 At these frames, Jack still can\u2019t recover fast enough from GMH to block the RA. You only have a few frames of leeway to confirm so do it so if you managed to lock in and visually confirm the transition. RAs will beat everything.\n\nNot a lot of consistent rewarding option selects for this category. The transition between these moves is too fast to consistently react to and step. I don\u2019t know if S2\u2019s sidestep buffer will help with this so for defensive options, blocking might be your best option. You can do either of the OSs to get a read first and then do the necessary risks after.\n\n**C. True Mixups** (ss2/uf3 on hit)\n\n|Move|Startup|Hit|Frames|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ss2d|17f (but a bit slower because it comes out of a sidestep)|Mid|\\+9 (on block)|\n|Uf3|24f|Low|\\+8 (on hit)|\n\nThe 3rd set is true mixups. These 2 moves are too plus which restricts our movement and our previous option selects. The safest thing to do is to block or duck for the GMH 4 read but besides this, there are 3 (2 situational options and 1 character specific techs) offensive options we have as counter play.\n\n1. **Rage Art** \u2013 Jack can block the RA if he doesn\u2019t attack immediately but this is good against auto pilot/flow chart players who immediately attack after going to GMH (which is like 90% of the Jack playerbase). RAs beat everything except GMH 4 so if you have the read and have some life to tank his GMH offense, it\u2019s a good option.\n2. **Character Specific Techs** \u2013 GMH moves have differing startup frames so your typical parry/sabaki with short active frames isn\u2019t consistent as a defensive tool. Some, however, have special properties that solve this problem.\n   * **Asuka and Jun** (b1+3/b2+4) can hold their parry to mitigate this problem. Loses to GMH 3+4 and GMH throw.\n   * **Leroy\u2019s** b2 has a longer active parry window so he also mitigates this problem. Loses to GMH 3+4 and GMH throw.\n   * **Bryan\u2019s** Snake Eyes ff1+2 will beat everything except GMH 3+4 and GMH 4 when done after ss2 on block (it\u2019s too + ig). Mash 1+2 after doing the ff1+2 to cover GMH 1+2.\n3. **Generic dick jab** (distance dependent) \u2013 This beats every attack except GMH 3+4, GMH f2, GMH crouch throw, and GMH 3 (depending on the distance). No one does the crouch throw randomly and the moves GMH 3+4 and GMH f2 are both punishable mids. For GMH 3\\*\\*, d1s tend to whiff\\*\\* **at medium range and consistently beats them at max range** because Jack puts his leg up in the air which makes them whiff. The exception to this are d2s of the big characters (Bears and Jack) \u00a0and Clive. I still believe this is a good OS (especially if you have dick jab strings like Claudio\u2019s db21 or Leroy\u2019s d124) as long as you pay attention to the distance. The typical GMH mixup for these frames (at least from my experience) are GMH 1 and GMH 4 so keep this in mind to force him to take risks or keep it for clutch situations.\n\n**S2 Update**: Armored heat engagers were the 3^(rd) options but they\u2019re (thankfully) nerfing them. Heat Burst is not viable because GMH attacks, even when successfully armored and converted to chip, deal too much damage.\n\n**D. Most Common Transitions (11d and ff1d on block)**\n\nThe last section is the one I will go into detail the most. These two moves are his most common ways to setup his GMH pressure and are the moves that give people trouble the most.\n\n|Move|Startup|String|On Block (with GMH transition)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|11d|12f|High, Mid|\\+4|\n|ff1d|15f|Mid|\\+4|\n\nOn block, the mix is slightly favored towards Jack so the first step is to not get into this situation as much as possible.\n\n**Move 1: 11d**\n\nStarting with 11d, it is a 12f high mid string. This move is often used as a frame trap after + frame moves like heat burst, GMH 4, and ff3. If you managed to duck the 1st hit, you have to be quick to punish this because the 2^(nd) hit comes out fast.\n\nSo how do I beat it consistently?\n\nIf not transitioned, the move is -14 on block so 99% of the time, Jack players will transition. Fortunately, we have some options to beat this with specific techs.\n\n**Strong Parry -** The second hit of 11 is an elbow so it can\u2019t be parried by your traditional parry. The following characters, however, are the exception as they have a strong parry.\n\n* Reina (Launch punish by cancelling Heaven\u2019s Wrath to WGF2)\n* Jin (Launch Punish)\n* Devil Jin (b1+3 or b2+4 Powercrush)\n* Yoshimitsu (1+2)\n* Raven (Leaves you at -13 so nothing guaranteed. Some GMH options will also reach him even after a successful parry.)\n* Leroy (Perfect Parry if Successful)\n* Bryan (Technically still possible but very hard)\n* Clive (b3)\n\n**Backswing Blow** \u2013 Some characters can also beat this string by doing their evasive panic moves in between the string. If you have one, do lab it out and see if it works.\n\n**Move 2: ff1d**\n\nFf1d is a15f (although is slower due to the ff input) with a guaranteed followup on CH. This is often used mid range gap closer to start his offense. This can sometimes get predictable if the Jack player doesn\u2019t change his timing. It has a bit of tracking on the right so to beat this, **side step left to make it whiff.**\n\n**On Block Options Selects:**\n\nIf you failed to avoid 11d or ff1 but managed to block it, you still have multiple options to beat most of his stance.\n\n* Side Step Left Block - The best anti-GMH option and becomes even better in S2 with the sidestep updates. You\u2019ll block GMH 1 and 3+4 while making the rest whiff.\n* Generic D4 \u2013 Your \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card to get a read or escape a mix. GMH crouch throw is the only attack you\u2019ll lose to but, again, nobody does unless they specifically have a read.\n* Power Crush \u2013 A bit more rewarding option that only loses to GMH 1+2. Only use if you have life to tank some damage.\n* Throws \u2013 Good to use as a mixup option against GMH 3+4. Will only lose to GMH 4.\n\nI highly recommend mastering SSL as your defensive option or use generic d4s as your reading tool. This will help you with your more rewarding hard reads later as you get a feel of your opponent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfzprv7o41pe1.jpg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb701b0f30b43e610b2c5ec1ffbc50c6fba04ad\n\n# II. Neutral\n\nNow that we covered GMH and GMC, let\u2019s go over how to deal with his preferred range, other ways of dealing damage, and counter plays.\n\n**Part 1: Ranges**\n\nJack has multiple long reaching pokes and punishers mid range. His 2 jab and df1, although 1f slower, cover mid screen ranges that can be used to keep the opponent out and control spacing. His punishers are also extremely good atheavily punish whiffs. If the opponent doesn\u2019t commit, this gives Jack the opportunity to rush in with his WR moves or ff1 and then create a mixup using those frames.\n\nOnce upclose, Jack can play a gorilla playstyle with his GMH pressure or be a poke heavy character mixing his string followups to beat retaliations. Once he loses the advantage, he can steal back his turn with his powercrushes or f2. IMO, we should preferably be up Jack\u2019s face as much as possible. If we know how to deal with GMH, this makes playing his upclose game much easier to play and the only things we need to worry about are his powercrushes and f2. Mid\u00a0 range, we can just play keep out since he can\u2019t step out of the way as long as we make sure it gets blocked of course. His left hand also sticks out so his hurt box is larger compared to others. He\u2019s much more susceptible to getting hit by say, electrics, much more than you realize. High power crushes are also good for intercepting his WR/ff1 moves. Again, he can\u2019t step well so some linear moves (like demon paw) might as well be homing against him. All you need to do is stay within range.\n\n**Part 2: What to Do Upclose, Dealing with Powercrushes/GMH parry, and SSR.**\n\nYour first step is to condition him to stay still and respect your advantage. Up close, fast pokes are very good to use as pressure. Your 10f jabs are very good to start your offense. Jack\u2019s 2 jab is 11f and his df1 is 14f so he can\u2019t contest other generic pokes. db1, despite its animation, doesn\u2019t high crush so he\u2019ll have to commit to other risky high crushing options. This will force him to either do f2 or GMH to get you off.\n\nF2 is a 10f high but is -12 on block and linear to side step right. This will often be used when you\u2019re at a slightly negative frame advantage as a hard read get off me tool. After you\u2019ve done your pokes, sidestepping to the right will beat f2 as well as many other poking tools.\n\nGMH parry (3+4) is the other common anti-pressure tool. He can\u2019t sidestep easily so GMH parry is his best way to deal with offense. **He can also do it from crouching**. The parry starts at **7f** so if you\u2019ve memorized your frame data, you can frame trap him around those frames. Besides that, it\u2019s a power crush so throws are a good way to beat them. Lows also work well extremely well but try to use moves that are -13 on block only. At -14, he has ws24 but below that, he has FC df41 as his 12-13f ws punisher but the input is extremely awkward to do so. Realistically, the only punish you\u2019ll get 99% of the time is just a ws4. Plus, he doesn\u2019t have a fast low crush move and can\u2019t step either. High crushing lows are even better because they cover GMH and f2 at the same time. Cancans are premium lows that beat his lows, throws, and powercrushes. \u00a0\n\nEarlier I recommended fast pokes as your offense. This is because you recover fast enough to still block or attack if Jack manages to absorb an attack with GMH. The mixup is usually between a screw launcher GMC1 or a guard break high GMC2. You can guess between the high or mid but these 2 moves can still be parried or sabakied if you recover in time and you can do so if you\u2019ve stuck with your fast pokes. Once you\u2019ve recovered, immediately do your punch parries to counter.\n\n**Part 3: Throws**\n\nJack\u2019s throw game is one of the best in the game. He has a complete command grab and as a bonus, many of his throws trigger stage interactions. Here are all his possible throws that trigger stage interactions if successful.\n\nThrows\n\n|Throw|Break|Trigger|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|qcf 1|1|Floor Interaction|\n|db 2+3|2|Floor Interaction|\n|db,n,f 1+2|1+2|Floor Interaction|\n|uf 1+2|1+2|Floor Interaction|\n|uf 1+2,d,df 2|1+2|Wall Interaction|\n|d 1+3|Crouch Throw (Unbreakable)|Floor Interaction|\n\nUnfortunately for new players, the best counter play for this is to learn how to throw break. There are plenty of resources online on how to break throws but here are the ones that I recommend.\n\n* [https://throwbreak420.web.app/](https://throwbreak420.web.app/) by u/DCEP \u2013 An online tool you can use to practice throws whether you\u2019re procrastinating at work, school, or whatever. Best used on PC but also works on mobile.

Character Dependent Stuff to Keep in Mind\n\n**Wall Combos**\n\nJack is a big character so you can open some combo routes not available to regular sized characters. Kazuya, for example, can get an uf4444 wall combo against Jack but not against small characters like Reina or Leroy. This is character dependent so you\u2019ll have to research these routes on your own. Fortunately, a lot of this information can already be found online so check the discord servers on the sidebar for your character or search your combo routes on youtube.\n\n**Punishing Push Back Moves**\n\nThe last thing vs this matchup is punishing Jack\u2019s push back moves. Many of his power moves go unpunished because on block, the pushback is too big to consistently punish. Many of them are extremely powerful so you can\u2019t just let them get away with it every time. Lab your punish vs these tools on block:\n\n|Move/String|Startup|Property|On Block|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|B1+2|14f|Mid (Heat Engager)|\\-19|\n|D1+2|27f|Mid (Launcher)|\\-18|\n|GMH f1/1+4,1/HCFdf1|17f/20f/20f|Mid (Launcher)|\\-17|\n|Df1212|14f|Mid, High, High, High|\\-18|\n|ff2|18f|Mid (Launcher)|\\-16|\n|FC d1+2,1+2|14f|Low, Mid (KND)|\\-18|\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9asdneh851pe1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38a816fecad4d95179eb8cdedfd94659b581d409\n\n# IV.

If he\u2019s doing it from far away and is approaching you, power crush.|\n|CH KND > Guaranteed ff3/GMH3 > b1+2|Ff3/GMH 3 are usually guaranteed after some CH KNDs. B1+2 will catch standing wake ups.|Side roll and punish the whiffed b1+2.|\n|2,1,1+2 > Windup Upper|If the last hit of 2,1,1+2 hits, windup upper beats a lot of wake up options.|Tap up to block windup upper and punish.|\n|1+3 (broken) > GMH 3+4, GMH 4, BT jabs, or another throw|Visually the ugliest setup in the game. After the 1+3 is broken, Jack goes into BT but you don't. Jack can GMH and absorb follow ups but BT. GMH 3+4 has a 360 hitbox so he still hits you if it touches. If you block and but he has heat, he can do heat dash to immediately turn around. GMH 4 allows Jack to rocket his ass away from you. Besides his GMH shit, he can do throws to turn him around and jabs to beat your attacks.|1+3 is only 0 if you break it. BT jabs have 8f startup and throws have a 12f start up. Generic d4 will beat everything but I usually back dash first to see if they know the set up then do the appropriate counter play for more damage. Throw Jack to beat GMH and back dash and punish the whiff for anything else.|\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f1h9s5kb51pe1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b697b17645e69a7e6aa0ec493f237c796ee2801c\n\n# Summary/TLDR\n\n* Learning to beat GMH is key to this matchup. Pay attention to whatever move he uses to transition to GMH as your option selects vary depending on the move. Once you\u2019ve dealt with this stance, his neutral game is the only thing you\u2019re ever going to worry about.\n* Pressure him up close and mind your spacing patient mid range. He can\u2019t step so he\u2019ll have a hard time dealing with pokes and linear moves resorting to panic buttons to defend.\n* Jack has bad panic buttons, and relies on moves like f2, ub1+2 and stance when he's under pressure, which can be punished. Lows and throws are great to throw out to beat powercrushes. He doesn\u2019t have fast low crush options and can\u2019t step them. For f2 and other pokes, \u00a0SSR.\n* Practice your throw breaks. He has a complete throw game in his arsenal and most of them lead to a stage interaction.\n* Some of his power moves go unpunished because of the push back on block. Lab your punishes and don\u2019t let him get away with it.\n\n# My Thoughts on Jack for S2:\n\nMany of his key moves deal chip damage and they stack up quickly which can unexpectedly lead to closing rounds quickly. For example, if you block this entire sequence in heat (ss2d > GMH 4 > b1+2 heat dash), it takes up 38 points of chip damage and still leaves Jack at +5. If you ate a db1 after, that\u2019s more than a quarter of your total HP gone just from stand blocking. The reduction of chip damage is a significant (but necessary IMO for the state of the game) nerf for Jack. Besides this, GMH 3+4 may no longer be a heat engager based on the Tekken Talk demo (not confirmed yet though).\n\nThe last notable thing to adjust is the sidestep adjustment. 11d forces crouch on block so you can now SSL in any side vs this string. The ease of buffer also helps with consistency especially after 11d and ff1. GMH 4 sometimes track my sidesteps even though I stepped correctly so the patch helps a lot.\n\n# Notable Tournament Players\n\n* JoeCrush\n* Anakin\n* Joey Fury\n* Saint\n* Meo-Il",
