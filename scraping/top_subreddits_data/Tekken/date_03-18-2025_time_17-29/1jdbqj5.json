My dude this game is currently nothing but a massive mashfest, too much tracking on too many attacks that shouldn't track at all even when correctly sidestepping. Overall Balancing issues. Movement issues. Netcode issues. Forced 50/50s. Ranked pointing system is flawed as hell. Yoshi. Nina. Kuma. Alisa. Xiaoyu. Heat system being unbalanced. \n\nPlaying this game can feel like being in a toxic relationship at times. I seriously wanna love the game but every i do i feel like it keeps trynna push me away. Anyone who says that this game in it's current state isn't a mess has to either be ignorant or simply not have played this game enough.\n\nThe devs decision to make it so newer players can have a greater chance at winning against veteran players by completely dumbing this game so that the skill they developed over the years is less rewarding and rather rewarding just pressing button mashing over skill is where the issues started. The devs tried to appeal too much to newer audiences for a quick bag that they  almost forgot about what made Tekken such a great fighting game.",

You guys are the one who are toxic. Like actually you are intentionally making it hard on yourself. I had a huge post here telling you why most of those reasons STILL don't explain it --- you just named things that are constantly repeated in youtube videos. But I killed it because, who gives a fuck. You don't wanna hear that shit anyway.\n\n>The devs tried to appeal too much to newer audiences for a quick bag that they almost forgot about what made Tekken such a great fighting game.\n\nThis is the core reason I think you guys aren't like actually thinking about what you talk about.\n\n**Most** of the changes take a huge amount of care in keeping legacy skill. There are a few losses we ate (law DSS, crouch cancelling to SS into the foreground, and low-highs jailing to name a few) but there are so many things that are carefully, and finely tuned that good players will keep legacy skill going from game to game. \n\nThe example I live to give is electrics; \"easy\" electrics have been added to the game, but they are incapable of replacing regular electrics (you can't launch punish an i35 move with Jin's easy electric) and special style electrics are i18, which is just slow enough that you're better off just trying to wind god fist the normal way to launch punish. So all these newbies get to try using electric in neutral but it's still up to them to put in the hard work to launch a rage art with an electric.\n\nThe whole \"Tracking issues\" is actually like, **classic tekken**. Going back to the zaibatsu forums and you'll see all this shit about people going \"why the fuck does X track like that? why can't i step Y at -z?\" Word for word we've had most of these complaints (especially \"balance issue\") in every Tekken game before this.\n\nThese things have been repeated so often, thaat like, we can use them to identify who wasn't actually good at previous Tekkens. When I see people complaining about the state of balance, I know \"Must be their first Tekken game that they are taking seriously.\"'\n\nBut you guys don't want to hear it. For whatever reason, you would RATHER the blame the game and give fake reasons than ever possibly admit that... this is how tekken always was. You just got your nostalgia goggles on too tight.",

The thing is that you need to earn respect from some people because they\u2019ll be mashing into your big tekken. Luckily Drags small tekken is also really good with moves like df+1 only being -2 whilst other df+1 are -3. His D+2 is another move that applies a small amount of pressure but forces his opponent to play less defensively.\nAnd even if you still want to keep on turtling, and that doesn\u2019t lead him to playing his devastating big tekken chip damage moves; he has a full throw game with feints built into certain throws.\nOn top of that add a decent backswing blow if he wants to catch your small bits of pressure. Drag has a little bit of everything you could want in 8, including big damage numbers from combos.\n\nEven so, I still think Jin is way better. I would even go as far to say that Jin takes less effort than Drag considering Drag sometimes (very important word being sometimes) has to switch to the poking game.",

From that coming problem that if you need to make him A-S tier you need to make his few moves busted. His SNK full steppable with ease. No million hit string that safe or not launch punishable. No safe wallsplat. B4,3 duckable, b4,2 not that much reward, b3 high. Df1,4 not natural. And there is a jin that has every move in the game, but better.\nDrag need wider arsenal more homing moves. His homing mid is 24i startup with almost 0 reward on hit and cH. B3 is good high homing 14i, but -9 smh.\nSo you can decrease of tracking other moves. \n\nFor now drag has low tracking, no homing. Just step and win. Realigning is very risky.\nBtw WR moves cant realign normally idk why",
