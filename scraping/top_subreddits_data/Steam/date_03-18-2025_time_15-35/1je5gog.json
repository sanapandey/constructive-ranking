Basically, I wanted to get everyone who didn't have it a copy of Undertale (it would've cost me around 32 bucks).\n\nNow, every time I try it, Steam tells me there are region differences and that I cannot buy it to friends.\n\nDear Steam: if the product is a different price in their area, LET ME PAY FOR IT. \n\nIf between my region and theirs I have to pay the most expensive price, LET ME PAY FOR IT.\n\nIf there are exchange fees for different currencies, LET ME PAY FOR IT.\n\nThis is ridiculous that we don't even have the choice to do anything short of having to send them the money via Paypal for them to do it on their own. It really ruins the joy of giving. I was only able to send it to 19 of my 30 friends because they live in other countries and I hate that.",

Now you can't, you need an argentinian or Turkish payment method to buy games in argentinian or Turkish accounts.\n\nIf Valve allowed for cross-region gifts, it would invalidate this restriction and bring back the loophole, because you could create an account in these cheaper regions with a VPN and use your local (say, American) payment method to \"gift\" games to this account. \n\nThe only way for cross-region gifts to work without opening the loophole again would be to allow gifts only from more expensive regions to cheaper ones, or having the price be the most expensive one between those regions, as OP suggested, but I don't know how difficult it would be to implement (I don't know how Steam processes payments).",
