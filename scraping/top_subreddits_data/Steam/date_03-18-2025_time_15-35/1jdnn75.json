Marginally so, but when you try doing calculations with integers as percents instead of fractional numbers, your code is statistically more error-prone. The more robust way is to do calculations with real numbers and only apply \"percent\" formatting at the visualisation.\n\nIn this case it would've been simpler to do /20 and /5, but only if you add achievements manually. It is not unfeasible that they probably had a universal achievement class that adapts progress to percentage, so they didn't bother with specifying how it should show progress, and it shows percentage by default. Maybe another reason, inattentiveness, other platforms' requirements or whatever else could that be.",
