Steam Machines were mostly off the market by 2018 while Steam Controller went on at least another year before being discontinued.   I feel they should be two separate entities on that list.  \nWhere is the love for the physical hardware Steam Link that later became mostly an App?  That should be on there too.  That's when Steam Streaming/Remote Play got started, a very important feature on Steam if you ask me.  \nDeadlock probably should be changed to 20XX as there is no guarantee they'll make it a full release in the next 5 years.  \n  \nAnyways, I'm still not a fan of a timeline that isn't flat.  But that's an art is subjective problem, not something you have to fix.",
