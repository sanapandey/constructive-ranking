I'm not sure exactly the severity or whether it persists after the game exits as I just saw other user's reports, but you probably don't want to play a game with such a glaring issue. Who knows what else is wrong with it. Memory leaks can be a red flag for malware, but it could also just be a dumb mistake from the developer.",
