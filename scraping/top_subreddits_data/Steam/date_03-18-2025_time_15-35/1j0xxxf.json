I am trying to buy a steam deck through the steam store since 3 weeks now and I\u2019m close to giving up on it. I am from Germany btw currently living in the us. First I tried to pay with my own credit card which didn\u2019t work because my billing address is not in the same country then my delivery address (which is something I never had a problem with with any other shop I ordered from within the states). Then I used my partner\u2019s credit card which for unknown reasons wouldn\u2019t work either. Lastly yesterday I used a credit card from my partner\u2019s father and was finally able to make the purchase. I received an email that my purchase was successful. Hours later however another email came informing me that my purchase was cancelled without any explanation as to why. On top of that it seems very hard to get a grip on steam customer service making this the one of most frustrating customer service experiences I have ever had. Can anybody tell me what to do to buy a steam deck over the steam store?",

If they suspect they will probably get chargedback for the Steam Deck purchase, they rather want to cancel and refund. For new Steam accounts, Valve even goes as far to lock it out of fraud suspicions. The correct course of action it to switch your store region to your current country of residence + your own credit card.",

When I saw the trade I immediately knew something was up and I had to write this post for help. I am asking for help with this situation since I don't want my account banned or my items stolen. If anybody would like to help me, I can send more screenshots of the whole situation. (The whole trade of conversation with the owner).",

Normally games should synchronize their save data to the Steam Cloud even if they write to the \"userdata\" folder, but it is sadly pretty inconsistent across games. For example, SteamDB [says](https://steamdb.info/app/50300/ufs/) that Spec Ops: The Line does not have Steam Auto-Cloud enabled, but when I checked the account data page on the Steam Support site, save data got actually uploaded. A deceiving case is Ark Survival Evolved, which has Steam Cloud officially enabled, but synchronizes nothing.\n\nBasically the only catch that you need to be aware of is that 1. different games use different save path locations. They are not all inside Steam's \"userdata\", but IMO the \"userdata\" folder tends to be overlooked. And 2. that one should not delete and replace the top-level \"userdata\" folder itself, because Steam uses it for other purposes as well (e.g. for storing locally saved screenshots). But so far your thinking has been reasonable! :)",

As an example, there was one case before (I saw it in such a support thread) where someone was using a drawing tablet for playing CSGO, and later received a VAC ban. Steam Support didn't want to help them but the person believed it was because of them using the drawing tablet.\n\nSadly it's of no use to contact Steam Support for details about the ban, as they won't ever share the details in 99% of the cases, and you can only do so much remotely. But most commonly, look for anything that could interact with the game. For example, in 2023, AMD's Anti-Lag+ caused people [to get banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1770slx/warning_recent_amd_gpu_driver_update_23101_may/) in CSGO. And that was from official driver software. Once you got a solid clue, you might have a slightly better chance to contact Steam about this.",

Since Steam Input support like that has always been inofficial, problems like this one are sadly bound to happen from time to time.\n\nIf you mainly use basic controller functionality, you might want to look into the old GlosSI (global Steam Input) [project](https://github.com/Alia5/GlosSI), which was originally made to help Steam Controllers become usable in any game. Steam Input serves as a translation layers for various other controllers out there (including common Playstation ones), and GlosSI internally uses an emulated Xbox Controller which it sends input to from Steam Input.\n\nAlternatively since your main focus is Fortnite, maybe it works out better to stream it for free from the Xbox Cloud Gaming page, while that free option still exists.",

I'm very curious if anyone has encountered the same and found a solution.\n\nHere are my steps I've gone through so far.\n\n1. Ensure \"Enable Steam input for Xbox controllers\" is enabled in Steam\n2. Install the Xbox Extended Feature Support Driver\n3. Check the controller is detected in Windows \na) Device appears in \"Game Controllers\" via Control Panel \nb) Device appears in Xbox Accessories app \nc) Check device appears in [https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad](https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad)\n\n4. Update controller firmware in Xbox Accessories app\n5. Try multiple USBs (Different headers, ie front IO/rear, USB-A vs USB-C)\n6. Connect controller wirelessly, then plug in controller via USB (controller appears when wireless but disappears once USB is connected)\n7. Check Event Viewer - Nothing at all in there.\n\nSo as you can see, I've given it a fair shot with troubleshooting and am a bit at my wits end. So if anyone has any clues on what could be going on here, I would greatly appreciate the help.\n\nP.S. for context, I am trying to use the controller wired within Monster Hunter Wilds, which does not appear to natively support the controller by bypassing Steam Input, which I have seen with a few games, i.e. Forza Motorsport.",

The two games I'm having issues with are far cry 3 and watch dogs 1. I'll be using watch dogs for my examples as its worse off then farcry but its essentially the same problem. \n\nSo I have my TV set to my default audio output through control panel and opening the game in any window mode will allow sound to play but exclusively through the built in laptop speakers, ignoring default output. Disabling the laptop speakers made the game stop playing audio all together. I found a fix for this by changing sound settings for TV speakers from 16 bit to 24 bit 4800hz (this wasnt needed in farcry). This allows the game audio to play through the TV speakers but only in Windowed/borderless. Alt+enter into fullscreen will stop the audio until the game is closed even going back into windowed mode doesn't restore sound. No matter what I do sound will not play in fullscreen mode at all through the TV speakers, now if I enter fullscreen mode then exit the game, I can briefly see a red x over the taskbars sound button, that when clicked will bring up troubleshooting. Each game did play sound via TV in fullscreen mode a single time, which was the first time I disabled laptop speakers, but not since. I haven't had sound problems like this on any other game I own, closest is gta v but that simply requires exiting and entering fullscreen to resolve. My drivers are up to date however, they did stop receiving updates a while ago.\n\nI have search for hours for both games and have not found a solution for this despite multiple posts that are experiencing the same problem.",

I've pushed back and asked that they continue to look into those files and give me better information. \n\nI'm HOPING Steam support can give me a better answer in the future but I was wondering: Is there precedence for customers who lose the ability to play a game because of issues (seemingly) out of their control?

Im trying to refund a game that i played like 8+hours because i want to 100% it and didn't know at that time that you need the dlc that's more expensive and very short than the base game (it's Lost Judgment if anyone is wondering). What are my chances that my refund request is accepted ? I have to get spoiled first to know that the game has the dlc achievement and since im on a mission to 100%ing the series i thought maybe i can get a refund and buy other rgg titles that doesn't requires any dlc to complete",

I bought Hearts of Iron 4 today since Paradox is having a sale. I enjoy these strategy type games (800+ hours in EU4) so i thought of giving this game a try. I went through the tutorial, watched a quick guide on youtube and played for a bit before realizing the game isn\u2019t for me. Tried asking for a refund and it got denied.\n\nThe reason? I had a friend family share the game back in 2016 (never bought the game), almost 9 years ago, and I played for almost 30hours. It doesn\u2019t matter that I bought the game at 5pm and asked for a refund before 7pm same day, and had about an hour of in-game time. Its funny that they even include my purchase date, like it would be possible to play over 29h in one day. https://imgur.com/a/78t1pxO\n\nI tried explaining the issue when I submitted a refund request bur it seems to be getting declined within 1 hour\n\nAny advice on how to get a refund, or reach out to someone at Steam that can actually read what I wrote in the refund comments?",

Its not 2 hours since purchase (which could be exploited if you could buy refund then buy again and get a whole new counter) but 2 hours played on the account.\n\nYou are almost certainly out of luck with 30 hours played.\n\nSometimes using the \"I have a question about this purchase\" can get you another look after a denied refund but honestly with 30 hours I probably wouldn't even bother trying that as odds are super low to be an exception to the 2 hour rule with that many hours and simply not liking the game as the reason for the refund attempt.",

Play the game with\u00a0**only the Essential Pack**\u00a0(her own account, starting fresh).\n   2. Play using my\u00a0**Family Shared**\u00a0version, but without the new DLCs we just bought.\n* We tried to\u00a0**refund the purchase on her account**, but Steam\u00a0**auto-rejected**\u00a0it immediately because she has\u00a0**132+ hours**\u00a0on record (even though the new DLCs have less than 30 mins of playtime). No way to talk to a real person either.\n\nI really\u00a0**don\u2019t want to double-buy**\u00a0all the DLCs again just to fix this. Is there\u00a0**any way to transfer, cancel, or partially refund**\u00a0the purchase? Or a way to actually contact Steam support and explain the situation?\n\nTL;DR: Bought ETS2 + Essential Pack on my wife's account (where she always played via Family Sharing). Now we realized\u00a0**DLCs don\u2019t mix**, and Steam\u00a0**won\u2019t refund**\u00a0due to playtime history. Stuck between two incomplete versions of the game.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",
