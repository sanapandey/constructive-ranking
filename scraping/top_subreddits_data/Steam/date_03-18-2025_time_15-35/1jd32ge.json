It's up to Valve if they want to go ham on quality control when it comes to games. That's what Steam Greenlight was supposed to be for, well kinda, it was mainly because of their limited capacity but now you can get hard drives with dozens of terabytes of storage. They put their foot down for Crypto and NFT shit. So they can do the same for asset flips and games made generally for a quick buck. Steam is getting a surge of virus games lately which would put them in a bad spot to do something, like quality control. \n\n\"Out of sight, out of mind\" seems like it's a horrible attitude but that's all we can do unless we pull a #FixTF2 move but Steam quality control kind of crap. Which the easiest way imo would be the same thing as Steamdeck verified but for quality made games that the community/Steam deems worth having. We got the tools to help it ourselves, but to permanently do something, it's up to Valve",

Limit games that have access to steam inventory and trading to games verified by Valve. \nThird? Take user reports seriously. Right now you can report plenty of shit and Valve just pisses the reports away.\nFourth and onward? Investigate heavily negative reviewed games. If a game is sitting at a 80% negative review rating for 6 months, chances are its not a good game on the platform. Investigate when a game is predominantly sold through activation keys. Investigate how often a game goes on sale and how much, so shit like above doesnt happen. Remove EA game, or fully release games that havent had an update in more than a year. \n\nThats just shit i came up with off the top of my head, certainly the most popular, profitable storefront for PC gamning can muster up some better ideas. \n\n>so why no leave it up to the users to decide on whether they want to buy it or not?\n\nBecause its slop that gets in the way of *genuine* games.

Valve having quality control! \n\n>This is where part of the \"taste police\" issue comes in. Further limitations to getting a game on Steam will absolutely prevent a number of the small indie developers from being able to release their game on Steam. People would often complain that their favourite niche game couldn't get enough votes on Greenlight.\n\nHowso?\nIf an indie developer wants their **actual** game on steam, they submit it to valve. Valve approves because its an actual game. \nScam developer of \"5000 achievement game 100% click now\", doesnt get approval. Simple as that.\n\n>There already are limitations to the profile features. All of the games from OP's screenshot are limited. Sure, currently it's limited based on sales/profit, but then that leaves the decision to users to buy the game - if the game is not popular, then the profile features are limited as we see with these.\n\nAs I said, this doesnt stop the massive amount of trading card and steam inventory spam. \nIts like you completely ignored my comment.\n\n>Well, when the current rules allow these, what do you expect the user reports to do? And again, the taste police issue.\n\nActually, according to Valves rules, no. Just that they dont enforce their rules. If a game has broken achievements for example, it isnt permitted on steam. Know what happens when you report a game known for having broken achievements?\nNothing!\n\n>Why does it matter if a game with negative reviews are on Steam?\n\nWe are talking about Valve implementing quality control, and you are asking would negative reviews matter. \n\nThink long and hard about that.\nIf a game has a bunch of valid negative reviews, probably means that game is of poor quality, doesnt work, etc and *shouldnt be sold on the platform*.\n\n>Valve already has limitations on frequency of sales to prevent abuse.\n\nRead that comment again.\n\nAnd no, there is not enforcement of these rules and limitations. See: above, or GTA V going on a super sale for a split second, then to the usual sale price. \n\n>Scams currently get removed\n\nNot really lol\n\n> I just did a few queues and only had a couple of really low-effort games.\n\nSo... you *given* evidence of the problem, ignore it/dont think its bad, then act like theres no problem?\n\nAlright then lol.",

Or it would accept to distribute some indie games but not other ones, and nobody could figure out what you were supposed to do to please Valve so that they would distribute you. Valve was accused of \"gatekeeping\", boosting certain games or developers they liked, while holding other ones back. That sort of thing.\n\nValve did not enjoy making the call of what to publish or not. They didn't want to allow everything onto the platform, but they didn't want everyone giving them sh\\*\\* for not allowing games onto the platform either.\n\nSo they tried out Steam Greenlight for a while, which was an interesting experiment, but it had its own problems and didn't take into account certain developer concerns. Tbh gamers online are often dumb and angry and don't know what they're talking about.\n\nThis system was replaced by Steam Direct, in which most games that want to get published do get published, as long as they meet certain requirements. Valve DOES do a certain amount of quality control to make sure e.g. they aren't selling you spyware or bitcoin miners. But valve doesn't care if you think Bad Rats is a quality game or not.\n\nThis developer is engaging in the ancient practice of shovelware. Valve does take steps to try and stop the kind of shenanigans this person is engaged in, but whatever steps they take, they have to make sure they're not hurting innocent devs at the same time. This is an arms race at the end of the day.\n\nThis is clearly annoying, but it's just ignorant to suggest Valve does nothing, has no plan, and doesn't care. I know it's annoying, but things are more complicated than that.",

They *used* to care about quality of their platform and games but full on stopped around ~2014/15 \n\nPeople *loved* steam greenlight. Problem is, valve auyomated it towards the later half of its life cycle, which just resulted in bad actors botting their asset flips and kickstarter scams which got accepted but genuine indie games didnt.\n\nSo in turn valve just opened the flood gates. Hell, it was one of the things that made Jimquisition so popular because she would showcase the massive amount of slop being released and Valve doing nothing about it.\n\nLets not forget the games that were a bit miner, one that used the steam inventory feature to literally scam people, speculation games like Banana and Egg, purposefully offensive games, and the the droves of shovel ware made soley for card farming all allowed on steam no question asked.\n\nNow personally, if I had a storefront that I was proud of, I wouldnt just allow a product to be sold just because the seller gave me $100 and a single exe file, but I also have standards. Unlike valve.\n\n>Valve does take steps to try and stop the kind of shenanigans this person is engaged in,\n\nThey genuinely dont.\nThey just recently made the choice to add a line of text that tells if an EA game has been updated recently.
