Shoving it into older games and ruining their lighting and art styles for these weird tech demos that barely run on high end hardware without the fake bullshit is mind-boggling and nothing but advertising.\n\nDLSS and framegen and all that shit is a plague - it looks like shit every time, the fake frames are incredibly obvious, and the input lag is horrendous. And nowadays everything just relies so heavily on them to hit remotely playable framerates on high-end hardware. It's disgusting.\n\nWhen done right, ray tracing can look good - Cyberpunk is a great example. But it performs so terribly that it's almost never worth using, unless you want to muddy it up with all the other garbage.",
