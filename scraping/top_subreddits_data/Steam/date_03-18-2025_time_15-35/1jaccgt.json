No Valve employee will ever speak to you directly through chat on Steam, Discord or anywhere else. They will only talk to you via [a support ticket](https://help.steampowered.com/en/), and there's no such thing as a Steam Admin.\n\n[**Secure your account**](https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/wiki/secureyouraccount) and [**educate yourself on scams!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/wiki/scamtypes)\n\n[Is your account hijacked?

Why? What do I do?\n\n**A:** There is nothing you can do to accelerate this process, you must wait it out.\n\nSales or purchases on the [Steam Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/) can be held for up to 5 days, this is an automatic process and occurs when a sale or purchase had an unusual price that deviates from the average price on the item or the system determines that a hijacked account or bad actor may have been involved in the transaction.\n\n---\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n##A few related Subreddits you might find useful:\n\n[/r/SteamOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamOS)\n\n[/r/SteamGrid](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGrid)\n\n[/r/SteamDeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck)\n\n[/r/GameDeals](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals)\n\n[/r/Steam_Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam_Link)\n\n[/r/SteamDeals](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeals)\n\n[/r/SteamFriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamFriend)\n\n[/r/GameScreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameScreens)\n\n[/r/GameDetectives](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedetectives/)\n\n[/r/SteamController](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController)\n\n[/r/TipOfMyJoyStick](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick)\n\n[/r/Steam_Giveaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/steam_giveaway/)\n\n[/r/SteamTradingCards](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamTradingCards)\n\n[/r/GamingSuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions)\n\n[/r/FreeGamesOnSteam](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGamesOnSteam/)\n\n[/r/ShouldIBuyThisGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIBuyThisGame)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n#Please read this entire post before you make a comment.\n\n#**Enjoy the sale everyone!**",

Different guns and items have synergies with others and you can find some absolutely broken combos. You unlock other characters and each character has a past that you must kill.

You could probably beat the first game three times in the time it takes to beat 2. The story for 2 requires no prior knowledge.",

Unlike most other MMOs, GW2 has zero maintenance downtime but if you buy on Steam you'll be booted out during Steam's Tuesday maintenance or any other time it goes down.\n\nYou can still play the game through Steam with a standalone account by adding \"-provider Portal\" to the launch args - I'm literally playing it on my Steam Deck that way right now.",

So, assuming DS goes -50% again, I'll spend the remaining 30 on (older) titles that are dirt cheap.

Weekly challenges/daily challenges, constant events, pvp boss battles, and raids.  The freedom to actually have any kind of build. \n\nWanna be a drugged out alcoholic junkie? Go ahead, what to be a team player while doing it? Take Quack surgeon to revive people with alcohol. \n\nWanna go in flaming dual blade chainsaw?? And eat the cut-up body afterwards go ahead. Yes, of course, there is a meta in the game. But if you pick it up for 10$ and just play the main story/wastelander, then do the skyline valley you'll  hit about 25-30 hours. \n\nIt also has the nicest community I've ever seen. Constantly giving new players things. Active devs who play the game and are super active in the sub and listen to feedback. I have the platinum sitting at about 400h.
