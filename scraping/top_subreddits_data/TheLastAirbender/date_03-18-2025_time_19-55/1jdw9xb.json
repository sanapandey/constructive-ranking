    "selftext": "Everything about it is perfect, the soundtrack that fits a villain more than a hero, the angles they use to show the grandeur of the bendings, the way Aang creates his sphere of the four elements, how Aang practically breaks the laws of physics, compressing the earth and water tgat much, all of this gives an idea of how immense the Avatar's power is, he is practically a deity. This scene, while triumphant, is also kind of scary, I've had this feeling since I was a child, the whole construction of the scene brings a feeling of cosmic terror or something similar.",

Don\u2019t think he personally could pull all this off, the sheer mastery of all four elements at once, but if Aang truly wanted to he could have spent a decent amount of time mastering the avatar state then made a B line for the fire nation and wiped them off the map in a few hours comet or eclipse\n\nHe didn\u2019t because both his job and personal wish was for peace. He truly wanted to make a better world and did his absolute best to do as he could",

Where when you first see it from the \u201cpathetic\u201d attempt, then his slightly more fierce one, then Ozai\u2019s roar of power, finally for the avatar state roar. Like you can see the difference in power put into it where the roars are a show of that power, only for Aang to have one loud enough to sound like a monster.",

I get that it\u2019s a magic system and not everything is supposed to make sense or be explainable, but liquid water literally cannot compress like that. You can add enough pressure that it\u2019ll freeze into a special kind of ice, but it won\u2019t meaningfully compress.",
