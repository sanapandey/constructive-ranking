Feeling she had to \"control\" those she was close with much like Ozai had done with her. Not healthy or acceptable at the end of the day but she wouldn't have broken down as hard as she did when Mai/Ty Lee betrayed her had she not cared for them.",

Azula must be completely loyal to him; he molded her to be his perfect weapon, so she must be under his control. The most effective method he uses is a combination of emotional abuse, making her believe that if she were perfect and met all his expectations, he would love her, and putting her on a pedestal (you're worth more than everyone else, you're a prodigal...) to isolate her as much as possible from everyone. This is combined with the fact that her relationships are viewed through the prism of \"what can she bring me?\" because of this upbringing. He also sets Zuko and Azula against each other by using Zuko to show Azula what will happen to her if she isn't 100% with him, but also by giving Zuko his crown prince status to leave Azula in limbo.\n\n\n\nIt's all about upbringing and socialization. Azula's primary and secondary socialization are flawed and bad. So yes, she does things that, from our perspective, are bad, but from her perspective.",

If she was that bad to them why wouldn't they hunt her down in the comics only tylee is going after her.",

At the point she recruits him, she has already captured the Dai Li and knows she has the Avatar within reach. She recruits him before the battle with the Gaang so she doesn\u2019t know Zuko will be critical in that fight.\n\nAt this point Zuko is a fugitive and her orders are to capture him and return him as a prisoner. Instead she recruits him and fights the avatar with him, and gives him credit for killing Aang.\n\nWhich means she takes the risk of going against Ozai\u2019s orders in order to bring him back, and gives him the glory of getting the Avatar as well. I don\u2019t see why she would do this if she doesn\u2019t care for Zuko. It makes no sense to me why she wouldn\u2019t just mop them all up and take the glory for herself. Especially considering Azula\u2019s main motivation is getting the approval of her fatherz",

When Mei and Ty Lee fought against her at the prison in season 3, Azula, even though cruel, is still surprised and hurt, even saying, \"No, you should have feared me more!\" Maybe in her way, she is reaching out and expressing her feelings of betrayal from someone she trusted and even cared about in some way. But a lot of how she shows care was taught by Ozai, who obviously never showed any true form of care or love ever. Idk what point I'm trying to make, but those are my thoughts, at least.",
