I think the sheriff was a fairly direct analogy to towns like that, where the sheriffs often have a lot of power, they're wary of outsiders, and the town tends to glorify the days of the Confederacy.",

Lee and Jefferson Davis.\n\nI wouldn't say the writers were trying for perfect analogies, of course, though there are a number of neo-confederate paramilitary militias as well. I think the Sheriff's triad connection was just thrown in as a convenient plot device to enable his murder of Naoki without his direct involvement, and to explain why they believed it was a triad mugging for so long.\n\nAs for the Agni Kais, they just seem like an ordinary gang/mafia to me. Many do have a strong degree of ethnic exclusivity (ie. gangs and mafias don't usually recruit members from other ethnic groups), but usually aren't ideological like neo-nazis are. That said, the triads haven't really been explored very much.",

Their naming themselves after a grueling dueling system that scarred a ruler they hate would make sense.",

I also didn't expect Pakku's sexist angle to show up. But Mako used lightningbending! That's something. Even though the following conversation between him and the villain guy sidesteps the whole thing despite a fairly relevant story being in there. I guess Mako thought it was too awkward to reveal he learned lightning generation from a mob boss who took him in from the streets.",
