Only Kyoshi never took political history class and never thought what would happen to the Dai Li once she wasn\u2019t around anymore to lead the group, which resulted in them becoming the most corrupt organization within Ba Singe Se shortly after her death.\n\nI believe there\u2019s a comic where she directly tells Aang that had she realized what they would become by his era she never would have created them.",
