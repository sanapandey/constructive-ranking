            "body": "[Realms Collide](https://avatarrealmscollide.com/) is a strategy game featuring characters from different eras of the avatar universe. It received a limited release in some countries last year, but will soon expand to other regions. In a recent [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyrcNOai-PA) (featuring Michaela Murphy) it was revealed that the U.S release date is March 18th. Additionally staff of the game have confirmed it will release elsewhere on the 18th and 19th (including some European countries)  but I don't have a specific list.\n\n[https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar:\\_Realms\\_Collide](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar:_Realms_Collide)",
