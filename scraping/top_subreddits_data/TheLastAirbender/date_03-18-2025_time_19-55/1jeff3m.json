He grew up in a family a female characters. His dad is always busy trying to rebuild the Air Nomads and Republic City. Maybe along the way, at 3ish, he decided to be fully a male figure. You can see how he displays common perceptions about being a boy.\n\nSo seeing Katara and being hugged by her, he could have felt an uncomfortable sense of affection and reacted an icky response.\n\nThat is just my two cents.",
