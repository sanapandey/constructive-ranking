The way the entire business model is structured means you've got all these competing packages, some with bundles, some without...We were spoiled by tech VC giving us consumers a product that wasn't remotely sustainable (ad-free, unlimited-sharing Netflix with few other streaming app competitors) just long enough for it to become a standard we all relied on, then switching things up to make it shitty (radically higher costs, ads, password sharing limitations, media quality tiers, dozens of options, etc.) for the user. \n\nMy main issue is that none of these platforms have more than a couple shows I watch (aside from Netflix, which has many). And there's no bundle option that allows you a certain number of shows from each platform lol. Off the top of my head, I only watch 1 show on Hulu, 2 on Max (one of which is now done), 2 or 3 on Paramount Plus, 1 or 2 on Peacock...shows I really want to watch/keep up with, but I can't justify paying full sticker price for the service just to get access to 1-3 shows, and it's not financially sensible for the services to offer limited plans that only get you access to certain shows. And starting and canceling plans across so many major platforms repeatedly throughout the year is a pain in the ass lol.\n\nI'm quite capable at sailing the seven seas to find the media I want, but even then, I feel bad because I want my viewing reflected in the streaming services' data, so that these shows keep getting renewed etc.",
