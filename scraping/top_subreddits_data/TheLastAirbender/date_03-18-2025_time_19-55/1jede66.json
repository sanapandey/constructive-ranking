Nothing in the choreography screams \"wall\" to me. They're pointing towards the single earth bender and the direction the rock is traveling. The shot is framed to imply that's what's happening. These guys bending the wall makes more sense on paper but it feels like a fan theory when looking at the actual scene. So many bizarre choices in this film.\n\nI'm also still baffled that the prison plot even made its way into the film. If you're going to condense book 1 into a single movie, you don't need the prison plot at all. You especially don't need to half ass it and remove its emotional impact.",

This scene with the earthbenders might have been the hardest I\u2019ve ever laughed in a movie theater. \n\nAfter that, I rewatched the original cartoon for the first time since it ended two years earlier. I got my little sister to watch it with me, who was a bit too young to watch it when it was on the air. Then I showed her the movie so she could see how ridiculous it was.",

Some firebenders are trying to blast some folks who are then surprisingly saved by a large wall appear before them. Those folks turn, in surprise, and look at the six earthbenders from this clip. Then the small rock moves forward towards a different earthbender, who makes a motion to shoot it at the initial firebenders.\n\nThe whole thing is poorly shown, and if you were to just be shown a 3 second clip, you'd come to the wrong conclusion, but it's pretty clear in the context of the full scene, which I posted above.\n\nDo you disagree with that interpretation of the scene? I guess the six earthbenders are moving the small rock toward the seventh earthbender as a weird combo move, but then it doesn't answer where the initial earth wall came from.\n\nAs for calling OP a manipulative liar, mea culpa. I strongly believe that they would've posted the whole clip (which is bad start to finish) if they had believed that it had taken not six, but SEVEN earthbenders to move that turd of a rock. As is, it just seems manipulative. I'm not gonna apologize for calling a liar a liar.",

The original show was damn near perfect story-wise, so there wasn't much room for them to improve on it. You've got to watch the Netflix show through the mindset that they're telling a *different* story and not trying to just mirror the original 1:1.\n\nThe differences start to come into play when they get to Omashu. They cut up two or three different episodes of the cartoon, and mash them together in a way that actually felt fresh imo. \n\nThey're not trying to cram the whole show's events into one summer, which I think makes a lot more sense. Leaves more time to build relationships for characters like Suki and Yue. I personally don't regret my time watching the show like I do with the movie, and I'm interested to see what they do in the next season. I'd say it's worth a watch, so long as you don't expect the original show lol",
