Great responsibility and all that. So I think people who don't value empathy and kindness hate those kinds of shows and characters because all they feel is annoyance at something they don't understand. Possibly can't. Which is sad.",

But a better version of what his past selves did, one still tempered by his dedication to his people's morals.

The entirety of the world of ATLA(with a few exceptions) operates on a fundamentally different moral grounding than the real world. It is a war torn(if slightly censored by the writers) setting. We see tragedies like the 41st or prison camps like where the earth benders are held.\n\n\nSeeing Aang not fit with that established moral sentiment can sometimes feel unnatural. This, I also think, is what the writers meant to do. Aang IS unnatural. He is the remnant of the pacifist people - the airbenders.\u00a0\n\n\nThe only problem being, we never get to know that culture, so when other characters(like sokka) make great points about having to kill the fire lord, some people accept it as keeping with the moral character of the world - Aang being the one who is incorrect.\u00a0\n\n\nThat feeling of being morally correct in our world but morally dubious in the world of ATLA is where the disconnect happens. Aang is moral, and good. The world he lives in isn't. Some people think that the main character should fit the setting instead of being the lone exception.",

They set up a moral choice between saving the world and maintaining the memory of the airbenders. But they didn\u2019t know how to resolve it so they added an asspull about energy bending. They wanted their massive fight of good versus evil but lost the moral plot. In the end there is still a slight support for the idea that \u2018might makes right.\u2019 Ozai lost his might \u2018bending\u2019 therefore he lost his right \u2018legitimacy\u2019 to be fire lord.\n\nAang at his best was when he \u2018fought\u2019 Zhou on the river. He was a pacifist but he as clever and used Zhou\u2019s aggression against him. I would have loved if instead of an isolated canyon. Aang had challenged Ozai in the center of the fire nation and fought in a way that delegitimized Ozai. Ozai\u2019s lack of control and wanton destruction would be unleashed on his own people and he loses legitimacy just as his son returns with the avatar preaching peace and reconciliation. That way Aang\u2019s story isn\u2019t over shadowed by the Agni Kai it\u2019s enhanced by it, all of the elements of Aang\u2019s victory exist in the story from the beginning and the airbender\u2019s way of life process itself ultimately victorious over the fire nation.",
