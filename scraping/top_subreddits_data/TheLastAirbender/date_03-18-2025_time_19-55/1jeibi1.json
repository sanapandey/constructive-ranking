One of my favourite fight scenes in any animated show.\n\nObviously the story and character development in S2 are phenomenal and a big step up from S1. But this really shows the power development of the Gaang in an awesome way.\n\nFrom a kid who couldn't even waterbend, and a girl who could only throw water backwards, to a crack Special Ops team of pro benders who can lay siege to a palace and an army by themselves and win easily.\n\nAlso the show just gets more and more inventive with bending as it goes on. Flattening the stairs into a ramp and making an Earthbending escalator is soooooo frickin cool.",

Pitching your idea for a battle plan to your close friends involving a handful of people is much different from creating one for an entire army, and pitching said idea to a crowd mostly made up of people much older and more experienced in battle that you've grown up admiring. I don't think the later freakout would be out of place with this added.\n\nI fully agree it would've been cool to see him plan this attack. Especially if he *did* freak out a little about taking the lead because it's usually been Aang up to that point (I think? Been awhile since I watched it tbh).",
