Then there are smaller-scope decisions made by a reasonably-sized team of people named writers, which are more open to criticism.\n\nTenzin made a wise choice to embrace the fact that revitalizing Air Nomads as they had been right before the genocide was unrealistic because of how the world had changed in the intervening 270 years. Fighting back against that sort of change was going to be a lot of effort for little payoff.\n\nAang made a wise choice to reject the goals of four narcissists (Sozin, Azula, Ozai, and Azula) who envisioned a world purged of diversity and ruled by an autocrat. That was something he could realistically (and literally) combat, especially since two of the four were already dead by the time he woke up from the iceberg.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to finish my thought: I don\u2019t think criticizing the decisions of the writers is inherently a rejection of the show\u2019s messages and themes. If you love something, having criticism is a sign that you want it to be even better. The decisions made in LOK and in Seven Havens aren\u2019t some inevitable things that always had to be this way. A different voice in that writer\u2019s room could have led to a much different outcome.",

I can even accept the Avatar, directly or indirectly, causing the potentially world ending disaster. Again, we saw that in the original show. What I cannot accept is, potentially, 2 Avatars. That completely breaks the rules of this world.  \n\nI love the original series and I like LoK well enough, but I question the justification for making more shows. To me, this all feels like money grab because they know the fan base will watch this because of the nostalgia factor. I honestly probably won't watch it for a long while. Partially because I don't have TV or Netflix, but also because I am happy with how both ATLA and LoK ended that I don't want to watch this world die.",
