My oldest son 4 1/2 years old drew a majestic picture of a bull this morning, 30 seconds later an Abercrombie & Fitch commercial goes on. Put 2 and 2 together and we have...\n\nCALLS on ANF.\n\n2. My youngest son almost 2, I got a picture from his daycare with him posing in a bear onesie. He is officially the stinkiest ber alive, 2 minutes later scrolling WSB sub i see a picture of Elon and McGregor posing at the Whitehouse.\n\nPUTS on TSLA, now I've already been doing this but now the position will get fucking increased.\n\nSee, no charts requires today, this is solid enough DD.\n\nNow upvote me you sexy regards, because whether we are right or wrong we have each other and we love it![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)",

How large are the ramifications for the rest of the market?    \n\nNext stop on this train of thought: was Tesla's stock propped up by the value of bitcoin this whole time, not only as an individual company, but because the cost of putting Tesla in it's proper place means severely mispricing several other companies?    \n\nP.S.

Then it dropped with some volume.  \nThe insiders have sold a part of their shares which were restricted stock and had to be converted to ordinary before the privatization.  \nAs it is referred in the SEC filings:  \n\"These shares were sold by the reporting person to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock units and were not discretionary transactions by the reporting person.\"  \nTherefore I don't see any problem to the procedure. In March 20th the annual results will be out and an update.  \nSo you can buy now below $5 and make more than 40% in a few weeks, by selling at $7.30.  \nThe risks are:  \nThe insiders may cancel the deal, despite it is in its late stages. Why to pay $7.33 in this market if they believe they can pay $5 a couple of months later?  \nThe sponsors of the deal contribute $30 million. They may withdraw their funds due to the extra bearish market.  \nThe deal for some unknown reason could be delayed one or two months.",

Folks are trying to disrupt that (rightly or wrongly).  That makes them not friendly to China by default.  50%(ish) of Tesla's sales come from China.  This just shows how unaware (or uncaring) Musk is about Tesla.  Tesla has more exposure to China than most companies because of their sales numbers and yet Elon just gets in bed with someone who got China to say they are ready for 'any kind of war' with America.  Don't think for a second the Chinese government won't be doing everything they can to bury Tesla with their EV companies now.",

It's admin censorship, not the typical user censorship: https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-launches-renewed-attacks-on-hamas-in-gaza-74776630\n\nAs an aside, one of the most annoying things about the death of free market capitalism in favor of industrial policy and regulatory capture is how much attention traders need to give to politicians. It's not just broad economic news out of the Fed anymore. Many individual stocks and entire industries revolve around government subsidies, taxes, regulations, protectionism, tariffs, etc. Heck, a boring midcap value company that typically bounces up and down 5% at most can instantly move 10-20% based off of a Trump post on Truth Social. \n\nThat's an advantage for human traders who know to look for this disorganized data compared to algos. But it's still annoying to have to pay attention to a bunch of grandstanding politicians all the time. There's always a ton of nonsense to sift through for every pertinent detail. Every time Elizabeth Warren hijacks a JPow testimony to talk about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or Greg Abbott shows up on CNBC to spin why Trump can deport immigrants against a direct court order (like this morning), I want to bang my head against the wall.",
