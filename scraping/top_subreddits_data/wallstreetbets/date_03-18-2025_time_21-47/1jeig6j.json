    "selftext": "**Jerome Powell's Speech:**\u00a0Don't be too concerned with Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow, because it will most likely be a copy of his speech from a week ago at the press conference. The market rallied over 1% on that speech as Jerome Powell tried to calm the markets. Mostly consisted of \"wait and see\" and \"the data is still fine\". The truth is we had a decent CPI and Jobs read for Feb, and PMI and consumer Sentiment were mediocre. The Fed simply cannot make a drastic stance on cuts or the economy this early without sufficient data.\n\n**Dot Plot:**\u00a0The most important thing to look for in the FOMC meeting tomorrow is the brand new revised dot plot. Every major investment bank along with CME Fed watch has their current predictions on rate cuts for 2025 at 2-3 cuts (leaning more towards 3). If we see the 19 members of the fed come out tomorrow and say they disagree with that, and we are more likely to stay with 2 cuts for 2025, we could see a sharp repricing down, as rate cuts are very bullish for the equities market. (you are going to want to see more dots shift down to the line right above 3.5)\n\n[Dec 2024 Dot Plot](https://preview.redd.it/5nidotlj2jpe1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=4262ada3bd7032b9e81342eebc1ab8f30fdd4151)\n\n**Summary of Economic Projections:**\u00a0Lastly is if the Fed will project a lower GDP then in there last prediction in December. They currently have it at 2.1% for 2025, which was raised from Sept 2024's prediction of 2.0%. But also note they increased their inflation metrics heavily in December.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjiz1afp2jpe1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c35aa479d40f066919285c8272ab43606015ff\n\nDec 2024 Projections\n\nThe last summary of projections was a sharp change to inflation reigniting due to their cuts, but also that GDP and Unemployment would improve slightly as a result. With new fiscal policies causing fears that we wont get those improvement in GDP or Unemployment, it really puts the Fed in a tough place where these new projections for March almost seem certain to be downgrades.\n\n[GDP 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/yc5hpmu42jpe1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d1932796db56357111549000d6f577c926191b)\n\nThe other thing to note is that the 2025 GDP projections have the widest distribution of all their 2025 projections. Meaning that the fed members are the most split or undecided on this decision, and that the new data could potentially really swing those numbers down. Opposed to unemployment where 14 of 19 Fed members all picked 4.3% for 2025, and are less likely to all be swayed or moved.\n\n[Unemployment 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/i3xbsfs82jpe1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0277eed836fe102e11c728f263d4ce3e0c1d205)\n\n**Summary:**\u00a0I personally believe we will get sharp adjustments down to GDP and slightly up to unemployment, while inflation will stay close to the same (maybe lowered a little). If this isn't met with the Dot Plot increasing the Fed's stance from 2 to 3 cuts for 2025 (I have no prediction for this as there are so many factors), expect more short term pain in the markets as investment banks downgrade and reprice assets down.",

            "body": "# **TLDR**\n\n---\n\n**Ticker:** SPY (and other broad market ETFs)\n\n**Direction:** Potentially Down\n\n**Prognosis:**  Prepare for volatility.  The market's reaction depends heavily on the Fed's revised dot plot (showing predicted interest rate cuts) and economic projections (GDP and unemployment).  A hawkish surprise (fewer rate cuts, higher GDP growth, lower unemployment than expected) could tank the market.  A dovish surprise (more cuts, lower GDP growth, higher unemployment) could boost it.\n\n**Powell's Speech:**  Probably boring and repetitive.  Don't sweat it.\n\n**Additional Info:** Author predicts downward revisions to GDP and slight upward revisions to unemployment.  A lot hinges on whether the dot plot shows more or fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.\n\n**Level of Agitation:** Mildly Anxious",
