    "selftext": "I started trading options in October, one trade a week. By January I was up 5k on 15k invested. I kept on telling my self I was gonna quit but I never did. I thought \u201cwow I\u2019m really good at this.\u201d\n\nThen I started losing in trades, buying more SPY calls etc and whenever I was wrong I doubled down which caused me to lose 3-4x more than my gains.\n\nI kept on adding more money but it never worked and by the end of Feb I was down 10k\u2026 \n\nI had my final 15k left and I made an \u201ceducated\u201d gamble on how SPY would react to some upcoming news and when the news dropped I was up from 15->20k within 2 minutes. I figured fuck it let me just hold until 25k but the market immediately corrected and I lost everything. \n\nSo here I am down ~30k from my peak and down 25k of my money that I worked two years to save up in college for.\n\nDon\u2019t know what to do right now and how to tell the family \u2026\n\nIf anyone knows a 10x bagger I can use to break even I\u2019d forever be indebted \ud83d\udc80\n",

If you let $100K sit with an annual rate of 8% APR and didn't contribute a single dollar during an allotted time of 2 years, you have $16k on top of that $100k. That's without any monthly contributions, you're just letting it sit.\n\n2) Dividends. $100k objectively has a lot more longterm investment potential, assuming you're not using gambling with 0tde options have a lot easier time accruing money than you would with 2 grand. For example, Vanguard. If you own 775 shares ($129/each) taxed at 15% annually (because of the amount I'm guessing their income tax bracket isn't valid for 0%), didn't contribute a single dollar (keep in mind, also highly unlikely you wouldn't contribute anything over the period of time you own these shares), you end up with $116k over 5 years. \n\n\nNow let's take a look at $2k's investment plan.\n\n\nCompound interest? After 2 years you get $2.3k. Same variables. Dividends? Laughable amount that's next to null.\n\nIt's arguably a lot worse to lose 20 grand and have 2 left, and I'd love for you to tell me how it isn't",

I am not trying to be a dick.\n\nI understand this is WSB and it is easy to get caught up in the excitement when you see people posting gains. But for every 100000% win you see, there are 100000 losses. \n\nYou lost money and so you come to the internet asking if anyone knows of a 10x bagger? Is this how you see life? Do you think it is that easy? I can assure you it is not. \n\nYou are a college sophomore so this tells me you are young. What you have working in your favor is time, and with time, the benefit of compounding. You need to learn about investing and allow time/compounding to grow your portfolio. In 20 years from now, when your portfolio has a value with at least 5 zeros at the end of it, you can start playing with options. Until then, if you keep trying to make money in options, you will always be broke.",

The saying first one is free is honestly so true, it's how it gets you. I made $2600 from a $600 PLTR call in Jan when markets were soaring. Proceded to lose the 2600 just by gambling it. The options subreddit is honestly really helpful. Greeks are super super important.\n\nI got a day job but I mainly scalp 0dte SPY and MSTR(sometimes in and out in 5 mins). Learn indicators, make your own If you can script/code. Use chatgpt(I have paid unsure if free is okay for trading) for reinforcing ideas, running simulations, strategies, and plan around your emotions, the market of today is not the market of tomorrow and the market of tomorrow is not the market of the day after. I find myself less emotional about it now and just go for it, have stops and cut loose if you see it going wrong, I'm pretty new to options/trading in general and I'm sure people here can give you better understanding but welcome to the Casino!\n\nAlso you're young, absorb the loss and move on, if you cant handle the swings take a break, maybe it's not for you, lots of ways to make money, but if you stick around welcome to the trenches lol.\n\nEdit: As for your family, I'm sure they'll understand if you show up with Wendy's!

NVDA is likely to hit $175 in the next 2 years.\n\nUse Robinhood Gold to collect 4-6% APY on your savings.\n\nNo more hail-marys or all-in YOLOs.",
