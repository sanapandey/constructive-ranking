A bunch of woke regards sipping lattes and playing smash brothers and guitar hero. Harry potter conference rooms, \"sleep rooms\" etc. Literally no one does anything. 5% of the people there do 95% of the work.\n\nI know a few women who are paid as much as the loser nerdy male engineers, and all these women do is check code for \"errors\" while their male counter parts, who make the same salary, do all the coding. These women then just travel all over the world and post pictures of themselves while calling themselves google engineers.\n\nThe company is a bloated whale floating in the ocean about to erupt in a spray of fermented rotting meat gas.",
