    "selftext": "Personally I think it\u2019s a lose lose scenario. Elons bullshit is Tesla its the reason the P/E is so high. He\u2019s been selling vaporware like FSD, and Robotaxi for a decade now and investors reward him with almost no measurable progress on those. Optimus isn\u2019t even close to. Hitting its goals. But even now, with sales declining still absurd p/e\n\nNobody can sell shit to investors like Elon. So what do we think the stock would do if he left.\nI\u2019m deep in poots since the $400 days so I want to make sure I don\u2019t get wrecked on an announcement that investors logically shouldn\u2019t like but do. Some major investors are calling for him to step down so it seems like they think it would benefit the stock. \n\nMy price target is $100 and below. With decking sales the PE has to crash down. \n\nPositions:     \n-300 shares $TSLA(short),    \n10 $220 August 2025 Puts. \n\n",

The Democrats that bought the cars because they wanted to help the environment are fleeing the company faster than Republicans are buying the cars to help DJT and Musk.  I just don\u2019t see how Tesla escapes the overhang of Democrats boycotting Tesla so long as Elon is the primary beneficiary of the company doing well as its largest stockholder.  \n\nAs long as Elon remains the top holder, and so long as he continues to drive Democrats away from him, Tesla can\u2019t grow. It can only shrink. And that means the stock is insanely overvalued at current levels, even after the fifty percent haircut it\u2019s taken so far.",

That would be selling about 15 million cars year (current top global car seller is Toyota at 10 million a year). Their mass market cars are about $40K price average when you look globally (china being a big market), so that would be $600 billion annual revenue. Profit margin has been sitting at 9%, which makes this is about $54 billion profit. Price the company at a normal automotive 8x P/E, and the company should have a market cap of $450 billion.\n\nCurrent market cap is $700 billion. So even if you think tesla is going to grow to this huge number, basically twice as big as the current biggest car seller... The stock would still be overvalued by about 30-40% at current price. Target price would be about $150/share. \n\nAssuming it gets to more like equal to Toyota in total sales, target price per share would be $100/share.\n\nAnd these are both **optimistic predictions** on it's future growth.\n\nIf it runs into actual headwinds of being outcompeted (or even just matched) on technology, or serious boycotting efforts, it should end up worth substantially less. Matching Honda's global production, for instance, it would be target price $40/share for fair value.",

Yeah, their cars look weird as hell with all the sensors stacked on top.  But they\u2019re picking up fares for people in Vegas, pulling up to the curb and not hitting people, getting them there safe, yada yada. \n\nI think that the Tesla fleet will approach a level of autonomy that\u2019s close to self driving, but that it wont be able to get fully there with the amount of sensor tech that\u2019s installed in them.  The autopilot just fails so often, even with regular updates.  By fail, I don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s crashing my car; rather that the system disengages far too often and reverts control back to me.  The system can never disengage if there isn\u2019t a human behind the wheel; it goes from optional to essential.\n\nStill, I think you\u2019ve spotted the true diamond in the dirt.  Google.",

Honestly, if they were not required to have the thing that made having a weight attached to the steering wheel not work as \"I promise Im paying attention\" I'd be using it for all driving already, it's quite good now. Couple years ago, was not as stellar. Still has its moments, where it drives like a teenager or a grandma, but they are less frequent.\n\nId be totally cool just using FSD for driving me everywhere currently.\n\nApparently you can trick it into driving through a wiley coyote fake train tunnel, I have yet to encounter on of those in my driving experience.",
