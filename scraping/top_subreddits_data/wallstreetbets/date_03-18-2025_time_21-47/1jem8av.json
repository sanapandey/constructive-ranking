Not to mention the fact that the product is trash - does anyone still use this thing? What other monetization levers can they pull? They already have Snapchat premium and ad-supported thirst traps discover pages.",

It attracts a semi-unique audience and monetizes fairly effectively. Its AR products outperform those of other social platforms, and unlike doomscroll-heavy apps, Snap focuses more on connection. In metropolitan areas with public transport, you'll see people of all ages using it. While its stereotypes hold some truth, just because you\u2019re not using it doesn\u2019t mean it lacks value.

Groupchats in Snapchat are absolutely next level and the generation below me use it a disgusting amount. I coached a hockey team a few years back of 14-17 year olds and basically all of them had 100+ unopened snaps at any given point. \n\nNow as I\u2019m getting a bit older and certainly using it less, mostly for groupchats at this point but the current generation that\u2019s in highschool and just starting college and university use it a ridiculous amount. I don\u2019t see it going anywhere anytime soon\n\nEdit: not saying this is a good buy by any means, but so many people still use it. I also know for social media platforms it pays the most by far to influencers. If you ever see famous TikTok star spamming stories it\u2019s because Snap pays like 200k a month to all these influencers",
