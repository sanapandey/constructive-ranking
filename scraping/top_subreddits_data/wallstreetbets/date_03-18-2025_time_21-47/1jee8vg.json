They have always been terrible quality cars. Arguably their greatest achievement was being able to convince people that their completely unobtainable vision for the future of their cars was ever even a remote possibility. \n\nFSD was never going to work, it was always a pipe dream from the day Elon saw I Robot in theaters. The only way it could ever work would be a major nationwide push where we basically banned all vehicles without it and forced everyone to buy new cars. Neural networks and sensors are great and can be a great addition to a human drivers natural distractions. But they're never going to be able to see or make the same subtle distinctions as a human can, Mark Rober's video was a prime example of this fact. \n\nEven outside the stuff Rober showed off, there's other stuff like when an exit is closed or a huge pot hole or debris in the road exists that the cars sensors just aren't going to realize most of the time, even with LIDAR.",

You are not going to make money on contracts like these which are soooo OTM that even after such huge movement, the small bump in these contacts is burned away on normal days. You can find way more probable contracts within your cost than the lottery method you are using.\n\nFor eg, 205 put for next month is around your cost right now which is likely to hit post April tariffs. This contract has doubled in the last 2 days whereas I am confident that your 5 dollar puts hardly moved in price. This is due to the delta being so small for those options.",

For whatever reason I had an issue with online casinos like Roulette & Baccarrat but never had a problem with Opitions/Stocks.\n\nAlso I've almost paid off the debt by just tightening down and grinding.

Each call backs 100 shares, so the easiest way to start would be buy 100 shares of something like IonQ (or some stock you like long term) and sell 1 covered call backed by the 100 shares that you own. The depreciation of options accelerates exponentially as the expiration date approaches. So you can start by selling covered calls on Wednesday that expire on Friday (just as an example). The higher the volatility of the stock, the more you will get for the calls that you sell. Some strategies I\u2019ve used in the past to varying levels of success is buying shares of a company pre-earnings and then selling some out of the money covered calls (strike price is above the current share price), with a strike price that even if the contracts that I sell end up in the money, the strike price is higher than what I paid for the shares. In this case, you have the following possible outcomes \n\nA) stock price goes up -> you make money (less than you may have made if you hadn\u2019t have sold covered calls, as selling covered calls caps your maximum profit)\n\nB) stock price stays relatively flat -> the options you sell expire worthless, meaning you make money\n\nC) the stock price falls -> you lose money if the decreased value of the 100 shares is greater than the premium you gained from selling the covered call\n\n\nJust an idea to consider.",

The acceleration, although fast, feels soulless and forced and quite frankly nauseating, and not in the good way. The whole thing just feels robotic and boring and the interior/screen system makes you feel like you\u2019re driving a fuckin iPhone. It almost feels like when driving a Tesla, you get forcefully sucked back into the feeling of all the worldly bullshit that you normally try to mentally escape when driving a real normal car. Like you know when you get off a long shift and can breathe a sigh of relief when you walk out the office and finally sit in your car? Being in a Tesla feels like an even worse extension of still being in the office. Anyway besides that the build quality fucking sucks, the autopilot/whatever tf it\u2019s called is pointless as fuck, and everything else about the car literally makes your life 10x more inconvenient. I mean to buy one of these, you either have to be too broke to afford a gas performance car or just have really put zero thought into your decision. What a SHIT vehicle",

While recent reports indicate that the mooing sector remains robust, certain external pressures\u2014such as the highly volatile oink market\u2014have raised concerns about overall farm productivity. Nevertheless, Old MacDonald has reassured stakeholders that his time-tested strategy of shouting \u201cE-I-E-I-O\u201d at random intervals will continue to serve as the primary tool for maintaining stability, despite clear evidence that neither the chickens nor the cows appear to understand monetary policy.\n\nLooking ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue its rigorous, data-driven analysis of the farm\u2019s performance, closely watching key indicators such as hay consumption, egg-laying velocity, and overall bovine sentiment. While we acknowledge that unforeseen disruptions\u2014such as a particularly stubborn goat or an overzealous rooster\u2014could introduce short-term volatility, our baseline projection remains unchanged: Old MacDonald will, against all odds, persist in his approach of doing things exactly the way he always has. The Federal Reserve stands ready to provide guidance should conditions warrant, though we fully expect that no amount of economic modeling will ever prevent the sheep from wandering off course.",
