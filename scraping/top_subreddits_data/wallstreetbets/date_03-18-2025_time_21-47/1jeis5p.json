    "selftext": "MicroStrategy has accumulated nearly 500,000 BTC, but they are now slowing down their purchases. If they start liquidating strategically, they could crash Bitcoin without anyone noticing until it's too late.\n\nImagine the perfect play:\n\nThey sell slowly OTC to avoid scaring the market.\n\nMeanwhile, they short BTC with leverage to maximize profits.\n\nOnce support breaks, they dump everything, triggering liquidations.\n\nBitcoin crashes below 30k, ETFs see massive outflows, and they cash in billions.\n\n\nIf BTC no longer grows exponentially, MicroStrategy is trapped. They either exit now with a profit or risk imploding with the asset. And if they decide to sell, we could witness the biggest Big Short in crypto history.\n\nToo paranoid or a plausible scenario?\n",

If you own a stock and it goes down, you need to get out or continue to DCA into the stock....or do nothing.\n\nYou should only do covered calls when you own a stock that has gone up a large amount. Then from a position of power, you sell a covered call with the assumption that the stock will pull back. Even then I'd never sell more than .10 delta call and be very quick to exit if the stock starts going up again. \n\nCovered calls don't give much protection when, by default, you have to own 100 shares of the underlying. So you will never be net positive from a downside move. Luckily you can just do spreads to balance delta exposure if you need protection.",

Let\u2019s break it down:\n\t1.\tMichael Saylor & MicroStrategy (MSTR) in 2001\n\t\u2022\tIn March 2000, MicroStrategy (MSTR) restated its financials due to aggressive accounting practices that overstated revenues.\n\t\u2022\tThis caused MSTR\u2019s stock to collapse from about $300 to $30 in a day, erasing billions in market cap.\n\t\u2022\tThe SEC charged Saylor and other executives with civil fraud, and they settled without admitting wrongdoing.\n\t2.\tDid this \u201cinitiate\u201d the dot-com bubble burst?\n\t\u2022\tNo, the dot-com bubble was already at a breaking point due to widespread overvaluation, excessive speculation, and unprofitable business models.\n\t\u2022\tThe NASDAQ had already peaked on March 10, 2000, before MicroStrategy\u2019s crash.\n\t\u2022\tWhile MSTR\u2019s collapse shook confidence in tech stocks, it wasn\u2019t the primary cause of the crash\u2014it was just one of many overhyped companies that unraveled.\n\t3.\tIs he \u201cdoing this again\u201d with Bitcoin?\n\t\u2022\tSaylor has heavily leveraged MicroStrategy to buy Bitcoin, making it a de facto Bitcoin ETF.\n\t\u2022\tIf Bitcoin collapses, MSTR could face massive losses, potentially triggering a stock crash.\n\t\u2022\tHowever, unlike in 2000, there\u2019s no fraud accusation\u2014just high risk, high leverage, and extreme bullishness on BTC.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe statement is partly true but misleading. Saylor\u2019s 2000 fiasco hurt markets but wasn\u2019t the cause of the dot-com crash. His Bitcoin strategy today is risky, but it\u2019s not equivalent to accounting fraud.",

There have been 51 military take overs in modern history, of that 6 are left. So 6/51 chance that a military that holds power will stay in power in the proceeding years.

Yes, Elon got a slap on the wrist for $420 funding confirmed, but this is completely different. You can\u2019t petition Congress to adopt a bitcoin treasury, file your intentions not to sell your company\u2019s crypto reserve in your sec filings, write books about not selling your bitcoin, rename your company \u201cstrategy\u201d with a Bitcoin logo, and then pull a mega pump and dump rug pull on your shareholders. This isn\u2019t like Elon and his DOGE PA. That\u2019s wire fraud, securities fraud, and a litany of felonies.\n\nThere is a scenario where they sell, but that would require extenuating circumstances where they had to in order to avoid insolvency. Again, this isn\u2019t like a company adding an immaterial amount of bitcoin to their balance sheet and noting they\u2019re marketable securities (or whatever you\u2019d call crypto) that may be sold, or a pumper with their PA. This is a company that made their logo the Bitcoin symbol.\n\nI will also caveat that I don\u2019t expect Bitcoin to hold up indefinitely - it will likely fall, just like it does in every other cycle, and Saylor very well might get burned. This scenario detailed by OP isn\u2019t going to happen though lmao. If it does, Saylor will be going to jail longer than Bernie Madoff.",
