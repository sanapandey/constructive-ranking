One major finding is that power structures without accountability lead to abuse, which makes clergy in typical religious settings more likely to commit offenses. We absolutely need to consider how to change these structures to protect vulnerable people.",

In addition, if your child is a member of anything like this, you should be up to date on child abuse prevention so you know what red flags to look for. Too many of those programs allow people with unhealthy relationships with children to interact with kids.",

It is now a rule that two registered and trained adults minimum are required at all scout events, including all meetings and trips, and one-on-one contact is not allowed at any time.  Everyone who registers as an adult volunteer has to go through an extensive online training course yearly.  \n\nhttps://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/gss01/\n\nThe Boy Scouts were negligent on this front for decades, because nobody wanted to admit it was happening, leading to a ton of abuse, but when it came out, the lawsuits and settlements that eventually came from that drove them nearly into bankruptcy.    \n\nThe modern organization is very different.  In my experience it's a solid model for how to responsibly handle volunteer interactions between adults and children at an organizational level.  When I was a volunteer, I used to bristle a bit every year at the time commitment required to do the online training, but it is thorough and thoughtful and goes a long way toward ensuring that every volunteer is informed about how potential predators act and how to prevent situations they can take advantage of from ever arising.",

According to this site, it was covered up because he had no record (yeah, no shit, you get the record when you get penalized, if you ignore it then there's no record) and because he wasn't molesting BOYS! The church doesn't care about the women and girls, just don't touch the boys. And to be fair, they hardly cared about that until their spot was completely blown up.

The fact that the Catholic Church continues to entrust over 500k members of the church to his care and guidance should be enough to damn the entire Church.  \n\n\n>In 1998, Aymond allowed Brian Matherne, a coach at Sacred Heart of Jesus School in Norco, to remain in his post for several months after receiving information from an alleged abuse victim\u2019s father that Matherne had molested his son 13 years earlier. He dropped the matter without alerting police after unsuccessful attempts to speak to the alleged victim, then 24 years old, who later told the St. Charles Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office about the matter. Matherne was arrested and pled guilty to molesting 17 children over 15 years. He is serving a 30-year sentence in the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Aymond defended the church, but later stated he should have fired Matherne.",

Then it makes very little sense that all of the political energy and legislation is behind persecuting a small group of people, who has very little unsupervised access to children, in the name of saving the children.\n\nWhile on the other hand, there are a large number of clergy who do have unsupervised access to children.  children who are taught by their parents to trust their religious leaders without question.  And yet, not only is there no push for any legislation to limit access to children, or inflict severe punishment for those that offend, but actually the opposite.  Local governments have been involved in several cases of helping to cover up for churches.  And many state legislations are pushing for voucher programs and off campus religious programs that give religious groups MORE access to children on the taxpayers' dime.\n\nNot sure what point you were trying to make, but you still made the point that our elected reps are going after the wrong people.",
