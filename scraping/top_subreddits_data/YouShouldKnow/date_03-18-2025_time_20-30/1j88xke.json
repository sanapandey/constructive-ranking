    "selftext": "Why YSK: This is one of the most commonly misspoken idioms in English. Using the correct wording not only is grammatically correct, but it makes you sound more credible and educated. This is to your benefit when arguing a point, writing an essay, or applying for a job.\n\nThe origin of this idiom dates back to historical periods of conquest and first contact with new regions; it was a noteworthy event when they would \"first set foot\" upon newly claimed land.\n\nhttps://crossidiomas.com/set-foot/",
