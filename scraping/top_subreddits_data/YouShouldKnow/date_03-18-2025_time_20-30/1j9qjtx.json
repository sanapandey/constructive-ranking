    "selftext": "Why YSK:\n\nA lot of people are currently unable to use their Google Chromecast Audio and Gen 2 Chromecast devices due to a bug on Google's end, likely an expired security certificate. This is a workaround that is useful in some cases.\n\nIf you have VLC installed (either on a computer or on your Android phone), the casting option still works. This is likely because VLC has its own implementation of Chromecast that sends audio directly to the device rather than streaming from the cloud. \n\nThe downside is that the media must be accessible locally - either on your device or on a network share. If that is possible for you then you can still enjoy Chromecast media.\n\nIn the VLC app on Android this is as simple as using the Cast button. On a PC go to the Playback menu and select the Renderer option. It should list your Chromecast devices and device groups. Groups may not work but rendering to single devices definitely does (for now).\n\nI hope this is useful to some people. I have six Chromecast Audio devices around my house connected to various amplifiers and powered speakers. It's usually absolutely awesome to be able to sync music around my various rooms and this bug is causing me severe grief. \n\nI'm not sure why they stopped making them although I'm guessing it's something to do with the litigation with Sonos. I really hope they put out a new version before my ones start breaking down.",
