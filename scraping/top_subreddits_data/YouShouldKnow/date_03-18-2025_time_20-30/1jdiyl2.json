    "selftext": "Why YSK: If you suspect someone is following you on foot or in a vehicle, making four consecutive right turns will either:\n- Confirm they\u2019re following you (since normal drivers or pedestrians wouldn\u2019t loop in a square).\n-Lead you back to your starting point, where you can seek help or go somewhere safe.\n\nIf you\u2019re sure you\u2019re being followed:\n-Avoid going straight home. Instead, head to a police station, a busy public place, or a well-lit area.\n-Call for help. If in a car, don\u2019t stop or exit until you\u2019re in a secure location.",

Mine involved going to a university library, which had multiple entrances/exits where one had to have a card to get past the barriers. Thankfully, I only had to use this strategy once.",

I should've specified that in my post. In my day to day driving I don't have people follow me lol. \n\nI think part of it is because I drive a nicer car. People tend to have a negative bias towards cars like that. I understand it and I do the same whenever I see a BMW pass me. \n\nAt the same time, I've noticed people move over a lot more when I'm driving my car, even if I'm not driving fast. Like 8/10 people will move over. It's kinda nice actually. I feel like a cop lol. \n\nSorry if I explained. I'm ADHD af and had a lot of caffeine today.\n\nTLDR: I try not to be an asshole driver\n\nEdit: not sure why people think I'm lying. I don't really lie about things.

The road is about a mile and a half with a couple more stop lights, but they were all green. Stop light where I turn left the car in front was also turning left, and continued on for another mile or so, through more lights. Then, down a kind of residential road that I take to avoid some of the obnoxious roads, they turn right... as do I. At this point I think they thought I was following them because they started going probably 40 in a 25. Except there are also stop signs, so they'd stop, wait for the car to cross, I'd get up behind them again, and they'd book it - at least until we reached the stop sign where I turned right after they went straight (3 or 4 stop signs down)",

She looks over her shoulder again, busts into a run for the last 20-30 feet and runs into into some building, and makes sure the door closes behind her. I'm super nervous. I realize I have no indicator now, suck it up and glance over my shoulder and see.... no one. The ATM was two doors down from the door she ran in. I realize she's running from me. My then GF observed the whole thing and was dying of laughter. \n\nAnother story:  my grandmother was in comfort care in the hospital. It was like 2:00 a.m., and my dad asked me to run to his truck for a pack of smokes. I get super anxious in the garage and start running back. He asks me what's up and if everything's okay. Told him I felt sketched out but didn't see anyone, and he proceeds to laugh and tell me, \"Bud, you look like the guy people are running out of parking garages to get away from.\"",

I worked in manhattan and lived in queens so my commute was an hour and thirty with 2 trains & 1 bus.\n\nThe first train ride, I noticed a dude looking at me a lot but I didn\u2019t think anything of it, it\u2019s free to look.& happy to be look-able so I just continued to mind my own business.\n\nThe next train, he sat across me again all the way to the last stop, just glancing. I assumed he noticed we were on the last train so again, I gave it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI got on the bus, a bus stop that has like 20 other buses and again, seated right across from me. What were the chances? I mean, I\u2019m taking this commute too, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility\n\nBut something told me to get off at a few stops earlier than my own as my stop was literally right in front of my house\n\nI got off and so did he, it\u2019s close to 1am now on this dark sidewalk alone with this man and I didn\u2019t want to be rude and start running so I start marching but then he kept calling out to me and I felt if I didn\u2019t stop, he\u2019d start running and attack me.\n\nI stopped reaallll close to a house with lights in case I had to scream and calmly asked what I could help him with \n\n**Blah blah I wanna get to know you mumble**\n\nI apologized because I was very busy and tired from work and would like to go home. He kept walking with me for a bit to try to convince me but at that point I was really done  and I said \u201cmmkay have a good night and just basically walked off, doing the 4 right turn & he noticed and headed for the bust stop for the opposite direction which I confirmed that he at least followed me some of the way. \n\nLike shoot your shot buddy but maybe not in the dead of night after that long commute and I didn\u2019t look at you back.",

They asked me like ten times if I had a drink and then basically (verbally) forced me to take a breathalizer test - which I accepted because I basically never drink.. passed that seemingly with 0.0 and suddenly they let me go as if nothings wrong?)",

When I made another turn to get back on track, I noticed then that they were, again, still behind us.\n\nWe weren't in a hurry, so I decided better safe than sorry- so I just kept turning in a big loop.

If the car follows, they're trapped until the car in front leaves the gate. They can call the police from there. What happens next is a tossup.\n\nPull into a bank drive through, go through a lane and stop just past the teller window. The car behind can't open the driver door because the bank window is there.
