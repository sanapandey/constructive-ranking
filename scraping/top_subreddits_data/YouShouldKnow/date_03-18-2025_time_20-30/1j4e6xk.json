    "selftext": "**Why YSK:** Using tap water in ultrasonic or cool-mist humidifiers can create a significant amount of airborne particulate matter, drastically reducing indoor air quality. Tap water contains dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium, which ultrasonic humidifiers aerosolize into fine particles (PM2.5, PM1.0, and PM10). This can raise indoor particulate matter levels to concentrations comparable to outdoor air pollution or cooking smoke.\n\nI knew that my humidifier manual recommended distilled water, but I figured it was to prolong the life of the unit and lead to less mineral build-up. But I didn't think it could be harmful to health. I used an air quality tester device to measure particulate matter and was shocked to see how much higher the numbers were with my filtered well water compared to distilled water.\n\nThese tiny particles, often visible as \"white dust\" around your humidifier, can penetrate deep into your lungs, potentially causing respiratory irritation, coughing, or exacerbating conditions like asthma, especially for infants, kids, and people with respiratory issues.\n\n**Why you should consider switching to distilled water or an evaporative humidifier:**\n\n* Using distilled water drastically reduces particulate emissions and improves indoor air quality.\n* Evaporative humidifiers are safer alternatives since they don't aerosolize mineral particles.\n* Regular cleaning of your humidifier prevents bacterial and mineral buildup.\n\nThe good news is that switching to distilled water quickly reduces particulate pollution, significantly improving your indoor air quality.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33108019/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33108019/)\n\n[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7408721/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7408721/)\n\nImages of my air quality sensor readings: [https://imgur.com/a/xtHVTyM](https://imgur.com/a/xtHVTyM) \\- Note: Low numbers are when I used distilled water, very high numbers are when I used city tap water - both of those were taken next to the humidifier running on highest setting. And medium numbers were from a different humidifier running on low setting on well water.",

As other mentioned humidifiers can go through a gallon a night and with a kid constantly bringing home school sicknesses they get a lot of use too. \nI also use it for home brewing on occasion when I either need to cut (soften) my tap water or I want to build up a water profile from scratch. \n\nThe thing has been working beautifully for 4ish years so I\u2019d say we\u2019re past breaking even at this point but as someone else mentioned, the electric cost is definitely a factor I don\u2019t usually consider. \n\nJust curious, where are you getting 5 gallon containers of distilled water?

Chlorine in the water will eat the membrane so make sure to get (and change) the carbon filters. \n\nThe only downside is the rejection ratio. For those reading, reverse osmosis filters usually reject half of the water while filtering, depending on a number of factors. Luckily, drinking water isn't scarce where I am and I use maybe 1.5 gallons per day. Also, if you have hard water you'll need to treat it first (soft here, around 25ppm from the tap) otherwise you'll clog things up.",

It takes a good 5 hours to fill the jug, which in turn fills my humidifier about 80% full. That'll last about 1.5-2 days of running my humidifier. This is in a very arid climate where outdoor RH is something like 19-22% and I'm elevating my inside RH to about 45%. It sounds like a lot of work but it takes 45 seconds to setup the distiller and press start, usually do this as I'm leaving for work and then fill the humidifier when I get home as needed.",

OP isn't clear whether he wants to talk in 1st person or switch to a Wikipedia style. So you see that AI-summarizer type feel in the 3rd paragraph. Then then of course the summary bullet points with the bold heading. It's not the fact that it's formatted that way that's weird, it's that it's even in there in the first place because it's just a straight repeat of the prior paragraphs which take like 30 seconds to read.

Cooling towers have a bit of a \u2018splash zone\u2019 where little droplets of cooling water can splash or be blown out of the bottom of the tower by wind. When these droplets splash out, they carry with them their load of dissolved solutes. Large drops land on the ground adjacent to the cooling tower and leave behind a salty residue when they finally evaporate. Small drops can remain aloft like an aerosol until they evaporate. This deposits tiny crystals of those salts in the air which can further disperse as an aerosol. \n\nBecause of that particulate air emission, these systems are typically regulated (in my national jurisdiction) per some allowable percentage of the total cooling water flow that can be lost to drift. I think that allowable percentage is calculated by modeling for the pounds of salts per acre each month in peak conditions.",

The evaporation happens in the air, so limescale dust hangs around in the air until either you inhale it or it settles on your collection of novelty doorknobs.\n\nThe major downside of evaporative cooling is that you have, for all practical purposes, a sponge that is constantly damp and in a breeze.

And also as you said, calcium, minerals, etc. as well. I believe a lot of ultrasonic humidifiers recommended using distilled water for this reason. Though the percentage of people actually going to the store to buy distilled water for this is probably close to zero.\n\nBut with evaporative humidifiers, anything that isn't H2O is left behind in the humidifier on the filter. Yes, you still need to clean those, but you don't need to be as diligent. Bacterial growth can still be nasty, so cleaning it regularly is still a good habit. And if you don't swap the filter often enough, the calcium left behind on the filter makes it not able to absorb as much water, reducing the effectiveness of your humidifier. Of course, evaporative humidifiers aren't as good at humidifying the air in general. So there's that trade off.\n\nAnd there's steam humidifiers, but I have done the least amount of research on those out of those three most common ones.",

As long as you regularly maintain your humidifier and change the filter as needed, the amount of sediment released into the air is vastly lower. Also, your HVAC equipment runs more efficiently when the humidity in your home is at a proper level. This saves you money on energy costs and potential future repairs.",
