I thought some were free, sorry man, I signed up for patreon once I learned of it so I\u2019m not sure what non patreon members see\u2026 I only know the YouTube stuff is obviously free. Still plenty of free stuff out there if you don\u2019t mind ads and being a product instead of a willing consumer that directly and fairly compensates creators of the content we consume. I\u2019m a huge fan of the pay directly model. I get the difference between $5/month being just too much to ask and $5/month not being a bother, I\u2019ve lived on both sides of that spectrum so I can reluctantly understand. I hope you can enjoy the podcast though!",
