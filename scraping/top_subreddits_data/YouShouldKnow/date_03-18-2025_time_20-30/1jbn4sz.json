    "selftext": "**Why YSK: Ordering directly from restaurants saves you money and helps the restaurant.**\n\nIn addition to charging delivery fees and service fees, the apps very often increase the cost of individual items by as much as 35%, none of which goes to the restaurant. \n\nDoorDash charged $25 for an entree that was $18 by ordering take-out directly from the restaurant.\n\nEdit: Obviously it\u2019s going to be more expensive to order from a third party. The distinction I\u2019m making is that the extra expense does not just come from fees (which membership programs like Dashpass usually \u201cwaive\u201d) ",
