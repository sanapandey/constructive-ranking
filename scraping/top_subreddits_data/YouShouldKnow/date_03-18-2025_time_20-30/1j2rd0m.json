From what I\u2019ve seen the black card advertises you can visit multiple locations but it doesn\u2019t affect their cancellation policy. I think no matter what membership I had I would be looking up the cancellation policy in advance of a move just because I\u2019m paranoid about the stereotype of it being so difficult. I realize not all people are like this but that\u2019s how they get you and it\u2019s not just PF. Always gotta read the fine print.",

You need to call your home gym and have them make the transfer.\n\nSadly, the location I signed up at doesn\u2019t do transfer requests over the phone, you have to go in to do that.\n\nLol",

Surely they have some alternative method if the home gym is shut down. But they would not let us.  It was 3 memberships, me and my adult children. We were in an emergency situation and facing homelessness so it was a bit frustrating. We're okay now, thankfully. Found a home but I think we'll stick with the YMCA for now (as far as gym goes).",

OP is trying to help people and you are after their for their financial mgmt?\n\nSecond, maybe since you seem very entitled (judging solely on this comment) you have never lived on a budget or paycheck to paycheck before. Great for you but other people do. When you are, and you expect a $1 charge and instead get hit with a $50 charge, and then overdraft fees from the bank, it's a pretty big problem. That could mean missing rent payments, not eating, or having to pay a utility bill late which means more fees you can't afford.\n\nIt's also possible OP is practicing good security and separates their cash on hand to a different account for automated transaction so they can protect their primary account and funds.\n\nIn conclusion, maybe think before you post?",
