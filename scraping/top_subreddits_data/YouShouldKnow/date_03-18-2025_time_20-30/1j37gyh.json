    "selftext": "Why YSK: So i've been seeing a lot of posts of people saying ublock origin has been removed from their google chrome browser and that is not at all what is happening. Chrome asks if you want to remove it but you can just say no.  When chrome gives this message that it wants to remove it you can just click no. Then it wont be removed but still disabled. If you then go to your extensions page you can just activate it again. It will tell you that it is not recommended but you can just say run anyways. ",
