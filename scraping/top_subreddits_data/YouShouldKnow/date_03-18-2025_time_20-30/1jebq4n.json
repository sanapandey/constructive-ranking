Select \"It shows my personal info and I don't want it there.\"\n\n4. Select \"Contact info.\"\n\n5. Enter your name and the contact info that appears.\n\nIf approved, your info will no longer appear in Google searches within a few hours.\n\nWhy YSK, stalkers, spammers, or basically anyone could easily pull up your contact details if they have your name from a Google search. Doing this is will make it harder to find your info.",

            "body": "So this is a bit misleading. You can *request* that google removes the identifying information from their search results, but ultimately it\u2019s not a guarantee.  \n\nEven if it gets removed, it may very well show up again if you\u2019ve not bothered to or can\u2019t get it removed from the site that\u2019s storing and displaying the information.  \n\nThe best fix for this is to not share your information anywhere you\u2019re not 100% confident of in the first place. The next best fix is security awareness in the event you do start getting spammed (don\u2019t click on suspicious links, check out your family tree and make sure you aren\u2019t related to any Nigerian princes, etc) and due diligence whenever you\u2019re signing up for websites or sharing your data.",
