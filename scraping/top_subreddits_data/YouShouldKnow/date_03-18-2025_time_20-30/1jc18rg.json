    "selftext": "Why YSK: When dealing with rude, stubborn, or bossy individuals, reacting emotionally gives them control over the situation. Instead, pausing, speaking in a calm and measured tone, and refusing to be drawn into their negativity forces them to adjust. This technique is used in healthcare, law enforcement, and negotiations to de-escalate conflicts and maintain control. If someone keeps interrupting, stopping mid-sentence and restarting calmly can frustrate them into listening. If nothing works, walking away denies them the reaction they seek.",

So I asked what she would suggest and pretended to listen. Next day I changed nothing and she goes \u201cmuch better\u201d and I told her it was the exact same recipe. Now she doesn\u2019t talk to me and I couldn\u2019t be happier. When I didn\u2019t get upset at her calling them awful she got really weird almost as though all she wanted was to be mean to someone.

                    "body": "As someone with a similar upbringing, the hardest part when it comes to dealing with someone who's angry, and also has something like Bipolar disorder is really figuring out what they are actually angry about, and whether this is something you can actually try to stop in the future, or if you have no control over things at all. \n\nIf it's something you genuinely did, like you left a mess and they got annoyed at coming home to a mess, there's all sorts of ways to deal with it in a healthy manner, like making sure to clean up after yourself better so there are less potential tripwires to set them off in the future. But unfortunately, a lot of the times they'll be angry about entirely unrelated things, be in a bad mood, and the tiniest little thing you did will set them off at you. They'll know \"I'm angry\" but because of the emotional storm in their head, they can only think about what you did that set them off, so they won't really recognize that most of their anger is unrelated. As a result, no matter what you do or say it will just add fuel to the fire because they'll take any chance to confirm that you are the cause of their full anger.\n\nPlacate them, and you'll just support whatever fantasy is brewing up in their head about \"what *actually* happened\". But if you try to refute them, you're now back-sassing and being hostile towards them, \"proving\" their assumptions true about how you're responsible for whatever is angering them. And yet if you have no reaction at all, now *you're* the one being unreasonable and refusing to listen or communicate, so that's just making them even more annoyed at the situation.\n\nIt's really a damned if you do, damned if you don't. There's no good option, since even walking away is \"refusing to be civil and talk about this\" in their head. As adults, you can just walk away and drop them from your life. But as kids, you are just stuck with your parents and there isn't much you can do about it beyond pray that they suddenly realize and change, which isn't exactly a realistic thing to hope for...",

The issue was that it was impossible to talk with her: she had paranoid tendencies and an snappish rage-easy personality and thus she would take almost everything you could say to her in the worst way. So it was natural that after years of trying stuff we would just default to staring at her without saying anything because when every single thing you can say will be used against you you eventually learn the hard way to just not say anything. We did the \"gray rock\" thing without even knowing about it.\n\nThe interesting thing is that maybe as a defense mechanism against the silence she started just talking all the time and letting anyone else let a single word in. \"Conversations\" with her would always be her talking 100% of the time. I guess it was an unconscious way for her to feel she still was in control. She wouldn't let us avert our eyes though. We had to pretend like we were listening otherwise she would get furious again.",

If someone is becoming irrational and spiraling into an emotional rant, suddenly and EXTREMELY aggressively forcing the conversation to a stop can be *such* a tonal whiplash that it makes the other person just pause, and in that time they can calm down.\n\nSomething like, if the angry person is raising their voice but not really shouting, and it's clear they just won't stop no matter what, aggressively slamming the table and screaming \"SHUT UP FOR A MOMENT\", especially if you've been very civil prior, can come out of nowhere so rapidly that they don't know how to react.\n\nEmotional spirals are just that, spirals, and so doing something that interrupts their momentum can stop them from getting any worse, and let you regain control of the conversation.\n\nOf course there's a very fine line between \"sudden and careful use of loudness and false aggression\" and \"being carelessly hostile\", so if you do it in the wrong situation or do it poorly, it can just set the other person off even more. You aren't \"being aggressive\", you are \"using aggression as a device\" to specifically cause tonal whiplash to make the other person metaphorically stumble and stop in place. But when the situation is right, that brief moment where their mind has to take a moment to figure out \"wtf just happened?\" can be enough to bring them out of an emotional spiral.",

He was just asking for conflict or a fight or I don't know what was his problem because I was clearly considerate enough. I watched him and said nothing, totally ignoring him.
