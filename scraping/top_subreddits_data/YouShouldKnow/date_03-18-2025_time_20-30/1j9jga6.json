    "selftext": "I work in an Emergency Department. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to come in for one thing but add \u201cchest pain\u201d or \u201cfeeling short of breath\u201d because they think it\u2019ll get them a room quicker.\n\n**Why YSK:** there are several reasons why it\u2019s not a great idea:\n- *It doesn\u2019t get you a room quicker.* Chest pain is not an emergency. The types of scary things that could potentially *cause* chest pain\u2014such as a heart attack \u2014 are an emergency. The staff will get an EKG and if it\u2019s normal you\u2019ll probably go right back to the waiting room. \n- *It will probably lengthen your overall stay.* If you report chest pain we are legally obligated to get extra labs and a chest x-ray, and they won\u2019t discharge you till all the results come back. And if you have a serious medical history, they might admit you to the hospital even if all your tests come back normal. Also, most ED\u2019s have 2 sections, a main ED for serious stuff and a fast track for non-serious stuff. If you\u2019ve led the staff to think you may be having a heart attack they probably won\u2019t put you in the fast track where you could be treated and discharged earlier.\n- *Extra expense.* All those extra tests cost money. Your bill might be pretty expensive if they have to order extra tests.\n- *Your original medical complaint may not get addressed.* If you come in for knee pain but add \u201cchest pain\u201d to your complaint, I really only care about the chest pain. The purpose of the ED is to identify and treat medical emergencies, not address 100% of your medical complaints. And the staff are *especially* unlikely to care about your knee pain if they think you shaded the truth about your chest pain to get a room faster.\n- *Multiple complaints confuse everything.* If you say you have leg pain AND chest pain I start thinking of what could cause both of those things simultaneously. Some crazy electrolyte disorder? Blood clots? (Better not bring them back to the fast track because we don\u2019t have the staff to deal with complicated stuff)\n\nSo it pays to be truthful. If you really do have chest pain you should DEFINITELY tell us. But don\u2019t shade the truth to get a room faster\n\n**[EDIT: to be clear, I\u2019m not saying we automatically assume a complaint of chest pain is fake. I always take it seriously and order the appropriate tests. But sometimes you kind of get a hunch\u2026they check in for knee pain, knee pain is the first pain they mention, and then they say \u201coh yeah and some chest pain.\u201d If you actually do have chest pain let us know!]**",

I work on both sides of that and we will always TRY and bring ambulances back to a room just like we do patients in the waiting room, but it goes by acuity not how you got there.\n\nHell most of the sickest patients I\u2019ve seen have driven themselves in or been dropped off. Gun shot wounds, heart attacks, farmer that got his arm cut off\u2026 \n\nAlso just because someone goes back before you doesn\u2019t mean we have room for YOU available. Sometimes we bring back low acuity patients first because we have \u201cfast track\u201d rooms open that\u2019s for minor cuts and scrapes. But we can\u2019t put a heart attack back there as the staff and rooms aren\u2019t equipped and monitored the same way as the \u201cregular\u201d ED. \n\nI\u2019ve had people say \u201cno take them back first they\u2019ve been waiting longer than me and they\u2019re sicker!\u201d. Yes I agree and we know that, but your room is the \u201cin and out just a closet in the back\u201d and they need the \u201ctrauma bay with all the things\u201d room. We are constantly rearranging to get the sickest back first where they need to go.",

Being a priority means you\u2019re in bad shape. Waiting sucks absolutely, but waiting means they triaged you and determined you\u2019re healthy enough to wait which is actually a good sign.",

The dilation reduces the pressure on the tissues from the hard stone that is causing a lot of pain. \n\nHopefully you don't have any more but if you do, take some extra strength Tylenol before heading in to make the ER wait more tolerable. Just make sure to note the time you took it and what the dose was so the hospital staff know when they can give you more. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675723004473",

I waited forever but I was already well taken care of plus I got medicines in the ambulance to stabilize my issue.\n\nEven for issues that aren\u2019t turning out to be life threatening, an ambulance is very important and may just be what saves it from becoming life threatening. It\u2019s a game of balance and the line is muddled who needs it and who does not. People have to make a decision on the spot, and that\u2019s the decision they make. I felt very bad the couple times I had to get an ambulance but it did turn out to be important. The shaming is out of control though\n\nEdit: CALM DOWN GUYS. I ACTUALLY HAD AMBULANCE FOR SERIOUS ISSUES. Like not being able to even stand on my own. My whole point is it\u2019s impossible to assess if you\u2019re in truly life threatening condition or not. If you end up needing an ambulance that is for a reason, and so be it. You guys are disgusting and are in the wrong to determine what is life threatening or not.

I thought, \u201cwhy am I walking like I\u2019m hammer\u2014 oh shit!\u201d Then I crawled to my nightstand to call myself an ambulance. \n\nFortunately it was just a minor CVA (cerebrovascular accident) and nothing more serious, so I was out of the hospital after five days of specialists ensuring it wasn\u2019t caused by anything other than my hypertension. It wasn\u2019t, and I was able to go back on with my life like that was just a minor inconvenience; I feel very lucky about that fact, because I\u2019d seen and heard from other stroke survivors whose lives were pretty ruined by their strokes, no more walking, talking, or even taking care of themselves.",

Your heartbeat isn't supposed to sound like Morse code, though, so my wife took me to the ER. When you say, \"My heart is beating randomly and I don't know why,\" you get seen very quickly. It is easy to verify, and they started IV lines to treat me, plus I spent the night in the hospital to see if I would cardiovert on my own (I did, about 6 AM).\n\nEarlier this year, I woke up after midnight to go to the toilet, and found I couldn't inhale when I got out of bed. We ended up calling 911. I tried putting my CPAP back on and got relief, but I still went with the ambulance to the ER, since I didn't know what caused this, or if it would return while my wife drove me in. As I was breathing OK, I got to wait in the waiting room, but it was early in the morning so it wasn't a long wait. Turned out to be Influenza A, which knocked me down for two weeks.\n\nI can fully appreciate the difference in wait times for different conditions.

I've had that a few times, myself.\n\nAfib can be caused by different things; for instance, marijuana use can trigger it in people who don't otherwise experience it. In my case, it was tied to some cardiac cells that had developed inside a vein to the lungs. These were just doing their own thing, and sometimes the signal from that got into the atria and caused them to quiver.\n\nMy first event felt a little odd, but my main symptoms were feeling tired and kind of excited. I didn't have another for a couple of years. Then I had one a year for a couple more years. Then I started getting it twice-a-year for a while. Then, one February, it jumped to three times a month. I ended up going to the Mayo Clinic, and it took two cardiac ablations to zap the area around that vein, in order to isolate those triggering cells. That was five years ago, and I haven't had an afib since.\n\nI was told that some people don't feel Afib at all. Me, it kind of felt like my heart was on rubber bands, bouncing inside my chest, like a worn-out elevator.\n\nThere are some smartphone apps which can help you measure your pulse. I was using a Kardia handheld Bluetooth device that produced a 6-lead EKG if I touched its third sensor to my ankle or knee while holding it with my thumbs on the other two sensors. With these things, I was able to keep a record of when I noticed my Afibs, and when they stopped. Since my ablations, the only odd heart feelings are *extra* beats that show up on rare occasions, but aren't a cause for concern.",

It all started because I have POTS and my blood pressure has always been so low that I have to warn nurses I haven\u2019t seen before because they get freaked out by how low it is. But something must have happened because in November my blood pressure shot up like crazy and it has been high ever since. I have gone into hypertensive crisis twice since November. I can\u2019t do much without it shooting up and then I have to lay down until it comes down and that\u2019s even on metoprolol! It\u2019s so crazy and I feel kinda insane lol.

I\u2019m extra vigilant, because when I wasn\u2019t it has had poor outcomes for my patients, and when I think about those ones it keeps me up at night. I made a vow to never show up to work under-rested or under-caffeinated. I\u2019m glued to my computer all day, running through algorithms in my head about what a certain combination of labs and vital signs could reveal. I try to strike a balance of doing right by people, while maintaining an emotional detachment, because if I don\u2019t I\u2019ll go off the rails and I won\u2019t be any good for any patients. \n\nSo I look at a CT of a patient who fell and hit their face and conclude that there\u2019s no need for emergent surgery, read the labs of a bleeding patient and conclude that she doesn\u2019t need a transfusion, get an ultrasound to ensure there\u2019s no retained products of conceptions, and after that I\u2019m done, ready to move on to the next patient.

Or, we go to Urgent Care if it seems appropriate. \n\nI have taken children in after hours for stitches and burn treatment (kid tripped into the wood stove). We might have had to wait for an hour or so.\n\nI have had 3 cases of RSV in my small children that resulted in hospitalization. They very first time, we tried the doctor's office first and got sent to the ER. The PA at the office showed me and explained the \"retractions\" of my child's chest. He said \"seeing is believing\" and told me to just lift my child's shirt when I approached the traige desk. He was right. That was enough. The last time I had a child sick with RSV, there was another awful outbreak going on and we sat in our tiny ER room for 36 hours before they got us a room upstairs. It was rough.\n\nThree weeks ago, I got off from my bartending shift (so, it was late) and slipped on black ice walking to my car. I fell against the edge of the sidewalk. I called one of my friends and asked them to drive me to my car. I was going into shock by the time they got there and they drove me to the ER. It was 2:50am when we got there. I told the triage nurse that I thought I twisted my ankle. They pulled my boot off and my leg flopped about 100 degrees outward. They had me in a room by 3, and an IV with pain meds by 3:15am.\n\nIt turns out I had fractured both my fibula and my tibia. Both had spiral fractures, in addition to a comminuted fracture of my tibia. They had me in surgery by 8:30, as soon as the orthopedic surgeon got there in the morning. \n\nThis is a for-profit, chronically understaffed hospital that left someone to die in the bathroom the very night I arrived (they pulled the cord and no one came until after the patient was dead). I spent another 2 nights at the hospital post-surgery. It was hell, because I was a \"fall risk\" with a bed alarm. However, I declined a catheter and the CNA was usually pretty overwhelmed so I felt like I had to pee the whole damn time. \n\nI never realized that they considered leg fractures to be so serious. My brother shattered his calcaneous a quarter of a century ago and Grady Memorial (in Atlanta) left him in the waiting room for like 2 days.",

If you're not dying, then they have no obligation to determine your actual affliction, because they have more important patients to tend to.  They should refer you to a PCP, if you're fortunate enough to have one.  \n\nBut if they had a PCP, they would likely not be using the ER to get a diagnosis. \n\nI can't imagine why anyone would want to stack imaginary medical conditions at the ER, when it's typically $250 to walk through the door and $50 for a tablet of aspirin.  If they offer you a warm blanket they might charge you $75 for it. \n\nWhen I was in the ER for heart palpitations thinking I had a major medical issue, they said I might be dehydrated and offered me an IV bag.  I refused, and I'm glad I did because the ER could charge you $700 to administer a $1 bag of electrolytic fluid when you'd get the same relief from drinking a large Gatorade for $3.75. \n\nNo fucking thank you, the only time I want to be in an ER is if I'm actually dying. And if I'm not completely sure,  I'll take my chances.  Because that's the kind of country we live in.",

But there's no law specifically saying you have to do those things. Source - i used to handle risk management for doctors offices and hospitals.\n\nI'm curious from your experience, what happens if the patient in your second bullet point just says \"i don't want those tests, I'm leaving\"?

I know what that feels like and this feels different.\u201d\nThey took me seriously. \nAfter their tests and me losing consciousness multiple times, I was submitted to the CCU, sepsis.\nThe nurses were so unjudgemental and actually talked to me about why I was ready to give up. \nMy day nurse asked questions and still helped even when I wasn\u2019t ready for it. \nMy night nurse treated me as if I were her daughter and acted as if I wasn\u2019t an addict and that made me understand I deserved more for myself.  \nIf she could treat me this well and fight for me as a complete stranger, why couldn\u2019t I? \nThose two nurses changed my entire life. \nI\u2019ve been sober for nearly 10 years now. \nNurses are truly a gift to the world. \nThey didn\u2019t have to do that.

Especially with an EKG, which sometimes only shows what the heart is doing *right now.*  I think of the heart as an unruly toddler, who might behave like an angel when Dad is on FaceTime but becomes a holy terror as soon as the call ends. Sometimes your heart looks good *right now* on the EKG but it may try some shenanigans later. \n\nOf course, maybe it\u2019s not a heart thing at all, just some achy ribs or spasming muscles or acid reflux. There\u2019s a good way to find out. Do you have a PCP? You can arrange a stress test. Basically they strap an EKG on your chest and put you on a treadmill and stress the heart a tiny bit by making you exert yourself. The EKG can show how quickly the heart runs out of oxygen when it\u2019s having to work a tad harder than normal. If there\u2019s anytime the toddler is gonna misbehave it\u2019ll most likely be then. A stress test doesn\u2019t rule out any and all heart problems, but it helps you figure out one of the more important things, which is whether your heart runs out of oxygen too quickly (which, if it gets bad enough, becomes a heart attack)\n\nA stress test may not be necessary if you\u2019re young, healthy, and have no risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But the older you get, the more risk factors you throw in, it becomes a better and better idea.",

The staff will get an EKG and if it\u2019s normal you\u2019ll probably go right back to the waiting room.\n\nI can confirm this from the patient perspective.  I went in to the ER one day with legit concern over a heart attack.  I always have some occasional minor pain and occasional numbness in my left arm due to a nerve issue, but I was having some chest pain and my arm felt worse than normal.  When I got there, I was maybe in the waiting room for a minute or two before they pulled me into triage to take vitals, an EKG, a blood sample, and start an IV.  EKG looked fine so they sent me back to waiting while they waited on the results of the troponin test.\n\nIt was probably an hour before I was taken to a room where they took an x-ray and said my troponin test was negative, gave me some  lorazepam in my IV, and said \"it looks like a panic attack so try to relax with the lights out and we'll keep an eye on your vitals and run another blood test in an hour.\"  They hooked me up to a saline drip and left me alone.  That was honestly the most relaxing hour I think I've ever had!  They took another blood sample that came back negative for troponin and sent me home and told me to follow up with my doctor.\n\nI wasn't the least bit upset with being sent back to the waiting room.  They confirmed it most likely wasn't something serious and prioritized my case correctly compared to their other patients.  I was very happy with how they treated me and am very glad it wasn't something more serious!  I had a lot of stress in my life in general, and my mom had just passed that morning too, so it all made complete sense.",

It wasn't until he started having seizures on the kitchen floor that my parents realized something was super wrong, and they called 911. I, personally, can remember him seizing and then following the firetruck flying through the hospital parking lot to the ER. I don't remember this part, but he ended up getting life flighted to the children's hospital. He was closer to kidney failure than I think we ever really know. \n\nI remember visiting him once or twice, but I bounced around family members' houses while my mother basically lived in the hospital with my brother. \n\nI'm incredibly grateful the ER staff realized how emergent he was and got him on that helicopter.",

It\u2019s triaging the sick from the not-sick, but also sorting the fast track people from people who belong in the real ER. Or maybe we have 1 room currently open so we skip over some sick-but-not-dying ones (bc they\u2019ll occupy that room for at least 12 hours) and pull back only the ones who can get in and out of that room relatively quickly. There\u2019s a method to the madness but it\u2019s hard to explain. \n\nGlad it worked out for your brother",

I literally thought I was gonna die (and really could have) and i finally get to the back. I know what I need that second is  iv fluids and insulin, that part isn't hard, but I wait in a \"room\" divided up with a curtain for like 20 more minutes, same condition and I'm just saying over and over \"give me salene\" (not sure if salene is the right word, but that's what I said.) and this dude behind some other curtain went out and started yelling that no one was helping me and I'm clearly in distress... At which point a lady finally walks in and says... \"can I get your insurance information?\" i flew into a rage that definitely didn't help and I threw my wallet at her and yelled again, \"give me salene!\" and finally a nurse came in and gave me a line and salene and insulin. It took like 1 minute for her to do that. Later after I was feeling better I asked why the fuck it took so long and I was told they were verifying my insurance... Which I gave them the second I came in... IDK if that's true or not or if this was just a really bad hospital but either way it took her two minutes to get what I needed, insulin and salene weren't that expensive(for what I needed at the moment) and it took them over an hour and a half to do that. They had no idea what condition I was even in and seriously bad,life altering or ending things could've happened to me in that hour and a half, but no, they needed verify my insurance information first. Im not in the Healthcare industry so I don't want to make claims I don't actually know about, but man, that situation still feels so fucked up. I'm still mad about it.  Insurance companies are out here deciding people's fate every day and they do so for a profit. That alone is an enormous problem.",
