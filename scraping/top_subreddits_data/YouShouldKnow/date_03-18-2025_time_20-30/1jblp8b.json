You need to secure those sheets and pillows asap because all the fluff and dust have time to settle in if you leave it exposed. Also if you have a dust mite allergy, you should be changing your sheets once a week & have hypoallergenic stuff (cotton, satin, any non synthetic fiber are best). I wash the sheets every 2-3 weeks because I have a few sets. The minimal moisture from your body throughout the night should not be getting to the point this should even be relevant & if it is, you should probably be changing your sheets every couple nights. \n\nSource: someone who has such a severe dust mite allergy my dr, who\u2019s been practicing for 30 years, said \u201cyou have the worst dust mite allergy I\u2019ve seen in 30 years. If this was the olympics, you have surpassed a gold medal\u201d lol\n\n\nEditing to add for all my allergy buddies: Cotton, satin, bamboo any natural fibers are best for hypoallergenic stuff, and they last a long time, get softer with each wash. Getting a netty pot or \u201cnavage\u201d nasal irrigation system help too. Getting an air purifier in the room you sleep as well.",

In my case I have a moderate dust mite allergy but paired with a deviated septum it meant most mornings when I woke up I could not breathe out my nose *at all*.\n\nThat was resulting in hugely diminished sleep quality (waking up tired) and making me generally feel like crap. I kept getting told to take steroidal nasal sprays, use salt water washes, anti-histamines, get my room to the right humidity, wash bamboo sheets regularly, special mattress toppers blah blah blah until eventually a doctor suggested the septum surgery which 95% solved my problems. I had a couple of bone spurs disrupting air flow, likely from an old teenage sports injury.\n\nI obviously still have hayfever and dust mite allergies but now it's just a sneeze or a runny nose. The airway still gets a little blocked but with it cleared / widened I can breathe normally in spite of the allergy.\n\nJust a thought for people. I imagine a similar logic applies if you have sleep apnea or other disruptions to the airway. It tips \"annoying allergy\" into \"cannot breathe properly\" territory.\n\nNaturally doesn't apply if the allergy is very aggressive and your airways are otherwise clear. You very much have my sympathy OP!",

So it covers your mattress and the places you've been sweating on the most, reducing airflow there and keeping it wet for longer. If you just swing aside your blanket and let it lay there, partially uncovering your mattress, it helps it dry. \n\nSo what I do instead is make my bed entirely, and then fold the blanket back in order to expose about 50% of the mattress, specifically the parts of it where you sweat the most, i.e. upper and lower body. So now the blanket is folded back, exposing the inside of it, on which you've been sweating as well, and only covering the leg and feet area of the mattress. \n\nOn top of that, as I make my bed, the sheets are pulled straight, and my pillow is made back into shape, all of which smoothens the surface area and probably increases the airflow on it. \n\nI don't know how the scientists went about testing this, but what you find when you Google this, it's just \"unmade bed\" VS \"made bed\" and the unmade bed wins. Which also makes for nice clickbait videos and articles. What they should've done instead is \"the healthiest way to make your bed\" or something, showing ways in which you can maximize the drying process by laying your sheets in certain ways.",

In both cases you need airflow.\n\nThe only case where this wouldn't happen is if you're biologically incapable of creating sweat, aka full-body anhidrosis which would be life-threatening since you can't regulate your body temperature.\n\nSo... \"get real\".
