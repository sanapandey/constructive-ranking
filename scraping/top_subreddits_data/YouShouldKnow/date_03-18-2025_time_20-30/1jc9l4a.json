A lot of critters develop limps because of an injured tendon, sprain, or injury to their paws. But if your pet starts limping without any reason you can identify, go to the vet for x-rays sooner than later. Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) is more common than people recognize and causes significant pain to the critter that you can't tell from palpations. If it is in the extremities, that can cause a limp or refusal of your pet to use that leg at all, and lead to a loss of muscle mass. Unfortunately it is fast spreading. If you can identify it before it spreads, amputation may save your critter's life and eliminate the pain. Don't wait to get it checked out if your buddy is not improving. Life on 3 legs beats the heck out of the alternative.",

Tuesday morning she's being scheduled to be out down on Friday as she developed cancer on the entire right side of her body, undetected until 24 hours earlier. No heads up, nothing, and my girl was gone...\n\nRIP Nimby \ud83d\ude1e",

We couldn't believe it. It was obvious in the X-ray his hip was gone even to us non medical people. A few days later he was gone. He was literally jumping over logs on our walk right before he started limping. Don't know how he was even walking in that condition",

Pet owners can\u2019t always tell if it\u2019s a sprain, soft tissue injury, etc., but that\u2019s the much more likely culprit than bone cancer. It\u2019s completely fine to wait 48-72 hours before taking them to a vet. If they cannot put weight on the limb at all, then go to the vet same day, but otherwise, you don\u2019t need to rush to the vet for a little limping for a couple of days.",

They're also good tools if you're measuring decline over a long period of time, since it can be hard to see changes when you live with the animal every day. (The scale I attached is from LSU, but there's lots of similar options from other vet schools that are equally good choices.)\n\n\nWhatever choice you end up making, I hope you know how lucky your critter is to have an owner that cares this much.",

Are they limping?
