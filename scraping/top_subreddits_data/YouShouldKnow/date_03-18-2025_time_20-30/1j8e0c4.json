    "selftext": "So while there are licensed dispensaries everywhere in legal states, there's 1 unlicensed dispensary for every 5 licensed.\n\nThe signs:\n\nThey sell tobacco products as well. That's a smoke shop. There's no one stop shop.\n\nThey don't even ID. Every legal state mandates dispensaries to ID everyone. They will eventually end up shut down.\n\nThey break local state laws. Examples: Ohio measures by the 10th not 8th. Some states don't allow the product on display. Some ID multiple times.\n\nThey sell clearly fake products. Examples: 1g or 2g hardware that the brand doesn't make. Or just counterfeits. \n\nThe prices are too good to be true. No 2g disposable will only cost $10. In some states 2g disposables are illegal as well.\n\nWhy YSK is because they sell sprayed buds and fake carts that could be laced.",
