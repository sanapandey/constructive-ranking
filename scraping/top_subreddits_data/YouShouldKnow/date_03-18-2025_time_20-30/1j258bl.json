It takes me about 30 seconds to get help your way over the phone versus 5-10min VIA Text to 911 because of how slow the conversation is.\n\nWhat I recommend doing if it is your only option, you text to 911 and say \"My name is KeyCorgi and I am at 1234 Wallaby Way, so&so is \"insert emergency here with detail\" as your opening line. We cannot get anything sent your way until  that address is confirmed so that should be the most important thing. The system usually gives us an approximate address of where you are but it is often not correct. For example it may say 1248 Wallaby Way when you are actually at 1250 Wallaby Way, and in a genuine emergency the time it takes to find where you are can make a difference.",

The newest of version of 911 (Next Generation 911) will have this as a feature; however, that won't happen until 2027-2028.\n  \nEven then, I agree with OP. It'll take much more time to get help vs. voice. Saying that, it'll be handy for those who are unable to speak in cases where the caller is hiding or may be in danger if their voice is heard (like a domestic violence victim, for example)\n\nEdit: this is Canadian only",

A text to 911 that just has an address and nothing else is not exactly going to be at the top of the priority list for responses unless it's an address with a lot of history. And it's definitely not getting a \"lights and sirens\" response if we don't have any other information about what may be going on. \n\nThere are thousands of different jurisdictions in the U.S. with different policies, and sometimes those policies vary MASSIVELY between jurisidictions that border each other, even. So there's a possibility that you'd get a lights and sirens screaming response on one side of a bridge, and a cop casually rolling through the general area kinda slowly an hour later if you're on the other side of a bridge. \n\nAlso, if I don't have ANY idea what's going on, I'm sending cops. Not EMS, not the fire department, I'm sending cops first. If your emergency doesn't require cops, well, you'll end up waiting longer.",

I used to be a call taker/dispatcher at my local EMS (that served neighboring small towns) and it was a pain to get accurate street names, sometimes they'd say very specific landmarks that only local residents of those small towns would know, like \"it's on the mayor's house street!!\" or \"it's right next to John's grocery shop\". Despite explaining I needed a street name, they would get very upset.  \n  \nFor context I live in Brazil, so different cultures , different protocols but I'm curious to know if that is something common in other places too",

He\u2019d intended to drive her to a local cemetery and kill her on her mother\u2019s grave (I heard him say this on the line). He had a gun on him. They were in a car and on the move.\n\nShe called 911 by holding down all the side buttons of her phone and triggering the emergency call shortcut. \n\nThe line opened up, I answered. She couldn\u2019t answer me directly, but she repeated the man\u2019s name over and over and kept asking him to let her go. \n\nMy agency has a few location tracking systems. One of them is the automated system that sends an approximation of your location based off the nearest cell phone tower. It\u2019ll usually include an estimation of how close you are to the location it\u2019s pinged (for us, it\u2019s approx 30-50ft) and you can keep prompting the system to send updated location data. That updated location gets sent directly to the officers, so they can see it moving as well. \n\nWe also have a system called RapidSOS, which is basically Google Maps with cellphone tracking data layered over it. It\u2019s FAIRLY accurate, but again, nothing is perfect, and the maps themselves are usually a few years out of date, so it\u2019s always best to confirm with the caller. RapidSOS actually shows a live feed of your cellphone moving over the map, and will keep tracking you for about 10-15 minutes after the phone disconnects.\n\nI never got confirmation, but she definitely had an earphone or something in, because she COULD hear me and was smart enough to give me information by talking to him (ex: I asked if she could tell me where they were headed, she began demanding to know where he was taking her) or by tapping her phone. Once for yes, twice for no. \n\nSo I could see her phone moving on the map, and would ask her yes or no questions to confirm her location. (Ex: do you see Walmart Supercenter to your left? Tap. Are you passing Main Street? Tap. Is he turning left? Two taps. Is your mother buried in Cemetery Name? Two taps. Is she buried in Other Cemetery Name? Tap, etc.)\n\nWith that, we were able to save her. \n\nBut say it\u2019s an open line with no communication. We still send someone to look. It\u2019s pretty rare that an emergency is happening without some sign of it being readily apparent, so if we get a call, no communication, but we can hear SOMETHING happening that clearly needs to be checked on? We use our best approximation of the location with the tools we have, notate to the officers where the location data is coming from so they know to canvas the area, and send them out. \n\nIt does happen where help is needed but we can\u2019t get a location. We do our best to exhaust all methods of finding a location, but if we don\u2019t know where to go, there\u2019s nothing we can do, sadly.\n\nEdit: we also just recently got a system that lets us send a text message to your phone, you click it, and it gives us your coordinates. I used this to get help out to some guys whose boats were sinking out in the ocean!",

However phone calls placed to 911 will go through regardless of whether that phone has an active service plan IF it can connect to *any* cell tower.\n\nThat means there may be situations where a Verizon phone is displaying that it has no service but there is technically an AT&T cell tower within range. In that case, the call will still go through. If there are *no* cell towers within range (not many places like that nowadays) then the call will not go through.

            "body": "Story time: \n\nWhen I was a hitchhiker one time I got picked up by a single lady. Kind of a biker looking chick, but driving a four-door sedan. Immediately after getting in the vehicle she starts telling me stories of her ex-husband and getting more irate with each sentence. This escalated into full-blown screaming about him, including some really insane stuff like how he shoved a shotgun in her p****. Every time her voice would raise, she would press harder on the accelerator. For the majority of the ride we were going 100mph+. Intermittently she would take drinks out of a coffee cup she had, and it didn't take long for me to smell The telltale scent of liquor. She was blasted drunk.\n\nI of course was terrified. She was clearly not well mentally, and very unstable. I didn't know what to do. I knew she needed to be taken off the road, but I can't call the police on her from her passenger seat, especially not in the state she's in. So I try to text 911. Which was immediately followed up with a response text telling me I cannot text 911 and I need to call...fml.\n\nSo I tried to dial 911 discreetly, and just leave my phone on sitting on the seat on my right side, and don't bring it up to my head. Hoping/praying that the operator will hear her tirade, and also hoping they have some way to track my cell phone. I was thinking perhaps they could figure out that I was moving down the freeway at 100mph+. \n\nAfter a few minutes of this strategy, I told myself it was most likely not going to work. So I hung up. Moments later 911 is calling me back. I thought \"great! I can play this off as an incoming call from like my mom or something.\"\n\nSo I answer the phone, and is nonchalantly as I can, I start dropping hints to the operator as to my situation. Where I was headed, what road I was on, the last mile marker post I saw, etc. The entire time the operator was just repeating \"sir, what is your emergency?\" Clearly missing all of the hints that I'm dropping her, including me literally saying \"yeah I could use some help.\" \n\nDespite all this she just continued asking what my emergency was. I was in shock that she apparently had no training in recognizing when a person was under duress. I got so desperate I dared to whisper to her \"I can't say right now.\" and she still couldn't figure out the situation. \n\nBy this point we had already made it off of the freeway (thank God), and the driver had pulled into a fast food drive-thru and was now directing her fury towards the person in the window. Realizing the vehicle had come to a stop I hung up the phone and  immediately opened the door and got out. \n\nSeconds later I get a call from the sheriff, and I give him the details and location of her vehicle. Turns out they were tracking me, because as that woman pulled out of the drive-thru her vehicle was swarmed by police cars and she was taken into custody. I continued speaking with the sheriff admonishing the 911 operator for not being able to understand that I couldn't tell her what my emergency was. I would have really appreciated if she was able to assure me that help was on the way.\n\nIn summation, you can imagine I'm really happy to hear that 911 is now accepting text messages. Fml...",
