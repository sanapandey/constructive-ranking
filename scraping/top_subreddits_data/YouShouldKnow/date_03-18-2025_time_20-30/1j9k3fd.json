I'm seeing deals where buyers are walking away with a sub 3% mortgage and still money in their pockets after paying the difference. Plus there's additional lending options if they HAVE to borrow it. Better to have a 80% loan at 2.75% and 20% at 7% than the full mortgage at 6%.",

They had owned the home for 10 years and had floated the idea of us assuming the mortgage.  We would have had to do a couple things to qualify:  pay at least 5% down to the bank for the remainder of the mortgage and pay them what they had already paid over 10 years.  We didn\u2019t have enough to pay them off completely and put 5% down on the remainder so that would have resulted in two different loans.  One at the nice low interest rate and another at a higher interest rate.  Our monthly payments would have been much higher than just going through with a normal purchase,  which is what we did.",
