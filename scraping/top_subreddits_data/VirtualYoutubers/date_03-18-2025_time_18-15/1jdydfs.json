I believe that because my YouTube channel was pulling 1k-20k+ on very niche non-shorts videos with only a hundred subs. Furthermore, despite only doing five total streams in my twitch account before pausing to work on shifting to a Vtuber, in all of them I broke out of 2 CCV, peaking at 9 in the final two streams. In fact, I was briefly affiliate eligible if I simply had followers. So clearly (at least I think) I can make content other people would interact with despite being a nobody. I'm also entertaining enough that in a discord community I'm most active in of \\~150 people, like half of their soundboard buttons are just audio clips of me lol\n\nThe problem is that I would never put out content that I wouldn't watch, and if I were to click go live right now, it wouldn't be a product I would be happy with. Advice I was personally given years and years ago by a successful creator was to \"pretend\" to be a bigger creator than I am, and the algorithm might make me one. Basically, people are more likely to click and more likely to be retained if I have the production and entertainment value of a larger channel and not the production and entertainment value of a normal 15 follower andy. When doing a mock stream to see where things stand, I always get a new idea, think of a new improvement, or notice something I don't like, and then I spend time fixing that instead of just going live.\n\nI think I'm maybe 80% of the way towards being satisfied for now though, we'll get there. My \"improvement ideas\" notepad file is down to ten things.",

I have to remind myself too that my favs weren't perfect in the beginning but it's hard because you see the current, best version of them right now. As for Obs, I had to figure it out too. I still change settings between streams but YouTube tutorials helped me \ud83d\ude17\n\nMy biggest hurdle though was my self-doubt. I almost quit from the beginning because of this but there were a few reasons that I decided to do it anyway.\n\n1. You only have one life. If you have the means to do what you love but don't take the opportunity then it's a waste of a life.\n\n2. Our favorites started years ago and had time to build up an audience + Covid helped them (a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity)\n\n3. You have to pick your battles. Life will be hard no matter what you do so you might as well do what you love. For me personally, I would rather experience the self-doubt and hardships that come with becoming a vtuber (that I can hopefully make into a career) or I can work minimum wage forever. Both are hard so I chose my hard, ny battles because it's my life at the end of the day and I don't want to waste it being miserable or asking myself \"what if\" \ud83d\ude0b",

That was over a year ago. \u00a0\nCurrently, I am making one as a commission, with vbridger and all that jazz, and with that experience I am going to make myself a new model for me.\u00a0\n\nAlso I have no idea what type of content I want to do.

When they\u2019re the ones who built everything lol (them being lolis themselves or lolicons).\u00a0\nIt really hampers what I want to do. Yeah, a lot are okay with it, but being so open about it will uhh close doors.\u00a0\nOfc I\u2019ve had the idea of having two accounts, the main one, limited uooh, and the other one where I would be open about it, just to collab with friends and such and have fun xdd.

Art, and video games mostly. I kinda wanna dable into the speed running category. I do play a loooooot of fortnite, but that games category is not really a good place to start or even stream. I have a decent pc, and a good mic, but the noise could be a problem, trucks from outside, and my roommate (but I can speak with them and ask them to be quieter when I stream).\u00a0\n\nAnd the fact that a lot of vtubers won\u2019t even dare collab with male vtubers, that is idiotic (some are justifiable, but still).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll stop here xd\u00a0",
