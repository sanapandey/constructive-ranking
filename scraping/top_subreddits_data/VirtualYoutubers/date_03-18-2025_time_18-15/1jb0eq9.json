I don't think people know what's involved in it. The director can see every camera's feed all at once and calls out which one is to be sent to broadcast to the switcher. I'd have to rewatch the VOD but I recall at least 12 physical cameras (6 per stage, with the cranes near the center of the venue being used for The Box) plus there were all of the virtual cameras, which adds another layer of complication (at least for me trying to figure the logistics of it since I don't know how the virtual cameras are operated). Imagine trying to parse out 15-20 live camera feeds and deciding on the fly which to use. \n\nI'm sure the director had some notes about each performance, but likely has little idea what the performer will actually do. Deciding on a camera to pick is very much a vibes in that moment of the performance. Cutting to the beat, using moving cameras that fit the current tempo, and other \"vibe based\" feelings. The girls could pre-vis their performance but that's just another layer of complication and rehearsal put on them and in my experience there's always problems when following a scripted pre-vis in a live setting, usually because the camera or performer have made their way out of position in that moment",

Dean*)\n\nThis bill is expanding that to all forms of obscenity, probably to target LGBTQ groups and/or violent content.",

You have less weapons anyway then any other weapon class in the game. You can choose elemental which I think is only Anja, or you can choose piercing which is congola until the Artian. \n\nI know I'm comparing this to worlds end game, but it's pretty frustrating. I really liked sticky HBG because you could focus on team play and doing KOs on monsters and letting your team feel like they were DPS monsters. Spread was nice especially for things you couldnt do peirce on and Peirce was very viable for things with length to shoot through like Kulve. It feels like a massive downgrade but at the same time it does have it's fun mechanics like Ignition, but only wyvern burst because Counter is far too complicated to use and burst/peirce are very limited in use.",

And it's mostly eurobeat inspired!\n\nReally, the whole reason why I say this is because back then she had shown interest in eurobeat, but she hadn't been fully allowed by whatever management there was to make an Eurobeat song, at least not yet. Then Project Hope dissolved and... She was free to do whatever she wanted. So of course she did Carbonated Love, a song born from a one-off joke. But it was a joke that showed she wanted to do more, and without whatever restrictions Project Hope had, she could.\n\nAnd it's not like Project Hope was bad, it did give us songs that still slap like Gravity, Moment of My Life and of course, Here Comes Hope and Caesura of Despair, which are referenced even to this day in the new EP's stickers. Even songs from Quarter Bravery and Journey got some love in karaoke after months, years, of not being heard in anything else but their studio-recorded form.\n\nAnd now, a whole EP that's full of Eurobeat? With a song by Motsu, THE Eurobeat guy? And Turbo, too, collabing in the EP? Writers and composers all around, working with her? She's come a long way since the end of 2022. \n\nHonestly, this feels like IRyS is taking back the VSinger title with a revengeance and showing everyone why she was chosen as the EN Singer. Being able to do what she wants poses challenges, but also opportunities ,after all. And I feel like it's just begun. I mean this is just an EP and it's already stacked. What else could she do with a full album?\n\nI mean... I don't think I've felt this much joy being part of a community like, in a long time. And it's nice to know that the time invested into this hobby finally paid off after years of waiting. And it could end at any moment, sure, the world could collapse tomorrow for all I know. But it's still nice, you know? That things like this can happen when you hope hard enough?\n\nAnyways. Tomorrow is Monday.",

Although from what I understand, it's not a complete music label like Calli's case, that is the talents have a bit more freedom but less comprehensive support. AZKi was also picked up by Victor Entertainment similar to Sora after transferring from INNK, in addition to Suisei's duo venture with Taku Inoue in Midnight Grand Orchestra under Toy's Factory (though Suisei herself is still technically \"indie\").\n\nBeing under a label does come with its own set of ups and downs though. While you do get the financial and promotional support, your future activities will also depend on how your music performs. If your releases under the label underperforms, then your future activities will be impacted/delayed. Depending on the contract with the label, you may also not be able to freely release songs or collab with others (like Calli initially iirc).\n\nThat's part of why those picked up by music labels are usually already quite successful themselves (Calli released an album prior to her joining UMJ). But then in Hololive, if you are already successful you can skip the label and still get Sololives, albums, high-profile collabs, and even partial financial support (like the project loans Moona received) while still retaining your artistic direction. \n\nThat's not to say there are no talents that wouldn't benefit from joining a label (I do think IRyS for example would benefit from it), but rather not all talents will see a need to join one. I think the ones who will benefit most are those that can fully exploit the connections provided (like Calli), or whose activities are lopsided towards Music (like Sora and AZKi a while back).",

In terms of raw talent, I would rate Risu higher for example, but it's not necessarily what a label is looking for. When you hear a song with Calli's voice in a blind test you instantly know that it's her. She makes a dramatic first impression. That's why UMG was interested in signing her. There are a few who might be able to get a solo contract with UMG, but they are probably better off making music through Hololive because they are already thriving at the top and have about as many perks but with other benefits, like Suisei.",

I especially don't want to nor will comment this on r/Kurosanji where dramatubers yoink threads and comments especially for this topic where they'll use it as ammo. \n\nFor a while now, we've known that dramatubers have formed their cliques, they've thought to themselves as some kind of avengers, that they're legit journalists (some of them think so) NEEDED in the industry to form a check and balance. The meme quote \"congratulations, you are being rescued, please do not resist\" comes to mind in recent times. After the NijiEN implosion, they have benefited and grown, so many more dramatubers and the so called reaction channels that consume said dramatubers have popped out.\n\n\nThis is in regards to the V & U talent that crashed out and made threats to dramatubers because they covered something despite putting a disclaimer not to do so. Yes it was dumb she did that, she's getting backlash as expected but the reception is so weird, the narrative the dramatubers are forming, the tactics they're using that they used for Nijisanji... They're making it out like V & U is massive, that the talent should be up to the standard of Corpo Vtubers when from what i heard, the girl is barely 2 view, that the agency with all it's flaws is some kind of Goliath and they the dramatubers are the David in this situation, the dramatubers thought they could be the knights in shining armor, trying to nudge the graduates or soon to graduate to spill some beans just because a massive leak happened, they think they could squeeze more out of them but when one of the talents they wanted to \"save\" crashed out and threatened them, they did a 180 and all of them and i mean ALL of them are hell bent on destroying the company especially the girl who crashed out, the girl apologized but she's easy pickings now, the 2 view Corpo girl Goliath will be smited by David's many boulders of harassment as retaliation. They didn't get their scoop so once again, they've concocted a drama themselves, reminder that everyday, they get told to eat shit and die by a lot of people especially the Nijisisters, this one time (actually not the first time, remember Twisty, Kuro, the many NijiENs) a tiny small corpo girl said fuck you to them, that she didn't want your coverage, they want to bury the girl",

I play it before on the playstation when I was younger and had good memories of it.\n\nThe only thing holding me back is the price. I can understand the pricing and willing to pay for remake such as FF7 and Yakuza 1/2 Kiwami (even if arguably the content for 1/2 is unfortunately lacking if you played zero first) because they changed the game/system (even though story and most content are the same).\n\nBut Remastered games are ... abit harder to justify for the jump in price imo since most of the time its just slightly better graphics (and maybe some QOL options). I understand that they are trying to charge modern day prices for older games by banking on the nostalgic factor (looking at you Lunar Remastered Collection that is coming out next month) but can't say I'm a fan of that.\n\nEdit: That said, if Xenogears was ever remastered and they fixed disc 2 speedrunning/lack of gameplay due to budget/time issue, I'll definitely buy it lol",

Now imagine if Cover agreed to give a talent her IP (either by selling or by goodwill), the logistic of disentangling all of that rights will includes needing to redo every (active) contract just to determine how the money will get to the talent in question before any other issue. A bunch of media will probably be removed (unless they negotiate a new contract to retain them in exchange for residue). Any active collaboration will need to switch business contact to the solo talent.\n\nThat's not to say it isn't possible, Suou Patra is probably the biggest case ~~(that i know of)~~, but I can see why bigger agencies would avoid thinking about it especially since the complexity will grew with their size and backlog.\n\nIt does makes me very curious about how the actual rights are handled at various agencies. Is it the case of:\n\n* Corp have all the rights and the talents are essentially voice actor/actress and the only things preventing the IP being used is personal respect\n* Corp have all the rights but the contract allowed some exclusivity clause that gives the talents minor rights like residue and no-revived IP without their participation or consent.\n* A Nintendo 2nd-party case where both Corp and Talents co-owned the character IP but the Corp have full trademark which allow talents dictate how their IP is used but only the Corp is actually allowed to make content with it.\n* Any other cases from Corp acting as steward but not own the IP (like with Vshojo) to IP rights written specifically in a way that could be sold,...",

I think Calli was told multiple times that she can't put any money to the production of song / mv which i think its because UM wants to own the song fully.\n\nBut with regards to the songs in hololive in which the production is done under the IP of the talent belonging to cover, but the production/mv is paid in significant amount by the talent ( through Yagoo Pay as they call it), does the actual person behind the talent not already own part of the IP of the song?\n\nIts a fascinating thing to wonder as a layman with regards to IP laws.",

Arguing that Mickey Mouse is a valueless IP without the original VA would get you laughed out of court.\n\nI suspect that courts will use animation IPs as the equivalent of Vtuber properties.    Especially if someone is owed money.  If they look for precedent for the IP having its own intrinsic value, we've also got Cocoa Damyoji of Blitz Wing as an example - they recast the voice after the first person was terminated. Even if we hate the idea, it is a precedent that the Vtuber is technically independent of the VA behind it.\n\nPixelLink is being pretty good with setting a low price (relatively speaking) for the property. We know of a few other examples, like Miori Celestia formerly of MyHolo 2nd Gen before she bought out the character and channel when they shut down the generation. While they didn't go bankrupt, there's precedent for setting the price at this level. Miori didn't ever say exactly what she paid, but I believe she did suggest it was roughly in this range.",

Assuming that she didn't even want to take along the IP of Serafi... and if she did then especially.\n\nThat's the only way I can imagine coming up with such a number unless it's literally just some arbitrary absurdly high contract penalty fee in the small print.\n\nSo I wonder if this is the boring and natural explanation for that number. I didn't really care about the drama concerning this back when it happened so I'll openly admit I have not dug into the details on this one. Perhaps I should for the sake of completeness.",

                    "body": "Consider the process of building an IP like Hololive and Aqua. You have a whole organization with staff, investors, talents, etc. for what's closer to a decade now pulling together as a team to build a family of entertainment brands and the business including the tech, market, networks and community around it.\n\nIn that context... what does it mean to give or sell an employee or a contractor the IP they were performing as? What would the company be selling? The rights to the model? No, clearly it's not just the rights to the model that would be going out of the door. What they'd be selling off is effectively a part of their whole business platform and market share in terms of the viewers and merch sales attracted by the vtuber as a part of the whole.\n\nSo how would they calculate the value of the slice of the business they'd be giving away or selling off? Why does it work for smaller corpos that are dissolving to either give away or to sell of the IP to the leaving talent? Because it's not worth that much, right? (I'm talking in terms of hard cold business and cash terms here for the sake of a point I want to demonstrate... not to devalue the her or her IP in any sense.)\n\nSo if for Raki from PixelLink it was 9k$ (just me assuming based off the goal she had for the donothon earlier) that she needed to buy off an IP with 30k Youtube subs, average views per vod being around 2k and the brand value of everything around it... how much do you think Aqua would need to fork out cash for something that's forever in peoples' minds connected to the Hololive brand plus a 2.2M subscriber Youtube account with vods that have lately averaged at least around 300k views each? What would the price be? \n\nAnd then there's still the brand risks with the Aqua brand being associated with Hololive but her no longer operating under the supervision and management of Cover... how would that realistically speaking work in practice? It doesn't seem like something one can really even put a price tag on... it is, as you say, entangled. Perhaps this too is so entangled that it's not worth the effort to even try to estimate.\n\nAnd then the next question could perhaps be... would that even be an investment worth the price for the talent? Let's say you were a highly successful corpo vtuber with a long history in the company. You end up wanting to leave because you've grown out of what you've been all those years and want to do something that doesn't fit the brand and the level of ambition of the corpo activities. How much cash would you be willing to fork out for the sake of the memories and emotional attachement you and your fans have to the model? You'd probably be considering how much you can make in your future activities with that IP, right? If the company said for example... half a million bucks to buy it out... would you be ready to go for something like that? How much would you have to make in your new activities for that to be a financially sensible trade-off?\n\nAnyway... I'm just a casual vtuber fan talking out of my ass so take everything that I say with a huge grain of salt.",

I guess the talents would like to retain as much as their IP and their presence in collabs as possible. Unless they have a very good lawyer by their side, the legal mess trying to untangle everything is probably not worth the effort with a big corpo.",

TTT was really left in the dust with nothing, and it got 2 our of the 3 people to actually graduate, one of which didnt even hold a graduation stream",

BTB's debut numbers shows that they are on the path of recovery, a mere 1 year after what happened to selen. what people should be looking out for is their numbers after and how they'll be able to attract newer fans knowing selen's termination.\n\nmy other hope is that in the timeframe between denauth and BTB, anycolor finally got their act together and actually fixed nijiEN's internal structure and management. but considering aster's situation and how his \"special announement\" stream keeps getting delayed, i dont have high hopes",

Now imagine the annoyance of having that on everyone's front page. Also being on the front page means actual people check you out, it's surefire way to stay on the front page \n\nOther than that for YouTube, sometimes, bots is also a negative, some antis do it to trigger YouTube to ban or punish the channels that it happens to.",
