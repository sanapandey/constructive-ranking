She befriended a small village, using her divine powers to turn their tears into hope. But tragedy struck one fateful night when a fire engulfed the village, taking away the home and friends she had come to cherish. Though the goddesses called for her return, Moki chose to stay, dedicating herself to bringing more smiles to Earth.\n\nNow, Moki creates a variety of content on YouTube! Since her 2.0 debut, she has expanded into a variety of games, meme ASMRs, and, of course, her \\*unofficial\\* Warframe Wednesdays. While she streams on a fairly consistent schedule in JST from her home in international waters, she strives to stream at times that many can enjoy! She\u2019s often confused and easily scared - but chat is always there to help her along!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co5aovmf6woe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=81050508163b59f7b073822fe5bde0119080c222\n\n# Trivia\n\n* Moki only deals with money in the bubble economy. All donations are converted to bubbles and her discord has games to play with fake bubbles!\n* Moki has a trusty water pup who sometimes disrupts stream. He will have a mascot one day!\n* Moki\u2019s favorite foods are raw fish, raw beef, and raw eggs- preferably eaten together! (\u3063\u02d8\u06a1\u02d8\u03c2)\n* Moki got her start on Twitch until she ate the cords to the servers underwater and they cut her off\u2026 now she\u2019s on YouTube! (Though desires to return one day soon..) But, if your internet goes out, you know who to blame..\n\n# Links\n\n* **YouTube:** [https://youtube.com/@moki\\_minami](https://youtube.com/@moki_minami)\n* **Twitch:** [https://twitch.tv/moki\\_minami](https://twitch.tv/moki_minami)\n* **Twitter:** [https://x.com/moki\\_minami](https://x.com/moki_minami)\n* **Tiktok:** [https://www.tiktok.com/@moki\\_minami](https://www.tiktok.com/@moki_minami)\n* **Discord:** [https://discord.com/invite/RWh8ubjkYa](https://discord.com/invite/RWh8ubjkYa)\n* **Throne:** [https://throne.com/mokiminami](https://throne.com/mokiminami)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyhqrgtg6woe1.jpg?width=1999&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=767e03bf747127faabe440746f25953257d11c4b",
