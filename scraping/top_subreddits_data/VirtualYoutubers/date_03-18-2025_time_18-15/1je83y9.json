It's fine to have \"heroes\" or look up to others, not to be like them but to as a reminder we can all fly high. At the end of the day, they are just like you and me, people, humans, not gods. And definitely I don't have true feelings for them, just respect, since they are bringing smiles and good laughs to others, just like I want to do!",
