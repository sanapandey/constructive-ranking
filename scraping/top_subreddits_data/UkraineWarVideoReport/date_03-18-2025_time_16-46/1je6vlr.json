I understand that the ruZZians are doing this more to confuse the Ukrainians. To me that's a desperation measure as the Ukrainians' superior command and control make them less likely to be fooled. Using UKR tape colours are more likely to have these ruZZians targeted by their own adjacent units and drone operators.",
