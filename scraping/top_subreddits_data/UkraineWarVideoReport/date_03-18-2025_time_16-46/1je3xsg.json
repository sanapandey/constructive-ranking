All turkey cares about is increasing their standing in europe without having to concede on anything that matters, and neutering russias black sea presence so turkey has less military/strategic competition. Meanwhile, turkey is still the major conduit for supplying russia with European goods, and supplying europe with sanctioned russian goods (outside of the major sino-european trade and direct euro-kazak, etc explosion in trade).\n\nEdit to add: when will turkey recognize Armenia, Greece, Cyprus, Syria, and Israel's sovereign rights to not be invaded/forced to cede land or territory, or their right to fight back? Don't even get me started on their views on Sweden's sovereign right to harbor certain refugees, while turkey invites hamas to strategically operate from Ankara. Or inciting Turkish mobs to assault or harass American NATO forces while on leave in Turkey. Or turkeys views on operating state-controlled mosques all over europe to preach the ruling party's political agenda abroad. \n\nWhile this specific news is good for ukraine, it being good for ukraine or even international law is incidental compared to how it can benefit turkey, and we should not assign motives to turkeys foreign policy that don't exist.",
