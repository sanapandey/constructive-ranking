Blue bands. We are going to use them when making our assaults. We put these on, go on the task, clean the positions and fix there. Then we remove these bands. We don't put the bands on our helmets only, to let our drones know where we are and where the enemy.",

However that wasn't the official plan.

Now you ask yourself about the United States of America, same thing. Everybody likes to look at American think all those stupid Americans. Guess what guys we're not all stupid and it's our elected officials that are in the corrupt ones. The average American is disgusted by this whole entire conflict between the Ukraine and the Russians. The average American just once what are Constitution promised life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Tell me who's the first nation to operate when something like an earthquake or tsunami it's another country.? Yes that's right the United States of America. Why would that be? It's because we as a nation are very caring of everybody around the planet. We're not warmongers and we certainly don't think anybody should die over precious earth metals or oil or anything else that people think we only care about. Truth is we care about our families our friends not a lot much else. I just wish that there was no war. I wish we all could get along but if we had to disagreement that each country would send their biggest baddest person to a boxing ring and let those boxers decide who wins the war. That way we all save on the money it would take to put together or financial War. Nobody had died. Don't you guys think that would be a better option than to kill our fellow man?",
