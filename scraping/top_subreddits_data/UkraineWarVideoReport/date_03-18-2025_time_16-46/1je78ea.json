The war has been going on since 2014 - anyone with a will can inform themselves. The acquisition and use of VPN is not prohibited in Russia, ergo the argument of blocking information sources does not hold water. Last but not least, I even agree that he is basically a victim. A victim of his government. I strongly suspect that he was a simple conscript. These guys are often coerced into signing a contract. Sometimes by force. \n\nBut Russian society is not just made up of 18-year-old guys. If you are aware, the Ukrainian Maidan actually started very small, 2000-3000 students. Yanukovych made a bad decision and had the young people violently attacked by his Berkut. What happened after that? Society did not accept the fact that its youth was being beaten up. Where is the outcry in Russia? Where are the mothers, as in the first Chechen war? All in all, society put up with it. I even anticipate the arguments - police, jail, etc. Doesn't matter, it's a nation of 140 million people.

That was based on a study that just looked at brain development until the age of 25 and found that the brain kept developing into people's 20s. Doesn't mean it's \"done\" then and \"not done\" before, there's a LOT of variability there and there's neuroplasticity at all ages. But unfortunately this has already been turned into a million clickbait articles so it's a just huge misconception now.\n\n[BBC article](https://www.sciencefocus.com/comment/brain-myth-25-development) [IFL science](https://www.iflscience.com/does-the-brain-really-mature-at-the-age-of-25-68979) [slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html)\n\n18 year olds are just pretty immature because they don't have a lot of life experience yet.\n\nEither way this is fucking tragic, that guy is a child to me. I don't think anyone is saying that an 18 year old soldier isn't a normal combatant and thus a legitimate target, but it is fucking sad that he's there. A lot of people need to get off their high horses of \"well I'd never fall for propaganda!\"",
