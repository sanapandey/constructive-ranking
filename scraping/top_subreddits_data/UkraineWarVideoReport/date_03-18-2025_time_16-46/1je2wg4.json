Many of our fellow citizens from former Russian occupied East Germany haven't still become democratic people, although they enjoy all it's benefits and freedoms for like 30 years now. They and their children (still) have a strong tendency to dictatorships. They want the \"strong man who is solving all problems\" and want to \"feel great again, only by being German.\" They love Trumps circus.... so if Putin is allowed to keep those regions,  his war was successful in every single regard. 1mio orcs lost, several mio smart people won. Access to the Black Sea, access to the minerals and industrial complex in Donbass.... F**ck",
