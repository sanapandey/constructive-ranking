There's a reason why Rubio got so belligerent about being asked if Republicans are supporting Russia outright in this war. They know it is wildly unpopular and some of them, including Rubio don't trust Russia. \n\n2. The MIC here in America has got to be getting restless. I think they realize by now that Trump duped them or didn't realize pulling Ukraine support would spur European defense contractors and hurt them. I suspect they are quietly reminding Trump behind scenes that going soft and losing even more ground to European Defense companies is not going to sit well with them.\n\nTrump and MAGA Republicans have a hilarious misunderstanding of global geopolitics. Putin and Russia's ambitions are obvious. The fact that Trump keeps trying to negotiate with Putin and saying that he wants EU troops on the new boundaries as peacekeepers is a tell to that.",
