These acts cannot go unpunished.\n\nPublishing peoples private information is against Reddits rules however below we have provided links to submit information and footage of war crimes and the perpetrators to The Hague.\n\nThe Hague:\n1) By post to:\u00a0\nInternational Criminal Court\u00a0Office of the Prosecutor\u00a0Communications\u00a0Post Office Box 19519\u00a02500 CM The Hague\u00a0The Netherlands\u00a0\n\n2) By email to:\u202f\nhttps://otplink.icc-cpi.int/\n\n3) By fax to: \n+31 70 515 8555\n\nThanks again for the support and keep up the good work!",

Should someone complain that we're allowing users to ignore the rules, they could shut down the sub.\n\nAnd that would suck. Trying to do good, and our sub and it's mods get punished for it.\n\nSo, please cut him some slack and let us keep on doing the good work of reporting the war, including war crimes. Let them (the mods) keep this sub going.",
