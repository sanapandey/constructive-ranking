I learned from one of the civil engineering guys that the reason they do pre-emptive coning or aggressive blockages is to make sure traffic in the area can continue to function and to give those driving the mental prep of \"there's gonna be people here soon, be careful\". \n\nThey're supposed to readjust until traffic isn't heavily impacted and then start working but usually they just start anyways",
