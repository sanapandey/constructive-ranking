Where did I mention support of anything? Someone mentioned that it's censorship and I explained why I disagreed, and then you made a comment suggesting that there is no difference between sharing a screenshot and sharing a link, and I again explained why I disagreed, pointing out the negative affect towards X that such a policy could have by hitting them in the revenue (which is done by banning links, banning screenshots wouldn't have the same effect). It's the policy that's being adopted across multiple subreddits, I didn't create it \ud83e\udd23\n\nDo you skip every other sentence when you read and then just imagine what's said to fill in the gaps or something?",

I think Elons super right wing though, he\u2019s openly supported the AfD, a far right party in Germany who\u2019s had multiple scandals where they like to regurgitate Nazi slogans and rhetoric. You can go on Twitter and literally see neo Nazi accounts praise what he did during the inauguration with shit like \u201cwe\u2019re so back\u201d and \u201cwe rise\u201d. So no, I don\u2019t think Elons a Nazi, but he sure does like appealing to them!\n\nAlso, keep defending him! He\u2019s definitely looking out for the average American citizen and totally isn\u2019t lining his pocket with government subsidies and taxpayer money so he can buy another POE2 account and claim it\u2019s him!",
