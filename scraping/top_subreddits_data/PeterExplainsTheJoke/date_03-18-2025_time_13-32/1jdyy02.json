These are the things an autistic person can rant about for hours, days, or even months without end.\n\nMany, if not most, autistic people, tend to be fascinated by some sort of human-invented mobility (bikes, trains, cars, planes, boats, flying hovercraft, Ben&Jerry's). By far the most popular of these is the train.\n\nTo simplify, autism see big loud metal cube with predictable path laid right in front, autism happy.\n\nAutistic peter out.",
