    "selftext": "Hi old chums! Mayor Adam West's ghost here to tell you about some exciting new developments for the subreddit.\n\nFirst of all, we've hit 1 million users! That's 1 million people who want jokes explained, or 1 million mouth breathers who don't get the most basic jokes if you believe the whooshers. Don't believe the whooshers. Report them and we'll ban them!\n\nSpeaking of banning. We have a whole new team here to help with managing the subreddit! Welcome to:\n\nu/THEpeterafro\n\nu/wonderwallpersona\n\nu/Ponjos\n\nu/JollierYT\n\nu/kyleparker134\n\nu/Fizzhaz\n\nu/FedMates\n\nu/ThePlayerCard\n\nu/Theshogunnate\n\nu/Particular_Depth4841\n\nu/starlight_collector\n\nThey're the ones who made it through the full process. Welcome to all of you! It's a big team, but this subreddit has grown a lot so we needed something to balance things out.\n\nAlso a special shoutout to u/lolnoizcool. He was added to the mod team about half a year back and has been a huge help sniffing out bots and spammers and helping with the overnight. We didn't do a post back then because it was all we could do to keep up with the queue.\n\nThanks for 1 million users, old chums! Here's hoping for many more. Mayor Adam West's Ghost out!",
