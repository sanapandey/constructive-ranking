You don't often set things to an absolute position if you, have a row of blocks as the screen gets narrower, you can set them to wrap a bit like how text does. So on a wider screen it would look like a 2 colum grid and on a narrower one a single column. Always dipslaying all the content. \n\nLike code in general is very automatic, you just need to know how to describe the behaviour you want and then you can typically abstract out the complex thing into simple lines of code.\n\nAlso what the commenter youre replying to means when they say it will always fit is like content set to display on the screen will typically resize to always display on the screen. The worst case is it like is off screen with a scrollbar and that's called overflow. Html css is literally designed to always display all the content by default by automatically scaling the size and adding scrollbars etc",
