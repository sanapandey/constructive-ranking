    "selftext": "Hi. I'm the guy surfing New day in day out looking for reposts. I'm going to post some of the most common ones in this thread as I come across them.\n\n# [Why does Peter explain the joke?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/peter-griffin-explains-the-joke)\n\n# [Cow Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/141u2cj/go_ahead_explain_it/)\n\nPer u/[cthulhuscradle](https://www.reddit.com/user/cthulhuscradle/): The creator of the comic confirmed that the joke is \"if cows made tools they probably wouldn't be very good\"\n\n# [Guy named Ice](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainTheJoke/comments/1e0pu48/ice/)\n\nPer u/HorseStupid: It's a [\"Kid Named Finger\"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kid-named-finger) type meme, where the punchline is irreverent to the set up.\n\nA joke that may be the original for this punchline may be like, \"Crush: All I want is Ice Cream / Guy named Ice:\"\n\n# [Hey rabbit population, how's it going?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/1ff0oii/i_dont_usually_post_here_but_like_huh/)\n\nPer u/umikali: Hey, Chris here. The thing in the right top is a mathematical curve, which has many connections to other fields, from physics to biology, and that curve represents the reproduction factor to the stable population of rabbits, veritasium made a great video about this :https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk\n\n# Last night I IMAGE MEMED your sister\n\nThese are usually nonsensical posts that have no meaning. An anti-joke.\n\n# [The numbers 10-99 are called the double digits. Memorize them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/1axcdit/i_dont_understand_this_at_all_am_i_dumb/)\n\nPer u/13thFleet: Think of it like a parody of life pro tips. It's a silly scenario where a guy doesn't know something obvious and tries to help people learn it.\n\n# [Oreos and attractive starlets](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/16rbfee/peter_what_kind_of_cookie_is_that/)\n\nPer u/Zuzara_Queen_of_DnD: The images are metaphors for what the women\u2019s inner and out vulva look like\n\n# [Philosophy people disproportionately look like evil villains](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/16jdnra/wut/)\n\nPer u/ThenaCykez: Peter here! The character at bottom is Chidi from *The Good Place*, a philosophy professor who has died and entered the afterlife. He has severe anxiety and indecisiveness. As in the picture, he gets a stomachache whenever he has to make an important decision because it takes him hours as he considers his philosophical principles. Spoiler:Although he thinks he is in heaven (\"the good place\"), he later learns he is actually in hell (\"the bad place\") because his overthinking had made everyone in his life miserable, and he never did anything good with his [life.So](http://life.So) maybe OP is saying \"You're not going to like the answer: most philosophers ARE villains.\"\n\n# [You're Whale Come](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/16suv11/peetah_what_did_th_whale_say/)\n\nu/[whitecholklet](https://www.reddit.com/user/whitecholklet/) with the explanation on this one: Hi , Peters Surfing bird album here, After someone says \u201cthanks\u201d it\u2019s common to say \u201cYour welcome\u201d The joke is \u201cyour whale cum\u201d ie the baby way was made with whale cum",
