All forms of energy under general relativity bend spacetime and exert a gravitational pull. This includes potential energy.   \n  \nIn intro physics classes, you learn that an object on the ground has less potential energy than that same object 1m above the ground. This is because gravity is uniformly an attractive force.\n\n99% of the mass of a proton isn't even the mass of the three quarks, it's in the binding energy of the gluons and strong fields.\n\nBut in the case of the electric field, two positive charges have a lot of potential energy when they are forced very close together rather than by being far apart like with gravity. So, it costs energy to force two positive charges close together. And if you let them, they will push each other apart at high speed, that energy for that acceleration had to come from somewhere. It came from potential energy stored in the electric field.\n\nSpecifically, the equivalence is the old famous E=mc\\^2. For every joule of energy you add to a system, there is a corresponding change in the amount spacetime gets bent that acts like mass. So, while positrons have the same rest mass as electrons in a vacuum, the mass of a proton plus an electron in the lowest orbital is not the same as a proton plus a positron right next to it because a proton plus an electron has no additional potential energy stored in the electric field. The electron is already in the lowest possible state around that proton. It's already \"on the ground\" so to speak. But if you replace that electron with a positron, now the forces between them are repulsive rather than attractive. The positron is now in the HIGHEST possible state it could be in with respect to that positron. It has a massive amount of potential energy.   \n  \nNot only that, but once you replace ALL the electrons with positrons, now all the protons are in very high potential energy states with all the other protons. Before, they had the electrons around to balance them out so that each atomic nucleus felt approximately zero electric force from every other nucleus. Each atom was neutral. There was nearly zero potential energy stored in the electric field (not accounting for energy stored in chemical bonds). But afterwards, every single charged particle in the entire moon is now the same charge and all very close together. The amount of potential energy is absolutely staggering. And yes, according to general relativity, all that additional potential energy will act like mass and have a corresponding effect on the bending of spacetime.\n\nTL:DR if you somehow had a proton and a positron bound together temporarily, that system actually does weigh more than a proton and an electron bound together even though the rest mass of positrons and electrons are the same. This is because potential energy is still energy and all energy exerts a gravitational force under general relativity.",
