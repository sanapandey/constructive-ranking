But in this case with the two blue eyed islanders both of them do not commit suicide the first night as they see can see one blue eyed islander. However after they wake up they see the blue eyed islander did not commit suicide, this means there must be another islander with blue eyes. But as he can only see one it means that the other one is himself so he will commit suicide (and the other blue eyed islander as well). The same logic applies to any number of blue eyes, just takes more nights but the logic is the same.",

They all know each other's logic and know at what level the blue eyes will break down.\n\nIf I see 1 blue eye and he doesn't leave on the 1st day, I know I have blue eyes.\n\nIf I see 2 blue eyes and both don't leave on the 2nd day, I know I have blue eyes.\n\nThis CAN continue forever because they ALL go through this logic and they all know everyone else goes through this logic and logically, the only reason N-1 didn't leave on Nth-1 day is because I am also one of them. They would all come to the same conclusion at the same time.\n\nIf I see n blue eyes and they don't leave on the nth day, I know I have blue eyes.\n\nThis is a pretty well agreed upon logic puzzle.",

Knowing three blue eyed people requires the logic of only two blue eyed people existing, which works in a three eyed scenario. In a four blue eyed scenario it relies on a three eyed scenario working, and we\u2019ve established that the three eyed scenario can be solved by relying on the two eyes scenario working, except now the two eyes scenario can never work because there will always be a minimum of three blue eyed people and so you can\u2019t use the logic of the two person solution.

When nothing happens the first day they realize that the other blue eyed person can see another blue eyed person, so they must be that second blue eyed person.  A brown eyed person isn't surprised that nothing happens the first day because they know that everyone can see at least one blue eyed person.\n\nFor three blue eyed people each sees two people with blue eyes so they're like the brown eyed people in the 2-blue scenario.  They're unsurprised when nothing happens the first day, then they think \"if those two are the only two blue eyed people then day 2 is the day.\"  When day 2 comes and goes they realize it's more than 2 blue eyed people, so they must have blue eyes.  Again, a brown eyed observer is unsurprised that day 1 and 2 were uneventful.\n\nThis pattern continues indefinitely.

So B1 knows he must have blue eyes himself, and kills himself a day later. \n\nFor the case of 2 blue eyed people, B1 and B2, it's still easy to understand: All brown eyed people see 2 blue eyed people, however B1 and B2 only ever see one blue eyed person. \n\nOne day passes, and no-one kills themselves. Thus B1 realizes, that B2 must also be able to see another blue eyed person. Since B1 sees no other blue eyed person besides B2,   he knows that he himself must have blue eyes. \n\nB2 has the same realisation, both kill themselves one day later. \n\nThis would also ? probably? result in all brown eyed people killing themselves one day after the blue eyed ones. \n\nFor everything larger than 2, it gets increasingly harder to grasp intuitively, but this is what the induction proof is for.",

A gradient is the version of this you use when your function has more than one independent variable. Towards the end of the calculus sequence of courses, so in calculus 3 at most universities, one of the last topics is vector calculus. This includes some stuff on vector fields. A vector field is said to be conservative if it is the gradient of some function.",

Let me give a shot at explaining it because I feel a lot is left implied:\n\nThis is logic, so we need to understand how to symbolize what\u2019s going on. Let\u2019s name the statement \u201cBoy loves girl\u201d as \u201cB\u201d and the statement \u201cGirl loves boy\u201d as \u201cG\u201d. Both statements B and G are falsifiable (Boy may not love girl, girl may not love boy), we don\u2019t know yet though as only Boy and Girl know the truth of statements B and G respectively.\n\nTo symbolize the question of \u201care you two are in love\u201d we need to define a relationship between B and G - specifically using an \u201cand\u201d operation. To symbolize this, we would make a new statement \u201cB & G\u201d. What this means is the entire statement \u201cyou two are in love\u201d is only true if and only if both B and G are true. For example if Boy loves Girl, but Girl does not love boy, the statement \u201cYou two are in love\u201d would then be false. You need both with an \u201cand\u201d operation.\n\nIn the second panel we are now evaluating the truth of the statement \u201cB & G\u201d. We start with the first part of the statement: B. Since for it to be true, both B and G need to be true, if B were false he would be able to say the statement \u201cB & G\u201d is false. For him to not be able to answer means that B must be true, we just need to evaluate G.\n\nThe final panel just shows the girl blushing at the implications of his uncertainty as it means B is true and Boy does love Girl.",

Since it's an or statement, if statement A is \"are you two in love\" and statement B is an unknown, that would imply that if he knows they're in love the statement evaluates to true, and saying he doesn't know would imply the value was dependent on the \"something\", and that would only matter if they weren't in love.",

If S were true, he would have said yes. Assuming he does know the actual truth value of S, the only way he would say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is if both S were false and B were true. Girl blushes if B is true, so the same stands.  \n\nIf he didn\u2019t know S then sure you\u2019re right, but I\u2019d argue given the framing of the question he must know S - we\u2019d just have to do some interpreting as to what S is. Given the question is about the relationship between Boy and Girl, we should assume S is some substitute for B & G where the word \u201clove\u201d has been swapped out for something else (i.e. Boy likes Girl, Boy is attracted to Girl, Boy lusts after girl, etc). Point being the \u201csomething\u201d is to due with the ambiguity of the word \u201clove\u201d and not \u201cboy\u201d, \u201cgirl\u201d or the relationship between the two. That something should be love adjacent though - something \u201clove-ish\u201d or \u201clove-like\u201d.  \n\nContinuing with that thought we can tweak the symbolization of that \u201csomething\u201d statement to be a stand in for \u201cBoy *somethings* Girl\u201d and \u201cGirl *somethings* Boy\u201d as B(s) and G(s). The whole statement becomes \u201c(B & G) || (B(s) & G(s))\u201d and we can go down the same logic as before, just now we know either \u201cBoy loves Girl\u201d or \u201cBoy *somethings* Girl\u201d where something is part of a set adjacent to love. Girl still blushes given the implications.",

If p is true then it could be true, as in line 1, or false as in line 3, so he can't know, but his lack of knowledge reveals his feelings to the girl, who would then be able to say yes with confidence.\n\nIronically this joke is broken by the addition of \"or something\" at the end of the question. This changes the logic to look like this p\\^q\u2228r with r being 'something'. Because something is always the case, the statement as a whole is always true - they might hate each other, they might love each other, but something.",

It\u2019s possible he doesn\u2019t know because he doesn\u2019t know her feelings. But it\u2019s ALSO possible that he doesn\u2019t know because he doesn\u2019t know his own.
