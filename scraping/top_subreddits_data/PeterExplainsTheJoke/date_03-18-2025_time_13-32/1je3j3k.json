It is highly volatile, unstable, and severely prone to hacks and cyberattacks - and it\u2019s literally responsible for the majority of what we rely on in our day-to-day lives.",

                            "body": "I was working a software job and the call came down that a new regulation on our sector required logins to use 2FA (like how when you log in, you get a text on your phone, and have to enter a code).\n\nWhen we first implemented it, it made it to production with a \"bug\" because it just wasn't finished. It would send you a text message and ask you to enter a code, but it didn't matter if you entered the right code, it would just let you in even if you entered nonsense.\n\nAt first, my manager panicked a bit, because there was a compliance certification coming up for that included this feature, and wanted to rush a fix to production.\n\nTurns out that both his lawyer AND the person in charge of compliance certification took a \"monkeys paw\" interpretation of the regulation, in that it didn't specifically state that the 2FA codes had to match. It specifically stated that a text message had to be sent to a registered phone number, and they had to be presented a box to enter it into, but the language of the regulation never actually stipulated anywhere that the code had to match anything.\n\nSo the software was certified compliant and went to production with 2FA that LOOKED like it was working, but was really doing nothing. None of our customers complained because there were only a few dozen that actually used this login endpoint, and all of them just always entered the right code without noticing a thing.\n\nIt took months before the developer who originally wrote the 2FA to get around to actually being able to prioritize fixing this, because, believe it or not, he was busy dealing with even more pressing fuckups.\n\nOnce you see this kind of thing, you see it everywhere. It's literally everywhere. Most software is pure crap.",

As Sears continued to struggle, I kept thinking of that ancient system and decided they had lost their way.",
