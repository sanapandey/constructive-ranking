If it's an elderly parent who's physically healthy, but can't recognise her adult child, it's Alzhiemer's. Probably not what the creator was aiming for, though.\n\nSo what this ends up being is a case of reader's experiences shaping the lens through which they see the comic. There's no absolute wrong or right here. Someone else who's also got a lot of experience working with Alzhiemer's patients might also agree that is one way you could interpret the comic. \n\nA contract lawyer might disagree with all of us and say the wish can't be legally fulfilled because the wishmaker is offering something they don't own the intellectual or creative rights (and similar being true for the woman wishing to be young again).",

And the length of the wish is determined by how precious the thing you sacrifice is to you. Hence the mom sacrificing her son's life for youth, and being told that her wish will be fleeting since she obviously put such a low price on her child's life.\n\nSo our main character sacrifices his mother's memories. He'll remember her, she won't remember him, and he'll have to deal with that for the rest of their shared time: a permanent repeating cost. The woman we see at the end that he talks to is his mother; she's well and healthy and doesn't remember her son at all, despite them having a shared necklace. So the kicker is that when she asks \"how's his mother\", he's crying as he looks at her (his mother), and can honestly answer that she's well.",

It's about what it's worth to YOU. That's the point. It's not about ethics and morality. It's about what gives something it's true value",
