But he was in no way horrible, evil, bloodthirsty, or demented.  He hated Victor for his abandonment, that is correct and the reason for his first killing (Little brother William).  That was not so much an intentional or planned murder, but a blind rage reaction.  \n\nHe was willing to set aside his hatred for Victor by asking for some form of atonement from him.  He gives him two chances.  His First chance is to save the nanny by acknowledging what he did.  Victor refuses.  The second chance is creating a \u201cbride\u201d so the creature doesn\u2019t have to be alone anymore.  He even goes so far as to promise that he and the bride will go away and never interact with people again.  Again Victor refuses.\n\nNow knowing that he faces a life of loneliness and isolation, he vows to do the same to Victor and kills anyone close to him.   This was not the course of action he initially wanted.  He would have avoided it completely if Victor acknowledged the creature\u2019s loneliness and abandonment and tried to help him.  It was Victor\u2019s cold indifference to the creature\u2019s isolation, that drove the creation to make the decision to make Victor as isolated from\nHumanity as he was.\n\nThere is the real tragedy here.  The creation wanted someone to either end, or share in the pain of his isolation.  His actions were not guided by a drive to kill or harm, they were driven by an internal pain that he didn\u2019t want to bear alone.",

Now Frankie, since we've read the story unlike the artist, is misunderstood and honestly, probably will do more good just being scary than anything. He won't attack unless provoked either. So yeah I'd rather have Frankie the Crime lord than a cop.",

Some nut-job shows up at your kids school and starts murdering children. Then here come the cops\u2026 to what? Stand in the hallways looking at their phone while kids scream and gunshots go off in the same building? To fight and arrest parents trying to save their own children from a murderer?\n\nHmm\u2026 okay okay. So home invasions and mass shooters are a bust for cops. What about detectives? Those are cops that solve murders. Good guys right? Wait- you\u2019re telling me only [roughly half](https://projects.csgjusticecenter.org/tools-for-states-to-address-crime/the-accountability-gap-unsolved-violent-crime-in-the-united-states/) of murders in the United States are solved? \n\nOkay, maybe the institutions of policing themselves may be salvageable? Oh. Oh no. Police are known to harass, abuse, and even [kill](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/08/1127580159/houston-tipping-lapd-death-lawsuit) the good officers in their force looking to actually protect and serve the community and citizens they signed up for? \n\nHmm\u2026 maybe All Cops Are Bastards after all. ACAB.",

The response was meant to paint the cops as these regular joes trying to take on the monster that is crime.\n\nHowever the person who made it is conservative.  Hence why supporting the murderous police over the murder.  However conservatives are dumb, and they used Frankenstein's monster to represent crime, not realizing that the monster was ALSO a victim... So ironically all he did was reveal that he in fact judges people based on appearance, like a racist would.",
