How does he transport all three across the river without leaving the wrong two on the same side for too long?\n\nThere are two answers. The first is to transport the items back and forth in such a way that the only pair on one side at a time is the fox and the cabbage, which are safe.

To briefly summarise, a woman goes to her mother's funeral, where she meets a man she hasn't met before. They really hit it off, but the woman fails to get his number. The next day she kills her sister, and the question is why?\n\nEveryone in the office come up with various vague and convoluted answers, until we ask the woman in question, and without even the scintilla of a suggestion of a pause she give the 'psychopath' answer, that the woman killed her sister in the hopes of seeing the man at the funeral.\n\nI knew she was gloomy, but this was a whole other level.",

This would leave you with 2 people and 2 apples for an easy equal share. \n\n  \nObviously there are multiple ways to solve this \"problem\". \n\nA single stroke of a knife doesn't inherently state you can't hit both apples with a single stroke. It doesn't say all pieces or the amount of pieces need to be equal. So you could stroke once at like 2/3's of the apples to create 2 1/3s and 2 2/3 for equal pieces across three people. \n\nThere are others.\n\nBut the funny part and actual goal of the riddle is to kill 1 person, because you're then thinking outside of the box.",
