    "selftext": "[TrailBase](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase) is an easy to self-host, sub-millisecond, single-executable FireBase alternative. It provides type-safe REST and realtime APIs, a built-in JS/ES6/TS runtime, SSR, auth & admin UI, ... everything you need to focus on building your next mobile, web or desktop application with fewer moving parts. Sub-millisecond latencies completely eliminate the need for dedicated caches - nor more stale or inconsistent data.\n\nJust released v0.8 with:\n\n* A cron/time-based Job system for periodic tasks with dashboard and JS/TS integration\n* OpenID Connect (OIDC) auth integration (requested by reddit user)\n* Loosened primary-key column requirements in Admin UI for tables exported via APIs.\n* ...\n\nCheck out the [live demo](http://demo.trailbase.io) or our [website](http://trailbase.io). TrailBase is only a few months young and rapidly evolving, we'd really appreciate your feedback \ud83d\ude4f",

SQLite is very capable (fully relational, SQL, ... as opposed to e.g. document DBs), well documented, it's very robust (likely mostly deployed DB in the world), extremely fast (since it got WAL mode), and embeddable (for the single-executable bit. Did also look at PGlite).",

I was pushed into the Firebase ecosystem when Google moved their analytics under the Firebase umbrella (which, now that I look, is [dating back to 2016](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-io-2016-develop-grow-earn/) whoa).\n\nI've done minimal data storage experiments with Firebase, but haven't needed auth-based storage yet. For deployment, I use Vercel via GitHub Actions rather than Firebase Hosting. I like the simplicity that Vercel/Github offer and the longer time goes on the less reliant I want to be on any Alphabet product.\n\nBy the way, I've taken a look at the Trailbase docs and I'm really impressed with the quality. The specific tutorials are excellent, and I appreciate how they compare against alternatives like PocketBase and Supabase. It's clear you're prioritizing developer experience, which is refreshing. As someone still building up my skills, well-documented tools make a huge difference in my ability to implement and use them effectively.\n\nWhat analytics features are you prioritizing in your alternative? I'd be interested in something with Firebase's simplicity but offering more granular event tracking control.",
