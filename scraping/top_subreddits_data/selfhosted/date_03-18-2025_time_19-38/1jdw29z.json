    "selftext": "LawnMate (previously LawnBuddy, still transitioning from the old name) is an app for individuals or small teams to manage their own lawn business. \n\nThis project is not yet complete, but consider it under active development. The prices on the website are not accurate and it will be open source without a fee when it's ready, with a paid SaaS version as well.\n\nThe idea is to target entrepreneurs of all ages, 13-75 by providing them with inexpensive yet helpful tools to run their own side business, whether that be a full fledge lawn operation or just a summer gig for money while school is out. \n\nIf you, or anyone you know, would like to help contribute to the project then please DM me. Feel free to critique the code and please report any bugs on the GitHub. [https://github.com/orgs/Eanix-Net/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Eanix-Net/repositories)\n\nFeedback would be much appreciated too.",

Sort of break all the business stuff down into a really simple UI.",

Could be easily used in the winter months throughout much of the world to track a snow blowing / plowing business, just as another example that uses the exact same logic. Many parts of the USA could use this same service for lawns in the summer and snow in the winter, one DB, one site, option to choose lawn cutting / window cleaning / power washing / snow blowing as check-boxes so one customer can be assigned multiple services. ServiceMate or something similar.",
