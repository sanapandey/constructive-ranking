There are small things like:\n\n* being A/V focused over group focused which improves grab propensity on more varying trackers.\n* including 1080p/SD (and soon to be 720p) fallback\n* Dealing with more focused naming issues (like this BTN atmos cf for example: [https://dictionarry.dev/formats/atmos](https://dictionarry.dev/formats/atmos) )\n\nAmong countless other tiny tweaks/optimisations. They improve the overall profile, but the foundation is still largely the same.\n\nBut, I believe profilarr solves the 'hard problem of updates':\n\n* Our configs are under constant development.\n* Users will never agree 100% to a profile they're given.\n\nSo profilarr bridges that gap and lets you make whatever changes you want (don't want dovi? get rid of it. hate xyz release group? negate them.), but still lets you get those small updates that improve the profile over time. User empowerment - that's the goal. Give the best possible foundation and then let you make whatever changes you want.\n\nMy advice to you is try both and see what works best. We're not trying to replace existing tools, we're just trying to make things easier for everyone. Only you can decide whether Profilarr does that better for you or not :)",

It's not tied to any one database.\n\n>And once I've sync'ed/pulled Dictionarry / Database do I just then connect to my Radarr|Sonarr instances?\n\nYes, in settings -> external apps\n\n>And it will overwrite/replace all my existing quality profiles?\n\nOnly if you want it to. If you enable import as unique in your app settings, it wont overwrite antyhing you already have. Otherwise, it will rename anything of the same name.\n\n  \n> And voila, that's all I need to do?\n\nYep. \n\nFeel free to ask any outstanding questions on discord, we're happy to help out: [https://discord.gg/Y9TYP6jeYZ](https://discord.gg/Y9TYP6jeYZ)",

We're always looking for more feedback :) \n\nI do remember being confused by the profilarr UI on first boot. Trying to remember in hindsight, i think it came down to the \"database\" being in settings.\n\nThat makes sense from a developer perspective, but from a user perspective the first thing i want to do is add quality profiles. (then connect sonarr, and radarr)\n\nI don't think you need to move database out of settings, but having a button on the landing page when there are no databases linked to \"Add Quality profiles\" (which will redirect to databases tab) will help with onboarding new users.\n\nNote, I think the onboarding should use the term \"quality profiles\" because that is a term new users are familiar with. I like the concept of databases that profilarr uses, but for new users it's an extra barrier to comprehension.",
