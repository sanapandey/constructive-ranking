    "selftext": "So I used to use a service on my Nvidia Shield, which was recently dropped for support. That was the nudge I needed to finally buy a SFF PC and explore the intriguing world of self hosting. My initial plan was small - just get up and running with what I lost on my Shield, then eventually expand to Plex/Arrs/game servers.\n\nAdvice here said to start with proxmox and use a linux distro VM to host my services as docker containers. Sweet, sounds fun.\n\nThe Proxmox part has gone ok. I love the fact it natively allows me to operate the PC headless and the flexibility to pivot and bail on a plan. I setup an Ubuntu VM no problem. Even managed to get an LXC running with Cockpit and 45 Drives to act as a NAS. Mounted the samba share in linux - AWESOME.\n\nMy problem is with Linux/Docker. I spent all weekend trying to get a simple container running but just hit error after error along the way. \"path does not exist\" then \"file already exists\" errors keeping the container from starting. Also, how do I get it to start on boot in the event of a power outage??\n\nI finally caved last night and installed a Windows VM. Downloaded the Windows version of my service and it just works. I'm not giving up entirely - I want to learn and understand this stuff. But I need a break and will be running with Windows for a bit while I reset. Thank you Proxmox for allowing that flexibility without losing all my work to this point in Ubuntu (though I might scrap it anyway and move to Mint).",

If you don\u2019t work in IT or tech in general it\u2019s very hard to understand VMs and containers from zero to hero.

I spent all weekend trying to get a simple container running but just hit error after error along the way. \"path does not exist\" then \"file already exists\" errors keeping the container from starting. \n\nThis is probably going to be difficult...until it isn't.  Depending on the degree of familiarity you have (and want to have) with these things there are different paths to take, whether using something with a curated ecosystem like another poster suggested or just powering through.  The internet is littered with guides and documentation of people doing these things in slightly different ways according to their opinions and biases that - when viewed from zero - can be quite confusing.\n\n  \nA lot of stuff might be documented with command-line docker, which is useful to know and be able to use, but can feel a bit overwhelming coming from nowhere and you don't really have a clean view of what you did.  I'll build images with docker, but for actually running my services it's 100% docker compose which lays out what you are running in a file that you can look at, edit, and have a clearer view of what you're doing.  There are also tools to convert docker commandlines into compose files.\n\nI run and organize my services through dockge.  It offers a convenient GUI and also suggests/enforces a sane organizational structure that avoids my personal tendency to do things slightly different from one time to the next if I don't plan carefully.\n\n  \nDon't just wildly paste compose files (although honestly that will often work) - read them, figure out what they're doing, edit them to taste, and then run them.  And learn enough linux command line to be comfortable.\n\n>Also, how do I get it to start on boot in the event of a power outage??\n\nSet up proxmox to start the VM on boot, and I always have my containers set to restart unless stopped in docker compose.",

I personally don't *like* how they do it but it's fine.\n\n  \nA few things to note:\n\n1. The /dev/dri stuff requires special handling on proxmox.  You need to pass the GPU in to the vm in addition.  **This is where proxmox is adding complexity and running bare metal would be simpler.**  This device is your video card which the software uses for hardware accelleration, and it needs direct access to it.  If you don't provide that, proxmox provides \"simulated\" hardware which does not have the same capabilities.  You also might need to set permissions.\n2. Volumes - you need to get these right, or they'll get created incorrectly as a file or folder and then give confusing behavior.  If you get exists/not-exists errors, delete and try again.\n\n>Docker Desktop\u00a0\n\nI don't mess with that.  It runs docker containers in a vm.  If you're running on proxmox already then you would now have 2 layers of abstraction between your services and the hardware - and since one of the issues you're facing is needing direct access to hardware...that's just likely to make it worse.",

My understanding is it\u2019s like Kubernetes but easy to use. \n\nPortainer is to Docker as Proxmox is to Hardware Virtualization. It helps you manage the details from above. \n\nI love these tools, I gotta give three generations of smart freaking people credit for where we are today. I started with VAX/VMS then Unix in the 70s as a little kid then Linux in the 90s and all of this today is like living the dream.",

What really help me just to understand what am i doing is CasaOS. Yes, it have problems, but it really easy just to install something from \"app store\" so it make all ports, networks, directories in right place by itself. I think without it i would probably never understand how it works. And build in file browser is pretty good. Now i still use it tbh, but yeah - managing containers here is not very good. Now i prefer Portainer for it",
