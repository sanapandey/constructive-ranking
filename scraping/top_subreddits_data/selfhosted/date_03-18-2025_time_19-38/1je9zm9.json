But if you are file browser user, I would love to have your opinion.\n\nCoded in laravel and react. Made mostly for learning purposes. Initially I didn't plan to open it, but thought it would be a good exercise in having my code scrutinized and as a portfolio piece.\n\nPlease have a look and share your thoughts. Am kind of nervous, since it is the first time I am doing something like this..\n\n  \nEdit: \n\n\\- ha someone tried to xss on the \"new folder\" , turns out I didn't have proper validation on the foldername !! . Have fixed on the main branch. will update demo later, since many are trying it atm",

I'll check it up. Thanks for sharing and good luck with this!\n\nEdit:\n\nI'd like to see this tho (cause i use filebrowser):\n\n\\- Password for a folder  \n\\- A possiblity to create a file (notepad alike)",

The header area is super cramped. It's pretty easy to miss tap on a line and pull up file settings rather than viewing it. The modals have too much padding on mobile to make it really usable(I'd rather the modal take up the whole screen with a close button, or 4/5 the screen with a gap at the top to tap to close).\n\nThose are just some thoughts from a 15 second click around \ud83d\ude05\n\nAlso, I hope this didn't come off harsh, just constructive feedback, since you say it's inspired by Google Drive, something a LOT of people use almost exclusively on mobile",
