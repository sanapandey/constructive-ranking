    "selftext": "Hi all. I'm currently using Caddy to serve my self-hosted services. I previously tried Traefik but had some trouble grasping its configuration. I'm thinking about giving it another try because of the automatic Docker service discovery and other features that sound useful, but to be honest, I think I'm a bit intimidated by it lol. For those who use Traefik or Caddy, which do you use, and why? If you use Traefik, were there any resources you found helpful when learning how to use it? Thanks.",
