    "selftext": "#Welcome to /r/selfhosted!\n\nWe thank you for taking the time to check out the subreddit here! \n\n##Self-Hosting\n\nThe concept in which you host your own applications, data, and more. Taking away the \"unknown\" factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. \n\n##Some Examples\n\nFor instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud\n\nOr let's say you're used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. \n\nThe possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. \n\n##Subreddit Wiki\n\nThere have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no *officially* hosted wiki, we do have a [github repository](https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki). There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the [reddit-based wiki](/r/selfhosted/wiki)\n\n##Since You're Here...\n\nWhile you're here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important **[rules](/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules)**\n\nWhen posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post. If an appropriate flair is not found, please let us know! If it suits the sub and doesn't fit in another category, we will get it added! **[Message the Mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fselfhosted)** to get that started.\n\nIf you're brand new to the sub, we highly recommend taking a moment to browse a couple of our awesome self-hosted and system admin tools lists.\n\n[Awesome Self-Hosted App List](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted)\n\n[Awesome Sys-Admin App List](https://github.com/n1trux/awesome-sysadmin)\n\n[Awesome Docker App List](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker)\n\nIn any case, lot's to take in, lot's to learn. Don't be disappointed if you don't catch on to any given aspect of self-hosting right away. We're available to help! \n\nAs always, happy (self)hosting!",

I already have my own domain!\"\n\nCurrently plan is to self-host(behind a VPN):\n\n* a PiHole instance\n* a RSS server\n* something to share\\access files and directories between devices\n* IMAP\\SMTP mail server(s)\n* Newsgroup server\n* IRC server\n* some ActivityPub instance(mastodon or pleroma?) meant for single-user use\n* probably a Matrix\\Element server  \n* most likely a bittorrent client\n* perhaps a emule one as well?\n* a Nextcloud instance(might or might not replace other services), \n* the VPN manager, I guess   \n* probably other stuff to see what I use\\can use\\just to play with it.\n\nSo the question:\n\nWhat would be the cheapest way to do this? I was thinking either buy a pre-made NAS, possibly with enough disk bays, or use a Raspberry Pi4 or 5, though I'm not 100% a raspberry would keep up with all this stuff which, I guess, would end up running on docker\n\nOh, yeah: suggestions on the software setup?

I\u2019m desperate for some answers.\u00a0\nI\u2019ve been in a 2 year long battle to find out what is going on in my life as far as technology goes. I\u2019m looking for someone willing to answer some questions for me that\u2019s willing to break things down into terms for a regular civilian who doesn\u2019t have much knowledge of open source software or coding and how it all works. I have specific questions that I need answered. If anyone is willing. Please just comment on my post. Due to my phone being completely bogged down on memory, I can\u2019t download the Reddit app so it won\u2019t let me personal message people on the safari browser.\u00a0\nWhen I say I\u2019ve been in a 2 year long battle I mean my life has been turned upside down and I\u2019ve been in severe depression as well as massive anxiety do to some things that have happened and ultimately it led to me attempting suicide a year and a half ago. I\u2019m no closer to answers today than I was a year and a half ago. I feel like a dog chasing her own tail endlessly.\u00a0\nThank you in advance!\u00a0",

For more privacy related questions I use Jan.ai locally on my 2016 MacBook Pro (16gb). They have plenty of LLM\u2019s to choose from plus you can use other LLM\u2019s that they don\u2019t have. Jan.ai only needs to know the location on your HD. No coding involved. Just install and ask questions. Open source and you can run it offline. It is much slower than ChatGPT of course because it only uses your computer. Good luck.",

I am looking to set up a few services, and understand I need a reverse proxy in order to give one unified front end for everything to launch from, but can this reverse proxy be the same computer I run the services from?\n\nI took a look at the github, and saw some great projects, but I am a little lost, so am wondering if anyone has any personal experiences they can offer regarding the following self-hosting projects.\n\nI am looking to run a mail server for myself. I know it is not a great idea as google and microsoft block your outgoing messages. I was wondering if there is any possibility I can still do it?\n\n  \nI also want to run a password manager. Any strong recommendations for security and self-hosting? I dont particularly care if my manager allows me to access the information from any other device, but if it does, I still want the service hosted on my device. ie, if my hosting device is turned off, the password manager stops working until the host is working again.\n\n  \nFinally, I want essentially a custom google drive. I want to store all the live data changes on one computer. But back-up to 1 or 2 other computers at set time periods. I would love if it could support a version history of files too. The most crucial aspect I want, is the ability to create multiple users who can share files with each other. As the admin, I want to be able to set size limits for the users. Most importantly, the service should handle pictures specially and allow albums. Essentially google photos self hosted with support for other files. Bonus if it can automatically backup from users phones.\n\n  \nOnce again, I am inexperienced with a lot of this stuff. I know how to read documentation. I am mainly looking for users personal experiences with similar projects so I know what I am getting myself into. The github looks amazing and I will be spending the next couple of days looking at the document management and photo galleries sections.\n\n  \nFinally, I really care about privacy, so any recommendations for keeping data secure while I all this would be appreciated.",
