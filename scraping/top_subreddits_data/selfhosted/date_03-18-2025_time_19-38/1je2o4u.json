You can either use it to deploy a Compose file [with this module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/docker/docker_compose_v2_module.html) or you can use [any of these](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/docker/index.html) in the collection to replace Docker Compose entirely with an Ansible playbook. That is personally the route I've gone since you don't have to first copy over a Docker compose file over to the host. Ansible is a rabbit hole, but a fun one. Jeff Geerling's Youtube channel & books may be your best starting point.\n\nAs far as it pertains to GitOps, you can have it call webhooks to something like [Semaphore UI](https://semaphoreui.com/) or Ansible AWX [(Simplified RPM Installer)](https://github.com/MrMEEE/awx-rpm-v2)[(Main Repo)](https://github.com/ansible/awx). I think Gitea is compatible with Github Actions, so you could install their runner and have it run a Docker container with Ansible to run your playbooks.\n\nI've been pretty deep into Ansible lately and I've been having a blast, honestly.

It's non-upgradable, unmaintained, old, libc5-based, and the only way to add a new package is to compile it yourself.  \n  \nUh, ok? lic5 is pretty old. How did they manage to achieve that?  \nThen further below:  \n  \n> For the uninitiated, Watchtower was a completely ancient set of tar files that were useful in assembling a working system. Basically, it was like a non-upgradable version of the Debian base system. Well, you could upgrade it, if manually installing tar files downloaded from phil or compiling sources from Sunsite is your idea of \"upgrading.\" It was primitive, but it was better than what came before it. Don't even ask what we had to deal with with before Watchtower!  \n  \nOh, ok...",

To my knowledge there is not a process that exists to \"replace\" an original repo with a fork. There is also risk in that if the original repo gets deleted, the fork could be affected because they inherit from the upstream: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility\n\nAll that to say, I think for a reliable solution, we need an established successor that is not just a fork of the original.\n\nAlso, there is definitely some irony in Watchtower becoming unwatched and unmaintained.",
