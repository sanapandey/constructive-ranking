    "selftext": "I have an old 2017 Acer SF113-31 that has been collecting dust for years now. I was thinking of turning it into a home server, but I'm not sure how viable that is.\n\n\n\nMy main concerns are:\n\n\\- Will it overheat and/or start a fire?\n\n\\- Will any components like the battery get damaged from running 24/7?\n\n\\- Is it even reasonable to run a home server on such a device?\n\n  \nMy plan is to host NextCloud and connect it to an external drive or something because I need more cloud storage, and maybe expand into other things in the future.\n\nI'd also probably be the only user of all the services.\n\n",

I have Nextcloud on it, and while it can be a bit slow loading files because of its age, it\u2019s still reasonably usable.\n\nAbout the battery, it could degrade over time, but since you'll be using it 24/7, you'll probably keep it plugged in most of the time anyway. It might be better to just remove the battery if possible, as constantly charging it while running could wear it out faster.\n\nHonestly, as a starting point, using that laptop sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Since I can run the apps I need and other things just fine on my old laptop, I don\u2019t see why yours , being for sure better, wouldn\u2019t work too. I think you could totally use it.",

I personally just removed the battery on the ones that I have used, as I wasn't that comfortable leaving them like that, don't think it will blow up necessarily, but didn't seem to offer any real benefit.\n\nThere was one of the ones that I tried that unfortunately wouldn't boot with larger ddr3 sodimms due to bios limitations, so keep in mind that weird issues like that could arise.",
