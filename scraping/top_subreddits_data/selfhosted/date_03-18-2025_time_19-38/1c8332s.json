    "selftext": "Good Morning, /r/selfhosted!\n\nQuick update, as I've been wanting to make this announcement since April 2nd, and just have been busy with day to day stuff. \n\n### Rules Changes\n\nFirst off, I wanted to announce some changes to the rules that will be implemented immediately. \n\nPlease reference the rules for actual changes made, but the gist is that we are no longer being as strict on what is allowed to be posted here. \n\nSpecifically, we're allowing topics that are *not* about explicitly self-hosted software, such as tools and software that *help* the self-hosted process.\n\n***Dashboard Posts Continue to be restricted to Wednesdays***\n\n### AMA Announcement  \n\n~~The CEO~~ a representative of Pomerium (u/Pomerium_CMo, with the blessing and intended participation from their CEO, /u/PeopleCallMeBob) reached out to do an AMA for a tool they're working with. The AMA is scheduled for May 29th, 2024! So stay tuned for that. We're looking forward to seeing what they have to offer. \n\nQuick and easy one today, as I do not have a lot more to add. \n\nAs always,\n\nHappy (self)hosting!",

This argumentation obviously trips on its own feets, if your truly for the whole community you gotta do better, don't make up bs arguments which you break yourself, don't remove the ability to crosspost from other subreddits as long as the posts don't break any rules",
