What problem are you trying to solve?\n\nMedia servers need very, very little power. It's just a file server serving files very slowly over a network. That i5 is several years old and would be a downgrade over a Ryzen 5 3450u. \n\nIs transcoding something you're trying to accomplish? If so; this model would have quicksync, which is handy. It would support most modern codecs and frankly, 27 bucks is about as cheap as you're going to see for something that has some reasonable transcoding capability. \n\nAs for an SSD? Yes; one can be used as a cache. Such as in ZFS you can setup an SSD as a L2 ARC. But in a media server you won't notice a difference. Even several streams happening at the same time won't come anywhere near saturating the read speed of a spinning hard drive. Unless you're transcoding a very large number of streams to a very large number of clients (which would require a \\*\\*\\*much\\*\\*\\* more powerful machine than this), there really is no advantage to an SSD in a media server. Using an SSD as the boot drive though is a really good idea; and using this spinning HDD for media storage.",
