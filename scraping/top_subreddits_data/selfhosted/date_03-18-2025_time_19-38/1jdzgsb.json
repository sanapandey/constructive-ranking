I know Dynamic DNS is a thing, but I don\u2019t want to rely on services that log and track me. Are there any self hosted, privacy friendly alternatives out there? Would love to hear what the privacy conscious crowd is using.",

DNS, by definition, is public.\n\nUse a VPN, like tailscale. Or a tunnel like Cloudflare Tunnel.",

OP asked for a non-cloud solution. What would you suggest he can do that is not cloud based? He needs to update his DNS, but can\u2019t use a public cloud DNS provider like Cloudflare or AWS. Using his registrar as NS is also cloud based, so the only option is to get static IPv4 and run his own NS. I see no other way. Maybe you have a better idea?",

That\u2019s standard NAT traversal, as you said. However, once the WireGuard tunnel is established (through an initial outbound handshake, your server maintains this open NAT state using periodic keep-alive packets), your home server gains a public entry point through the VPS. You can now receive inbound traffic from the outside world, directed through yo ur VPS, to your home server\u2014exactly the scenario CGNAT normally prevents.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019re not removing CGNAT, but you are bypassing the core restriction: the inability to accept inbound connections directly. Using WireGuard with a VPS achieves the same result as *overlay networks* (like Tailscale or ZeroTier). Overlay networks simplify the process by automating simultaneous ***outbound*** connections (\u201chole punching\u201d), while WireGuard with a VPS creates a stable, manually configured relay point.\n\nTailscale uses the same method. Tailscale is WireGuard plus an automated overlay network and additional infrastructure to make setup easy and NAT traversal reliable. \n\n\n\n> that is not what is referred to as \"bypassing\" CGNAT.\n\nWell\u2026 seems like you are not in charge to decide that:\n\nhttps://github.com/mochman/Bypass_CGNAT\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/10vx69b/ultimate_noob_guide_how_to_bypass_cgnat_using/\n\nhttps://forum.gl-inet.com/t/bypassing-cgnat-with-wireguard-possible-configurations/48278\n\nhttps://mikenet.uk/homelab/wireguard/networking/2022/05/03/routing-a-public-ip-over-wireguard-to-overcome-cgnat.html\n\nhttps://github.com/BurleighTech1/Bypass-CGNat\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/u8n5hz/how_to_bypass_cgnat_and_expose_your_server_to_the/\n\nhttps://usercomp.com/news/1420175/wireguard-wizardry\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/ungeskriptet/3a981b1d1087f15858431399d8e75f5a\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WireGuard/comments/wtvn5m/need_advice_on_how_to_bypass_cgnat_at_l3_with/\n\nhttps://jramtech.gitlab.io/post/getting-over-cgnat-wireguard-gce/\n\nr/confidatiallyincorrect",

CGNAT doesn't prevent traffic from coming in, it just makes establishing connections hard. You can hole punch CGNAT and receive traffic just fine. Just because NAT is pretty much universally done at the firewall doesn't make CGNAT a firewall; it's a routing issue, not a traffic blocking issue.\n\nYou're still not accepting external connections directly to your machine, and are as you've noted relaying through the VPS.\n\n> Using WireGuard with a VPS achieves the same result as overlay networks (like Tailscale or ZeroTier).\n\nDepending on your goal, yes, it can achieve the same end result.\n\n> Tailscale uses the same method.\n\nThis isn't correct. Tailscale might achieve the same result but it does NOT use the same method at all. One example of where the difference matters is if your clients are close but your relay VPS is further away; using the relay sees traffic travelling away from your destination and then back, increasing the latency. With an overlay network hole-punching through double-ended CGNAT, the traffic can go directly from client to client.\n\nThe difference is not pedantry; it matters.\n\nWith vanilla Wireguard, what you're doing is just relying on a regular server-client architecture with very straightforward, conventional networking that doesn't even need to evade or contravene double-NAT limitations. With an overlay network or similar NAT hole-punching technologies, you're allowing direct client-to-client connections in spite of those limitations.\n\n> r/confidatiallyincorrect\n\nOh, jeez...",

You could use a completely self hosted overlay network like Headscale, Netbird or Nebula, but those need a public address that's reliably routable so you'd need a VPS provider you trust. Mind you, in all of those cases the data you leak to the service provider is by design pretty minimal, the only real exception is Cloudflare Tunnels since they at least in theory can inspect all traffic running through the tunnel.

Using a VPN is also still partially dependent on a third party, as your VPN client has to know the IP for the VPN server. In most cases this is just going to be DDNS, or otherwise some other protocol where a third party service is involved.\n\nThere is no escaping the theoretical link back to you. But realistically speaking, data tracking is more likely from a company offering a service that tunnels all of your traffic through it, rather than a simple DDNS record with WHOIS privacy that occasionally updates with your public IP.\n\n*Plus, both your ISP and mobile data provider are already selling your traffic to advertisers and using geofencing to push regional ads. At that point, what's wrong with having some domain like \"j3ffb3z0s.xyz\" pointing to your public IP?*",

You could even use asymmetric cryptography (public-private key pair encryption) to protect the embedded info so you know it\u2019s from you. Posted images should only be used only one time and will either need to be distributed ahead of time (one time pad like) or you\u2019ll have to have a standard location within the image for embedding the encrypted IP.\n\nGood luck.",
