I was wondering if mobile devices (phones, tablets laptops) would be able to drive a pair of beyerdynamic dt 770 pro x (48 ohms) as I heard that going above 32 ohms genrally isnt a good idea with mobile devices. I was also wondering at which point id need a dac. would i be able to use 80, 250, 300 ohms without issue on a laptop?",

I\u2019m pretty darn ignorant of the audiophile life, but I wanted to just jump in head first to avoid spending more down the line\u2026 so I purchased Meze 109 pros, a Zen Dac V3 for my desktop and a qudelix for my phone. \n\nJoking about the hearing, so far I am thoroughly enjoying the quality as is and greatly appreciate the fidelity.\n\nSo my question is, what do I need to do to get the most out of these setups? I don\u2019t know much about dialing eqs, and I currently just have YouTube music, which is 256kbps on high. \n\nAm I throttled by that bitrate? And am I missing things by just plugging and playing without dialing eqs? \n\n(Right now I\u2019m mostly listening to more relaxed edm and lofi stuff but I generally listen to a wide array, with a focus on classic rock. Not into super heavy bass. Also open to music suggestions to get my socks knocked off.)",

From what I've seen, most people (myself include) can't really distinguish any difference in quality from that high of a bitrate vs like 320kbps or lossless. \n\nMessing around with EQ is basically the same as adjusting a recipe to your tastes while cooking. If you're satisfied with the recipe as is, there's no need to EQ. Sometimes, there's an issue that people want to correct (like parts of the treble being too sharp or something) or they want to punch it up to their preference (like adding more bass).",

The 6.3mm adapter you're (assumably) using to connect to the Magni could be of the kind that doesn't work properly with TRRS plugs. To confirm, hold down the play/pause button while playing something. If the sound gets back to normal while doing that, then that's it - you simply need a TRRS compatible adapter. In my experience quite many adapters are that even while not being explicitly advertised as such; you could buy a few cheap ones and pretty likely at least one will play nice with TRRS. Or you could get a guaranteed one, like the one [MEE Audio](https://meeaudio.com/products/adptr-14in-mee) sells.",

For about as long as I have had these, I seem to have an audio leak issue. Any music or sound I am listening to gets pick up by my microphone very clearly even at quiet levels. Like unnaturally clear. This is especially a problem in discord as it can cause my mic to constantly be active and playing the game sounds to everyone.\n\nHere is a recording of me playing music at a comfortable level. If I take the headphones off, I can hear the music quieter and less clear than even on the recording. I'm thinking there might be a wiring issue that is causing the headphone audio to cross directly over into the mic audio. Even if I press my hand completely over the microphone, there is no change in volume or clarity to the music.\n\nI have had these headphones for a very long time and struggle to find ones I like more. I would love to find a way to fix this issue. I just don't know if the issue is with the microphone wire, or a problem in the headphones themselves.

Today I have lost audio in the left ear. I've done everything I can think of to repair the audio and after 2 years of near constant use I don't think these headphones owe me anything. So, I'm looking for recommendations:\n\nI primarily use my headphones at work so I'd like them to have a mic so that I can take calls - I'm using a pair of Sony ZX310 On-Ear Headphones as an emergency back up though stupidly bought a version without a mic. I travel a lot so being able to connect to in-flight entertainment is a must for me, though I am open to wireless options. I'm not a huge audiophile and mostly use my headphones for podcasts and audiobooks; I use a pair of Skull Candy Dime for music at the gym so that should give you a sense of the audio quality I'm used to!\n\nI don't want to spend too much because I'm at a pretty high risk of loosing things. Still, I'm open to spending a little more than I have done before because I wear headphones for so much of the day. It's my birthday soon and the Easter sales are coming up too so I'm hoping some bargains can be found.\n\nAny advice gratefully received!",

Comfort (i will use them for long hours, i dont mind battery life I\u2019m happy to use them wired from time to time)\n2. Sound Quality \n3. ANC \n4. the rest doesn't matter to me. These are my only preference when it comes to choosing headphones. \n\nThe bose still has good leather earpads and no scratches on the body. But the peace of mind from buying a brand new JBL is what makes it hard to choose.",

I now have seven pairs of these headphones, and of the seven pairs, only two are loud. The others are also loud, but not like the others; they are very loud. So, it can't be because of dirty headphones or something, or dust in the headphones or speakers. They're all clean and as good as new.  \nPls Help ,anybody knows this ?BEATS Solo3 \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb",

It always hummed with sensitive IEMs, but never with the 6XX.\n\nEdit: I think the humming is now gone again so I have no idea what that was about.",

So i need to reduce the software volume (through android) to the lowest setting. This causes wierd artefacts to crop up during the quieter portions of the songs (I assume due to bit crushing or something)\n\nThe solution that i found to this problem is to use Usb Audio player pro to reduce the hardware volume of the DAC so that the software volume can remain higher. This resolved the bitcrushing and crackling issue.\n\nI listen to music on spotify, and I dont use UAPP to play any music, I just use it to reduce the hardware volume (-23 dB) and then I close it. But the mic doesn't work when i do this, i have to disconnect my earphones and use the phone mic to answer calls etc. when UAPP is disabled and i plug in my earphones, the mic works but the hardware volume goes back to the default loud setting.\n\nIs there any way that i can achieve a similar effect without messing up my mic?\n\nup:\n\nNothing phone 2\n\nAudiocular d07 slim\n\nRealme wired buds 2",
