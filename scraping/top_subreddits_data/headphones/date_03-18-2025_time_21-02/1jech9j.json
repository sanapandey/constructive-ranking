    "selftext": "I have mainly been using my Salnotes Zeros and Hifiman Anandas for daily listening but picked up a pair of Focal Listen Pros and when  I first put them on I thought they were broken, that's how much of a difference a flat studio monitor sound makes, at least to me. Now I've been down this road before so I used them exclusively for a couple of weeks and I would no longer call them dark but recessed in the highs, the bass seems tighter and more focused and the mids are still a bit recessed but crystal clean. I used my Zeros for the first time last night the first thing my brain thought was \"too bright!!\" Lol. Just goes to show you how involved the mental break in is when getting a new set of headphones/IEMs with a totally different sound signature. ",

It's a mix between 'breaks easily but is cheap to replace/repair' and 'built well but expensive' so that's not really it either. A lot of them have thin pads so comfort is exactly a highlight either on a lot of them.\n\nAll it really means in the end is that it's a headphone aimed towards professional use for whatever makes it suitable for that purpose according to the manufacturer. It's a complete crap shoot.",

It's fast now, and I can just switch between them.\n\nI wonder if others have had this experience.\n\nI'm sure studio engineers and producers that had to regularly work in different studios had a similar experience.

Can't hear any bass from my Hifiman HE-1000 afterwards for 4 depressing weeks before I was convinced that I got my low bass hearing back. I won't use the XM4 for more than 15min at a time now. Only kept it as a reference for what a bass boost headphones sounds like.",
