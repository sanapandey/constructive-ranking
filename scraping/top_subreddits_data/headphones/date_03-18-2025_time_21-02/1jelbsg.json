            "body": "Welp fellas, can I get some Fs in this chat?\n\n \nInstead of making fat paragraphs, I'll summarize in bullet points to keep things more concise. tl;dr Woo WEE energizer transformer box tore a hole in my SR-X9000 left driver.\n\n* I've owned my pair of SR-X9000 since June 2022\n\n\n* Primarily used them with my SRM-353X energizer, until I got a Woo Audio WEE (Woo Electrostatic Energizer) back in 2023 to better drive them with my restored Yamaha M-80 amp\n\n\n* Have worked great on that setup, until about a week ago\n\n\n* Was listening to music, when I needed to check something out momentarily on my hifi setup, so I took them off and had them resting on my bed\n\n\n* While inspecting, I heard a sudden snapping/popping sound, like the sound of a \u201cParty Snaps\u201d popper\n\n\n* I thought maybe something fell from one of my shelves, like a pen\n\n\n* My cat who was next to me, upon hearing the sound, kept staring towards my bed in the direction of the X9000s\n\n\n* Eventually when I put them back on to listen, I heard a warbling squeal coming from the left driver, while also having a channel imbalance where the left was now about 20ish percent quieter than the right\n\n\n* Not sure what caused the squeal and imbalance, I inspected the dust covers and removed any hairs stuck on them\n\n\n* Squealing and imbalance continued\n\n\n* Thinking it may have been a parasitic charge, I set them in their storage box for several days to let the charge dissipate (shorting the cable pins at the time did not help)\n\n\n* Also came across a thread on Head-Case that documented Woo Audio devices like the GES and WEE having the capability of destroying drivers due to improper ballast resistors for the bias supply used (or lacking them entirely), leading to slow destruction of the anti-static coating, causing driver membranes to stick to the stators and arc and burn\n\n\n* Worried that my Woo WEE might have been a culprit, I opened it up to try and get images of the resistors so that knowledgeable members like Spritzer would be able to confirm whether my unit was safe or bad, but the internal cases have lids that are sealed with adhesive that I could not open, so I could not get images\n\n\n* Tested them out yesterday using my SRD-6 SB (yes it's normal bias but it's still safe on pro bias sets)\n\n\n* Channel imbalance was gone! But the squealing was still there\u2026. And after 30ish minutes I noticed the imbalance slowly starting to return\n\n\n* Figuring at this point that there might be dust on the actual driver membrane causing the arcing squeal, I opened the driver up in a dust-free area\n\n\n* Driver was completely spotless! But then I noticed the hole\u2026. And on part of the hole was a little tab, with signs of burning from arcing\n\n\n* With no dust on the driver membrane whatsoever, that only leaves one culprit, the WEE\n\n\n* Surprisingly, after snipping that tab, and carefully reassembling the driver, plugging them into my SRM-353X, the imbalance is now gone (since nothing is now touching the stators) and\u2026 They play as if the hole wasn't even there, I'm not kidding, the sound is still perfect\n\n\n* I can live with this until I'm able to source a replacement driver (my pair is long gone out of warranty so any repairs are out of pocket)\n\n\n* Definitely ditching the WEE and going to get a different pro-bias transformer energizer box. PSA: Avoid Woo Audio electrostatic equipment\n\n\n* Good thing I didn't have them on my head when the snapping pop occured\u2026",
