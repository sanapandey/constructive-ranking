Harman didn't just throw the pinna gain in a random spot, the place of the rise and amount is based on DF. It's why you won't see a real difference in where the pinna gain starts and the amount of gain between JM-1 and Harman. You'll see some differences right after the peak but the shape and peak itself matches well. \n\nIt won't be perfect for everyone's ears but that was never the goal of Harman. For most people a more filled in upper midrange will sound more natural because it more closely aligns with their own HRTF DF. A lot of people enjoy the effects that the HiFiMAN dip has but it does come with a penalty to midrange timbre. For some it will be smaller or bigger than for others. A lot of people remove the dip with EQ either completely or partially. I'm personally still experimenting with this on my HD800S and HE6se v2. I do notice that a more filled in upper midrange does sound more natural but I do also enjoy the spaciousness effect of having a dip, but my ears aren't that picky so I don't really have a strong preference for either and can enjoy both for what they are.",

I\u2019ve had both the r70x\u2019s and now the r70xa, and one of the big thing I notice on the new pair is a lot more sub bass. Don\u2019t get me wrong the r70x\u2019s had no issues with bass, but they sort of had a quiet sub bass in comparison. It\u2019s not overblown on the new ones, and the mid range and treble seem clearer on the new set. I\u2019m still getting used to them though. So far these have the most sub bass I\u2019ve ever heard on open back headphones",

Why do you think they say they need a break after listening to high end headphones. It's because you guys think the correct sound is only one specific thing, but in reality audiophile headphones can be a huge range of products and sounds.",

Mostly they sound bassier because they're darker, so there's more bass & low mids relative to the upper mids.\n\nI've seen ZMF recommended a lot as an actual HD600 with bass extension. I haven't heard any ZMFs myself and IDK which specific ones(s) have that sound. They get a bit complicated with all the different pad options etc.",

It has actual sub bass unlike the Senns, but the flat response means that without EQ it has pretty much zero kick.
