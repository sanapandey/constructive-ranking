    "selftext": "First post!\n\nI just had to share this.\n\nHi all,\n\nMy name is Dani\u00ebl, 41 years old. Father of two and happily married. Pleased to meet you! I'm from the Netherlands btw (stroopwafels!!!)\n\nI've been lurking for a long time on these subreddits. Gaining info, reading reviews watching tests, listening to sound demos (YouTube ) etc... I've Been trying out some audio equipment here and there the last couple of years. I am by no means a audiophile but i do enjoy good sound. (Music to my ears)\n\nLast few weeks have been Kossception for  me (KSC75 on PP band with the Yaxi pads and PP's on KSC75 earclips stock pads) But now I'm back to listening to my #1 IEM again the Raptgo Hook X HBB and I can really appreciate the unique sound again of this planar banger. The crisp details the punchiness of the bass. Oh man I'm HOOKED (again) It's like listening through them for the first time all over! I think that's a huge tip to sometimes just leave your favorite IEM or HP for a while. Btw i use these with the Final E eartips, connected via balanced 2.5mm (maybe not totally necessary) cable to a Qudelix 5K which is plugged in to my phone.(This I call my little magic box) enough has been said about that box. \n\nBig credits though for KOSS. I would say HIFI on a budget. Especially the PP's on Ear clips was a positive surprise. Makes me wonder if i should sell my HD600's ;) and maybe go for planar HP's. You guy's have a recommendation around same price range of the 600's +/- 100 euros/dollars? \n\nI also have the Simgot EA500's IEMs. These are also crazy good for the price. I mostly use those as beaters though and for portable gaming (switch). Still they have a really pleasant sound. Wouldn't mind if those were the only IEM i have in my possession.\n\nI listen to all sorts of genres of music.\nPop, rock, edm, hiphop, jazz, classic.\n\nWhat do you guy's think is the \"best\" planar IEM that does not break the bank. But is an easy listening?\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEnjoy the music!",

I too pair it with my QD5k, it's awesome. Great for gaming and great for music, I do recommend EQ them to Oratorys target tho.",
