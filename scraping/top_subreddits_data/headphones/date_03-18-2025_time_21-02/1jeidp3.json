And I'm still worried about the availability of this headband cushion as a spare part.\n\nOn the HD 6*0, 560s and HD 800s headband cushion replacement is relatively easy and available\n\nAnd maybe someday release their measurements on their own website? Like Moondrop labs. It's hard to compare models on their line",
