Check the used market. The 7506 is perhaps the easiest to find used in good condition, and they are everywhere. Most of mine in that style are used and you can save a lot buying it with horrible pads if you are thinking of changing them.  Another thing I look for are bad coiled cables because I change them for shorter better quality ones and people are willing to lower the price a lot for a great unit with bad pads and ugly cables. But for this you have to be willing to do a little soldering. Headband on the other hand should be in great condition and not flaked. Once that goes, you are better off getting a newer unit. The 7506, V6 and CD900ST chassis is pretty indestructible.",
