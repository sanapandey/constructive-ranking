    "selftext": "Hi you guys, \n\nI know not a lot of people have Munitio headphones, but I was wondering if anyone has gotten ahold of their customer service before? \n\nMy ear cups are both peeled (I rarely use them, but do like them), so I wanted to ask if they sell replacements since right now the leather flakes get everywhere. \n\nContacted them a week or more ago and have not heard back. Also tried social media, no response. \n\nAlso, what do you think of Munitio headphones (any/general quality)?\n\nThanks!",
