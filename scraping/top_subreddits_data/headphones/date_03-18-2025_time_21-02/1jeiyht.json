    "selftext": "Got the HIFIMAN stand out of the box, since my Arya are already on a new stand I bought, so I will use this for my HD 540 Reference II, and probably for my future HD 600 or Audeze LCD-2C.\n\nWill this tear up my pads? Or is it safe enough to keep them there? Will it impact differently to my HD 540 Reference II / Arya Stealth / future HD 600 / future LCD-2C? \n\nThe headband of the Arya lean a little bit more to one side since the stand form, and by hanging them from the leatjer strap I suppose they will deform faster, any tips?\n\nThanks!",
