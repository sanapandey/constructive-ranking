    "selftext": "For the sake of your own wallets, please avoid Hifiman like the plague. These things are pieces of hot garbage.\n\nTo be clear, I think these things sound amazing. I took the leap and bought Hifiman Ananda Nanos last year and haven't been the least bit disappointed in terms of sound quality. They were exactly what I was looking for (save a bit of sound isolation since I live in the city with my partner, but you cant win them all).\n\nThe build quality and durability is hot garbage. I should've really turned back when it took me 2 returns to get a unit that didn't have headphone jack problems on the earcups. This is the second time I've had to get them repaired. And some of the design decisions don't make sense. The leather headband is held on with plastic and cracked only a couple months into owning it. I don't think I'm being particularly rough with it either, I've owned plenty of headphones, cheap and expensive, and I've owned headphones with connections on each ear, and I've never had such problems with durability.\n\nI wish I could've gone back and gotten any thing else.",

And like you, I'm rough on my stuff (though they all typically remain at my listening station) and I've dropped most of them. Never had a single issue. Oh, I should mention that I bought most of them open box or refurbished. I don't doubt anyone's experience with Hifiman, I just wonder how I've gotten so incredibly lucky with my headphones experience. Recently, I picked up a Fiio FT1 Pro for $170 new on eBay. It's supposed to have a QC issue with the screw that attaches the yoke to the headband. It's supposed to cause the headband to detach from the cups easily after moderate use. I've been using the heck out of them for the past month and they've been great and seem rather sturdy. They seem like a crazy value to me. I must just be lucky in terms of the models I receive.",

Both have the ZMF house sound, which is much warmer than the Susvara and, generally, extremely 'fun' to listen to. I like EDM, electronic, and upbeat music with a fair amount of bass, and both do an excellent job at that. The Atrium is very 'speaker-like', which makes me long for a nice cup of coffee or bourbon in my lounge chair (depending on the time of day). The Caldera has a quicker attack and decay and works fantastic with EDM and other fast-paced music.\n\nThe Susvara is much more detailed and crisp, with amazing midrange and treble. Sibilance is mindblowing, and the attack and decay are probably the best I've heard (not much reference, though; I never listened to a proper electrostatic HP). Especially with guitar and piano music, as well as any classical music, the difference with the ZMFs is significant. Is it worth the full price? That's debatable. I bought it as an open box with a good discount, making it worth it for me. \n\nMy biggest issue is that now I want to hear other TOTL headphones, like the Abyss 1266 Phi TC and the RAAL 1995 Immanis, which I really can't afford :)",

I'd say that the Stealth sounds ever so slightly cleaner, like the planar driver is never stressed. The 8XX/800S, with their dynamic driver doesn't seem quite as well composed during more dynamic music, but the 8XX has better dynamics overall. In terms of soundstage, they both excel, however, the 8XX has the biggest and best soundstage I've ever heard. Truly fantastic. Syballance is a non-issue for me on either set, but I'm not very treble sensitive. I'd say it's more of an issue on the 8XX. Imaging is great on both sets. I find that the Arya Stealth is a little better for marathon listening sessions (4+ hours) as the Stealth is incredibly non-fatiguing. I love both of them, but I definitely reach for the 8XX more often. I love soundstage and the 8XX has just the soundstage for me.",

When I look at the workmanship of the transducers, at how the paths are sputtered onto the membrane without any lamination, at the workmanship itself, which looks more like a DIY project than something made by a leading manufacturer of planar headphones. Even the structure of the paths in old orthodynamic Yamahas or in T50RP looks better than what HFM does. Let's ignore the huge membrane that tends to fall into resonance, because to this day they probably cannot evenly stretch the membrane in a repeatable way, only it looks more like a lottery, spaces on the membrane that do not have paths, due to which the membrane in such places is uncontrollable or sputtering with silver/gold in Susvars, due to which the membrane becomes heavy and due to which a huge amount of power is needed to be able to drive them, which explains the low sensitivity and high resistance in the case of gold-coated membranes in Susvars.\u00a0 If I were to play with headphones that sound great but are also relatively prone to failures, I would rather play with STAXes, even if the Energizers are terribly expensive, the headphones sometimes tend to lose balance between channels, or only have a one-year warranty on their products, which if they break down, have to be sent to Japan, if they want to repair them. I could also criticize Abyss, but I'll let it go for now.",
