    "selftext": "**Unboxing:** The product box is quite neutral and includes some specifications like impedance and sensitivity. It\u2019s very minimalist, though I wish the back of the box had included a THD graph and a frequency response graph for the IEM. Unfortunately, these were not added. The font used on the box is awful, and the gold accents slightly hinder text readability.\n\n**Design:** The IEM itself looks beautiful, but the copper-colored details paired with a hideous font create a middling aesthetic\u2014somewhere between decorative and minimalist. However, it fails to excel at either, making the design feel more generic than it would if it were simply all black.\n\n**Modular Cable:** The modular cable might appeal to some users, but it adds an unappealing extra cost for those who prefer a simple connector or already own a balanced adapter. That said, the cable itself is good, and the ear tips are comfortable.\n\n**Comfort:** Uncomfortable for those with small ears (like me), though not terrible. The nozzle size should be smaller to accommodate varying ear canal sizes\u2014a common flaw in products made by or in collaboration with Crin, as well as Chinese IEMs in general (Chinese manufacturers need to remember that ears come in different shapes and sizes worldwide).\n\n**Sound:**\n\n**- Sub-bass:** Slightly elevated beyond my preference, leading to overpowering impact in some tracks, nearing intolerable levels.\n\n**- Mid-bass:** Also a touch too pronounced, causing electric bass guitar to dominate in densely instrumented songs. This blurs separation unless the mix explicitly optimizes for it.\n\n**- Mids:** Recessed compared to my ideal, veiling details in instruments like guitars and making vocals overly subdued.\n\n**- Upper mids:** Excessively soft, stripping away the natural intensity and detail of instruments. The \u201cMeta\u201d tuning likely aims to mitigate ear canal resonance (common around 5kHz\u201311kHz), but flattening the entire region sacrifices too much clarity. A sine sweep reveals this resonance, which is best addressed via EQ rather than broad suppression. My ear canal resonance is centered at\u00a05kHz.\n\n**- Treble (10kHz+):** Decent but slightly too intense for my taste; a \u22125dB cut would make it more natural.\n\n**Conclusion:** The CrinEar Meta might please those with larger ears or who align with the Meta tuning. For me, with smaller ears, it feels overemphasized in some areas and too subdued in others, resulting in a disjointed experience. That said, while the Meta tuning may appeal to many users, the Harman target still holds up slightly better for my ears in the midrange overall\u2014except for the region above 10kHz, which could be a touch more elevated in the Harman target. However, as noted earlier, this treble range varies significantly between listeners.",
