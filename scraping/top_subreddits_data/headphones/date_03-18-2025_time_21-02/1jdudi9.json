    "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nThe Drop + Grell OAE1 is an open-back headphone designed by Axel Grell, famed for his work on products like the Sennheiser HD600 and HD800 series. As a result, there was a lot of chatter and expectations about these headphones and what they would sound like. I've had enough time with them to form some solid thoughts, so I'd like to share those with you guys today. As usual, I'll talk about the build, the sound, and some comparisons to other headphones.\n\nFor full transparency, I was provided a review unit by Drop in exchange for my honest thoughts. I will note that at least with my experience, Drop was very proactive in trying to maintain the integrity of the review, being very clear that they had no requests regarding the content aside from posting the review on the Drop platform as well. So kudos to them regarding that.\n\nFor reference, this model was priced at 299USD but has since gone as low as 199 USD, putting it squarely against competitors like the Hifiman Edition XS and the Sennheiser HD6XX.\n\nNow onto the review!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Build and Accessories**\n\nThe OAE1 comes in what I'd consider pretty standard Massdrop packaging. It's just a cardboard box with the barebones inside. Headphones, cable, connection adapter, and an instruction manual.\n\nThe yokes and mesh are made of metal and have a nice solid feel to them. They don't feel flimsy at all and there\u2019s a sense of refinement with how everything\u2019s put together. Measuring 375g on my scale, they don't feel very heavy on the head and I wouldn't mind wearing them for hours (if it wasn't for other issues detailed below).\n\nThe cups can fold to lie flat (though can't do a full 180), which gives them a good amount of swivel to fit different heads. The adjustment mechanism feels pretty smooth, though I wish there were tactile steps or marks. The velour on the earpads are a bit scratchy and feel similar to cheaper aftermarket pads. But the foam is not overly squishy or stiff and the ear holes are decently sized.\n\nThe earpads use proprietary clips to mount onto the cups and it\u2019s hard to even tell that they\u2019re removable at first because of how flush they are. It\u2019s not as cumbersome to attach as Hifiman\u2019s mounting mechanism, but is still kind of a pain to work with. I'd also be very careful about trying to pry the earpads by pulling from the inside, the fabric of the earpad tears very easily from the bottom.\n\nThe headband is just okay. The padding is minimal and I do worry about the longevity of the pleather. It just feels like the kind of pleather that's bound to flake off over time (though supposedly all parts on this headphone are replaceable).\n\nThe cable is single-ended, wrapped in fabric, and feels decent. I actually like this cable since it\u2019s pliable enough that it\u2019s easy to untangle despite having a bit of memory to it. I like that you can connect it to either earcup, so you can have the cable on the left or the right. It\u2019s a little weird at first because the cable fits in \"seamlessly\" to the connector, so you have to push it in more than you expect. But like the earpads, it means everything's flush and clean once you have it connected.\n\nComfort-wise, this is where things fall apart for me. The first issue is that the headband adjustment does not extend much. I have a larger head but I haven't come across something that didn't fit until the Grell OAE1. Even with the headband fully maxed out, it feels like I'm one notch below my preference.\n\nThe second issue is that the clamp force feels incredibly high. I do like a firm clamp, especially with smoother earpads, because it keeps the headphones from slipping around. But these feel like they clamp harder than the HD600 series. I assume the tight fit on my head is part of the reason it feels particularly intense.\n\nSo for me, what ends up happening is basically a triangle of death where the sides and top of my head are all being crushed at once. I think it would be bearable for me if the headband could at least adjust a bit more, but in its current state, I get actual headaches from using the OAE1 for more than 30 minutes.\n\nPower-wise, while these are only 38 ohms, I found they actually need a little more power than the HD6XX to drive. They\u2019re similar to the AKG K700 series in that regard, which also needs more power than you would expect. While it can run off a dongle, I\u2019d recommend using a dedicated headphone amp for best results.\n\nOverall, I like the *design and build* of the Drop + Grell OAE1. It feels refined and deliberate with reasonable compromises in materials. But the comfort for me is a dealbreaker. I think this headphone could be fairly comfortable for smaller heads, but for people like me, it is just painful to use the OAE1 for any extended period.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sound Impressions**\n\nSo initially, I felt like the general sound of the OAE1 was like a dark version of Grado. It's bassy, very forward in the upper midrange, and seems to focus more on being lively than accurate. Having listened to it more, I still think the OAE1 has some Grado-like qualities, but it\u2019s definitely its own beast. I'll be honest, even after spending almost a month with the OAE1, I'm still unsure how I feel about the sound.\n\nLet's start with the OAE1's strengths. The main thing that people will notice is the bass. While I wouldn't say the resolution and texture punches above its price point, this is bass that I haven't heard from an open-back before. It is incredibly boosted, we're talking consumer-audio levels of bass here. It bleeds into the lower mids so it does make things a bit muddy. But to my ears, it also extends quite low into the subbass, so the bass response has a lot of weight and rumble behind it. The OAE1 is probably the closest you'll get to a bass shelf from an open-back aside from an EQ'd planar.\n\nThe other thing is the very forward upper midrange. Overall, this helps with retaining clarity as vocals and instruments still cut through despite the copious amounts of bass. Vocals can sound very up close, as if they're right on my head. The positioning of the headphones affects this and I find it's a bit too close and intense wearing normally. So I prefer to have the cups pushed more forward so that the drivers are further away.\n\nTogether, these qualities in the OAE1 make it easy to just get into the rhythm of the music and vibe with the beat. However, when I listen more carefully, there are some issues that drag the OAE1 down for me.\n\nThe biggest issue is what sounds like a huge treble dip somewhere in the 6-8khz region. Combined with the big bass boost, what this ends up doing is making the OAE1 sound very thick and heavy. The music sounds closed-in and claustrophobic, lacking room to breathe and spread out. While you can hear the main \"body\" of the sound clearly, the nuances are blunted and rounded off. It doesn\u2019t feel like you get the full range of the sound. In addition, while the boosted upper midrange does help with retaining clarity, the treble dip works against it. So rather than sounding full and clear, the OAE1 can sound both shouty and strained.\n\nThis also means that the OAE1 doesn't sound particularly detailed. It\u2019s almost like a photograph that's had the contrast boosted too much. It looks nice at a glance, but the texture and finer details are lost. I found this improves by removing the felt dampening material on the driver. This makes the sound less claustrophobic and removes some of the bass bloat. However, the downside is that the treble becomes quite bright and sharp. And more importantly, that dip seems to contribute to the OAE1's other unique trait.\n\nWhich is the soundstage presentation. Now, I think Drop's blurb about an \"ultra-expansive\" soundstage is somewhat misleading. For me, the soundstage on the OAE1 is pretty small, similar to the HD6XX. This means it suffers from the same issue as the HD6XX, which is that the separation isn't very good when things get busy and the music easily becomes a wall of sound.\n\nThat said, I find the imaging to be better on the OAE1. It feels more precise with horizontal imaging in particular and that means it can actually sound wider than the HD6XX, depending on the mix. It's also decent for gaming because of this (though I prefer it for cinematic gaming since the bass can be a bit too much for things like shooters).\n\nBut what's unique about the sound presentation is that the music actually seems to be projected forward. Usually for me, I hear soundstage like the front of my head is where the mic is and everything is playing more towards the back. But on the OAE1, I actually hear everything pushed up to the front of my head. While it's not enough to give me the illusion of speakers or anything, it is an interesting effect that I haven't gotten from any other headphones to this degree.\n\nAs I mentioned before, you can kind of fix some of the issues with the OAE1's stock tuning by doing some mods or using EQ. However, I found that whenever I did, this always made the OAE1 sound more like a \"regular\" headphone. The bass response remains surprisingly hefty, but you lose some of the subbass quantity. And while the soundstage still projects forwards, the effect is not quite as strong and the OAE1 just ends up sounding like a super shouty headphone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nSo this time, I'll be doing comparisons a bit differently. I noticed that no matter what headphone I compared to, I pretty much had the same impression of the OAE1's strengths and weaknesses. So I'll be comparing multiple at once with the OAE1 and hopefully that'll give a better idea of what kind of headphone it is.\n\nNow the OAE1's bass is really what I think will appeal to people more than the soundstage presentation. As I mentioned before, it's quite boosted and bleeds into the lower mids, giving you thicker and heavier bass than even something like the Sony WH-1000XM4. But if you EQ it down, it is decently textured and you still have shockingly good extension down to the subbass. To my ears, it definitely beats the Sennheiser HD6XX and it extends lower than even the Aune AR5000, which I thought had pretty good extension for an open-back. IMO, it's comparable to the kind of extension you get from Hifiman planars.\n\nThe other thing is that the bass has a respectable amount of slam and impact even after EQing it down. I haven't heard any other open-back in this price range with the OAE1's level of slam. The Edition XS and the HD6XX sound limp in comparison. I also find it slams harder than the Aune AR5000 or the Beyerdynamic DT880. It's not quite at the level of slam that the Fostex biodynamics have, but it's not far off from something like the Hifiman HE6se V2.\n\nIn terms of the treble, the OAE1 is not as bright as Hifiman or a Beyerdynamic. In fact, due to the treble dip, I\u2019d say the treble is more on the inoffensive side. With the stock tonality, there\u2019s no sense of sibilance or sharpness. I think people would probably even say it sounds veiled compared to the HD6XX. The upper midrange is boosted quite a bit though, so if you\u2019re sensitive to shouty headphones, this might not be a good match. \n\nAs for its portrayal of timbre, I don't find it to be particularly special. In fact, the OAE1 sounds a bit \"dry\" to me, similar to the Fostex biodynamics or Beyerdynamic. The Aune AR5000 and the Sennheisers sound more natural and music flows together in a pleasing way. The blunted effect from the treble dip and the bass bloat also means you don't really get a lot of texture from sounds and instruments. That said, if you listen to other headphones after the OAE1, you\u2019ll probably feel like you\u2019re missing a lot of body and physicality in the sound.\n\nIn terms of soundstage size, the OAE1 seems just a little bit bigger than the HD6XX. The Aune AR5000, the Edition XS, Sundara, and Beyerdynamic all seem noticeably larger in soundstage. Part of the reason is likely because the OAE1's darker tonality makes it sound less airy and open. That said, I find the OAE1's imaging to be above average. Not quite as precise as the Edition XS or Beyerdynamic, but better than the HD6XX and AR5000 to my ears.\n\nNow in terms of soundstage presentation, the closest is probably the AR5000, which is also another headphone with offset drivers. However, the effect of having sound projected \"in front\" of me is not as strong. With the AR5000, I feel like I'm always in-between the vocals and the instruments, with the vocals projected in front and instruments behind. Other headphones like the HD6XX sound like everything starts from the center of my head. But the OAE1 projects everything in front, including the instruments (though the vocals still end up being the standout). Note that this is relative to headphones though, I\u2019m not getting anything like an out-of-head sound experience.\n\nResolution-wise, the OAE1 is okay, but not particularly competitive. The Edition XS, HD6XX, and Aune AR5000 are all more capable at pulling nuances out of the sound. However, I feel that the OAE1's tonality plays a large part. When you mod or use EQ, the resolution seems more appropriate to its price point. But listening stock makes the sounds seem more muted than you\u2019d expect. Even a bassy headphone like the Sony WH-1000XM4 has a level of clarity and airiness that the OAE1 lacks.\n\nIn terms of build and comfort, I feel that the OAE1 is built quite well. I like the small attention to detail like making everything flush and the quality of the materials they use. It feels a bit more premium than a Beyerdynamic DT series. That said, even considering that my head is a bit too big for the OAE1, the clamp force is just incredibly strong and the headband doesn't really provide much support. So while I find it better built than a lot of its competitors, it\u2019s the least comfortable headphone I\u2019ve tried in this price bracket.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA headphone that comes to mind when I think about the OAE1 is the now discontinued Sony MDR-MA900. This headphone looked quite similar and was also very \"open\" in design, basically being just two drivers hanging around your ears. What was impressive about it was that the soundstage was almost like a mini-HD800; it was large, spacious, and seemed to fully encompass my head. It also had surprisingly good bass response for how open it was, achieving a similar level to other open backs even if you took off the pads.\n\nNow based off the blurbs about the OAE1, that's the kind of headphone that I think a lot of people were expecting. But the OAE1 is something else entirely. It's a headphone that's grown on me because it does some things very differently like the sound presentation and the bass extension. And to be fair, once I get used to the OAE1\u2019s sound, I\u2019m actually inclined to call it an engaging headphone. But it's hard for me to really embrace the OAE1 because once you listen to pretty much any other headphone, the OAE1 sounds off and \"wrong\". I feel like to really enjoy the OAE1, you pretty much have to listen to it exclusively.\n\nSupposedly the OAE1 may have alternative parts that'd help you tune the sound more to your preference in the future; I hope that really does come because I think that would do a lot to help people appreciate the unique traits of the OAE1's sound.\n\nAs it is now, it's not something I can really recommend to people as a blind buy. But I do feel like there are certain niches that would enjoy the OAE1. I think people who want a thicker sound and care more about the feeling they get from music rather than the intricacies would enjoy this headphone. It's basically the antithesis of the clean, detailed, and clarity-focused sound that's been popular in the hobby. The other niche is for those looking for that one unicorn headphone; an affordable open-back that has bass like a closed-back.",

            "body": "I concur with many of your observations on the OAE1. I heard it at CanJam and it was, to me, a very odd-sounding headphone, but it did have moments of brilliance and some exceptional qualities. I agree that the bass is very powerful, not just for an open-back, but in general. And amongst open-backs, I think the only ones with comparable bass - based on my experiences - are the Abyss AB1266 and Raal 1995 Immanis. I remarked that it was very bassy to Axel Grell himself, who was at the table, and he responded that it was not too much bass; he claimed to have evidence that the bass tuning was akin to the bass one would hear from live music in a concert venue. I also thought the clamp force was somewhat high, but it wasn't immediately troublesome to me during the several minutes I listened.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the treble to be quite spiky and grating. Maybe those impressions are conflated with unevenness in the presence region which I am also sensitive to, but it sounded rather harsh and strange across the midrange and treble. I've read that a large dip around 6KHz can produce a sense of compression in the sound and that seems pretty consistent with what I heard. I also didn't find the sense of frontal localization to be all that consistent. With bass, it was noticeably in front of me, and with some instruments and elements in the music it also worked, but other times it didn't sound any more frontal than other headphones, leading to a disjointed, unnatural sense of space.\n\nHowever, after Grell told me about the venue intent with the bass tuning, I put on a song that I had heard performed live, without amplification, a few days prior to CanJam. No recording will ever sound exactly like a live performance, but with the live performance so recent, I still had a decent idea of what the \"real thing\" sounded like. And on that track (\"In mir klingt ein Lied\" by Chelsea Guo), I could get a sense of what the OAE1 was going for. The combination of bass and frontal space on the OAE1 produced a sound that reminded me of what I heard during the concert. It was certainly not completely accurate, and I could still hear plenty of coloration in the sound, but the overall presentation was reminiscent of that live performance. However, for studio-recorded/mixed music, which is like 95% of my library, the OAE1 just sounded all over the place.\n\nFor me, the main issue I have with the OAE1 is that I'm not sure if it does anything better than a CrossZone headphone. I heard the CrossZone CZ-10 Enhanced in Tokyo last December and I found that headphone to have a very consistent sense of frontal localization; more consistent than what the OAE1 achieved. There was also plenty of bass on that headphone, though not to OAE1 levels, and the midrange/treble, while noticeably colored, were not as harsh and weird. Plus, the CZ-10 was more comfortable with less clamp and I think plusher earpads. As it stands right now, if I wanted a headphone with that frontal localization trick, I'd be hard-pressed to choose the OAE1 vs a CrossZone.\n\nI asked some of the Grell Audio staff if they had heard a CrossZone and what they thought of the CrossZone approach to frontal localization. One of them knew of CrossZone, but Axel said that he had never heard one, so he couldn't comment on their design.",

But while the excessive bass does provide a lot of body and power, that to me feels like a headphone trying very hard to be something it's not. Like how a veggie burger trying to be like beef might taste worse than if it just took advantage of what the non-meat ingredients offered. The slam the OAE1 has conveys more of the physicality to me than the sheer bass quantity.\n\nOoo you've made me really interested in hearing the CrossZone, especially since the OAE1's a poor fit on my head. Maybe if I ever go to Japan again, I can demo it somewhere.",

The steep downwards treble slant also reminds me of the RHA CL2 IEM, which had similar complaints about harshness and compressed dynamics. The RHA CL2 was also said to sound \"fast\" with muted, quickly tapering-off decay on instruments like cymbals providing the illusion of detail, so I'd be interested to know if the OAE1's presentation was similar in that way, too.",

And you're exactly right, the vision for OAE1 is shifting the paradigm of how headphones should sound: While excessive detail is fun, I don't think it reflects reality well, be it from a concert or from good speakers. While my initial reaction to the OAE1 was exactly like yours, I can now easily switch between it and traditional headphones and appreciate the laid-back nature more. For example, I tend to get tinnitus from very bright headphones, and the OAE1 is (obviously) very forgiving in that regard. It can also make sense to just EQ the bass down by 2 dB. The quantity is simply unlike anything else in the category, and to me it removed some of the \"over-the-top\" thickness.",

I've only heard the OG, but supposedly the Elite cleaned up the bass response more so it extends better low. The OG had big thick bass, better clarity than the OAE1, and a spacious soundstage comparable to the X2HR.\n\nThe only other thing that comes to mind is the Fostex TH-900, that's also fairly spacious and bassy. The downside would be if you're treble sensitive as they have pretty peaky treble.",
