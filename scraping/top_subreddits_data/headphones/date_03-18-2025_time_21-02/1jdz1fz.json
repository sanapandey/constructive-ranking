One benefit is you can edit the .STL if you want to remove the beyerdynamic text/logo. Also you can make the slider of a stronger material than the standard ABS, something like nylon or ASA-CF.\n\nLink to the sliders .stl: https://www.printables.com/model/227951-beyerdynamic-dt-770880990-slider-replacement\n\nIf you don't have easy access to a 3D printer, you can also send the slider .stl to a 3D printing service like PCBWay (they ship everywhere in the world). They have lot's of printing/cnc options, sometimes with better materials than the original (like nylon or aluminium).\n\nJust saying it's an alternative. :)",

Comfort is very good, but not quite to the same level as the T1. \n\n\nThe T1 is my go-to media headphone, or if I just want to sit back and relax before I head to bed. To me the Noire X is more for active listening, and it tends to be more forgiving to tracks that already have recessed vocals.",

They can't hold a candle to my Mezes when I want an engaging midrange performance, but I knew that when I was getting them. The mids are there, but it sounds a bit like the music is coming through a sock xD\n\nI actually was considering getting the Noire X before the Poet came out... they're still on my bucket list :P",
