It is not easy or cost-effective to design and find small parts for an analog EQ that fits inside the space of a hiby fc1, and that's not even getting into making it sound good. Your EQ would also be limited to minor EQ functions, not the parametric stuff people want with control over shelves and Q widths.",

Then you can feed that into a regular DAC/amp which has EQ functions. \n\nYou may not want to convert your analog source to digital, which I would understand. But the results of handling EQ in the digital domain I think could sound better than using an analog EQ in the chain.\n\nOffhand, the only devices I can think of that do this are field recorders or field microphone packs (plug your mic in, and device converts to digital for rest of chain). In the audiophile space, the only one I can think of is Questyle CMA 18 Portable, a headphone DAC/amp that does does have a 3.5mm analog input for recording analog signals (but no EQ).",

I know that zero loss and distortion is impossible but surely one of them does the job better than the other.\n\nAs for field recorders/mic packs, I'd have to do more research into the topic, as I'm not too familiar with it, thanks for that idea too!",

You are right about common sense, but I was just asking about its existence, if there really aren't any, then I'm fine with that, I'll work on building my own, as I have done multiple times before with other problems I've had that didn't have a fast solution. I never implied that the world has to revolve around me, just looking to discuss, but you definitely seem to be mad about something.",
