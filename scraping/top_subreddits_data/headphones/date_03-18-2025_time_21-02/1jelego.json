Sennheiser HD660S2 \n\nBeen eyeing the following:\nMeze Empyrean/Empyrean II\nAudeze LCD-2/3\nOr wait a bit longer until Fiio release the FT7? Since I have been blown away by both the FT1 and the FT1 Pro! \n\nThanks in advance for any advice/pointers :)\n",

Literally is a high end HD 600, and if you love the 660 S2, you'll love those.\n\n\nEdit: If you're looking at Empyrean 2, also check out the HE1000 unveiled, literally the best headphone you can buy under $6k imo (and may even be better than the susvaras tbh depending on your preferences).\u00a0",

They don\u2019t have the widest soundstage ever but they\u2019re fun to listen with. Fast bass that slams paired with great detail and they do relatively well with EQ.  They\u2019re bulky for sure but I think most ppl are overplaying how uncomfortable they are. They\u2019re by no means HD600 or HD800S levels of comfort but they\u2019re fine.",
