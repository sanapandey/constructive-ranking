    "selftext": "Yeah, so long story short, back in I think 2012-13ish when I first started down the whole audiophile rabbit hole, I  naively posted to my local facebook page if anyone had some equipment to sell.  I got a message about a pair of H650\u2019s. It was an older fella, and amazingly he had kept everything - it was an Irish produced 2010 release, receipt, box everything. I immediately said yes. When I went to pick it up, he told me he had included every cable he had bought for it, even though he had barely 50ish hours on the headphones. This was one of the pairs. Aside from a couple internet posts there\u2019s not any personal/non-reviewer opinions about them. \n\nSo, for those that have actually listened or used this cable, what do you feel about them? Any opinions, good or bad?",
