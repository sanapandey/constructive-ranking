    "selftext": "Tenno,\n\nWith the arrival of Techrot Encore on all platforms on Wednesday, March 19th, we would like to help prepare you with some rough update sizes on each platform well in advance:  \n\n\nPC: \\~3.30 GB\n\nPlayStation 4: \\~32.00 GB\\*  \nPlayStation 5: \\~9.00 GB\\*\n\nXbox One: \\~6.03 GB  \nXbox Series: \\~4.04 GB\n\nNintendo Switch: \\~2.60 GB\n\niOS: \\~1.75 GB\\*\\*\n\n  \n**\\*PlayStation Remaster:**   \nOur PlayStation Tenno will notice a larger than normal build size since we have remastered Warframe\u2019s data to slightly optimize total disc space used. Unlike previous remasters, this update will not require a full re-download of the game.   \n\n\n**\\*\\*iOS Download Size:**  \nWhen Warframe updates via the App Store, it must redownload the base install (approximately 3.95GB) which overwrites the previous install. In other words, while CERT updates require a roughly 3.95GB download, these updates are not adding 3.95 GB to your overall app size. \n\nUpon the launch of the update, when you load the Warframe app, you will receive an \u201cUpdate Available\u201d popup as usual and be redirected to the App Store to do so.   \n\n\nThe stage is set for an Encore. The Technocyte Coda are waiting.",
