Most of them sit in a turret all mission even when it's a corpus proxima and you don't need to kill fighters. \n\nI usually run veil proxima void storms because it's a good farm of a lot of stuff but every time I have to do the mission 70% of the way by myself while my teammates play point and click adventure with my laser turrets.\n\nNeed another player to quickly snipe crewships with artillery? Well, good luck if they even know what it means.\n\nOur pilot stopped railjack right before the objective marker? Gee, I have this very important job of shooting at fighters, sorry, do it yourself. What do you mean I can pilot it myself and kill crewships in the meantime?\n\nI had one rhino who waited for *6 minutes* in corpus spy on veil proxima doing nothing when I thought they were doing the \"disable the target\" away mission. I had to fly there myself, enter it and press the terminal (thet were right on top of it btw) to start the signal jamming mission. Naturally, the other 2 members of the squad were playing with the turrets, so I had to kill all crewships myself too.\n\nAnother player, who also was a very avid enjoyer of keeping turret seats warm and appreciating the skybox, had the audacity to start leveling up their necromech instead of doing the spy mission.\n\n\"Oh, but they're just unfamiliar with the gamemode\" you might say. My response to it is that intrinsics 7 is a minimum requirement. I lost count how many people didn't even know that you can use your repair gun to tp to railjack.",

So I would let my vortex run out, and my teammates would run around and max out the efficiency. I'd throw another one, and they'd all gather, and the efficiency would drop. Then back up when it ran out. Then down again. So I just kept it going to see if they'd let the efficiency hit 0. It hit 0. Then I got another group that did the same thing. And another. And another.

Just came back from my most recent break and here's a list I can think of of all the new things I've had to figure out or relearn at once:\u00a0\n\n\n* Zariman and the void angels\n* Duviri (circuit, all the weirdness in the Duviri Experience)\n* Citrine mode\n* Random Dagath node\n* The labs and murmur stuff (I think this has been the weirdest)\n* Like 6 new main quests\n* Drifter\n* The Jade node\n* Archon hunts and shards\n* That grineer weekly quest\n* Netracell?\n* 1999\u00a0\n* Significant reworks of many frames or underlying systems (like companion stuff)\n* Incarnons?\n* Tenet weapons\n* Over guard and other gameplay overhauls (ie huge build meta swaps)\n\n\n\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure that's just the big obvious items. Lol. Each of those all have their own underlying quirks, currencies, game modes, and branching side content that you have to do as well or first to participate in that content.\n\n\nIt can be a lot! Did I mention Duviri? Lol. I really dislike that place.\n\n\nBut, none of those are excuses to not figure out what's what while you're in them ASAP. Alchemy is straightforward, so I still do my part in tossing the things at the thing.\u00a0\n\n\nEdit: and oh my goodness the number of new mods and arcanes and such is staggering. Half the builds I see have entire mod load outs that are unrecognizable. Lol. Serration seems to be a thing of the past",

I also wasn't confident in my Operator's ability to survive if I switched  \nThis is no longer a factor, of course- I know I can use void form, and I have other frames that can handle the content anyway",

In the circuit you don't really choose your exact loadout, especially when people just go in and give you no time to choose, so, you might get an incarnon, or a squishy frame, throwing amps while you have an incarnon equiped in that chaos might dissable it, just by a simple mistake when you don't actually have an amp in your hand. \n\nHappened to me a few times so i tend to not throw amps while I have incarnons.\n\n Or maybe it is a survivability thing, there are some frames that rely on kills to survive, like Nidus, more or less, Garuda, Gyre, more or less, depends on the build. Mostly it is bcs of those melee builds with Arcane reaper and grace. They rely on kills to survive. \n\nBut you know, there is always a chat in the lower left corner, you can always ask them to help, if they dissagree then you can always extract and go for a new, fresh run. Or power through the one you have bcs you got a very nice loadout, and overstay their presence. \n\nI hope other than that you had a pleasent experience in the circuit ^^",

Garuda can block all damage from her front, gyre has great CC. By the time you're going down fast you should have enough decrees to gain health back on kill/dot application.",
