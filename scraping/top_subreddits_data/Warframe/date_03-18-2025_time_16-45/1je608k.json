Especially if we've been using borrowed power this whole time (\"you owe me, kiddo\"). Plus it's a science fiction game with advanced space shit based off beaming your consciousness across vast planes of distance to pilot a suit, yet can drop in and out of the field of battle at the drop of a hat. It's not like it's grounded in current day reality at all.\n\nMaybe I'm thinking too far into it, maybe I'm in the weeds, maybe I'm too partial to the \"what if the other choice was taken?\" being explored for once as that's not commonly done... But that's how I've been seeing the whole \"do you accept my power\" choice the Operator was given in the Zariman and is possibly the creation of Drifter for the flip side as one who is not beholden to the enemy. If anything, I have more questions over how those two totally separate timelines got close enough to bleed into each other where we get both instances of one person.",

Twisted fate was originally straight and had a canon heterosexual relationship with Evelynn, who was a mercenary at that point in the lore. The writer for Graves wanted to fulfill her yaoi fetish and make TF gay, which was shot down until Riot needed to distract from more lawsuits. Varus was originally a man who took on a demon bow to save his village, only to discover it destroyed by the time he arrived, but is now a gay couple absorbed into the bow which is never mentioned and has no voicelines. Cait and Vi weren't a couple, and Vi called Cait \"cupcake\" because she put cupcakes on the Yordle Snap Traps to kill yordles before that was retconned. Diana and Leona were changed to be gay despite their lore being about the Solari genociding the Lunari(Imagine a story about a native woman falling for Columbus). Daniel Z Klein made the actual argument that Taliyah was meant to be trans because she was ugly.\n\nRiot's tokenism to distract from lawsuits is so transparent as to be gross. They and the playerbase treat these people like toys to show how moral they are.\n\n>They also forget at one point they only had one confirmed gay champion, the gem themed dude\n\nTaric wasn't gay, the playerbase just treated him as gay because he had a pink skin and wasn't scarred up.

Graves wasn't a thing before the game came out, he was released 2 years after. Then Runaan, who did not create Graves, wanted to make TF gay for a shipping fetish, and TF and Graves' writers shut it down.\n\n>Taliyah was similarly conceptualized as trans from the beginning\n\nYes, and DZK's argument for proving it was was that he made her intentionally ugly.\n\n>Not every gay couple has to be sunshine and rainbows.\n\nBut there isn't a positive example of LGBT representation in the game. Every couple is awful to the very core, either written as a toxic relationship or directly timed to sexual harassment accusations. The few not established to be in these toxic relationsips are only confirmed to be LGBT via devblog or twitter posts, so they simply haven't had a chance to write them into the modern Riot \"Gays can't have good relationships\" mold.\n\n>it is at least important to acknowledge that the writers of most of the queer characters typically had good intentions from the start.\n\nMost of the writers have explicitly stated their intentions, DZK to make an ugly character for trans representation, Runaan for a yaoi shipping fetish, and Varus for \"Please forget all the rape jokes.\"",

To keep things short, mages and technologists of every nation, both present and gone, through time had used their powers in open warfare. The greatest of these conflicts were the Five Rune Wars, althought the First was less amongst each other and more against eldritch horrors and the gods themselves.\n\nThis had caused incalculable damage across the world. Entire lands were so suffused with magic that mutation and cataclysm was abundant (all the talking animals and animal hybrid Champions before were a result of stable mutations). The greatest Rune Mages (top tier of all magic) of all nations arrived at the same conclusion: the Sixth Rune War would be the final. So they, together, proposed to the various nations the formation of the Institute of War, where their champions, both native and mercenary, would fight for their interests. \n\nWars were still allowed, but anything with the potential to escalate to the use of World Runes or old Runic Magic was solved in the League. Slowly, the League became both a political tool and an amusement to the masses, the champions who fought in the Summoner's Rift were protected from death while within.\n\nAll players were Summoners, newly trained to both handle the magic of summoning and guiding champions in the battlefield, while the Rune Mages became the High Summoners and Councilours.\n\nThe story also progressed. When conflict escalated in a village that possessed magical crystals that were a source of great power, Demacia and Noxus fought so hard and were using such powerful magics that the Summoners were forced to intervene. The crystals were reacting to the magic, and the only way to stop yet another cataclysm was by a spell that stopped time, but irreperably ruined the place that became the Crystal Scar, making it toxic to all life. They then turned it into a Summoner Battlefield, in a new game mode called Dominion.\n\nTo add to the punch, those crystals? They were part of a race of sentient creatures called The Bracken, crystal scorpions who hibernated after one of the Rune Wars in hopes of one day awakening to a world less hostile. The exploitation of the Crystal Scar killed many, and their vanguard, Skarner, emerged. The creature was not a monster, but a considerate being, a poet and scholar as well as a warrior. It wished not to harm people so it made an accord with the Summoners, joining the league to ensure that his people would be protected and safe while they slumbered, forever alone from his kind to ensure their safety.\n\nWhat happened to all of this?\n\nTen(?) years ago all got retconned, and slowly all of it got erased. Summoners no longer existed in lore. The Bracken got hit by lore change after lore change to fit a constantly changing, constantly rewritten lore until finally, recently, being erased, Skarner being turned into a \"regular\" scorpion/Land spirit and moved halfway across the world. Dominion, a fast paced game mode perfect for unwinding and having fun, got removed so they could 'focus on the main game' (they didn't Change a thing).\n\nAnd when they had finally hired a bunch of great writers, had their final retcons done, and once again had amazing regions and places filled with rich history... Arcane, originally an AU show, was successful, and they decided to make it Canon. Thing is, that destroyed almost all preestabliahed lore of its regions and we are once again in Limbo.\n\nRiot is an abusive parent to its game and needs its custody revoked.",

Especially since the original Excalibur from a previous DE game was indeed a suit.\nAnother factor to an image like this is that Warframe has gone through some pretty major lore changes and retcons throughout the years, like the very first quest in the game being completely changed. \nIn Warframes' earliest stages, a Warframe was mostly likely just the battlesuit of the Tenno, a race of highly skilled infiltration ninjas who relied on stealth, careful navigation, and a strict discipline in killing to disrupt the war efforts of the Grineer. As reflected in the oldest versions of Warframe. Over time, as the need to expand the game and give it depth, variety, and style became more prominent, so did the lore change.\nSo now, Warframes have gone from combat enhancement suits for space ninjas renowned for their stealth and assassination skills but otherwise maneagable to literal forces of nature that can move faster than the blink of an eye and can eradicate entire armies of their enemies with little to no trouble and are operated by children from a flesh control vessel.",

But Tencent had a stake in DE (now fully owns it) and Warframe China was rebranded and published locally, so it got held to local standards, the same ones that let Honkai Impact 3rd be a game about lesbians finding love while surviving a zombie apocalypse. You can see the same thing happen with movies, where Hollywood films get butchered before being allowed in Chinese theatres but domestic directors are making gory war movies and serious dramas about trafficked women and shit like that without issue. And books, where Japanese BL gets treated as pornography by default while domestic BL is a huge flourishing industry that's getting TV adaptations and shit.",

Back until Second Dream in December of 2015 we were still not even sure what the hell we _were_ and we didn't get full confirmation on what the warframes actually were until The Sacrifice.\n\nProtoframes I'm pretty sure was specifically them bringing back some of the Dark Sector ideas from when they had to compromise and make a game other than Warframe to get publishers to publish their game.",
