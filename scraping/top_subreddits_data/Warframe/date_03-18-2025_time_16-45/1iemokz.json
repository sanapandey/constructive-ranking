    "selftext": "Hello fellow Tenno,\n\nI am making this post, in conjunction with DE (https://bsky.app/profile/warframe.com/post/3lh2qvcbj2c2g), to announce to you all that the Warframe Wiki has officially migrated from Fandom to Weird Gloop! So for all your wiki needs please refer to [wiki.warframe.com](https://wiki.warframe.com) from now on!\n\n**Why did we move?**\n\nFor readers, [https://wiki.warframe.com](https://wiki.warframe.com) offers a completely ad-free experience which is something that has long been sought after by the community. The move also brings a more usable mobile interface for those that browse on secondary devices like smart phones and tablets.\n\nFor editors, our new host can grant a more personalized and tailored fit for our wiki, allowing greater control over our content and feel. This allows greater flexibility in how we edit, customize, and monitor the wiki.\n\n**What happens to the Fandom wiki?**\n\nThe Fandom wiki is now deprecated and no longer recognized by DE as the official wiki.\n\nHowever, it cannot be deleted by us. We ask that you please do not make contributions to it and instead focus your attention to [wiki.warframe.com](http://wiki.warframe.com). From here on, only the new wiki will be updated with the most up-to-date and accurate information. The old wiki will no longer be updated.\n\nWe will attempt to post announcements and notices on the old Fandom wiki to let readers and editors know about the move. If you know someone who is still using the Fandom wiki please let them know. The faster word gets out the better, as the goal is to reduce the Fandom wiki's SEO and bring up [wiki.warframe.com](http://wiki.warframe.com).\n\nYou will find that Google search results will still link to Fandom for a while. In such cases we recommend using the [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/) extension (available for most Chromium and Mozilla browsers) which will detect if Fandom links have corresponding [wiki.warframe.com](http://wiki.warframe.com) links and use those instead. This will be a huge help to us for getting the new wiki up above Fandom in Google's search results, so please consider using it.\n\n**Has Warframe Wiki team changed?**\n\nThe wiki team has not changed, all us active (and even inactive) admins and mods were a part of this process. Although most regular editors were not made aware until several days ago.\n\nFor those of you who are an editor of the Fandom wiki, you can transfer your account's contributions over at [https://wiki.warframe.com/w/Special:MigrateUserAccount](https://wiki.warframe.com/w/Special:MigrateUserAccount) to continue your work. All article edit history has also been migrated, so no contributions should be lost.\n\n**What is Weird Gloop?**\n\n[Weird Gloop](https://weirdgloop.org/) is a wiki hosting service created back in 2017 by the OSRS and RS wikis. Weird Gloop hosts the RuneScape, Minecraft, and League of Legends wikis. And now the Warframe Wiki officially joins the ranks!\n\nThis has actually been in the works since October of last year. With the help of DE (thanks especially Ronnie!), Weird Gloop's dev team, and some awesome members of our own team, the Warframe Wiki has found its new official home!\n\nIf you have questions feel free to drop us a line here or in our [Warframe Wiki Discord server](https://discord.gg/U8kPksk).\n\nI look forward to this new experience with all you potential readers and editors!",

If I gave a single fuck, I would not point it out in the first place.\n\nWhat I do dislike is how it went from only hateful and off topic comments, to anything people disliked.\n\nLike seriously, that's how it slowly turned from a forum to... it's current state.\n\nI already made a comment why it's not good to do so, so tldr: even if the comment is wrong, as long as it is on topic you can get more info why it is wrong. Reddits design causes downvoted stuff to be less seen by everyone, so only bland, basic comments get pushed up.\n\nCan't come up with a good analogy, but I'll try. If your friend were to get a bad grade on an exam, you'd want to get the paper back to see what went wrong, instead of not seeing it at all. It's sometimes easier to understand stuff by seeing an example of doing it wrong.",

A large benefit of the RS3 and OSRS wikis is that market prices and history are easily accessible in the same place as other information about the item.\n\nHowever, in those games, the prices are based on the in game market. Warframe doesn't have anything like the Grand Exchange, but even as a 3rd party website not associated with DE, WF.market is generally considered as *the* trading hub like what Zybez was for Runescape before the Grand Exchange. I would understand the plethora of reasons why a 3rd party resource shouldn't be belong on a wiki. I would also expect process of getting continuous permission from the folks behind WF.market could be an issue, though I definitely think it could be something that is mutually beneficial.\n\nThat being said, if something like that is in the works I definitely would like to help. I am comfortable working with the WF.market API and used to love making contributions to the OSRS wiki when I played the game.",

In the case of chrome it's usually more of a, type the site name in then hit tab and it lets you search directly from that site's search instead of going through google.\n\nI can't stress enough how useful this is on wikis you can use a lot as an ongoing online game player, and until google catches wind of what's going on with the new wiki this is a great way to not deal with them. Not sure how many people use it, though if advertised well they might.\n\nImplementing this should be fairly simple, but I don't know if the wiki admins not at DE have the power to do it. It should start with a simple element in the front page html, but there's a url in it that goes to an xml file elsewhere with a few more lines of data and I don't know if public admins can make a generic file there to handle it. All in all though implementing this is like, 5 or 6 lines of html I think.\n\nEdit: Noticing this is in the source code already huh, doesn't seem to actually work though for Firefox that's weird.\n\nEdit #2: Figured it out if this feature does interest you, here was the Firefox issue: The site name for the new and old one are the same, if one is added already it doesn't show you the add button, so it thought it was already there, so had to remove the Fandom one first.",

Half the reason they spam unrelated fandom wikis at you is because it partially enables them to \"link\" them together. A search on something like the old TBOI wiki throwing a warframe link at you that enough people click means links on the TBOI wiki and warframe wiki can contribute a small percent of clicks to *each other*, artificially bolstering their weight on results despite the content being unrelated. Sure, it takes enough clicks on those shoddy adverts and trending shite to even work and even then contributes only a small sub-percent of clicks from one to the other, but when a network is as large as Fandom is then it typically more often than not meets the minimums from unaware users just browsing for \"fun and interest\" rather than to actually persue information- the same kind that regularly take personality quizzes, for example- then it starts feeding itself as the increased search weight brings more users providing a greater daily probability of it occuring. This isn't the only thing they do, but it's the only one I can wrap my head around it- there are video essays on the matter and naturally they tend to be upwards of an hour because youtube has its own algorithm in need of scraping and exploiting to see any growth whatsoever.\n\nThis is, technically, against google's own terms and guidelines on \"appropriate\" SEO and should get it delisted, but google is long past actually giving a shit about running their own services correctly. Can't speak of whether other search engines have similar guidelines with similar rulesets or not.  \nBut, it also means as fandom increasingly dies out then so too will its \"SEO\". Weird Gloop outperforming literal cheaters is also all the more impressive, too.",

Some pages on Fandom will almost crash your browser. The same pages on Weird Gloop will load in seconds with no issue.\n\nWeird Gloop themselves also goes over on why they're starting to help more wikis migrate away from Fandom: [https://weirdgloop.org/blog/why-were-helping-more-wikis-move-away-from-fandom](https://weirdgloop.org/blog/why-were-helping-more-wikis-move-away-from-fandom)\n\nImportant points:\n\n\\- Fandom is very exploitative and anti-consumer (insane amount of ad space, AI slop, poorly-produced videos and content being prioritized over the actual page contents, etc)\n\n\\- Migration has been proven to improve editor morale and traffic\n\n\\- Fandom wikis are limited by what tech they can use in their pages, many being straight up impossible to implement. Weird Gloop offers a lot more flexibility. Because of this, theoretically, the new Warframe Wiki could have a monopoly on WF fan sites and even integrate sites like Overframe and [Warframe.market](http://Warframe.market) under the same domain if they wanted to\n\nAlso, the RAM usage says quite a bit!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68w4bbvl3ege1.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=b234229b01ce543c2fdf82624d42320f892d4b78",
