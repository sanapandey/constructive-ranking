We equip three Anti-virus Mods to stab the duet with.\n3. Only *one* of the three needs to be correct, and that one mod doesn't need to be in a specific slot.\n\n\nSo if you stab the duet and all three mods fail, you replace all three with new mods until you find the one that works. You then proceed to take out the two mods that don't work, replace them with the Potency Mods, and keep stabbing the duet until they run off to space to kill or convert the front man.",

At BEST you can get 10 per Void Storm in veil proxima provided it drops at its 30%ish chance. \n\nMost likely you\u2019ll only need to buy two of each EVER if you want to maximize them all: buy one with whatever element but that is at least 53% or higher, and buy one with your preferred element to infuse into it.\n\nValence Fusion\u2019s resulting elemental bonus percentage is just the higher bonus of the two, multiplied by 1.1, and if the result is over 58% then it just ups it to 60% anyways. In other words, anything lower than 53% is mathematically twice as worse as anything at or above 53% bonus.\n\n(I mean technically the REAL lowest is 52.72% but that\u2019s splitting hairs.)\n\nNOW FOR SOME FUN MATH\n\nAdversary Weapons can have a bonus between 25 and 60, and anything at or above 58 is rounded to 60, so their effective dice roll is to have a bonus between 25 and 57.99 (58 effectively).\n\nThis means that there are roughly 34 single percentage differences in bonuses they can spawn with. (25-57%, 57.00-57.99 as the \u2018effective\u2019 58%, and 60%)\n\nOf these, 53% and higher are desirable, which makes up 7 of the 34 singular percentage differences (53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 57.99, 60), roughly 1/5 of all possible bonuses.\n\nSince for Technocyte Coda Weapons, they will ALL be available at all times in the shop, that\u2019s effectively 13 chances for at least SOMETHING to show up with a 1/5 chance of good bonus percentage.\n\nThat directly means that there is only a 5.5% chance that NOTHING has over 53% elemental bonus. \n\nBut naturally you might not be interested in ALL weapons, so if you are only interested in say, 5 of them, then 5.5% jumps to slightly over 30% (effectively) which is unfortunate.\n\nSTILL, this is 1999 lich system is arguably MUCH better in terms of player convenience than\n\n- running capture missions on Saturn or Neptune endlessly until a Larva/Sister shows up with the weapon you want,\n\n- THEN having to take possibly up to and over an hour to go kill their thralls/hounds,\n\n- THEN get a weapon with a possibly not ideal bonus percentage to sit in your foundry forever.\n\nYou can just wait until Elenor has what you want, and then get it if she has it, and if not you can stockpile more currency for it by doing more Coda in the meantime.\n\n-\u2014-\n\n(Also I HIGHLY recommend getting the Tenet Livia from Ergo Glast if you can, it has great stats, the slash procs are MASSIVE with over 90% of its IPS being Slash, and its unique passive means you don\u2019t need Naramon)",

People avoid fights with their Lich because they can just save time by waiting for the symbol and killing their Lich, then. I think on average, it turns out to be around the same time but RNG can screw you over if you stab your Lich and you can end up playing several missions before you see it again.",
