Depends what you're aiming to do.  Me? I'm all about speed and boosting my hate incarnon spinning around and killing everything and it's mother in the time I can run through the map.\n\nYou absolutely do not need to cast pillage twice for full armor strip if you're running a proper power strength build, which absolutely everyone that wants a fast Volt is...you just have to hit the power cap for pillage to strip in one go.  It takes 328 power with 1x Corrosive Projection for full strip or 340 power strength plus Molt Augment maxed out.  Sure, it takes more power strength to fully strip than other options, but it's FAR better than other options if you can meet the requirements.  It synergies with Volt exceptionally well.",

I subsume Discharge out for Pillage in my weapons platform build because well, it's a weapons platform.  Pillage costing half the energy makes it infinitely spammable in comparison if energy is ever an issue (it shouldn't be though).\n\n*~~60~~ 250 kills with molt is stupid easy and a non-issue for anyone who knows what they're doing for a long mission, especially with the other requirements necessary for this build to work.  More power strength also solves that requirement.\n\nIt's not for everyone, just advanced players.\n\nI never bragged about my hours, just shared that I've used both builds extensively but the pillage one is far more friendly/easy/fun for *me* to play.  Nobody cares how many hours you've played, or me either for that matter, I was only sharing context.  But if you really want to brag, I'm a founder...big whoop.\n\nIn any event, we're talking about lofty builds and maximizing things like power strength.  In that context, building a 340 strength volt is very obtainable for players who are geared up.  In the end, it's all about preference.  I find capacitance doesn't quite give me the edge I want for maximum level content, but pillage does what I need from Discharge (give back shields) plus more (armor strip).  It's definitely not for everyone, but if you want a fire-and-forget super speed weapons build, there is no better option for Volt.  Literally strips armor from absolutely everything while you cruise through the map getting shields back with little to no effort while you kill everything.\n\nAlso, with that level of power strength (340), the 680% Shock Trooper buff blows subsumed Roar out of the water...but if you want to focus on Nuke builds than Shock Trooper doesn't help you there and Roar is preferred.\n\nIs it so crazy to think that both builds are great and it's a matter of preference?  Either way, Pillage is still king at what it does for shield-based frames *IF* you can meet the requirements.  That's the whole damned point.",

The vast majority of the time, I'm using it to replacement Discharge without me having to sit there and cast it.  Since I don't use Discharge most of the time, I don't worry much about having to buff Volt's casting speed at all since all of his other stuff is instant cast.  Everything I build for is for FAST without any pausing to cast anything because this is my go-to for most content in the game (I tend to not use it vs endless infested though since they don't have shields to give back to Volt when you pillage).\n\nSince I hardly ever use Discharge (except for nuke runs), this leaves me room to stack all red power strength tau shards or I convert 2 tau yellow shards over to velocity speed to jump fast too.",

You use a finisher to kill someone effected by desiccation, it spawns up to 5 sand Kavats.   \n  \nThese Kavats are unique in that their movement speed has a direct correlation to their damage. This damage is further increased by summoner's wrath. Arcane camisado gives you ability strength, which makes you speed buff faster, causing a feed back loop into the more they attack and do damage, the faster they go the more damage they do.   \n  \nYou also run the augments on your 1 and 2 as well giving them bonus electricity damage, which procs archon stretch giving you all the energy you could need. Which you will need a lot because with low duration your going to be spamming abilities a lot.  \n  \nFor survivability you have capactiance and large range, so constantly keep up your shields as well as those of your allies.\n\nSo basic play style is, hit enemy with desiccation, use finisher on them, spawn kavat, repeat up to 5 times.

This ability belongs to another warframe named Hildryn, but there is a system in the game that allows one ability from each warframe to replace any of the abilities on another warframe. So I use Pillage from Hildryn to replace the 1 (first ability) that Volt has.\n\nArcane Energize: Arcanes are passives you can unlock for characters and weapons that give bonuses. Arcane Energize increases the amount of energy you and your team get from orbs that drop from slain enemies.\n\nSteel Path: An optional mode that significantly increases the level of the enemies in a mission that is unlocked by completing all mission nodes on the star map.\n\nWarframe has a larger emphasis on abilities than Destiny, is 3rd person, and many of the weapons can be downright weird. The design of everything feels pretty alien which is cool. It has a much wider variety of things to do I think, but the PvP is pretty restricted and nearly non-existent. I don't know how Destiny does premium stuff, but in Warframe platinum can be traded between players so there is a functioning market for those who don't want to ever spend any money.",

In general, I'm fine with any ability, that affects me, and griefing for me starts with the intention. I can tolerate a weird Nova portal, I have no problem with dashing out of the Limbo's banish, if I got into his dash-portal or got banished suddenly, if all of those cases are rare and the player had no intention to cause problems for anyone.",

Saying that isn't the reason why people play Volt is disingenuous.   \n  \nThe top played frames, back up my point in every way, 3 of the top 5 all have speed increasing abilities. Hell you could even make the argument that 4 of the top 5 with Wukong and his cloud step is also a speed increasing ability. Volt is in the top 10 twice, which enforces my point even more. \n\n>But if 15% of the community thought that them being able to make aiming your guns horrible but your melee swing a bit faster, whether you want it or not, unless you backflip every 20 seconds, would that be just fine?\n\nYes, that would be fine, it's a multiplayer game. If there are other play styles or frames I don't want to deal with on that run, there is a magical button that says single player.  \n  \nIf you can't handle other people's builds effecting your own, maybe you shouldn't be playing multiplayer, it's kind of a core aspect of it.",

However, faction mods exist and are easily slotted in when playing Gauss as you no longer need to mod for fire rate. Sunder cares more about the number of casts and heat inherit gives it faction scaling as long as your inherit gun had a faction mod.\n\nI can assure you I'm killing plenty fast.

That and the fast cooldown and frequent recasting means its a waste of time to even try, because recasting reapplies even to those who canceled out of it.\n\nIn addition, some missions, you don't \\*want\\* to go fast, because going fast means not getting the spawns needed for the objective.

Same with Wisp, the utility isn't nearly as invasive and even if the electric flower can slow down defense it's a net positive. And the buff is basically constant, not 20s long. \n\nSeeing the other frames in top played, Imo if not for being a starter, easy, 1-2 button room clear potential and Eidolon hunting, Volt would struggle to make it to top 10. Even without losing the advantages, Volt Prime went 19.7% down in usage in 2024. The other speed frames are just too much better at it and don't lack in other areas. People like speed, not specifically Volt's speed, his speed is one of the least liked of the choices, but the most available and provides a lot besides speed. \n\nImo DE should change his 2, so tap applies a better speed buff to only him and hold is a weaker team buff.

Two different play styles, two completely different frames. Volt is no where near the best room clearer and that has very little impact on the people that pick him up. Volt for Eidolon, sure. He is amazing for that, namely for solo speed runs. A very small portion of the player base know and actually do Eidolon hunts. \n\nIf you combined Volt and Volt prime he would be the most played frame every single year. \n\nI do like the idea of a push/hold for the speed it would indeed be a nice QoL.

We didn't have a choice. These new sources of speed just don't work with Volt. Times change, the game changed, Volt got left behind bc outside of niche things he was never too weak or too strong or abusable (like afk Wukong). \n\nAnd using words like challenging playstyle?

No one gets butthurt or upset over a mosquito buzzing around at night, you're just mislabeling how people feel about it to make them seem like the problem.

You probably also don't understand or realize that you become tanker when under the effect of Volt's speed, as enemy accuracy is calculated by how fast you are moving compared to them, faster you move, the less accurate they are, therefore less you get hit.\n\nPeople in general still like having Volt around, it's the whiny minority that shouldn't play multiplayer games like yourself that have an issue with him.

All I saw was that people play volt a lot which I agreed with. \n\nI know how speed works with accuracy, I don't care for it. I supply myself with speed via mods and archon shards so I can go fast as whichever frame I like. Adding a speed buff from a Volt prioritizing ap over duration tends to cause things like getting stuck in walls/floors. Not running into things, but literally getting stuck in terrain bc such speeds are not really supported by the game. The helminth ability for increasing parkour velocity would be infinitely easier to handle. Or if it affected only sprinting and not movement in general. But then if I don't equip my frame with speed increasers and then don't get a Volt I'll be painfully slow but I can't predict future or blacklist frames in matchmaking. \n\nSure Volt's playstyle is being fast and I see no issue there, not trying to stop it. But making other people run quickly isn't part of Volt's playstyle, more like an aura mod, except not constantly active. I'm sure new players who don't yet have access to better ways to go fast appreciate it. And if it's his playstyle, why does it have such a short duration? \n\nAbout bias, like you might see in the other comments, many people who find it annoying don't mention it in chat or anything, me included. So if you mean people don't mind it based on in game chat, it's really not a reliable metric. Naturally there's no point bothering the volt about it, not the players fault the ability is outdated.",

Speed based frames take up 3 out of the top 5 slots. This tells me the majority of warframe players enjoy speed.\n\n>I know how speed works with accuracy, I don't care for it. I supply myself with speed via mods and archon shards so I can go fast as whichever frame I like. Adding a speed buff from a Volt prioritizing ap over duration tends to cause things like getting stuck in walls/floors. Not running into things, but literally getting stuck in terrain bc such speeds are not really supported by the game.\n\nThis tells me you are not very good with tile layouts or movement tech in the game. Aside from a few certain tile sets or Titania movement with Volt's speed can be utilized very well with proper movement tech and tile set knowledge. \n\n>But making other people run quickly isn't part of Volt's playstyle\n\nYes it is. making other people move quickly has always been part of his kit since 2013. That is like saying buffing people's damage isn't part of Rhino's kit. Or that motes are not meant to support other players when playing wisp. Making the team move quickly IS a core part and always has been of Volt's kit.   \n  \nAs to why it has such a short duration, I couldn't tell you, I'm not part of the design team, I do think the duration should be extended though.\n\n>About bias, like you might see in the other comments, many people who find it annoying don't mention it in chat or anything, me included. So if you mean people don't mind it based on in game chat, it's really not a reliable metric.\n\nBy many people you mean a few redditors. This post hasn't even broke 1k comments yet, not a very large sample size. As for bias, Look at my first paragraph, I use actual players numbers of warframe, not reddit comments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qd4b8enpshpe1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=5717c5e9c90936c46698836c34aa58dc6cf291f4",

However, if you haven't had a chance to play one of the frames with innately high speed, especially alongside a Volt, it's easy to think someone just can't handle the speed. I was testing some things with a friend while using Ivara at 1.86 speed, and my friend was running a high strength Volt that I think had around a 3.46x speed buff(if memory serves), so my Ivara was hitting approximately 6.44 speed. I was literally running circles around his Volt. So when we buff people's speed, we have to recognize that some of the other Warframes may end up going DOUBLE Volt's speed.\n\nAfter seeing a number of comments about opting out, I'd love DE to add a section to each Warframe that allowed us to choose which buffs we accept, and which ones we don't.

Volt breaks them. \n\nI wish, when playing specific warframes, I could blacklist certain other frames. Volt for example when playing Titania and Gauss. I get why they changed Dante\u2019s OG thing because it broke Chroma and Styanax(?) but isn\u2019t this the exact same case with Volt and some frames? Why did they only change Dante and leave Volt and Limbo the way they are? (Also wide range Khorra on any non defense missions with any melee frame such as Umbra) At least Wisp\u2019s electric mote in defense missions is just a matter of not realizing it makes the mission slower, but Volt nearly breaks Titania and Gauss, and outright breaks them if it\u2019s bad enough. One time I couldn\u2019t even get to extraction because I was clipped through the walls.",

Under speed boost she moves so fast I sometimes move so fast the infrastructure doesn't render in.

LIke i can understand a new player getting confused as to why they randomly speed up, but the natural follow up would be asking how to make it stop right? 6 years is genuinely crazy to not know basic info like this, especially considering how often people complain in the fandom about stuff like this.",

Volt has so many tools at his disposal that many of his builds differ significantly.\n\nNot only can he offer the ability to clear rooms, but he has other things like crowd control, shields you can shoot through, and straight up damage and speed buffs that benefit the entire team.

You're arguing semantics to move goalposts when you already understand what I mean. Volt gives direct buffs you can't find easily in the game. Armor-stripping is great, but not as useful as it used to be and nearly every warframe in the game can offer it, especially with the helminth system and weapons being able to do the same thing. \n\nWhen it comes to support, Volt's going to do it better every time. That isn't to say that everyone needs support in Warframe, though. Most Warframes, like Gauss, are built to be one-man armies that do not rely on others. I'm just saying that when it comes to support, Gauss is not beating Volt. There is no way where that holds true when a majority of Volt's abilities are built specifically to benefit teammates, whether they like it or not. Even his first ability has an augment that allows him to cast it on allies.\n\nRegardless, this is a silly argument that extends far past the point. However, saying \"Gauss supports more/better so just play him\" is a very poor argument to the discussion. You can move the definition of support as much as you want, and it still doesn't hold true. Volt players do not need to move over to Gauss because the playstyles aren't even similar. If this is some broader issue, it's something DE needs to fix or Speed haters need to play solo from. As someone that's been playing for 12 years, my advice will always be to get used to the speed and pretty colors on your screen. It'll do more favors for you than trying to avoid it. I tell this to every new player I guide across the system.",

Most people play him as a weapon platform. Thermal Sunder is great, but a lot of people overwrite it with the Helminth when it comes to Gauss. Overframe might suggest a different picture, but that's really how it is.\n\nNo one is on a high horse. It's just wrong to say that Gauss and Volt are equal in terms of what they bring to the game. It's also wrong to say that someone who plays Volt should just play Gauss instead. I've never met anyone playing for 12 years get upset with Volt because his Speed has been there since the beginning.
