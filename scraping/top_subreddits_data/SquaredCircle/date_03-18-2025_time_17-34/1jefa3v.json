Tazz unfortunately wasn't believable as a wrecking machine, as his kid isn't in this day and age. \n\nThe reality is you have UFC where guys cut weight to get an advantage and then there's WWE - where a 5'6\" is clotheslining and bodyslamming a guy he is significantly shorter than and significantly lighter in weight. \n\nThere was no \"blurred lines\" during that generation. \n\nHook is today's example. How the Fook is he going to choke out Braun? Or Roman? Or anyone over 6'2? \n\nJust the reality.",

If that's your gimmick you have to make people believe it, and even then you have to make it entertaining. If that shit is going to go south on goldberg and everything he had behind him how are you going to make it work for Taz? \n\nLike I can be watching RVD, Sabu, Joel Gertner, Corino, the pittbulls, the dudleys, super crazy vs tajiri - all this fun stuff, and I wanna watch sourpuss taz make people line up to take his suplex and then slap a choke on them not cracking a smile?
