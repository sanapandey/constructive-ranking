Cena drops the mic and goes to walk off which gets more boos before returning to pick the mic back up. Cena says people shouldn't put themselves aside for others approval and tells the fans they are making this so easy for him. For 25 years he's been the victim of an abusive relationship and shouts down another round of boos saying they lose their time to talk. He tells them to take the floor and do what they always do, yell at him and bully him into being their damned puppet. The crowd chants fuck you Cena. He calls them classy and says thank you. Cena says he isn't a babyface or a heel, he's a human being and each and every one of them has been awful to him and it's been the same damn noise for 25 years! When he first got to WWE they let him know that they hated him, moments of embarrassment and shame when he was told he wasn't good enough then he tried to change himself for their approval but it wasn't enough. Then he worked hard as he always did and he won and he won and he won and they hated that too. For the last 10 years he gave away every piece of his life to these people and it still wasn't enough. The crowd tells Cena to shut the fuck up. In his final moments Cena says all he can do is walk away and announced his retirement in a way that's never been done before, one last time he tried to do something nice for them and it was never enough. The crowd starts singing Hey Hey Hey Goodbye. Cena says each one of these idiots are proving his point with every breath, they are proving is that all he did was never enough. All they did was take and take and take and only cared about himself. Cena put his ideals on the lines, his story changed, Cena was coming to their town and all the fans cared about was what they got. Cena says what all these son of these bitches earned is nothing! Cena says they don't get a new look because now he gets to look like the rest of you idiots, you don't get a new song because that's his voice on that song and his time is now! The fans start chanting for Cody and says he's the shiny new toy because this one is about to be put out to pasture and Cena says they are proving what awful people they are and he can point them all out with the ones wearing his new shirt, the \"let's go Cena\" people. Dueling chants start. He says the Cena sucks jack-off have already proven themselves to be awful people now it's time to show why the Let's Go Cena people are just as bad. He points out people in the crowd and ask what have they ever done to support him? All they ever have done is steal from him, his personal moments, his time, they turned him into a toy and made him the butt of a stupid invisible joke for the past 15 years and calls them pathetic! Cena says they aren't ready to lean into an uncomfortable conversation, they don't wear this shirt out of respect they do because it makes them feel good. They buy the words hustle, loyalty, and respect while he actually lives them everyday. Cena says that he used him as an excuse for their own failures and says everyone in this crowd including that kid right there is a toxic, abusive relationship. He says he's breaking up with all of them, they are through and there is no noise they can make because they know he is right and they are all wrong. Cody Rhodes makes his way out to the ring to a massive ovation. Cody says he thinks everyone was willing to hear Cena out and while it's true the fans just gave Cena their worst they've also gave him their best because they knew he was special and that he could carry it. Cena says listen kid but Cody quickly cuts him off with enough! Cody tells him it isn't kid, it's WWE Champion and asks Cena who the hell are you? Where's the guy on this shirt? Even after what he did Cody says he was excited to go face to face with John Cena but instead he's going against this and hopes this doesn't show up at Wrestlemania because if it is he'll run it over and retire him early and tells him to go find the real John Cena because that's who he wants to face at Wrestlemania not this whiny bitch! Cody leaves bad up the ramp as Cena stares him down from in the ring. Cody goes to the back as Cena drops the mic and leaves as well, picking his towel back up as the crowd starts singing Goodbye once again. Before he walks to the back Cena looks behind him and shakes his head. \n\n* Penta is interviewed after his match, he thanks the fans in Brussels and says they were amazing. He says the Penta era is alive in Europe and every continent in the world and what's next for him? The Intercontinental Championship! He doesn't care what he has to do and shouts in Spanish before finishing with Cero Miedo! \n\n*  In the Clubhouse Liv wishes luck to Finn Balor in his match tonight and Finn returns the favor to Liv and Raquel in their upcoming matches and says next week him and Raquel will both be IC Champion. Dominik comes in and Finn is excited to see him but Dom says he thinks they could use some more muscle in the Judgement Day and suggests adding Penta. Finn's mood sours and says he can't believe Dom would suggest they add the man who just announced he was going after HIS Intercontinental Championship and says Dom is a snake before leaving. Dom tells Carlito he had no idea about Penta's intentions and Carlito asks if he watches the show.\n\n* During Ivy Nile vs Dakota Kai Rey Mysterio and Dragon Lee run down to attack the Creed Brothers before chasing Chad Gable out into the crowd.\n\n*Iyo Sky and Bianca Belair are in the ring with Adam Pearce for their contract signing. Pearce welcomes the fans in French and tells the two that the floor is theirs. Iyo tells Bianca that she won't disrespect her again neither will Rhea or anyone else because she is Women's World Champion and after Wrestlemania she will still be champion! She signs the contract and takes in the ovation from the crowd. Bianca says she has all the respect in the world for her but last week she gave her a pass because it was lowkey her fault, but if Iyo ever puts her hands on her again she's gonna find out why she is the EST and at Wrestlemania she will be walking out as Women's World Champion and signs. Pearce thanks them for being so professional and getting things done when they are interrupted by Rhea Ripley making her way to the ring, Pearce calls for referees and asks Rhea what she's doing out there. Rhea says how could she not be after what Bianca did to her and asks Bianca what business she has doing out here since last time that happened she lost her title. Bianca and Rhea argue as Iyo goes to cut in and Bianca blocks her from going for the slap and but Rhea headbutts Bianca causing her to fall onto the table, in the chaos Rhea power bombs Iyo on top of Bianca and takes the contract and signs it before walking off with it.\n\n* Jey is about to head out for his match and says he hasn't been feeling himself lately but he's ready to get himself back halfway around the world and Yeets. He runs into GUNTHER who insults him and Jimmy as Adam Pearce and officials come between the two before things come to blows. \n\n*  GUNTHER attacks Jey after his match and locks in the sleeper but Jey is able to break free by ramming GUNTHER head first into the turnbuckle. The two brawl and Jey rips the title off of GUNTHER. GUNTHER charges but Jey ducks and sends him to the outside and poses with the title before throwing it at GUNTHER. \n\n* Rhea and Pearce are arguing backstage and Pearce tells her she's acting like a child and Rhea says she'll give him the contract when he adds her to the match. Pearce demands the contract and Rhea passes it to him as she continues to argue with him but she is attacked from behind by Bianca Belair. Iyo tries to go after Rhea as well but Bianca tells her that Rhea is her and the two fight until Rhea recovers and lays them out. \n\n* The mysterious American luchador attacks Rey Mysterio and Dragon Lee after their match, hitting them both with overhead suplexes before going to the top and tells the crowd to shush and hits Dragon with a diving Headbutt before running through the crowd as security rushes to grab him. \n\n* Seth Rollins makes his way out to the ring and welcomes the crowd to Monday Night Rollins. He says he'll get to CM Punk after the crowd chants for them but first he's got business with Roman Reigns, Seth says he isn't mad that Roman came after him because he'd do the same damn thing but says even after all these years Roman can't come up with a plan, he needs his architect to plan things out because he left out one little factor, CM Punk. Seth calls Punk the luckiest loser on the planet since Roman stopped Seth from stomping Punk's head through that ring and putting his career on ice and saving the rest of them from the CM Punk problem but now once again he has to clean up Roman's mess. Seth promises to put the OTC in his place along with Punk and luckily Roman and Punk will be at the same place on the same time on Friday and wondered why they should have all the fun and thinks it's time he takes a little trip to Italy and put himself between the two of them. But that's Friday, tonight it's about Brussels and says they've been a great crowd and asks them to sing one last time as he makes his way to Smackdown. \n\n* Backstage AJ Styles is interviewed, he says he stands behind every thing he said about Logan Paul last week and that he doesn't belong on their roster. Karrion Kross interrupts and says maybe AJ isn't actually mad at Logan Paul, he's mad at himself. AJ says he's heard enough when Kross grabs him and asks how long it took AJ to get to WWE, 16 years? AJ says 17 and Kross says it must eat him up to see someone like Logan accomplish all of AJ's dreams in record time. AJ says whatever Kross is planning it isn't working and walks off as Kross turns to Scarlett and says it's working and they both laugh.\n\n* Following the main event Dominik and Carlito attack Bron Breakker and Dom grabs the IC Title to try and attack Bron but they are interrupted by Penta! Penta lays out Dom as Bron spears Carlito. Penta picks up the IC Title and stares down with Bron before shoving it to Bron who holds up the title. Penta tells him Cero Miedo and taunts. \n__________________________________________________\n\n**SHAMELESS PLUGS**\n\n* [Live Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jdj733/live_wwe_raw_discussion_thread_march_17_2025/)\n\n* New to /r/SquaredCircle?

Plus, the reception they gave Cody was great, They love him!.\n\nI've already seen comments on twitter about how Cena held back with Cody and I don't understand, did they want him to just bury him like Theory, breaking kayfabe just to look good?, This first exchange was everything it needed to be. Cody saying he wasn't impressed with this whiny Cena and wanting to see the best version of him at WrestleMania is exactly what his character would do.\n\nIt's not like Cody hasn't been cooked before by guys like Roman and The Rock during their feuds, but that's what makes him a great babyface, Cody isn't afraid to be vulnerable or affected by his opponent's words, which makes his rivalries interesting.",

Cena isn't giving you it. The Main event and upper mid card already has a load of badass heels with fans going \"they're right ya know\". This is actually comparatively fresh and interesting and its bugging people to see Cena be the antithesis of everything he is. I really hope they don't flinch with this, its clearly working with the majority.",

Not only because the story beats have been poorly paced, they're also not treating Jey like a serious competitor, as a combatant willing to put his body and soul on the line for the title. The writing is a bit lazy and WWE is relying on the easy singalong of Yeet and Gunther's talents as a bully heel to carry the story forward.

I have things to say about the first three but we can table it for another day.\n\nAs for Gable, I have a friend who has a theory: Gable is being punished right now for using leverage last year during contract negotiations. Triple H opened the bag for him because he didn\u2019t want to lose him to AEW but now that Gable has his money, he is being \u201cpunished\u201d for it in kind by going straight back into comedy territory.\n\nI don\u2019t keep up with contract news to a T so make of that what you will. All I know is that the Gable we are seeing now is a far cry from his presentation heading into Mania last year against Gunther. If I had to make a prediction, I do not see him holding singles gold this year at all despite the fact that his current gimmick goes hand in hand with the US Title. Considering Triple H\u2019s glacially slow creative pacing, I would expect this American Luchador gimmick to last well into the summer.\n\nAs for the Creeds, well\u2026 I suspected this would happen a while ago when Brutus started doing his annoying laugh. I was like, \u201cUmmm\u2026 isn\u2019t this supposed to be a serious, no-nonsense faction?\u201d\n\nTurns out, Brutus is actually a dumbass. Sigh.

I do like that he attacked even the fans that support him so the fact that the fans have overwhelmingly cheered him for the last 5-7 years doesn't erase his pain and anger and its not just about the booing, its about being a puppet for the fans.\n\nThen I'm curious when he made this conscious decision as he was happy-go-lucky Cena at 1/6 Raw and was very face like at Royal Rumble even congratulating Jey in the ring.  It wasn't until the post-show PC that he showed a heel side to him.  Was it always festering inside him and The Rock had him embrace the pain and resentment as he believes he needs to embrace that side to beat Cody and become The Rock's champion?\n\nJust kind of talking out loud here, I'm sure all these things will be addressed over the next few weeks.",

When he went Hollywood to come back once a year, the fans started cheering him, because they want him to stay behind and wrestle some more. \n\nOf course there is some flaw in his reasoning, otherwise he won't be a badguy, it definitely seems that the switch happened post RR when he realized 17 could be slipping away. I think Cena reached out to the Rock, having been Cody, he knew Cody would never accept, and struck a deal with the Rock to be his guy. \n\n\nI do hope we get more explanation about what is going as tbh some parts of the promo didn't really make sense",

Sure, Jey shouldn't done that botched move and all that, and sure, people for some reason have massive hate boners for both Rhea and the subjective perception they have towards her booking. But, I think judging by the crowd reaction, I think it was a decent show, so let's focus on the upsides of this. The John Cena promo ruled, Cody did good as well. Penta v Ludwig Kaiser ruled, Dakota Kai getting a W, and Bron retaining (and getting over with the crowd) is more than enough for me to think it's not as awful as people here make it out to be. Sure, some things can be better, but it's still a long way until WM41, so we'll just have to wait and see how these stories and matches progressed. Plus, also judging by the reaction in this thread, I think fellow Americans got some cultural shock in terms how they took in the Belgian crowd being rowdy and giving serenades to Seth Rollins and to AJ Styles briefly. \n\nIn other words, 8.5/10 show",

Could have easily called it out to Pierce, got him to agree that the most equitable way to handle this is a triple threat between Iyo, Bianca and Rhea.  \n\nBut instead it's just angry Rhea forcing herself into the match and will eventually somehow either get Pierce or get Iyo and Bianca to agree to it.

The in ring action was fun and both teams have found their groove character wise. Ga amble is also somehow taking something so goofy and completely selling me on it. He needs a major payoff in 2025.\n\nCody cena was a good chapter 1. I feel like cenas program did a good job at keeping the affair serious and keeping him unlikable rather than trying to make him cool, and I think cody did a great job appearing above it all. Its crazy to say but cody felt like the bigger star that segment.\n\nPenta and kaiser was fine but felt incredibly tame for a no holds barred match.\n\n One womans match was annoying as well. Especially given how short it was. I was a little taken aback by how over dakota was. I see a lot of dakota fans online but I've never seen it translate irl like this did and I could tell kai was loving it which made me happy. \n\nI'm going to hold off my opinion on the rhea stuff for another couple of weeks, but my initial gut reaction is that if rhea wins at mania after the way shes behaved I will have lost all interest in seeing the character. I think shes supposed to be the kickass never take no for an answer babyface similar to an austin, but the problem is shes doing it to two women who I'm significantly more behind so it's just super annoying to me. I want to give it time, but I'm wary especially after how the summer with liv went.\n\nSpeaking of which, being a judgment day fan must be pretty painful. They are rapidly approaching genuine jobber levels of incompetence. Dom and finn never win, and have been teasing the same story for months. I also hope that dom name dropping penta wasnt hunters sneaky way of trying to resolve the new member plotline since that would be very annoying. Livquel are busy doing the work to build up other people's mania matches while still having 0 direction as a tag team at the four week mark. I dont really know why they are heels since they arent threatening and I just feel bad for them most nights. Everyone in the group is talented in their own right and I really hope that especially finn, dom and liv get proper main event runs where they're treated like actual credible challengers and not hot topic 3MB.\n\nOh jey was also there and apparently cant do a squash match without botching something which is... yeah. I've really tried to be open minded about jey, but they've made it so hard since I've had to watch the man put on stinker after stinker, while at the same time being teased with actual fantastic gunther matches.

Besides, unless you didn't saw last week's Raw segment, it's clear there's this tension between Rhea and Bianca that's boiling, and to me, it feels like it's gonna be a retention for Iyo, because if we're going by this storyline, the fact both Bianca and Rhea are obsessed over one another, Iyo will take advantage of it and get a W. Plus, I don't think you don't need to put Iyo under the bus because you don't like how Rhea was booked, it's clear Iyo deserve a good title reign, and I think people just need to let this feud cook, and once that match in WM41 is concluded, THEN we can decide whether or not it was worth adding Rhea to this match.",

It\u2019s a two and a half hour show\u2026\n\nSpeaking of Rhea, the promo she cut after she lost the belt versus what is being presented on TV couldn\u2019t be more different. There is a disconnect there. Also, why not invoke her rematch clause instead of doing the contract stuff?\n\nWhere are the War Raiders?\n\nI feel bad for Finn, his main roster run got off to a bad start with the shoulder stuff but him coming out to no pop is disheartening.

We all know how good he is on the mic, and his longtime schtick is to put wrestlers over in the ring but stay over on the mic.\n\nCena turning on the fans because they gave him heat as a face for so long is really the only way to play that, especially since the source of that heat was fans getting sick of Vince forcing it for revenue. The one thing he absolutely cannot do is play heel straight; that just won't generate the heat -- worst-case scenario it starts generating pops because longtime fans have wanted to see Cena get another heel run for so long -- and as a result Cody's push gets undermined.\n\nIf anybody in the roster is up to the task, it's Cena. He and creative are playing it right -- his unconventional \"I'm not giving you what you want\", subverted pipe bomb, heel angle couldn't be better. That's not going to be a particularly comfortable watch because it's a real \"jerk-ass has a point\" angle, but it's what gets him the heat he needs to put Cody over.\n\nOr to put it another way, everyone's been trucking out the \"live long enough to become a villain\" quote from TDK in relation to Cena. I'd suggest a better one is that Dr. Thuganomics is the heel we deserve, but not the one we need right now.",

Do we end up right back at square one, all saying \"Cena's 'last time' heel run was so good, we want him back\" and forcing WWE to continue banking on attitude and ruthless aggression era wrestlers?\n\nWhether or not SCSA will perform at WM41 is bigger news than Cody's push right now. How sick we all are of Rock -- and that's not kayfabe heat, that's legit heat getting worked -- is bigger news than Cody's push right now. I'm not talking about just within the wrestling community, I'm talking about the mainstream. Banking on stars from nearly thirty years ago just isn't a sustainable business practice.\n\nGetting Cody is both a miracle and a curse, and already pushing the point of endless nostalgic recursion that *will* kill WWE sooner than later. He deserves this push and time as WWE's top face, but let's face facts, he's 39 soon to turn 40.

You\u2019re fine to disagree, but don\u2019t try and tell me that the issue you have is that mine is just a negative opinion and not because said opinion is about someone you presumably are a fan of.",

Of me saying I don\u2019t like Penta and even reiterating that it\u2019s because of how they\u2019ve got him booked to look untouchable (which I find boring regardless of who they book this way) ruins your enjoyment, then I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s on you not me. I personally find it silly to withhold anything possibly negative because the show was good. I again don\u2019t necessarily buy that had I started my post saying Jey sucks or something and left my opinion about Penta out of it that we\u2019d even be having this discussion. \n\nAnd it being my main takeaway, I guess maybe because he showed up at the very end? And they\u2019ve been showcasing him imo too much since his debut. If winning the IC title brings him back down to earth with the likes of Kaiser, Bron, Finn, Styles, etc, then awesome. Maybe I\u2019ll turn around on him. It\u2019s happened plenty of times with me.\n\nEdit: and for someone arguing for positivity, you came at me a little harsh did you not?",

Just look what happened with LA Knight, he main evented Crown Jewel against Roman Reigns and was in a 4 way with Randy Orton, AJ Styles and Roman Reigns. He was put into a programme with AJ Styles after that and then put into the US Title picture. He was pushed to the moon cos we all wanted it. Jey is no different.

It's pretty crazy that for both rumble winners, I'm entirely disinterested. \n\nMaybe it's just me, but this feud feels beneath Gunther and I know that was a literal plot point, but it actually feels like it's bringing him down. He felt more dominant and distinguished as the intercontinental champion. \n\nWhen Jey won I was surprised and maybe a bit disappointed, but I was ready to see what they'd do with it. If Gunther squashes Jey at mania, I really wouldn't care. It doesn't help that I still don't see the world heavy weight title as meaningful. \n\nWhen the WWE champion is very clearly at the top of the mountain and shows up on both raw and smackdown, it makes the HWC feel superfluous. I know people call it the work horse championship, but that's what the IC title has always been in my mind, with the US title being the low to mid card title. \n\nMaybe there's just too many championships being thrown around right now? \n\nI'm so ready for the Seth/Punk storyline to be over. I'm looking forward to the triple threat, but I absolutely need Punk or Roman to win. I'm sick and tired of this bitchy chip on his shoulder stuff Seth has been spewing for months. \n\nThe women's triple threat was set up about how I expected and I'm really looking forward to that one.
