It makes me know that I have true fans out there that really enjoyed my career and loved me for what I did. I\u2019m just grateful that they\u2019re going to drop the name Perk Angle. It reminds me of a dark time in my life, and it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t want to have to deal with it anymore. I dealt with it already, and it\u2019s behind me. Hearing Perc Angle just makes me think I\u2019m known for that. It was not cool. I\u2019m just glad that they\u2019re now using Peak Angle, instead I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d",

I would imagine that if any wrestler gave a heartfelt, genuine statement on how much a certain chant hurts them, the chant would probably end up being retired by most of the audience (even if a small segment would end up shouting it all the louder).\n\nI think most wrestling fans aren't bad people like that. Our worst are pretty noisy and obnoxious though.",

This coincided with other person issues, such as a divorce, DUI's... He was also putting on some of the best professional wrestling matches of his career during this stint. This caused someone to coin the moniker \"Perc Angle\" to describe this portion of his career.\n\n\nWell, jump forward and Kurt understandably doesn't view this nickname with warm happy thoughts, and basically said it hurts his feelings and would rather not be reminded of those demons he overcame.
