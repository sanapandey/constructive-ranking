We haven\u2019t seen a live audience reaction to them recently aside from Nikki at the Rumble, who did get a reaction from the live crowd. We\u2019re talking about the response in these Reddit comments, and we know that Reddit is an inaccurate representation of the live audience\u2019s emotions because we see Jey Uso hate on Reddit that doesn\u2019t translate to live crowds. \n\nBut furthermore, my point is that they\u2019re humans and these comments are all coming at it from a wrestling-brain perspective, which is the \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d aspect Cena references in his promos. You are justifying your vitriol for The Bella Twins because they\u2019re a \u201cnostalgia run\u201d or they\u2019d be \u201cusurping the actual talent.\u201d But I\u2019d be willing to bet good money that if you went into a WWE women\u2019s locker room, almost everyone there would love to work with The Bellas; whether they grew up watching them, are just fans or friends of them generally, or whether they value the mainstream exposure the Bellas bring. \n\nPeople\u2019s humanity is bigger than the wrestling business. And put yourself in their shoes; it\u2019s easy to say these things on Reddit where everyone is effectively anonymous and we all assume the person we\u2019re speaking about will never see it. But what if Brie saw this thread? Literally all she did was suggest the idea of returning with Nikki and this thread is full of a \u201cdear god please no\u201d sentiment; can you genuinely imagine giving your life to an artform for years, all the travel and grueling training, just for that to be the response you get when nothing is even set in stone? \n\nThat\u2019s the kind of person you\u2019re choosing to be, the one who uses your wrestling fandom to tear down other people who aren\u2019t the wrestlers you want them to be. Cena was literally talking about you and you don\u2019t seem to get it",
