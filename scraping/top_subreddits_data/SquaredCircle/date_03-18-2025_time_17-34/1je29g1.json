Hadn't watched since like 2007 and then in 2019 I remember seeing ads for AEW and I was like holy crap a new wrestling company on this level already? When I finally tuned in the first thing I saw was Cody doing the moonsault off the cage. It reminded me of the higher risk matches of the Attitude Era and if anyone else remembers, as they transitioned to the next era, they toned their matches way down so it had been a minute since I saw anything like the cage moonsault. Couple weeks later I ordered the first Revolution and Hangman/Omega vs Bucks just hooked me right in and I've been on the bandwagon since. The pandemic shows were weird at first but after awhile, I dunno, it kinda felt like you were part of this awkward thing with no real audience. I thought the other wrestlers in the crowd was a nice touch. So that's right where I latched on with AEW and by the time they returned to regular shows it was kinda weird for me and took me a minute to adjust to \"normal\" again lol.",

In some ways, they even did a better job than WWE at the time - at least in the first few months before Roman started to use the silence creatively during matches. \n\nLike it was AEW that immediately worked out that pointing the camera at the entrance ramp was better than pointing it at the empty crowd. And it was AEW that started using wrestlers as a makeshift crowd to provide at least some atmosphere. \n\nI can\u2019t remember which company did a cinematic match first, maybe that was WWE, but I remember AEW did a really good job with Sting/Darby and Stadium Stampede, and matches like that. \n\nAEW really felt like a proper team effort back then, with everyone doing their bit. \n\nThe way they rode out the pandemic. The way they used Dark to give work to indie wrestlers who would be struggling otherwise. The way the locker room kept Brodie\u2019s illness a secret. The way guys like Eddie Kingston basically got given try outs on national TV and Cody went out of his way to make sure he looked great so he\u2019d get a job. \n\nIt just felt like such a united front and they could ride out anything. I still really enjoy AEW overall. But when people talk about \u201cthe feeling\u201d, I think that\u2019s the part that\u2019s gone away a little bit.
