When Edge cashed in and beat him the fans were thrilled because the non kids could see how Vince was treating him like old school Hogan. Cena was just booked to beat everyone all the time. Sure he would lose but not often and it completely deflated many potential stars who should\u2019ve gotten main event pushes to be considered the face of the promotion but it\u2019s was just years and years of Vince only letting Cena be THE top guy. It\u2019s why Edge, Orton, Punk and AJ always had fan support because sure John was the babyface but \u201cSuper Cena\u201d became boring after a few months.",

Hogan and Nash were close but a lot of their most egregious stuff happened before forums were really booming OR after WCW was already falling off the rails.\n\nAlthough I basically checked out of wrestling entirely for Cena's career, I basically only know him for being hated online because I still stuck around a lot of wrestling forums for the community aspect and to talk aboud the good old days.\n\nA key difference with Cena is he is a genuinely good person by all accounts and wrestling fans have aged.  A lot of the people who spent their formative years hating him online now probably have a newfound appreciation for him as a performer.",

Conversely, WWF is presented as being fair and having paid ECW in exchange for signing people away. \n\nWhat isn't covered much in Rise and Fall DVD is that WWF intentionally and deliberately raided ECW the second they got on national television. Within 3 weeks of ECW debuting on TNN, WWF signed away ECW's World Champion Taz and their tag team Champions the Dudley Boys. ECW had to scramble to switch the titles off them immediately. This, by intent, was to make ECW look small-time, amateur and a minor league. Heyman was very, very lucky that he was able to get Raven back from WCW just in time to switch the tag titles onto him and Dreamer right as the Dudleys were going so that the blow was somewhat softened. \n\nThink how much \"\"\"\"Discourse\"\"\"\" they would have been in 2019/2020 if within two months of AEW Dynamite starting, WWE was able to sign AEW World Champion Jericho and AEW Tag Champions SCU, or worse, Omega and Hangman. \n\nIf WWE signed Jericho, Omega and Hangman 2.5 months into AEW, the entire wrestling world have proclaimed AEW a dead promotion walking, it was the end, they doomed etc etc. 3 out of 4 champions gone within a few weeks. \n\nThat is what WWE did to ECW in 1999. It's not even a real topic on the Rise and Fall DVD, but is covered if I recall correctly in the \"Forever Hardcore\" DVD by Jeremy Borash that was made in response. \n\nThis is just one of many aspects of WWE twists about it's relationship with ECW. I could on about other things, but I'll leave it there for the moment.\n\nWhenever WWE talks about ECW, keep in mind that the main person who could defend ECW (Paul Heyman) can't speak out as he's on their payroll and needs to be on their good side.",

Therefore you could be better prepared for the online discussion that was running at the time. \n\nNowadays, you'd need to be a fairly big wrestling history nerd to watch it. Because WWE owns the ECW footage, the only wrestling footage Forever Hardcore could show was stuff like XPW, where a lot of former ECW guys ended up, and still photos. So most of the DVD is just talking heads speaking directly to the camera. That can be monotonous in 2025. \n\nYou'll hear things on the documentary that you wouldn't hear on a WWE one, such as Terry Taylor admitting WWE stole things from ECW. He admits when he booked Big Show chokeslammed Undertaker through the ring, he was ripping off Bam Bam Bigelow and Taz going through the ring in ECW. \n\nIf that sort of thing interests you, you could put it on. \n\nToday I'd say it would work better as a podcast series rather than as a video/DVD, but podcasts weren't really a thing at the time.",

It's quite possibly true, although these days I'm much more inclined to believe what D-Von says than Bubba. \n\nPaul Heyman rarely, if ever, discusses the end of ECW for a number of reasons. \nHowever, it was either Heyman or someone else from ECW's backstage who pointed out the following:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy 1999, the wrestling payscale has absolutely mushroomed from where it began at the start of the decade. With WWE and WWF raiding each other and paying \"over the top\" money for everyone, this pinched the smaller promotions. In 1999, ECW was paying Sandman, Raven, RVD, and Dreamer roughly $250,000 a year. That's a million dollars for 4 roster members alone. There were other \"big ticket\" items on ECW's roster in 1999 include Sunny, Mike Awesome, Sabu, Shane Douglas and of course Taz, as we've mentioned. \n\nKeep in mind that both Vince McMahon and Jim Ross were adamant as late as the late 2010s that no single wrestler, even top main eventers, should get over 1 million as base pay. Jim Ross wouldn't hire anyone from WCW unless they gave up their AOL contracts because he didn't want to \"blow up\" WWF/WWE's payscale. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo when Heyman told the Dudleys he couldn't give them a raise, it's not like he didn't want to, it's that he couldn't give them that without continuing to skyrocket ECW's pay scale. It was in this era that Heyman was trying to improve ECW's coffers by seeking to get Billy Corgan to invest in ECW. People thought it was a crazy idea at the time, but we know now in hindsight that Corgan was 100% interesting in wrestling but he couldn't distract from his muic at the time. Trivia note: Corgan did appear on ECW TV and smashed a guitar over someone's head. \n\nSo might be true the Dudleys would have stayed with a pay raise, but ECW felt they couldn't do it without blowing up the payscale and collasping the company.",

You really think those guys were main eventers?\n\nThis is the dumbest argument I have ever seen people make when considering how John Cena buried people during his time at the top. We will never know if those guys were worthy of the main event because they weren't even provided the opportunity to reach main event status while Cena was on top. I'm sure you hold the same argument about the Nexus and Bray as well...",

Orton literally punted the entire group out of existence by himself and then beat Punk clean as a whistle at Mania (amazing match btw) but no one ever says he buried any of them lol.\n\nBarrett improved a lot, Ryback had a nice wave, and of course Danielson is Danielson, but everyone else in that group was replaceable. Hell, I'd argue Husky getting punted then sent back to development was the best thing ever because it gave him a chance to create the Bray gimmick. \n\nThe Ryder stuff was a complete burial for sure but that was a Vince punishment, not like Cena wanted to do him like that. Ryder getting pushed face first off the stage in a wheelchair was worse than Cena kissing Eve imo lol.\n\nI kinda disagree about Bray. In the feud, Cena even said what made Bray dangerous is that he doesn't care if he wins or loses, he just wants to break Cena and cause chaos. Now, they definitely went kinda halfway with the Cena being tormented stuff but Bray got wins too. And fwiw, Bray got to squash Cena in a \"match\" at Mania.",

If Gunther was to bring up Super Cena as a booking decision, it'd be fair game for Cena to say the same about Gunther's record-breaking IC title run. Or giving Cody the championship at all.\n\n\nThere's a time and a place to break kayfabe but bringing up the real-life creative decision behind Super Cena would not be a good one regardless of the time or place.\u00a0",

That, combined with some of the IWC remaining as a vocal group complainant for so long, and Vince getting worse, led to Cena getting polarized reactions.\n\n\nAlso, Batista definitely had that exotic big wrestler look that appealed to fans in the US and outside at the time (I deadass see his pictures on a lot of the bodybuilding and health related stores in places of lower strata). That might be the aura, I guess.\n\n\nRing-wise, Batista and Cena were partly on the same level before the latter's open challenge renaissance.

Anyone that watched during them knew they were on the same level perception and reality.  WWE now tries to carry it like it was all Cena and no one else came close like he was Hogan or something.  And you stated the obvious.  Mania can only have one main event but that was a clear example of both matches being main event worthy not like the later years where the likes of Swagger and Del Rio in the opening match for the world title.  Cena didnt main event 21, 24, 25 or 26 what does that mean?",

I heard SD had better ratings when Heyman was booking/writing. They just called it A show for running longer more than anything.  SD champion actually closed PPV's back then not like mid card world champions that never got the main event.  Almost every top guy turned heel at some point they just refused with Cena when his heel turn should of happened the most due to mixed crowd reaction.",

But every year SD got screwed in the draft because they always wanted the biggest stars on Raw. The A show/B show thing was never a work. Raw was on network TV so it was in many more homes, while SmackDown was on cable. That's also why it was chosen to run for longer, it got better ad rates and more viewers.
