His problem is just that he's pushed way above his actual abilities, he didn't \"lost it\", he never had *it* to begin with. \n\nNo charisma, no personality, very bad at conveying emotions, basically feels like a robot trying to convince you he's human. No matter what gimmick they give him he still feels like a soulless, lame, manufactured poster boy that gets opportunities after opportunities just because Bushiroad wants him and no one else as the next Ace for some reason. \n\nHe's still one of the youngest heavyweights so they really don't need to rush anything with him. They should let him build himself in the lower/midcard for a year, get an actual midcard belt to work with and see if he can find something of his own to connect with the fans. For now he's a good hand in the midcard but he hasn't shown anything that suggests he could be a main event act on the longterm.",
