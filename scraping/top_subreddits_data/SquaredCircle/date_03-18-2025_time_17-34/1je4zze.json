He legit was pushed at that time as the next main guy, and then that Hogan program kinda killed any momentum he had.\n\nWhat is even worse, Sid had a major wrestling moment, kicking out of the leg drop, that everyone completely ignored cause Papa Shango was late on his run in. \n\nAt the time, Hogan/Sid made some sense, especially if they did it face vs face. But between the odd booking, the match seemingly being there to get the Warrior over, and the fact it main evented over a far superior championship match, really makes it one of the worst Mania matches for me.",

Malakai Black was one of the most well known ones because WWE legal screwed up his paperwork and they forgot to include the clause in it.  He checked with his lawyer and he was free and clear to get on AEW TV something like a week later after being released from WWE.",

The best part was that Orton was justified in his actions, since he had resentment towards HHH for betraying him and kicking him out of Evolution and taking his world heavyweight championship years prior. The buildup to the match was phenomenal. Then\u2026 the match came and they had the awful stipulation that if HHH was disqualified he\u2019d lose the title. Hell nah man this match should have been a street fight or something, a stipulation where they could demolish each other. And Orton should have won. He was far and away the best heel in the industry at the time. Having his crowning moment at mania would have cemented that. But no, they had a bad stipulation and it was a plodding 25 minute match with an anticlimactic finish.

The one-two combo of ending the streak at WrestleMania 30 and demolishing John Cena at SummerSlam 2014 made Brock Lesnar the de facto top act in the WWE and he stayed there until I'd say night 2 of WrestleMania 38. He would not have lasted eight years on top without the win against Taker at WrestleMania.\n\nIt's easy to say \"oh, they should have used ending the streak to elevate somebody\" and on paper that's right, but the problem with that is that WWE was the gang that couldn't shoot straight in the 2010s. Everything they touched turned to shit. If they had tried to elevate someone they would have screwed it up. We know this because they tried it with Roman Reigns beating the Undertaker at WrestleMania three years later and everyone hated it and it derailed Roman's ascendancy for damn near a decade. And that was *Roman*. Imagine how Bray Wyatt or Baron Corbin or Austin Theory ending the streak would have went.\n\nLesnar's run as a part time champion wasn't because they were in love with Brock Lesnar and wanted him to be the face of the company, it was because nothing else they tried worked, including Roman Reigns as top guy. They eventually righted that ship, but it took several years and in the interim Brock carried the weight, partially because he was a big scary motherfucker but also because he ended the Undertaker's streak",

Those moments were bad booking that hurt his mystique, but the character still had good moments afterward and was still booked strong. But this loss was all the nails in the coffin.\n\nFirst of all, the storytelling didn't make sense. The Fiend lost the inferno match, but coming back and getting revenge on Orton, a guy who he's had a long and personal history with, makes sense. It also played into the general tgene of the Fiend feuding with people he had history with. So him coming back and losing? It's bullshit.\n\nAlso, nobody gained from this angle. Bray was buried, sure, but giving his gimmick to Alexa? Nothing against her, but she couldn't carry that on her own. It felt forced. Orton didn't gain from it either. He didn't need that win, especially since he went on to work a comedy tag team story with Matt Riddle. Honestly, it might have made more sense for him to lose, and then Riddle would be there to perk him back up.\n\nFinally, the fans hated the finish. Even if you personally didn't like the Fiend or his stories or the matches, he was still popular. This was WWE's 2nd night of live shows following a year of pandemic shows, and they featured a beloved character getting buried? It was a huge middle finger to the people who were excited to see Bray, only for him to lose in an incredibly unsatisfying way.\n\nBasically, the whole thing reeked of Vince McMahon being tired of this character, even though he moved merch, and so he buried him, subsequently firing Bray months later. It really pissed me off as a fan, and I actually stopped watching after Bray was fired because I was so done at the time.",
