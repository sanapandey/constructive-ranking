Chasing after him would\u2019ve been more than enough to bring Jey back to Roman. \n\nIt would\u2019ve hit harder during the reunion if Jey was the only one with a singles title. They had 1 segment on SD where Roman was like \u201cgood job man\u201d then Jey lost it a few days later. \n\nThey really just speed ran that whole arc tbh. \n\nI thought the way they did the bloodline WarGames build was very rushed between Jey forgiving Roman & everybody else forgiving him too. \n\nI still haven\u2019t heard a good reason for why Sami forgave Roman.",

But if we're saying that War Games is where they have to link up, then they need Jey to be part of it. That's kinda the issue with having a a PLE named after a match type, you have to meet a deadline.\n\nI don't think they should have been on good terms at War Games cause Roman never even really apologized, but I'm just not sure why Jey would get involved without them getting in his business.",
