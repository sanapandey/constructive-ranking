Jey is just fine, can pull off a good match (especially with Gunther), and I do think he is a bit overhated on here, even with a bad night yesterday. \n\nYou have a guy that can talk in Gunther. You have a good who is pretty solid on the mic and acting in general with Jey, who is one of the biggest highlights of The Bloodline, besides Roman. \n\nYet every week, it\u2019s the same exact thing. Jey has a match. Gets beaten up by Gunther. Gunther beats up others. Gets beaten up by Jey.\n\nThere\u2019s a good story there with Jey never beating Gunther and you can have solid segments and promos about it, like they did in the first two weeks of Jey\u2019s Rumble win. But it\u2019s just the same thing every week and it doesn\u2019t even really get time.\n\nHow can a feud for the World Heavyweight Championship be this uninteresting when you got one of the most over wrestlers in the company and one of the best wrestlers in the world? Insane how a year ago, the World Champion was not just in one, but TWO super engaging feuds at WrestleMania.",

Last year, Bayley/Iyo was forgotten about for much of the build. You could argue that Cody/Roman worked, but it's also because the Rock inserted himself, messed everything up, and then there were 4 guys building to 2 matches, instead of a normal 1v1 build. And 2 of the guys in those matches were part-timers who didn't appear every week.\n\nI think you can make a build that long work under the right circumstances, but it seems like it's too long for most feuds.",

                            "body": "You know how wrestlers change their names when they change promotions? Wikipedia has rules about using the most common name. And there's never been a consensus about at what point someone's character name becomes their \"common name.\" So you get arguments about oh, he hasn't used the name long enough, or hasn't done anything notable under that name yet. If you're real \"lucky\" you can get some tribalistic bickering about whether a promotion itself is notable or not. This isn't even just between promotions either, you even get it within the same promotion. Big Bill's page had a discussion where people didn't wanna change his name to Big Cass, leaving it at Colin Cassidy. It finally got changed eight months later. It currently stands at W. Morissey because the Wikipedia folks decided that even after a couple years (and a tag title) that he's still more well known under that name than Big Bill. It's all very confusing and very stupid. I don't even DARE click the talk page for Adam \"The Cope\" Edgeland.\n\nDon't even start me on things like attendance figures in event pages. And this kind of pedantic bickering predates AEW by over a decade: there was once a MONTHS long discussion about whether Wrestlemania 25 should be called \"the 25th anniversary of Wrestlemania\" because even though it technically wasn't, it was also how the WWE billed it.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the period of time where it was mandated that all of the articles describe wrestling moves in an overly verbose fashion, thank god they moved on from that one.",

Morissey because the Wikipedia folks decided that even after a couple years (and a tag title) that he's still more well known under that name than Big Bill.\n\nThis is also straight up lunacy. Like I could at least vaguely understand if he was still listed as Big Cass, he was obviously a big deal under that name in WWE, but W. Morissey feels like the easy third choice (fourth if we include the option of his real name imo). Looking at Cagematch, I think he only ever wrestled 35 total matches as W. Morrissey - compared to currently 67 (and counting) as Big Bill and 220 (with a lot of those being house shows) as Big Cass. \n\nHell, I think Big Bill has been a super successful rebranding overall as it feels like everyone has just accepted it (on this sub). People chant it at shows, all of the online discussion uses it, etc.\n\nWikipedia editors on weird power trips though, it's a thing.",

Our enforcement currently is we're not going to delete posts directly from wrestlers' socials -- especially when a lot of that can tie into their gimmicks -- but the comments are likely gonna be trash so we'll lock the threads and move on.\n\nIt isn't like we're letting users post their own WrestleFap-esque still images, but maybe I've missed something.

Women are allowed to be sexy. What's NOT allowed is for people to be disgusting in the comments. Bans have been handed out up, down, and sideways in those threads. At this point it's kinda nice seeing them so we can hand out those bans and people learn that we're serious about them not being disgusting.\n\nLouder for those in the back: WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO BE SEXY. AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO IT WITHOUT GOONER COMMENTARY.\n\nAs for what gets removed as a \"double standard\" - that's simply not true. It's us mods needing to get on the same page after the town hall discussion thread, something we specifically brought up in that post to get your feedback. It's a known issue. At the same time, the feedback we've gotten from the community was similarly all over the map. It's never going to be a perfect system because it's inherently subjective - and there are days when news is heavy where we may remove more than others, or a really quiet day where we let more things rock.

In terms of functionality, we encourage people to post screenshots instead of direct links (although add a link in the comments if people want to verify it's not a fake). \n\nMost of the reason we didn't outright ban it at first was because (a) a LOT of clips are posted on the site, and there's more effort involved to re-host that vs. a screenshot, and (b) because WWE is tightly looped in with them for the Speed championship + it's the preferred social media platform for their roster. \n\nBut given time, we've seen a lot of people adapt to re-hosting the content and using screenshots more often than directly linking (or using different sources like Bluesky). Getting people into that habit was a big first step to see if it would even be feasible for us to ban it outright. So we're on our last round of discussions about it.",

I actually watched the movie after seeing people talk about the reference and I completely understand how the storyline is based on the movie (a crazy gang of hooligans who justify their gratuitous acts of violence as \"taking back their country\" when they're really just angry evil people) but it was a way more sensitive topic that was probably just the wrong movie to base a wrestling storyline off of. But despite the questioning of \"how could the same company who booked the Toni/Mariah feud book such a terrible main event scene\" it's pretty clear that RJ is heavily involved with both storylines, they just have very different source material.",

Not fantastic at wrestling, not an amazing promo, doesn\u2019t have a unique look nor an ultra impressive physique, doesn\u2019t connect with the audience, and there\u2019s really just nothing that stands out about him at all. There\u2019s just so many other people on the roster who are better at all of those aspects. Theory being a solid hand and a safe-worker who eats L\u2019s to bigger names is probably the best possible slot for him.",

I think his ringwork is good, not great, but definitely B-level. \n\nBut, they fucked up a lot of his booking and character, and putting him with Grayson Waller - who is better at literally everything - really puts a cap on him.

So I was like \"okay, what terrible booking did they do now\". Then what does it turn out to be? Rhea basically pulled a trope from the past of interrupting a contract signing and signing the contract as a wildcard move so to speak. It's one of those \"cool face\" moves that usually gets a pretty good (albeit finding it a bit funny at the silliness of pro wrestling) reception. And the crowd absolutely popped like a mfer for it here.\n\nSo the fact of Rhea - a storyline established desperate, insecure face, is added this triple threat LIKE EVERYONE EXPECTED HER TO BE, that apparently was enough cause for people go off on \"Rhea Hogan\", call her a karen, and all that shit (for example, Alfred Konuwa invoked **white privilege** to describe her in the segment, like wtf - and hundreds were agreeing with him). That was likely the worst amount of hatred I've seen for Ripley in the past weeks.\n\nI'm hoping one day that wrestling fans can be \\*normal\\* about women's wrestling, and stop holding disproportionately harsh standards for women's stuff compared to men's, stop hating it to death when there's a generationally over woman who's being booked as strong as she should be. There's a lot to improve, but women's wrestling discussion online across social media should not be so nitpickingly, \"i will criticize no matter what\" toxic and stan warfare/hatred heavy.",

And contrary to previous takes where people would justify their criticisms of say, Charlotte by saying that she didn't do the right things, she just relied on her surname (while with Cody that's totally fine cause gendered double standards and all), or even criticise Bianca for being purely PC-trained, Rhea had no wrestling background and made it all the way up from starting out in the Australian indies, even wrestling in Japan in the process. If even someone with the ideal background still gets this level of criticism online after making it big, it shows you the standards are different.\n\nIt's especially irksome when these same people were previously griping about Rhea being too strong and having no flaws and supposedly just cutting the one promo over and over. Now they're running a story where Rhea's actively adding nuances to her character, but still beloved by crowds, and even that gets overlooked because they're so angry at her coming out on top in a segment. Which is also leading to some odd takes demanding that she's doesn't wrestle at Mania at all, which is a strange 'punishment' that would actively detract from the match.",

Roman Reigns never apologising was much more blatant, and people do call it out, but they forgive it much more for rule of cool.

It's a huge can of worms and I doubt any of them care enough at this point, very hard for them to take a stance on anything, especially if they've been there a few years.",

That was the promise of NXT post black and gold, and I think they succeeded and made a very good program along the way. I have seen and followed this wrestlers for years now.\n\nBut now suddenly like 4 other women came from relatively out of nowhere and are put in all the relevant positions of the cards and given the belts. The ones that you have seen and got attached to during all this time? Sorry, go the back of the line, the people we actually cared about are here now. Good luck if you get a 2 min segment, otherwise you are out of TV for months.\n\nReminds a bit of KO and Jericho getting pushed down the card and stripped of the feud for the top belt when Goldberg and the big boys came back for WM season.

The Moxley reign is meant to be a dominant heel faction reign of terror and the whole point of those is that every babyface facing them should have the crowd going nuts for them because they're desperate to see these guys lose - that's exactly where we are lol, it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.\n\nI just think it's more likely to continue because there is still a lot of story \"juice\" left to address/happen. I think Danielson returns before this whole thing ends, we've had Ospreay tease wanting to be \"the guy,\" and I think Darby plays a role too (maybe even ends up being the one to end it). Danielson/Darby were both all over the video packages at Revolution from what I remember, so they haven't been put on the back burner, they're still presented as part of this.\n\nNot to mention ending a lengthy heel reign of hell a few months before the biggest show of the year just feels like a huge error. Nobody would ever expect WWE to book a reign like this and end it right before Wrestlemania (nor should they).",

Jey has a fun entrance every week but that's about it. And Gunther feels less important than he's ever been in his entire run in the main roster. Tiffany and Charlotte aren't being given anything that really sells this match. The biggest thing from this feud was Stratton throwing shade on twitter.\n\nIyo/Bianca/Rhea are doing their best but aside from Rhea never beating Iyo, the dynamics don't feel like they have much weight to them. On paper it seems the obvious move is that Iyo is being treated like the underdog to pull off an upset win. But the past two weeks all I can think about is how much she's being treated like a chump immediately after winning the title.\n\nReigns/Rollins/Punk I'm sure will have a solid build the next few weeks. And Cena's promo last night maybe not have been the best, but neither was The Rock's first heel segment last year. So I'm certain he'll have the time to flesh it out better.

Great stuff, loved the promo on first viewing, but.......\n\n......Who, exactly, are the first two people he fled to to get out of this abusive relationship?\n\nOh yeah, The Rock and Travis Scott.\n\nHoly fuck John, your decision making is terrible.",

But man it really sucks that two of the biggest duds on the show are big stables that take up semi-significant amounts of the narrative\n   \nI'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt to Temu Retribution, but debuting like a Temu Retribution certainly isn't a good start. Like, if you're trying to make these guys a threat, have them do more than some mild vandalism and attacking one guy every few weeks. Who are these people? Why are they doing this? More importantly, why should we care? They're not causing mass destruction or putting the state of the show in jeopardy, they're just...there. Again, I won't write them off because they're relatively new, but it's not been a great start. \n   \n...Though, they're at least salvageable. But holy shit Shawn Spears' stable is possibly the most boring thing in WWE on a weekly basis. Spears himself is okay, I still don't see why he needs a title in the year 2025 even if it is a transitional reign, but man the rest of the stable is just bleh. Brooks Jensen is possibly the most repulsively uninteresting wrestler I've ever seen, and I've seen NXT Karrion Kross. Niko Vance is like... there, I guess? He just kinda showed up one day and nobody decided to elaborate. Izzi Dame is alright I guess, I don't see too much in her but she's got a high floor and has at least given the group some life beyond \"I'm Shawn Spears and I have a faction now\"\n   \nBut besides that, and the fact that I still have to see Nikkita Lyons wrestle sometimes, NXT is knocking it out of the park as usual. If you're not watching it, watch it. HBK is a booking wizard and has made excellence while having arguably less to work with than other bookers\u2014which is why I'm also holding my breath that Temu Retribution can still turn it around with time",

Something will be used for the RAW and Smackdown episodes instead, something might be meshed together in one story.\n\nHere are my ideas on how things may go:\n\nI expect none of the men's tag titles to be defended on the show. Now, the SD titles have the bigger stories, but I feel they might be used for a SD main event. New Day getting the RAW titles on Wrestlemania could make sense as a big heel moment.\n\nFor the women, I think one of the midcard titles might be defended on the show, but it's not a given. Having to choose, I think Lyra might defend in a multi-women program, also involving the likes of Bayley and Perez. Chelsea might have some funny segments, but I don't expect her feud with Vega to make it to Mania.\n\nI expect the women's tag titles to be on the show, either defended or as part of a bigger story. They still have not really created any credible challenger for them, though, so that makes it more difficult. I thought it would be Sky and Dakota, that obviously is not happening now. Unless Kairi returns in time, they might have to do a random multi-women match where JD retain.\n\nBecky's return is probably either postponed to the RAW after Mania, or it will happen at Mania itself.\n\nI expect both men's midcard titles to be on the show. Fatu might end up challenging Knight. For the IC title it is either Bron vs Penta, or a multi-man affair.\n\nPass for the Wyatts. Judgment Day drama will probably be reserved for the weekly shows. Nothing with LWO and American Made either.\n\nA possible card would be:\n\nNight 1\n\n1) Jey Uso vs Gunther\n2) Liv Morgan & Raquel Rodriguez (with Dirty Dom) vs Baszler & Stark vs Jax & LeRae vs Niven & Fyre (with Chelsea) vs...\n3) AJ Styles vs Logan Paul\n4) Naomi vs Jade Cargill\n5) LA Knight vs Jacob Fatu\n6) IYO SKY vs Bianca Belair vs Rhea Ripley\n7) CM Punk vs Roman Reigns vs Seth Rollins\n\nNight 2\n\n1) Bron Breakker vs Penta\n2) Lyra Valkyria vs Bayley vs Roxanne Perez\n3) The New Day vs The War Raiders\n4) Drew McIntyre vs Damian Priest\n5) Randy Orton vs Kevin Owens\n6) Charlotte Flair vs Tiffany Stratton \n7) Cody Rhodes vs John Cena\n\nWhat do you think? What will be different? Do you enjoy the card as it is?",

It makes more sense for the belts with the 5 month feud and visibility to make Mania than the belts creative forgets about and would have to throw together a feud in the final few weeks.\n\nOf course there's a chance neither tag belts makes Mania which would be a shame given all the work the SD teams have put into it this year and it'd mean that Rumble match will be the only men's tag title PLE match since the belts split last Mania.",
