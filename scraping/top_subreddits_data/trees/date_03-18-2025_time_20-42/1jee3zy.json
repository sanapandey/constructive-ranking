Tbh I think this is all bullshit but let's hit and see\n\nDo y'all like weed to be squishy or a lil crunchy? Lmk\nFirst hit: got damn heavy ASF on my lungs. Taste like... I actually don't know. I had one job and failed at it. Welp, it got me goofy\ud83d\ude1d. Life look so much more beautiful. Also that got me preeety smacked so hopefully I make it to the end of this review \n\nSecond hit: ",

I put the dry stuff in a dynavap, makes cleaning easier.",
