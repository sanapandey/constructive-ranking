    "selftext": "If you are ever visiting Canada or better yet live here, I can't recommend enough giving this flower a try. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for. Been smoking 10+ years and have tried many legal offerings here, but this is the creme of the crop IMO. Third half bag I've purchased, and the consistency is on point each time. Its not the best most exotic looking bud ive ever seen, but still some nice medium sized nugs caked in trichomes. And one thing ive learned over the years is looks arent everything! This shit absolutely reeks, the terps are loud as fuck nothing too exotic smelling but pure STANK. It really is like permanent marker. Pics don't do em justice with a shit camera but the nugs are that perfect mix of dense and fluffy. Super sticky I mean usually i don't get those gluey resin coated fingers until i break the bud down with my hands, but even just lightly handling these nugs I had to wash them after. Breaks down well in the grinder, nice kinetic sand feel. Smell comes out even more once busted, nice and clumpy. Most stoners probly know this but poke around your weed after it's grinded with ur finger a lil, and if it's \"dancing\" and kinda bouncin around after touchin it you know you got some ripe bud! Dry weed don't dance, and this shit is always dancing.\nPerfect for rolling, however I usually just smoke bowls. Burns amazing, perfect white ash, also real heavy hitter in the bong, even the 4th bowl of the day gets me ripped like it's the 1st. Taste really comes through aswell, specifically the Jealousy. Definitely a legit 30% THC unlike some other Canadian LPs that inflate their numbers, this shit is fr potent. Terms too. I also don't seem to get strain fatigue from it unlike a lot of other good strains ive smoked. Very indica leaning hybrid, great for nighttime but also daytime cuz it's not overly couch locking. When i took a small t break and then smoked this, I damn near greened out off two rips I mean this is definitely not for beginner tokers. \nMan this is getting so long you'd think I'm shilling for northerncanna lol but I really just love this strain! and Northerncanna clearly knows how to grow good weed. Haven't tried their other strains but I'm sure they're fire. Anyway cheers to everyone and I am smoking this bowl rn for anybody that lives in cannabis prohibited areas, whether in some states or other countries, I hope one day this gas we're  blessed with is available to everyone freely! \ud83d\ude4f\nPeace from Canada",
