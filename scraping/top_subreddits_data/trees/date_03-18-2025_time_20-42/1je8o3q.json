She gave me like 4 oz of the sticky stuff, I gave her help to repair her shed. God, it was amazing, best high I ever got from weed, maybe cause it was grown with love from a lifelong gardener. I still remember the taste and how smooth it was even if she barely trimmed it. I didn\u2019t trimmed it either out of respect and cause I couldn\u2019t see any difference, it was still smoother than everything I got from the dispensary.",

Well grown outdoor indicas, even when not trimmed well, can blow your fucking socks off dude. \n\nYou, on the other hand, are a victim of predatory cannabis marketing. You know, the kind written by marketing majors who smoke distillate carts on the weekend to \u201cget lit\u201d. \n\nJust in case you haven\u2019t gotten the point, let me be absolutely clear: *You cannot judge the potency, taste, smell, or pretty much anything else in cannabis from a picture alone*. Is this stuff marketable? Probably not. But cannabis smoking came hundreds if not thousands of years before there even was a \u201cmarket\u201d. You seriously lack perspective and any kind of historical insight.",

Maybe op should've posted a picture of a nug but from what I see that looks like some meh ass weed and I believe we see it clearly enough to know what it is. I'm not sure where you're from or what quality you've actually been around or smoked but you believe that has the potential of hitting like some real cali weed.
