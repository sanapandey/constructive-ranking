            "body": "The most important thing you can do while taking edibles IMO (other than dosing right) is to ensure you eat fat with them. A spoonful of peanut butter is perfect bc it\u2019s super dense in fats but anything with a decent amount of fat will do. Cannabinoids bind to fat in your stomach to ensure that it will hit. If there\u2019s no fats to bind to, you\u2019ll get a mid high. It will make them hit harder so don\u2019t go overboard on the dose.",

THC is processed through the liver when eaten, so it takes a little longer to enter your bloodstream. Having something fatty can help speed it up (that's why we like chocolate edibles). \n\n5 to 10 mg is usually a good starting dosage for most folks.\n\nIf you get too stoned, drink something sweet like juice (the sweeter the better) and talk a walk outside for a few minutes or more. The change in environment & fresh air can be instrumental in grounding your head. A couple deep cleansing breaths can't hurt either.\n\nHave a great time!",
