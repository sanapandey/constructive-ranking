Then his whole career fell off (I think the front fell off) and now he's clawing for *this* type of attention?\nYuckyyyyy\nI really hope he keeps his antisemitism to himself from now on because I don't want to lose This Just Got Weird over their associations with him too. I already lost Wine About It because I can't support QT Cinderella as long as she keeps being roped into Fear& ... which sucks because I'd love to support Maya.",
