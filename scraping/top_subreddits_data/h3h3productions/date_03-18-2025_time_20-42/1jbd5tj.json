From memory, he said 'no one else is doing content like Ethan and Hila'. I checked it out, and 7 years later, I am here.\n\nEdit: I had to check my memory on this one - spoiler, my memory of this was not so great \ud83d\ude05 - and find the clip. \n\nCrazy that this stuck with me so much, because it was brief.

I'm a Jewish student and when my school had an encampment for solidarity with Gaza, there were many jews that I met at the protest. It was a very welcoming multicultural space where we all talked about what respecting each-other as different communities means in an activist spaces. I've been involved with Jewish Voice for Peace since, and it's been a way to build Jewish community in a time where our communities are so fractured and hurt. I understand Ethan's points about some people taking things too far and excusing things they shouldn't, but I think he's misled in painting with such a broad brush. My experience with Jewish Voice for Peace has been positive and I hope Ethan looks into it more. peace and love \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n(also want to note that I met Israeli members of Jewish Voice for Peace at the protest as well, and everyone was very respectful of them and grateful that they were there supporting the protest for a ceasefire)",

He was just making fun of the Turkish commenter in Ukraine for being horny essentially. I was talking to the Turkish person about this and after some discussion they felt that having a Turkish speaker translate might provide more insight to this clip than using something like chatGPT or google translate. They were telling me they were disappointed they used this clip because they felt it wasn\u2019t a good criticism of Hasan and there are many more clips they could use to criticize him better. \nAlthough I definitely DO NOT condone anything he said in this clip, I think maybe this wasn\u2019t a good clip to use to criticize hasan if we look at this from a native Turkish speaker. I definitely love war zone don\u2019t get me wrong I just think we should be more careful about the clip selections. \u270c\ud83c\udffc&\u2764\ufe0f",

I was confused, I thought you thought Galia\u2019s translation was off and we\u2019re offering this as an alternative. \n\nI disagree quite strongly with your overall sentiment about the comment. I think Galia felt very strongly about it, too; it\u2019s easy if you aren\u2019t Ukrainian but Galia is, I feel like this instance of sexism is just as worthy of criticism as all the other examples. That\u2019s my take anyway, agree to disagree. Maybe I\u2019m biased because I taught at a school with a few female Ukrainian children and I know of this disgusting stereotype and to think that Ukrainian women are sexualised, and someone who acts all high and mighty like Hasan are doing it on auto as if it\u2019s normal and instinctive. Yeah I don\u2019t get why you don\u2019t want anyone to focus on it? It might not matter to you but it matters to others and they\u2019re allowed to discuss it even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s important",

If one is only ever familiar with him from his role in the GMM Crew, this is all you would know.\u00a0\n\nSo it feels ironic and particularly foul that a guy with a brand image like that is actively supporting these egregious actions and people trying to harm Ethan and Hila\u2019s family. Ideally, one would hope that someone with a family and children of their own would hold empathy for what they are seeing Ethan and Hila go through and use whatever platform they have to flat out disavow it.\u00a0\n\nMythical is one of the largest independent digital media companies. Rhett and Link have been at the top of industry lists, on the covers, and members of panels for Variety, Time Magazine, and The Hollywood Reporter all just last year. And the Mythical Crew is as vital to the brand as Rhett and Link are (just like the H3 Crew to E&H) - they are highlighted in every episode and now with a dedicated crew show on Saturdays.\u00a0\n\nAll this to say, that I completely agree with Ethan and Hila, Rhett and Link wouldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t stand for anyone who supports what\u2019s happening to the Klein family and their children.\u00a0No one deserves this fear and anxiety and harassment and pain, especially not their precious boys.\u00a0",
