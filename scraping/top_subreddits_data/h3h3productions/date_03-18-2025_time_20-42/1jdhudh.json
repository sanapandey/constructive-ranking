What I was mainly referring to is just all the random people's heads that will inevitably be looking at this hilarious abomination pull into the studio lot or see it parked somewhere. Also, I dont know what it's like to be a public figure whatsoever. Plus, the crew probably already thought of all this, so there's nothing to worry about\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Wouldn't the wrap on Love's car dox Love's house (parking garage at least), and work?\n\nI hate to point this out. Maybe they explained there is a reason it wouldnt and I missed it. It also seems like all the unique choices would have the same effect, not just the 'fat love' wrap.\n\nAlso, I supposed any time someone drives somewhere this could happen, so maybe its not a concern at all",
