Also, this is one of the classic stages of Hasans little system, he's doing the label the other person obsessed when they respond to him, this is the N stage of the system. It's sort of hilarious in a sickening sort of way that Hasan employees the same tactics against people that he has done against people like Destiny, LonerBox and whoever he doesn't like to such an extent that people have created a system to track precisely what he is doing at a given time.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/s/Uy0qARaekU",
