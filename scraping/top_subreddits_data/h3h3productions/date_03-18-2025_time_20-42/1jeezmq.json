I can assume he will prob try to \u201ccrowder\u201d Ethan with BE, but still might be interesting. Would like to see this guy show his true colors when he\u2019s actually face to face with someone he ideologically disagrees with, and would love to see them talk about the CPS call too, and Matt\u2019s comments on it all.
