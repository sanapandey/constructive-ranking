To the point where if you google \u201cyoutube gifted memberships go to most engagement\u201d it shows a bunch of random sources that say that\u2019s how it works like https://www.hollyland.com/blog/tips/gift-membership-youtube#:~:text=YouTube\u2019s%20system%20of%20distributing%20gift,chance%20of%20receiving%20gift%20memberships.\n\nMaybe it is random now and used to be different. Maybe it has always been random. Maybe YouTube says it is random because that is easier to explain\n\nMany people also don\u2019t get gifted memberships because to my knowledge it is also opt in or at least used to be",

I imagine it's gotta feel like a job at some point. \nLike so many of those alpha morons make videos talking about how you shouldn't drink water a certain way or not allow your \"woman\" to post certain things online. They are CONSTANTLY thinking about what other [men] think of them.  They're so straight that they think about men more than gay dudes. \n\nOr maybe! They're hiding who they are.",
