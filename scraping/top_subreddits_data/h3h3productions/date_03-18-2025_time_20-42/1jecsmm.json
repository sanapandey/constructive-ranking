They either don't realise it or don't care, but that's the issue and the sources of a pipeline to antisemitic beliefs, dehumanising Israelis to a simple hive mind controlled or in support of Netanyahu, symbolised by the Star of David, with complete removal of nuance. This is what Ethan wanted to show in Israel, to unshackle that association and show that there are people who don't support this, that there is nuance here, but the antisemitic cabal can't allow that and labelled it tacit support for what the Israeli regime is doing in Gaza and propaganda. \n\nThey don't want nuance, they enjoy basking in their antisemitism using the lives of Palestinians as a shield from critism, it is disgusting.",
