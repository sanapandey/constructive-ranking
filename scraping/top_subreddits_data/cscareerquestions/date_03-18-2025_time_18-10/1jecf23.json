    "selftext": "So I recently got an offer at Microsoft for an SDE II job. I didn\u2019t think I would get it since I only  have 1.5 YoE, so I\u2019m pretty surprised.\n\nEven more surprising, they placed me at level 62  (SDE II consist of levels 61-62).\n\nNow I\u2019m worried that I was over leveled, and won\u2019t be able to meet their expectations given my limited experience. I\u2019ve looked up other people at this level, and a lot of them have 5+ years of experience\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or similar experience to this? This is like one of my dream jobs and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to screw it up now\n\n",

            "body": "I worked for microsoft as an SWE II as well. \n\nI dont know what project you work for but I worked at one of the Azure projects. Please dont be scared by anything I say as just because I experienced this does not mean you will. \n\nFirt off I will say Azure (cloud in general) is known where work/life balance goes to die. So if you dont work for Azure than you may have a better experience than I did as Ive always heard Microsoft is one of the FAANG places that has good work/life balance which is a big reason I applied there.\n\nWhere I worked was very 24/7. Work was non-stop, Principals and above were working late hours and even on weekends and it was very much that the work didnt end. Expecationations were high and it's kind of expected you are an innovative person. They prmote work/life balacne but there is a \"wink-wink\" work extra vibe to it. It's all about getting work done even if it takes you 80 hours every week to do it. You will be coompenstated very nicely if you get your work done during reviews and bonuses. Basically you had to work like you were a level above. So as an SWEII you should be working likey ou are a senior. They will never literally tell you to work more but they will throw hints.\n\nIt is very much work above everything in a lot of cases. Days are filled with meetings so you really cant fit coding, meetings, etc to a 8 hour day. Dont do what you are asked, do extra. See something in the code that could need improving? Bring it up. I quickly realized I was a 9-5 guy there and just wanted to do what I was given for the most part. That does not fly there. Everything is documented and you are expected to read everybody's documents (or most people's). DOnt be passive, they notice. At every scrum, make it seem like you are eager to learn. Ask the seniors/principals questions. Bring things up during scrum. Work with them outside of scrum. Make your name known. \n\nI had come from a more chill company that had low expecations and I didnt realzie how different it would be at Microsoft and it was a culture shock to me. You really have to loe what you are doing to be there (at least in Azure). \n\nAgain this is Azure so if you are elsewhere it could be different or more chill. But my recomendation would be to make yourself seen quickly. Try to own something within the first 6 months. Dont be passive. I was passive iand it burned me. Let me know if you have any questions. \n\nYou can do it and the experience shouldnt matter really and they will be considerate to it but you may need to work hard to get there.",

Most people on my team do their 9-5 and log off, aside from principals and (some) seniors depending on the day.  I'm only online after my 10-6 if I got super distracted in the middle of the day, and we don't have too many meetings.  I agree with all of the advice you've given in the context of how to get promoted, though.",

Like if you can get work done it wasnt like you needed to work 10+ hours everyday. \n\nBut more like you had to make the extra effort if needbe.",
