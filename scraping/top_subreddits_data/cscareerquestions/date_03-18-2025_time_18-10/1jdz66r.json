Thanks!\n\nThis thread is for sharing recent new grad offers you've gotten or current         The young'ins had their chance, now it's time for us geezers to shine! This thread is for sharing recent offers/current salaries for professionals with **2 or more years of experience**.\n\nPlease only post an offer if you're including hard numbers, but feel free to use a throwaway account if you're concerned about anonymity. You can also genericize some of your answers (e.g. \"Biotech company\" or \"Hideously Overvalued Unicorn\"), or add fields if you feel something is particularly relevant.\n\n* Education:\n* Prior Experience:\n    * $Internship\n    * $RealJob\n* Company/Industry:\n* Title:\n* Tenure length:\n* Location: \n* Salary: \n* Relocation/Signing Bonus:\n* Stock and/or recurring bonuses:\n* Total comp:\n        \nNote that you only really need to include the relocation/signing bonus into the total comp if it was a recent thing. Also, while the primary purpose of these threads is obviously to share compensation info, discussion is also encouraged.\n\nThe format here is slightly unusual, so **please make sure to post under the appropriate top-level thread**, which are: US [High/Medium/Low] CoL, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Aus/NZ, Canada, Asia, or Other.\n\n**If you don't work in the US, you can ignore the rest of this post.** To determine cost of living buckets, I used this site: http://www.bestplaces.net/\n\nIf the principal city of your metro is not in the reference list below, go to bestplaces, type in the name of the principal city (or city where you work in if there's no such thing), and then click \"Cost of Living\" in the left sidebar. The buckets are based on the Overall number: [Low: < 100], [Medium: >= 100, < 150], [High: >= 150]. (last updated Dec. 2019)\n        \nHigh CoL: NYC, LA, DC, SF Bay Area, Seattle, Boston, San Diego\n        \nMedium CoL: Orlando, Tampa, Philadelphia, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Riverside, Minneapolis, Denver, Portland, Sacramento, Las Vegas, Austin, Raleigh\n\nLow CoL: Houston, Detroit, St. Louis, Baltimore, Charlotte, San Antonio, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Kansas City",
