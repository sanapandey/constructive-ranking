Like WAY out of your league. \n\nYou worked with a FAANG for 2 years on an APPRENTICESHIP program straight out of high school. You might've done super well there but here's the thing. \n\nYou have 2 years of experience applying to jobs that require a MINIMUM of 7 years of experience. \n\nYou're 20-22 with no college degree when most your peers already have one or are in progress getting one. \n\nYou're applying to jobs and skipping way too many steps. \n\nGet a college degree, get an ENTRY-LEVEL position, work there a few years, and THEN start trying for those jobs you described. \n\nI'm honestly SHOCKED JPM even entertained an interview with you. Seems like they wanted to rule out the possibility you were a Coding Savant or something.",

At your current level of experience, those are the biggest sign of your ability that you have, and I'd like to see more details on what the projects did and what you accomplished.  If there are common languages/frameworks you see a lot at places you're applying to that you don't have experience in, this can be a good opportunity to show you can work in those technologies.  \nMore visibility into your projects too can be nice.  You may have removed that in obfuscation, but a way to see the gameplay for your game or a link to click around on your personal site would be a nice touch to let people really see something you've built.\n\n\n-I feel like this second role you have after your apprenticeship might be doing you more harm than good.  It makes me wonder why you couldn't hold that position for longer than a couple of months.  Unless you have good reason for that you can add in to the description, I think I'd try removing that position entirely and letting your Google experience and projects do the heavy lifting for you.",

It's way easier to land an internship or an entry level full time job if you're still a college student as you have access to exclusive career fairs and many companies have yearly quotas for their college recruiting. If you go back to school, you could also try to work on a research project with one of your professors, it's great for your resume and you may be able to get paid to do it.
