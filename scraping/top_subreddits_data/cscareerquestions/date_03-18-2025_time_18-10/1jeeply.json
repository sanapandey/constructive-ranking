    "selftext": "Does anyone know if the interview process for a front end position is different from full-stack/back end positions?\n\nI went through the loop last year for a full-stack position that had duties that were pretty back-end leaning. The process was :  \n\\- Code Signal Asessment\n\n\\- Power Day of 4 interviews (Coding, Case Study with coding, System Design, Behavioral).\n\n  \nWill the power day be the same for a Senior Front End Engineer role? When I did it last yer, the System Design portion specifically was pretty focused on back-end architecture so I can't imagine it would be similar for a front-end role.\n\nAnybody gone through this process or currently work there?",
