Quite often (though less than it used to be) that includes ~10 hours of diligent work in office. \n\nPart of what helps (if you consider this a desirable skill) is to be in a high stakes/pressure but well structured environment. I work a lot because what I do has a lot of immediate impact at my company. I can\u2019t hide because the stuff I do has very real world deadlines and consequences. I don\u2019t burn out cuz I get an immediate return on my effort and energy though. The demands are high but I also enjoy actually having an impact. \n\nIf you work in an environment where you can easily push back deadlines or \u201chide\u201d in some other way then you will probably train yourself to take as much slack as you can get away with. \n\nThe biggest benefit to developing some endurance here is that I waste less of my personal time now.
