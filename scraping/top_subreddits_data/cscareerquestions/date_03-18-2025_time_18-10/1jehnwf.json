    "selftext": "I've been working in proprietary SaaS tech support for 3 years and am now looking to transition into a cloud-adjacent role. To gain hands-on experience, I\u2019m currently building an Azure project to prototype a real-world solution. My background is fairly basic, I passed the AZ-900 and have very basic Python knowledge from 5 years ago.\n\nTo build this project, I've been using ChatGPT. I rely on it for Python scripts and guidance on setting up Azure resources, but I make sure to ask for detailed, line-by-line explanations of the code and instructions to fully understand why each step is necessary and I document it in the md files. I also cross-reference official Azure and Python documentation, though they can be complex to grasp at times.\n\nThis method has helped me learn a lot, but I\u2019m concerned about how it might be perceived in an interview. Would hiring managers see this as a legitimate way to gain hands-on experience, or does it come off as a shortcut rather than real learning? Would you be transparent about it in interviews (if I land any ofc)?\n\nI\u2019m also unsure what other beginner-friendly approaches I could take to build Azure projects that would better prepare me for applying to roles. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTLDR: I'm transitioning from SaaS tech support to a cloud role, using ChatGPT to build an Azure project while ensuring I understand each step. Is this a valid way to learn, or does it seem like a shortcut? Any beginner-friendly project advice?",

Which is very similar to coming across a stackoverflow solutions that was written 5 years ago.\n\nBasically, you should do your due diligence to understand what the AI is coding for you",

I do understand the code now, but I still feel like I shouldn\u2019t exaggerate my skills. What do you think?",
