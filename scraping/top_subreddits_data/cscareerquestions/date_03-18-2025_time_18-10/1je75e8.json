    "selftext": "I have 8 years experience as an analyst at a software company. I\u2019m currently a Sr. Analyst with a MBA and an unrelated undergrad degree. I\u2019m currently making ~$170k but this includes about 40k in RSUs that expire in a year. Half my team was laid off last year & I was moved to another team doing different work. I\u2019ve been looking for a new job but haven\u2019t had any success in the last 3 months. To me the writing is on the walls & I really want to arm myself so that I\u2019m able to maintain/increase my salary & be more technical so that I have more career flexibility & options. I want to be able to pivot to data engineering/data science but all the job req I see require CS degrees. My current stack is just SQL & some Python. My job would contribute up to 8k /yr for tuition. Would this make sense to do for someone in my position? ",

They\u2019re now doing non-technical work within the company",

I applied for jobs the year before last & the previous year but always decided to stop looking because my current job kept offering RSU & raises so jumping for more money didn\u2019t make sense. I would most likely go for CS or Data Science. Maybe a concentration in DS or Ai/Machine Learning. Not sure yet as I haven\u2019t done a ton of research yet.",
