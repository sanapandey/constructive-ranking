    "selftext": "Have been coding since 2013. What I noticed for the past 5-7 years is that most of programmers jobs become just an utter crap. It's become more about adhering to a company's customised processes and politics than digging deeper into technical problems.\n\nAbout a month ago I accepted an offer for a mid level engineer hoping to avoid all those administrative crap and concentrate on writing actual code. And guess what. I still spend time in those countless meetings discussing what backend we need to add those buttons on the front end for 100 times. The worst thing is even though this is a medium sized company, PO applies insane micromanagement in terms of \"how to do\", not \"what to do\". \n\nI remember about 5-7 years ago when working as a mid level engineer I spent a lot of time researching how things work. Like what are the limitations of the JVM concurrency primitives, what is the average latency of hash index scan in Postgres for our workload and other cool stuff. I still use as highlights in my resume.\n\nWhat I see know Software Engineer is better to be renamed to Politics Talk Engineer. Ridiculous.",

Yes software devs can spend all their time heads down coding but even in healthy companies, impact (= more $ in your pocket) comes from communicating and convincing people. Not saying OP\u2019s company is necessarily healthy but if OP\u2019s idea of the job is that meetings to discuss tech are \u201cpolitical BS\u201d then they\u2019re in for a rude awakening",

Just difficult choices that become poor in hindsight over the years.\n\nThing is, if you're willing to make the change, to take that jump, opportunities are out there.
