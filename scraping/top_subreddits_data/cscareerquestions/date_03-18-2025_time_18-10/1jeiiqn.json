    "selftext": "Got and accepted a shitty/low offer through 3rd party recruiter for a company that is known to hire non-PhDs (me) as contractors with no deadline for FT conversion. Fortunately, got a better offer shortly after. \n\nRecruiter experience was subpar but I did really jive with the hiring manager. It's just that business hiring practices suck, my resume was even deliberately parsed down by the recuiter, wiping a chunk of my professional accomplishments and promotions, I hate that what was supposed to be part of my salary went to someone else. Obviously reneging the offer through the recruiter is the necessary route but would it be too much to also send a note to the hiring manager apologizing for my change of heart? Or would they not want to hear it/am I being naive.\n\n",
