    "selftext": "I have interviewed a number of people lately that are clearly using AI to answer my questions.   Both the knowledge check questions and the coding questions. In some cases it's incredibly obvious. In other cases it's more subtle and hard to really say for sure.\n\nWhat is the solution here? How is it possible to interview someone remotely in 2025 and know they are not cheating?\n\nOn the other side is it possible to interview for a position without using AI and not be at a significant disadvantage?\n\nIs interviewing in 2025 really just about who can use AI the most discretely and effectively?",
