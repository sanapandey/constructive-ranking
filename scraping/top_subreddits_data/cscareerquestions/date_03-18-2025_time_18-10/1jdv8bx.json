    "selftext": "I'm a Computer Engineering grad, graduated in 2023. My colleagues got jobs back then but I had obligatory military service and just finished in 3 months ago.\n\nI have applied to countless amount of jobs, all of them are entry level or require > 2 experience (more on that at the end).\n\nI'm getting either one of the following:\n\n1- No response at all.\n\n2- \"Unfortunately, we decided not to move forward with your application\".\n\n3- I get a coding challenge, I pass it, then I get no response or rejection.\n\n\nAnd, for the rejections, I haven't got a single feedback on the rejection reason.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the job postings I see are either seniors or unpaid internships at startup companies with 2-4 employees (sometimes they will pay for full-time jobs, but about half the price of the market prices that I may herd cattle instead). Few junior positions I see and that's the ones I apply for, only to find out every listing has +200 application at the very minimum, and about 15-25% of them are seniors applying for junior positions (stat shown by LinkedIn premium).\n\n\nI apply for entry/junior web positions (full stack, backend, or frontend), and I have experience on some certain full stack languages/frameworks but that's only coming from my personal projects, since I can't get a real job that will count as work experience. I do get the job done, and made some few gigs on freelancing before, but never worked under a senior before within a \"company\".\n\n\nI have been seriously thinking about shifting careers. I honestly don't know what to do at this stage. \nI keep thinking that I should dive deeper and learn more languages/frameworks, but then I see most job postings require minimum +5 years experience and the problem is not about languages or frameworks rather experience and there is a great chance that I'd be just wasting time. If I shift career, I honestly regret the amount of effort and time I have wasted on getting my degree. Why this is a lose-lose situation?",

It's an important time to be creative right now.\n\nEdit: Also, my dude, your passion can be art but you can have more than one passion. I would recommend getting passionate about coding if you want to make a living off of it. It won't be the same passion but you can't make it for long enough if you convince yourself you're not doing something you aren't interested/fascinated by. Try not to box in your passion, find passion in \"craft\" because software is not devoid of art if you think imaginative.",

On paper, it looks like you'd be a lot of work to get up to speed because new grads already don't know as much as they think they do, but years without using the fundamentals is even harder. Id say your best bet is to look for something small in a non tech area. Get a few years doing that before trying to go for a software heavy company. Less competition and generally not as aggressive of timelines. I did that for years before moving into big tech.",
