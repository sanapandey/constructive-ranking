    "selftext": "Working for a gov agency with benefits + pension, less than 90k/yr. 3 YoE, and have this extreme desire to find another company? I feel undervalued, bored, and lacking mentorship from more experienced devs. No one on my team gives feedback on my code, I built out our entire testing framework cause there was no initiative before me to do so, the work is not as close to software engineering as I want. That said, it's laid back, slow moving, hybrid, and I get a lot of praise for my work (which I think is due to a lack of comparisons). Is the grass always greener at other companies? I don't want to work FAANG (turned down the jungle with 150k offer after an internship, as large monolithic corporations are not my desire). ",

Your job sounds terrible to me, but not terrible to others I\u2019m sure. Only you can decide what\u2019s worth it",

Ask yourself, do you see the negative aspects of your work improving and do you see your career growing there? If both those answers are no, then probably start looking for a new job",

If you get tricked, learn and move on. If you\u2019re not happy at your current job, try something else, but don\u2019t do it without intentionality; think about what you\u2019d like to be different with your next job, and try to go somewhere that\u2019s closer to that ideal than your current job.\n\nYou have a job and it sounds stable. Start applying for other positions, and remember that you should interview the employer as much as they interview you. The right place will respect this, and the wrong ones won\u2019t. If you can stomach working this job indefinitely, I\u2019d say just apply to others on the side and jump ship when that better opportunity arrives.",

I'm on my 5th job. I have worked for large non tech, medium tech, startup 1, startup 2, and now large silicon valley company. I chased the company and status more than my skills over the last 10 years. While I'm doing ok financially I wish I had taken on more challenging roles and frankly tried harder instead of comfortably cruising earlier on.\u00a0",

Defined benefit programs have the benefit of removing the uncertainty of your lifespan from the retirement math, which is very nice for planning, so your additional retirement accounts can then be used for reducing your retirement age even further. Weight this value highly if your family is long lived and you are setting yourself up for long term health already.",
