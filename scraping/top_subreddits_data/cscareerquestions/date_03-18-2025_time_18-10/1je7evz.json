    "selftext": "I graduated with a CS degree back in December 2022 and currently work for a company that supports a government agency as a Systems Analyst (not a dev role). This is my second job - I worked at my first job for 1.5 years, until October 2024. \n\nThe government agency in question got hit with massive budget cuts and is currently laying off a lot of people. \n\nMy manager said that our revenue is already on a decline. He also said that there our jobs are \"not at risk\", but I don't really believe him. \n\nI've already started applying to other\njobs - What should I tell the recruiters about why I'm already looking for a different job? I've only been at my current job for around 6 months, and I really can't use \"looking for growth\" as an excuse anymore. \n\nShould I tell them that I might get laid off soon?\n\n\n\n",

I like to follow a simple principle: keep hidden things hidden, unless revealing them gives you leverage.\n\n\nRegardless if it's justified or not, lack of raises might give your counterparty reason to believe you lack some kind of quality (leadership skills, dedication, ambition, ...). It's a psychological game.",
