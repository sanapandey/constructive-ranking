You should read our [Resume FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_resumes) and implement any changes from that before you ask for more advice.\n        \nAbide by the rules, don't be a jerk.\n        \n**Note on anonomyizing your resume:** If you'd like your resume to remain anonymous, make sure you blank out or change all personally identifying information. Also be careful of using your own Google Docs account or DropBox account which can lead back to your personally identifying information. To make absolutely sure you're anonymous, we suggest posting on sites/accounts with no ties to you after thoroughly checking the contents of your resume.\n        \nThis thread is posted each **Tuesday and Saturday at midnight PST**.

I currently have that estimated from 2021-2026, but I finished my Masters in 2023 and had that listed on my resume. \n\nI went from undergrad to masters due to the pandemic and other things in life where I couldn't even apply for an internship or full time job, so that was my only option. Towards the end of my Masters, I had several offers in hand, but due to similar circumstances I ended up starting the PhD.\n\nNo internships, ever. One contract job, and the VR SWE was a volunteer position at the same University I'm doing my PhD at since they couldn't pay me for more than one job. I ended up doing it to stay relevant, and was promised meetings with a FAANG/F500s that specialize in it that never happened.\n\nI might end up going through this entire academic experience without an internship which is worrying me for the job market afterwards. I have more projects that I can put up from over the years, but who knows how relevant they are nowadays. I'm also hoping not to get paid SHIT in the industry, if I can even crack it at this point.\n\nNo, I don't want to teach. I spent the past five years (as of right now) getting paid less than janitors to write software from the ground up and teach assist so graduates can get 10x what I make, and two years before that doing it for free. I first wrote code when I was eight. I was in it for the passion, but I want money.",

In an effort to get any sort of experience or and just projects to put onto my resume I decided to think of any problems or areas within my work at the boba shop that I can improve by creating software to just make the job a bit easier. Well after proposing the ideas and the boss saying yes, I've developed a couple things and have actually put it in the projects section of my resume. I'm also getting paid to create these software which I think is pretty important to note. Would this sort of thing be better allocated to my related work experience or something that I should keep in my projects section?",
