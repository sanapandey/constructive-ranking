I currently already have 4 lesson preps and I was told I would likely get 1 lesson preps removed so not much would change. \n\nWell I found out today that I not only would get to keep 1 or maybe 2 sections of the class that was supposed to be removed, but that I also wouldn't get textbooks for this new class due to a lack of funding... \ud83d\ude05 We have some supplemental online resources that essentially amounts to busy work and really can only be stretched to cover maybe 1/2 of all instruction time... \n\nThis quote immediately popped into my head while I was being told the news... \n\nWe the unwilling, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible for the ungrateful. We have been asked to do so much for so long with so little, we are now qualified to do anything with nothing. \n\nAt this point the only thing I can do is laugh because otherwise I'd be crying. \ud83e\udd23 \n\n*vent vent vent* ",

Honestly, any teacher should know the topicthey are teaching inside and out... \n\nI could write some of these business textbooks from scratch while including citing real-world examples with just a bare bones outline to keep me on topic.\n\nWhat annoys me is that they are just expecting me to take up a new class with no textbook. \n\nJust because I CAN do it doesn't mean I WANT to teach a class and build everything from the ground up. Being forced to do this means hundreds of hours of building a fully fleshed out course with assignments and everything  else made from scratch. \n\nIf I had a textbook, I could just assign things and use the pre-made assignments in the book.",

We had to cut 26 million from budget last year and a lot of teachers had to move around and teach different subjects. \n\nIf you are K-8 certified you can teach any subject, but that doesn\u2019t mean one is a subject matter expert.  A history teacher who\u2019s been teaching history for 30 years should know their subject inside and out. I would also assume a teacher teaching the same class five times a day for a few years straight would know their stuff. \n\nI have five preps and two new classes this year. I know enough to be dangerous and stay ahead of students and that\u2019s enough for now.",

Schools seem to find everything to spend money on except the actual people face-to-face in the classroom dealing with children who deserve to have a curriculum to go with class.",
