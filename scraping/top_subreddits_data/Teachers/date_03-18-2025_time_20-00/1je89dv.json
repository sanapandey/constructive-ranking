I\u2019ve legitimately met people in my own graduate school teaching program who can\u2019t read.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating for a 1950s instruction style, and I love doing projects and social activities (debates, mock courts, etc.) with my students, but we definitely need some balance back. The whole \u201cwe can check for understanding without making kids do things they don\u2019t want to do\u201d argument is idiotic at best, and damaging to our kids at worst. \n\nAmericans used to stupidly say, \u201cwell, we might not have as much memorized knowledge as students from East Asia, but we\u2019re more creative because amurrrkuh\u2026 we got freedom and stuff\u2026\u201d and now we have measurable data that suggests kids from east Asia not only know more than we do, but are more adaptive and creative than we are too (because our kids have been trained that if they don\u2019t want to do something challenging, we will turn it into a game or a finger-painting project for them). The whole \u201clet the kids tell us how to teach them\u201d movement has been a pretty obvious failure.\n\nOnce again, I don\u2019t want to teach like a Norman Rockwell painting, but we gotta get kids learning those three R\u2019s (eww \u201c \u2018rithmatic\u201d) again.

Reading is limited to a paragraph. Behavior is out of control and at least half the class. \n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of contributing factors but it would help a lot of teachers and students if we had some actual standards for what they\u2019re expected to do and produce.",

                            "body": "Some of it is due to bigger structures at play too though. \n\nFor example, I\u2019m 38, and when I was in school (the 90s), it was a period of economic prosperity for upper-working class white people. My parents could afford to pay for a nice house in a good neighborhood with an above-average school system with 1 income (my mom worked part-time but was mostly home because I have a disabled brother), until about 2001 when things started to turn\u2026 but by then I\u2019d learned how to read, write, etc. (I was a high school sophomore), and if there were behavioral problems, my parents could deal with it instantly. \n\nNowadays, our economy requires two working parents, and in low income families, they need to work multiple jobs to survive. Many parents don\u2019t have the time to reinforce what we are teaching the way my parents could. The entire economy in America is designed so that we watch people\u2019s kids while they all work. \n\nThis was sold to Americans as a form of gender equality because women joined the workforce (which is awesome, obviously), but in reality it\u2019s also led to employers working hand-in-hand with landlords and properly developers to ensure that what once was possible with 1 income is now only remotely close to being possible with 2 (and even that is running away from us now). While parenting is never easy and all parents have struggles, the economic struggle modern parents face is much worse than what parents faced when I was a child.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say there also aren\u2019t parents who just fuck-off and those who don\u2019t think their kids need to respect us, but I think the big structural issues like our economy play a huge role in why it\u2019s so hard to get parents to buy-in and help in their kids\u2019 education (social-emotional and academic).",

                            "body": "I wouldn't agree with this entirely. 2000 years ago, the only people who were being educated were members of the global elite (probably less than 10% of the world population). These were people whose parents were similarly educated, who had access to their own tutors (Alexander had Aristotle, and despite me thinking I'm an awesome teacher, my kids don't get 1-on-1 time with one of the founding fathers of philosophy), and who could focus solely on nothing but their education. This system of education led to about 10% of the world population being literate (on the high side of the range). In most other industries, a 10% success rate would be perceived as failure.\n\nObviously, we'd have to also consider the fact that 2,000 years ago, lack of educational access was a design of the empires we often glorify; knowledge was withheld from the population majority in order for the elite minority to continue holding power, but it is fair to say that instructors 2,000 years ago got to be far more selective of their students than we get to be. The \"classical approach\" to teaching worked for the wealthy elite of society 2,000 years ago, but we have extremely limited data to suggest that the same type of instruction would work if Aristotle was working with a class of 28 students from the peasantry, who were striving towards becoming the first literate people in their families. This is the reality for many of our students, though.\n\nIn my opinion, balance is key. I think students should learn how to listen to a lecture and how to take notes during a lecture, ask questions... basically be an active listener, because it generally benefits them when they go to college, or maybe listen to a politician at a rally. I also think group work is important because it teaches students how to work socially, how to compromise, delegate work, etc.\n\nI think the demonizing of direct instruction has been a trendy thing to do in academia and in PD's, and I definitely think the idea that \"everything has to be fun for kids\" is stupid, because it isn't based in reality: kids will eventually become adults and have to do things they don't like, and we should help them build resilience towards that when they are children.  \n  \n I also think that amidst the current material conditions of not just what happens inside of our classrooms, but also outside of our classrooms, trying to make the case that what worked for Alexander the Great, an aristocrat of his time, should work for a student who recently migrated to America, is still learning English, has to take care of his siblings when he's home because his parents work 3 jobs, none of them able to help them with homework because they are not literate in English, probably works a job too in order to help pay rent, and has a myriad of other distractions in his life is a really difficult point to defend, and largely ignores the material conditions of both groups of people.",

My cousin is a licensed electrician, and I\u2019ve seen his notebooks from studying for his license exams\u2026 and they were very complex and detailed. \n\nMy school has a very competitive vocational program, and many of the kids are surprised (and mortified) when they see the large, old-school text books that the auto-tech, cosmetology, welding and carpentry teachers assign to the kids. Our cosmo-kids graduate with their state cosmetology license, and the state exam is TOUGH. I\u2019ve taken a practice version of it myself, with no cosmo-knowledge, and bombed it\u2026 and I have a graduate level degree. Kids who pass all say that they took a ton of notes and studied very hard.

They honestly think there\u2019s some underlying agenda meant to indoctrinate students. \n\nThe best way to stay narrow minded is to disregard any outside opinion as persuasive. Once parents started realizing that social sciences are up for debate, they arrived at the worst possible conclusion that teaching history is therefore attempting to persuade children to accept narratives. I don\u2019t agree with a lot of ideas that mainstream public school education has taught me. I\u2019m still glad I was given that education. \n\nHistorians often make criticisms of the very primary sources they cite. Psychology papers often begin with the researchers talking about whether they even think the popularly accepted definitions for certain terms are useful. One day, it will be a damn good thing your kid paid attention in history class because they won\u2019t be absolutely surprised to learn that not everyone contextualizes events the same way. \n\nTl;dr yeh if you want kids to be more open minded and \u201cresistant to indoctrination\u201d, you should actually be in favor of teaching humanities and applied sciences",
