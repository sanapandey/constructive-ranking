    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019ve been an educator for the past decade, mostly in non-profit theater education (my username checks out). I\u2019m also a new dad who needed to get out of non-profit because it doesn\u2019t pay well and there\u2019s more upward mobility in teaching (I know, I literally moved to teaching because it pays more).\n\nDecided to go back to substitute teaching and I\u2019m honestly loving it. So much, in fact, that I am going back to Grad School to pursue my Master\u2019s in teaching since I don\u2019t quite have my full teaching credentials yet.\n\nI found out yesterday that I got a $3000 scholarship for grad school. Considering how much my master\u2019s is going to cost me and how I\u2019ve been fearing how I\u2019m going to be able to juggle both providing for my family and pay for school, this is coming at a good time.\n\nWanted to share my good news to Reddit. My wife is proud (and I\u2019m pretty certain my 3-month old is too).",
