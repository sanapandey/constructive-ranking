    "selftext": "HB 267 was a union busting bill which made public workers lose their ability to negotiate fair wages, safe working conditions, and benefits. The Protect Utah Workers ballot referendum will allow voters to restore collective bargaining rights, ensuring public workers have a seat at the table to negotiate for fair pay and better working conditions.\n\nYou can find signing locations at\nhttps://www.protectutahworkers.com",
