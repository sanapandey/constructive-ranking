He had a blockage in his urinal tract which is deadly for cats.\n\nI left very detailed sub plans, had everything already ready to go and organized for the day, and even requested that the sub please leave a note of what was able to be accomplished at what wasn\u2019t able to be accomplished.\n\nI come into my room this morning and literally nothing was even touched. Everything the students were supposed to work on was still in the Monday bin.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEDIT: A lot of people are getting mad at me thinking that I\u2019m upset with the sub or that things didn\u2019t get done. I honestly didn\u2019t expect much to get done, but I would\u2019ve at the very least liked a note like \u201cthe kids were good\u201d even if no work got done. My actual concern was that I would get in trouble for not leaving sub plans, EVEN THOUGH I DID, because this year admin has repeatedly nagged teachers for not leaving sub plans, only to find the plans left in plain sight and the sub/subs just didn\u2019t even try to look for them. When I wrote my post, I was kind of rushing and didn\u2019t explain very well.",

This man would step into any role needed whenever he was available to do so. Custodian out sick? This guy was in the classroom sprinkling the litter stuff on the vomit. Substitute didn't show? He was in the classroom until another solution could be reached. Paras and aids asking for a raise? He's advocating for them. He learned every single kid and employee name within the first 2 weeks of a new school year.\n\nHe passed away from cancer. While sick, knowing it was terminal, he took his soon-to-be replacement under his wing and did his best to make sure she was fully prepared. He worked until it was not possible and passed very shortly after. It seemed like the whole city showed up for this man's celebration of life. The high school gym was filled  to standing room only. There were people in the halls that couldn't fit in the gym.\n\nI miss him. I miss him very much. I realize how different and special he was and think of him with every  \"admin sucks\" comment.",

I was honors all the way through and while it still didn\u2019t fully prepare me for what\u2019s next I\u2019m very happy I had it instead of regular classes. Only AP I ever took was English. My downhill trend started in high school. My foundational core was built in elementary school (as I\u2019m sure it should be) and it essentially carried me when I got into the \u201cthis is stupid why do I need school\u201d phase. I read at a high level, I can write at a high level and when I was interested I did very well. It was all the times I wasn\u2019t interested where I got into trouble. I don\u2019t blame teachers for that, that was a me issue. As teachers how handcuffed do you feel on a day to day basis? It appears to me that most teachers aren\u2019t set up for success, rather set up to get even. Idk if that\u2019s a policy or admin issue but I wish there was a real legit way to fix it. My biggest fear is one day we elect a president that can\u2019t read because per policy or whatever they were just passed along to the next person. I\u2019ll get off my soapbox now. Teachers, you don\u2019t get enough help, money, or respect, but I know I wouldn\u2019t be where I\u2019m at today if it wasn\u2019t for some of the amazing teachers I had along the way",

He started with congratulations, I got a dozen emails from parents of the 80 students you subbed for. Every one of them was a glowing review of how well you did, and even more important how great the department looks for the fact that you were able to do this and that the teacher had prepped you so well. Thank you for making us look good. \n\nI am sorry, my experience isn\u2019t more common. But I take my job very seriously, as do my coworkers.",

But just know most subs will try to do everything they can to complete what you have listed \n\nFor me, If the class was great or just ok, I will often give my personal number and get text messages from teachers who really appreciate what I did, asking for me to sub again or they were told by their kids they really liked me.\n\nAs a sub i have mixed emotions. I do like to teach as I am an ESL teacher for adults, so sometimes just putting on a video is really boring for me... especially if I have some experience in what they're talking about or related to the lesson. For difficult classes just giving them time on their computers or something they can/like to do is great.\n\nOther times I am knowledgeable on the subjects I select, Like art, history, geogrpahy, earth science, sociology, and foreign language and really like it when teachers let me teach a lesson. I taught a group of 4th graders one day about earthquakes in Japan, because they were learning about it in earth science and natural disasters. I showed them some videos and what the warning alarm that is sent to your phone sounds like. They were really into it and then we talked about the lesson. But this was luck and I know the teachers can't meet the subbefore orr plan something for each sub.\n\nBut sometimes I see what they were learning for the regular lesson and know i could've continued, but  I just have to hand out a worksheet. And sit there for several hours in silence. It's fine but I get bummed out. \n\nBut again I do what I can and follow the sub plans as closely as I can. But I do try to build rapport and teach a warm up or intro related to what their doing in class.",

A sub plan should always be \"Hand out this worksheet to the class, and collect when it's over.\"  You can vary this by writing instead, \"have students read pages X - Y in the text book and do problems 1, 2, 3, on page Z.\" If you want one more variation, \"Press play on the projector, the movie should queued to the right place\" also works. But anything more complex than that and you're being unfair to the sub who the kids won't listen to and is not trained in your field.",
