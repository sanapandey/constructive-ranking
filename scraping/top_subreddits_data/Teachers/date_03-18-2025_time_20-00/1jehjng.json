I just want to talk theory and theme with them all the time, and I wish I could put all my energy into making them the coolest lesson plans so they could just keep ascending bc they\u2019re gonna be life changers. But instead? 85% of my brain goes to crap like data collection and all the accompanying nonsense that isn\u2019t even guaranteed to be enough to \u2018allow\u2019 me to keep my job. \n\nI know it\u2019s been said but for real, I just want to teach.
