    "selftext": "I teach 8th grade history. Last lesson of the day was going pretty well until I looked at X. He took was moving hand in his pocket in a \"specific\" manner. Fortunately other students didn't notice. After the lesson X didin't answer any of my questions nor say anything and just looked away.It turned out he had a big hole in his pocket.\nAfter that I gave him detention, sent an e-mail to the principal and called his mom. She said something along the lines of \"Oh, X has an IEP and he's just a teen boy. You should have just covered him up with a blanket\" First of all his IEP stated he had more time on tests and quizzes and even if he had different needs I wouldn't just let him masturbate on my lesson. What should I do?\n\nEdit: Principal answered my e-mail and said he's going to have a talk with me and X's mom tomorrow. I'll update after the meeting.\nEdit 2: his IEP has other things in it, but they're completely irrelevant just like the additional time, but mom brought his IEP during the talk up and how he is a 'slow thinker'",

Parents are expecting us to work miracles, and the legal process and requirements, including the data collection, documentation, and reports, are cumbersome to the point where teaching a student effectively often takes less time than writing the report on what the child learned. \n\nI honestly think that beautiful, thorough documentation and data of a child learning NOTHING would be preferred over bare bones evidence of a child making substantial, meaningful, effective academic gains.  Do parents want their child to read, or do they want their child\u2019s teacher to write reports about how their child struggles to read? I honestly do not know sometimes.\n\nThere needs to be a better system than either  \u201cignore the child and refuse to educate because of a disability\u201d and the current system, which assumes that is the case unless there is absurd data/documentation/reporting of the contrary.\n\nSpecial education should be amazing.

Quite a few students are learning disabled and non social, but still pay the school to essentially prolong their high school education despite them not actually being able to work along their peers in an adept manner in any field.

I figure most families keep difficult children in school so they can to keep themselves from carrying the entire burden.",

Do you actually want to know where severely disabled kids were back in the days of apocryphal Sister Mary Stigmata?\n\n1) Institutionalized \n\n2) Dead\n\nMany died as babies or young children due to lack of medical knowledge about how to save them or will to do so. The parents of those who survived were strongly encouraged to place them in institutions. A few were cared for at home by parents who had no idea how to help them learn or progress. They were isolated from society with no opportunity to learn or work or have any sort of community. And parents who thought their kids could benefit from education were legally told by their local school to fuck off. \n\nThe current system has problems, but let's stop pretending the previous system was a good one.",

The every two minutes thing sounds like this could be used to stop the momentum but I personally would not do that. But I'm not sure if a Board Certified Behavioral Analyst (BCBA) was involved with the IEP/BIP. Discrimination training would have been a better option (ex. You can do this in your room in private, but not in public something like that). If this was a behavior that was also happening at home, then this should have been worked on at home or clinical setting, then school. That way this could have possibly been avoided. It's not fair to expose others to that type of behavior.",

It\u2019s likely still worth a conversation about inappropriate public behavior, but in that scenario, it\u2019s a single data point (that likely has more to do with sensory input needs), not an immediate \u201ctalk to CPS.\u201d \n\nI hear about this a lot and it\u2019s actually quite dangerous for people to assume sexual intent with sensory-based actions, especially if the parents hear about it and act inappropriately. The thing to really be concerned about is if an elementary-aged child is mimicking adult masturbatory actions.",

They are multiple pages long and legal documents, so this is really to cover your own butt. Then document document document.

It baffles me why they didn\u2019t seat him next to other boys instead. It seems they were fine with unsettling everyone else just to spare one student potential discomfort or embarrassment.",

My wife is a SPED teacher and the stories are shocking and in many cases, sad. \n\nFirst off, most of the time it does involve a kid who has some divergence or is on the spectrum and is engaging in what would be otherwise normal behavior in private settings - however due to the issues they are challenged with cognitively speaking, many do not have the abilities to regulate themselves and so this behavior becomes aberrant due to that disregulation. \n\nThe next thing I\u2019d like to say is that, with the prevalence of these issues rising, now is the time to support our teachers and community representatives. We need to get on the phone with our lawmakers, we need to be speaking on their behalf. Our teachers and community needs resources to help handle these things, our mental health field representatives need to be supported to help support them, and we need to be actively engaged with that process. \n\nThe time is now - these challenges will not go away over night or be swept under a rug. We always look back at situations wondering where we could\u2019ve done better, and let me tell you this is one of those situations where we can be doing better. It\u2019s a fight we need to have and we better start having it now otherwise we\u2019re going to have bigger problems on our hands.

I brought it to her homeroom teacher. He just got uncomfortable and didn\u2019t do anything. I brought it to the Chinese co teacher that told me they would investigate by contacting the mom. Nothing happened. I brought it to the Chinese lower school principal who told me that I was mistaken. That they spoke with the mom who told them the girl was \u201citching\u201d. \n\nSo, I recorded a very short clip of about five seconds and sent it to the lot of them. Immediately afterwards deleting the video. They started losing it saying that I needed to delete the video immediately. I told them I already had and wouldn\u2019t have recorded the video at all had they actually done something. \n\nThey confronted mom with the video. The behavior immediately stopped in class, but there was nothing further done to my knowledge with the family. \n\nI tell myself that at least she was never discovered by others and she didn\u2019t have that to deal with, but I wonder if I handled that in the best interest of the student. It\u2019s hard to tell sometimes but we do our best.\n\nHope you are doing well. This is an extremely frustrating situation.",

Its kinda crazy some comments are saying report him to the police when this is definitely a child with special needs. While I'm in no way condoning or saying let him continue,this should be documented and a plan created/amendment. I'd ask an Adaptive Special Education for help as self-gradification is used by some for sensory seeking although its usually seen more in younger children.(8th grade is definitely the oldest I've ever seen) I once knew a 7th grader that had an instance like this except he did it at a female student and was suspended but he was back the next day. I'd be surprised if there any legitimate consequences since the events over and you properly reported to the parents and assumingly admin after the school day ended. That being said Im sorry you had to deal with that as I'm sure that was not a comfortable moment. As someone who's in special education, I sympathize and have to remind myself that tomorrow is a new day that can be better as long as we want it to be! Good luck and may your class never have to deal with this again.",
