    "selftext": "You read the title right.\n\nNever in a million years would I have ever expected to deal with this situation in teaching.\n\nFound out during an after school staff exam training meeting that a student in my freshman world history class killed someone. I teach at a title 1 urban school in a very poor and dangerous neighborhood. Lots of crime and shady people. \n\nAll I know is that the student was involved in some sort of street fight at like 2-3 in the morning, and then for whatever reason he pulled out a gun and shot someone in the head. \n\nNever saw any red flags or warnings in the kid. Definitely not an angel by any stretch of the imagination, as he was actually one of my more disruptive students, but never in a million years would I have thought that he would be capable of killing someone\u2026\n\nI\u2019m blaming this fight culture that has been engrained in the students and parents of urban communities. All the kids talk about is fighting, and the parents support it. All of our disciplinary issues at this school are dealing with some sort of physical or verbal acceleration between students. \n\nWhen are we going to start holding parents accountable for student violence? \n\nWhy haven\u2019t we created healthy coping mechanisms for children in these communities who are dealing with trauma and suppressed anger? I\u2019m talking supports from preschool from grade 12, because these kids need it. \n\nI cannot wait to leave this district and go suburban or rural. ",

At one point, we had a mom calling the school demanding that we let her 17 year old daughter fight a 14 year old boy. The mom then came to the school to try and break in, so that she could get her daughter out of class and fight the other kid. When that didn't work, the mom waited until after school. She held the boy down in the parking lot so that her daughter could knock the other kid's teeth out.\n\n\nWe had multiple fights where parents came onto campus and beat up kids.",

It is really difficult - if not impossible - for me to truly understand the situation that many of these kids are living in.\n\nI was, by NO means, a perfect child. I absolutely did things my parents didn't know about and wouldn't have approved of. I was in places I shouldn't have been and made decisions and engaged in behaviors that I shouldn't have ... but it was NOTHING like this.\n\nI don't understand a world in which it's acceptable for a FOURTEEN year old child to be out on the streets at 2am on \"a school night\". I can't understand thinking that engaging in a physical altercation with a stranger is normal or reasonable. I can't believe a parent thinks that their child carrying a gun is a good idea. I can not grasp thinking that shooting someone in the head is a reasonable response to whatever disagreement they had.  \n\nSomewhere, our society took a really wrong turn. \n\nSadly, this is the reality in the lives of way too many urban youth. If they make it to adulthood, their children (many of whom will grow up in an unstable household, likely not with both of their biological patents) will be raised in similar situations, because it has become their norm. \n\nYour student ... a child ... ended another life last night, and also essentially ended his own. He will likely spend a good amount of time in jail, and the options available to him after that have been drastically reduced, with the quality of his life from here on out negatively impacted in a permanent way.  \ud83d\ude1f",

You sound incredibly ignorant as to how they work and naive about their efficacy. I can only assume you\u2019ve not actually had to overcome dozens of barriers to your own health and financial security with government programs.\n\nI was dead broke when I was a student and needed food stamps. It changed my entire life when I got them after graduating college. I couldn\u2019t get them during college because full time students can\u2019t get food stamps. Do you understand what that means for parents seeking higher education? I was making 11k a year at the time and barely qualified. Imagine making more than me, which is easy to do and which MUST be done if you\u2019re gonna take care of yourself and one other child, being dead broke and out of options and you still don\u2019t qualify for these resources? \n\nI watched my single mother of three exhaust all her options my whole upbringing to access these resources. Racist ignorants who have meaningfully interacted with perhaps 2 Black women in their entire life said about my hardworking, dedicated mother what you said in your comment. But I do not know many people who could do what my mother did. I remember when she started making too much money and got cut off. She was making 35k a year, taking care of three kids, and going to college with a mortgage. She never drank or did drugs, my mother worked three jobs at one point and had to put her children in the trust of unsavory people because childcare was too damn high. Her addiction of choice were shitty men, and why would she choose different when everyone else around her is asking her for money, nobody else is showing up for her, and these abusive men are the only people WATCHING her kids and PAYING the bills? Are you gonna go raise these people\u2019s kids, the ones who you say need to get off their ass and parent the kids, the ones who can\u2019t parent their kids because ***they\u2019re trapped in a cycle of poverty???*** I didn\u2019t fucking think so. But plenty of abusive assholes will, unfortunately, and that\u2019s REALITY. Not a list of terms I posted to sound like I know what I\u2019m talking about, but an actual real life story. \n\nYou sound like somebody who has never ever come even close to what I experienced even as a child free singleton in college, listing off a bunch of government benefits that you\u2019ve never had to use or implement and completely ignorant to how they work or when they apply. In the USA, kids learn to neglect their bodies *because* of our shitty healthcare. Parents are working so hard that they neglect their kids\u2014and succumbing to addiction to manage pain stress and violence is HUMAN, it\u2019s a totally normal response and we fix it by addressing the origins of the stress and pain and violence\u2014which is our useless fucking government. If people didn\u2019t have to hustle and make money because employment is rife with ableism and racism and transphobia and nepotism, if people could afford a decent living with blue collar jobs, if kids had reliable out of school time spaces to go to outside of the streets, then they couldn\u2019t even be targeted by adults who exploit them by trafficking them into gang violence. That\u2019s the result of neglect, loneliness, and violent pressure by adults in their lives\u2014NOT some kind of inherent propensity for violence. And if you believe outdated white supremacist bullshit that\u2019s not any of our fault, we can\u2019t force you to read a book and learn shit. \n\nThose are a few examples of *dozens* of barriers that these kids and their families are facing. \n\nI bet you couldn\u2019t even describe what restorative justice is in your own words. And I\u2019m not really interested in seeing whatever definition you come up with after googling it real quick either so please don\u2019t double down. You can spew half-baked ideas about topics you don\u2019t know about and situations you have never experienced. But I want you to know, you only look smart to folks who are brainwashed enough to believe you based on their own uninformed biases, without doing their own research. \n\nThose of us who actually know what the fuck we\u2019re talking about? We can easily identify and recognize the ignorance in your words because ***it\u2019s not true to life***. And shame on you if you\u2019re a teacher, being so willful in your ignorance that you blame victimized CHILDREN for problems they did not create for themselves.",

Does it happen in wealthier communities, too? Absolutely, but it's rare, and it's usually not condoned by the well-off and educated parents. I think it's because they've got other ways to *\"show off\"* and be prideful. The $100,000 car, the mansion, the new addition to the pool house, the new golf cart, etc... Having your kid being the fighting menace in these types of communities isn't something that the parents want since they believe it reflects badly on them/their family, and their kid will be talked about and shunned. However, in communities with systemic poverty, I've noticed that it's much more a problem. God forbid your kid lose a fight or get disrespected, because somehow that reflects badly on themselves and their family *(from what I've experienced)*. They take it as a personal affront to their pride and reputation.",

Not that I am diminishing the choices of said student, but I think there is some unconscious bias\u2019 in your school about the students and community. I would be curious about who told you/the group this information, making sure that it was from an administrator who has first hand verified information and not someone spreading a story. I now put on PD around a specific group and had one district where the entire staff held a believe about a group of kids that was based on a lie/story that was passed on for years. \n\nThat said, if this is known information then we can assume the kid did time in juvie or was otherwise dealt with legally. If they\u2019ve been dealt with, please don\u2019t hold a mistake over a 14 yo\u2019s head for the rest of their school career. You didn\u2019t speak to any context about the situation but they\u2019re a kid, keep watering them. You are not going to hold parents accountable for student violence, your administration needs to if it\u2019s happening at school. If it\u2019s not happening at school, why the angst? We can assume your keep using urban as black and brown kids. I would really recommend examining the historical implications and violence that slavery and genocide has left in these communities before blaming the people that were having this violence perpetrated against them. Teach about that in class if you want to show the kids you\u2019re on their side.",
