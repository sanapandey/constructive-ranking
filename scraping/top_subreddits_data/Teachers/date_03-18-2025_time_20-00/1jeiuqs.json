My son showed me screenshots and swears every teacher has one.\n\nI'm currently on leave because a couple of students (all friends, failing my class) have decided to lash out at me. One is making an allegation and the others are corroborating. They are claiming it happened during class and I am hoping that someone will come forward and tell the truth.\n\nEven if they do, this will probably cost me my job. Possibly my career. Obviously this is a nightmare and I'm not the only teacher dealing with this right now.\n\nSo please be vigilant.",

Especially since it could happen to other teachers.\n\nI'm not TOO worried about myself, but that's because most of my classes I can count on there to be at least one kid who will tell the truth. Ironically enough we've seen the consequences of not telling the truth when we watched The Crucible this year. But the real reason most classes have at least one kid is because some of these kids I've taught since the start of their freshman year and have formed a bond with me. They'd throw hands with a kid who tried to cost me my job.\n\nMy first job I resigned because they admitted they planned to not renew my contract but hadn't made it official yet. Part of it was likely due to a student who was lying about me or taking things I did/said out of context. Several kids tried to get my job back by texting the girl pretending to be on her side and got her to admit she lied to try and get me fired. They tried to bring the proof to my admin but unfortunately it didn't do much since I had already formally resigned. But I appreciate their efforts. And if that's how kids reacted that had me for ONE year, kids who have had me for 2 or 3 years at this point are probably more willing.",
