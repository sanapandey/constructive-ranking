If we email you to set up a time for interviews or screenings, please reply in a formal manner. Incomplete sentences, lack of greetings, one word replies - we\u2019ve seen it all and it greatly affects your chances of getting a job. You\u2019re not texting a friend, you\u2019re applying for a job. ",
