    "selftext": "There\u2019s obviously been a fad the past 15 or so years for primary instruction that downplays or omits computational practice, math fact memorization and standard algorithms, in favor of multiple newer algorithms, \u2018conceptual understanding\u2019 and an inquiry-based approach to instruction. The mounting parallels to the fiasco in early literacy instruction are hard to avoid seeing\n\n-Individual charismatic gurus who make personal profit by marketing a philosophical approach with a high media profile\n\n-Declining outcomes both in NAEP scores and the consensus of reports from teachers in higher grades\n\n-Pushed by for-profit curriculum companies\n\n-An approach most beloved by constructivists in education training & higher ed programs \n\n-A complete and total lack of independent RCT empirical evidence for the approach yielding good outcomes",

Every year, the meeting is the same.  What can we do?  My Calculus students can barely handle fractions and have no cdea how to deal with exponents.  What is happening?\n\nIt is simple.  My Calculus students 20 years ago had done thousands of fraction problems.  Most before Geometry.  It was a part of the every day math language. \n\nMy Calculus students today have done about 10% of those problems.  \n\nIt's not a mystery, but it is a point to realize that we still need to practice those skills.  Frequently.",

The result was that I couldn\u2019t do very basic math until I was fifteen and my dad homeschooled me with the method he learned as a kid. Suddenly it actually made sense for the first time ever. \n\nWith the \u201cnew\u201d method, there were some worksheets where the \u201cright\u201d answer would not be the actual answer to the math problem, but something else that you get by using one of the \u201cvisualizations\u201d. (One I remember asked for 15 divided by 3. If you wrote the answer was 5, that would be wrong. The right answer would be 15, because having 3 5s is the same as having 15 1s, and you were supposed to draw 15 1s, circle 3 bunches of them, and then count how many 1s there were.) That was always what confused me the most.",

We don't even need an unbroken chain of learners and teachers interacting, in person, as do, for example, tool-using chimpanzees. Even if no one around me knows anything about trigonometry, even if everyone who knew trigonometry died tomorrow, I could read books and learn. I would not have to reinvent trigonometry (thank god, because it would never happen.)\n\nA dog can't know what dogs 2,000 years ago learned during their lifetimes and then build upon their knowledge. I can. A dog learns through inquiry and behavior conditioning and everything a dog needs to know must be discovered anew by each dog born on this earth and dies with that dog. I can absorb knowledge that is millennia old and then add my own to the pile before I die. \n\n*Inquisitiveness* is vital. \"Inquiry learning,\" *when done well* has its place. (But in reality, it's so rarely done well, and that just leads to disastrous misconceptions.) Elevating inquiry over knowledge acquisition, however, really kinda spits in the face of the whole being human thing. Explain all that to the next edu-consultant presenter and ask if they think human children should just be learning like dogs. Then ask if they've heard of the \"natural fallacy\" and if they can draw any text to text connections. Then politely inquire about the dollar amount of their speaking fee. I promise you it will be the best meeting you've ever been to that wasn't cancelled.",

You know, fuck the studies about the benefit of summative assessments helping form the neurological paths and recall, and the test-taking skills themselves, we gotta go-go-go to fit in content before late April/early May, with a month and a half to spare after.  There's no sense of starting or ending our units, just jumping into the next thing day by day, and when most of your kids are already bordering on 2-grade-levels below, it's a special type of malpractice and developmentally inappropriate delivery.\n\nThe leadership has straight faces saying this is good practice, and I've said more than once in my department meetings \"I'm willing to bet none of us tried to learn 7th or 8th grade math like this at their age.\"",

I have had to have a pile of laminated multiplication tables available for students to access for a few years now for when we're teaching content that is assumed/tested on the non-calculator day, and part of the drills I do with a swath of kids in preparation for our state tests is them spending 15-20 minutes making their own multiplication tables for the non-calculator day.  \n\nI said this on another thread about the lack of background knowledge and/or retention that is startling in my students, but for quite a few some of the things like multiplication/division fact recall sounds like an absolutely shocking concept to them, and when we're at this level doing multi-step problems where recalling those facts is just *one step*, it's bad.   Trying to \"scaffold\" and \"differentiate\" this content becomes a Herculean pipedream when we're trying to justify pushing kids along without prerequisite ability.",

I am 37 and took advanced mathematics for my degree. I know math. The whole thing of focusing on grouping things to the correct tens column. It was so stupid and seems so much more complicated. I don't blame my niece for hating it. \n\nI feel so bad for you teachers having to teach this crap. Yes i understand the reasoning and it actualy makes sense in preparation for coding (switching to base 2 for binary etc) but it is so stupid to have that be the base for all mathematical knowledge. Learning times tables up to ten was so much more useful back in the day.",

Some kids don't really have any science classes until 6th grade.\n\nSecond, they are pushing inquiry in science. Which is great...except you cannot just throw kids into inquiry with our current system. Biology in my school, for instance, must be covered in 16 weeks. Every standard. Why? Because they have an end of semester state test that they are \\[partially\\] evaluated with. Guess how long it would take to cover those same standards using the inquiry method? Yah...way more than 16 weeks.\n\nThird, science requires math. Especially in high school. The kids aren't good at math. Not to mention the literacy requirement in science...which is slightly less than the math, but their are a lot of new terms they have to learn. A one-two punch to the gut for science. They suck at math. They suck at reading. Good luck science teachers!\n\nFinally, too many districts refuse to just move fully into a program. My district really, really likes the \"phenomena\" approach to teaching science, but it's bullshit. I'm okay with the methodology, but once again they expect me to utilize this approach while also continuing to cover all of the standards. Not feasible unless you just want me to do a dog-and-pony-show of appearing to use phenomena, but not really doing it.",
