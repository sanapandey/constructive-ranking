    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm wondering if anyone else can relate to this.\n\nI'm a new teacher, and lately I've been experiencing severe anxiety right before class\u2014especially on weekends when anticipating the upcoming week. Every time I'm about to start teaching, my anxiety spikes dramatically. I start trembling, my legs shake, and my instinct is just to leave the school building immediately.\n\nMy classroom management is fine, and my lessons are not the best but they are improving. The students also appear engaged most of the time. Yet, I just can't seem to shake this relentless nervousness. I've never felt this level of anxiety in any other job or situation before in my life. Only teaching triggers it. Especially just before class is about to start. I\u2019ve had to go to the bathroom and calm myself down.\n\nIt\u2019s impacting me significantly, to the point where I'm seriously contemplating whether teaching is the right career for me.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n  \n",

That will subside in time, once you get into your teaching routines and your confidence will build. You will realize that not every part of everyday has to be planned or perfect. Most times the children have no clue what you expected it to be like vs what it ended up being lol. They go with the flow and it doesn\u2019t bother them. Don\u2019t overthink every single lesson. Just pick one thing that day that you want to focus on and try to do well. The rest just let it be what it will be. I promise you\u2019ll get more comfortable!",

It was awful, but I got through it.\n\nMy best advice is to write down what went well, what you're proud of, and what you're excited for. It'll help your mind remember that things aren't always awful! Also talk to someone, for me it's my husband or my grandpa. Someone who supports you just listening can make a world of difference.",

I hadn\u2019t ever talked to a professional about my anxiety, but those first two years teaching I did start seeing a therapist and she helped me so much with managing my anxiety. I am lucky enough to be in a school district that provides counseling services to teachers, so I highly suggest looking into that. With that being said, it did get better for me as I adjusted to this profession and grew in skill & confidence. Teaching is A LOT and these feelings are so normal, but we don\u2019t have to let them control us. If seeing a professional isn\u2019t an option, see if there is a veteran teacher you feel comfortable forming a mentor-mentee relationship with, as that will be very helpful as you settle into your career. Sending you good vibes\u2014being a new teacher is tough!",

            "body": "It's very common for new teachers to experience anxiety, especially before class. The transition into the classroom can be overwhelming, and, understandably, you're feeling this way. You're definitely not alone. Here's a breakdown of why this might be happening and some strategies to help\n\nPossible Reasons for Your Anxiety:\n\nThe Pressure of Performance:\nTeaching involves constant performance in front of an audience. This can trigger performance anxiety, especially when you're still developing your confidence.\nThe feeling of being \"on stage\" can be intense, and the fear of making mistakes or not meeting expectations can be overwhelming.\nThe Weight of Responsibility:\nTeachers are responsible for the learning and well-being of their students. This responsibility can feel heavy, especially for new teachers. \u00a0 \nYou might worry about whether you're adequately preparing your students or if you're making a positive impact.\nUncertainty and Lack of Control:\nEvery class is different, and many variables are beyond your control.\nThe unpredictability of student behaviour and the need to adapt on the fly can contribute to anxiety.\nNew Environment and Routines:\nAs a new teacher, you are still getting used to the school environment, routines, and policies. This unfamiliarity can add to your stress.\nWeekends can create anxiety as you anticipate the return to this environment.\nPerfectionism:\nMany teachers are perfectionists, and they place high expectations on themselves. This can lead to anxiety when things don't go perfectly.\nStrategies to Manage Your Anxiety:\n\nAcknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:\nIt's okay to feel anxious. Don't try to suppress your feelings. Acknowledge them and remind yourself that it's a normal reaction.\nPreparation and Planning:\nThorough preparation can boost your confidence. Plan your lessons in detail, including potential student questions and activities. \u00a0 \nHaving a clear plan can reduce the feeling of uncertainty.\nMindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:\nPractice mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.\nThese techniques can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety symptoms. Especially deep breathing. \u00a0 \nPositive Self-Talk:\nChallenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations. \u00a0 \nRemind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments. Focus on what you're doing well. \u00a0 \nBuild a Support System:\nTalk to other teachers, mentors, or school counsellors. Sharing your experiences can help you feel less alone.\nHaving a support system can provide you with valuable advice and encouragement.\nFocus on Small Wins:\nCelebrate your successes, no matter how small. Acknowledge your progress and remind yourself that you're learning and growing.\nDo not focus on the things that went wrong, but on the things that went right.\nEstablish a Pre-Class Routine:\nCreating a consistent routine before class can help you feel more grounded. This could involve reviewing your lesson plan, organizing your materials, or taking a few minutes to relax.\nConsider Professional Help:\nIf your anxiety is severe and impacting your daily life, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counsellor.\nThey can provide you with personalized strategies and support.\nRealistic Expectations:\nRemember that it takes time to develop teaching skills and confidence. Be patient with yourself and don't expect perfection\nHope this help :)",
