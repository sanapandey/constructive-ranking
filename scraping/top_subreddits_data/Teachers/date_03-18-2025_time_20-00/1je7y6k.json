The thing is though, these tattoos are *really* good. I\u2019ve got over a dozen and have seen the work and WOW. Apparently there\u2019s a kid in town (like 17 or 18) who does \u201ccouch tattoos\u201d, meaning they give him money and he tattoos them while they sit on his couch. This kid\u2019s line work and shading are freaking incredible, plus he\u2019ll \u201cpractice\u201d on anyone that wants it. He only does black, and honestly he\u2019s better than most of the artists in town if not near the best.",
