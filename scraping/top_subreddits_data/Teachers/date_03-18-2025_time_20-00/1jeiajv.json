I explained to him that it was rude, if he meant it or not, and that if he blurted them out I wouldn't answer them. \n\nIf it's truly an issue of him being on the spectrum then being given the \"rule\" and the solution to have his questions answered will satisfy him.\n\nUnfortunately he could just also be kind of a sexist who wants to correct the woman, and using autism as his excuse (this is why most autistic girls and boys end up acting way different. Often bad behavior is excused by autism in boys, but even autistic girls are expected to know better) \n\nIf this is the case then treat him like any other sexist. You told him what to do if he had questions. This is the only way you'll answer them. If he continues, call home or whatever other consequence you'd give.",
