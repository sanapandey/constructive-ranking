Kid epically flunked the exam and didn\u2019t do the major project. \n\nParent sent an incredibly insulting email claiming no communication had been given about how her almost 18-year old crotch goblin had been doing that semester (I had the receipts with emails, phone logs, and conference notes). The icing on the cake was when this parent claimed that there was no way her child could have failed because their sibling had successfully made it through high school at the same school and never failed a class. \n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer that email within the 20 minutes she was expecting, she sent an even more insane email to the VP who also didn\u2019t respond right away. This prompted her to show up to school the next day with the kid and went full nuclear in the office. \n\nThis Karen-t tried to full on \u201cask for the manager\u201d to get her kid the credit so he could graduate. Crazy part was that the graduation was a few days later and the kid walked and I was furious.",
