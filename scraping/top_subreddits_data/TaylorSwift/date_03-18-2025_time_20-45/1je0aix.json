    "selftext": "I didn't understand this album on its release but it still became my favourite. \n\nI broke up with my childhood sweetheart. It's hurting me but I needed to do this. \"You're Losing Me\" is how I felt when things were \"okay\". And then \"High Infidelity\" happened where I cheated emotionally on him. (I'm trying not to pursue that relationship as I don't feel ready to date straight out of this though). \n\n\"The Great War\" was what we've been through these past weeks, although we did not survive the Great War. \n\nI think I've just grown up. 5.5 years... its a long time but it ended. I can't believe it ended but I believe this is what's right for us and we are going to grow into such beautiful strong people out of this.\n\nYeah basically TL;DR midnights is the perfect break up album where every song encapsulates the experiences and feelings I have gone through.

But I\u2019d also say it doubles as a pre breakup album!! \n\nTaylor described Midnights as an album of things that have haunted her and kept her up in the middle of the night throughout her life. It definitely seems like a lot of the songs off Midnights were inspired by a lot of anxiety and feelings around the ending of her last relationship before it ended, and also the feelings surrounding and dealing with the endings of her past relationships that she\u2019s felt over the years. \n\nBut there were also happier/ not sad tracks possibly inspired by her last relationship and the memories of it ( sweet nothing, snow on the beach, Paris, labyrinth, glitch, mastermind.). Which I think were included because there were times when maybe when the thought of ending things with someone first crosses your mind, you think of all the good times in your relationship. To convince yourself to reconsider a breakup or ending things. Because you have so much history and you don\u2019t want to throw everything away.\n\nIt perfectly encapsulates every stage of a breakup from Pre to middle to end",

But for me it's not an album about a breakup, but rather an album full of stories told from her side about the relationships she's had throughout her life. Each song has a story about anxiety, being in love, betrayal, sadness, growth... with people who have passed through her life. In the prologue she talks about the 13 sleepless nights and those 13 nights were people who passed through her life. That's my opinion.",

            "body": "I think Midnights definitely is a breakup album, but first and foremost it's some kind of thirties crisis album lol. It's about truly looking back at your life, maybe for the first time, and thinking about all the choices you've made, all the what ifs that haunt you, all the things that could be different if you just did or didn't do that one thing. All the things you might regret and also the things you don't regret at all. Your long time relationship of course plays a big part in this reflection. I really do get a feeling that she was looking back at her relationship too, all the good and the bad in it, and seriously questioning whether he was the right person for her. She was already processing a possible breakup.\n\n\nI've noticed that many younger people don't seem to like Midnights and I actually completely understand them even though personally it's my top3 album. Younger people are still busy making the life decisions they're going to question 10 years later when the crisis hits lol. Younger people also have fewer what ifs because they still have all the time in the world. I feel like the perception of time shifts somewhere in your 30s, especially if you're a female and considering whether you want to have children some day. Suddenly there's a sense of urgency, of running out of time, of having to somehow fix all the wrong choices you made, and this fuels the midnight reminiscence sessions and leaves room for regrets and what ifs. In TTPD she even states that \"I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free\".\n\n\nI unapologetically love Midnights and have loved it from the very first listening. After TTPD I love it even more because I feel like I can understand it better now.",
