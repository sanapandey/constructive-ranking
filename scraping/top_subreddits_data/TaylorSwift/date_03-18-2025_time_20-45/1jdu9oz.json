I wonder what other songs she deeply considered playing to open the tour. \n\nTo think that she had no idea that the tour would become this hugely interactive and fun thing for fans to celebrate and come together for is wild to me. Hundreds of thousands of people on those grainy livestreams, man. It literally became a game where we\u2019d fill out brackets and earn points and win prizes. I cannot imagine the joy that would bring me, had I curated something of that magnitude. \n\nMirrorball is such a beautiful song that I think really pays homage to Taylor as an artist and individual. I am so curious to know what she does next. Congrats Taylor!",

But she's worn snakes several times since last year and they all turned out to be for nothing (including a super obvious knee high with several snakes and rep font) and this is a brand of jewelry that she often uses that has several 'snake' pieces. But definitely, I'd count on this more than some crazy mathematical theory. \n\nWhat I don't really get is, if Rep was the next to come, why this much delay? TTPD hasn't been charting for a good while now. The audience and buyers of re-recordings are only swifties, so creating enough break before doesn't make sense. She's recorded them long ago. And the trademark thing isn't true, she can file them again always. I don't know, ending this good break from the charts with a re- recording feels like a wasted opportunity to me, given that Eras tour type has declined but Taylor hype and selling power is still there. With delay, what would be affected are the sales of a new album - not that of a  rerecording. I feel she has the opportunity to break the opening sales record with the new album if that's the next to drop.(without anything in between)",

And if  she makes Rep TV a brand new  ERA with full fledged promotions etc, it may get the attention of some GP too(like Red TV). Rep TV will do well any which way for a re-recording. But the thing is, the tour was the best time to get it out of the way with minimal effort for promotion. It would have done well. I guess she wanted to let TTPD era go on as long as it could.\n\nWhat's being put at risk I feel is TS12.\nThe thing is with back to back re-recordings and TTPD non-swiftie audience were feeling a Taylor overexposure. Remember how she was always getting shamed on SM for her \"chart obsession\" and blocking artists when she was just doing her work. The misinformation spread and people hated her for no reason. I feel that situation has changed in her absence in past many months. She had the stage set for a great comeback with a brand new album. Could be later this year or even early next year, but without anything in between. She could go on a full blown promotion tour next. TV, interviews etc. I just feel using all that possible momentum and anticipation for a re-recording is giving away the chance to probably surpass the record of Adeles 25. She may not really get that chance again if years pass in between.\n\nOr, maybe she is really going to push Rep TV on a really really high scale. Almost like its a new album itself. Maybe Rep TV is what she sees as the potential candidate to be her best seller over a new album. It helps that it's an album with bangers, most of which did not get popular last time. What she couldn't achieve with it back then, she may try this time. Anyway, we will see. But if it's going to be a normal release, I'm going to be really surpised that it took her this long.",

In fact, apart from personal reasons, a longer break is good for her from that saturation pov too. I'm just hoping(HOPING on a Reddit page, not demanding) that re-records don't come before new album now that it's taken this long anyway.\n\nIn fact re-recordings are what created the \"saturation cycle\" for Taylor as compared to other artists. New albums are something every artists do. So taking a long break to go into two re-recordings again is essentially the same cycle again. In the end it's going to be Taylor's decision. I had said this in previous comments of mine. She will do what makes most sense for her at that point. We're all just talking based on stuff known to us from the outside. \n\nIt's just that there are definite advantages of a new album from an artist at her level dropping after a significant gap - without any other releases in between. Non- fans are also going to be tuned in for a new album over a re-recording bec to them new music matters; her reason to re-record holds no sentiment. Every interested listener/buyer is an advantage. And that's all I said.\n\nHer intention with the re-recordings is to own her masters. She promoted Red TV big time but most others were very casual. What she plans to do with Rep, is to be seen. Whether she just wants to put it out asap to own her work, or maximise the sales aspect of it too.",
