As someone who only hears about Taylor stuff on Reddit, I didn\u2019t see any legitimate indication she would announce anything tonight or attend, just a lot of theories and hoping. Taylor\u2019s clearly on vacation from the spotlight right now. I don\u2019t think enough people understand it would be well within reason for her to take *years* off, that\u2019s what most artists do after a long tour. And most artists don\u2019t record four new albums + multiple re-records in five years.\n\nI get that clowning is fun for people, but it has gotten to be a bit too much for my taste when people mistake fan theories as fact and then get mad/entitled when something that was never promised doesn\u2019t happen.

Taylor isn\u2019t forcing people to clown over it every week. I like getting vault songs but none of these re-records have been life-altering (and honestly, many don\u2019t live up to the originals for me). Taylor has made it clear all along this is a project for *her* to own her work and that she doesn\u2019t expect anyone to care as much as she does about it. She\u2019ll release Rep and Debut when she pleases. The woman has released four new albums in five years and went on a two-year tour, and in the middle of that was a pandemic that I\u2019m sure altered many of her plans. The complaints are a bit much.",

My issue is not with people simply excited for something, my issue is with people speculating and then getting mad when their speculation isn\u2019t reality. Clowning is wrong like 98% of the time and so I just accept that the re-records will be happy surprises whenever they\u2019re released. I get the feeling Taylor doesn\u2019t think of the re-records as era-specific thing that needs to end before she can start a new chapter, but an ongoing project for when she has the time.\u00a0\n\nTaylor has been *incredibly* generous with her output the last few years, releasing significantly more than most artists in the span of a few years. She just ended a career defining tour and it would not be weird at all if she took like\u2026years off. I don\u2019t think she will, because she loves what she does and seems eager to work, but most artists would take a significant break post-Eras.\u00a0\n\nThis fandom\u2019s habit of expecting something shiny and new every few months is just a little tiresome, because frankly that\u2019s not normal, lol. Literally hours after TTPD dropped people were asking what\u2019s next. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a TikTok generation thing or because Taylor has spoiled us so much or what, but it\u2019s really atypical to expect so much from a musician. I\u2019m used to artists who feed me new music once every few years, where fan forums speculate the next time we\u2019ll hear something new from them after a 2024 tour is 2027.",

If Taylor came to the show tonight she would\u2019ve given the same speech she did on video, so I don't really see why that matters for all of us watching from home? It would\u2019ve been shitty if she didn\u2019t acknowledge the award at all, but she did and gave a beautiful and gracious speech.\n\nTaylor\u2019s re-record schedule was never transparent as far as I remember, she just said she\u2019d release them.\u00a0Many artists go years between *albums*, Taylor released four new ones, not counting re-records, in five years. Most artists tour for a few months and then take a year-plus off. Some of my favorite artists of all time go 2-3 years where I barely see them and I accept that\u2019s their time to write, record, and relax.\n\nTaylor spoils us in a way I think many fans have lost sight of. Yes, of course people can criticize, and I can think they sound wildly childish and entitled for doing so.\u00a0",

Then she was opening for Taylor not long after that despite being a pretty new artist.\n\nThat being said, I do enjoy her music quite a bit and thought she was good when I saw her live, but I also understand that she definitely has had a leg up and a faster route to a successful career in music than others (like Chappell and Sabrina, for example)",

With their music style, they had no business becoming as popular as they did. But their label was new, had money, and needed popular artists - so they sunk a lot of money into Primus and they got on MTV\u2019s Spring Break. He\u2019s learned that basically if a label wants you to get big, you will. \n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s weird to me that her album photo shoot is so basic? Like you have all of these connections but you chose that? So it comes across as even more insulting to artists that are more \u201cdeserving.\u201d Whoever those artists may or may not be. \n\nI like her music, though. I think she has talent. But I think the above is why people dislike her so much.",
