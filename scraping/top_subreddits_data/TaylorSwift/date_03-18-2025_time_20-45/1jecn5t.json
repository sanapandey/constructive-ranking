What Taylor song **sounds HORNY** *but*  the **lyrics** are **LOVING!**  \n\n(Extra clarification as requested: the *sound* we\u2019re looking for is sultry, sexy, seductive horny vibes (I feel like a degenerate writing this out). Imagine not knowing English, what vibes do you get from the instrumentals and voice? Now what Taylor song **sounds** the most \ud83e\udd75 **horny**  *but* has \ud83d\udc96 **loving lyrics**?)   \n\nYesterdays winner of *horny sound x sad lyrics* was *I Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever*! And a shoutout to the closest second place so far to *The way I loved you.*   \n\nMost upvoted song wins. Have fun!   \n\nPS: experimenting with timing, this is the new timing for now. This next round is starting 12 hours later than usual. \n\n",
