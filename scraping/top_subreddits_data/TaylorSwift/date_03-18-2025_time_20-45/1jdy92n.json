    "selftext": "We have entered the uh\u2026 well, the horny sounding section of the game. What Taylor song **sounds HORNY** *but*  the **lyrics** are **SAD!** \n\n(Extra clarification as requested: the *sound* we\u2019re looking for is sultry, sexy, seductive horny vibes (I feel like a degenerate writing this out). Imagine not knowing English, what vibes do you get from the instrumentals and voice? Now what Taylor song **sounds** the most \ud83e\udd75 **horny**  *but* has \ud83e\udd7a **sad lyrics**?) \n\nYesterdays winner of *loving sound x furious lyrics* was *Babe*! And a shoutout to the closest second place so far to *The way I loved you.* \n\nMost upvoted song wins. Have fun! \n\nPS: question about timing. I\u2019ve been posting these around 8-ish in the morning where I am but I know we\u2019re in a variety of different timezones. Should I continue with the same schedule or push it by 12 hours? \n\n",
