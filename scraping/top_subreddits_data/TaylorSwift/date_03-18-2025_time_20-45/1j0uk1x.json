For Taylor and Travis I'm convinced his old publicist was a source but he doesn't work with her anymore. Deux moi does have a pic/video of them from Wednesday night the 5th she's posting in her newsletter tomorrow. But generally I think sources of any other info are pretty limited now (and for many celebs)! \u00a0She hasn't stepped back about them being engaged she actually said that she was premature (as were many many many people \ud83d\ude05) but she is pretty certain they're engaged from multiple sources. That doesn't really matter just wanted to add she didn't step that back. It's more like new stuff she has nothing - and that goes for lots of celebs. \u00a0I've always viewed her skeptically, I think she just go lucky during Covid and was able to build her page up.\u00a0",

I've never had the vitriol for variants that others do, but they have indeed been getting increasingly out of control across the board and these seem like pretty straightforward ways of getting on top of it. Labels can still put out deluxes to try to game numbers, they just have to be a little more constrained (and therefore choosy!) about it.\n\nIf I'm reading the first-week rule right, though, then yeah, that's an end to the Midnights 3am/TTPD Anthology style drops. At first readthrough of a summary of the changes,  I thought \"okay midweek, that doesn't rule out sameday drops\", but no, they specifically say it has to either be available for pre-order or drop in a later charting week. Interesting. Taylor really seemed to enjoy the unleaked digital deluxe surprise game; I wonder if for TS12 she'll give up on it, move it to a follow-up week, or invent a new game to deliver surprises?",

That\u2019s when she sang I Did Something Bad (for the first time at Eras). Then she turned up in the U.S. with the new Rep outfit. Then she released the Eras book with \u201csee you next era.\u201d At the time I thought it was because of how well TTPD was selling, but now I think it\u2019s because she turned in new music.\n\nWe will see what iHeart brings! If she announces a tour doc, I\u2019ll still hold out for a TS 12 announcement, potentially with a release before the end of August for Grammys eligibility. There\u2019s also a possibility she\u2019ll do an Eras live album, but that will be expensive and I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t happen closer to tour or the original tour movie.\n\nThere\u2019s a very slim chance that her next tour will be a continuation of Eras, as if she releases TS12 she might drop the remaining rerecords on her next tour.\n\nSo many possibilities!

I\u2019ve said this before but I think she had originally planned on releasing Rep TV sometime in early 2024. After she met Travis and fell in love, she wanted to close the chapter of her life involving Joe/Matty and start fresh so she needed to release TTPD. \u00a0But like Midnights, she needed to give TTPD space to sell.\u00a0\n\nRep TV could still come if it comes soon because there isn\u2019t any active single for her right now so she might want something this summer. \u00a0 She waited 6 months between 1989 TV and TTPD. Six months after a May release would put TS12 into November. I wonder if she might want to release at least Rep TV before TS12 to prove she is still working on the re-records instead of waiting 3 years between the 4th and 5th re-records. \u00a0Tide of public opinion could turn if she doesn\u2019t show forward movement. If TS12 comes first in let\u2019s say August, that means Rep TV won\u2019t realistically come until summer/fall 2026 instead of both this year.\u00a0\n\nBut like TTPD, I think she\u2019s been inspired by the last 1.5 years with Travis so might have enough material to fill a specific chapter of her life so she might want to release it sooner leaving no gap for Rep TV. I could see her having a very sonically and topically cohesive love album without as much anxiety as she did on Lover ready to go already. \u00a0",

No, they made it all about the Karma remix and how Guess was better and had more streams or whatever (and I'm not saying Karma remix was a good song but I feel like fans should be celebrating their favourite artist's new song instead of dragging someone else down). When \"Brat Summer\" happened, people made it about Taylor and how no one was having a \"Tortured Poets Summer,\" which makes no sense considering it came out in April... oh, and TTPD is still clearly the more impactful album if the fans are still crying about it to this day. Even when Charli won a Grammy, her fans made it about Taylor, which is funny considering Charli has 3 and Taylor has 14. Last time I checked, 14 is more than 3",

I do think that is something her and her team would take in consideration. Personally i think that we get at least one TV before that though. She can still put out a rerecord and doc around the same time. I don't think they would pull focus from eachother. But that is just my opinion",

TS12 seems like a fresh start, and it's very important for a lot of reasons. One, it'll be her first album since reputation where she can just plan a tour solely for that album (since we all know the Eras Tour was conceived because she didn't get to tour Lover, the folkmore albums, and then obviously, Midnights). It'll be her first \"normal\" tour since rep tour. Second, it'll presumably be about Tayvis relationship (obviously not completely). No songs about Joe or Matty. She seems to be in a much happier relationship and the production of the album will definitely reflect that. Of course she'll still write sad songs but this will most likely her first happy album since Lover. And that's exactly why I think she's gonna release rep TV and Debut TV first. Closing off the rerecordings era so she can move onto the next era.",

I get a sense that she\u2019ll get to present album 12 however she wanted without thinking about how anyone else might perceive it, more so than ever; and hopefully through that she\u2019ll get to curate her fanbase to be more authentic to her (and to us who choose to stay :) ).\n\nSo that said, maybe releasing the final rerecords without \u201cseeing\u201d us will give enough space for us - and her - to just appreciate them for what they are and not necessarily need to over-dissect them.

I'm fully aware this is delusional and she is probably just enjoying an extended holiday with Travis....but what if it is?",

Coming up next seems to be Morgan Wallen (I'm the Problem), which must release before Jun 20, when he begins the album's tour.  It's probably coming out in April.  Chapelle Roan is entering an album cycle.  Her single \"The Giver\" comes out in August, so the album will probably be a few months after that, likely early October.   There are two possible drops.  Rihanna, on Def Jam, may also be releasing an album (she's mentioned that it exists in a big interview). The other question is Noah Kahan, who is due for a new album, but hasn't done the stuff that you associate with entering an album cycle. \n\nNotice that there seems to be a big gap opening for the summer...",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily likely, but more likely than I would\u2019ve said a few months ago: \n- she recently said (I think in the eras tour book or something?) something like she doesn\u2019t like to repeat the same thing twice. We\u2019re expecting the TVs because so far there\u2019s been a pattern of two TVs then a new album: fearless and red before midnights, then speak now and 1989 before TTPD. What if she said this to hint she\u2019s not going to repeat this pattern again?\n- I believe she\u2019s also stated before that she enjoys giving Easter eggs through her outfits. Her outfits from what I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t seem to consistently advertise Rep or Debut. Like occasionally she does wear black but she\u2019s also been wearing a lot of red and plaid I think. It might not indicate anything really though, other than she\u2019s not actively Easter egging a TV (in my opinion)\n- the last time (during the re-recording process) there\u2019s been this much time between an album release and the next album announcement was between Red TV and Midnights. So maybe she\u2019s trying to build that gap again to make space for new music and a full new era? Again it could be coincidental, she\u2019s been very in-focus with the tour and everything so she may just be trying to avoid \u2018over exposure\u2019.\n\nIt all could be nothing!

She was most likely able to release so soon after announcing because she had no lengthy promo rollout planned as the tour was still going (the poets set on tour was likely the main promo focus along with Fortnight video). I think Poets was handed in somewhere around late Oct/early Nov 2024. \n\nMidnights had promo from late September 2022 onward. The title reveals and a few appearances, but we didn't hear a single second of music until release night. Anti Hero video Oct 21, Bejeweled video Oct 25, Lavender video Jan 27, Karma video May 26. \n\nIt's hard to tell what a plan might be now without the tour in the background. Does she want to go long now that she has the space to do so or is there no need/want for a long rollout when sales show she does fine without them now. \n\nWe also know with Midnights, Folklore and Evermore that she can produce an album in as little as 6 weeks to 3 months, film at least 1-2 music videos and do a few performances. So time is hardly an issue when it comes down to it. \n\nBut she'd have to be handing in an album very soon if a mid to late year annoucement is likely. If we go by the VERY loose theory that 3 months is the minimum needed to plan a rollout or whatever, then if she submits the album in March, she could announce in June/July and release in Sept/Oct and get that sweet Christmas promo around the time of a second or third single release. \n\nBasically the further into the year we get, the less likely an announcement of any kind is coming for at least 2-3 months at any given time...especially since there hasn't been any concrete confirmation of album trajectory either, aside from one report saying she does want to release new music first before taking a break with Travis. Other than that no studio pics, no rumblings, no hints from other artists etc. it's radio silence compared to Poets where her studio trajectory was very evident. So she's either recording entirely in secret or she isn't recording yet.",

I think she might want to keep things under wraps more this time or maybe she has a different promo plan up her sleeve. \n\nHonestly, I like the radio silence right now and all of our speculation about the TVs or TS12, makes me feel excited hahah!

Otherwise, without a rerecord or TS12 by August, she could be out of the run for Grammys next year and she seems to enjoy the awards. iHeart announcement or AMAs announcement \ud83e\udd1e",

It\u2019s part of her new process. We\u2019ve had 3 months so far. We could have 3-6 more months of quiet or she comes back tomorrow at iHeart. \u00a0We\u2019ve had plenty of high alert events(award shows, tour milestones stops, etc.) get dashed so we temper our expectations much better now.\u00a0\n\nHaving said all that, I still think she announces something tomorrow. She\u2019s accepting an award for tour\u00a0of the century, so I expect her to attend. When she does accept that award, my expectation is that we\u2019ll get an announcement of the doc/concert film she was filming in Vancouver and elsewhere. It\u2019s always possible she announces the next re-recording which is probably Reputation TV so she has a potential radio single this summer. And if she really wants to cause chaos, she could do both.\u00a0",

It's important to note how Ihearts has been talking about the eras tour and Taylor. Yes Taylor is nominated for multiple awards. Last time she went though she got the icon(?) award (one of the special ones they're giving to lady Gaga and Mariah Carey this year). This time, Ihearts has reiterated they're honoring the eras tour as the tour of the century, not that they're giving her a special award for it.\u00a0On their promo pics they aren't listing her under the special awards, just that she is nominated. Feel like if she was confirmed as attending, she would be listed. All that to say although I'm 50/50 on her going, that doesn't exclude me thinking there could be something special Eras tour announced tomorrow (on social media or at the show). Especially since Taylor Nation already said they're doing the listening party to celebrate 2 years of the tour of the century tomorrow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puhhl1y0q2pe1.jpeg?width=645&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9da33936f9c8e0f6d35d6d8bfd882ef34096a46f",

It's not entirely out of the realm for her to have decided to push reputation by a year and also have an approximate announcement date picked out. I'm not dying on this hill tho because maybe she just wants to have a quiet break for a while and disappear and that's okay too!!!",

I'm still in the restaurant in the corner I haunt and relive those moments) and so I wasn't thinking about the next one yet because it seemed too soon.

It was packed with costume changes, era changes, tons of scenography - I actually think it would be nice (and easier for her of course) to have a slower-paced tour now, centered around one cohesive aesthetic, and without the need to do everything at once! Whatever comes I'm sat tho, if she wants to top The Eras Tour - I'm here for it too!",

She wrote songs backstage on her last tour and bosses at AEG have been told to prepare themselves for another tour in 2026.\"\n\nI think there is some sensationalism thrown into this article because AEG reps aren't going to hear the album so there seems to be some guessing that Blake is going to get some songs in addition to Travis(which is obvious to everyone).  \n\nI was leery about mentioning this originally because of the tabloid nature of the source.  But u/bubblecuffer13 commented that their friend, who works with the Eras staging company, sent them a cryptic text for 2026 so I decided to add it as another potential clue.",

If she was to drop the 2023 US Eras tour dates on top of the 2026 World Cup dates, the only date that would have been in conflict is the July 7/8th dates she did in Kansas City.  Seattle was on July 22/23 so she'd be unlikely to do that one as well.  It makes the scheduling more complicated but she could pretty much just do the same schedule and swap KC for St. Louis, for example.  If a city on East Coast can't do her tour, there is Baltimore, Cleveland, Washington, DC, Jacksonville, Carolina, etc. to pick up slack.  If the Texas stadiums become issue, New Orleans can do it.  The NFL made accommodations with her last year, so its possible she'd be able to schedule some of the west coast concerts during the season.",

With her popularity right now, I can totally see her thinking, \"let me get another one in while I still have them wrapped around my finger\" or however you want to phrase it. Further, she made it very clear the Eras tour was not a goodbye tour. If she wants kids for example, she might want to do another tour to squash any rumors that the Eras tour was a goodbye before going on a family hiatus.",

All of the Taylor's Version covers so far \"mirror\" the original covers with either the direction Taylor is facing or the placement of the album title writing.  \n3. Taylor's selection of the mirrorball performance from Glendale N1 could easily be a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that the Taylor's Versions are mirrors of the originals.  \n4. The original version of Reputation was announced on August 23 (or 8/23) 2017. That date mirrored is 3/28, March 28.  \n5. As many have already pointed out below, the track length for mirrorball is exactly 3:28.\n\nIt could be that all this is just a series of total coincidences and not intentional at all, but what if none of it was accidental? If we don't hear anything else in the next week, this probably means nothing and Taylor is still just enjoying her break. But if Taylor/TN start amping up the Reputation hints in the coming days, I think we should consider March 28 as a decent contender for a Rep TV announcement.",

If that's the case, I feel like this general idea still has to be on her radar - with all the connections and mentoring she's done with other artists, I would loove a Taylor-led festival that also really highlighted these other artists. I get the feeling that Taylor ultimately takes the \"more cake\" view when it comes to other artists - the more great music in the world, the better (which is also why I think the talk of her \"blocking\" other artists' releases or whatever is silly), and even better if she can support female artists in a sometimes brutal often misogynistic industry/world. Plus I think with Taylor's creative & monetary resources, she could help the other artists put on the show of their wildest dreams!!",

                    "body": "Taylor Swift is a business sure.  But she's also a person.  Not everything she does is optimal from a marketing perspective!  And she's 35.  Her career, in various forms, is going to last for thirty more years.  During that time she will be more popular, and she will be less popular.  But focusing on maintaining a level of attention that she's had for the past two years... is counterproductive. \n\nAnd she's arrived at a weird position in her career...  Let's think about Taylor Swift as a business for a second. \n\nArtists like Taylor have four major sources of income:  recorded music, touring, merch, and brand partnerships (advertising).  Taylor unusually doesn't do much brand partnership anymore (she did when she was younger).   She makes so much from music and touring that the added risk of diluting her brand hawking \"makeup and magazines\" doesn't really make much sense.  And what she does she generally connects to her other businesses (her capital one deal for instance is tour sponsorship).  Taylor also does a huge merch business, but that's highly connected to touring (though she also significant d2c merch sales).  \n\nTouring is taylor's income source, by far.  She generated in past two years about a billion dollars total in recorded music revenues (including publishing) worldwide.  The eras tour had 2 billion in ticket sales, something above 300 million in merch sales (including the book), 300 million in movie sales... and an unknown amount in endorsement income.  So something 3/4 of her income these past two years is due to touring, despite the fact that she also had probably the biggest recording artist years that there has ever been.  Now, touring is weird, because as Beyonce is demonstrating, its very easy to saturate the market.  Part of the reason for the explosiveness of the Era's Tour was that Taylor hadn't toured in five years.  It's better for her to be quiet, and then come back in a few years from the point of view of touring.\n\nMusic is the opposite.  Music is really where artists need to actively promote themselves (and endorsement, but Taylor doesn't do that much).  But its only a minority of her income... and as she gets older, its going to be a smaller and smaller minority.  Taylor is of a generation of artists that releases music to sell tours.  But... her catalog is so big now, and so generally that she doesn't need to do that anymore!  She could have billion dollar tours for the rest of her life never releasing another song.  Hell, she could easilly do another 40 song tour like eras, with a totally different set of songs!\n\nObviously Taylor is going to continue to release music... but that music is commercially mostly irrelevant.  In fact... how much money did Taylor actually make from TTPD?  Well... you'd think a ton... because it sold a ton of units, but her total sales didn't really increase that much.  In fact, she sold about the same number of records in 2024 and she did in 2023.  So in some sense... TTPD didn't do much!  Now I think Taylor is going to continue to release music, because that's who she is, but there's no particular reason to care very much about its commercial performance (besides the fact that she's a responsible artist).  \n\nTLDR...  Taylor doesn't really need to market herself anymore.  She's still going to, but in a conflict between her life and her marketing?  Her life should, and I think it's becoming clear will, win out.",

I can see her going for most of this year without releasing anything.\u00a0\n\nPlus\u2026 the tour was a lot.

It\u2019s usually a combination of those factors. \u00a0It\u2019s hard to predict because voter splitting often leads to weird results. The artists don\u2019t know who is going to win ahead of time.\u00a0\n\nBillboard is purely based on how well the artist/song/album charted on the Billboard charts. Most of the time we, the audience, knows who the winner is ahead of time. The artists know ahead of time as well.\u00a0\n\nThe AMAs is a popularity contest. Fans vote so the biggest fan bases, like Swifties, can flood the poll and make sure their favorite artist wins. The artists knows they won before they attended.\u00a0\n\niHeart music award nominations are determined by radio performance. Voting for nominees is based on fan voting so biggest fan bases win. Winners know before they attend.\u00a0\n\nVMAs is focused on music videos. Fans vote so again biggest fan bases tend to win. Winner knows they won before they attend.\u00a0",

Before announcing TTPD, Taylor\u2019s website showed a screen saying \u201cError: 321 Backend fetch failed\u201d. Number aside, \u201cbackend fetch failed\u201d is an actual official error statement: It tells you that the information you\u2019re requesting can\u2019t be retrieved from the main server storing it, often when the server is *overloaded* with requests.\n\nI think it\u2019s possible this is less of an Easter egg, and more of a metaphor for Rep TV not able to be released at the time. Perhaps there\u2019ve been logistical issues behind the scenes, perhaps the process of revisiting/revamping her old songs suddenly became more demanding than worthwhile, who knows.\n\nWhatever her reasons are for her to know, and not for me to claim to know. But what I do think is that error screen may have been a way for her/her team to state that the last TVs won\u2019t come out the way people have hoped/clowned for. That perhaps she just needs more time and space to work through anything she needs to, and determine what priorities feel best for her right now :). I think little eggs - like the snake necklace from last night\u2019s iHeart acceptance video - appear just to let us know the rerecords are still on the table; but there won\u2019t be an obvious *nor* cryptic timeline for us to know just yet. I think whenever she\u2019s truly ready, she\u2019ll let us know, on her own terms :).\n\nThat all said, all of you who enjoy clowning, clown away :D! I just wanted to share this for those who may be feeling confused or burntout from continuous clowning, in case it helps put anything in perspective :).",

But where it can be a clue is the\u00a0reason\u00a0the inactivity exists.\n\n\u00a0Since\u00a0Reputation\u2019s release, the longest hiatus from an Instagram post was between December 27th 2021(Red TV 22 promo) and March 22nd 2022 when she promoted Carolina. But between December 27th and August 28, 2022(Midnights announcement)\u00a0she only posted about three things - Carolina, This Love TV for Summer I Turned Pretty, and her Honorary Doctorate.\u00a0\n\nSo for Midnights, she disappeared which created a lot of anticipation amongst the fan base that kept building because so little was coming. \u00a0So when the announcement finally came it was super exciting and built massive hype. This hype was elevated further by the tour announcement. \u00a0So she might be pulling from same playbook for next album especially if she doesnt announce an album at iHeart. She might announce whatever she was filming in Canada but then go largely quiet for 3-6 more months.\u00a0",

Coming off a 2-year world tour, Taylor probably wants some downtime to rest and relax now. It also gives the general public some time to miss her so they\u2019re excited when she announces her next release, instead of experiencing \u201cTaylor fatigue\u201d or comments that she\u2019s overexposed",

TTPD had such strife outside the fan base because of all the hoopla surrounding her attendance at Chiefs' games.  Without the game attendance, I imagine the Metacritic score would have been 10 points higher.\n\nI think she just wanted to take a few months to decompress after the Eras Tour.  She doesn't post when she doesn't have a project and she doesn't right now so quiet isn't that suspicious.    But she isn't the kind of person who can sit still for too long so I imagine she has begun working on two or three projects again.

We\u2019ve already passed February this year. So February, 2026?\n\nAt the very end of the video (which happens to be the Karma video), the hand on the clock moves from 11 and strikes 12. I know everyone assumed that was just a nod to Midnights at the time, but 11 and 12 are between the blue nail and the black nail.\n\n1989 TV announcement in August 2023, TS11/TTPD last year, TS12/Karma this year, Rep TV announcement in February 2026?\n\nThat\u2019s completely unhinged (because I know she couldn\u2019t have planned for folklore and evermore - let alone TTPD - all the way back in 2019 when The Man MV was released), but I had to get it off my chest. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nBut she DID say TTPD had been in the works for 2 years by the time it was announced, and it\u2019s entirely possible she came up with the 2023 coffee cup clock egg by the time she knew TTPD would be TS11 and retroactively tied it all back to the 2019 placement of Karma on the album wall. \ud83e\udee0",

Her relationship with Matty is unique for her because it was a relationship that festered in the background for almost 10 years that she built up in her mind just to have it all fall apart. That would generate a lot of feelings and inspire.\u00a0\n\nJoe, on other hand,\u00a0had been around for almost 7 years. There was plenty of time to process her emotions over time. \u00a0If rumors are to be believed, their relationship died slowly over years. So although not specifically about Joe, many of her feelings about her breakup with Joe are sprinkled throughout folklore, evermore, and Midnights.\u00a0\n\nAnd I\u2019d say Taylor has a history of not matching song count with relationship length. \u00a0Calvin Harris being the biggest outlier. \u00a0As far as I know, he has only a few songs where he is factored in at all and that relationship was a year.\n\n\u00a0I think Taylor might hold back on releasing songs if she still has love for the muse. It\u2019s possible she wrote about some negative emotions she had for Joe near end by attributing them to Matty. \u00a0 We have no way to know for sure.\u00a0\n\nIn similar vein, I\u2019ve seen some theories Dear John could be about Martin Johnson instead of John Mayer but Taylor wanted people to think it was about someone else so John Mayer was easy target. \u00a0I think Mayer threatened to sue about it during original SN release because it wasn\u2019t about him but backed off at the time. \u00a0A rumor goes that Mayer or his team contacted Taylor\u2019s team to threaten them again after the abuse and threats that Gyllenhaal went through when Red TV was released. \u00a0The specter of a trial was why before Taylor played Dear John on Eras tour that she gave the speech trying to diffuse the crazier Swifties plan to harass John Mayer.\u00a0",

Anyone??\n\n1. In the feed, there\u2019s this little picture of someone. Who is that?? It has come and gone since I first noticed it (approx 1am US Central Time). When I started writing this post, it was there. All of the sudden, it\u2019s not.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hliznulc8ipe1.jpeg?width=318&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=461dc4f03acb894414f6d522019921fcf8759d46\n\n2. You know when you click to open a story, that little colorful circle around the profile picture turns while the story loads? Well Taylor Nation\u2019s story takes a noticeably long time to load.\n\n3. Once it does load, it\u2019s a black screen with that same loading circle, but it\u2019s white. It circles for a few seconds, stops, then there\u2019s a replay button so you can watch it again.\n\n4. Is all of this a nod back to all the other technology \u201cglitches\u201d we\u2019ve seen, especially the Error 321? Are we on standby for an Insta announcement? Does it have something to do with that lady I previously mentioned?\n\n5. When you see that rotating circle in white against a black background it screams Rep\u2026 and it looks like a snake circling.\n\nI cannot believe I didn\u2019t take a screenshot because it\u2019s all gone now.",

Bye Bye Baby is the most dramatically changed from the demo - it was originally called One Thing and the lyrics were overhauled so much the name had to change. The rest of the lyric changes between demos and released versions are extremely minor (the outro of Forever Winter, for example, was originally, \"he says, why fall in love, I say, cuz I won't go away\"; the released version is \"I say, believe in one thing, I won't go away\") \n\nI would also point out that we don't know *when* these lyrics changed. It's possible she changed them for the TV recordings. It's also entirely possible she changed them years ago after recording the original demos. There's a studio demo of Tim McGraw with a completely different bridge that changes the whole tone of the song, for example. Who knows?",
