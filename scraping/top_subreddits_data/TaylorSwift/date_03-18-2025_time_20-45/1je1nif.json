Bless you all for showing such honesty and courage, I wish you nothing but peace and happiness. \u2764",

For background info we\u2019ve been together for two years now and I was 28 when we started dating and my parents did everything to keep me away from him including trying to give me a curfew and grounding me. They took my car keys and hid them so I couldn\u2019t go see him (he just came to me until I found them) so the lyric \u201cI\u2019d rather burn my whole life down than listen to one more second of this bitching and moaning\u201d is very much what happened.

Family pictures, family vacations, family parties. I\u2019m never invited and have to find out from my sisters. If I wanted to know anything about their lives, I have to drag it out of him\n\n\u201cAlways taking up too much space or time\u201d - this one has a more literal meaning, of how I not only became a burden when he\u2019d have to drive me to school or if I asked him to go do something, but I also took up \u201ctoo much space\u201d as in him and my stepmom started telling me I was overweight when I was 12 (I was not and am still not close to overweight)\n\n\u201cYou assume I\u2019m fine\u201d - he has NEVER seen how I feel let alone asked how I feel about anything. I\u2019m always fine. \n\n\u201cWhat would you do if I break free and leave us in ruins\u201d - I moved out and stopped trying to be the one keeping our relationship in tact and it\u2019s fallen apart\n\n\u201cTook this dagger in me and removed it\u201d - he doesn\u2019t have control over me anymore and that pisses him off so badly he can\u2019t stand it. He can\u2019t stand that I don\u2019t live for him or his approval anymore\n\n\u201cGain the weight of you then lose it, believe me I could do it\u201d - I took on the emotional and physical burden of him for so long and I broke free. I\u2019m so much healthier and happier and safer now. And the believe me I could do it part has always been a line inspiring me to keep going, to keep that distance as long as I need to. \n\n\u201cI know my love should be celebrated, but you tolerate it\u201d - everything I\u2019ve ever done for him and to appease him is incredible, but it\u2019s never enough. So I\u2019ve moved on and I celebrate myself now and surround myself with people who celebrate me instead of him\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk",

Then Speak Now was released, I had just turned 14 at that point, and I didn't know the story with Kanye and Taylor, I had been a Swiftie since Fearless but I wasn't active in the fandom. I didn't even know who Kanye West was to be honest. So I listened to Speak Now for the first time and there was this song called Innocent. And there were so many lines which I connected to being stuck, being caught in the web that is anorexia, namely \"I guess you really did it this time, lost yourself in your war path, lost your balance on a tight rope, lost your mind trying to get it back\" and then there were those lines that told me that recovery might be possible like \"it's alright, just wait and see, your string of lights is still bright to me\" or \"time turns flames to embers, you'll have new Septembers, everyone of us has messed up, too. minds change like the weather, I hope you remember, today is never too late to be brand new\". In January 2011, I went inpatient, and I listened to Innocent multiple times each day, and it was what kept me going, what made me choose recovery and life over anorexia. So for me, this song is about recovery, about feeling stuck but having hope to get through it and to get out if it. It is still my favourite song, I love it with all my heart and for me, it has such beautifully written lines and one of the best bridges.",

Also the verse \u201cI knew you\u2019d come back to me\u201d relates so much with when I started accepting and loving who I am. I don\u2019t know how to explain, may not make much sense, but it\u2019s my favorite song because of that.",
