This survey will be added to our wiki page, in the sidebar, and at the top of the subreddit.\n\nOpen the images in a new tab for the best viewing experience!\n\n**A few notable items:**\n\n* Our average age increased to 29 this year. We have been steadily increasing over the last few years.\n* We have two new entries into our Top 10 songs, cowboy like me and exile, both of which were just outside the Top 10 in 2023. Cruel Summer and Champagne Problems dropped out of the Top 10 this year\n* The top songs on TTPD have shuffled around quite a bit from the original TTPD survey, however the bottom songs remained pretty consistent.\n\n**One question missing from the graphics is tour outfits/costumes, so I'll provide you some info here!**\n\n* Eras themed outfits were the most common to wear to the Eras Tour. Lover, reputation, evermore, Midnights, and TTPD were the most popular eras.\n* Many people also wore costumes based on past tours or Eras Tour costumes. The most popular were the Red T-shirts, Lover Bodysuits, Midnights Bodysuits, and 1989 Tour outfits!\n* Some of the most unique outfits: A traffic light, The Black Dog, The Catnip Bottle from Cats, Lime Green Dog, and a Kimono painted for all the eras\n\n**For everyone who wanted the albums in a stacked bar chart -**  \n*(I also don't like the Taylor's Versions broken out)*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2isofbakp7le1.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbef062156ddcb694afe001baaf90b35a9dbd5ef\n\nLet us know your thoughts!",

For all but *1989*, it\u2019d still be between 2% and 7%. Only *1989* would be competitive with her more recent releases, and it is still sizably losing to *reputation*, *folklore*, and *evermore*.

I knew it was a popular album, but I wonder if it maybe got so many votes because of the anticipation for RepTV's release? The survey demographic skews younger and many of the responders are international, so that could also explain why her older country sound might not be as popular.",

So much work must have been put into it.\u00a0\n\n\nI loved reading the data and I think the one thing that stood out to me the most is how favorable the rating reputation got !! A few years ago, in this sub it was rated average to low. I guess the performances may have helped increasing its rank. Strangely, Lover who was also very divisive a few years ago doesn't seem to have its ranking changed that much \ud83e\udd14 You'd think Cruel Summer at least would impact its position. But then again reputation seems at least to have cohesion and less number of songs over Lover who still get criticized for its wild tracklisting and length (TTPD laughs in the corner).\u00a0\n\n\nAnyways, I wonder how much these answers will change once all the re-recordings will be out and one day when TS12 will be released. It's so interesting because I've been a fan of Taylor for almost 15 years now and the opinions of the fan base have continuously changed over time. Although, one thing that has managed to remain consistent is All Too Well. It's safe to say that song has cemented its place and probably will never be taken from it.\u00a0",

Some people consider casual fan and Swiftie as one in the same and others see a difference between them, so I think that's what's going on.",

It seems that every other person you meet has been a Swiftie since 2006\u2026 when she was minuscule compared to the heights she reached even a few years later and most of us were either in diapers or at least too young to make music consumption choices. \n\nWhy do so many people feel the need to lie about this?? Taylor is now almost two decades into her career, there\u2019s no shame in being a new Swiftie or even a Swiftie of 10~ years.",
