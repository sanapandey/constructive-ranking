Currently they are both with different partners, but know each other as \"neighbors\".\n\nIn the second verse, after all that depression in the endless February. She takes the \"miracle move on drug\" - implying she decided to end that relationship she was depressed in, return that old flame as a rebound, but the effect was temporary - it did not last long. That's the second fortnight they spend together. That short term relationship feels like its ruining her life, but when it happened, it felt like it's forever.\n\nIn the outro, he is ghosting her. She is trying to call him but he wont pick up, she is trying to move to Florida (Florida is a metaphor for that relationship that is used as an escape - as we know from Florida!!!), but he is not interested in her anymore so it was \"**another fortnight lost**\".",

Her \"husband\" that is cheating is Matty. These parts are more about the emotional metaphors than literal.\n\n\"I love you, its ruining my life,\" because she can't have him anymore.

About a woman who may or may not have cheated on her husband.  Musically the entire song is a single crescendo culminating in the explosive outro, which corresponds lyrically to a series of revelations about what's going on in the woman's psyche.\n\nIn some sense the story is pretty banal... it's a woman who is bored in her marriage so fantasizes about sleeping with her neighbor and escaping with him to florida while her husband is away (for a fortnight).  But the emotional intensity of the song lies in that \"but I touched you... for only a fortnight. I touched you. I touched you!\"\n\nAnd it's not entirely clear that the object of the song is even real... or is a ghostly figment of the singers imagination.\n\nAt least that's how I read it.\n\n  \nAlso it has a ton of gorgious lyrics. \"all my mornings are mondays stuck in an endless february\".  Notice the clever semi-rhyme in \"move to \\*florida\\*, buy the \\*car you want\\*, but it \\*won't start up\\*\"",

But that was the point of the tour, to be able to tour the 5 albums she hadn\u2019t toured for prior as well as including some of her older albums she toured for. But the surprise song set were two* different songs every night or more depending on what she did. I don\u2019t think two surprise songs sets are the same through the entire tour. I personally got to hear a song she didn\u2019t do on any other dates at all, even in a mashup.",
