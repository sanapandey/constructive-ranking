    "selftext": "In honor of the 2 year anniversary of the eras tour starting, I wanted to ask yall if there are any songs that you prefer the eras tour version over the original, or if you prefer an eras tour mashup over the original full length song? I\u2019m sure this has been asked before but I can\u2019t find the thread so sorry for the repeat \u2764\ufe0f. Personally, the mashup between the prophecy and long story short made me appreciate long story short so much more and i can only listen to the eras acoustic version. What about you guys? Honorable mention for me is thanK u aIMee x mean (i get teary eyed everytime i hear the crowd recognize mean and sing along so loud) \ud83e\udef6\n\nEdit: thank u guys so much for replying!! I love hearing all your favs. I don\u2019t have any friends that are ts fans this has been so nice to interact with you guys \ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6",
