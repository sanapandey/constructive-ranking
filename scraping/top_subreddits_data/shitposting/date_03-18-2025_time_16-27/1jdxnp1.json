I don't think anyone argued against this fact. I guess another way to say it is that she \n\"unintentionally jerked him off\"?\n\nThe root of the argument was whether or not Yoru was actively/intentionally moving her hands, which \nnothing in 167/168 seems to indicate that. There was no movement lines around Denji's pants area, and no \nsound effect text to indicate sound coming from the movement in his pants.\n\nAlso, the editor's note at the end of chapter 167 is \"\u4e0d\u610f\u306e \u653e\u51fa\", which means \"Unexpected release\". It \nwouldn't really make much sense for Yoru to be surprised when Denji finally did ejaculate if that was \nher intention.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So many poor children were injured in the crash, but was worse: many of them saw the image. This is all your fault.

Some of us thought it would be fun to agree with some of the dumber people and then defend them from others who weren't getting the joke. So we did that every day after school. It never really stuck and was all fun-and-games till facebook became public. All of a sudden the people we were joking with found each other and started reaffirming their ideas. The proofs they would come up with were more hyperbolic than anything we ever imagined, but they believed it. We created an ideological monster from humor, lies and suspicion. You other apes know who you are. It was funny at first and we were all pissin ourselves laughing. But this is the end result. We've successfully corrupted generations through trolling. Why does this feeling of success feel so hollow. We did it guys... They actually believe it now. Now with everything going on it feels like we contributed to the downfall of society in our own way, and I'm not sure if there is a way to fix it.",
