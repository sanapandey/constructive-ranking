            "body": "Used to be depressed before I saw how connected everything was\n\nI literally cannot name a \"bad\" thing that has happened to me that hasn't led me to good eventually\n\nFor example my mother passed when I was very young, yet it was the best thing that could have happened to me\n\nAs I grew up and matured I began to realize just how miraculous it was to have a house, food, water, entertainment, friends, family, etc\n\nI became much more grateful\n\nI also realized most of my \"depression\" was actually just me  dealing with negative thought patterns. I stopped listening to the voice in my head when it would say fucked up shit lol\n\nAnother huge thing people don't wanna admit is that they probably aren't doing what's best for themselves. You'll be less depressed if you stop drinking alcohol and start working out for example but it's tough putting in effort from a place of sadness\n\nIt's weird because becoming \"happy\" only takes shifts in perspective but your depressed ego tries to tell you it's impossible. For whatever reason if you're depressed for long enough it becomes \"comfortable\" for you and that is your normal state of mind because that's what you're used to.\n\nIt took a while to realize happiness was a state of mind as well. Lots of people attach \"happy\" to material gains. As in \"I'll be happy when I get my mansion or girlfriend\". And that shit is always only temporary and not very useful because the ego will always want more more more! Gotta be happy with what you have and God takes care of the rest\n\nLast thing I'll say is sometimes the biggest tragedies are actual miracles in disguise. Next time something fucked up happens try and take a different perspective and see how it might be setting you up for future stuff! Black Sabbath can't write War Pigs without war lol",

There's this individual, a character so suspicious that they practically have \"Shady McShaderson\" written all over them. They've slithered into my messages like a sneaky little snake, and they've done something truly outrageous. They've sent me a message, a message filled with dubious vibes, and within that message, they've included a link. A link that looks as suspicious as a cat in a dog park \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude05\n\nNow, I know I can be a bit too trusting, maybe even a tad gullible \ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71, but my spidey senses are tingling. This shady stranger is practically radiating sketchiness. Their message is like a neon sign flashing \"SCAM ALERT!\" But, being the cautious and curious person that I am, I thought I'd turn to you all for advice. Should I click on this incredibly suspicious link? I mean, it\u2019s just a little hunch I have that this might not be entirely safe. What do you think? Could it possibly, maybe, potentially be a scam? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\nI need some enlightenment here, folks! I'm on the edge of my seat, heart pounding, palms sweaty, hoping you'll provide some wisdom before I make any rash decisions! What say you? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",
