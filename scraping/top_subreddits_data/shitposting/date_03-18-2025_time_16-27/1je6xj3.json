That is what this post is to me. \n\nAOL used to send you free drink coasters that you could pop into your disk drive and have access to chatting with so many random people. Some of us thought it would be fun to agree with some of the dumber people and then defend them from others who weren't getting the joke. So we did that every day after school. It never really stuck and was all fun-and-games till facebook became public. All of a sudden the people we were joking with found each other and started reaffirming their ideas. The proofs they would come up with were more hyperbolic than anything we ever imagined, but they believed it. We created an ideological monster from humor, lies and suspicion. You other apes know who you are. It was funny at first and we were all pissin ourselves laughing. But this is the end result. We've successfully corrupted generations through trolling. Why does this feeling of success feel so hollow. We did it guys... They actually believe it now. Now with everything going on it feels like we contributed to the downfall of society in our own way, and I'm not sure if there is a way to fix it.",

That         \nis when my eyes truly opened to the genius that is Kendrick Lamar Duckworth, I saw a black gentlemen \nlistening to Not Like Us, and tears fell down from my eyes as I finally realized the impact that \nKendrick has made, he truly was what the culture was feeling.\n\nI went up to the fellow Kendrick enthusiast and saluted him for being on the right side of history. He \nwas for some reason very confused as to why a crying man was saluting him so I decided to show him that \nI am indeed \"certified\" by rapping Not Like Us to him \"WOP WOP WOP DOT FUCK EM UP\" I shouted \"WOP WOP \nWOP IMMA DO MY STUFF\" I continued, \"WHY YOU TROLLING LIKE A BITCH AINT YOU TIRED\" I took a breath, \n\"TRYNA STRIKE A CHORD AND ITS PROBABLY A MINORRRRR\" I exclaimed.

                            "body": "I'm so fucking sick of normalized racism against Indians\n\nPreface:\n\nMy parents are immigrants from India and moved to the US before starting a family.They've done nothing \nbut hard work from day one. We don't have a perfect relationship, but they gave up everything back home \nto start a new life here. I have so many feelings of hatred, anger, resentment, and frustration because \nof the way people treat me and my family for being Indian. What I think is actually truly insane is that \nI also live in a heavily Asian area, and even other Asians AND EVEN OTHER SOUTH ASIANS have it out for     \nus.\n\nI'm so sick and tired of people acting like they've never seen an Indian in their life, especially since \nI'm from an area with a lot of Indians. I swear to fucking god racism against Indians is so fucking \nnormalized that other races get away with treating me like garbage. Unironically, it's actually been \nWhite people who've been the least racist to me. This breaks my heart, I can't keep stressing enough \nthat I'm from a diverse area.\n\nLet me give a few personal anecdotes:\n\n\"Does your mom cook Indian food?\" ok this isn't that bad to be honest, but the context was about how \nIndian people smell bad and the food is disgusting, and the tone used felt incredibly derogatory.\n\n\"Don't worry, you're one of the good Indians because you don't smell\" Thanks bud, that's not the \ncompliment you think it is. Then this person proceeded to shit on Indians for being smelly. Let me be \nclear, I understand there is a hygeine problem in India. But what I don't understand is you acting like \nthat changes anything about who I am as a person.\n\n\"[My] parents aren't even citizens. There's nothing to be proud about\" This one isn't bad either but it \nmakes my blood boil. There's just no context either.\n\nLet's talk about another problem. Social media.\n\nBefore anyone tells me, just close Instagram, tiktok, youtube etc that's not going to change the social \nmedia makeup and I try to stay off social media.\n\nI've seen so much hatred against Indians it's genuinely making me unhappy. EVERY SINGLE RACE doesn't \nfind us attractive, even other Indians. I've seen so much hate against Indian from other South Asian \naccounts which I don't think even makes sense, a lot of us share so much DNA and even some parts of \nculture? Maybe they just have a superiority complex or wtv. If I named bad aspects about cultures/races \nthat don't like us, I would be cancelled and I would be sent so much hate. I'm tired of this, honestly. \nGenuinely, it's mostly always other POC who have it out for us from my own experiences.\n\nI've also seen so many posts that cherry pick shitty street food, and even non-Indians who visit that \ntry to make posts about actual good parts of our culture are shit on and are left behind in favor of \nthose who only cherry pick bad parts about street food, culture, etc.\n\nI'm tired of nobody talking about this. I'm tired of people sweeping this under the rug. I'm sorry that \nCanada is filled with Indians, but that's not my problem and that's your governments problem, not Indian \npeople. I don't get what you guys get from all of this, but all you're doing is making people miserable \nand thriving off of hate. It's the same people who cry wolf when racism is extended to other races. Of \ncourse though, I guess Indian people have become so successful people don't like us because they won't \nbe us.\n\nedit: jk i take back what i said about white people not being as racist. i see the racist white \n(canadians \nand eastern europeans) ppl coming into the comments now, y'all are all bark no bite and social media has \nmade u way too comfortable with your racism lmao\n\ndirecting your hate to random indians are not going to change your countries' immigration policies\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't think anyone argued against this fact. I guess another way to say it is that she \n\"unintentionally jerked him off\"?\n\nThe root of the argument was whether or not Yoru was actively/intentionally moving her hands, which \nnothing in 167/168 seems to indicate that. There was no movement lines around Denji's pants area, and no \nsound effect text to indicate sound coming from the movement in his pants.\n\nAlso, the editor's note at the end of chapter 167 is \"\u4e0d\u610f\u306e \u653e\u51fa\", which means \"Unexpected release\". It \nwouldn't really make much sense for Yoru to be surprised when Denji finally did ejaculate if that was \nher intention.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is what this post is to me. \n\nAOL used to send you free drink coasters that you could pop into your disk drive and have access to chatting with so many random people. Some of us thought it would be fun to agree with some of the dumber people and then defend them from others who weren't getting the joke. So we did that every day after school. It never really stuck and was all fun-and-games till facebook became public. All of a sudden the people we were joking with found each other and started reaffirming their ideas. The proofs they would come up with were more hyperbolic than anything we ever imagined, but they believed it. We created an ideological monster from humor, lies and suspicion. You other apes know who you are. It was funny at first and we were all pissin ourselves laughing. But this is the end result. We've successfully corrupted generations through trolling. Why does this feeling of success feel so hollow. We did it guys... They actually believe it now. Now with everything going on it feels like we contributed to the downfall of society in our own way, and I'm not sure if there is a way to fix it.",
