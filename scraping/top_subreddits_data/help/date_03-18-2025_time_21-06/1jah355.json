    "selftext": "Welcome back to another Weekly Recap, where I recap the week that was and boy, was that a week! Let's see what happened! (I wonder if it would be shorter if I went over what didn't happen. Hmmm)\n\n**NEWS AND ISSUES**\n\n* In the [changelog](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/35343974642452-Changelog-March-6-2025) from last week, it stated that the sorting bug had been fixed. Turns out, yes and no! I followed up with the team in charge of that and they got to work on deploying a fix. Shout out to u/domonono for bringing this up and for providing a screen recording!\n\n* There was an issue with low resolution images in comments. We replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1j7ol3z/android_why_are_all_the_images_in_comments/mh0p1cr/?share_id=QPyC_6gJuePFa7x4MAs5c&context=3) when there was a fix!\n\n* Also had an issue on Android with profile pages not loading. There was a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1j86z05/unable_to_view_profile_pageandroid/) that a dev replied to and this got worked on. Thanks to all who reported!\n\n* Comment deletion was broken for a hot minute on Friday. That got fixed right on up.  \n\n* Level Ten Helper u/jgoja mentioned that you can add subreddits to custom feeds from the iOS app again, so that's also fixed! Thanks so much for pointing that out!\n\n* Annnnddddd the subreddit sorting not sticking was fixed, right up until you made a post and then it unstuck itself and went back to something else. Say it with me: ARRRGGGHHH. But the team is working on this and I'm hopeful that it will be fixed before the end of next week. Apologies that this is still a frustrating experience. \n\n* **EDIT**: In a late development, Reddit announced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/1jalkya/introducing_hide_an_ad/) that starting this week, users will be able to HIDE AN AD even if they don't have Premium! This has been asked for since the beginning of time and now it's a thing! \n\n**FOLLOW UP ON PREVIOUS ISSUES**\n\n* Turning off Autoplay on Android does not apply to Community Highlights. This finally got looked at and is on their radar, but unfortunately, there is a bit of a backlog, so this is on the back burner for a little while. No estimate as to when it might be fixed, but I'll keep checking on it. Many apologies to u/ChimpyChompies who initially brought this to my attention! \n\n**BUGS ROUND UP - COMPLIMENTS OF ME (which is why it's a little short this week lol)**\n\n* [Android] Can't view custom feed - This is known and should be fixed up soon \n\n* [Android] Flair not updating - Should be fixed in the current version\n\n* [iOS] Posts not showing up when sorted by new - Under continued investigation. Sneaky bug! \n\n* [Desktop] Three dot menu on comments broken - This was reported Wednesday and ~~a fix was on the way~~ is fixed!  (Thank you, Rostingu2!) \n\n**ONGOING ISSUES**\n\n* If your account gets the \"server error\" banner or you can't update your profile, I can fix that sometimes! **I cannot fix accounts where you are receiving the \"server error\" message and are unable to view content from that account when logged out.** In those instances, you will need to file an appeal. Just let me know and I'll take a look and get you all taken care of! Please note that I cannot give any information or assist with any account unless contacted directly from that account.\n\n* If no one else can see your posts or comments across Reddit (not just in one sub) and you are unable to post here in r/help, you can file an appeal [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232). \n\n* Please check the [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/) to see if you can find the answer to your question there. Also, check this sub for stickied posts regarding outages and downtime. \n\n* If your account is marked as NSFW and it is not NSFW, you can check out [this Help Center article](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043471131-Why-was-my-profile-marked-as-Not-Safe-for-Work-NSFW-and-how-can-I-change-it) for information on how to change it back. If you're unable to change it back, feel free to make a post and one of the best helpers on Reddit will help me help you!\n\n**WEEKLY STATISTICS**\n\nMy tool for calculating how many posts and comments has broken! I am upset! I'm going to try and figure that out today and I can update this part if I get it working soon. Sorry about that! (It's kinda become one of my favorite parts of this thing.) But there were still over 1.3 million views, which is up about 57k from last week. Our sweet spot had been about 1.2 million, but here we are at 1.3 million! People know that this is the place! \n\n**TOP ISSUES**\n\n* **[Why did I receive a warning for \"Upvoting content encouraging violence\"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j6gh0q/why_did_i_receive_a_reddit_warning_for_upvoting/)**\n\nA user received a warning for upvoting content that encouraged violence and they were wondering why. Reddit posted about a new policy over in r/redditsafety [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/1j4cd53/warning_users_that_upvote_violent_content/). From that post \"*users who, within a certain timeframe, upvote several pieces of content banned for violating our policies will begin to receive a warning. We have done this in the past for quarantined communities and found that it did help to reduce exposure to bad content, so we are experimenting with this sitewide.*\"\n\nI know there are strong opinions about this and it would be great if you could leave constructive feedback and criticism in that post that is still being monitored! As always, I'm happy to pass along constructive feedback to the correct team, but having everything all in one place like that post would be ideal. \n\n* **[Why won't Reddit stop showing me India subs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j79vtv/why_wont_reddit_stop_showing_me_india_subs/)**\n\nA user was repeatedly seeing content that was related to India. This can happen sometimes and while it's not intentional, it can be frustrating. There was some good advice in that post. Helpingest Helper u/Rostingu2 suggested [muting the communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j79vtv/why_wont_reddit_stop_showing_me_india_subs/mgv3wy1/). u/starrae [suggested turning off home feed recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j79vtv/why_wont_reddit_stop_showing_me_india_subs/mgv9ogu/). Resident mod and pro helper u/ChimpyChompies directed the user to make sure the [location sort](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j79vtv/why_wont_reddit_stop_showing_me_india_subs/mgx0qow/) is set to 'everywhere'.  And u/FreeChickenDinner chimed in with a suggestion to check your [localization settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j79vtv/why_wont_reddit_stop_showing_me_india_subs/mgwjgn4/). \n\n* **[Post restrictions wouldn't allow me to post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j8uzg0/my_work_was_wasted_because_of_post_restrictions/)**\n\nA user spent a lot of time on a post and then was unable to post it in the sub that they were in because they did not meet the posting requirements. Some subreddits will have minimum karma or account age requirements as a way of combating spam and trolls. You can message the mods of the sub and ask them if they will approve your content, though they are not obligated to do so. You can also participate in subreddits that do not have those requirements to gain some karma. r/casualconversation is great for that! And if you\u2019re looking for a subreddit on a particular topic and aren\u2019t quite sure what it would be, you can try posting in r/findareddit and someone there may have a suggestion for you.\n\n**WEEKLY HELPINGEST HELPERS HELPING R/HELP**\n\n1. **Rostingu2** - Congratulations!

The knowledge that y'all have and so willingly share with others who truly need assistance is amazing. I love seeing all of you, day after day (some hour after hour! lol), just helping out and making things a little bit easier and a little bit better overall. It's so appreciated! \n\nAnd that takes care of another week. A little bumpy again, but we got seatbelts! And I am buckled up! I'll see everyone right here next week! And I'll be in the comments. I live in the comments! lol  Let's gooooooooooo!",

            "body": "Weekly Recap Comment 3/13/25\n\nThank you for the report.\n\n**Note for the Helpers:**  it is great seeing everyone going up levels every week.  Don\u2019t get discouraged if you\u2019re gaining levels more slowly as you get higher.  The first 5 levels come very quickly.  However when you get there, level 8 to 9 is like climbing Everest.  If you stick with helping you will get there and after that going 9-10 is a breeze.\n\n**Intro:**  I would say that it has been a fairly normal week.  Not bumps too big but not smooth sailing either.  I got a long one for you today.  A Two Parter is back again.  Some issues, some annoyances, one because the proper channels are ignoring me (They don't know that I don't just drop things.  They will learn).  Sorry for the delay, was talking to people, in person.  I know. \n\n**From Your Report;**  I got nothing to add or question.  I do have feelings about the first top post, but I gave it its own issues entry.\n\nEdit:  The new post guidance should help with the third of the top posts.\n\n**In old business.**\u00a0I have seen a couple reports this week about issues going in and out of dark mode again.  Example [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1j9xzmk/dark_mode_not_working_on_desktop_web/)  from yesterday.\n\n**Brought back from last week.**\u00a0  With everything else in my \"short\" comment, this was missed last week.  These upvote notifications seem to be a complete mess right now based on the reports and what I am seeing. Some people have them off and are getting them. Some people have them on and want them but are not getting them. Personally I don\u2019t care if I get them or not, but I do have them on. It seems completely random which ones I get and which I don\u2019t.\n\n**Brought back from last week.**  This second half of this comment on the status of achievement notifications was also missed last week.  I may be the only one seeing this but I doubt it.  I still have never got an insight notification even though I have had multiple posts over 1,000 upvotes including one over 3,000 in the last week and even more with 500+ upvotes. Yet Flag Planter, which I have gotten 66 times, always gives a notification. Additionally, Reddit kindly keeps turning back on the 4 Recommendation notifications when I turn them off, but it doesn\u2019t matter since I don\u2019t get them anyway. And not that I necessarily want it, but I still don\u2019t get new followers notifications. That is nearing on 2 years since I got it.\n\n**Issues**: From the post insights post on r/reddit last week, I noticed that % Upvote Rate is not on their list.  I also don\u2019t have them on the app.  I do have it on the browser.  This is a much requested thing.  I asked on that post about it but there are a ton of comments on that post.  I would like to provide feedback and request if that can be added back in to the app in a future update to it.\n\n**Issue:**  There have been a number of posts here and in bugs starting later yesterday about some desktop users not being able to send DMs in chat.  It does not appear to be an established account issue and an actual bug.  Here are some posts.  [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ja546l/comment/mhitu9w/?context=3). [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ja3j5y/cant_initiate_new_chats_desktop/). [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ja422g/cant_send_dms/). [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ja56u1/cannot_send_any_dms_i_see_a_blue_arrow_next_to_my/).\n\n**Issues**.  When trying to view the people following you on the app, at least the iOS app, you can only see the most recent 25.  None of the pages load after the first.\n\n**Issue**:  We both know my thoughts on how safety operates and how it has zero concerns for the users and what I think about this new upvote punishing.  Here is a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1jaa09s/i_got_a_warning_for_upvoting_something/) today about it and the confusion it causes since they do not tell people what they upvoted in violation of their secret rules.  I am throwing this out there knowing there is nothing you can say or do except possibly say that you will pass the feedback along.  How does upvoting violent content that leads to the warning  \"Break The Site\", Violate Rule 8.  Are they catagorizing it wrong or poorly or are they completely devaluing rule 8? It was probably the most serious rule of them all.  What safety itself is doing could be categorized as a violation of rule 8 as it interferes with the core function of voting on content when no violation of the rules has been made. Or a rule 2 violation for vote manipulation.  What's next?  If users try to organize some form of protest against Reddit again, warn and ban everybody who upvotes those posts.  That is breaking the site.\n\n**Issue:**. With the new chat UI that is being rolled out, a user [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1j3b6gs/reddit_chat_for_ios_changed_yesterday_cant_view/) that they could not view the profile of the person making the chat request from the chat UI itself.  I have the new chat UI myself and verified that they are correct.  I am hoping that this is a bug and not a design decision.  Though the new UI gives a partial view of the profile, it can still be helpful to be able to see the whole thing.  Adding the step of closing chat or opening the mobile browser and remembering the spelling of their username just to look it up seems excessive.  I can try to provide screen shots or a screen recording if needed but will need someome who has not chatted with me to send a request.  Here is a post from this morning I can link on the subject.  [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ja9k2k/unable_to_view_users_profiles_from_chat_requests/).  I did reach out to the developers over this via two proper channels and have been ignored for over a week.  I am hoping you have better luck.\n\n**Issue:**  I have seen quite a few similar posts to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1j99g0e/on_both_chrome_and_android_i_am_able_to_check/).  For some unknown reason some of some peoples posts do not even have an insight button.  I noticed I was missing one on a removed post, but these posts were up and normal.  These are not necessarily new posts either.  I have seen days or older posts missing it while posts they have made before and after that post have them normally.  From the ones I have seen, it is not subreddit related as they will have other posts from the same subreddit with insights. For those posts it is affecting, it affects both the app and desktop.\n\n**Issue**; In the last couple of days I have seen several reports, like this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1j99jx6/android_i_cant_open_my_previous_post_and_in/), from people who can no longer access their own subreddit.  When I try to access it from desktop I have no issues.  They are all on the app but I can't remember if it is just Android or iOS as well\n\n**Issue:**  I saw a post earlier this week on an issue that comes up from time to time.  It is not possible to removed blocked accounts that have been delete via the app.  You get a message that they Can't be unblocked.  I tested it on the iOS app and got the same results.  I could remove them via desktop though.",

We are actively investigating this rn. There are a small % of users in a control group for this feature, but if it's happening frequently it may be a bug. Would be really helpful if you can share any links to posts where you're experiencing this so we can see if there are any patterns.",

I think I could in the past but am not positive.  I went to share a post I made on one of my subreddits, r/Kale10sroundup , via the iOS app and noticed that there was no share button.  I also could not find anyway to share the url of the post through any of the user or mod menues.  With some checking this is the case with all of my subreddits. Share is there as normal on both desktop and the mobile web for the same subreddits.  It is also there for posts I made in other subreddits.  It seems to be a mod thing but it does not affect posts made to profile.  Also, because I cannot turn off mod mode on the app I cannot test it.  I did try to uninstall and reinstall the app and that didn't help.  I did check a different account of mine and they could not share posts from my subreddits they are a mod on.  Even if that account did not make the posts .  It was the same on sfw and nsfw subreddits.\n\n**Question?**  If an account is permanently banned and disabled so they can\u2019t log in to appeal,  should they submit this [form](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232) with account status, my account was wrongly suspended to try to get back in?  Or should they submit the form with password problems, password reset isn\u2019t working to clear the disabled?  I recommended the first one and am checking to make sure it was the right advice.\n\n**Annoyance**:  Those newish [color coded awards](https://imgur.com/a/Si2RzSi) to give from the app are simplistic and juvenile.  While I have to much better [original awards](https://imgur.com/a/Hyee9nG) on desktop and mobile browser?  I know that the answer to the following question is no because there never is for anything, but Is there a place to provide feedback?\n\n**Conclusion**:  I have rambled on enough.  Communication\u2026Character Count\u2026Reddit Safety hates users and is authoritarian\u2026 yada yada yada.\n\nThank you for reading my ramblings.",

It's a very small percentage, though.

Manipulating the voting on certain groups of content they are problematic or just potentially problematic even if it is not.  As well as potentially manipulating voting on a wide variety of content out of fear of repercussions.  See this modsupport [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1j7lwa8/please_advise_us_on_reddits_expectations_for/).\n\n\n\nOf the examples given, which are not all inclusive:\n\n* **Soliciting votes:**\u00a0Requesting or **encouraging people** to upvote or **downvote specific posts**, either on Reddit or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain.\n* **Participating in Group Voting:**\u00a0Joining or forming groups **that coordinate votes**, either on a specific post, a user's posts, content from a domain, etc.\u00a0\n\nThose are not perfect and are a bit of a reach, but vote manipulation is more than the three examples.",
