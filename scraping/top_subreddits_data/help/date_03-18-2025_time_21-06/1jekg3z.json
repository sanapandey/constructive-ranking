I'm writing answers to these points, numbering them in a similar way to keep them organized. But Reddit's crappy Markdown engine intercepted these point numbers, pulled them away from the reign of my cursor and changed 4 to 3. If I correct the issue in plain text mode, it still keeps turning my number 4 to number 3 the moment I click \"Post\" time and time again. Is there a way to fix that?",
