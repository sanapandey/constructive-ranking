By the time I hit submit I got an error. I refreshed the page and all the legit comments showed up as deleted.\n\nSo it's not spam comments getting deleted. For all I know this comment will get deleted.\n\nThe other weird thing is \\[deleted\\] is different from \\[removed\\]. It's not like moderators on some subs are just going crazy.",
