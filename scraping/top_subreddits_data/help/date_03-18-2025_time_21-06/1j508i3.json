If there were people that didn\u2019t like it they didn\u2019t have to have that setting on! They could just leave it as the default long press. I don\u2019t understand why the feature would be removed when it\u2019s a setting that could be toggled. If someone felt it was messing with other gestures they could just toggle it back. That way they can have their preferred method and the others that like swipe to collapse can have theirs. Forcing the choice on thousands of users because some of them had trouble figuring out how to use it is not a good reason. \n\nI keep having several instances where I am trying to collapse a thread. I swipe to the \u201cnext post\u201d because of this feature removal. Then I swipe \u2018back\u2019 to go back except it doesn\u2019t take me to the post I was just at, it takes me to the feed. So then I have to tap into the thread I was in before. Then scroll/collapse through until I remember where I was in the thread. If you want to talk about \u2018messing with other gestures\u2019 I would say that\u2019s a great example right there because most of the time instead of going back to continue engaging with the thread I just lost my place in, I just get frustrated and close the app. \n\nOn another note, I am also having issues like the other user on iOS with long press not collapsing. Happens quite a bit. I\u2019ve noticed it happens a lot if I\u2019m not long pressing on the top comment in a thread. I press on something further down and it doesn\u2019t collapse. So I either have to scroll up to the top comment and do it there, or I will naturally try to swipe it closed because that\u2019s the natural intuitive motion and end up on a different post with no way to go back, or I just get frustrated and close the app.",

I posted about it on r/bugs as well, thinking this was an unintentional change; the app is so incredibly clunky and difficult to navigate without it, that it became too frustrating to keep opening. It was by far my most used app and I have since switched over to Bluesky on mobile, and only view Reddit when I am at home on my desktop now.\n\nThat single gesture was what had me sold on Alien Blue when I was originally finding a mobile client, and one that kept me stuck to the official app over any alternatives until now. Removing it in favor of viewing a random Reddit post is the absolute worst change imaginable; not once have I wanted to view a random post's comment section by swiping. Swiping to a random post has caused me to completely stop using most other social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, and avoid things like TikTok and Reels altogether.\n\nIf there is an update in the near future to re-implement this *core* feature, I'll be back, but for the time being I'll just use an platform that actually *wants* its user to browse through the app reliably.",
