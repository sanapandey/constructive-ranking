    "selftext": "Hi, i had posted a couple days back iver my original account (might not mention since last time i included a username the post got deleted) getting hacked and now the hacker has kicked me out. He has changed both the password and the email address, but i can still see my posts, my comments. But now hes just acting like a devout muslim in my account. How can i either recover it or have it get deleted. Id rather not have an account than have it used like that. Will mention the account that was hacked if allowed. ",

I've appealed the ban multiple times but haven't head back after the original appeal.  The first appeal was denied.  Crazy considering I've had that account for 12 years.  Its disappointing the mods could not see the obvious when looking at my account.  Profile and links were all changed to someone else's information.  Have submitted multiple emails to support - hopefully someone can look into this.",

For some reason, Reddit flagged my account as suspicious and then locked it and forced a password reset.  Now I can't post from it, can't send chat messages, can't send direct messages, it's completely locked down.  It's very frustrating :(",

It\u2019s so unfortunate time and time again people come here to get answers and are told they just have to deal with the hackers\u2026 it\u2019s uncool and you\u2019re gonna be seeing A LOT of gamers disappear pretty soon if they dont try to hold these people accountable for their actions. No reason we should have to go without because you ruined your chances/ don\u2019t have the means to get it for yourself. Most of us worked hard and earned these advantages whether that\u2019s by working or, by doing your chores n listening to your parents.",
