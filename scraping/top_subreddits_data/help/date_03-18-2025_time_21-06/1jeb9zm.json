(in my case it\u2019s from my siblings and i both using reddit, sometimes the same subs) My question is should i be worried? I\u2019ve had this account for 2 years & this is the first warning ive ever had. Will they give me more warnings, or will they just ban my account?\n",

I've had the account for 12 years and not had so much as a warning for anything against reddit rules.  Have appealed and it was denied, have re-appealed and submitted support tickets.  I don't use any other social media, this site is my go to so it is extremely crushing to have an account banned like that.",

In the past, I've had 2 3-day suspensions for simply reporting posts on a sub that indeed did violate the rules of the sub. After the second time, I simply stopped reporting things in subs where the mods themselves either encouraged reports on rule violations or where the mods are so blatantly distant they can't even be bothered with actually moderating.  \nAfter the last wave of warnings and bans for simply upvoting posts, I even stopped upvoting anything that holds an opinion other than comments and posts on gaming subs where it by no means can be seen as anything else but gaming related.  \n\nI'm not saying you should be paranoid, I just don't trust Reddit admins the same way I used to.  \n\nI recommend messaging the admins over modmail and explaining your situation to them, although it can take anywhere from weeks to months before you get a reply from them since they are quite busy (hence their reliance on bots for doing most of their work in regards to warnings and bans).",

A human will then probably message you to fill in a ticket while providing a link.\n\nBut you're welcome! I hope they will do something about your case and that you'll have a positive outcome :)",
