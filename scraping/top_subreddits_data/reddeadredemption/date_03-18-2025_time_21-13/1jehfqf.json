This polite old white lady in antebellum attire starts giving us, about 75 Black teens and our Black chaperones who were college professors, a tour of the plantation.  \n\nEverything seems to be going fine as she tells us about the features of the home and how it worked until we got to the master suite where there was this basin of sorts near the bed. She explained how this is where the slaves would bathe their master. She then said to this group of nothing but Black people, \"Imagine how awkward this must have been for the master!\" and one of the professors just shouted, \"IMAGINE HOW AWKWARD IT WAS FOR THE SLAVES!\" \n\nShe was flabbergasted. You could tell she literally never considered it from their perspective. Rest of the tour she was just real time checking herself to make sure she didn't say something insane again.",

After seeing it in real life, reading the history, and having it explained through the tour, it really grounds you. I am extremely grateful for Josephine Stewart whose family owned the plantation after the original plantation owners were bankrupted. She started the Oak Alley foundation which maintains the structure, history, and tours at the plantation since the 70s.",
