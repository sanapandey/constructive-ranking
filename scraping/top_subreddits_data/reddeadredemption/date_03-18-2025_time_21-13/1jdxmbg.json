There is no roaming around, looking at stuff, listening to birds or watch the rivers flow. There is no greeting NPCs. It's just one mission to another.\n\nI don't think I'll ever experience gaming the same way. RDR2 has ruined all other games for me :(",

It's not *exactly* like RDR2, but it's not trying to be. \n\nWhat struck me most when I got back into it was how *gorgeous* of a game it was. RDR2 looks real, as real as can be. GoT isn't going for that; it's more like a cinematographic take of Japan from that period. The cinematography is brilliant, parts of Tsushima are designed specifically to look like something from an anime.",

There\u2019s lots of cool things to see and observe, but they only exist to be seen by you. \n\nCompare that to RDR2, where you have a living breathing world of NPCs and wildlife that do their own thing regardless of whether you\u2019re observing them.\n\nRDR2 feels like a simple simulation of a world that you\u2019re playing in. GOT just feels like a game or a theme park.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean every game world needs to feel alive and lean on sim elements. You can just as easily enjoy games that are not trying to be deeper than theme worlds. \n\nBut I\u2019m just pointing out that what the OP is missing isn\u2019t something they can find in GOT.",

You can technically listen to birds and watch the river flow, but it just feels like a show someone has put on in front of you. It feels like a theme park exhibit, not a living breathing world. Because GOT isn\u2019t trying to sim that stuff. \n\nAnd there\u2019s obviously no NPC reactivity like RDR2. Because the NPCs are little more than set dressings. Not that there are autonomous AI agents in RDR2 or anything like that. But the developers went out of their way to give NPCs basic routines, situate them in specific towns, and give them basic AI to respond to our actions and dialogs. It\u2019s not all that complex, but the mere fact is that they\u2019re trying to simulate the NPCs to some extent, as opposed to just being set dressings. And it goes a long way towards making the world alive and breathing.",

It's a 40 million USD game developed by a relatively new studio of which a lot of developers didn't have any game dev experience. KCD2 is fantastic, my 2nd favourite game of all time, but rdr2 just has \"more\" simply because of its larger production size.\n\nThat said, I definitely recommend the game.",

CDPR put in a ton of dev work post-release to clean those up.\n\nIt now runs excellently. I played it on PC so I won't comment on console performance but I'm certain it's fine on current gen consoles.\n\nIt's just a fantastic game with an absolute acid trip of a story line lol. Think it's my favorite game of all time now.  Night City is a great open world with tons of character and energy, there are a bunch of different build types you can do that are super fun and unique, and the writing is superb as with anything CDPR. The DLC is probably the best DLC I've ever played for any game.",

Let me break this down like you're 5.\n\nIf you spend 5 dollars on art supplies to make a project and then $50 on another, there will be a quality discrepancy between the two final products. How much it is sold for doesnt affect that, even if it's sold for the same price. That's just how it works.\n\nYour thought process is just busted. It's like saying the budget of Captain America Civil War being 2x larger than Ant Man and the Wasp shouldn't have mattered to the mutual quality of the final products because the ticket price you paid is the same. When obviously Civil War is better in a variety of ways, literally just because they had more money to throw around.",

Do you think rdr2 should just be discredited because it has such a high budget? Do you think low budget games cannot be as good and we should lower our expectations?

                    "body": "Jesus Christ you spurg, the statement being made was that or course objective quality goes up as budget rises in 90% of cases. More money usually equates to the ability to have a higher fidelity product. The only other objective measures that contribute to the quality of a final product now are time and passion. Nobody gives af about the general publics reaction, that wasn't even a part of the discussion. You're hyper fixating on the minutia of a blanket statement, which makes no sense even considering the context. Nobody was talking about whether or not one was more successful than the other. The only thing being discussed was the quality of the final product.\nAlso you didnt even *actually* understand the art project analogy, which is quite literally sad. The whole point is budget ALWAYS affects the quality of the final product, so them being sold for the same price is actually the irrelevant detail. Its the quality of the work that is the relevant one, and quality is again ALWAYS affected by budget. That doesn't mean lower budget equals a bad product, it just increases the chances of it being of lower quality. Which fun fact something can be of lower quality in certain areas due to budget and still be successful or an overall good product. That's where passion and/or time usually pick up the slack from a lack of budget. \n\nQuality is determined most largely by budget in the modern era. Higher quality typically means success. Ergo the commonality in our culture is the higher the budget of a project, there is a higher quality to the final product, and then generally it is successful because of said quality, which said quality is usually a direct result of budget. But it all goes back to budget first generally speaking. Passion and time come second and third. You seem to not understand this at all. Its like you think budget doesn't affect quality and quality doesn't affect opinion, and then you turn around and contradict yourself by calling the higher budget product higher quality and more well received.\n\nBut please, continue to be a sudo intellectual while lacking any form of reading comprehension or understanding of subtext.",

I agree with you that budget in theory should result in a better product, but why is it fair to excuse shortcomings of the product when it is sold at the same price? That was my whole point. I understand that budget plays a part in the result but when it is sold at the same price, then why does it suddenly become relevant and we excuse limitations? Rdr2 and ghost of tsushima were priced the same, so why is it okay to say \"well it's not fair to compare them because of their budget.\" That's ridiculous and budget is irrelevant because when you pay the same for a product it's fair to expect the same quality is it not? Or else you face lower sales which is what happened as rdr2 outsold them by a huge amount.",

The magic is while you fuck around you ARE grinding, collecting herbs and pelts and running through the water on horseback to kill fish. You cook and make tonics and that helps you on missions. If you take the time to enjoy your time the game rewards you. You messing around uncovers secrets to the games mechanics and it feels like I accomplish so much and all I've done in run in a circle and intimidated people before wasting money on poker. \n\nI love management games, I love farming stuff, rouge likes, whatever elden ring is, but gosh I do go back to rdr2 way too much.

Yes it does have a bit of gross humor here and there, but I mean it in a sense that it's so sure of what it's doing that it sacrifices accessibility in the process.\n\nI put in around 65 hours into the game and loved every moment of it, but for some reason I couldn't bother playing after finishing Johns story missions and had a hard time playing for long stretches of time. It just got me feeling tired, like I was putting work into it.\n\nThere are games with gameplay loops that are more fun, or with a single mechanic that will make you come back I believe that if you play a game trying to recreate the feeling of another game you're gonna have a bad time.",

A bar was set that 90 percent of games can\u2019t meet. There\u2019s a few games I deemed great that I went back revisit post completing RDR2. They come up short of this new standard. \n\nWhen it comes to immersive feel of an open world RDR2 feels alive. It\u2019s a feeling game developers don\u2019t have the budget to match flat out. The closest they can get is making one that looks as stunning which is not the same. \n\nThe game play feels good. I have close to no complaints on this one. There\u2019s plenty of games that equally as fun to play. I feel like developers have to either try to fail or try something new that doesn\u2019t land for game play to be poor. There isn\u2019t nothing new under the sun and there\u2019s already an existing template. \n\nThe character development and story told was top notch. Hollywood isn\u2019t even capable of writing compelling stories and characters like these in the mainstream lately. This in my opinion is where most games have trouble shining but there\u2019s stories out there with great writing.  \n\nAll and all my conclusion was I needed to stop measuring games up to that standard that\u2019s literally lightning in a bottle. The best I can hope for is to check one of those three boxes. I either get top notch game play, an immersive open world or high quality story telling. If just one of those categories is stellar I\u2019m fine with the others being just ok or decent. That\u2019s how I got my feet back on ground with my expectations.",

It actually really sucks, because I feel like I miss out on a lot of good games because of it. RDR2 was the first game I played straight through with no issues and loved every second of it. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for RPGs, I\u2019ve found luck with Dragon Age, Veilgaurd. it\u2019s on play station plus rn. I wish I had played Inquisition first for a better understanding of the story), but I finished it rather quickly. ESO is also a fun one, but I got overwhelmed and I felt like I wasn\u2019t able to really nail down what I was supposed to be doing because there\u2019s SO much and quests kept adding up and it was getting hard to keep track of. I also have no friends that game, because apparently a lot of women are allergic to relaxing, and ESO is undoubtedly more fun (I can imagine) with a friend to play with. I am planning on started Avowed, as I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s really good, and that\u2019s on game pass for Xbox. \n\nI got spoiled with RDR2 and The Ghost of Tsushima seemed way less \u201csmooth\u201d in the movement and fighting style, so it turned me off pretty quick. I also don\u2019t like games where I feel like I\u2019m being drug through it or from quest to quest like a chore task list, so I\u2019m glad you said something because I\u2019m not going to try it again. I prefer more adventuring and going at my own pace, which Dragon Age and ESO do allow for. \n\nThe Witcher 3 is also on play station plus right now, and I did hear it\u2019s one of the best RPGs ever made. I started it. But I got *distracted* (big surprise), so I have nothing to say about it yet lol. But I will be trying that one again.",

It draws you into the world. \n\nOther games have decent stories and worlds, absolutely, but RDR2 somehow managed to suck you into the world as Arthur Morgan or later as John Marston. \n\nTo me, that is what made RDR2 special. That is what made RDR2 more than just a simple game, but rather an emersive experience. And I don't know if there has been another game that has been able to replicate that same level as of yet.",

Some games are just to obviously games, not enough immersion, npcs have no life, random occurrences are non existent or repetitive.

It\u2019s fine, it serves a purpose but it takes me out of the story. There are forsure great games out there but, I\u2019ve changed as a player, and I\u2019m less committed to chipping away. Red Dead just feels real in ways other games don\u2019t, every drawer has items that would be there. Each body remains after a fight and you can loot items they would reasonably have. Cyberpunk, Skyrim, Fallout, all feel lived in. It\u2019s insanely hard to achieve, I enjoy other games for what they are but I\u2019m always drawn back to the worlds I get lost in.",
