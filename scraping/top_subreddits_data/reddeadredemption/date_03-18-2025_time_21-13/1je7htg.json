One second he's there, next second he's gone, and there's no time for grieving. The whole botched bank robbery is a great reality check for the gang and the player.\n\n\nThe only thing I can agree with is the weapon wheel auto equipping different guns during certain moments in missions, that's pretty annoying and pointless.",

I don't know, they seem like senseless complaints to me? you are obviously free to have your opinion, you don't have to like everything about the game because it has flaws like any other videogame.\n\nI find the complaints about Lenny in particular quite inconsistent, because his character was not that of a \"badass\" person, but of a young boy who had gotten involved in something bigger than himself and about which he still had a lot to learn. you can also see from the dialogues that he is not yet in the true \"outlaw\" mood, but that he was having fun learning this new lifestyle, and was grateful to Dutch and the others for giving him a chance. basically Lenny was just a naive boy and wanted to be included in something; this is not my way of belittling his character, on the contrary, but this is how I perceived him throughout the story.\n\nEagle Flies' death makes sense in terms of writing and screenplay, because it gave that extra dramatic sense that the story of the natives needed, also giving more depth to everything that happened. the natives story should have given you that sense of drama and his death was the perfect touch, but that doesn't mean it was useless and that this makes his character wasted. his death is only a consequence of his actions, and the one who will suffer for it will be his father, who will also feel partly responsible. his death is just the beginning of a folk disappearing.  \nevery death in this video game makes sense and tells you something, nothing is left to chance.\n\nI don't think making Arthur more ruthless would have made his redemption more impactful. the various anecdotes that are told give us a good understanding of what kind of person Arthur was, we know he's done a lot of bad things, but making him too much ruthless wouldn't have helped his writing because it would have made his redemption less realistic. the point of his character is that he does bad things, he was taught to survive like that, but he has ideals that make him a good man, and this person finally showed up in the end, when he finally understood that the life he was living wasn't right. if he had been the way you wanted all this wouldn't have been possible, at that point then it would have been better to have Micah as the protagonist instead of Arthur.\n\nthese are the least sensible complaints in my opinion and that I wanted to focus on. I want to repeat that you are free to think as you want and that there is no right or wrong, we just think differently. but your opinion on Arthur honestly remains very debatable in terms of characterization of the character and would have made everything more needlessly complicated. I honestly think that Arthur is perfect as he is and that he has had the best writing of any other character in the world of videogames in the last 10 years.",

                    "body": "It is odd how the most dishonorable actions Arthur does is steal from the debtors. They are some of the few missions where you don't have a choice but to hurt and rob, particularly of people who are worse off than Arthur is. I think his aggression makes sense earlier because the gang actually is strapped for cash but later on you'll have thousands and beat someone up for $20. I think if the morally correct actions were more morally neutral and the dishonorable actions were more severe then the outlaw lifestyle would be clearer.\n\nThe weapon wheel sucks. It's annoying how if you want to have the weapons you want you have to equip them at a gunsmith or safe house every play session and you can't swap what you equipped. They solved the issue with online but it was really infuriating during the campaign. Same goes with the mandatory weapons - just let us use what we have or at least let us swap our loadouts before the fighting actually starts.\n\nYeah I kinda just stopped doing bounties after the first few because all they were really worth was the dialogue between Arthur and the bounty - which were great - but the rewards were basically worthless and riding to the bounty and back was always kinda boring. Online did it differently and although I miss the dialogue of the bounties I do appreciate how different each one is, the different rewards based on the difficulty of the bounty, and that it pays more overall.\n\nForced walking is annoying. I also found it annoying that you couldn't ride your horse in camp - not because I wanted to but I would ride toward camp, go a bit too far, and get this forced animation of Arthur turning around and the gang chastising him when I wasn't even trying to do that. However, I also do like how the camp allows you to slow down and breathe instead of running around and galloping everywhere.\n\nCustomisation in general is kinda lame. I thought online was lacking but there only being a couple outfits and other clothing options is pretty boring. I get no ponchos for Arthur since he never goes to New Austin, but you also only get a poncho in RDR1 for going to Mexico so there isn't that much of a reason for John to get a poncho either. I am all for more customisation options though and I doubt it would break the immersion that badly.\n\nThe honor system is whatever. Pick the good choices and gain good honor, pick bad and get bad. Kill people who aren't killing you and aren't law and get bad honor. Commit a crime and you'll get bad honor. Help people or avoid doing crime and you get good honor. It is annoying how there isn't a retribution system, like tying someone up but letting them go not changing  the morality of that action, or stealing someone's horse then bringing it back to them still being an evil act. Also running into people being bad is annoying especially in the markets of Saint Denis. They probably could have gone further with the systems and changed more depending on it like RDR1 did, but I guess since Arthur is an outlaw while John was just a dude (he wasn't but the people in the first game see him as just a dude) that discounts and less law attention wouldn't make sense.\n\nI enjoy looking and discussing flaws of games I like, or games that most people consider flawless. It's good to actually see what problems there are because it allows you to appreciate what they do get right even more. No piece of media is ever perfect - it is just whether you are willing to overlook the issues because the positives outweigh it. I love the game but there were a lot of annoying features such as the weapon wheel and (not mentioned) animal spawn rates and grinding in general being boring and unfun, and I think it's good to bring them up.",
