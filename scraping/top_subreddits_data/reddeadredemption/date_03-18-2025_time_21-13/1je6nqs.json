Kevin ball revolvers were actually used all the way up into the twenties by a lot of folks who lived in more rural and frontier areas. Sure they weren't popular and they weren't the best but people still had them as they were family heirlooms or Just that's what was available. \n\nI mean there are plenty of people who still carry revolvers for self-defense today despite semi-automatics basically outclassing most revolvers in every single way. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why people didn't use extra cylinders for cap and ball revolvers. We see on the Clint Eastwood movie pale Rider that he carries an 1870 Remington that has a cap and ball style cylinder but he is switched out for one that does cartridges but he actually swaps the cylinder and what I don't get is why people weren't doing that back in the day other than gun manufacturers probably weren't making extra cylinders",
