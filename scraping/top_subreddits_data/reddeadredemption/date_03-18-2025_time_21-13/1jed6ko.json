    "selftext": "Cool easter egg aside, based on how much Jack understood about his father's life and to a greater extent the Van Der Linde gang how accurate a book would this have been? I didn't pen Jack as someone to lie about the nature of his father's actions but then realized that he was a literal child when most of the fallout happened so how much could he actually write about?\n\nThere's also the fact that, contextually, RDR2 came out many years after GTAV so this easter egg could only really be talking about his father and maaaybe himself?",

            "body": "The book doesn't actually need to be historical. It could simply be a fictional western novel that is slightly based on what Jack remembers and heard about the era. Jack could have also interviewed former gang members for stories, and Jack had years of listening to Uncle's stories. So there's a lot to inspire a fictional book. \n\nAnd RDR came out in 2010 and GTA5 came out in 2013. So Jack's info, and by definition the prequel RDR2, predates anything in GTA. But again, it's just a book. And it's never been stated that GTA and RDR are in the same universe. So sometimes an Easter Egg is just an Easter Egg.",

I believe our best shot at discovering if they're in the same universe is wait for GTA 6, since the map should include all of Florida and, if I recall correctly, Saint Denis and Lemoyne are inspired from New Orleans, which I think is in Florida (I'm not American). I think it'd be cool to see Saint Denis in GTA 6 but it's unlikely that will happen. Still, if it's not there but another New Orleans representation is there, then we will understand anyway. Dunno, just speculation of mine",

I'm taking the tact of writing it like Jack has put it together both from his own memories, from what he remembers of Uncle's stories and from Arthur and John's diaries. There's nothing pre-Blackwater because that's the earliest diary entry he has and because it was really the point where the redemption of both men began, and he's writing it as his own attempt at redemption for his actions in RDR1.",
