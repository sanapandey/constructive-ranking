    "selftext": "Wall of text incoming - TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI\u2019ve heard many people say things about sieges which I wasn\u2019t sure were correct - I\u2019ve played quite a lot of sieges and actually quite enjoy them (I used to really not like them), and whilst they definitely have problems I think there is also a lot of misinformation out there, and because many people simply don\u2019t enjoy them (or potentially misunderstand them, as I used to), I think that there\u2019s a certain element of the \u2018skill issue\u2019 meme going on.\n\nI did a few quick tests to look into some of these. All testing is empire vs empire in custom battles, ultra unit size, normal battle difficulty, map is Altdorf, I\u2019m defending the AI is attacking. All numbers are approximations averaged across several units however they\u2019re broadly correct.\n\n**(1) Walls -**\n\n*\"Walls are useless, you may as well defend chokepoints\" -* Tested two units. - Xbow vs Swordsman\n\n**Land battle - Xbow vs Sword -** Directly charging at me in a Land Battle on flat terrain the Xbow gets off 3-4 volleys before the swordsman arrives, leaving a full health swordsman with approximately 103 models left and approximately 5200hp of its total 8280 remaining (approx 1/3 damage taken).\n\n**Siege - Xbow vs Sword -** Directly charging at my Xbow stationed on the wall the Xbow gets off around 6-7 volleys before the swordsmen climb half way up the ladder, leaving approximately 70 models left and 3500hp (approx 1/2 damage taken).\n\n* Important point - Once the enemy swordsmen were half way up their ladders I was able to retreat my Xbows to a new position deeper within the city (again on elevated terrain, either because of the map or on one of the firing platforms), giving my Xbow the chance to shoot its full volley again and from an elevated position. I can easily continue this tactic on any siege map until the Xbow runs out of ammo, meaning this 450 gold unit can perform easily for 1000+ gold.\n* Important point 2 - If you have an xbow on the wall and a swordsman directly behind it (also on the wall), you can kill much of the attacking unit with the crossbow, swap the crossbow and the swordsman (crossbow retreats into the city), and the swordsman can easily finish off the remaining attacking swordsmen (defender took around 1/10th casualties/hp damage) before retreating itself.\n\n**Land battle - Sword vs Sword** \\- 50/50 obviously as they're the same unit.\n\n**Siege - Sword vs Sword -** Directly charging at me on a wall - in the default formation when you click a unit onto the wall (4 men deep), leaving your men alone - the defenders won the fight, with approximately 4000hp remaining, and around 60-65 models.\n\n* Important point - The major casualties for the defending unit started when the attackers cut all the way through the centre of the unit and started hitting the defending units in the soldiers\u2019 side. Prior to this they took very few casualties.\n* Important point 2 - Unfortunately you cannot drag units into a deeper formation, meaning they\u2019re always going to get cut through if you just leave them there with no orders. Giving an attack order when the enemy are on the wall makes it take a far longer time for the attacker to break through the centre of the defender\u2019s formation, and your soldiers more readily face the attackers, meaning they perform far better. As can be seen here around 2/3 of my soldiers survived an attack (when giving an attack order it is approximately 4500hp remaining and 78 models, meaning to defeat an equivalent unit you only lose 1/3 of your own unit).\n* Important point 3 - Trying to retreat your unit whilst there is an enemy coming up the ladders results in huge casualties. It's better to only fight when you're sure that the enemy will be routed, and retreat once they are routed.\n\n**(2) Towers -**\n\n*\"Towers suck\" -* they're not world winners but they're not too bad. A tier 1 tower will take approx 1/5th the health from a swordsman before it reaches the wall. A tier 2 tower approx 1/4th the health. Tier 3 approx 1/2 the health. Tier 4 I cba testing but it's quite a lot.\n\n* Important point - This is completely free damage, if I have tier 3 towers and you're attacking, and 2 of those towers are shooting, it's easily possible for me to kill 3-4 units (if we consider that most units rout at around 20% health remaining) *without having lost a single soldier myself*.\n* Important point 2 - A lot of the damage for these towers is AP, meaning that they can kill expensive armoured units. This can be very valuable.\n* Important point 3 - The wall towers do approximately the same damage as their supply-using build-able counterparts. This means that if you park a cheap spear unit under a built tier 3 tower, and the spear lasts let's say two times as long as it would have taken the enemy to reach the wall, a tier 3 tower can kill the equivalent of a unit of chosen (1250g) for the cost of 1400 supplies and a sacrificial lamb.\n\n**(3) Emplacements suck -**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\"\\*\\*\\**What's the point in barricades?\" -* They basically have the same force-multiplying effect as walls. Your own units can pass through them with no problems at all. This can buy you time for your ranged units to be shooting, doing lots and lots of damage. If an enemy is in melee with a barricade with ranged units stood on top of it, the ranged units will not fire. Place one of your own units in front of the barricade, and your ranged units will fire. When you feel it's the right time, retreat.\n\n**(4) Overall summary of my rambling**\n\n* Point 1 - Siege defences act as a force-multiplier. Depending on how well you play, how good the defences are, etc, you can expect a 2x to 3x force mutliplier. Don't expect your garrison with a gold value of 3000 to defeat a 19 stack of Chosen lead by Archaon. Do however expect it to be able to reasonably beat an army twice to three times its own strength/cost (if played correctly).\n* Point 2 - Elevation bonuses. CA released a blog a few years ago about how good elevation bonuses are. This can be seen when fighting from walls, or the tops of barricades, or even simply fighting on hills. Your units do a lot, lot more damage. Most siege maps are littered with places to fight with the hill advantage.\n* Point 3 - Fatigue. Whilst the enemy is attacking, your units get to stand still for quite a lot of the time. The enemy don't. Your units are generally fighting at a better level of fatigue, especially if you use the barricades to fight and retreat, then rest.\n* Point 4 - Always fight and retreat. If you defend your walls and retreat at the correct time (and the battle isn't horribly imbalanced), you can kill approximately the value of your own entire army before the enemy has even taken the walls. This is before you've even used your supplies. The important point here is retreating at the correct time. If you mess up your timing, you can take enormous casualties.\n* Point 5 - Each minor supply location should be defended by at least 5-6 units. If you don't have that many, it's better to just let them have it. If you have to sacrifice 2 units so that 3 can retreat to the next location, so be it\n* Point 6 - Sieges are confusing. There's so much going on that they can be really confusing and overwhelming. I suspect this is one of the reasons most people don't like them. Come up with a fight-and-retreat plan before pressing start battle.\n* Point 7 - **Added as edit** \\- *Enemies climbing over the walls everywhere*. This is true, and to clarify I would consider walls to only be the first line of defence. You should be losing fewer than 10% of your soldiers on the wall before retreating to the more defensive chokepoints. The point of the walls in the game is that it allows you to kill a significant amount of the enemy army whilst taking no damage yourself. Your main points of defence are the minor supply locations. As I said I have 5-6 units defend every minor supply location, and If I don't have enough I just pick the most defensible ones. I'm in no way suggesting it's a good idea to fight to the death on the walls; I'd only say shoot missiles from the wall and retreat in good time, and only fight in melee on the walls when it's going to be a quick rout before you retreat your melee units :). If they're attacking in 6 positions on the wall and you can get value from 3, get value from those 3 and retreat to the minor supply locations without getting bogged down.\n* Point 8 - **Edit 2 -** *The purpose of walls is free value, not to stand and hold*. As many people have pointed out, the enemy usually has more units than you, and will ass-ladder all over the place, meaning if your melee units fight it out on the walls they'll get surrounded and overwhelmed, even if they are winning. To clarify I don't think you should make your main stand at the walls, you will get surrounded and killed. I think you should shoot from them until the enemy is close, then retreat to the more defensible minor supply locations. The only reason I would have a melee unit fight on the walls is if it will rout a heavily damaged enemy unit quickly enough for my unit to retreat to the minor supply location.\n\nI hope that all of this perhaps makes sieges a bit more fun for a few people. Enjoy.\n\nTL;DR - Sieges may not be as bad as you thought if you give them another try, and make use of a few of the possible tips and tricks, some of which are shown here.",

            "body": "I don't think most people who say, for example, \"Walls are useless\" literally think that there is no use to the walls. If defending units weren't at a significant advantage fighting on the walls that'd be ridiculous. \n\nWhat they mean is that since enemy units can climb up anywhere on the walls and the AI will never attack in a siege without substantially outnumbering the defender, there's no point in trying to defend them 90% of the time because the AI will just climb up everywhere and any units on the walls will either be surrounded or stuck in a fight on the walls whilst the enemy caps objectives. Might as well just defend the objectives directly. \n\nWhereas if you take older Total War games without magically spawning ladders, each enemy ladder or siege tower becomes its own choke point where you can actually bring the advantage of being the defender to bear. \n\nOther Total War games that do let units climb walls also do it better. \n\nThree Kingdoms allows units to scale walls but because fatigue is more impactful and arrow towers are dangerous and numerous. The player is discouraged from just rushing the walls. It can work in Three Kingdoms but is dangerous and you have many better tools at your disposal (fire arrows, siege towers, turtle formation, the almighty trebuchet). Even against a relatively weak garrison, if you just throw your units at the walls in Three Kingdoms you are gonna take heavy casualties. \n\nWarhammer 3 encourages just rushing the walls because it's way less risky than other games and if you don't rush in fast the enemy will build towers and barricades and make life even more miserable once you're in the city.",

And the regular siege maps suffer from exactly the problem you say. \n\nThe AI will not attack them unless it has a significant autoresolve advantage. This means it usually has a large numerical advantage. It will split up its forces to attack multiple wall segments, and you simply cannot commit enough forces to each to stop or even meaningfully delay them. If your try to hold as many  attacked walls as you reasonably can, some portions of the attackers will make it into city unchallenged, and will be able to win through capturing point faster than the fight for the walls is over.\n\nYour other option is to try to funnel the enemy in the paths inside the city, in a way that prevents the enemy from winning by capture, and hold them in chokepoints, preferably under buildable towers.\n\nThe former is somewhat viable against the very slowest of enemies, but usually the latter is the more successful option.",

Nobody is gonna waste time and resources building a useless fortification, so if the Empire/Dawi/Elves/etc. build a fortress, they'll build one that can stand up to these threats. \n\nAs for in-game solutions, the most obvious fix would be to remove units' spontaneously generated pocket ladders. In older titles, armies had to spend a turn or two building ladders like we currently do with siege towers. With a limited number of ladders, attackers couldn't as easily swarm the walls to overwhelm the defenders; they had to wear the defenders down with successive (costly) waves.  \n\nAnother fix would be to implement designated staircases/ramps for the walls, like we had in older titles. These structures acted as secondary choke points for defenders to keep enemies from pouring into the city. Each wall had several ramps, so attackers could still outflank the defenders with sufficient numbers. But attackers couldn't just swarm into the settlement across its entire front all at once like they currently do. \n\nA third fix would be to implement better choke points in city streets. Obviously not every city is built with siege defense in mind, but castles and forts should have sensible defensive layouts with multiple kill zones. Towers shouldn't be positioned behind architecture that blocks their view of the capture zone, and defensive platforms shouldn't face nonsensical directions. Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 did this well with multi-walled and multi-tiered castles, respectively. Even Empire did a decent job with its star forts and garrisoned defensive buildings.",

If you didn't need to worry about the enemy infantry swarming your walls en masse, you could park a few anti-large units on the wall to defend your archers from flying monsters. And while the dragon is occupied by your spearmen, your archers can resume their harassment of the units below. \n\nThese proposals would help against artillery for the same reasons. \n\nTo start, let's look at how we currently deal with enemy artillery as a faction without summons or map-wide army abilities. At present, the only answer to attacking artillery is to man the walls so that your towers can shoot back. But since the enemy can swarm the walls, you'll often lose control of the towers very quickly. If the towers were more strategically spaced and/or harder for attackers to capture, then you would have an easier time fighting back.\n\nBut also, and perhaps more importantly, if your archers have more time from the wall before being overrun, then their losses to artillery would be more acceptable. In general, artillery is more devastating to undamaged units (more standing models means a bigger target), meaning the first few shots are the ones that hurt the most. Taking that damage to get off 2-3 volleys before abandoning the wall is rarely worthwhile. But taking that damage (plus a little more from follow-up shots) to launch a dozen volleys at the enemy below is a more enticing prospect. \n\nAnd if you have a multi-walled setup, like Empire or Medieval 2, then the primary walls can block some of the shots aimed at units on the secondary walls.",

As I said forts currently allow you to fight with a 2-3 force multiplier, which I think is quite a fair number. I think that perhaps if you're in a position where your opponent is so much stronger than you that they can climb anywhere without you being able to address them at all (even with retreating to the minor supply locations after getting value from the walls), perhaps you should lose.\n\n**Ass ladders -** If it's simply that the opponent has more units than you (as is usually the case), I'd say get as much value out of the wall as you can and retreat to chokepoints/minor supply locations before you take any damage. I think the idea is that you shouldn't be actively fighting at the walls unless you can get a very quick victory, you should be fighting mainly at the minor supply locations (chokepoints). You can't cover every area of the wall, and naturally your opponent is going to pick certain areas you can't cover. You just use the walls where appropriate to get free value *where you can* without actually committing to a fight. If you're outnumbered, pick a couple of locations to fight and retreat.\n\n**Towers -** An additional point I'd raise is that if your opponent is spreading out all over the map, this gives you the opportunity to garrison more towers (and then retreat once the opponent is close, before you take any damage). More towers means more free damage. If I have two tier two towers shooting that nets me perhaps 1-2 unit's worth of damage. If the enemy's so spread out that I have 5 towers shooting? Perhaps 3-5 units worth of damage?\n\nRegarding the AI not attacking unless they're at an overwhelming advantage, I'm not sure if this is true. I've frequently had the AI attack when their force is approx. 1.5x as strong as my force (including my garrison). At 1.5x my strength plus my walls the attacker can be quite easily defeated.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any thoughts on this :)",

I personally prefer this approach as it encourages the player to actively play on the campaign map rather than just building castles everywhere and only using armies to attack and not defend. \n\nCurrently an empire tier 2 city garrison building costs 1600 and provides tier 2 towers/gates as well as 4 units. The units it provides have a total cost of just over 2000 and crucially cost absolutely no upkeep (without the garrison those units would be around 650 upkeep), making it one of the most cost-efficient buildings in the game :)",

This is true, and to clarify I would consider walls to only be the first line of defence.

The point of the walls in the game is that it allows you to kill a significant amount of the enemy army whilst taking no damage yourself. Your main points of defence are the minor supply locations. As I said I have 5-6 units defend every minor supply location, and If I don't have enough I just pick the most defensible ones. I'm in no way suggesting it's a good idea to fight to the death on the walls; I'd only say shoot missiles from the wall and retreat in good time, and only fight in melee on the walls when it's going to be a quick rout before you retreat your melee units :). If they're attacking in 6 positions on the wall and you can get value from 3, get value from those 3 and retreat to the minor supply locations without getting bogged down.\n\n\n\nPoint 8 - **Edit 2 -** *The purpose of walls is free value, not to stand and hold*. As many people have pointed out, the enemy usually has more units than you, and will ass-ladder all over the place, meaning if your melee units fight it out on the walls they'll get surrounded and overwhelmed, even if they are winning. To clarify I don't think you should make your main stand at the walls, you will get surrounded and killed. I think you should shoot from them until the enemy is close, then retreat to the more defensible minor supply locations. The only reason I would have a melee unit fight on the walls is if it will rout a heavily damaged enemy unit quickly enough for my unit to retreat to the minor supply location.",

            "body": "I feel like your post is, probably not on purpose, a massive strawman. You misunderstand many issues with sieges and many of them arn't adressed at all.\n\nThe core issue with sieges is simple: They are not fun.\n\nThis core issue then has multiple has 3 manifestations: The optimal strategy is not engaging with the siege mechanic, the AI sucks, and there are many bugs/glitches.\n\n**First problem: Not actually playing the \"siege\"**\n\nWhether you are attacking or defending, actually playing a \"siege\" is not a good strategy.\n\nWhen attacking, it is best to look for a wall segment without towers (nearly all maps have one), park your army there, then break the gates with your cav/lord and slowly kill off the enemy units one by one. Actually storming the city is generally a mistake.\n\nThis just isn't engaging gameplay. Its a lot of waiting for single units to fight each other until one dies.\n\nAnd its not getting better when defending. As you admitted yourself, the best strategy generally is to not even fight for the walls, but only use them to shoot a few volleys and then retreat to a chokepoint with a tower emplacment or two and grind down the enemy there.\n\nIn both cases, you barely interact with 90%++ of the map.\n\n**Second Problem: The AI**\n\nTW AI is generally problematic, but the added elements on siege maps often just break the AI completly. It is not smart enough to concentrate its forces when attacking nor defending; it just lets its superior cav sit inside walls and getting shot to pieces; it clumps up units to absurd density, making them good targets for spells; it often just suicides any flying units including lords at the beginning of the battle. To be fair, the last issue exists in field battles as well, but the consequences are way different: In field battles, the time between the enemy lord suiciding and the enemy infantry reaching your lines is limited. In sieges, its basicially infinite.\n\nAnd before I hear \"well you don't have to abuse the AI\" - yes I do. For example, the AI spreads out their army across the entire map - what am I supposed to do? Place half my army in the nothingness to even the playing field? Or if they send in their entire army to defend a single unit entering the city - should I just ignore this clump of units and purposefully cast my spells somewhere else?\n\n**Third Problem: The bugs and pathfinding**\n\nPathfinding in sieges is just something. Again, this is an issue that exists in land battles as well, but has way more impact on sieges. You want to attack through a gate? Your unit can and will get stuck. You want to break the gate? The enemy will open it, your lord will glitch inside the gate which then closes again. Your units breaks? Yeah they are retreating through the entire enemy city now, instead of actually running away.\n\nThe AI also can't upgrade their towers for some reasons, making the supply mechanic somewhat worthless after a few minutes of time.\n\nOh, and flying units have a busted charge against any units on walls. I know this isn't technicially a bug (the enemy units take fall damage when charged) but come on - deleting elite infantry within seconds might look cool, but defeats the purpose of the game imho.\n\nOverall, sieges allow for very, very onsided battles if you refuse to play it as an actual siege, i.e. a battle where you try to defend/take a city. They reward or even enforce absurdly boring gameplay and take ages to play out, thanks to the huge siege maps. They are also very, very map and race dependent: Some layouts give the defender at least a moderate advantage, while others are pretty much useless; and some units get absurdly OP while e.g. basic infantry is all but useless. Just not a fun experience.",

This meme was never based on factual reality as anyone who played the game knew that you could take on a 2x force quite easily in a siege since TWW1.\n\nYou could unironically hold back the end times with one t5 garrison and t3 walls if you played well in tww1 (In 2 you could do it if an army was also garrisoned).",
