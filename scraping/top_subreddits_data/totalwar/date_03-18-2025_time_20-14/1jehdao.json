As in it's good at killing monstrous infantry/cavalry and large SEs. Ideally, you want to support it with other units, but that's true for every SE in melee.\n\nPatriarch on bear is a terrible comparison.

To have more sources of information. (Those 2 links aren't the only videos).\n\nYes, CA fixed most issues of the Frost Wyrm of that first link. But went in the wrong direction with it afterwards. It's a unit where design & stats don't match up!\n\nThe Frost Wyrm isn't the upgrade to the Snow Leopard.\n\nStats aren't everything. Tactics and roles are more important. And the size of the unit plays a big part in this. Animation too. Those aren't just looks, but what the game takes before applying it's calculations.\n\nThose are part of why I suggested the Patriarch (on a Bear) as a closer match to the Snow Leopard rather then the Frost Wyrm. He is a small SE and with the right items equipped, a better fighter, too. It's not a perfect match, he is a support unit, instead of a Anti-Large specialist, like you mentioned.
