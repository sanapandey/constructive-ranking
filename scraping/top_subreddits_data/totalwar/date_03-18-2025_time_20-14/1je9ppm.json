This isn\u2019t even mentioning that she guards one of the cities that is basically under constant assault from chaos and, even if a full scale civil war between them wouldn\u2019t seriously damage the city, there isn\u2019t a guarantee that the person replacing Morathi could both hold off chaos and keep the gold following.",

                                    "body": "It's more complicated than that. Malekith was raised to be a king and a commander. He favors conventional military might and legal frameworks to solidify his power. Unlike his mother he generally wants to rule the world, not blow it up.\n\nMorathi is more magically inclined and would happily unravel the Vortex to bend it to her own purposes. She is shown to be an absolutely awful military commander with a short temper, frequently executing her own subordinates for no reason, and taking bait at the slightest provocation. Instead she relies on manipulation of the different religious cults to maintain her grip on power. Malekith sees them as religious zealots and nutheads and really only puts up with them because Naggaroth would collapse if its secular and religious factions went to war with one another.\n\nIn the Tyrion and Teclis novels, Malekith threatens to kill her, feed her to N'Kari (it's arguably very strange that any of the Dark Elf factions in-game, including Morathi, can get along with N'Kari at all), etc. if she tries to mess with the Vortex. Eventually Caledor takes matters into his own hands and attacks Morathi's dreams to threaten her. \n\nThis is basically the latest \"canon\" interpretation of the characters, and I personally see the older stuff as being out of date and irrelevant. It seems that GW only made up their minds what the Dark Elves were supposed to be like only later on, e.g. whether or not they're Chaos worshipers, where they get their political legitimacy, how their society is set up, etc. A lot of the earlier stuff is quite frankly very confused about all of this because it simply hadn't been set up yet, such as the Malus Darkblade novels describing Aenarion as \"hated\" (why would you hate the source of your political legitimacy?), and can simply be discarded as not being canon anymore.",

I remember him actually having a bit of an issue with, \u201cwasteful violence\u201d, in the sense that he views 500 slaves killed in some hedonistic event thrown by a noble is 500 slaves that aren\u2019t growing crops or mining. In Malekith\u2019s eyes, violence and cruelty has a purpose and, while life is cheap, it isn\u2019t, \u201cfree\u201d, so, you should try to get something more than fleeting pleasure out of slaves.",
