    "selftext": "I never played Medieval 2 when it was released. Didn't have a computer capable of running it (same with Rome 1). I was 19 at the time and could not afford my first gaming rig until I was in my 20s. The only TWs I played before Rome 2, was Medieval 1.\n\nI have had it in Steam for a while, but it wasn't until last year I gave it a real serious spin. Now I come back to it time and time again. I'm writing this partly as a appreciation post for myself and partly on the chance that it might give someone else the same joy I get from playing it.\n\nIt is of course incredibly dated in terms of graphics, QoL improvements and AI, but I feel like it made me really appreciate some of the \"core\" TW gameplay that I feel have been watered down or lost over the years. It is in some ways more \"arcady\", but I really enjoy this once you get used to it. Feels like playing the older super mario games. It's simplicity is in a way what makes it stand up to time.\n\n\\- **I really care about my characters again.** Characters in Medieval 2 can get heaps of traits and changes depending on what you do with them. They all heavily influence how you want to play. They have reintroduced this especially in the Warhammer series, but I really feel like the immortality stuff kinda devaluates your characters. The fact that they can die (and frequently do) makes me care more about them. This also sets up some excellent scenarios where a shit commander has to defend a settlement or win a battle, or your 0 command heir having to go on a crusade and ends up with 8 command at the end. This is something that I have failed to find in later Total War games to the same extent. Such an excellent mechanic.\n\n\\-  **Units have actual mass.** This might sound trivial, but one of the biggest complaints about the current engine for the longest of time is how units does not have mass. They have worked around this in Warhammer, but it took them like 15 years to fix. It makes battles so much better.\n\n\\- **Sieges are fun.** Sieges in Medieval 2 are amazing. Both to attack and defend. Even its shitty AI will have you attack both the outer and inner citadel. Siege maps has an ample of choke points (as they fucking should). A big part of this is also the fact that you design your own garrison. Somewhere along the way, CA seems to have lost this technology and what we are left with is what has been prevalent ever since Rome 2. It means that you garrison can consist of units you think are fun to play with. It just seems so easy, yet so hard.\n\n\\- **Limited unit recruitment and replenishment.** Some people hate it, some people love it. I am in the latter category. I loved this aspect of ToB as well. It gives every unit a place. I will frequently lategame use shitty T1 units as fillers in my armies as sitting tight to recruit a doomstack of elite units takes too long and is inconvenient for replenishment purposes. This makes me care about my units, especially the elite ones since they usually cant be replenished until I have upgraded my conquered territories.\n\n\\- **All faction spesific units are fun to play with.** I mean most of the generic ones even are. I love British Longbows, Byzantine Vardariotai and Trabezon Archers, French knights (tbh all of them). Yes, most of them are OP, but thats OK. Especially since they come with limited recruitment (or recruitment pools). As long as you have this in place it doesn't matter that the unit is OP. This is the same reason every Chaos Dwarf unit feels both fun and useful; all of them are actually good.\n\n\\- **City management and population is cool.** I get some people doesn't like this as well. I love it. Very rarely will every city or castle have every building. It takes too long. You specialize them depending on what you need and where it is most beneficial. Population grows over time. More pops, more income and trade. This infuences the money you get from looting. Nothing feels better than devastating Venice as Byzantium for example. No more of this \"tier\" abbreviated bullshit of the later years. You can chose to tax it low to increase pop growth or tax it high to stop it. Higher pop means less public order etc. I really enjoy making metropolises in Medieval 2. I couldn't care less in Warhammer for example. All your cities will be tier 5 anyways.\n\n\\- **The game provides a challenge even after all these years.** I get that you can get incredibly good in M2. Like just stupendously good. Even so, if you pump up the difficulty I find that the long victory will keep me challenged all the way to the end. Between start to finish you have the Jihad/Crusades and 2 off-map invasions. Both of which can be a pain in the ass to deal with. I will frequently play until the 150-turn range in Medieval 2.\n\n**TLDR:** This game is amazing even without nostalgia and you should absolutely play it.\n\nEDIT: I also didn't even touch on the mods, since I haven't played any of them. That seems to be a world of its own.",

A low tier spearmen in the best armor can look identical to an unupgraded mid to even high tier spearman because of it. (Will still perform worse overall as only armor improved however).\n\nThis is also how the game kinda sorta models the passage of time as the first knights you produce will just use basic helmets and chainmail armor. But once you can properly upgrade their armor in late game you can give them full plate gear.\n\nHonestly a better system than just \"different unit, same role, but better stats\" like how newer Total War games do.",

Having a small army made up of maybe mostly cavalry and light infantry to go around and protect your little estates and towns from the marauding enemies. It also allows you to really heather Garrison armies instead of the mishmash of nonsense you get as Auto generated garrisons in later games. I loved being able to just have loads of longbowmen with maybe just a few cheap spear units to hold a really fortified Castle. \n\nAnd the main attraction of that for me is that you aren't just automatically going to lose because the enemy comes at you with a full stack and you only have like six or seven units as a Garrison. If you used your tactics and your defenses correctly in the older games, you could beat out a much larger Force. I remember one time I was playing as England in medieval 2 and I had taken Jerusalem in a crusade and right after I took it the Mongolians invaded and so I was basically just spending every single bit of my money. Fortifying Jerusalem paying for mercenaries and just waiting for the storm to arrive and it basically culminated in this epic battle where I had one full stack outside the city and one safely behind the walls. What I did was I sent the full stack outside the walls to hurt the Mongolians as much as I could which led to this epic battle in the desert where I spawned on top of some hills and was basically just able to ring myself in with Spears on all sides and archers just absolutely unleashing hell upon the horsemen. That army was, of course, eventually defeated, but Jerusalem never fell and it is still probably one of my favorite total War moments of all time",

Which also means extended campaigns require planning and you can whittle down enemy stacks.\n\n\\- The AI sometimes hits you with the \"Please don't attack.

And the way characters work is way better than the convoluted RPG system of later games.\n\n\\- Because units have mass and only a few hitpoints each, combat and cavalry charges feel and look satisfying.
