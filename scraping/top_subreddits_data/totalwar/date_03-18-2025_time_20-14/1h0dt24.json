And the Bloodbeast definitely will get used more than Warchariots (especially since Khorne already has two types of chariots).",

By a lot of game standards it would be but when you compare it to the character and story of trailers like 'Curse of the Vampire Coast', 'The Prophet and the Warlock', or 'The Hunter and the Beast' it comes up short. \n\nThis feels like it just wants to show you some new models and animations and call it a day. Having what I'm guessing are start position hints just seems really unnecessary and immersion breaking, leave that for the articles.

I think they went a bit too safe there and could have made his disappearing act be cause for him to start where other Greenskins don't start. Interesting to note his mechanic doesn't seem to have a bespoke button or UI so will need to see how that works out. \n\nOgre wise I like how Golgfag is in the north. It's a fun nod to his 1st edition lore about him coming from the Frozen North, before 6th and 8th edition had him be born in the Mountains of Mourn. Roster wise having a unit called \"Golgfag's Maneaters\" is a little odd when you're, well, not playing as Golgfag so that's certainly a choice. \n\nLove Skulltaker and the units are mostly as expected other than maybe the Blood beasts. Curious what role they will be filling in the roster besides just more melee brute force.",

I mean, I still haven't touched any of the others, but it's at least possible that I will play an Empire faction (other than Gelt because he rules now). So who knows, maybe Golgf*g will get me to play ogres for the first time ever, and if whatshisname has a cool mechanic then I could even potentially play an orc\n\nThe Khorne dude I'm not so sure about; I cannot stand that kind of voice, especially Bloodletters, and the trailer makes it seem like it could be very similar, but maybe he'll sound more unique in the actual game. That said I've only half played Skarbrand so I'll have to see what his mechanic is like too\n\nNo clear standout like Malakai, but I've always been fond of dwarfs and their machinery, so I might be biased",

At least give his model an actual face. Like, just a narrow little space in the helmet that isn't dark but you can see his eyes, nose, mouth a liiiitle bit.
