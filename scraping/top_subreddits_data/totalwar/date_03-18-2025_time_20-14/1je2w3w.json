Most infantry-heavy armies struggle to finish ranged off, so they fight them, ranged routs, runs away and you either have the choice between sticking your infantry to them until they left the field (something infantry randomly stops doing a lot of times too) or ignore them only to fight them later on when they rally and still dish out most of their damage.\n\nFaster than average infantry like WEs/SoS can break opposing missile infantry with relative ease since they're way faster. To boot they take less damage on the initial charge since they bridge the distance more quickly and give the AI less time to kite.\n\nSoS even come with shields. And as a cherry on top the physical resistance works against almost all enemies. Imo the weakness of that stack is SEMs and shock cav more than ranged.",

This will keep him off your back for long enough for you to consolidate power.  Recruit darkshards until you reach full stack.\n\nYour priority is now taking out Valkia, who will be moving south to take out Grond.  You should be able to take her out with a surprise attack with a basic stack if you position well.  You need to rush Dagrak's end and remove Valkia or you will be tied up in the north for a long time.\n\nAfter turn 10 your goal is to gain Hag Graef and Grond for their mines.  Clar Karond and Grond should be willing to confed fairly easily, but violence may be required.  Clar Karond and Grond will finance your next expansion, and after your econ is rolling you have a couple of options.  \n\nYou can go northeast and take out Sigvald and link up with Malleus if Har Ganeth is weak, take out Grombrindol who should be fighting tomb kings in the south, move to take Clar Karond and fortify in preparation of the high elf waves, or (my preference) sail to Karond Kar and take out Alith Anar.\n\nGeneral dark elf tips:\n\nUse up your slaves.  You should always be spending slaves upgrading buildings and on growth diktats.  This will allow you to grow very quickly and reach higher tier units before the AI.\n\nRush the +20% sacking income tech.  It is good with all factions and sacking is how you finance your crazy growth.\n\nDarkshards will carry your early game, but don't sleep on Darkspears.  Three points into red will make them hold against higher tier infantry easily. \n\nShades are great, but expensive and should be used in the midgame as single unit assassins.  A lot of people will tell you to get a shade doomstack, but I have found that going with more armies with spears and shards causes the AI to hesitate more when declaring war.\n\nA single hydra and bolt thrower in an army drastically increases autoresolve results.\n\nThis is my early game strategy with Malekith and it snowballs hard!",

Get the 50% upkeep reduction from the Black Arks and go round taking ports with them.\n\nMake sure you have plenty of unpaid interns (Slaves) and build the buildings that allow you to reduce the decline. I usually loot a building instead of occupy just to get extra.\n\nYou have decent monsters, reasonable cavalry, very good missile units and the melee infantry isnt bad at all, but won't be able to go toe-to-toe with melee units from factions like Nurgle or Khorne.",

Send that bad boy in just in front of your main line as a pin cushion to protect the front line while your ranged gets in place and you try the flanking option of your choice. It will get close enough to do its breath attack and briefly engage before its moral breaks and it runs away. That gives it a chance to heal and you send it right back in to help finish things off. I see so many players complain about low hydra moral when it's actually a good feature combined with the regeneration. I don't think any late game Dark Elf front line is complete without one!",

A stack of infantry + 2 ballistas is relatively cheap and will serve you well, letting you invest in your buildings and unlock your favorite units.\n\nAfter that, you get everything you need. Some monsters are a bit niche (medusas for exemple, use their ranged attack, it HURTS). You mages are powerhouses, especially with Malekith or Morathi.

They're far more vulnerable to enemy missiles.

Take enough of then and enemy cavalry units will melt. if you include a properly leveled glade captain, they will cause terror. I like using the shielded cavalry unit to intercept fast units and my hawk riders to join the fight in melee. Meanwhile, you micro your archers so they shoot single entities in the back. You\u2019ll be left with only infantry in the opposition which your fast archers and hawk riders can easily destroy. Elf armies are a lot more fun than wood creature armies in my opinion and we haven\u2019t talked about spellcasting yet. \n\n\nFor the most breedable elves, I\u2019ve had some success with sending all my ranged chariots and cavalry in melee on weaker units whenever the murderous prowess triggers. They will break stuff faster with those bonuses.",
