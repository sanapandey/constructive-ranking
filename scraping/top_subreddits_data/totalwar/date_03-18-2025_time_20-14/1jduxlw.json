The reason being is that great unclean one units are meant to stay within infantry lines or even soak up missile damage or take charges.\n\nThey are not meant to chase missile units, though you could still do that if you have no better option.\n\nAND they are extremely great spellcasters!!!\n\nDid you see the tech tree of Nurgle, they get buffed to an insane degree.\n\nThey could hold so much abilities that you can just not use any winds of magic at all.\n\nI love great unclean ones.",
