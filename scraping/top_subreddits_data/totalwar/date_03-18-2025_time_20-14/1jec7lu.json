Has there ever been any line in any of the games or stories or anything else that even alludes to an explenation? Is it dark magic, are they built different, is Naggaroth not that hardcore once you get used to it, anything.\n\nIf not I'd like to hear your personal headcanons.\n\nEdit: If Malekith hates the cold so much then why doesnt he change into a bikini? Is he stupid?",

The Dark Elves can deal with the cold and solitary monsters, not so much extremes of humid hot and cold and endless hordes.

Alith Anar is the only one who\u2019d want to live there. \n\nMorathi\u2019s start location is an intrigue story for people to write stuff about which was made a settlement for gameplay reasons, not intended as an actual Dark Elf city where people live.",
