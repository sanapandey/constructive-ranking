    "selftext": "I am sure that everyone already knows this but I discovered this by trial and error trying to get a good start with what the absolute bloodbath that is the Gorbad campaign.\n\nTurn 1 go in ambush stance and move Gorbad due north with just a slight angle to the left to stay away from the enemy army just north of you. You will end your turn with that army due east (right) and slightly south of you. Do NOT engage the army as the game wants you to.\n\nRecruit a lord in black crag and get 3 squigs. Build in Black Crag. End turn.\n\nI replayed this 4 times and every time the enemy army near you will tunnel toward your undefended minor settlement. Ignore it.\nBut you will also see a tiny army (3 units) with the enemy faction leader that force marched toward you (trying to get to their settlement). If you did this right they will just barely be in range for you to attack, easy autoresolve and they are dead because force march.\nSince you killed their faction leader you can confederate your green skin enemy with 4 untouched regions and a half stack with a giant on turn 2.\n\nI haven't played more yet but now I have more than a full stack on turn 2 and since you are so powerful you can get a NAP with Skrag for some money.\n\nI actually might make it to turn 30 with Gorbad this time",
