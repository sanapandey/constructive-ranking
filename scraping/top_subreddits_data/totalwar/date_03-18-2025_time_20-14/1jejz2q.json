    "selftext": "If I have e.g. a mounted hero with 85 speed, cold one knights with 66 speed can catch up to the hero even if they're both moving in the same direction. No interference from spellcasters buffing/debuffing speed, no poison, equal terrain. Then when the enemy cavalry catch mine, they pin them down and my cavalry can't escape\n\nConversely, if I have a cavalry unit chasing something slower, they take longer to catch up (if at all), and when they do catch up, can't pin down the enemy unit. The enemy keeps moving while taking minimal if any damage.\n\nOnce I had a lord on a griffin mount get stuck between two entities from a skeleton archers unit. They were able to attack him in melee while he couldn't get free\n\nSingle entity vs multi entity, large vs small, mass, etc make no differece. The only thing that is consistent is that enemy units can catch and pin down mine, but mine can't do the same to them.",

I'd say over 150 range if we estimate the average archer to have a range of 150. Enemy cavalry began charging my cavalry, I immediately moved my cavalry to run away, and they still caught up",

That includes units that behave like chariots like Keepers of Secrets, Warsphinx, etc. If you charge down an enemy line, and click the next enemy a bit before your unit hits it's current target, it'll activate charge on that next unit, charging through the one you're about to hit (which still applies the damage, assuming it has movement damage like that, (ex chariots).",

In this case, Cold One Knights have a normal speed of 66 and a charge speed of 100. Different units have different charge speeds, and flying speeds are a different animal altogether (and somewhat bugged right now, as they sometimes randomly slow down when given attack orders). \n\nFor reference: https://twwstats.com/unitscards?units=f%3D0%26k%3Dwh2_main_def_cav_cold_one_knights_0%26m%26r%3D0%26v%3D8131121218983144176&units=f%3D0%26k%3Dwh2_main_def_cav_cold_one_knights_1%26m%26r%3D0%26v%3D8131121218983144176\n\nRegarding the inability to catch units, that's likely just because the AI 'spam clicks' its orders - as such, its units will continue to path away from your attacking units while your units will often take a moment to remember their orders, or may just drop them entirely.",
