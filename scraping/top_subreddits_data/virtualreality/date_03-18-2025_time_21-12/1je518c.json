I want VR games to all have demos available so I can try before I buy. If I likey then I'm more likely to pay full price.\n\nTheres a reason game mags and review sites exist, games are expensive and time consuming and no one wants to buy a dud. VR being a small user base needs that cash flow much more badly. They need to always have a demo to prove what they're selling.",

            "body": "I think about this a lot and tend to agree with the hypothesis that most of the \"active\" VR users are siloed, which would totally align with the \"lots of headset sold but not a lot of game purchases\" data that seems to be coming out with closed studios, etc.  Just using Assasin's creed nexus as an example because it was reported to have disappointing financial results: (1) If I'm an \"active\" VR users but my use is playing Flight Sim every day, I'm not trying out Assasin's creed nexus necessarily; (2) if I'm one of the physics sandbox cult people I'm going to downvote and review badly; (3) if I'm one of the kids playground club users I'm not going to have the money to buy the game or my parents may say its too \"mature\" for me, or even if I buy the game I'm going to get bored by one of the first cut scenes with talking, (4) if I'm an FPS warrior, I'm hopping on every day with my squad in Onward or Pavlov or Breachers, don't have time for a story based game; (5) If I got my headset for VRChat I may not want a single player game and may get most of my enjoyment from socializing in VR. So that may leave very few \"active\" users who are really the core market for what \"should be\" a must buy for every VR headset gamer.  Studios who don't understand this may think \"its a no brainer, if there's even 5 million active VR users on Quest, at least half of those will definitely want my name brand game release\" and it may not actually be true that even half of those care at all or are looking for it no matter the game's quality.",
