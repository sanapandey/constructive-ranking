In your desktop virtual desktop app ,  instead of \u201copenxr runtime\u201d set to automatic set this to VDXR. \n\nI was under the impression virtual desktop would pick the best settings. In this case does not seem to be true. Steamvr for me was always the default choice. VDXR was a massive performance improvement for me, decreased lag spikes and fixed a bug in breachers for me that allowed the game to even work. \n\nYou do lose steam friends and notification functionality but that seems to be it.
