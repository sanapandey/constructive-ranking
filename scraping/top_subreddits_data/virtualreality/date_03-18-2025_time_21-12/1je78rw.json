Great to see developers already getting to work on the Quest Passthrough API.\n\n>This app uses frame access on the Meta Quest 3 combined with AI to capture and replicate real-world objects. You can copy many objects around you by holding up the classic \u201cphoto capture\u201d hand gesture. The AI API can identify and separate the object from the background and create a 3D model from the image.",
