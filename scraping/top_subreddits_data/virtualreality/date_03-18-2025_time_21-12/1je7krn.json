                    "body": "FWIW I spent the last week prototyping VR with Ray Tracing (Note: NOT Path Tracing) in Unity. Their implementation is both inferior and outdated compared to more sophisticated implementations such as Unreal, and their DLSS is still on V1 IIRC.\n\nUsing a Quest 3, the only way to get 90 fps stable in this environment (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/polygon-fantasy-kingdom-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-164532) was to force DLSS to be at 50% on an overclocked 5090. Note: I also tried creating a low poly terrain with instanced grass & trees (to approximate the kind of foliage coverage you'd expect in a lush, outdoor Ghosts of Tsushima scene), and that crapped performance even more than the millions of polys in the aforementioned kingdom scene (presumably due to overdraw).\n\nI tried all the standard optimization techniques, and they helped a bit, but the moment you try to use Global Illumination (which IMO is the only time Ray Tracing starts to really shine), it's a nightmare.\n\nI suspect running the same test on Unreal might yield slightly better results performance-wise, but I doubt we could use High Quality, for example. Would probably be stuck on DLSS performance mode.\n\nThat being said, I've been running these sorts of tests with every high end card since NVidia started with their RTX branding, and at the rate they're going, I wouldn't be surprised if either 60 or 70 series might be the first to make it feasible at the highest tier of cards, so in the long run we're not that far out.",

Sure you could figure out a post process pipeline to sort of \"clone\" 1 perspective but that would add extra time to render each frame meaning best case theres a delay between what you do and when you see it and worst case you get stutters as it cant keep up with the 90+fps. Its more of a headache because the 2 perspectives also have to be somewhat different (you can experiment with this by closing 1 eye and then the other and observing the difference in what you can see) so basically it would be a mess if not implemented properly and a ballache to get a good and authentic experience out of it.",
