    "selftext": "My kids were talking about wanting to play Minecraft using VR, so I\u2019m here to ask for advice before purchasing anything. I did see someone ask this question here 4 years ago, so I\u2019m curious if anything has changed. I\u2019m smart enough to know that I don\u2019t know enough about VR to blindly make a purchase\u2026.\nWe have a PS5 but play Minecraft on PC. I am willing to purchase Minecraft on PS5 if it\u2019s better that way.\n\nIs there a VR set that works with PC Minecraft? \nIs it better to use VR for Minecraft on PS5 or PC?\nDo I need a specific PC to use it?\nAny recommendations on preferred brands/models of VR that aren\u2019t crazy expensive?\n\nThank you for reading and offering advice!\n(Edited for typo)",

            "body": "The PS5 version of Minecraft does not support VR mode. PS4 and the original PSVR1 headset used to support it, but that has ended. The only way I have played Minecraft VR is downloading the game from the Windows App Store and connecting my Quest headset to my PC with a USB cable. Not sure if that method still works since I thought Microsoft was ending its \u201cWindows Mixed Reality\u201d service, which is needed for the game to run in VR. I believe there are unofficial ways of playing Minecraft VR without a PC by sideloading an old Android version of the game that used to work with phone-based CR headsets (the GearVR) I believe on the site SideQuest, there are games inspired by Minecraft that you can install directly on a Quest headset.",
