I can finally put my HOSAS to use (Only VR game i know of that can use dual-sticks). It is an old game but looks incredible.",

I'd love to have a similar game but with a more exciting visual landscape. \n\nOtherwise it's absolutely amazing.",

My one big gripe is that reloading is terrible, and doesn't work half the time, even when using the Quick Reload setting. It's frustrating being in a big swarm of zombies who are chasing you in a limited amount of space, and trying desperately to run while trying to reload, but it just won't work.\n\nAside from that, I'm really enjoying the game, though. I think the 1st was more enjoyable b/c the reload issue was non-existent, but otherwise, it has a very similar feel. Oh, I do like having Buddy be able to attack enemies and help you save ammo. That has been a fun upgrade from the first game.",

Has to be one of my favourite VR games, but I can't say I'm a fan of getting launched backwards off of things after jumping to them and catching with my arms. 9/10",
