    "selftext": "Maybe it's a naive notion, but with UEVR being free and working pretty well for so many games.....would it really cost devs that much to just have official VR support?\n\nI know that VR gaming is still very niche and completely understand why devs aren't taking the big risk of VR from the ground up titles, but the almost complete lack of hybrid titles is what's really depressing. No Man's Sky is one of the few games I can think of that ships with the standard version and VR in the same package.\n\nEven if it were $5 more to \"unlock\" the VR feature I'd be willing to do that. I don't know if enough copies would be sold to justify the dev time but that's why I'm curious how much additional cost it would actually be. ",

That will cost them more than $5 per person.",

            "body": "I make vr mods and games and discuss a lot about that with other devs and modders. Here's my two cents :\n\nDepends on the type of the game, the engine used and the features the devs want for the vr mod. Games that doesn't requires motion controls like racing games could be relatively cheap to make. But fps games and others requires a lot more work. And there's also the UI and how you interact with it to take into account. These could cost thousands of dollar depending on the game you want to port in VR to have a polished experience.\n\nUevr has been developped over several years, and that is for unreal engine only. This work could be worth thousands of dollars in itself. Since it's an unnoficial mod, it's not a problem if the final experience isn't polished enough or if it makes people sick. But for official VR mods, devs have to take into account the level of polish and comfort their game has. They can't risk making people sick or they'll have a lot of bad reviews, which will lower their global sales if their rating gets lower. Add to this the fact that devs will have to downgrade the visuals for the game to run well on most pc.\nAlso vr dev is freaking hard and takes way more time than flatscreen gamedev.\n\nAnd as you said, the main issue is that VR is still not broadly adopted, it's not a big enough market. So the benefits/costs balance is still not interesting enough for most devs to get in. The people making vr games, mods and experiences are still mostly passionate people that knows they won't earn much but are still interested enough to keep pushing that medium forward. Like me :o).

In fact I do believe it\u2019s been well over 2 years since I played a 2D game. I do love VR. \n\nThe cost of designing and bringing to market a VR game, including the increase development time seems to have a massive impact on bringing games to market. \n\nFor example Batman as a standalone game. Funded hugely by Meta and took what 4 yrs to bring to market? \n\nAs a developer (I appreciate the VR adoption issue vs cost) what in your view would grow this gaming market and bring more devs to the fold? In the last 12 mths we\u2019ve seen devs go under or reverse the decision to make further VR games. It\u2019s all well and good having the tech, but without new games we\u2019re going to see the medium suffer severely, if not die. \n\nAnd I\u2019d have to go back to 2D games. Not cool.",

Every person that tried it can see the potential. I think we're past the time when lots of people were saying \"vr is a gimmick like 3d tvs\". At least I don't see people online saying that as often as a few years ago.\nAnd the people that keeps saying that never really tried it or are not the targeted customers for such experiences.\n\nDevs also need some more tools to streamline vr development, it's still somewhat cumbersome and some stuff can requires to reinvent the wheel for each projects.\n\nVR won't die but it'll still take quite some time imo. And the first hardware that will reach mainstream level will probably be advertised as AR first and VR will be like a second thought for it.\n\nThe valve deckard could also be a right step in this direction. According to rumors : Fully standalone, but can be plugged to a pc. If you can play any pcvr games in standalone mod while also being able to activate a 3d rendering for any flatscreen game, it'll probably get more flatscreen users to get into vr. But I think only a low cost version of the deckard later down the line (maybe made by competitors, meta ?) could really bring a consequent user base. Valve seems to make hardware for heavy pc users, which isn't really mainstream level, but still a pretty good market noneless that should also bring more devs to get on it.  \n\nI share the feel, VR has somewhat ruined 2d games for me too. But I still reach to enjoy some from time to time.\n\nTldr: So yea, it'll keep increasing gradually following the new tech and lower prices imo.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not a naysayer. I truly want this to work. I want mainstream now. Or next year. Happy to wait 5 years, but I do hope that what you say comes true.

So the benefits/costs balance is still not interesting enough for most devs to get in. The people making vr games, mods and experiences are still mostly passionate people that knows they won't earn much but are still interested enough to keep pushing that medium forward. Like me :o). Imma poor but love what I do.\n\nyeah this is where VR truly is right now\n\nbut unfortunately all I see on the internet is people hating on these indie VR games, because they are 'mobile games' and aren't Valve quality like Half-Life Alyx of time and budget investment",

            "body": "It depends on the game, but the answer is unfortunately a lot. Part of the problem here is the expectation on the part of the consumer \u2014 providing a user with a bad experience is universally worse than providing the user with no experience, because if they pay for a bad experience, they usually come away feeling cheated. Why would you have spent development time creating a part of the game that half-assedly appeals to maybe 5% or less your total audience when you could have spent that same amount of dev time working on something that would appeal to all of them? \n\nLet's say, for example, you're developing a first person shooter. In VR, the expectation for a good experience is that when you go to reload a gun, you reload it the way you'd realistically expect a gun to work, i.e. you drop the magazine out, you insert a new one, then rack the slide if a round wasn't already chambered. For most FPS games, this would require a radically different approach to the way that each gun was designed, which would exponentially increase development time for, and I cannot say this with enough emphasis, an absolutely tiny increase in profits assuming that increase would exist at all. Remember, the cost-benefit analysis for developing any singular mechanic in a game comes from a question of breakpoints, i.e. which users are buying a game specifically based on the presence or absence of a specific feature in the game. Can you say that there are many, if any, VR users who would choose to buy a game if it had VR but not if it didn't? Do you think that number could even possibly be high enough to justify spending that amount of dev-time for given that the rest of your audience can't access this set of features at all? \n\nThis makes complete sense when you're doing the *reverse \u2014* i.e. you're developing a VR game and also providing desktop support for that VR game. Developing a desktop version of your VR game not only provides enough profits to keep developing the VR side of things, but also expands your community if you're developing a multiplayer game so the VR users don't feel like they're playing a dead game. This is one of the reasons why VR is going to remain niche for the foreseeable future \u2014 the VR market is just unfortunately tiny compared to the rest of the games industry, so developing for VR just does not make sense financially.",

Just having support in the sense that headset sees in stereo, and you still play with a gamepad instead of motion controls? That's fairly trivial, the biggest hurdle would be the performance hit. But a full, motion-control support? That's something else. And then there's games that just wouldn't translate well at all. Like I'm currently playing Monster Hunter Wilds, and I don't know how it would benefit from being in VR at all. It's unplayable in first person, it's barely playable in third person if you're using focus mode already (it zooms you in a bit more and limits your view). And there's no way to directly translate motion controls into a third person action game. So giving a game like that VR support in a meaningful way would be pretty much impossible.\n\nHaving said all that, yes there's games where I feel devs are dropping the ball by not offering VR support when the game basically begs for it. Something like Ubisoft's The Division series, for example. It's a solo/co-op PvE tactical shooter. Works in first person. Technically it's third person, but when you ADS it zooms in so much it's basically first person. Take that, turn it into first person, manual reload would be a bonus but Arizona chest-slap-to-reload would also work. And that's it. Tweak some boss fights that focus on third person. And boom, you have easily the best looter-shooter in VR currently, where loot system is more than deep enough to keep a player engaged for hundreds of hours, with built-in community tools like clan support within the game, dozens of dungeons with randomized spawns, etc.\n\nSimilarly, something like Elder Scrolls Online. It's a 10+ year old MMO, which means VR can probably run it fine. Already playable in first person. Maximum number of abilities on the action bar is 5 + 1 ultimate, which motion controllers can easily handle the way Zenith handled it. The game has hundreds of hours of content, and is almost entirely PvE focused. Just add basic motion controller support, Zenith-like directional swings to trigger then 6 skills, and that's it, you have the best VR MMO on your hands that people would pay for.\n\nWould these projects cost something to implement? Yes, of course. But it's doable. Hell, they can take the code, take it to some third world studio in Eastern Europe or Asia, and have this implementation done for peanuts.\n\nBut these are also big projects. There's also so many small ones that I think could be very profitable. For example, I'm shocked Meta didn't pay to port Deep Rock Galactic to Quest. Or make a knock-off. Seeing the success of Dungeons of Eternity, it makes no sense not to do this. On PC, Deep Rock already has a very good VR mod. So a full, proper VR port would be easily doable by a competent team.",

Essentially they hire outside programmers to add vr and do not do it in house.\n\n  \nUnity games are harder to add vr too. \n\nYou may forget there are a TON of different programs to make games in, and each program is different how you add vr. It's not as simple as add a vr camera, there are a ton of interactions, new angles to think about, vr interaction, vr graphics etc. \n\nYou are not going to get a vr mode for $5 payment though, because not everyone wants to chip in 5$ and it wouldn't even pay for it likely.\n\n  \nIt's much more difficult for a company than just adding vr. There is a whole budget and team that would have to take time to analyze the market to see if it is even worth it.",

            "body": "If by \"adding VR support\" you mean \"just put a first-person camera and let the player play like he does in pancake mode\", then it wouldn't cost much. But bear in mind that pancake games weren't designed to be played in VR, so a pancake game in VR would be a motion sickness hell. Besides, if the game is not designed to take advantage of the medium, then what you would end up with would be just a glorified 3D TV. i mean, what's the point of virtual *reality* if I can't use my actual arms and legs, having to hold a gamepad instead?\n\nNow, if by \"adding support\" you mean more than the above, then we're talking about redesigning the game so that not only it takes full advantage of the medium, but so that it can be played with a minimum of comfort. The problem is that the game designer would end up having to deal with so many restrictions that the game would be completely disfigured game design-wise. That's why, even after more than 10 years of the introduction of the original Oculus prototype, we're yet to see virtual reality becoming mainstream even among core gamers: the games just aren't there. And the games can't be there because the sad truth is that VR severely limits game designers (and I still stand by that opinion).\n\n(by the way: whatever happened to the GTA:SA port for the Quest 2?)",

I was always skeptical from the moment it was announced.  I expected that if we saw it at all, it would just be like you said, basically a 3DTV version of the game in 3rd person.  Everything about the visuals, world scaling, animation, character movement, etc. would not have easily translated to first person perspective and motion controls.\n\nI agree with you, the problem with VR is it's fundamentally limiting from a design and gameplay perspective, and most flatscreen games just don't translate.  The fact that some enthusiasts put up with janky mods just for the immersion factor doesn't mean it's a good experience.  And no AAA or AA dev is going to invest a million dollars to half ass the experience for a tiny audience, and risk the negative press.\n\nThis was all well understood, and frequently discussed during VRs consumer launch in 2016.  It was broadly accepted that flat-to-VR was bad and games needed to be designed for VR from the ground up.  VR enthusiasts only like mods now because we are desperate for content.",

Then you end up going back to pancake mode. Not to mention VR's biggest elephant in the room: motion sickness (and no, you can't just get over it. We don't even know what actually causes it).\n\n>The feeling of being in the world is no different than if it was a full VR game\n\nFunnily enough, I get the same feeling when playing the game in pancake mode. Because, at the end of the day, it's not about technology: it's about game design. I mean, there's a reason GTAVI is so eagerly awaited: because that world is so well designed, so detailed, that you don't play a GTA, you *live* a GTA.\n\nSure, having the technology and the design would be awesome but, sadly, the technology just isn't there. As much as ~~Facebook~~ Meta is trying to push VR to the average consumer, the fact is, the consumer already decided he won't accept nothing below the Holodeck. And I get the feeling that the same is true for a lot of gamers, or else Quest 2 would be waaaay above it's current position in the Steam charts.",
