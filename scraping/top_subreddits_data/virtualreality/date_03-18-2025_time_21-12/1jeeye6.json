Preferably it should be 22-26 feet and a USB-A port, it also doesn't need to have charging capabilities. any suggestions?",

It doesn't have to be expensive, just the right models.  The Virtual Desktop discord has a list of recommended routers at various prices.  I bought a gl.inet Flint 2 and it's working very well for me.",

And, depending on the USB cable you're using, the latency might even be *worse* than wifi.\n\n>While i guess it is kinda weird but honestly I think a headset that just off loads the processing power to a computer and just displays images to decrease weight/size would be good.\n\nThat's what dedicated non-standalone PCVR headsets are for.",

The one upstairs is for VR, and is setup in repeater mode. It receives internet from the downstairs router, and distributes it via Ethernet to my two PCs up there. Before that, I just had it offline and use it just for streaming VR. I got internet from the wifi router downstairs.",
