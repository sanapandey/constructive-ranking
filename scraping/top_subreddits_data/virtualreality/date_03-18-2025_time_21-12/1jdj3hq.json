The answer is yes and I just got the Coming Soon page approved, so please wishlist if your on Quest! Here's a rehash from the previous post:\n\nI\u2019m Ken, the solo dev behind BattleGroupVR! I built the first game because I wanted a space RTS where you could command a fleet from the bridge of your own flagship\u2014not just as some distant observer. It was an amazing journey, and I\u2019m so grateful for all the support from players.\n\nNow, I\u2019m making a bigger, better sequel that expands on everything I loved about the first game. This time, you\u2019ll be able to explore an open-world galaxy, take on missions, mine, trade, and grow your fleet however you want.\n\nI just launched the Quest Coming Soon page, and wishlisting really helps a ton. Please check it out! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThanks so much, and I can\u2019t wait to share more soon!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 META QUEST: [https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/battlegroupvr2/9386827918099701/](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/battlegroupvr2/9386827918099701/)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 STEAM PAGE: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3385960/BattleGroupVR2/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3385960/BattleGroupVR2/)",
