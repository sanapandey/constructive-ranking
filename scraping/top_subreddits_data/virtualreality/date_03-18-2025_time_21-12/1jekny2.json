The game my friends want me to be able to play is VR chat, but I want to be sure I'll be able to play it and have all the worlds and such.\nI have a pretty okay PC I will wire it to. I've tried reading multiple different threads and googling but I haven't found a solid answer.\nRyzen 7 3700x 16Gb. Ddr4 ram RTX 3060 12gb GPU 1Tb SSD AND 256Gb SSD",

            "body": "So the way the quest 2 works is it's standalone, you can run it fully on the headset (though it dosnt have as good as performance as the PC version). There's are multiple ways of using PCVR with the quest headsets. \n\nThe first is wired Quest link, which is just download meta pc app, plug in, setup, play with steamVR.\n\nIf you have good internet (preferably ethernet) then you can either use Meta Airlink (Not reccomended), Steam Link, or my personal favourite virtual desktop (paid).\n\nA 3060 should run just fine with vr, I've even seen a 1650 run somewhat well in vr\n\nEdit: Quest 2 isn't the best IMO and if you can afford it, Quest 3s might be best if yoyr one a budget and want a more up to date experience, although quest 2 is still a good headset",
