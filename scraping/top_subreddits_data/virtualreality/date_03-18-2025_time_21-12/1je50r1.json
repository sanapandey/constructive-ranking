Nitpicks: AI response time to being held up looks comically slow.  The spot where an NPC pops in in view.  The VFX emitters.\n\nI'd certainly give it a try.  Basic gameplay being very solid, and mission structure can really make/break something like this.  Consider erring on the side of allowing save scumming all over the place, or far more frequently than is the standard in this type of game, because the one thing that prevents me from completing games like this is when they almost inevitably get to a section where there's a mission I *cannot* beat, and the last save point requires entirely too much replaying to get to the point where I fail, and then it just feels like I'm being punished rather than having a good time.",
