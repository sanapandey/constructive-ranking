No strings attached, no budget constraints, and you can hire the best talent, use cutting-edge tech, and push VR to its limits.\n\nWould you make:\n\n* The ultimate MMORPG?\n* A full-dive sci-fi RPG like *Sword Art Online*?\n* A hyper-realistic survival sim?\n* Something completely off-the-wall like a procedurally generated multiverse sandbox?\n\nAlso, what kind of mechanics, world, or innovations would you focus on? Would you prioritize realism, social interaction, player-driven economies, full-body tracking, neural interfaces, or something else?\n\nCurious to hear what everyone\u2019s billion-dollar dream project would look like!",

If time doesn't matter, you can really polish the game and optimize it - Valve didn't need to hurry and on the technical level, Alyx is still one of the best optimized VR titles.\n\nRockstar also cares about optimization. Recent Digital Foundry video about ray tracing in GTA V Enhanced on PC concludes, that Rockstar RT is more demanding on the CPU than on the GPU and with RTX 4060 on max RT, Ryzen 3600 is a bottleneck bringing FPS to 50, while with a better CPU it can maintain stable 60 FPS. Most games have it backward and RT tanks mostly GPU performance and VRAM usage with only some more CPU utilization than usually. It's amazing that my friend with RX 6800XT can run GTA V Enhanced with some ray tracing features in native 1440p with around 90 FPS.\n\nAs for VR games, I was also really surprised with good performance of Red Matter 1 and 2. The first game has some occasional shader compilation stutters when you enter new areas, but other than that I had constant 90 FPS in full resolution, and usually it's not the case for me in such pretty VR games. The second game is even better in this regard, as there are no stutters at all, smooth 90 FPS for me. I completed both and I highly recommend them, although the first game is mostly walking, story and puzzles, while the second one has some combat in later parts of the game.",

So a mod system that allows you to change anything anywhere. The menus also are visible to everyone so you can show each other what you're working on which is really important in VR because you can point things out and fix things for them and vice versa. It does all the things you said already. \n\nBut one day 10-20 years in the future I can see kids learning from a neon virtual chalk board from Batman or Bugs Bunny as your teacher just to make it more engaging. You can teach mathematics, physics, and coding very immersively and literally hands on in the game design. You can roll up your sleeves and take apart pieces of code you're standing on that make the floor, or physics in general. \n\nThey play around with so many extra dynamics constantly there it's a neat little group of science nerds.

Seeing things that I haven't seen before. \n\nI think this is what really stuck out so much for me in Half Life: Alyx. For the majority of the game, it's like I am traversing through this highly detailed alien world morphing with our own. I put 117hrs in this game simply because I couldn't stop exploring every nook and cranny I could find.\n\nAlso think it needs to be a bit creepy combined with anticipation. Not horrifying or anything too extreme but, just enough \"I wonder what could be lurking around this corner?!\" to get my senses engaged with the wow factor of the world I am exploring. \n\nI don't need any major combat. Especially no clunky melee. I am damn tired of playing with virtual swords. We have tons of games with these and they simply don't wow the masses like we thought they would. I think there should be lots of interactions available but, I think they could all be curiosity focused and reward focused. \"what happens if I touch this slime?\"... \"Oh no, this creature is trapped in these creepy vines, should I free it or move on?\"... \"These strange stones glow when close to each other, I wonder what happens if I smash them together?\"\n\nAfter all these years and all these VR games played, literally own over 400 VR games between Meta and Steam VR, the most impactful thing is wowing me with a world I've never seen or imagined before. Unfortunately, that also means that I really can't tell you what this world needs to be like.",

And sure it is clunky at times and the true to game fighting isn't the best in VR. But it also has a nice environment but also freedom of movement and interaction.\n\nIf we'd marry a full fledged environments with nice pacing and decent enough of freedom to explore/execute game actions in a non-clunky interaction model it would make for an awesome game.\n\nNow add vehicles in a meaningful way and I'm sold.\n\nLone Echo is still the most immersive game for me where I actually acted as if I was there.\n\nBut I also logged countless hours in Elite:Dangerous.\n\nSo I agree the different world. The Vibe that it creates makes a huge impact in VR.

One thing I'll add there are games with not much detail but a consistent stylised vibe that just works. Virtual Virtual Reality is really well made and it actually sold me on standalone VR as a PCVR head I just bought Go out of curiosity but even with 3dof and single controller with terrible touchpad VVR managed to immerse me in the world and the story to the point I wanted to exit the game by pulling off a VR HMD in the game not IRL to stop playing.\n\nStill the immersion crown goes to Lone Echo... when shit hit the fan i grabbed the station with one arm and Liv with another so she wouldn't float away. Without any prompt from the game and ultimately it was inconsequential but I totally acted out of instinct in VR buying the whole premise of the environment and character.",

It's just, at the time, with basic neural nets, it was still really limited.\n\nThat game also had indirect PvP if you wanted it. Basically your home base had a circle of influence. And you could increase that via various things. And then eventually you expand far enough to start bumping another player's area of influence. And then more direct conflict comes in, where you can throw fireballs into his territory and stuff like that, but it was never (afair?) direct PvP.\n\nI'd make something like that.\n\nAlso, just because I have a billion dollars, it wouldn't stop me from putting in a cash shop selling different creatures. If they're cute and varied enough, it's basically endless money for me - lions, tigers, oh my! But also anything and everything from turtles to naked molerats. You can buy any kind of creature you want, and grow it big, and make it good or evil, and teach it to do stuff.\n\nI'm actually kinda shocked nobody's done this yet. It feels like a no-brainer (to me, who has no brain). You get to print money selling critters. AI has to be barely good enough to fool an average player. Basically a list of activities with like/dislike values affecting frequency. Some basic settlement management, where if you pick up a villager and put them down next to another villager, they become a disciple breeder and go make more villagers. But if you put them next to a tree they are a lumberjack now. Gesture-based spell selection of the original game would work in VR verbatim. Navigation around the world was by grabbing the ground and spinning the planet while you remain stationary, again ideal for VR to avoid motion sickness. You can pet the creature in VR, on PC it can be done with simulated fur and stuff, which would be fantastic. Add a bit of direct/indirect/asynchronous PvP for the people who want it. Maybe add some seasonal events (summer, winter, etc) and...I don't know...hats? A fishing pole as DLC? And just sit back and watch the money roll in. Sell a new biome as an annual expansion? Jungle, desert, etc., each with unique challenges and mechanics? You could milk that game for 10 years, easy, and people wouldn't get bored because between new biomes and new critters it would feel like a new game.",

Then I'd take a page out of the Rottweiners game mode from H3VR and make some sort of roguelike-like game about a classical totalitarian alien invasion scenario, think the \"V\" 1983 miniseries. Evil alien henchmen in helmets and spandex. Kind of a fun tone, not quite as dystopian as HL:Alyx, enough to motivate a fight. If hotdogs are good enough in H3VR, we don't have to worry. \n\nThe world map would NOT be procedurally generated but custom made by the same person who did the map for Satisfactory (perhaps also cloned, getting expensive), but with many procedurally generated patrols of different unique species of aliens. Missions would consist of infiltrations of different strongholds of increasing difficulty. Think Outcast - A New Beginning (which is a surprisingly good game), but with real-world guns (and some exotic of course), and an even more detailed and creative map.\n\nWhat I would NOT do is any sort of linear storytelling or great lore. Some of that might come later with mods or expansions. The game is the toy, it is meant to be played with, not tell you a super rich story. The challenge is to spurn all the tools of storytelling that movie making has given us and which is much too easily implemented in modern game engines, and which makes games look like more fun than they are. You would not be able to \"finish\" this game in the normal sense of the word, but there would be leader boards, and mods aplenty. If the player ends up locked in a courtyard in the first five minutes with someone yelling exposition from a window on the second floor people in my team are getting a stern talking to. If someone wants to make a rich story in the world, the tools would be there, but the focus of the vanilla experience is the game play, sort of like Quake 3 was.\n\nThe billion (cloning aside) would mostly go into finding talent in game play mechanics, scale up without losing direction, and making sure this runs on shockingly poor hardware, cross platform, as a last ditch to save VR.\n\nOh and there is an accompanying open source mobile app that films you and converts your movements to standard full body tracking via some neural network wizardry, enough with these floating torsos and hands and IK joint hackery.",
