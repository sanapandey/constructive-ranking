One thing that really sucks is I was a moron and didn't have a Firefox or browser account so I've lost all of my bookmarks. One that I'm really trying to find was a nice site that kept all of the streaming websites that still work up to date. It broke then down into categories for movies, tv shows, sports, and the like. I'm pretty sure it was called something like \"The ultimate couch potato list\" or really similar. If it was during a holiday little things would float down the screen, for example during Halloween it was a lot of little bats and ghosts lol. \n\nI've Googled a ton but it's not pulling anything remotely similar up. The closest I've found was something about a \"Couch Potato\" that is long since defunct. What I'm thinking of was not that though because I just used it a couple of days ago.\n\nDoes anyone know what website I'm thinking of? Or if not, one that is very similar? \n\nThank you all!",

Mostly everything is in English, they do have chinese, Japanese, German and French films though.  No subs unfortunately, unless the upload included them.\n\n  \nBecause of where the videos are hosted, some will have ads for Gambling baked into them, no way around it.  All the stuff I've watched has been good high quality.  As they don't host the files themselves, there's no way to guarantee the episode or movie will play, but my experience has been something like 95% up on stuff I watch.\n\nAn example of one that's a mess is Dr. Who - The seasons/series are a mess, with some episodes being linked, but not in the correct order, or there's a link, but when you click to watch, it doesn't load the episode.

There are paid plans but if you are on a huge budget a laptop will do you nicely. I myself, don't use TorBox for Plex but I've heard others do.",

Mine doesn't do that, it just takes me to the hosting site, where I can copy the magnet link. Is that supposed to happen? Or do I just copy the magnet link, and put it into qBit (which is what I did)\n\nProblem 2 is that I used the free ProtonVPN, but halfway through, Proton doesn't like that and said smth about not torrenting from a free version/server. Is there a workaround or am I being stupid?\n\nAlso technically not a problem, but the qBit said I was downloading at a rate of 0 Mbps, but there was stuff in the files it was downloading to (all of which were seemingly the right files)\n\nI checked multiple times and I am using the right FitGirl site and links",

Maybe this isn't optimal, or i'm missing doing something right idk.   \n  \n  \n  \nSo I setup docker containers for each Arr App in their individual Folders under my \"Valhalla\" Folder. IE \n\n    C\n    |-Valhalla\n       |- Downloads \n       |- Radarr \n       |- Sonarr\n       |- Torrents\n             |- Movies\n             |- TVshows\n\nAnd in example for my Docker-Compose.yml for Radarr I Used ( This will follow the same pattern for each Arr file IE Radarr,Sonarr just look at Linuxserver docker guides) \n\n    ---\n    services:\n      radarr:\n        image: lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr:latest\n        container_name: radarr\n        environment:\n          - PUID=1000\n          - PGID=1000\n          - TZ=Etc/UTC\n        volumes:\n          - C:\\Valhalla\\Radarr\\data:/config\n          - C:\\Valhalla\\Torrents\\movies:/movies #optional\n          - C:\\Valhalla\\Downloads:/downloads #optional\n        ports:\n          - 7878:7878\n        restart: unless-stopped\n\nNote in this docker file - The first Part of each of the lines of volumes \n\nIE C:\\\\Valhalla\\\\Radarr\\\\data is where the files/Data of the volumes will live on the host machine. \n\nthe 2nd part of it - The part :/config or :/movies or :/downloads is the \"mount point\" of where it will be an accessible folder on the docker container. You'll notice if you are trying to point a Sonarr or Radarr Mapping to it, youll see it maybe as /movies/ or /tv/ \n\n\n\nProceeding on -   \n\n\nI set my qbittorrent download folder to download to `C:\\Valhalla\\Downloads`  \nIn Radarr Under Download Client settings, I created a remote mapping  \nPointing Remote Path to `C:\\Valhalla\\Downloads` and Local Path to `/downloads/`\n\n  \nUnder Media Management Settings, I added the root folder and set it as `/movies` \n\n  \nit had given me a permissions issue trying to add this, so I went into docker container Exec mode and ran `chown abc:abc movies`   which seemed to fix my permissions issue. \n\nAfter that, everything has been persistent on reboots. \n\n  \nAlso, Radarr and Sonarr have backup options, So I really recommend using that.",

I usually cite TorrentSafe when I talk about them because it's the one I know best, but there are others out there.\n\nAnyway, it SEEMS like it's pretty much proof against any ISP letters / cancellations / lawsuits, and I don't think you even NEED to use a VPN with something like that.\n\nEvery time I try to start a thread on this it ends up deleted, and I've never really been sure why. Someone once thought I was shilling, but that sounded less like a rule being broken and more like a personal thing, so, who can tell? At any rate, I try to bring this up, because I really don't know and I live in the sticks where we don't have a lot of choice in ISP, so I don't want to take any chances with losing the one I have, which is T-Mobile 4G LTE. \n\nIs a cloud-based torrenting operation, like TorrentSafe or one of its similar competitors, really proof against getting sued or blocked by your ISP? Do you need a VPN to go with it, or is it just a recommended thing?\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know how it works, basically, you get a torrent link, or magnet link, and put it into a field provided by the platform. Then the platform downloads the torrent and saves its output as a .zip file, which you can download later from the platform. \n\nI had thought that, since you don't actually torrent anything, the parts that an ISP would be watching for simply don't apply. But I don't know if that's the case, so I bring the notion here to people who likely know a LOT better than I do.",

Because I'm just now getting my first Mac I haven't had any prior experience with pirating on Mac, Im not that familiar with the sites etc.\n\nFrom the mega thread the first site , allmacworld was flagged on the URL result so I went to the second one.

Connected to this concern, is I don't have the knowledge yet, and haven'\\[t seen it mentioned if transferring to a local machine is throttled.  I assume that like all the other seedbox providers, this is done via FTP/Browser download.
