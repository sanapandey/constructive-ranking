    "selftext": "This is wild, I've used a product (obtained legitimately) of theirs for years (Notion 5) that has since been phased out. Not a problem, I have everything I need to keep on using it.\n\n\n\nI've changed computers recently, and after reinstalling Notion 5 (through their website) I had some trouble entering my registration key. I try a bunch of things that might interfere with the connection between the registration server and myself, but to no avail. Open a ticket with Presonus, and their answer is:\n\n  \n\n\n\"This product is no longer supported, upgrade to Notion 6.\"\n\n\n\nThe only barrier between using a thing I bought is that they chose to disable the registration servers to squeeze another $80 out of me. No chance.",
