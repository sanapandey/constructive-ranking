    "selftext": "Over the past couple of years I cancelled all of my subscriptions, have setup a 54tb NAS, a Jellyfin server, and all the bells and whistles that go along with that for locally hosted streaming. Currently in the process of switching all of my online accounts to a new email provider with aliases while permanently deleting a ton of old accounts I\u2019ll never use again.\n\nI never realized how much they make it a pain in the ass to permanently delete some accounts; not just cancelling the subscription but removing your account entirely. I just wasted 40 minutes of my life with Paramount+ support deleting my old Paramount+ account because they don\u2019t offer any option for users to permanently delete their accounts themselves. I have now dealt with multiple other companies who did this already and 9/10 times subscription services make it confusing and hard as hell to do this or to where you have to do a whole conversation with their support before deleting your data.\n\nAs Gabe from Steam said \u201cPiracy is a service issue.\u201d and I absolutely feel that today. Much love to you all, thanks for all the fish!",
