    "selftext": "Cream Installer unlocks DLCs for games on steam. Ive recently gotten into warhammer total war 3, which has some of the most egregious DLC practices out there. I do not want to support that. From what ive been reading here and other places online though cream only really works becaude valve just doesnt care currently about pirated DLC.\n\nMy question is, what would realisticly happen if tomorrow valve changed their minds? I have a sizable library of games that I dont want to lose by using cream. ",
