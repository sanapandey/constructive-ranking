Haven't regretted the purchase as its a great program and it wasn't too expensive imho (\u20ac36,24 incl. 21% VAT). Stillusing it and I love not having the popup begging for my money, just makes me happy for some stupid reason. Just somehow satisfying and i don't really know why...",

You will need to look for that information on the developers website. Googling something like \"\\[program name\\] CLI commends\" or other keywords like \"options\", \"switches\". Or try Googling \"\\[program name\\] Windows 10 shortcut \\[keyword\\]\"\n\nNot all software can be added, and some can be tricky.\n\n~~I haven't used this software in a long time but iirc it has a feature to try and make adding things to the context menus a bit easier:~~ [~~https://winaerotweaker.com/~~](https://winaerotweaker.com/)\n\nI checked the above software and it doesn't seem to offer the feature I was thinking about.",

                    "body": ".rar is a proprietary file format , that is better in some senses but not by a long shot and for regular users it really isn't noticeable.\n\nWinRAR tells you you absolutely need to buy the license or else to protect itself, that way if a big company wants to use the format or program they need to pay for licenses or face legal consequences. WinRAR could technically do that to you too but they haven't done so with anyone in several years so I think the point is clear (note that the decompression algorithm is free and public so they also aren't going to lock your files).\n\nFor average users, .rar, .zip, .7z and other similar file format are mostly the same, .zip and .7z are open for public use so most people use those, .zip is simpler and faster than the other two but compress the less, .7z is considerably slower than .zip but compresses more and .rar is basically the same as .7z (except the algorithm is proprietary) but marginally better in some scenarios and some people think of it as obsolete.\n\nThere's also tarball's .tar.gz (or other compression) but those are different cause they don't maintain separation of files and folders, they basically take the bytes of everything you try to compress, shove it in a box and pack it really small, so it often compress quite a bit more but you can't peek into it without decompressing it cause it's now a single homogenous file.",
