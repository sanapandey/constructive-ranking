The campaign has started, they take it down now, and when it's close to the film's release, they put it up again, or they put it up month after month, pretending there's a shortage of availability on Max streaming, and it looks like something new when they return to the catalogue. \n\nOf course, it could be something else too, like Max going through a rebranding, I had read something like that that the brand could change to HBO, so they remove some products from the catalog now, and after the rebranding they put them back in as if it were a huge new thing.",
