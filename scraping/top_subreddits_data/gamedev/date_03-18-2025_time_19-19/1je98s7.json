    "selftext": "I've recently released my first game and, to no surprise considering I didn't market it, it's completely cold and the numbers aren't changing. I have no problem with that, I didn't expect anything after all. What I'm actually getting blindsided by though is the constant series of emails from seemingly real people and curators asking to get Steam keys.\n\nIt started right before the release, when a few Steam curators reached out for keys. I sent them a few each, I still had some from my testing phase so that was all fine. Then a youtuber from Japan reached out in a VERY suspiciously weird email, I checked the channel and while it had 2mil subscribers and was active, the content they're making is really far away from what my game is. It's a simple strategy game, and they're more into GTA and Minecraft. Still, I sent them some keys because why not. Nothing has come of the youtuber or the curators as of yet, no reviews or gameplay.\n\nI'm well aware of keys getting stolen and sold on re-seller platforms, so I'd assume that's what's happening here. I stopped responding to those emails, but then I got one from a streamer. They said they want to stream it with their friend, so I checked their Twitch channel. It had around 1k followers and the last video was made a few years ago, but it said they streamed a few days ago so I thought they just didn't keep their vods. I sent them two keys and that was that.\n\nAnd now I'm getting more of those, which I've also stopped answering. It's always \"Hey I saw your game and want to stream it with a friend, could you send me two keys?\" or something like that. I check the channels and they've all been inactive for a few years. The email addresses match the stream info though, so I guess they're stolen too. I wonder what they'll come up with next, like is the make-a-wish foundation going to ask me for keys for children in need?\n\nSo I guess this isn't really a post about asking for advice, I'm pretty sure I know what's going on here and I'm not sending any more keys to anyone. I'd just like to know if other people are having / have had the same problem, and also to raise awareness for this sort of thing.",

The Youtuber may not even be aware that someone is pretending to be him.\n\nNext time, check if the email matches the one in the \"about\" section of the Youtuber's channel.\n\nGenerally speaking, don't give keys to \"influencers\" you've never heard of.\n\nPR agencies have lists for a good reason. If it's not part of your marketing strategy, there's no point in offering keys.",
