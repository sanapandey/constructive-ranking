    "selftext": "Hey everyone, here is the update promised - in case you missed it [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jbfja2/somebody_made_a_website_for_my_game/)is the original post from a few days ago.\n\nTLDR: the .com domain for my game was taken, but instead of it just being squat on, it was a fully fleshed out website advertising for my game with correct links to the official stuff, but had incorrect and AI generated information about the game - it did not appear to have ads, feature downloads, or be dangerous in any way (which was the part I found strange).\n\nAs it turns out, the responsible party was someone I had prior contact with. They they reached out over Discord to ask about doing marketing for the project, and I had rejected them due to not being financially able and (from what I've learned since, isn't a valid reason) not wanting to market the game when it was still too early in development. \n\nIn the conversation through Discord I was able to verify they made the website and asked them to take it down in the meantime. They are certainly not a native English speaker and refuse to give me a straight answer. I told them I wouldn't negotiate a price for the website or domain until their site was removed to prove they controlled it and I got a \"Please give me a few minutes, I will be back soon\", which was their last message 48 hours ago.\n\nI have remained calm and professional in my communications with this 'person' to hopefully get things in order for a reasonable price, but any advise would be much appreciated. I have reached out to a lawyer, bought some other related domains (I can't buy them in mass due to financials), and am looking into trademarking it.\n\nI really appreciate everyone that responded helpfully to the last post - I've never had to deal with IP law, never owned a domain, and have never published anything. This whole experience, while very annoying, has also been helpful in learning what should be prioritized before going public even when publishing a very small and very in-development indie game\n\nTo those that thought (and still think) this is an elaborate way to farm attention for my game - y'all should visit this sub [r/nothingeverhappens](https://www.reddit.com/r/nothingeverhappens/), it would be a great fit for you.",

I tried to negotiate in good faith for a few weeks but the ask was just unreasonable.  The domain was registered with godaddy and was using a default godaddy 'parking' page that had advertisements on it.\n\nBecause of the domain name, most of those ads were for our competitors.  So I wrote an email to godaddy informing them that the domain was infringing on our trade mark and was generating revenue by advertising for our competitors.  I honestly expected them to tell me to pound sand but they simply assigned the domain to us (we were also a customer of theirs).",

I DO NOT host any with godaddy and they have been parked and locked down from the start. They also started doing free privacy so you can't even see who owns them anymore with contact info, used to pay for that it. Any changes or transfers need a code based on an email i set up on an secure server. ALL on auto renewal unless I don't want them anymore. At this point I own about 30 with a 1/3 active. Friends just zelle me the fees. I'm in the domain club so I get discounts with each purchase without a coupon code. They call me when I turn off auto renewal on multiple domains to make sure it's not a mistake. Yes it's a different vibe when you own multiple domains for sure.",

The AAAs with armies of lawyers can handle it, but often get caught paying the ransom after data/security breaches, too. They're the most lucrative targets and can get caught paying out hundreds of thousands to millions. Smaller developers get targeted individually like this and camped, in the hopes they'll pay, knowing there's little or no risk of retaliation.\n\n\nAlways keep your names private until trademarked and domains are purchased same day, as close to commercial release as possible.",
