I have the feeling that I am not doing anything meaningful, and my mental health has been deteriorating.\n\nRecently, I started studying programming and discovered a passion for another field: game development (GameDev). I would love to work in this industry, but I believe my programming skills are still too limited. I am creative, I enjoy creating stories, and I wouldn't mind starting in GameDev as a Quality Assurance professional to break into the field. In fact, I wouldn't even mind staying in that role permanently, but my real dream is to work in game development.\n\nEven if it seems like I\u2019m chasing an illusion, I wouldn\u2019t give up. I am from Brazil, and I want to leave my country using my Italian passport to find opportunities abroad.\n\nWhat should I do to pursue this dream? Am I being too unrealistic?",

Don't call yourself a chemical engineer with a passion for gamedev. Call yourself a game programmer with a background in engineering.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's no secret handshake to join the game programmer club. You earn that title by making some games and (optionally) putting them on the internet, which you've done. Congratulations!\n\n\nAlso, apply for the jobs you want. It's very easy to get \"trapped\" in QA. Build your professional image by confidently referring to yourself as a game programmer, and applying for game programmer jobs.\u00a0\n\n\nOtherwise... Yea, it's a bloodbath in the industry now. I'd suggest polishing a game to release on steam while trying to get a first job in Brazil before changing countries. Any steam game will help you get hired. It doesn't have to be good!",

            "body": "Your programming skills/experience will likely be a big barrier given the current ongoing layoffs. \n\nI work at a AAA company on a live service game and I've been unable to get a single interview at a different company in the past 6 months due to how flooded the market currently is with overqualified individuals. We have principal developers taking senior roles, which is a huge step down.\n\nI'm not saying you should give up, but you should absolutely keep this in mind.\n\nAs for starting out in QA, from what I've seen QA is mostly a dead end now. The only people who manage to get out of QA and into prog are those who come in with programming experience, have degrees and get very lucky. More often than not I've seen people become QAs as a \"stepping stone\" only to end up stuck after 3 years. I can only imagine this has gotten worse recently. \n\nMy advice is to try to get a software job in c++ or c# to build up your experience while you work on games on the side using popular engines (UE for example) Once the job market cools down you'll have a much better chance of finding a game dev position using your pre-existing software prog experience. It'll still be difficult, but possible. \n\nRemember, what matters isn't how much experience you have but rather how you compare to others in the job pool.\n\nEdit: working and grammar.",

Don't learn c#/unity unless you want to work in mobile. If you want to get a console  job then you need C++ and really need unreal .\n\nYour portfolio is not about making polished and pretty games. Don't care. Won't even look. No one cares if you understand the business side or if you have good art. We are looking at your ability to solve problems and write clean and robust code with good naming conventions that runs at frame rate and within memory limits. \n\nAnd you need to be able to explain all of it.

If you worked on anything half decent, sooner or later you'd get picked up by a studio, having already experience working in a team and on a proper game and engine.\n\nWith the current economic situation, this most likely isn't going to happen. There's too many experienced devs out there looking for jobs.\n\nStill, rather than going at it alone, I'd consider looking online for a mod team or small dev team.\n\nI don't know where mod teams hang out these days, used to be on polycount mostly.\n\nSmall and stable indie dev teams are also out there, look for indie MMOs or survival games or other small teams working on stuff you think you'd want to be part of. Plenty of successful small studios with great titles on steam, started that way.\n\nFind them on steam, Google for indie games in the categories you'd enjoy, go to their websites and email them if you like what you see. Like with getting any job, just be a bit proactive in finding yourself something.\n\nIf a project you're part of succeeds, you'll automatically have a job and/or some income and if it doesn't, you'll have gained invaluable experience working on a dev team and project that's closer to the real game dev experience, than doing your own thing all by yourself.\n\nIt's probably also more motivating and rewarding to work with a small team than to do everything alone in the dark. Being part of a team that enjoys what they do, will do wonders for your mental health, too.\n\nYou have the advantage over other jobless devs, in that you already have a job, and can afford to work on a team for free to gain experience. Some indie teams will also be able to pay a $100-200 bucks a month or so for your freetime talents.\n\nJust beware of charlatan idea guys with grand visions and an absent team that does nothing and produces nothing. You don't owe anybody anything, so follow your gut and leave if you don't like the energy of a team.\n\nGood luck.",

Have you had interviews?\n\nWhat I've noticed when interviewing for studios here in Canada is that they basically want you to already be making the types of games they make, because your competition will have something more appealing in their portfolios if not.\n\nThis means if you apply for a mobile studio, they want to see your experience with their existing pipelines (same game engine, same launch platforms, etc) and building systems of the games they're making. This of course makes perfect sense, because why hire and teach when the other 100+ applicants are better suited for the job.\n\nI noticed on your portfolio you have a big top down action game (although not too deep it looks like? What would you say your most complex system that you could talk about in an interview is?), as well as a turn based strategy game. So if you applied to work on a fps game, you just won't make it because they have other candidates working on FPS games. \n\nThis is all from my own personal experience interviewing in the current landscape. VR studios want VR folks, mobile studios want mobile developers, etc. It makes sense to me, anyway. \n\nI'd narrow your field of view and focus entirely on the studios in your area, or that you want to work for, and specialize. That's my two cents. I say this because [my portfolio](https://malikengd.itch.io/prototyping) is all over the place and my common feedback after interviews is \"You nailed the (test/interview) but we went with someone with more experience in (whatever it is they actually make)\".

But these folks already made it, and are just living life. No longer fighting to break in. \n\nThe reason I say this is because, just as important as skills are, your network is perhaps even more so. A few of my interviews have directly come from recommendations by folks in our position - hungry, fighting for a chance. Working every single day on their projects and portfolio. These sorts of people you need to have in your network, because I have a hunch that half of the jobs you apply for already have personal recommendations for those positions (whether they get the position or not is another story). But you want to BE that personal recommendation, and have the skills and knowledge to back it up.\n\nGood luck!",

I just wanted to share some thoughts based on my experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re starting in this field later in life, especially with more responsibilities, I won\u2019t sugarcoat it\u2014you\u2019re in a tough spot. It\u2019s genuinely challenging. The younger you are, the easier it tends to be to jump into something as demanding as game development. As we grow older, responsibilities pile up, and this field adds layers of complexity and risk. And if you have kids\u2014especially more than one\u2014it can significantly amplify the difficulty. Juggling family responsibilities, financial stability, and time management becomes a massive challenge.\n\nWhen you sign up to make games, you\u2019re also signing up for at least 5 years of working hard while most people don\u2019t even notice or care about what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s something you have to accept going in.\n\nOn top of that, the prerequisites for getting started are immense. There\u2019s a ton of stuff you\u2019ll need to learn just to reach the point where you\u2019re capable of creating an entire game. Think of it as investing around 3 years of consistent effort, maybe 10 hours a week, just to build up those foundational skills.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m really interested in following your journey! It\u2019s inspiring that you\u2019re pursuing something you\u2019re passionate about.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t know any successful GameDev professionals\u2014those doing really well financially\u2014who don\u2019t end up hating the process of making games. By the time they finish a project, they often dislike the game they\u2019ve worked so hard on. But that\u2019s not to discourage you\u2014just sharing a reality that\u2019s worth considering.\n\nIf your goal is creative fulfillment, making games as a hobby might be a fantastic option. It allows you to chase that passion without the added stress of turning it into a full-blown career.\n\nOne last thing to keep in mind: it\u2019s normal for developers to release 5, 10, or even 20 games before they start seeing any significant financial return. It\u2019s a long road, but if you truly love it, every step is worth it. Good luck, and keep us posted!",
