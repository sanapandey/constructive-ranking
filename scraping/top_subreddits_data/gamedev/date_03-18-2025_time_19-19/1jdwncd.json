            "body": "Are they copyrighted?  No.\n\nWill people side-eye you if every single term in your game is taken from another game?  Yeah, probably.  It conveys unoriginality.\n\nShould that stop you from re-using a few familiar words in pursuit of a new game?  Nahh.  There's only so many words in the English language, and people get sick of relearning new words for familiar, simple mechanics.  The \"Draw\" and \"Discard\" piles are industry staple terms, and have been for ages; give it a few more years, and I'd bet people will think of the \"Exhaust\" pile the same way.  It's evocative of \"something that gets used up\" without being too wordy.  There's not really that many words that do that, and I guarantee that any synonym you pick, someone else is already using it, too.\n\n...Maybe this is just me projecting because I designed Cobalt Core and we used \"Exhaust\" too, haha.\n\nAnyway.  I would be a lot more concerned with making sure your mechanics, as a whole, add up to something meaningfully different, at a core level.  Use familiar elements as a vehicle to get to a new destination, not as the destination themselves.",

                    "body": "One important caveat: In some cases, it's worth going for a weird/unconventional word, if it strengthens the theme.\n\nA great example IMO is MtG's discard pile. Discarding isn't a super-common mechanic in that game, creatures go to the discard pile when they die, and cards that interact with the discard pile are very often themed around necromancy, so calling it \"graveyard\" instead of \"discard pile\" makes thematic sense. Of course, that name would make absolutely no sense in Cobalt Core.\n\nIncidentally: Cobalt Core stands as a perfect example of how you only need on or two very simple mechanics (ship movement, in this case) to make your roguelike deckbuilder not feel like a Slay the Spire clone.",

They can be trademarked though.\n\nAlso, once upon a time, Wizard of the Coast held patents on basically all the mechanics in Magic the Gathering. We joked at the time about the absurdity of a patent on rotating a piece of cardboard 90 degrees, but it is what it is. Those patents have since expired of course, but I would be surprised if there are no others lurking. For guidance on specific cases like the ones you cited, ask your lawyer.",
