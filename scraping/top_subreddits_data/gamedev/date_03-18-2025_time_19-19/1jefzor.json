Or do you think automation would take away too much creative control?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts\u2014especially from those who have worked on indie or AAA projects.",

Maybe personally I didn't even try all the middleware out there that would help us.\n\nE.g. within WB Games and I bet EA there's shareable tech, by making them a part of the engine or a module/plugin. When I leave those companies we spend a few years again to build that stuff. :D\n\nThings that make our lives easier are e.g.\n\n* Houdini and possibly more AI tools that go that direction, creating, redoing, experimenting, and so on with geometry, animations, lighting, scattered elements like stones/foliage/trees\n* Lots of automated testing and validation  (testing more on the tech side, memory, crashes, etc, and validation in the sense of what assets we use and don't, where collision/navigation/game-flow/balancing/etc is broken\n\nAnd those Modules/packages we had:\n\n* Quest system with data-driven / scriptable conditions and actions  (mission/narrative/spawn/stats setups in a sense, simply speaking)\n* Open world navigation system including a higher level navigation / scheduling (mostly simulating both schedules and NPCs travelling / roaming so they can appear correctly timed/placed near the player)\n* State-of-the-art animation system with lots of workflow enhancements\n* Ambiant sound design tooling suite  (far beyond placing stuff, more like drawing sound)\n* ...and cool stuff like that\n\n...and yeah, the headaches as others stated, communication and clarity from mostly the \"design group\", which is sometimes fixed by a core designer/director and vision keeper or a core team (not 10+ cooks).",
