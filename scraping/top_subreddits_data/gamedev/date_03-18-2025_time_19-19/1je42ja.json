    "selftext": "Has anyone ever tested the market fit of a game idea through a trailer?\n\nIn my opinion, \\*time\\* is one of the most important resources a solo developer has. It takes a huge amount of effort to ship a game, even a bad one. At the same time, it's possible to build a decent-looking trailer with a non-playable prototype (everything hardcoded) or even solely through an animation tool like Premiere. I've spent close to 2 years on my current game, but I think I could have built a trailer for it on my very first month if I had focused exclusively on the assets needed for the trailer. I might have discovered back then what took me over a year to find out... That my game is just a \"medium\" market fit.\n\nHas anyone considered building a trailer this way to test a game idea before spending years building the actual game?",

First they make a bunch of ads and see which ones get the most clicks and then they build that game only. \n\nYou don't see it much in other games because it both takes a lot of work and gives kind of inaccurate results. However testing concepts, prototypes, art direction, and anything else _is_ very common. That's why often the first thing you do if you need market validation (or a publisher) isn't make a trailer, it's make a vertical slice. You do focus only on the assets needed but you also build the actual game, creating not 30 seconds of video but 5 minutes of gameplay. Then you test that.",

But if you do this early on then you have no way to know if your game is actually going to turn out good, and you might end up committing to gameplay that makes no sense and feels terrible to play just because it looked cool visually in the trailer. It makes it a lot harder to iterate on the game's design without lying to your audience with a trailer that won't reflect the final game. Works great for mobile slop that just wants you to download the game for 5 minutes and watch an ad before uninstalling though.",

It does have a upfront cost since you need enough data to make a conclusion and the skill set to make that determination. The important thing would be a polished vertical slice that represents the final product. Clicking the ad could send them to a page with a survey or a email sign up to let them know when the game is out.  \nFor a solo dev I would wonder what you get out of it vs the cost. You could end up spending a lot of time and money testing different ideas and end up with none of them having the data you would like.",

It was shown off as a multiplayer open world survival game with vehicles (among other things), and it ended up being an empty (quite literally, only two zombies in a single 5 block radius at a time from what I saw) Tarkov-esque extraction shooter with a weird base-building mechanic tacked on. When you have a game that\u2019s completely different than the one you enticed people with in your trailer, and you exploited this hype all the way up to release, I think it\u2019s pretty apparent the trailers were never intended to be their actual product in the first place.",
