    "selftext": "Yesterday I saw a trailer for a film that is the first AI-generated movie. This monstrosity was brought into the world by Staircase Studios AI and, if you haven't seen it - it's god-awful.\n\nI've grown increasingly concerned with the use of generative AI in this way.\n\nAs we've seen, generative AI is creeping into game development. Companies say it will save time and money. But what are we losing? Game development is a creative industry. Artists, writers, and designers shape every detail with intent. AI does not create - it scrubs, copies and rearranges existing work. It lacks originality. It lacks judgment. It lacks the human touch that makes a game worth playing.\n\nSome studios are already using AI to cut costs. That means fewer jobs, especially for junior and mid-level artists and writers. These roles are not just stepping stones. They are the foundation of a strong creative team. Without them, the industry weakens.\n\nFor job seekers, this matters. If a company is replacing human creativity with AI, what does that say about its values? Candidates should look at AI policies before accepting a job. Does the company use AI to assist teams or to replace them?\n\nPlayers also have a choice. If they accept AI-generated content, they should expect games to feel repetitive and soulless. The best games come from human passion, not algorithms.\n\nAI may have a place in development, but not at the cost of creativity and jobs. The industry needs to use it with caution and police it responsibly. The choice is simple: support studios that invest in people, or watch games become lifeless products.\n\nPersonally, I make a conscious effort to only work with studios and individuals that value the work of artists and creators and have it as a part of their development policy to not allow generative AI to be used. It may not be the future but in my opinion, where there's no heart... there's no art.\n\n",

But by \"AI\" I meant state machines, decision trees, text parsers, etc.\n\nNow marketing my game is a minefield of telling anti AI folks it's not generative AI and telling pro AI folks it's not generative AI and holy smokes I'm so exhausted from this conversation.\n\n\nAI is not a replacement for human creativity and I wish the world would just all get on that same page. It's great as a spelling and grammar checker, a brainstorming buddy to come up with high level ideas, as a thesaurus, it's amazing for reading crash dumps or error logs... but not for creating.",

My grievance is the pervasiveness on Generated AI on the artistic content. For any concept artists out there, I fear competent prompting may push your developed skill set into obsolescence - already, if there's an inkling of AI used in a portfolio piece that can be identified, your portfolio won't be accepted.\n\nNot to mention copyright issues. When I was developing the branded elements (parody brands, posters, automobile branding, - think of all the items you see in a game with real world counterparts from Coke to McDonalds, weapons manufacturers) within a AAA franchise, the legal department was working full time to ensure nothing violated international copyright and trademarks. We had to provide documentation to show process, where we drew our inspiration from, title searches, etc. - where does the practicality of a publishers legal liability draw the line with AI? A publisher could easily open themselves up to trademark violations.\n\nAnd again, this is more of a point for discussion. My opinion was made clear in the initial post. I do see it as a useful tool but it;'s reliance is unsettling - especially with the young people I see trying to crack into an already overly-saturated job market.",

We need to start getting used to it because complaining will only leave you behind, like the boomers.\n\nIt\u2019s simple progress\u2014it has always been around, and we always hypocritically complain about it.\n\nDo you use a train, a bus, or a car to get from one place to another? Do you buy vegetables, meat, and cheese at the supermarket or from a farmer? Do you get your water from the nearest natural spring? Do you use a computer every day?\n\nI highly doubt the Industrial Revolution would have stopped if all horse-drawn carriage owners had started saying, \"But we're losing jobs.\" People have always sought convenience and cost savings. I also doubt that those who invented digital information transmission stopped because postmen would deliver fewer letters.\n\nWe prefer to buy discounted furniture rather than from an artisan who crafts it by hand from scratch. Because it's more convenient and saves money. And there\u2019s an art to making furniture, just as there\u2019s an art to growing tomatoes or potatoes. Yet, we rarely support skill over convenience and savings.\n\nUsing AI or not isn\u2019t the point. The point is how it is used, how much of a work it actually constitutes, and how much effort has been put into the rest of it.\n\nJudging a masterpiece of a book as horrible just because it contains a single AI-generated illustration\u2014while the writer spent years crafting a literary gem\u2014is plain stupid. Imagine if Dante Alighieri had written The Divine Comedy but used an AI-generated cover because he was broke and couldn\u2019t afford an artist (and I'll tell you, even emerging artists aren't cheap). Most of you would probably claim that The Divine Comedy is trash and an insult to intellectual creativity.\n\nTry to change your mindset and embrace modernity\u2014otherwise, you'll be left behind and buried by something you will no longer be able to understand.",

We are already in the stage of people AI generating their books and selling it for a quick buck.\n\nAs for games, that depends on the game itself and your target audience. A free braindead hyper casual game for mobile ? Sure that definitely works for AI because the target audience is little kids and that segment of the market is open to any kind of industrial low quality content that follows a certain trend. But if it's an attempt to generate an advanced game with intrinsic mechanics and narrative in it like a JRPG or baldurs gate ? That segment of the market is just going to completely ignore it. I've seen many examples of this already, and there isn't a single one that I know is doing well.\n\nThe thing is, for the foreseeable future anything complex that you make entirely in AI is going to look garbage to everyone. It's not exactly because of the AI itself, but because lazy AI enthusiasts completely isolate themselves in their basement and make something alone without collaborating with anyone competent in their field. Leading to a potentially strange low quality looking product in the end.\n\nIt's not like gamers are suffering from a lack of games. People are 100% going to notice the strangeness of the product if a dude heavily relied on generated assets for their project, and it's going to subconsciously register in their minds it's a lazy product not worth parting their money with.",

We can have a debate about generative machine learning but we must do so from a position of understanding.\n\n>It lacks the human touch that makes a game worth playing.\n\nThis is an opinion and inqualifiable, but one I agree with.\n\n>Some studios are already using AI to cut costs. That means fewer jobs,\n\nThe second sentence here is not **inherently** true. Our studio is using machine learning tools now, and it has actually resulted in *more* jobs. The key is that we understand that these are **tools**, and tools are best used in the hands of artisans. A strong artist is made stronger by the computer and software they use to generate art more quickly, more effectively, and to greater detail. This is what these tools allow our artists to do. Tools do not replace artists.\n\n>If they accept AI-generated content, they should expect games to feel repetitive and soulless.\n\nThis is false and doesn't even make sense. Generative machine learning technology has been in use in games for literal decades. Not the exact same technologies we're seeing now, but still, generative machine learning (what you call \"AI\"). Many if not *literally all* of ***your*** favourite games use \"AI\" technologies. Artists and developers need these tools to make games on the scale they do, and they don't make games worse by any stretch. Again, the artists are making the art, the tools are helping them make the art. You can drive a nail with your hand but a hammer makes it a LOT easier.\n\n>AI may have a place in development, but not at the cost of creativity and jobs.\n\nThis is the key takeaway. It *obviously* has a place in development and it will become integrated across this and every other industry, just like all technological advancements. However, there are ethical ways to implement these tools into your pipeline, and unethical ways. Replacing creativity with \"AI\" is a failure, and it won't work. Using it to **assist** creativity is key.\n\nYou, in that quote, very correctly identify the nuance in the situation, that's good... But then you immediately after say this;\n\n>I make a conscious effort to only work with studios and individuals that \\[...\\] have it as a part of their development policy to not allow generative AI to be used.\n\nSo do you understand the nuance or not?",

Even photobashing requires a studio/an artist to have their own library of photos or a licensed pack to use in a product.\n\nCalling ai just a tool, and especially comparing it to these other things, is turning a blind eye to it's obvious copyright issues and ignoring that it should be regulated by copyright law.

Ai \"art\" lacks human intent, so when you don't build the artwork from scratch, you stop noticing when things don't make sense. I've seen an artlead approving an overpaint of ai that still had a fuckton of nonsense in it. So at least 2 professional artists that worked on that image didn't notice shit. Professional artists all over the internet post these ai images and don't notice how mediocre they are compared to what they did before. Look at Maciej Kuciara posting some ai garbage and praising it while it's the most mediocre lifeless shit ever. Or the recent situation with Ross Tran when he was just straight up lying about the use of ai but couldn't fool anyone.\n\nSo far this \"tool\" only proved to flood everything with more undoable garbage. And don't even get me started on how it's impossible to find references now. If I want to study, say, sea creatures, I have no fucking clue what's real and what's not anymore. Now every piece of image I find on the internet needs to have proof attached that it actually exists so I could grow my visual library as an artist. How fucking empowering.",

This monstrosity was brought into the world by Staircase Studios 3D Animation and, if you haven't seen it - it's god-awful.\n\n> Some studios are already using 3D animation to cut costs.

Does the company use a computer to assist traditional animators or to replace them?\n\n> 3D animation may have a place in development, but not at the cost of creativity and jobs.

Using advanced chatbots like we have today can fill in gaps in the process that isolated creatives wouldn't even tackle otherwise. Many would-be creatives have such an aversion to socialisation and having their work seen that they can't get off the ground because they don't have a mentor in the space they can trust. \n\nI understand the aversion to having content literally straight up spit out from questions like \"Example scene of two lovers having fun arguing\" . However, why are we stopping ourselves from asking something like \"given the themes of fate, choice and sacrifice, what are some fitting mythological figures I can draw inspiration from? Prioritize European and East Asian figures.\"? \n\nOr \"Examine this scene and highlight how it enhances or distracts from my core themes\".\n\n\"My past and present tense seem to be all over the place here, is it working or should I change something?\"\n\n\"Is my transition here too abrupt? Would a slower transition make sense?\"\n\n At that point it's a more refined Google search because it's not drowning in ads, SEO and clickbait articles. It's instant feedback that leaves the writer tons more time to focus on practicing and iterating, spending less energy on trying to parse through advice on someone else's work and see how it applies to theirs. Experienced writers don't need this but they have resources, time invested and connections. This bridges the gap in an imperfect manner, but it's better than nothing. Eventually a writer will begin to need it less and less, likely just using it for small things they shouldn't bother others with or using it as a brainstorming assistant that takes in rough dictation and spits out organized notes.\n\nChatbot AI, if used with care, transforms the ability to get productivity out of isolated creatives that lack the mental fortitude or connections to overcome some of the agency and confidence related barriers to diving into the creative process. Even some of the biggest publishers out there allow a distinction between AI generated and AI assisted works, allowing you to claim something as your own with no AI disclosure if all content in the final work is edited with care by the full attention of a human.\n\nTalk about throwing out the baby with the bathwater.",
