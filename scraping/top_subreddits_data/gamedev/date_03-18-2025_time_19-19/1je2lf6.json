    "selftext": "(I'll avoid details because if I was a scammer I'd be searching reddit for people asking about me and give fake answers to reassure the marks)\n\nContext:\n\n* A couple of months ago I published the Steam page for my puzzle game. I don't expect it to be a hit, because puzzle games are not that hot on Steam, but I have to say it doesn't look bad at all. It might be my best-looking game so far, even if that's not saying much.\n\n* I've since been contacted by a few obvious scammers on Discord, via DM. They start sweet-talking about my game even though they clearly haven't played it and, if I follow along, they end up trying to sell me some marketing service to \"broaden the fanbase\" or some such. I ignore or report them.\n\n* But... yesterday I was contacted by someone claiming to be a Chinese publisher interested on my game, and they offer me publishing services in China. It even looks like they have actually played my game.\n\nAdditional points that make them seem genuine:\n\n* They have a curator's page on steam, and a Steam group. The administrators of said group are Steam accounts that are a few years old.\n* They are listed as the publisher of at least one non-yet-released game (looks real and some people are playing and talking about it, so not just an asset flip they use as backstop to seem credible)\n\nSuspicious stuff:\n\n* They don't have much of a twitter/bluesky/reddit presence, though if they are Chinese that might explain it.\n* Their webpage is not available right now because it's under construction.\n\nI'm surprisingly inclined to believe they are genuine, but my paranoia is making me nervous. I think I'm going to keep talking with them, at least until I have to actually commit to something that entails a cost (llike a part of the profits or giving them money out-of-pocket). And even if they take advantage of me it's not like I expected to make millions with this game, so the risk is low.\n\nI need some advice here. What can I do to be safe and avoid being scammed?",

Curator's page is always a red flag.\n\nIn any case, rule number 1 with a publisher is ALWAYS:  \nIf they don't give you money UPFRONT, you shouldn't take in consideration their proposal.\n\nFirst: they MUST give you money. Upfront. Then, you can think about the other stuff they put on the table (localization, marketing, etc).  \nBut money is the only thing you can for sure touch and evaluate (for example, you cannot be sure how much localization will cost them, so you cannot evaluate how much they are investing in you).",

Good publishers have a lot of people vying for their time and attention, they don't have to go search for more people. \n\nIf you wanted to spend your time doing due diligence you'd get someone familiar with the Chinese market (and who speaks the language) to search locally for the publisher's games and see what they've released, same as you'd do for a global publisher on your own. It's possible they're legitimate and in that second category, but either way it's probably not worth your time. It's like the publishers that will contact you about porting to the Switch. They _will_ do it, but without a lot of care or marketing, they're just hoping if they port a hundred games a year some of them will do well and they earn enough from that to cover the low, lost cost of sending emails to literally everyone on Steam.",
