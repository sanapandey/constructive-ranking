    "selftext": "When I was growing up, I could have never expected the graphics that we have now. The detail and scale is remarkable. But there are also these really common things among character designs that I just can\u2019t quite grasp, and that really make me think that lower quality would be better.\n\nHave you noticed this toothiness? When a game has really good graphics, the characters also have really visible teeth, as though the actors were told to do more \u201clip action.\u201d\n\nI sometimes looked at the graphics in older games when I played them when they came out and thought that they weren\u2019t great, but man I think something like Morrowind has significantly better character design than something like the newer Mortal Kombat games. It\u2019s like everything became more realistic, except for the mouths, and they\u2019re so off putting to me that I\u2019d 100% accept them just not moving at all, and having to imagine them moving.",

The lips also don't meet enough or compress together at all which makes them look a bit like they're always keeping their mouths too open all the time, so the teeth are too prominent, and\n\n2 - It looks like they're just not shadowing the mouth sufficiently.

The face rig/shape keys the performance capture is being applied to.\n2. The lighting received by the mouth and teeth.\n\nChances are, the actors weren't told to exaggerate their lip movement beyond what's needed to provide good source data. Yes there is a degree of exaggeration involved, but not to any excessive extent. What you're likely seeing is a combination of limited facial rigs and lighting systems that don't do anything special for lighting the characters' mouths. \n\nEven with raytraced shadows and bent normals and all the bells and whistles, mouth shadows are hard. Lighting shortcuts that help everywhere else (ambient lighting boosts, capsule shadows, etc) tend to make mouths brighter; you can kinda-sorta lean on ambient occlusion to shadow the mouth, but the dimensions of your average mouth doesn't play nicely with screen space AO and the speed of speech doesn't play nicely with temporally sampled raytraced AO. You can cheat a bit in cutscenes by culling background content and spending more compute on high-sample-count cinematic shadow casters, but that introduces inconsistencies between cutscenes and gamplay. \n\nYou're noticing something real, but it's also something small enough that it often isn't worth solving outside of narrative-heavy games that can justify writing a compute shader for facial shadowing.",

To be fair she has prominent teeth in real life but she's not the only example.\n\nI know that some lip actions need to be exaggerated sometimes during motion capture or else it's harder for the software to capture their lip movement and accurately match with the reference model. Also because a lot of the time the lower face is not fully synchronized with the eyes and forehead, so it looks weird. The technology has been significantly improved over time though.",

There wasn\u2019t complex lighting with self shadowing and ambient occlusion textures. So it was just an artist painting something that tried to look good in lighting that was hard to make it look too bad. \n\nNow, there are geo budgets high enough that every tooth can be individually modeled. Or if not modeled,  the normal map makes the gap between the teeth strong enough to look \u201creal\u201d. And in lighting now makes the distinctions between the teeth more clear.   \n\nFaces are more commonly scanned now, but mouths and teeth are not an easy part to scan. Usually there is a single set of teeth already modeled that gets \u201ckit bashed\u201d into every head. If there is time, an artist will attempt to make them look unique to the face/match the concept. But good luck convincing a producer to budget time to something as small as teeth. \n\nAnd many art directors and/or executives with enough power only want to review models in perfect lighting and zoomed way in. So you get \u201cmake the teeth more white\u201d feedback - which makes them look more unrealistic.   \n\nSo it\u2019s not really that they are \u201cdesigned\u201d to look that way, it\u2019s just the end result.",
