    "selftext": "So, I have been working on this game for the past 15 months, it's my first full project but I've been noodling for years. Im in deep, probably too deep. Luckily I have a work from home job with a lot of free time so I'm able to get 10 hours a day on the game no problem. I didn't over scope (the game is very simple) and I, so far, have been able to stick my schedule pretty easily. I just started marketing, probably a little too late, and I'm worried there will be so little interest that it'll kill my momentum. \n\nI think my target audience is younger so I'm focusing on tiktok and reuploading to YouTube. It's brutal, the hardest thing I have had to do in this whole game-making process has been watching TikTok.  I have watched maybe 8-10 hours, while in bed or doing other passive activities. It's painful, it's a black hole of pain. partially because of my perpetual \"hello, fellow kids\" position and partially because I just don't get it. I've only posted 2 videos so far but I have five more ready to go up daily. The hardest part is finding the line, is the video interesting? Does it drive traffic to steam? Is it too overtly advertising? Probably.\n\nAnd then there is the game, the demo is basically done and I'm probably 80 percent finished with the rest of the content. I was on track to finish in 18-20 months (my initial goal being 18) but the game has been put on hold while I figure out social media and how to market this thing (if it's even possible). Now I feel like I'm wasting time grinding on something that will not make the game better or done. Going forward, for the rest of development, I am going to constantly thinking about if and how something I'm working on can be made into viral moment... \n\nI know how important marketing is, and I also recognize that it is actually a much more valuable skill than game development. But damn... The light at the end of the tunnel just got darker.\n\nFor those of you who can only squeeze in a few hours a day, how do you manage marketing at all? With that question in mind, I'm sorry for the venting. I'll keep my head up and pray they don't put a tarrif on steam games. It's called service dog, and it's on steam if you're interested.",

            "body": "Quick answer: Make your marketing tail longer, spend more time on it and launch your project later, you will regret launching too early.\n\nLong answer: You should actually split your devplan into proper \"pre-production\", \"production\" and \"post-production\" and put the necessary months on each phase. Going into a project and expecting to launch as soon as it is done being developed is extremely risky and not worthy it in my experience. Having the project sit around for 6-8 months just farming wishlists and marketing is better than launching it right away and making no money at all.",

Just take a look and pick the videos that sounds better to you, start with that.\n\nTL, DW: Marketing starts with the game you choose to do. You should choose a genre and style that people is looking for, that fills a gap in the market. If your goal is to gain money doing games, of course. If you just want to make games as a hobbie, its not important.\n\nGood luck with the game!",

Promotion is the 10% of marketing that can be done after the game is finished. Stuff like genre research, market research, competitor analysis, identifying your target audience, researching similar games, having a sales funnel, doing proper structured playtesting, and refining your game into a fun experience that meets expectations of customers in your genre. This is all marketing. And it\u2019s WAY more important than spamming on bird app.\n\nJust like your post, 90% of the \u201cmarketing\u201d I see on this sub is just spamming social media. And posting on social media is just a small part of promotion which is a small part of marketing, and it\u2019s the least effective way at driving wishlists. Social media is helpful to keep your already existing community engaged, and for connecting with press or other industry people for B2B.",
