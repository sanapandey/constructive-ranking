Server hosting and network stuff isn't, we can only see it works or doesn't from the outside. So, if your solutions works, if you could share some info on that, that would be really interesting.\n\nCool stuff though! Congrats for making it!",

                    "body": "Sure! I wrote my server in Java, and for my production server, I host it on Digital Ocean at the moment! At the start of the playtest, things were breaking like crazy and needed a lot of optimization, but now after 2 days of straight work, things are working decently well haha.\n\nFor a general overview of my server architecture, there are 3 components to my server set up:\n\n1. Login Server - Handles all login requests from players, and directs them to the correct channel server that they choose when logging in.\n\n2. Channel Server - This is the game world players actually play on! I wrote it so I can start up as many of these as I want, and it'll dynamically add them for players to select. I can even host them in different regions, though this is a bit buggy and slow sometimes atm, but it does work haha. I have US east, Europe, and Asia channel servers running live right now actually.\n\n3. Center Server - This server handles all communication between other server, like a central hub for communication for them. Login server uses this to communicate with the channel servers when a player needs to be direction towards one of them, and the channel servers use the center server for cross-channel features like guild chat, whispers, party chat, changing channel, etc.\n\nI may add other types of servers as well at some point to fit other needs I may have, but for now this is the current set up!\n\nHope that explains it decently well!",

It wouldn't really make sense for the login server to handle all that itself I think, since I'd want the login server's main focus to be on logging people in, rather than managing servers.\n2. I personally settled on this method after researching the source code of various MMORPG private servers. Some use the login server to manage everything, some just have all servers able to communicate with each other, but I personally like the approach of having one server that can manage and monitor the communications and state of all other servers. It gives the server one nice central point of control, from an admin perspective.\n3. And yes, if the login server gets overloaded, it could affect other parts of the game if it also handled the center server's functionality. For example, if it were combined and the login server were spammed, people in the game may not be able to guild chat, party chat, change channel quickly, etc.",

So I started remaking the basic features of the game and was like \"I'm having a lot more fun working on this in Godot than when I try to work on it in GameMaker sooo... even though it's a super tall task, I'm just going to remake it\" haha xD\n\nPlus the game got a lot of benefits for the switch as well such as:\n\n* Serious performance boost, FPS wise, and other things\n* Graphically the game looks a lot better. I think it's something about how Godot renders vs GameMaker, or at least how I was doing it in GameMaker\n* It's a LOT easier and faster for me to add new features because Godot's workflow works a lot better for me, and tbh I think it's just a bit faster in general. I was kinda struggling adding stuff quickly with GameMaker, even though I'd been using it for over a decade lol\n\nPlus I working with the GameMaker version of the game was pretty annoying for the following reasons:\n\n* The game wasn't optimized with delta time. Yes, you heard that right. I started working on it when I was far less experienced, so I didn't build delta time into the game. Trying to add that was the last thing I tried to do with the GameMaker version before I realized it wasn't worth the hours and hours of time it was costing me\n* I didn't like how GameMaker could just switch their terms and license stuff whenever. I bought the lifeterm version of GameMaker back in the day but now they're moving more towards subscription, and if I ever want to get the game on other platforms I likely would have had to pay more. With Godot, I don't have to worry about that obviously because it's open source\n* Aside from the delta time issue, the game's project file just wasn't organized or optimized very well since I kinda learned while I made the game. Starting fresh with Godot, I could optimize and organize properly from the start, which I did, and tbh it feels great haha",

The playtest is still running though, so we're constantly testing atm!\n\nI believe that with further server optimizations and lots of testing, we could probably handle minimally a few hundred players per channel, and then we can just scale to the amount of channels we need. For example, need to support 3000 players? If each channel can support 300 players, then you need minimally 10 channels, but I'd probably add a few more just to be safe lol",

Hmm my main inspirations when making the game are Old School Maplestory, Mabinogi, and Ragnarok Online. And maybe La Tale.

It was more of just a thing I felt like starting one afternoon for fun, to see where it'd take me. I'd been working on small MMO / multiplayer projects here and there for years, so this started as just another one of those.\n\nSo honestly, if you want to just wing it like I did and see where it takes you, I think that's pretty fine too haha, I just learned along the way! I had to recode a fair bit of stuff, but tbh that's part of the process of learning for me.\n\nBut if you want to plan ahead (as I certainly would if I were to start another project, now that I'm more experienced), I would say if you're gonna want to do a big project like this It'll save you time and effort to plan out a few things ahead of time:\n\n* **Determine what you'll use for your server and client.** For client, pick something widely supported and easy and efficient to develop on imo, especially as a solo / indie dev. For server, pick something that has good support for running on Linux imo, since Linux cloud servers are much easier and cheaper to get than Windows. Also pick something that has a good workflow for you for both server and client, so you can develop at a good pace\n* **Design your server architecture.** I posted about mine in another reply, so you can look there for more info but basically mine is a 3-server set up: center server, login server, and channel server.\n* **Code cleanly and efficiently.** And it helps to comment things. When working on an MMO don't take shortcuts, you'll like have to recode them in the future. When working on a large scale project like this, you want to make everything as clean, efficient, and easy to understand for yourself as possible.\n* **Build the server and client so you can easily add new content.** For example, make it easy for you to add new content like maps, enemies, items, etc. Maybe this is obvious and something you should do for ANY type of game, but I feel this is especially important in a game that's an MMO, since those types of games typically are designed to get lots of content patches and updates over a long period of time. Making this easy for yourself will save you a lot of time and hassle haha\n\nAnd that's about all I can think of for now! Hope that helps\\~",

For me I was able to test the game with simulated players for the whole development process. Which helped. But still, things will always BREAK once you go live. Even running the game servers for 12 hours+ revealed some niche bugs which I never encountered when testing locally (i never left the server running beyond 1hour locally lol).\n\nThe biggest beast is latency which cannot ever be truly tamed. Playing the game in real network conditions revealed a bunch of new improvements that were required. It was really demotivating at first - because it takes away from working on the game, and there's SO many possible causes to investigate. Is it the server hardware? server config? Is it a routing issue? Is it bugs in the client code? Is it bugs in the server code? ahhh.\n\nBut I have made progress. Hopefully it goes well for you too.",
