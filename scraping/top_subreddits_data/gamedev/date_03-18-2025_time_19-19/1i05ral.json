I have contemplated removing the latter, but I would be hesitant to delete a board that may be proving beneficial to individuals in their job search, even if both boards cater to the same demographic.*\n\n*-*\n\nr/INAT  \n*Where we've been sending all the REVSHARE | HOBBY projects to recruit.*\n\n# New Subreddits:\n\nr/gameDevMarketing  \n*Marketing is undoubtedly one of the most prevalent topics in this community, and for valid reasons. It is anticipated that with time and the community\u2019s efforts to redirect marketing-related discussions to this new subreddit, other game development topics will gain prominence.*\n\n*-*\n\nr/gameDevPromotion\n\n*Unlike here where self-promotion will have you meeting the ban hammer if we catch you, in this subreddit anything goes.  SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.*\n\n\\-\n\nr/gameDevTesting  \n*Dedicated to those who seek testers for their game or to discuss QA related topics.*\n\n\\------\n\nTo clarify, marketing topics are still welcome here. However, this may change if r/gameDevMarketing gains the momentum it needs to attract a sufficient number of members to elicit the responses and views necessary to answer questions and facilitate discussions on post-mortems related to game marketing.\n\nThere are over 1.8 **million** of you here in r/gameDev, which is the sole reason why any and all marketing conversations take place in this community rather than any other on this platform. If you want more focused marketing conversations and to see fewer of them happening here, please spread the word and join it yourself.\n\n# EDIT:\n\n* Added r/gameDevTesting ",
