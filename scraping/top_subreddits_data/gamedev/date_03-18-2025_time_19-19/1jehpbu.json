    "selftext": "About six weeks ago, my brother and I released our first game, [SPIN Protocol](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3342810/SPIN_Protocol/), on Steam. So far we've only sold about 20 copies, even though the game is very cheap and currently on sale.\n\n\n\nIt's a pretty simple game and not a super creative or groundbreaking idea as it was mostly a learning project; something we could actually \\*finish\\* while we continue working on a much bigger game (which is still far from done). We knew sales wouldn't be great, but honestly, we're still kind of disappointed by how poorly it did. We don't think it's THAT terrible, at least for a first game.\n\n\n\nSo, I'm wondering: Is there something obvious we failed at? Something that could have made the game sell better without increasing the scope too much?\n\n\n\nI guess the biggest problem with the game is the idea itself, which is not very original or interesting (check the store page if you're interested). The core mechanic was originally meant to be a minigame in our main project, but we decided to turn it into a full game after seeing all the \"make small games first\" advice in the gamedev community. Since we already had a working prototype, it seemed like a good idea, something we could finish in just a few months (and we did, it only took 3 months from start to finish, and we learned a lot in that time)\n\n\n\nBesides that, marketing was also a struggle. We made a few posts on gamedev and indie gaming subreddits, but engagement was almost nonexistent. We barely got any comments or upvotes, and the little we got was mostly people being nice, we didn't notice any real interest in the game. This was a huge morale killer. It's rough spending days learning how to edit a trailer, how to make music, and putting everything together, all to get like two comments and ten upvotes. After that, our motivation to market (and finish) the game plummeted.\n\n\n\nThe last few weeks of development were really hard. By the final stretch, we only had to fix some bugs, create a few more levels, and polish things up, but our motivation was gone. We knew the game wasn't going to sell well (we only had around 150 wishlists before launch) but we couldn't just abandon it so close to the finish line. We did push through, but those last few levels got way less playtesting and polish as a result. We also did a little more marketing, more reddit posts with some promotional videos showcasing game mechanics, but these didn't make any difference either.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day I don't know if this project was doomed from the start or if we just didn't do enough to find an audience. Maybe no amount of marketing could have saved it. Maybe the pixel art wasn't appealing. Maybe the music I made for the promotional videos was awful. Maybe the game was extremely boring and ugly but we just couldn't tell.\n\n\n\nI know effort doesn't guarantee success, and we weren't expecting a hit, but I can't help but feel like the game didn't reach its full potential. Is 20 sales in six weeks normal for a small indie game like this, or is this a huge failure?",

Did you let those that's into puzzle game know about this?\n\nAnd how many were you expecting to sell? Like honestly, as a no name just starting, being able to sell 20 in this niche topic probably means those 20 really wants to try your game and I'd be proud of that fact that you can manage that\n\nOne final thing, the trailer is also kinda... not too engaging? You just kinda show you can do this and that but with not much fanfare and the music was droning in the background. It also doesn't really show what exactly am I supposed to be doing. Do I make a white somewhere or do I connect certain color to certain panel? (I'm assuming the latter to the panel with 3 bars or something in it, but again it's just not too clear in a glance, could show those bar fill up to tell the player that yes, you have achieved your goal and have those rush for managing to figure out the puzzle)",

If you have learned something from making the game then I would say that was a success.\n\nNow if you're trying to make a learning project and also have it be a financial success it's just going to be nearly impossible.\n\nBut besides that I have a few things I can mention. The game looks like it could be fun once you start playing but that isn't going to get people to buy it. It could be the most fun game in existance but unless it's marketed properly it's never going to succeed.\n\nAnd when I say marketing I know you said you posted it online but that's not going to work if the game itself isn't marketable.\n\nA little secret I learned is marketing is not just an afterthought, it's part of the game design itself. The game needs to be designed to be appealing. \nImagine being someone looking at your trailer. They see some colours and lines and a black background. Honestly kind of boring. Now imagine what an amazing trailer would look like for your game and implement these changes! \n\nNow look at peggle for example. There's flashing colours, intense music, effects and all sorts to draw the user's eye in. And at the end of the day peggle is just shooting balls at pegs and you get a score. It's kind of boring when you put it like that but the game is designed to be appealing and draw in players before the game even begins.\n\nAnother example is Balatro. If you break it down it's literally just multiplying numbers together but it's designed in a way that makes it appealing regardless, like how everything pitches up and gets faster and flames start appearing on the score.\n\nYour game could be great but it lacks any flair.

I've tried them all: Hidden object games, Sudoku, Picross/Nonograms, logic problems, jigsaws, sliding squares, lasers and mirrors, escape rooms, etc.   Even a few colored line puzzles similar to yours.  \n\nAnd so I say this with kindness and respect: I'm not ever buying your game.  It's not about the price-- I'm a millionaire, but I wouldn't play this game for free.  \n\n>So, I'm wondering: Is there something obvious we failed at? Something that could have made the game sell better without increasing the scope too much?\n\nNo I don't think any amount of marketing and promotion, artwork changes or minor tweaks would change my answer.  Assuming the game you released is the game you yourself wanted to play and desired for others to play, I'll just say that there's nothing you could have done differently: I'm never buying this game.  And I'm the target audience; I'll even replay certain Gemcraft games because I enjoy the 'trial' puzzle levels, and I'll play certain time-management and hidden-object games because I enjoy certain mini-games.  \n\nBut the reviews of your game are damning.  One thumbs down, one thumbs up after .1 hours of game play, then another hour and never played again, and finally Anokturnus' review after 3 hours of playing which can be summed up as 'half-baked idea not executed well and with the wrong focus.'  Yeah, it's immediately obvious to me that you guys aren't puzzle-lovers the way I am and only made the game you made because you could make it, not because you love the puzzle genre.  \n\nEdit: yes, I just double-checked what you yourself wrote: \n\n>I guess the biggest problem with the game is the idea itself, which is not very original or interesting (check the store page if you're interested).\n\n>\n\nSee, this is where you wrong.  I love games like this-- laser games, loop games, even the bits in SHAPEZ where you mix colors-- and find it inherently interesting.  The very fact that you don't and simply didn't make the FPS or Action game you wanted to make due to a lack of talent and ability gives you no right to make a half-hearted game in a genre you find boring, then wonder why it's not selling.  \n\n**Simply put: if you don't find your game original or interesting, why should anyone else?**",

You're just making wild assumptions here. The original idea for the game came from The Talos Principle, where the laser puzzles were my favorites, and in the sequel they introduce these items that can mix red and blue to create green, and accumulators that can store colors. This, along with the hacking minigames/puzzles from Watch Dogs were the main inspiration for this mechanic.\n\nAnd yes, this was originally a minigame for another project. I'm still working on that project, and this mechanic will be in it. But it's not an action game or FPS, it's still a puzzle-adjacent game, specifically a first-person exploration game with immersive sim elements.\n\nI now consider the game not very interesting, but that's in retrospect. At the moment it seemed like a good idea with potential. And during development I actually had fun while creating and testing the levels.\n\nIt wasn't a 'half-hearted' effort. I put in the work because I believed in the idea at the time. That said, I appreciate the feedback, even if I don\u2019t agree with all of your conclusions.",

Graphics are not \\*bad\\* but they do not look like anything recognizable to me.  Game trailers should immediately convey what the game is like to play, and I am having trouble understanding the gameplay.  This could be the most amazing game, but it is so different than anything else that my brain just can't appreciate what it would be like to play it, hence I probably would not try it. \n\nNow, just as an idea, and this is off the top of my head.  Imagine the player is doing all the same stuff, same basic controls, but instead of just \"solving a puzzle\" by spinning these switches, there is a little guy that can jump from one switch to another, and you animate that character turning the switches, causing the lasers (or whatever they are) to end up zapping the boss at the end of the room. \n\nSame basic mechanics, but something more tangible for viewers to identify with.  Just an idea.  Not saying it's a good one.  But I think adding a human element, and some kind of stakes to the gameplay, could go a ways towards grabbing people's interest.",

I'm not saying you should build the game based on likes, but it can be a good metric to help see which features people seem to like, and what they ignore.\n\nStarting small is good advice, but there is a more important piece of advice, which is to make the game YOU want to play.
