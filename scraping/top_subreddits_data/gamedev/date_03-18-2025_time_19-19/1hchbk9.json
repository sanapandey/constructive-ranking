Free open source.\n* Unity:  Great for both 2d and 3d games. Free until you make over $200,000 in 12 months, then you need to pay a fixed price per year and developer. Had some bad press lately due to trying to shake down extremely successful developers for extra money, but still the most widely used and widely recommended game engine.\n* Unreal: Great for 3d, not so good but usable for 2d. Free until a game makes over $1 million in a year, then 5% royalty on every additional dollar.\n\nSome specialized game engines that are great for one specific type of game and very easy to learn:\n\n* Ren'Py for visual novels. Free open source.\n* RPGMaker for 16bit-nostalgia JRPGs. One-time purchase.\n\nYou want more options? Check the game engine FAQ linked above.",

                                    "body": "Personally, I would advise people to steer well clear.\n\nGML, the language GameMaker uses, has been designed with a single objective in mind: to get something happening on screen as quickly as possible with the minimum of preparatory learning. You don't need to wrap your head around classes or types, for example.\n\nThe tradeoffs for that initial lack of friction, unfortunately, will haunt you forever. Here's why.\n\nWhen you are programming, you will make mistakes. That's just a given. Your finger will slip, or you'll type the wrong thing. What you want from the language you are using is to be told *as soon as possible* when that happens. It is no exaggeration to say that can mean the difference between it taking a couple of seconds to fix, and a couple of weeks.\n\nSuppose I unintentionally type:\n\n    heallth = 50;\n\nWorking in a mature IDE such as Visual Studio Code and a fairly strict language such as C#, **heallth** would instantly be highlighted as a typo, and any attempt to compile the game would fail. If I'm working in Unity, I would see an informative compile error in the console and clicking on it would lead me directly to the problem. In practice, the only simple mistakes that the IDE or compiler can have trouble pinpointing for you are missing or extra curly braces, because there may be several candidate solutions.\n\nIn GameMaker, I would be able to compile, run - hell, release my game on Steam - without it ever warning me that I'd typed an extra 'l'.\n\nImagine a similar error in code that handles some rare edge case or situation that is laborious and time-consuming to recreate. The situation happens - and doesn't play out as expected. Why? At what point in the last few minutes or hours was a value not assigned correctly? Where in the code is it happening? Even if I know which variable isn't being set, how can I search the code for a typo of that variable?\n\nAnd that's just the tip of a very, very nasty iceberg. GameMaker won't so much as raise an eyebrow if you assign values of different types to the same variable. Make a mistake in some edge-case function call and you could find a struct replaced with a string or a number, and the first you'll know about it is when people are sharing screenshots of errors like \"Unable to get variable blah from object 0x43283472112345\". Good luck fixing *that*.\n\nVirtually ensuring that this kind of thing will happen are the ~~cool~~ terrifying language features such as 'with', a keyword that changes the meaning of every line of code that follows it *and the meaning of every line of code in functions called from that section.* Even if I spell 'health' correctly, *how the hell can I be sure what I'm setting the health of?*\n\nI have never encountered a language so actively hostile to safe, clean medium-to-large-scale development. It's a dark field at the edge of a cliff on a moonless night, full of rakes and bear-traps and ticks, and there should be massive warning signs erected around it.",

If you go for high definition rendering, then you also need high definition assets, and a lot of them. That's just out of reach for most teams. If you want to know what happens if a team goes for realistic graphics without having the necessary development resources, look at *Lord of the Rings: Gollum*.",

Sure you could make another 2D platfomer mario clone with little to no problems but if you want to have gameplay mechanics that's not very common, you will have an extra hard time trying to figure things out from zero in Godot.

Do the official \"beginner tutorial\" or \"getting started\" guide you are going to find there. \"Doing\" a tutorial means not just to watch some content. It means to replicate what you see in the game engine, and then before you go to the next chapter to see if you leaned something by experimenting with the stuff you did and see if you can get it to behave slightly different.\n3. (optional) if you never programmed before and the tutorial has you write a lot of program code, then you might feel very confused and overwhelmed by all those strange notations. In that case it might be useful to set the game engine away for now and learn some programming first. Google for a tutorial for the programming language used by the engine that is aimed at complete programming beginners. This might give you a better foundation for learning game development using a game engine.\n4. After you finished doing (not just reading/watching) the official tutorial, look for the official documentation of the game engine. You are going to find it somewhere on the website. You don't have to read it completely, but you should read through all the headlines. This should give you a general idea of all the things the game engine can do.\n5. Pick the chapters that sound useful for your own game idea. Read them more carefully. Build a test project to try out the features described in the documentation.\n\n~~If~~ when you get stuck with weird error message, don't understand something from the documentation, are not sure if a specific game engine feature is the best way to do something or if you have some other question: **google it!** You are not the first person learning this, so there is a very high chance that whatever question you have, someone had it before, asked it on the Internet, and received a helpful answer.",

Everyone is different so your milage may vary this is just what has worked well for me.\n\nAnyway here's the method:\n\n1. try it on your own (skip this step if you don't even know where to start)\n2. look at the documentation. This gives a base understanding so you can retain information better on the next steps.\n3. Watch a tutorial. Don't do anything yet just watch and pay close attention.\n4. The most important step is teaching it to someone or something. You can teach it to a friend or just an inanimate object on your desk I use a little turtle plushie lol. My theory for why this works so well is when you teach it to someone it forces you to find everything you don't know and also reinforces what you do know. (if you get stuck during the explanation refer back to the tutorial.)\n5. Try again to make it on your own. Make sure to deviate from the tutorial.\n\nI've been doing this for a few months now and it has saved me countless hours of rewatching tutorials. It allowed me to have a much deeper understanding of the fundamentals which I have noticed I can now apply in many more situations than before.\n\nI hope this helps on your game dev journey! If you have anything to add I would love to hear it.",

I also am a huge fan of unreal and think it would be cool to learn but I want to learn how to do 3D and 2D, I\u2019ve heard unreal isn\u2019t really that well suited to 2D, and I\u2019d have to learn C++ which is mostly used in AAA studios (from my understanding). Just some background, I learned Javascript in highschool for a few years but I never did anything with it and it\u2019s been like 4 years since then, ended up forgetting everything, but as I\u2019m picking up programming again it doesn\u2019t feel foreign to me.

I wanna make commercial games someday with C as the main language due to its surprising simple syntax, great performance, and also because it's statically typed. However, I understand doing everything engineless, even with libraries like Raylib or SDL, is going to be difficult. I considered doing something that (from what I understand) many developers do, and it's using multiple languages in one single project, combining the best of both interpreted and compiled languages.\n\nIs there any guides or tutorials that I could try and use to learn more about game development with C, and what tools I could use in addition to C to make my development easier?\n\nFor some more clarification: I'm leaning more towards 2D games, with some complex features such as Steam integration, online multiplayer, particles, shading, stylized-animated UIs, (maybe even console support?) and such. I'm willing to suffer and learn difficult topics if it means I'll become a better programmer and make good games.\n\nAs a reference: I recently made an RPG with Raylib and C++ (although 99% of it was essentially C code); took me a month and a half to make. It has a map editor, a small input system, a scene manager that uses function pointers to call constructors, uses several files, implemented Items, etcetera. Hopefully this should serve as a rough idea of my skill level: not high, but definitely not zero.",

[Personally, I like this video about portfolios](https://youtu.be/X_tUOfHpoyM?si=Nqxud2K3W6Tk-qUh)--it's about creating a graphic design portfolio but every bit of it still applies to the video game industry. Remember that AAA games are made by a team broken down into specialist groups and those specialists are the people who you are competing with. A smaller studio will appreciate someone who can wear many hats and be a level designer and something else but AAA studios are looking to fill specific niches in their production pipeline. \n\nI knew many folks who went to universities for game development. These programs were well rounded so the students got to know a little of everything and could decide which role they wanted to pursue -- level design, programmer, art, etc -- and __only __ who got hired by AAA studio after graduation was someone who went ALL IN on textures. (That isn't to say the rest didn't get jobs, they did, but only one got a job at a AAA studio. )\n\nIf you apply to be a level designer at Blizzard and you want to show case both game design and level design then you better be damn good at both because it's more than likely that you're competing with someone who  has spent all their time specializing in level design and only that.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you but only highlight the realities of such a lofty goal with no industry experience or connections.",

I've done some map making and scripting but no actual coding, except for copy/pasting trial and error not really understanding the fundamentals.\n\nI want to make a Graphical MUD, something kind of like [Ember Online - aka the old Realms of Kaos](https://emberonline.itch.io/ember-online) and I know it will be a minimum 1-2 year project for me even if I just stick to single player.\n\nAll the MUD engines I've found don't have the built-in image presentation/system and I know the hardcore MUD players have a majority anti-graphics lean, so I would need to build over/onto one of them if I went that route. I could use Unity or Unreal, but they feel like overkill in my situation. I've looked at NaniNovel, Yarnspinner, and some other novel game engines, but I'm not sure they are quick-fit solutions for the GMUD style similar to Ember.\n\nAs far as I can tell atm, any route I take is going to be a huge learning curve for me. I guess my question is, should I get serious with something like Godot? I know it's going to be a challenge for me. Trying to learn coding has always broken my brain in the past. But since Godot is free, I can take my time and build up only what I need for the project.\n\nOr does someone have a better recommendation?",

If upgrading your GPU driver breaks the game for you as the developer, then it is going to break it for your players as well. If it does, you want to know about that as early as possible, so you have more time to fix the problem. So keep your drivers up-to-date while you develop your game.

A rogue-like auto racer, the main loop is you get cards that are car parts and build a car that then goes against the opponent in a bo3 race, the 'runs' are tournaments and each has a bo5 boss race at the end and it gets harder and harder. The parts you draw give different stats and you have to build depending on what kind of track it is for that opponent, windy with lots of corners, balanced with corners and straights and high speed with less corners. I hope this explains somewhat what I'm trying to do but I think Balatro is the closest I can think of to help visualise it. (not trying to copy Balatro, just used as a very base concept)",

That said, I was unsure on how I wanted it to look visually, but yeah, it'll most likely end up being pixels/2D in the same vein of Stardew and Balatro. I will give Godot a try!\n\nIf all else fails with Godot, I will try UE as I wouldn't say I don't enjoy programming I just have always struggled with retaining the info for it, was always my biggest downfall when learning it in college :( so will try UE as a last option, as C++ I have somewhat of a grasp on at least. \n\nThank you for taking the time to reply",

Python can import libraries that are implemented in other programming languages, including C++. In fact most commonly used Python libraries are implemented in other programming languages, because Python itself can be rather slow. \n\nBut Python can't import just any library. \"wrappers\" are required in order to glue the library and Python together. There are some tools that can automatically generate a Python wrapper around a DLL library implemented in other programming languages, but those might not always work without some manual modifications, which will probably be too much for a beginner who only knows a bit of Python and nothing about the source language.\n\nBtw: Godot doesn't use Python. Godot uses GDScript, which kind of looks like Python, but not only has it a couple syntactic differences, the technical implementation is a completely different one. For example, you can't import Python libraries in GDScript. If your goal is to make games with Godot, then prior knowledge of Python might certainly be helpful. But if you are starting from zero, then it might be faster to start with GDScript right away.",

What most people don't realize when they start to get into software development is that they are actually learning two skills at the same time: The syntax of a programming language and the skill of thinking like a programmer. The second skill is actually the much harder one. But beginners can't really tell the difference between the two. So they think that when they spent years to get vaguely competent in language A then it will take the same time to learn language B. But that's not the case, because the skill of thinking like a programmer transfers. The more programming languages you know, the easier it gets to learn new languages.\n\nSo bottom line is: It does not matter what language you start out with to learn how to think like a programmer. And after you grew those programmer synapses in your brain, you should know enough about your personal goals and preferences to make an informed decision for yourself about what language to learn next.",

Lots of studios don't have public faces of anyone on the team on their websites (because even small studios get a lot of negative attention, I've gotten death threats before, etc.) or aren't active on social media.\n\nThere are more studios doing work-for-hire and being subcontracted than ones releasing their own big games, and none of them are really big on the social media presence. Even game studios launching their own games may be hiring people years ahead of getting ready to promote any titles, and they'll stay off the airwaves until then. I know I've posted jobs and hired people in early days of companies where you'd only find a couple names attached to that studio name if you happened to be within three degrees of one of the founders on LinkedIn. \n\nEvery job application expects you to share your resume and portfolio, but those will be able to found online already so it's not terribly private. You wouldn't fill out a test for anyone before you were contacted by an individual over email (and you can then look them up before spending more than a few minutes on the application) but sending over the latest version of your materials and spending five minutes on a cover letter isn't something that requires the hiring manager to also have a community manager and social media marketing person.",
