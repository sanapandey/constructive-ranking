            "body": "Anybody have any issues with shipping from House of Staunton? When I placed my order, the shipping calculation said $15, and when I got my email confirmation, the shipping cost went through as $56. I'm sure that I saw the original place order price, and when I remade the order today I still got the same $15 shipping price for the order.\n\nI talked to support and they said there was nothing they could do because it was already packed out to be shipped, and I don't want to return the order either because they have a 25% restocking fee. \n\nI'm honestly pretty bummed and disappointed and just wanted to know if anyone else had this issue. Anyways, I guess I'll be ordering from chess house moving forward",

It seems like not many other people have had this shipping glitch or whatever it was.\n\nFWIW, I contacted Julian who sends marketing emails for HoS and he got everything sorted out for me by refunding the price difference in shipping. So overall positive experience after he worked things out with me",
