I mean obviously it can mean that, though it feels very olden day Chinese, but in modern day everyday Chinese, I don't come across \u540e to mean queen.  It's often \u738b\u540e or \u7687\u540e.\n\n>And bishop is just \u8c61. It's only \u76f8 for the red side in Chinese chess.\n\nYea, I was basically doing a translation from using pieces from Chinese chess.  Which is kind of what they did here as well, because \u8c61 actually means elephant in normal situations.  But I guess in specialised situations like chess, they use it to mean bishop.  By right, bishop in Chinese is \u4e3b\u6559.",
