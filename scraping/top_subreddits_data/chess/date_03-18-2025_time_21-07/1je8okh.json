If we want to match the Soviet influence, we can't be letting such high level talent work for the competitors.",

Italy is a 70 million people country including newborns and very old people (in fact it's an elder county there's very few youngsters compared to the grown ups). Italy would need a chess prodigy to be born, coached well, win the WC, be as good as vishy at promoting the game and then the luck that the population is enough to produce 4/5 other top talents. It's not a 10 year journey I'm afraid it's more like a 30/50 years journey that involves some luck on top.",

Don\u2019t you find it interesting that Arjun and Gukesh, even though they are Indian, were never his students? Even in passing? \nAlso, the Italians will pay him a backload of money, as did the Romanians before them. Did you hear about any success from the Romanians or the Indian ladies under his guidance? No, because he was there just for the paycheck and didn\u2019t believe in the project. Don\u2019t worry, he will be captain of the US team next, paid by Rex.",

It's not like women players don't want to be coached by him, he's a long time coach of GM Vaishali, WGM Rakshita Ravi and worked with IM Divya in her formative years. He's also coaching Charvi who's the most promising young female talent in India currently.\n\n\nOther top players not wanting to share their preparation with him is a fair concern but it's not like he's a pariah. He's the most sought after coach in the world having worked with players like Pragg, Aravindh and numerous other GMs in their formative years, no other coach currently has a resume like him.\nMaybe he's been offered better pay with the Italian team so he's moving there but he's the biggest reason after Anand behind India's chess boom and has worked tirelessly to reach here, if he wants to make some money now nothing wrong with that. He'll keep working with his mentees in India in individual capacity even as the coach of the Italy team which is what matters.",

Humpy, Harika, Tania, Padmini weren\u2019t. Also he never was their private trainer. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I think Ramesh is a fantastic trainer for a specific type of person. That type being 7 years old and Ramesh approach is the only thing they will ever know. If you meet him later, his ideas and approach are completely alien to you. \n\nOh, he also made an academy with Magnus and another academy with Kasparov. And another with Ganguly, and he just announced another in Chennai. \nIn my opinion, he just goes from paycheck to paycheck, and only cares about the kids that will only have him as a trainer for life. Which is not bad for those kids.",
