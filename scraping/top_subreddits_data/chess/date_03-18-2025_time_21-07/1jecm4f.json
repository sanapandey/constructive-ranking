            "body": "Why are all news sites conflicting between two different issues of women's titles and women's tournaments? Judit Polgar called for abolishing women's titles which Vaishali agreed with while FIDE CEO is talking about women's tournaments.\n\n\nWhen the WGM title was introduced by FIDE in 1976 there were no female GM and very few female IMs. GM title at that time might have seemed out of reach for women so FIDE felt the need to introduce a separate title for women. Now there are 42 female GMs and close to 150 female IMs which might not be a lot compared to male players but it's still big progress. Do these titles hold the same value now especially when there are already open equivalents of WGM and WIM titles in FM and CM respectively? You're basically saying that FM and CM titles aren't good enough on their own so you need to give women a separate title for them to stand out. Women who're IM and GM stand out on their own, they don't need a separate title for that.\n\n\nWomen's tournaments are a necessity currently because there's no active woman in the top-100 but the current structure with gendered competitions at Youth level and young girls not getting to face the strongest competition in their formative years will ensure that there'll be no major change and we'll be back to having the same conversation in 30-40 years.\n\nMake changes at Youth level, hold Open and girls competitions at different times so young girls aren't forced to choose one over the other or better combine both the sections and hand separate prizes for girls if you want. You can't expect there to be change at the top when you're following the same structure at grassroot.",

And within that,\n\n* Level 1 Expert = 2000+ rating; replaces WCM\n* Level 2 Expert = 2100+ rating; replaces WFM\n* Level 3 Expert = 2200+ rating; replaces CM and WIM\n* Level 4 Master = 2300+ rating; replaces FM and WGM\n* Level 5 Master = 2400+ rating and norms; replaces IM\n* Level 6 Grandmaster = 2500+ rating and norms; replaces GM\n\nIf you want you can add levels 7, 8, and 9 of Grandmaster. Let people continue to style themselves with the old title format if they want to; the old ones are considered equivalent names. Pretty simple.",

Just add a few more titles (one above GM, a couple below CM) and eliminate gender in titles.  That way everyone has something to work for that's accessible.\n\nYou can still have women's tournaments and recognition for women while using a unified set of gender-neutral titles.",

What we have/you want even more of is the international governing body handing out titles left right and center. As if FIFA would award an international title to the winner of a 4th tier league in some country.\n\nWe have national federations, some of  which even have their own titles and tier systems. Why would FIDE need to award a title because some person (who will often never play any international tournament) reached an arbitrary threshold once? And what does that achieve apart from one more participation trophy and people asking for yet another title 100/200 points below that new one? Apart from people being mocked, of course - after all you must apply for those titles and pay a fee, any current \"AFM\" or so is a target for jokes...\n\n>Is the answer really simply \"well a misinformed person may not be adequately impressed with my higher title?\" Who cares?\n\nI don't care much, but if you don't: why do titles matter at all, all serious players know who's good anyways ;-)",

I don't have a problem with national chess federations handing out titles for players (that would be pretty much the same as the USCF tier system, just permanent, I guess!?)\n\nIt's just (IMO) idiotic that an organisation that not long ago required a 2200 rating to be in the published list in the first place is now supposed to hand out actual, international titles for everyone who reaches 2000 (with more than 100 points inflation since the 1990s, at that). It is also nothing but a cash grab (exploiting people who want to feel important, I guess), otherwise you would not have to not only apply, but also pay for all the rating based titles including FM.\n\nYou can like it, I can find it idiotic, so lets agree to disagree.\n\nI need to go to bed anyways, much too late - basically killing time on reddit because I have trouble adjusting to the time zone day one of the trip...",
