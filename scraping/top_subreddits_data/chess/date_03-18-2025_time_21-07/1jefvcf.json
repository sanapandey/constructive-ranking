    "selftext": "Hans Niemann on X:\n\nREAD EVERYTHING FOR AN INFORMED OPINION:\nMany chess fans have only a surface-level understanding of my chess career and my relationship with the so-called \u201cchess mafia.\u201d Given the recent events involving the Saint Louis Chess Club (STLCC) and other tournament organizers, I feel it is necessary to provide context.\n\nIn September 2022, I won a chess game. In response, the entire chess world came crashing down on me in an all-out defamation blitz, coinciding with the largest merger in chess history. Someone\u2019s ego was hurt, and they decided to use the full force of a billion-dollar company and its minions to ruin the life of a 19-year-old. STLCC was the organizer of the Sinquefield Cup, and one would expect them to be outraged that Magnus Carlsen disrupted their tournament. One would also assume they would support the American player who had just defeated the world champion. Instead of standing by me when I needed it most, they cut off all communication. I later played in the U.S. Championship and the Fall Chess Classic, but it\u2019s important to note that those contracts had been signed before the Sinquefield Cup.\n\nI initially hoped that America\u2019s premier chess club and de facto federation would support me through this difficult period. I inquired about participating in the 2023 American Cup, Spring Chess Classic, and Summer Chess Classic. However, STLCC suddenly stopped acknowledging my existence. My emails, calls, and texts went unanswered. It was then that I realized I had been wrongfully banned from Chesscom, shadow-banned from nearly all American tournaments, and deprived of countless other invitations. As I reached out to organizers, I slowly came to the harsh realization that the chess powers that be had decided to strip away my opportunities to play the game to which I had dedicated my life.\n\nThis continued until I finally managed to get a phone call with Joy Bray and Tony Rich. I was reassured that I was not blacklisted and that my unanswered emails were simply an oversight. However, considering that I played in the Spring and Fall Chess Classics in 2022 but was not invited to any classics in 2023\u2014despite maintaining a 2700 rating\u2014it became clear that STLCC had consciously chosen to exclude me. Eventually, I was given the chance to return for the U.S. Championship.\n\nUnfortunately, after losing two difficult games, I regretfully damaged my hotel room. Upon leaving, I provided my card, apologized for the damage, and offered to cover the costs. A few days later, I was informed that I had been fined $5,000 and banned from the hotel. Fast forward to January 2024\u2014I reached out to STLCC regarding their upcoming tournaments, only to be ignored once again. Finally, I warned them that if they continued to ignore me, I would make a public statement. In response, they blindsided me by issuing a full ban from all invitational events in 2024.\n\nI fail to see how damaging items in my hotel room has any bearing on my ability to play chess. Conveniently, they announced this ban just before I was about to go public with my concerns, completely sidestepping their unofficial shadow ban in 2023. Even if one accepts their reasoning for the 2024 ban, they have absolutely no justification for their actions throughout 2023. I reached out to the hotel to apologize again and to find a way to be reinstated as a guest. The head of guest relations informed me that there was a 99% chance I would be allowed back and that I would receive written confirmation the next day. However, as expected, he likely consulted STLCC, which then intervened to prevent my reinstatement\u2014ensuring they still had an excuse to blacklist me.\n\nIf STLCC were truly interested in reconciliation, they would have allowed the hotel to lift the ban, allowing everyone to move forward. When journalists contacted the hotel for comment, they were redirected to STLCC. Why is STLCC influencing the hotel\u2019s decision?\n\nTheir true motives have become blatantly clear. I was deeply disappointed by the 2024 ban, but I came to the realization that I had given them the excuse they had been waiting for.\n\nDespite the lack of opportunities, I continued competing, created my own tournaments, and raised my rating to a peak of 2734, further establishing myself as one of America\u2019s most promising young talents. I had hoped that, after my success, 2025 would be different. At the 2024 U.S. Championship, I made significant efforts to mediate the situation with STLCC, even offering further apologies at their request. However, as the New Year arrived and I inquired about the American Cup, my attempts at communication were once again ignored.\n\nAs the #6 ranked player in the U.S., I expected to be invited to the American Cup. I also hoped that my recent success and efforts at reconciliation would help resolve the situation. Instead, STLCC invited two players rated 50 points lower than me and one player 140 points lower. Facing significant public backlash, they attempted to rectify the situation by inviting me to the Spring Chess Classic.\n\nAlthough I was disappointed about the American Cup snub, I was relieved to receive an email invitation. I replied with reasonable questions regarding the tournament\u2019s field, given that past events had an average rating of around 2600. I also inquired about participating in the American Cup Blitz\u2014a tournament that allows 100 players. Preventing me from participating would mean that I had been shadow-banned from tournaments for the third consecutive year, something that could carry serious legal consequences. One would assume STLCC would respond professionally, yet they ignored all further emails about the Spring Chess Classic and have not clarified whether my invitation still stands.\n\nThis marks the third tournament invitation revoked without cause in the last six months. Gashimov, the Chennai GM tournament, and the Spring Chess Classic all invited me, only to later revoke those invitations without explanation\u2014clear violations of FIDE ethics. After legal threats, STLCC claimed that the American Cup Blitz was only open to Missouri-based players. This is a blatant lie; players from across the country have always participated. If even one out-of-state player is admitted, their deception will be exposed.\n\nBefore jumping to conclusions or writing hateful comments, I urge you to consider all the context and history.\n\nNow, why would STLCC do this? Do the executives personally hate me? Is this just Magnus, Hikaru, and Chesscom\u2019s usual underhanded tactics? The answer is simple: STLCC organizes the Grand Chess Tour and has a vested interest in Magnus and Hikaru\u2019s participation. They have leverage over STLCC and have made it clear that they want me exiled from the chess world. The chess mafia instills fear in tournament organizers, either directly or indirectly. Hikaru has even stated publicly that he refuses to compete in the same tournaments as me\u2014an act of pure cowardice that speaks volumes about his true character.\n\nWhile STLCC may believe that ignoring me is the solution, we all remember how ignoring the Alejandro Ram\u00edrez situation turned out.\n\nI will continue to fight for the truth and for the opportunity to let my chess speak for itself.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, thank you for your patience.\n\nOn Dubov Situation:\n\nMy rejection of Dubov\u2019s polygraph conditions was regarding his demand to do it in Dubai and for me to cover the costs. One should not forget that he left without a handshake and called the match a clown show on his way out. It must be done in a neutral setting, I am exploring fair options.",

Chess players have done significantly worse to other players/staff and have gotten off with less.\n\nI understand the aspect of USCF or SLCC getting scared of lawyers being brought in, but besides that, it seems like they are completley in the wrong in this foray. There is no basis for them to do what they're doing, and it sets a very dangerous precedent if decisions like Hikaru saying he won't play in the same tournament as Hans are leading to Hans being blacklisted from tournaments.",

I'm sure his *ability to play chess* is fine.  But damaging items in your hotel room damages the reputation of the tournament organizers.  It damages their ability to book hotels in the future.  It (literally) damages the hotel.  It takes up a bunch of time and effort from other people to deal with.  He may have paid a fine to the hotel, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility.  Instead of making a personal reflection on it he got combative with the tournament organizers who understandably might not want to invite him back, threatened to try and give them negative press, and also made a bunch of references to possible lawsuits.  \n\nI would have a lot more sympathy if he showed more regret.  I really want to like Hans as a strong chess player with a lot of personality.  Players like Hikaru or Shankland have had some negative outbursts that I disagree with but ultimately can look past and like them as players, but Hans feels a good cut beneath even them in his overall maturity or decency.  I think there are ways for him to demonstrate growth and work his way back in to the chess community, but he doesn't seem willing to do that work.  It sounds like he even got another tournament invitation from them but instead of graciously accepting started criticizing them that it wasn't the invitation he wanted, or threatened to sue.  His best move would probably have been to kindly accept it and play the tournament without incident, showing that inviting him isn't a risk and paving the way for more invitations in the future.",

He's still quite antagonistic on his socials towards other players and TOs. He's been on this crusade for how long now? Is it working? Is he getting more invites? Sounds like it's time to try something else. I think he's essentially right on almost all his points and it's not fair. But life isn't fair. Sometimes you just gotta suck it up. He's still perceived as the fireball of chess. People don't want to deal with that. He needs to try just playing it cool even if it's not fair. Over time people's perception will change",
