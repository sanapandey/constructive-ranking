But there isn't. \n\nHowever, I think a lot of arguments and discussions around this matter break down into this confusing hodgepodge which then inevitably end up in a shouting match where Americans end up having to justify their founding ethos or whatever you wanna call it. \n\nPersonally, I couldn't care less who represents the American flag. But surely it's tone deaf for Americans to not realize that people will see Levon or Leinier representing the US in the Olympiad in the same way others see Qatari athletes? A part of me does find it a bit sad that this takes away 2 spots from American chess players who were born in America, and played their chess in America. But a part of me is like, \"so what? Who gives a shit? It is what it is.\" No one is complaining about high skilled professionals from other countries working in American academia and research (I think), saying they're taking spots from \"real\" Americans.

                                    "body": "If I am understanding you correct, the main point is that we can tie this notion of 'American' to ethnic groups who have been here the longest because of mixing/genetic changes over time. I don't tie the label 'American' to those groups who have been here the longest because I don't believe that will have that much of an effect; think of the 2nd gen. immigrant Asian kids who, despite not being *as mixed* as African-Americans, still consider the US their primary country/don't really associate with the home country of their parents. \n\nAnyhow, my point was more broadly about technology rather than the groups of people. If you use a GPS (seems like this contributed to 'building america'!), I can very easily argue you are using an 'Ashkenazi' technology because Einstein's work makes it such that GPS' function. It's very easy to boil down inventions to one group but very hard to prove that generalization is true, which is a problem for people who argue 'ethnic europeans built modern america'",
