After you pay your seconds, you might realize that it's not very good pay for a fairly intense set of matches + engaging in this kind of media circus.\n\nIn effect, Hans basically paid them for some rated training games.\n\nSo many of the gms accepting this would be those on the downswing in terms of their rating with few other options.\n\nNot to mention that depending on how much you trust him, going into a venue set up by an opponent that has a reputation for cheating might be enough to psych you out. All the thoughts enter your head. What if he cheats just enough to equalize? It's a nice way to squeeze a few rating points while minimizing monetary losses.\n\nIt's almost certanly not what's going on. But what if?

If the lie detector test said he lied about cheating OTB, we'd never hear the end of it - even though it is pseudoscience. And those same people probably would not be satisfied with a \"true\" result. It's a lose-lose, but that means he shouldn't have agreed to it in the first place, it does look bad to back out.",

Knowing whether something is a lie is the ultimate purpose of a lie detector and we can mathematically prove that simply doing the test twice does not give you a more accurate result. It might as well make the result less accurate. Its the same reason that doing the test once but with twice as many data points that *could* be markers for lying will also not give you a more accurate result. Unless you can prove that these new markers are better than the ones you had before. In which case the best result would have been gained by discarding the less accurate data.\n\n\n>That information is then taken and \"graded\" by the polygrapher.\n\nIt is just a math problem. It doesn't get better by using fanzy words. You have dozens of markers saying all sorts of things and then you make a determination based on the sum of those results. Now it is entirely possible that the polygrapher is not doing actual math and is instead just guestimating something based on what he sees, but math is still math even though you not doing equations and are just making a wild guess.\n\n\n\n>Fwiw, if I were asked to take a polygraph regarding a crime I hadn't committed, I would decline.\n\nGood for you.

See the normal thing you do in a interview is that you look at some entirelly different datapoints that aren't you to try to assess whether or not what you said is truthfull. Maybe you ask for references. Maybe they ask for documentation. If they are the goverment they already have some data about citizens that they for various reasons would consider less thrustworthy, like a criminal record. Those are data points that you can assume are clearly more independent than non independent and thus taking those into consideration gives them more confidence in the information they have about you. \n\n\n>Polygraphs are essentially this process, but with the added information of your biological response to the questions. They aren't perfect. They aren't giving binary yes or no answers.\n\nThey are giving you answers to *something*. It doesn't have to be lying or truth. It doesn't have to be binary. But but they are trying to answer a question based on the biological data and that incurs exactly the same problems as you would have gotten if you tried to use it as a lie detector. It isn't and can't be reliable.\n\n\nAnd yes. Looking at a bunch of data that can and often is presented numerically and making a determination based on that is math. You are comparing datapoints from when you answer a question to how you answered them when doing these baseline questions of yours. That's math. The fact that polygraphers aren't resolving the math in a standardized and reproducable manner is only more evidence of its unreliability.",

It was Dubov's terms which Hans agreed to. He is going back on his word, which is already under heavy scrutiny. He said he mainly didn't do it because Dubov disrespected him, which in most peoples view is a cop out.\n\nIt will definitely negatively effect any potential future chess events. If you dont think his image will be hurt bad then take a look at this thread and his own comments section of his video. (chess people are fickle but I don't think I have ever seen such a unanimous distain of a Hans, even at the height of the Magnus accusations). Even his supports are taking the piss out of him with this choice. With the cheating allegations he could deny and it was his word against others, with this we can see what his word is worth. I was in 2 camps before the video, but now its impossible to defend his action.",
