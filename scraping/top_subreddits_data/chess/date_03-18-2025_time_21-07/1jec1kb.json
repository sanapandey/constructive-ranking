I doubt Kramnik really believes that Hikaru cheats because his YouTube videos have an eval bar or that Naroditsky cheats because he doesn\u2019t stream every part of his room during TT. He also played Jospem twice irl and never apologized or retracted his accusations despite Jospem performing as expected, and he regularly accuses anyone lower rated who beats him on chesscom of cheating.\n\nKramnik doesn\u2019t like people associated with chesscom and tries to ruin their reputation using false cheating accusations. This is also why he likes Hans, who is the poster boy of conflict with chesscom.",

He just doesn't take direct digs or throw cheating accusations against him cos at that point even a toddler will think you are insane. Also, he leverages Magnus as a tool in his cheating accusations. Cos you need to have some human reference or standard to compare your analysis.",

He always plays very principled chess, but the biggest difference between him and me is that he makes a lot more mistakes. Often he seems to think he\u2019s in the right, but I\u2019m actually right.\n\nHe\u2019s very confident. He\u2019s not afraid of anyone. He doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m better than him. He doesn\u2019t think Aronian\u2019s better than him and he doesn\u2019t think Anand is better than him. He actually loses games to Nakamura, but he certainly doesn\u2019t believe Nakamura is better than him.\"\n\nSo a part of Kramnik probably wants to prove the world that he is smarter that the rest and understands Niemann better.",
