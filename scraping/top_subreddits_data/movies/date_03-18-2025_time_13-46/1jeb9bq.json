People accuse him of projection but the reality seems to be that he is just fed up with being the least liked person in the circles he wished to be accepted in.",

You never wanted my friendship. And you feared to be in my debt.\n\n\"I thought you were literally Hitler.\"\n\n\"I understand. You found paradise in Hollywood. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The politicians protected you and there was a lot of money coming in at the box office while you cut the pay of everyone who worked for you. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say \"Donald Trump, give me justice.\" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me \"MAGA King.\" You come into my house on the I am to release the JFK files and you ask me to ban AI technology - for money.\"\n\n\"I ask you for artistic justice.\"\n\n\"That is not justice. Your bad movies are not banned.\"\n\n\"Let their labor be taxed, then, as I have been taxed. How much shall I pay you?\"\n\n\"Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, this AI scum who are ruining your industry would be taxed into oblivion this very day. And if by some chance a Hollywood big-shot like yourself made enemies in Silicon Valley, they would become MY enemies in Silicon Valley. And then, they would fear you.\"",
