    "selftext": "recently got hands on and watched the new Criterion 4K disc and Wow.  every time i revisit this movie i'm reminded of how much i love every minute of it.  Michael Mann's first movie and he crushes it.  i know some people may get bored of the long heist sequences but i'm riveted.   James Caan is peak James Caan, supporting characters are great, particularly the smarmy cops.  however, i  think the real star of this film is Tangerine Dream.  their original score is beyond fantastic.  it truly elevates every scene in a way that all other scores should aspire to.\n\nif you love Heat but have never seen Thief, do yourself a favor and fix that.  a lot of the themes are the same in that 'don't get attached to anything...' philosophy kind of way.  Neo Noir at it's finest",
