It has nothing to do with the creative or anything else. There\u2019s higher-level things at play. Saw XI may or may not be made, but we have a very timely story in it, and I hope it gets made just because of that. It taps into the same themes of Saw VI, where you\u2019re a citizen, you feel angry and frustrated with something, you feel like you can\u2019t do anything, and John Kramer\u2019s going to do it. The reason it\u2019s held up is just, there\u2019s inter-squabbling between producers and Lionsgate. They just can\u2019t quite get on the same page.\u201d\n\n>Melton points out that Saw X did well, and that the team has a concept that they\u2019re proud of for the next movie. They intended to tackle a timely topic, although plot details have not yet been shared publicly. The writer likens the new project\u2019s premise to the timeliness of 2009 release Saw VI, in which health insurance executives are targeted by John Kramer, aka Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). This topic captured renewed attention earlier this year with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\n>As it turns out, Melton actually went to college with slain United Healthcare CEO Thompson at the University of Iowa. \u201cWe were at Iowa at the same time, so we graduated the same year in 1997,\u201d recalls the writer, who notes that they knew each other but weren\u2019t close friends. \u201cI can tell you Brian was pretty normal at school.

That entire concept was so weird and just dumb to me. Reminded me of Singer's Superman Returns. \n\n  \nThe problem with going that route is where do you go from there? You've already done a reboot in Jigsaw, a spinoff with Spiral and now a Prequel with Saw X. So where exactly do you go now? Do you keep up the prequel concept with a follow up to Saw X which takes place between Saw 2 and 3 already? Do you make a sequel to Spiral which many didn't care for already? They've all but abandoned the concepts behind Jigsaw. \n\n  \nAt least with the original series there was a soft narrative they could follow, but it really feels like they tapped the well on the Kramer front and honestly, I thought Spiral was the perfect concept for a follow up. Sadly the movie wasn't all that great and forced them to basically reboot again.",
