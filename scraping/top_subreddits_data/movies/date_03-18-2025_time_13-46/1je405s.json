About eight comments at the moment but maybe more people will show up\n\nThis movie's a little different from Borat because Zack actually ran for city council in real life while we were making the movie. So it blurs the line between what's real and fake. Like when we have Colbert speaking about him it actually happened on his program (you can skip to 9:00 - [https://youtu.be/UMGwFunSl1Q?si=foncAEi-L7LBvszu&t=540](https://youtu.be/UMGwFunSl1Q?si=foncAEi-L7LBvszu&t=540) )\n\nHaving said that, I get not wanting to even touch politics with the news that's around us",

They felt like politics has become so insane and fake and wondered if there's anything left there. So the movie is less about \"look how whacky politics is!\" and more about \"Ok, yes it's crazy, but what can we do with that?\" And the answer at the end of the film seems to be to focus on local politics and our communities. In the film, Zack (the candidate) is so focused on getting national attention, but in the end realizes the best approach is to focus on his pocket of the world. Something that I know sounds corny might resonate more now that national politics are crazy once again - Daniel",
