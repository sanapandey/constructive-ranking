But I\u2019ll be happy see Urban chew some scenery and Sanada kicking ass is always a delight to see on screen\n\nFirst movie was a fun watch but I hope this sequel puts that main character off to the side.  Cole Young was just a poorly made protagonist (and I want to see the actual MK tournament, dammit)",

Hell, I think up until TLoU it was the closest we had to the game incarnate. Others like Silent Hill and Resident Evil (the first ones) had some great moments and atmosphere but changed the stories way too much. \n\nThe soundtrack alone is probably the best part, the opening theme over the credits is still incredible 30 years later!",

It would get narratively boring. And then a lot of the characters are probably a little too unique or have too complex of a backstory to be the face of a fighting games series where significant amount of players are only going to lightly engage with the story.\n\nIn this context Johnny Cage, and later Cassie, work really well. They have pretty straightforward, easy-to-understand backstories. You can explain Johnny in one sentence as \"Arrogant but fun action star now fighting in a death tournament.\" And going from flippant to dedicated hero is a natural arc.",

Unless you were a \"high level necromancer\" or a servant of the elder god of death, you could at best only summon their souls and use them for energy. Similar to Shang Tsung in the MK9 timeline.\n\nWhen Quan Chi came into the picture, he was basically a \"priest\" of Shinook. Which upped his necromancy powers to the point where he could actually create Vengeful specters (MK9 timeline) on his own. But it wasn't until he was personally blessed/empowered by Shinook in... mk10? that he could create Revenants. (basically resurrected, corrupted versions of the original living creature)\n\nShinook ironically enough considers the Necromancy part of his status as an elder god beneath him. And entrusts those abilities to his followers. However he loves his bone constructs.\n\nIt wasn't until MK10 and past that, that death became basically meaningless. But that was mainly due to Quan Chi becoming empowered by Shinook. Otherwise at best Shang Tsung could use your soul for energy/his powerset/experiments.\n\nQuan Chi himself wouldn't bother trying to make you into a Vengeful specter/revenant unless you proved to be extremely powerful in life.\n\nThis was only in earth though. Its not exactly understood the power necromancers have in Outworld and the Netherrealm. As its never explicitly told to us. Although a lot of comics have implied that Quan Chi is more or less second to god in the Netherrealm, although he can be killed like anyone else in the Nether realm. I think in Chaos realm, Necromancy doesn't work since nothing dies, and in Order realm, you'd be 20 kinds of dead before you even completed resurrecting a mouse. But alternatively, in Order realm, Necromancy is implied to outright not work, unless attempted by extremely powerful beings.\n\nContinuity is weird.",

With all the pressure, Shang Tsung decides to skirt the rules and attack potential contenders. \n\nMovie would play out the same more or less. Except Goro does not die, he is the **reigning fucking Champion**. Have Shao Kahn get wind of Shang Tsungs plot and send Goro in to shut that shit down. Kahn won't risk pissing off the Elder Gods and fucking up his 10th victory. \n\nThe heroes are weary but feeling pretty high off the win against Shang, until he reveals that aside from Sub-Zero; none of the kombatants would have competed in the Tournament and were mostly assassins and brutes and not warriors. \n\nGoro comes through in a portal to collect Shang; Cole attacks feeling especially smug after beating Sub-Zero and thinking Shang is full of shit, feeling he can end it all now. Cole gets absolutely *bodied* by Goro and ripped in half. Heroes see how out of their depth they are in regards to the Tournament, they need to recruit and train, also opens up the floor for Liu Kang to step into his role as the lead.",

Some of the fights and sequences were cool (and Lawson as Kano was great as you mentioned) but also there was so much bleh with Cole being a big part of that especially when he got his power and it was literally plot armor...I just can't (not to mention the waste of Goro which honestly made me angrier than even Cole's power). The gore was pretty insane but it reminded me of AvP: Requiem where the filmmakers were like \"we aren't going to be afraid of making this a violent hard R!\" but forgot that gore is not a substitute for a good story.\n\nI do hope 2 is better. I am sort of mixed on Urban: on one hand happy since he is always great and it seems like they might side line Cole some but on the other, I am not sure he is Johnny Cage (both with his accent and his is a bit on the older side).",

This helmet probably also looks a lot better on faraway shots since the actor is huge and jacked.",

That character did not belong in the movie.\n\nGiven the extensive roster of the games, there was zero reason for there to be someone's fanfiction OC self insert involved. Especially them being in the middle of the biggest franchise rivalry fight in the movie.\n\nJosh Lawson's Kano is also confirmed as returning, which isn't a surprise considering how his \"death\" set him up for a more game accurate look in this one.\n\nI am wondering if they're going to cover the first tournament or the second in Outworld in this movie. (If they do either at all.)\n\nThe first film seemed to kind of set up the tournament from MK1.\n\nEveryone we know of so far can kind of fit in there given the way they slotted in characters in the first movie.",

It wasn't awful, but it wasn't very good either. \n\nIt had a fine cast, for the most part, visually it looked good and faithful to the games. It had everything going for it and... It was actually kinda boring.\n\nI don't know. Maybe it was the focus on Cole, a brand new character made exclusively, or maybe because for sole reason they've decided to film two of their action set pieces one in a parking lot and the other in the freaking yard of a house in the suburbs?\n\nI don't know. Those two fight scenes with Scorpio did look cool, but it seems they knew that's all the movie had going for it, so it's no wonder they've released those scenes prior the movie release.\n\nI'll be cautious about this one this time around.",
