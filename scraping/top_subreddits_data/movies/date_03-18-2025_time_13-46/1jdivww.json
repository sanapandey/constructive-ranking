The [Norwegian](https://youtu.be/_MZqNliEHns?si=n8X-lnCWG1i7x94o) [trailers](https://youtu.be/lPRW203y3xY?si=66YkvPr78tuPwKxd) are less spoilery, and save a few major surprises that this trailer by Shudder shows, and also give a better sense of the tone of the movie.\n\nI would say to keep your expectations in check for the movie, because it isn't as outlandish as people claimed it was, but when they do go for the few body horror scenes they are, they deliver. This was my most anticipated movie of the year, and I was mostly satisfied, although the ending and conclusion could've used a little more work, especially in regards to the utter misery, torment, and mutilation Elvira goes through at the behest of her hellbent mother. The cast is phenomenal, by the way.",

Describing it kinda undersells how rough it is. It'll make you squirm.",

Elvira unsuccessfully tries fitting the right slipper on her foot, and realizes that it'll fit without her toes. She then places her right foot on a stool, takes a piece of firewood, and smacks that right on the cleaver twice to cut off her toes. Rebekka and little sister Alma then arrive, and Elvira passes out when Rebekka says it's the wrong foot. Rebekka then chops off the toes on Elvira's left foot!<.\n\nThe ending and resolution after all this misery, however, is one of my few issues with the movie, as it feels a bit weak and undercooked after the what has unfolded.\n\n>!After waking up from a nightmare that Agnes ended up with the prince, as she fits the slipper, Elvira crawls her way down and out the house, falling down two staircases, before her little sister Alma comes to the rescue to help her. The movie ends with Alma wheelbarrowing her big sister down the stairs outside the house, and helping her up on a horse as they ride away to the prince!<.",

The part where the prince comes to see if the shoe fits is shown in a dreamlike way, but (going off memory) I feel like we also at least hear some of it happening for real while she is crawling and falling down the stairs, and by the time she is outside the prince and Agnes have already left together. Alma and Elvira ride off together, escaping their mother who by now clearly does not care for them, and they ride off to be on their own together, a bittersweet ending, but I didn't interpret it like Elvira still had any chance to be with the prince.!<",

The trailer is basically shoving all the most graphic parts of the movie into one space to make it look like torture porn, which it isn't. The movie is beautiful and a slow burn and haunting, I hope people give it a chance",
