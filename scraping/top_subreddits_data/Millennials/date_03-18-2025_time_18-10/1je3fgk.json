Healthy competition is good for both individuals and groups, as you either rise to the occasion or don't. If you rise to the occasion, then it forces someone else to do the same. \n\nBy making it into group a vs group b, both groups get exposure and (at least when this took place) people would buy both of their CDs to compare to two.",

They had very melodic \u201cpunk\u201d songs, radio worthy with catchy choruses. Ramones did too but that\u2019d be sacrilege to put them in this category. Early Green Day pre-Dookie was very much punk and why a lot of the detractors for the band say they \u201csold out\u201d. But I agree, Dookie was a pop punk album with a tinge of alternative. They were transitioning to that sound and 2000\u2019s on I tuned out. IMO Blink 182 is the sound emulated by an entire wave of pop punk bands that dominated late 90\u2019s to mid 2000\u2019s. Then came the Brand New/TBS/Fallout Boy sound. Paramore falls in that category for me. I actually met Hayley in 2006 at a show in Syracuse where they were the opener. Augustana, Cartel, Gym Class Heroes and headlined by Emery. I think I spent maybe 15$ bucks on tickets, crazy to think of. She was maybe 16 or 17 at the time, you could tell she had \u201cIT\u201d. She watched the rest of the shows in the crowd with all of us. Probably the only \u201ccelebrity\u201d I\u2019ve ever met. Down to earth, cool experience.

Which I used to hate, but here we are.\n\nThere has been some music made since 2020 that I have liked, but the heavy synth and autotune, with the almost-too-clean music production is offputting to me.

But punk rockers don't hire a team of producers that are known for writing pop hits to help them write music. Punk rockers actually pay their dues playing at dive bars and clubs and work their way up which Avril never had to do. \n\nAvril was fast tracked into stardom the same way pop artists are. She was discovered at a bookstore performing cover songs. Demo tapes were sent out of her doing country covers. Someone at a major label liked her sound and they wrote punk pop songs for her to sing and dressed her up like a punk rocker. She had some input in the writing, and she is very talented, I don't want to take that away from her. \n\nBut Hayley Williams was a punk rocker. She wrote punk rock, she performed it in the underground. She wasn't just a voice that was snatched and \"assigned\" to punk rock through a label. She actually wrote all of her music and made it to the top the hard way. I have 100X more respect for Hayley because of that.",

For those of us that were into the punk scene back then, Avril\u2019s music was kind of a running joke and pretty cringeworthy. \n\nGranted, I was a total music snob and probably unbearable to be around back then \ud83d\ude43 but teenaged-me felt very passionate about that lol.",

She was fast-tracked into fame through industry connections and a major label push\n\nHayley didn't have any help. She wrote all her stuff by herself. She paid her dues in the local music scene playing small clubs and bars. Like she is an actual musician to me while Avril is more of a pop star. Both are fine in their own right. But I have more respect for the struggle that Hayley went through to make it.",

I hated her when she first came out bc I was heavy into the skater punk and ska scene and had worn ties before so you can imagine the comparisons and I viewed her as a total poser (lol) and just hated her on principal. I've still not listened to much of the first album tbh.\n\nUnder My Skin came out when I was moving away from home and had a 500 mile drive with a friend who had to listen it and I was hooked. I still love that album even 2 decades later. The Best Damn Thing still gets playtime too and even my 15 year old son enjoys it. We joke that those two albums actually go together bc the forner is mostly heavier, sadder, or more ballady with a couple fun pop punky ones and the latter is the exact opposite. There's defiantly tracks off albums that followed those that I like but I don't listen to any of them all the way through.\u00a0\n\nI think they probably had different audiences bc of age and sound but both are talented. People saying Avril Lavigne never wrote any of her music and can't sing obviously don't know much about her bc she wrote and cowrote most of her stuff (HW was a cowriter too) and she can belt it out if you listen to any of her number of ballad style songs. I think it's silly to have to try to bring one down when you want to lift the other up. And honestly I don't really like the latest stuff from either of them lol. If I want new angsty girl music I'll just go for Olivia Rodrigo tbh, who isn't necessarily as great of a vocalist as either of them but is a better songwriter than both of them IMO \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Hayley turned down several labels for wanting to make her a pop solo artist, she wanted to be in a rock band! Paramore had several pure rock albums, Avril's Let Go was a pop rock album with mostly pop songs and a 2-3 rock songs.  It's not bad, it's just not as rock as Paramore was.\n\nI also remember at one point during the RIOT era, people were calling Paramore the \"anti-Avril\" band.",

Hayley is far more involved in the writing process of her music. Both in the lyrics and the melodies. When I listen to a Paramore song, it's like I'm listening to Hayley's creation. When I listed to Avril Lavigne it's more like I'm listening to her perform hits that she had help to write. It think Avril has done more writing later in her career, but I just feel like Hayley is much more of an artist than her. \n\nAnd honestly Avril always felt \"Fake punk\" to me early in her career. Like she dressed the part and acted the part. But is it hard for me to consider you to be punk rock when you hire The Matrix, producers that are known for crafting pop hits. Plus Hayley Williams paid her dues on the local scenes playing small clubs and VFW halls. Avril Lavigne's career started with a big label push so she never really had to pay any of those dues to make it in the music industry. \n\nSo to me, it really isn't close. Hayley is fare more punk rock and far more of a respected musician than Avril. But that doesn't mean I don't respect Avril. I just respect people that came up through music the way that Hayley did a lot more.",
