I mixed those up with the socks I used for my flats on the first day of training, so I was walking around looking ridiculous. I noticed during class, and asked my friend/coworker how she could let me walk around like that (as a joke obviously not her fault) and she said she thought I was trying a new fashion trend. I had to excuse myself to the restroom and keep my socks in my bag the rest of the day.",
