    "selftext": "I wasn't really listening to Linkin Park; I was watching 106 and Park. Remember \"We Ready\" by Archie? \"24s\" by TI? Bone Crusher? The way the bass hit in that song \"Damn\" from Lil John and the Eastside Boys? They callin me...\n\nMy father made me listen to Eric B and Rakim, Public Enemy, and LL Cool J because it was \"real hip hop.\" Nas, the Wu, etc. was also acceptable. I mostly hated Nelly, Snap Rap, Jeezy, T-Pain, Lil Wayne etc., at the time, but now there's a nostalgia that I can't shake when I listen to that shit (even though a lot of it was objectively garbage).\n\nErykah Badu (remember Baduizm?), Jill Scott, Angie Stone (RIP), Musiq Soulchild, Floetry, India Arie, Macy Gray, D'Angelo, Ginuwine, Keith Sweat, Blackstreet, etc. That was music.\n\nI don't consider \"word\" or \"crib\" to be \"outdated\" slang terms. \"Swag\" and \"on fleek\" are definitely outdated, and we know this, but we can't really explain why they are outdated while the other ones aren't. We just know, because it's our culture. Other people don't really get it, so once *they* stop using something it must not be of value anymore. But they still mine the fuck out of our vocabulary and repackage it as \"Gen Z slang\" or some shit.\n\nI had cornrows under colorful du-rags and New Era fitteds and I rocked big cubic zirconias in each ear. Big ass fake \"silver\" and \"platinum\" dollar sign chains, because that was the platinum era. \n\nI wore Iversons, Forces, and Timbs on my feet. Phat Farm, Sean John, Fubu, and Pelle Pelle gave way to tall tees and airbrushed t-shirts. Colorful shit with Looney Tunes characters. Horrible clothes, but it's what we wore. \n\nI spent summers at Granny's house with Big Mike, Uncle Timmy and them eating chicken fried steak and fried green tomatoes. I met about 23 new cousins every summer, and I learned about our roots in Mississippi and Kentucky. \n\nI know Reddit skews White. I know a lot of Millennials shared certain experiences regardless of race. But gotdamn, sometimes I feel like I can't relate to half the stuff that gets posted here!\n\nSincerely, a '91 baby -- solidly Millennial, solidly Black.\n\nEDIT: It seems there are some angry people in here downvoting my comments and blocking me. Thank you for proving that your \"post-racialism\" is really just racism masquerading as utopian enlightenment. ",

Hate it or Love It is still my jam. \n\nThank you for sharing here and reminding us there was a lot more to our generation than just My Chemical Romance!",

Up through middle school I mostly listened to R&B (RIP Aaliyah) but starting in high school I was actually more into like Linkin Park and Incubus and whatnot. I wasn't too into popular hip hop from like 2002 onwards. My school was kinda lame so I didn't know about like, so-called \"backpack rap\" and more underground stuff, which I probably would've liked. Fashion-wise my mom didn't let me wear that stuff lol. I was trying (and failing) to pull off some kind of preppy/punk hybrid.\n\nAs for some of the reactions in this thread, not surprising. Some people see American black people talking about their experiences and assume we're intentionally like...trying to antagonistically divide ourselves from everyone else? And it's like. I KNOW I'm a part of a greater whole. I'm not stupid. But it's disingenuous to act like American black people don't often have specific experiences that we might want to connect over. It doesn't mean I see the world as 'Black People Stuff' and 'Other'. Yes, I too was raised not to see color. And yet, I have still had specific experiences that would not have happened to me if I weren't black. Is there a reason I can't reflect on that?",

            "body": "Born in 85 from a black African father and white canadian mother. Grew up both in Africa and Canada but teens years were in Canada. It was a cultural shock when I arrived, I discovered South Park, Marilyn Manson, Video Games (there was no video games were I was), Star Wars\u2026 It was difficult at the beginning to understand all those different things as they were linked with a lot of subcultures and counterculture which wasn\u2019t that prevalent in the village I use to live in Africa. Took me a couple of years to adjust to it and embrace it.  Around 1999, started to enjoy more of western music, especially punk (the offspring, pennywise, bad religion, nirvana) and hip hop (eminem, dr dre, tupac, biggie), food was also very different: I hated western food for a long time and then got used to to it. Discovered Western Cinema as well, not the film but the infrastructure, the closest cinema we had was a building with no roof so you had to wait past sunset to watch the first film and because it wasn\u2019t covered, you could hear the dialogue from far away. But the major difference was the difference in violence acceptance in society, I come from a very humble family, money wasn\u2019t something that was around much as a kid and even education (smallest class I attended was 98 people in Africa) so violence was a language that often used and when I arrived in Canada I had to learn how to not fight as often in high school. My teens years were, not gonna lie, difficult but since then I am fully acclimatized to the culture here. If you can picture that would have been an encounter between Mean Girls and Trainspotting.",

The reason I ask is because American culture tends to appropriate Black culture and repackage it as \"pop culture\" without respecting its origins. At the same time, White youths often emulate aspects of Black culture as part of a kind of rebellious phase and abandon it once it has served its purpose. I'm not accusing you of anything I just mentioned, but I do believe that part of the reason you say this didn't seem unique to Black or White (i.e., you \"don't see color\") is because you're used to White American culture swallowing up Black American culture.",

I hate when yall do this shit. \n\nYou stated that differentiating Black and White culture is a way for the ruling class to divide us. While there is merit to that statement because the ruling class certainly benefits from any discord between the economically oppressed classes, the problem with your statement is that it minimizes Black American culture, which is indeed a unique culture within the larger American experience. How can it not be a culture even it displays all of the necessary requirements of a culture? It has a unique language, a unique musical tradition, unique food, unique religion, and countless other traits that you would recognize as constituting a unique culture in any other case. \n\nFurthermore, rather than recognizing this post as a form of lighthearted intraracial dialogue (which many Whites find threatening), you see it as an attack against your self-righteous post-racial enlightenment. Thus, you wag your finger at me, the ignorant Black guy who is \"speaking words but isn't saying anything,\" and attempt to educate me in the ways of your misguided sense of class consciousness. Worst of all, your statement that I'm not saying anything is wholly false. I said a lot, but I said it in the language of an experience with which you are not familiar.",
