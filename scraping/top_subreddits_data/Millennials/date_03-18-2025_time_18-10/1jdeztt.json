We had blue screens of death, accidentally downloading viruses from Napster and Kazaa, then having to go and figure out where the virus downloaded to in your computer and having to manually delete all of the affected files until your computer wasn't under attack by advertisements anymore, and de-bugging our MySpace's HTML code when the music player that you added to it made it suddenly not load properly anymore. We also had media literacy education, and, at least in my Social Studies class, they taught us about propaganda, and how to basically always question where a message is coming from, and who profits (either financially or politically) from you (and a lot of other people) buying into a message. \n\nIt seems like basically all of that are relics of the past, and the generations younger than us seem to be suffering because of it.",
