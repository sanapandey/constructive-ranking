    "selftext": "Little by little throughout the last 5 or 6 years I've started to morph into one step above a curmudgeon. I have five close friends and lots of family, and I am married. However the idea of getting out and hanging out with people that I love for an extended period of time is getting more and more daunting and less appealing. \n\nMy wife was out of town last weekend and I had the best Saturday I've had in a very long time. I got up at 7:00, made a hearty breakfast and some coffee and sat on the porch, went back inside and did some house chores for a few hours, took a little nap, had some lunch went in the backyard and did yard work for another few hours, showered, sat on the porch swing and read a book and smoked a cigar, walked to the nearby deli to grab a sandwich, ate it at home while watching a movie, then I was in bed by 10:00 p.m. \n\nI didn't talk to anybody except a few texts with my wife, I thought I didn't respond to any snapchats, only thing I did on my phone was listen to podcasts while doing my work. I feel like at 31 years old I shouldn't be so opposed to hanging out with friends and family, going on going to concerts, or doing anything fun that involves leaving the house.",

That being said there is a balance, and just like I feel drained and get to a tipping point where socializing becomes grating, I also have times where I'm so stuck in my own world that depression or what have you gets to me and I feel an urge to get out and socialize.",

What I do, though, is allow myself to get dragged out to those events. Most of the time, anyway. Most of the time, I do not want to go before getting dragged out. I'd almost always rather be at home. But what we want and what we need are often 2 very different things. Socialization is a need, a need a lot of us don't want, but a need nonetheless. I've done the whole sit at home and do what I want thing for a long period of time, it feels good but it's a slippery slope because the longer you go without real socializing the harder it is to jump back in. It's all about finding a balance because, as antisocial as I am, those kind of events are good for your mental health. As is taking time for yourself. Just gotta strike the balance right. Too much or too little of either thing isn't good for you. That \"daunting\" feeling only grows the more you let it sit. Almost every time I don't want to go to something and still go, it makes me feel better, and it makes getting home after to do the stuff I want feel far more rewarding.",

Old people still want to be able to do stuff, they just can't. My grandfather would have loved to go to Broadway in NY one last time, or to Vegas.\n\nAnyway I don't think isolating yourself is really super healthy at any age but especially not at 31. But obviously you have a wife so as long as things are good with her then you're not really that abnormal.",
