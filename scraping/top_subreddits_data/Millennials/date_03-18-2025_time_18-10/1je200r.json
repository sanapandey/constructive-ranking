Some of my first graders in 2021 told me they had never used play-doh before. One of them couldn't pull apart regular unifix cubes during math. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. Every few years districts spend big money on new curricula, and teachers lose more autonomy in teaching.

I tried so hard to get her interested in Lego, since that is something that I love, but she would lose interest pretty quickly. We have had playdoh and polymer clay, and tried painting. It is actually really annoying, because buying her presents is a real challenge. Reading was initially a challenge, due to a combination of Covid and her school using a stupid method for teaching reading. Once  I found something she had an interest in, she picked it up pretty quickly. She actually reads at a very high proficiency now, like 92 percentile or something like that.",

Those are ages where there are some pretty huge developmental leaps in academic responsibility, social skills, and emotional maturity. Imagine a 6th grader fresh in middle school who hasn't been in a classroom with peers since they were 8 years old, or a senior in high school on the verge of adulthood with the social/emotional skills of a 14-year-old. Those were the kids I had in 2022-23, and those were the most challenging to deal with and the ones who several years on are still pretty far behind where they should be. The kids who missed early elementary or kindergarten caught up a lot quicker. The kids who missed middle school missed their blunder years being public and transitioned to high school pretty smoothly - and they also were a lot more invested in socializing in-person, which I think has actually helped them a lot even over pre-panedmic teens who were more glued to their phones. \n\nToday's elementary schoolers are pretty much \"back to normal\" with a lot not even really remembering the pandemic. But my current high schoolers still have a lot of gaps and a lot of struggles, and there are huge gulfs between those with parents proactive enough to help them catch up and those without.",

When my son finally got sick and tested positive last week, I texted the WhatsApp group immediately after the diagnosis and immediately, 4 parents replied that their kids had been sick last week with it.... Like, Jesus Christ, people, I don't care *in the slightest* about the *constant* discussions about This Month's Fundraiser.

There were winners and losers, and that didn't divide on generational lines.\u00a0\n\n\nDifficult to answer this without sounding like I'm bragging, so I won't sugarcoat. I went through lockdowns with two young kids, wife and I in late 30s and, honestly, once you got over the shock of there being effectively no respite, for *us* it really wasn't that bad, but then we're comparatively privileged.\n\n\n\u00a0We own a detached house and garden in a small town. We switched seamlessly to remote work and had no money worries. We came out the other side into booming wages (first time in a generation in the UK) and lots of opportunities as a result of the great resignation. We both changed careers, I am now 100% remote and I earn more than double what I did 5 years ago. The value of our house also boomed as a result of the \"race for space\" and our mortgage shrank in size vs income, inflation, house value etc.\u00a0\n\n\nI honestly am weirdly nostalgic about certain things. The excitement when the shopping got delivered, watching *Tiger King* and drinking wine, Zoom pub quizzes etc, zero pressure to do anything on weekends, long walks with the kids and Sunday roasts. So many barbecues. Drinking beer in the garden whilst the kids played. Covid was honestly fine for us. Our children were little enough it didn't hold them back and lockdown just seemed to cement a bond between them that still holds today. In fact, I'd say it brought the 4 of us closer together.\u00a0\n\n\nWould I be saying the same thing if I'd gone through covid in insecure employment, living in inadequate housing, followed up by years of rapid rent rises? If, as a result of the lockdown delivery boom, I now had to make a living delivering parcels to smug, lazy, middle class twats like myself? If my kids were that bit older and had developmental issues through missing school or socialising? If I spent lockdown going quietly crazy in a rented room in a flatshare with people I didn't really know in a big city somewhere with no garden or just stuck on my own? If I was stuck living with an abusive partner or parent?\u00a0\n\n\nAlmost certainly not, yet this range of experiences was all felt within the millennial age bracket, from young couples who spent the time furloughed and chilling right the way through to families whose lives were ruined due to not being included in the covid support schemes and work dried up.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat covid did here (and I'm sure this applied elsewhere) was forensically expose inequality. It was well and truly \"tide out, let's see who's swimming naked\" time. Your take on that era and the fallout will almost entirely reflect your level of affluence or fortune. What is really interesting is how we seem to have taken precisely 0 from that.\u00a0",

I think I had it bad as a young parent working a high demand job (55-60 hours a week) with a 15 month old and no childcare support for years on end was one of the worst things to happen to me- especially when I was already burnt out..\u00a0\n\nHere was my normal day during the pandemic :\u00a0\n\nWake up at 5 am- conference calls with Germany and EU colleagues until 8 am.\u00a0\n\n8am-12pm : back to back meetings with US teams- getting my daughter dressed and fed while on a conference call. (No food or drink for me).\u00a0Back to back calls to lunch- feeding my daughter snacks and/or lunch on a conference call. \u00a0If I was lucky I could grab food between calls. If I had a meeting that ended early, I was usually running to the bathroom, or trying to take a quick shower and change my clothes for the day.( Most days I wasn\u2019t showered and dressed until 2-3pm. )\n\u00a0\n1:00pm - lay my daughter \u00a0down for a nap-during her naptime, \u00a0I had a good 2 hour block to actually do my work.\u00a0\n\n3pm-5pm more calls. Either my husband or I would take on dinner. It was usually something quick or something processed. My husband would take the kids to watch them for the night.\u00a0\n\nThen I would go back to work.\n5pm-6pm \u00a0was calls with Japan and China (sometimes these would go on until 9pm at night).\u00a0\n\nThen 9pm- kids are in bed, it\u2019s my work time again. I would answer emails, create training presentations, do all the work I needed to catch up on. Most nights I was in bed by 12, some nights I worked until 2-3 am.\u00a0\n\nRinse and repeat. Everyday for almost 2 years. I think the longest I worked was a 90 day stretch straight. I worked 12+ hours over the weekend days and worked every week day. I felt guilty when I took my first weekend to actually have a break.\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t have anytime to think to myself. My daughter- desperately needed 1:1 attention. She would frequently get upset or need help. So I\u2019m trying to speak to the team and then trying to help her . Occasionally my stepson needed school help, but I was honestly really lucky he already knew how to read. My coworkers with kindergartners had to sit and facilitate their kids learning because they couldn\u2019t read to operate a tablet. I CANNOT imagine how hard that was to be working a high stress job and doing that every day.\n\nAll the while, constantly worrying about your kids, feeling guilty about not providing enough attention for them, they\u2019re going stir crazy in the house, worried about losing your job and being able to provide, worrying about absolutely everything. Not a single one of my issues actually revolved around me missing my life as a 30 year old or missing out. Hobbies? Free time? Rest time? Did not exist.\u00a0\n\nIt was pure hell. Every single day.\u00a0\n\nHow does that compare to your experience? I don\u2019t think it can and I don\u2019t think either one needs to invalidate the other.\u00a0",

And honestly should be the main topic anyone born in-scope of these generations should care about. Definitely shouldn't be about missing prom where you pay $100 to hang out with people that don't actually like you and you'll likely never talk to after high school is done (and I have friends today, so don't try and say 'that's because you don't have friends' or something along those lines).\n\nAnd this issue has more to be concerned with than just home ownership itself. This is causing people to not have kids anymore. For the rest of their lives realistically. They can't afford housing. How can they have kids at this rate?\n\nWe will also just lose entire jobs/careers. Teaching will get so horrible because everyone knows they don't pay well. If that trend keeps up while the cost of buying shelter continues sky rocketing up, teaching and many other professionals will be at a skeleton's pace. \n\nThe list goes on.

Essentially the Tories had spent years making so many 'efficiency cuts' to the NHS that it was basically always hovering around 99% occupancy for half the year, which is juuuuust about workable. At least until, it turns out, there's a surge in demand for hospital services.\n\nSo our lockdowns were a bit weird. They weren't ever about *preventing* COVID outright since ofc that was borderline impossible but the thinking was, of the percentage of people whose infection got so serious they required hospitalisation due to laboured breathing etc., they knew that 3 out of 4 people would still survive with medical intervention such as ventilators and whatnot. But without intervention, that number is way too close to 0 out of 4 for comfort.\n\nCombine the Tories cuts to the NHS with that reality and you've got a situation where lockdown was the only way to temper out the infection rate enough to ensure that people didn't *avoidably* die to COVID due to a lack of hospital beds.\n\nYou know, in a weird way, it's a perfect illustration of just how expensive it is to be cheap. We saved a little bit of cash by spending a little bit less on the NHS for a while, and proceeded to haemorrhage orders of magnitudes more cash because of lockdowns we only needed due to those cuts.",

Late- 20s - mid-30s is a time when a lot of those changes are happening anyway: relationships becoming more serious or hitting their breaking point, people are moving away from a lot of socializing and going out to having more insular friend groups or being more solitary. COVID accelerated all of that, but, compared to young kids and teens and parents of young kids and teens, I tink the impact on Millennials in that stage of life was relatively less drastic",

Quickly having to transition to online learning was crazy and then the whole 2020-2021 school year was extra terrible because at that point you had parents who didn't believe in COVID (or schools changing anything to deal with it) who were super contentious with parents and educators who were still wanting to make COVID accomodations. School board meetings were emotional hotbeds.\n\nSo I think kids during that time had it worse--both younger ones due to the disruption of super critical, foundation learning and the older ones due to missing out on the traditional American high school experience.",

How they recover depends on a myriad of factors, but there\u2019s no denying that younger kids were impacted. For a while sick kids could only have ONE parent/caregiver with them in the hospital. I know people who are still angry with hospitals for visitor restrictions. \n\nOn the other end, older adults had it incredibly hard. Loneliness is an epidemic in older adults and covid just exploded this problem. I worked in a hospital during covid and I can tell you without question that people being unable to be present with loved ones when they are serious ill and/or dying has lasting impacts. My grandfather died in April 2020 and my grandma had to beg borrow and steal to get in to see him before he died. They were married for over 60 years. Older adults are at higher risk for grief complications, including their own death. Being unable to participate in normal death and dying rituals is not good for humans. \n\nNot to mention how nursing home care was eroded and still hasn\u2019t recovered. Entire wings of nursing homes sit empty because of covid. Our population is aging rapidly and the long term care situation in the US is an absolute nightmare. If you have an aging parent as a millennial, I highly recommend you educate yourself on long-term care just to be prepared for the coming shitstorm. \n\nI agree that we don\u2019t need to have some kind of trauma Olympics over Covid. You can have a personal experience that was really difficult and impactful while recognizing there are communities who had greater systemic issues and impacts. \n\nLike I said, I worked in a hospital - including in a Covid ICU. I very literally watched people die from this disease and then saw the post pandemic health impacts of people \u201clost to care\u201d because of delayed care. It was hard but I also had a steady (financially) job as did my spouse (also working in healthcare) and we didn\u2019t have kids at the time. We lived in a very affordable apartment and could walk or bike to work. We had a home gym pre-pandemic and lived right on a walking/biking trail. I read a lot of books and did a lot of puzzles and worked out a ton. I didn\u2019t even get COVID until 2022. I got vaccinated in 12/2020. Some people might argue working in healthcare \u201cwas the hardest\u201d but for me, in honestly wasn\u2019t for a lot of reasons. I am not built for remote work. I interacted with people, in person, every single day. \n\nSo much of it is relative.",

Loneliness is an epidemic in older adults and covid just exploded this problem.\n\nOn top of this, so many older adults aren't good with technology, which was the only way that many people were able to be social.\n\nDuring Covid, I spent many hours on Discord servers, Zoom, and playing games online with friends of mine that I wasn't able to physically be with. I can't imagine too many elderly people socialized like that.\n\nBecause of that, and the very obvious drawbacks that school-aged kids/teens had, I would argue that Millenials might've been the *least* impacted generation. We weren't in our formative years *and* we knew how to socialize using the internet.",

We need and crave social interaction, this has been hard to come by for some communities and throwing events on a budget is hard for some towns and cities. \n\nMy library system has been good about keeping things going in person because they have the buildings to host it, but work hours seems to have extended so less and less people can join.\n\nThe end game is how much can we work them down and split them up to prevent issues.\n\nThe only problem with that is the amount of people who will be or are unemployed whether that be from lays offs in the private or federal sectors or the people they once paid and items they once bought that will no longer be there due to tightening budgets at home. The tariffs at large will cause more layoffs. All of that to say more protests, more community and maybe changing what was the outcome of all of us who had a hard time leaving the house.\n\nI think this was a moment where we fell apart due to covid, started spiralling due to economy and are about to hit rock bottom but have the chance to rise above coming up and I hope we take it together and rebuild a better way.",

I fear that\u2019s gonna end in anxiety generations down the line.\nAlthough kids do bounce back quick I guess so maybe not. But then there\u2019s also: teenagers. Like as in fresh in puberty, 12/13/14 years old. Being confined to internet only 100000% genuinely rotted a lot of brains. That\u2019s gonna be rough in a few decades.\n\nAnd also old people. I feel like the old ones who weren\u2019t able to really understand but still \u201caware enough\u201d to notice something weird happening but having 0 understanding as to why nobody can come visit, etc. dying alone and confused bc nobody close to them can be there to explain.\n\nI think old people alone have had it worse just bc of that. The other ones still around and kicking obv also got a major issue from it- look at all these boomers fucking over the planet left and right, completely away from reality and absolutely not rational or reasonable at all anymore. Entitled as fuck, rude as fuck, racist as fuck.. smth made them snap in their old age, coupled with isolation.\n\nSo idk. I feel like we kinda just trotted through it bc what rly changed for us.\n\nPerspective? Always been \u201cmeh\u201d anyways. Social circles? Where, who, we?? Outside? lol.\n\nIdk. I think we\u2019re a little bit of the apathy generation so it felt like not a lot changed.\n\n..honestly I liked the masks. And the distancing. And the world being quiet outside. I liked the statistic and bc of that knowing that if humanity disappeared, nature reclaims its space.\n\nBirds got quieter again, songs got more intricate again, animals where able to actually exist bc cars and planes and humans where not everywhere constantly like an ant farm just made to destruct itself..\n\nAnyways.\nMy 2 cents.",

            "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic was certainly rough for everyone, and its effects are still felt across the board. I feel as though the younger generation, like Gen Z and Gen Alpha, got it the worst. Kids in elementary school and pre-K during the 2020 lockdown often didn\u2019t step foot back into a classroom consistently until 2021. Left at home trying to figure out Chromebooks and troubleshoot their PCs, many had little to no help, especially if their parents were working or, in some cases, not at home at all. These kids, with the older ones now entering high school, lost a full year and a half of their education and have been struggling to keep up.\n\nI\u2019d also say Gen Z faced significant challenges because many were in high school or college when the pandemic hit, disrupting crucial developmental years. They missed out on key experiences like in-person learning, socializing, internships, and early career opportunities. The transition to remote learning was abrupt, and not everyone had the resources or support to adapt. Now, many are entering the workforce with gaps in education, limited job experience, and increased anxiety about their future. The long-term effects on their mental health and career prospects are still unfolding.\n\nI\u2019d say we, millennials, made it out okay, but still rough for everyone. Younger ones are the most hurt, and we\u2019ll likely feel those effects for years to come.",

My husband was told to work remotely in March of 2019, so the only complaint he had was not getting to go to the baby appointments with me, although the nurse during an ultrasound said she'd let me Skype with him during so he could see (wasn't supposed to, but she let me anyway). We both had covid at one point (thankfully not at the same time), but quarantined away from the kids in the guest room, so they were safe. We'd go for drives if we got cabin fever, and traded off going to the grocery store. \n\nHonestly, I feel for those who had it much worse than we did. As an only child, I had ways to keep myself entertained when the kids were napping. We read a lot of books, watched a lot of movies, did crafts, I crocheted several projects. The worst for me was not being able to visit my side of the family for several months, as we're close.",

She doesn't even know when she'll be able to start saving again, let alone when she'll be able to retire. My Gen Z sister was set to graduate a year early and had to repeat her senior year because she couldn't keep her focus with school from home. She's lost all desire to socialize but has been in the same cruddy relationship since lockdown because she doesn't want to be alone. Isolation made my grandma so desperate for social interaction that she's now allowing people to take advantage of her because they'll come around more often. She wasn't one to put up with anyone's shit before. My Gen Alpha Daughter was doing so well in her preschool but lockdown crippled her social skills and experienced the educational \"slide.\"\n\nFor me it was a huge set back in progress on things that I was already struggling with. My depression, my goals, my career, I had to restart all of my work from the beginning. Some of it had to be completely reworked to suit the situation left by lockdown.\n\nIf it seems like our generation has it worse, it's only because you're in it. You hear more from the people who can relate to your struggles, so of course those will seem like THE struggles that came out of this. I'm sure that there are struggles that I'm not noticing simply because I have so many of my own now, but we have to try to be empathetic anyway.",

High school and college age in particular, when you're breaking out and doing your own thing and making friends and getting ahead.\n\nAt 39 now, 35ish in 2020, I was well established in my career that I could work remotely and owned my home with three kids at home.  It was certainly difficult managing all of that at once, but in a few ways was also more like my \"ideal\" life than 2019 was or 2025 is.  For my kids (then around 2-7), there were definitely downsides, but not exclusively so, and some upsides too.  I miss having time free from activities and especially other peoples' obligations.\n\nWhat did I lose?  I'm already in a good place as a millennial and missed out on chances to improve my situation even more due to kind of staying in place - not moving to a larger house in 2020-2022 or something, and now feeling like even having been on the ladder that everything is so much more expensive.\n\nI masked and followed various protocols longer and harder than most (until about Sept 2023 everywhere basically) because of the risk of COVID/Long COVID to my kids - I still mask in many situations like travel, doctor visits, grocery stores, etc, though typically not at work or school these days.\n\nAs noted, I also kind of feel like I leapt from 35 to 40 quite suddenly, and a lot of feeling of kind of lost opportunities or this being a make-or-break point on things is hitting me very hard. For example - in my \"starter house\" - is this really my kids' hometown and where we're \"from\" or are we moving?  I wanted to move 5 years ago.  I don't like their school.

This led to nurses who had hardly ever touched a patient being let loose to practice. Bad for everyone. So gen alpha and anyone in school really suffered. I think it also really isolated elderly people, which can lead to depression and giving up at life. It was also bad for parents raising covid babies (I was one) because they missed first experiences, baby photos, family coming to visit in many cases, daycare etc. So no, I don't think covid was particularly worse for millennials.

My older brother was able to buy a 2500 sq foot 275k home in a nice area in 2019. That home is now worth almost 500k. He wouldn\u2019t be able to live anywhere in that area. Wouldn\u2019t be able to go to those schools.. meanwhile my wife and I bought in 2022 when the interest rate was 6.25%. For about 250k.

Looking back at it today, we can see each side of the political spectrum did things right, while each side did things wrong. \n\nMy wife & I became first time parents 2 weeks into the pandemic and I would never want to repeat that hell. The saying it takes a village to raise a child is 100% true, and when the village is closed, you are fucked in ways unimaginable. My child\u2019s first several Easter\u2019s, Thanksgivings, Christmases were not with the family. I worked extremely early hours so my wife and I could both be full-time while having 20 hours of childcare per week. It fucking destroyed us. \n\nI know OP said they feel there were many missed opportunities, and there were. The older set of Millennials weee around OP\u2019s age when the Great Recession began, so they got smoked twice. Candidly, because my wife & I got smoked by the Great Recession (I lost everything and could not continue an advanced degree, but got six figures in debt to pay off), we hedged our plans from the lessons of that time and emerged economically and financially better than when COVID began. \n\nMy advice to anyone listening as we approach another set of uncharted waters is the while the pandemic was an introvert\u2019s dream, the current climate requires everyone to put on their extrovert hat.  You have to reconnect with friends and neighbors. You have to find a cause or a mission you believe in and to give your time. When things are uncertain, having a large & diverse set of connections may become your lifeline if you lose your job.

She is in 4th grade now and I would say half the class is at a 1st/2nd grade level for reading/math/writing and it\u2019s hard for the teachers to teach them since so many kids are so far behind. Thankfully I am a stay at home mom(and have been for 9 years) and was able to help her catch up but many parents don\u2019t have the time and it\u2019s really hurt this generation. I am sure it\u2019s the same with older kids too. My youngest is in kindergarten now and it\u2019s crazy to see the difference in his education now than what my daughter had at that age since he is actually able to be in school in person and interact with his peers.

So she started a new school hybrid while needing an IEP. This put her behind both academically and socially. It took her another year before she made friends and part of that was because she had no lunch of recess (hybrid model was half kids go in AM, the rest in PM, lunch at home). \n\nShe\u2019s caught up now but of course next year in 8th grade her school will be in trailers while it\u2019s renovated, which I feel like robs her of another normal year.",

From my understanding, kids are still trying to catch up in school and they may never get there at this point, given the current state of things in that vein.\n\nKids are resilient, but I think people underestimate the long-reaching effects of something that traumatic on young people who are still developing and will have to integrate that trauma into their identity vs adults who have even a little bit more agency over how they handle something like that.\n\nIdk, I think being a little older and wiser does give us a bit of an easier time in that context.",

They have a \"laptop at home day\". \n\nI was an adult with freedom, disposable income, and limited income so I do lament losing some of that time before the responsibility of having a family kicked in.

Ended up getting pretty badly hurt in a crash which blew out my left knee and required 3 surgeries, insane pain, and months unable to walk. Years later I'm still not 100%, and haven't been able to do my favorite activists like snowboarding, mountain biking, running etc. \n\nI have times when I get depressed and wished I did things differently, but I also remember that I never would have and I was trying to live out my life in the way I had always wanted. I enjoyed the shit out of it for awhile. Anyways, point being, it's what you make it. In some ways I'm in a worse spot than I was before covid, in other ways I'm much better. Yeah I had this awful experience, but I also learned a ton about myself as a person and I was lucky to meet an amazing woman who I never would have met without all of these experiences. \n\nThat's life man. Bad shit happens, then good shit comes out of it, good shit happens then bad shit comes out of it. I need to take this advice now as much as anyone as I've been struggling lately, but you have to make your life what you want it to be. If you want life to be exciting you have to make it that way. Sure circumstances can make that much harder but you can't control those. You can control you. I'll leave you with this, one of my favorite\nquotes ever. It's from Viktor Frankel, a survivor of Auschwitz who lost his whole family in the holocaust: \n\n\"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u2014to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own ways\".",

If anything, it opened doors to making my career transition better.\n\n\nI left HR before the pandemic and switched to working in tech.

That was rough, but I managed it and built some more solid job experience.

Because we had folks move in from across country, we also had reason to stay remote after the callbacks started.\n\n\nIt killed some of my momentum for sure, but my industry was also very affected by it, so I don't think I could've avoided it even if I'd tried.

Huge career and social impact.\n\nSilent Gen many were in retirement living and either had extended quarantines ruin already limited social lives or major death tolls tear through friends.\n\nAlpha next worst hit. In primary school when they should be learning to socialize, and just end up even more screen dependant. Some managed fine but many may end up socially stunted.\n\nMillennials were mixed bag with huge variation based on job type, housing situation, social situation, etc.\n\nI\u2019m in an IT adjacent space, and wound up being obscenely busy the moment everything shut down. Small group of friends and everyone\u2019s social efforts contracted so that was pretty lonely. Fortunately already tied, so I wasn\u2019t seeking a relationship, which must have been a bit nightmarish. Had been eyeing up first home purchase and saw that rug absolutely ripped from in front of me. Saved hyper-aggressively and still ended up with a dramatically larger mortgage two years later than I otherwise would have bought, _and_ a longer commute. Still salty, and unlikely to ever fully get over that. \n\nX\u2019ers and Boomers were most likely to be in sheltered careers, or at a reasonable time for retirement. Many struggled but at least for the many I interact with frequently, the social, family and living situations were mostly in place and the struggles were either tech adaptation, or annoyance over travel restrictions.\n\nDespite all that, I still think Z, Silents and any Alphas old enough to appreciate it were dealt the worst hand.\n\nThe momentum and buzzkill sentiments are definitely relatable though.",

I'm really glad they were already in 7nd grade or so when the shutdown happened, so they were already acclimated at school and had it easier to go full digital. The class that had changed from 4th to 5th grade - so elementary to ... high school? ... really was fucked. And those from 1st to 4th class anyway.\n\nBut even so, our kids lost a LOT of socialising and really important events like class trips etc. Those few years from 1-18 go so damn fast. Those 4 years won't ever come back and a lot of important memories never happen. It's a shame.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I believe the shutdowns were needed and we didn't have any plan for a epidemic like this. Especially the first two years sucked hard, but without much knowledge about the virus and experience with the situation .. it was the best we had. And still we failed at so many parts.\n\nWe can be glad this virus was not as deadly as some the contagious movie one with a 30-40% kill rate. We wouldn't even have any discussions about vaccinations, as even the hardest critique would want to get one.\n\nFor me those were simply some lost or \"special\" years. I was almost 40 at that time. Those 3-4 years won't really make a dent. But for my kids it was bad.\n\nNot that they have a lasting damage from it. But I really would've liked for them to create a lot of awesome memories like I had. Not always the best, but still important.",

It was a major contributing factor to accelerating my burnout. It severely impacted my mental health, and was probably the biggest reason why I only had 1 kid. I just struggled to cope with a 15 month old- trying to provide 1:1 childcare while also working a demanding 55+ hours a week and trying to work at night, getting only a few hours of sleep at night and just feeling immensely behind and overwhelmed. I remember trying to help my stepson do remote learning and trying to take care of my daughter\u2019s needs and just going into a bathroom to sob on a routine basis.

She was covered the dogs were covered, every inch of the first floor was covered furniture, rugs etc. Everything was so hard to vacuum, couldn\u2019t be mopped. I just sobbed for a good 2 hours before I spent the rest of the day cleaning. I was just so overloaded. I remember feeling so scared, trying to prepare my family, fearing never ending supply chain shortages. Would we have enough food? What if we all lost our jobs, how would we provide? there was no handbook for being a parent to young kids in a pandemic quarantine. There was no village, no help\u2026 it was not fun. \u00a0\n\nI have no experience to compare to Gen Z\u2019s experience. I think it would suck to have high school disrupted. But it\u2019s hard for me to compare that to my situation because I only lived 1 of them, and again, it was 2-3 of the worst years of my entire life.\u00a0",

            "body": "I know my situation isn\u2019t like everyone else\u2019s, but I actually thrived during COVID. \n\nMy (now) husband and I met in January 2020. We lived in different cities 4 hours apart and only got to see each other every few weeks. When lockdown happened he came to stay with me because we didn\u2019t want to be isolated alone. If lockdown hadn\u2019t have happened, our relationship would not have progressed the way it did at the speed it did. Going from \u201cnew relationship\u201d to literally together 24/7\u201d put our relationship in turbo drive. We got married in 2022. \n\nMy partner is a university professor and he teaches at different universities. Usually he is able to teach around 4 courses per semester, and has to travel between universities if he has classes at different institutions. Because of lockdown everything moved online and he was able to take on a lot more work. There was one semester where he was able to teach 10 classes! Obviously this isn\u2019t sustainable and I wouldn\u2019t want him to do that all the time, but teaching FAR more classes than normal because they all moved online allowed us to save up a down payment for a house. We bought our house in 2022. That would not have been possible without Covid. \n\nBecause my work moved online I was able to go back to school and get a masters degree while working full time. Again, this would not have been possible without Covid. Honestly the circumstances around Covid and our particular industries meant both my husband and I really thrived professionally during Covid. \n\nI even kind of thrived socially during Covid in a weird way. I was more mindful about actually reaching out to friends and family and talking to people because otherwise the isolation would have been really depressing. Video calls became more normal than they were before. We organized virtual game nights. In the summers (after vaccines were released) we started meeting outside and having camp fires. My friend group was just much more active in seeking eachother out (in distanced ways), it wasn\u2019t something we just expected to happen organically. Those relationships are stronger now than ever. \n\nSo did Covid steal some things from my life? Sure. It was stressful and scary and isolating at times. But it also gave me so so much more in a really condensed timeline that would not have been possible otherwise.",

My sister lost her last two years of college to remote learning and didn\u2019t get the true college experience those years. Her entire work life has been mostly remote. For Gen Alpha, it depends when they were born. Early alphas have it rough as elementary remote learning is not a great method at all.

            "body": "Absolutely worse for younger generations and it's backup by numbers and data everywhere you look at it. \n\nI started working in 2019 in information technology, and in 2021 was when I finally got to a salary where I thought I could do it all in New Jersey, which was $91k. In 2021, I was looking at lower $300k houses which were easily: 1800+ sq ft, 3+ beds, 2 car garages, basements, all types of desirable traits. But then, my parent got ill and I had to take care of them financially and physically.\n\nFast forward to 2024 when I was ready again, and luckily I saved a bit more money, and I was now making $118k a year. \n\nWell, tought shit for me. Because similarly spec'ed houses that WERE sub $300k in 2021, were now $450k-$550k, on top of being in a competitive market where the decent houses never went for listed price. They went $20k-$30k over. You'd think \"well, you're spending $400k+ on a house, what's another $20k-$30k?\".\n\nWell, there's a thing called \"appraisal gaps\". The short of it is: if you have a $500k house, and you bid $520k, you NEED to have an appraisal gap of $20k in your offer. This states that if the house only appraises for $500k, you as the buyer is saying \"I will cover the additional $20k anyways\". BUT. For the BANK to loan that $500k OUT to you as the BUYER, YOU MUST have the additional $20k at the closing table. IN CASH. So yeah, that's an extra out of pocket expense, on TOP of closing costs, down payment, and all the other well known out-of-pocket costs. \n\nBefore older generations get on me about the appraisal gap and why would a buyer pay it, very simple. Leverage and supply and demand. If I don't want to pay that gap, guess what? There are 4+ qualified buyers right behind me in line hoping I don't, so THEY can finally get a house and pay that amount. Because likely, they've also been looking for a very long time. And 20+ years from now and if you're buying long term, do you truly care about $20k extra now? It seems like a lot today, but 20 years from now, $20k might be a movie ticket. \n\nAnd why wouldn't the seller side pay the gap? Well... Read my previous sentences again.\n\nTl;Dr: in 2021 with a $91k salary I was able to buy a house on my own. Life happened with my parent.\n Then The same spec'ed house today in 2024 not only required my salary to go up to $118k, but I also need my girlfriend's salary of $50k so we are not housepoor and can still actually save/invest some of our money.",

My first kid was going into kindergarten for the first time and it was brutal to watch him interact all day long with a mask on that was never allowed to come off. His first moments in school were so messed up. They were not allowed to talk to other children during lunch time and then they all ended up getting Covid anyways because those masks don't stop viruses at all anyways. Then his birthday was no one allowed to attend plus we had another kid during that time so there was a baby all of a sudden. Ontop of all that his teachers were the worst. We got stuck with old hags that should have retired years ago that treated little boys like garbage not allowing them to eat any sugary snacks at all. Thankfully he's a champ but I can't help but think how shitty of a start that was for that generation. Also he had to go to two funerals of close relatives in the same week and then the dog died as well a few months later. What a shit show. I can't imagine how it must have been for high schoolers.",
