    "selftext": "Wife and I are homeowners in a decent, working-class area. We have careers that pay well enough. We have two kids who we love dearly. We\u2019ve worked hard to build a life for ourselves. In spite of all that, every day just seems like more and more of a struggle, particularly financially. \n\nEvery time we think we\u2019re getting ahead, life just steals from us. If it\u2019s not insurance coming after us demanding that we fix tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff on the house in order to front run policyholder claims, it\u2019s groceries slowly creeping up to nearly 1/5th of our income despite buying mostly generic stuff from Walmart. \n\nIf someone had told me ten years ago that the amount of money I make today is merely *ok*, I\u2019d ask them if WW3 happened or if there was an economic collapse or something. Sadly, it\u2019s just real life: a family of four making lower six figures is living little better than our parents did 30 years ago. \n \nHow long can this be sustained? I can\u2019t be the only person wondering this. ",

If its this bad now, how bad will it be when its time for them to buy a home? My hope is that they will live at home as long as possible, I want to teach them to save all their money - use their time living at home as a way to get ahead. We bought a house on the bigger side for this reason, room to grow and live here as long as you want.",

We both have Masters degrees - his in Divinity/theology, mine in leadership - but I work in the nonprofit sector and wage increases and retirement matches have been hard to come by for my entire career. He's a pastor who recently left a crumbling church that lied about their actual financial status. We have three kids and live in a suburb and it's as you said totally unsustainable, especially as our parents' generation has been able to \"retire\" but will likely drain their savings and investments on any end of life medical care, which is also ridiculously expensive. Then what? How will our generation find financial stability later in life? \n\nWe're also seeing a lot of our friends approaching their 20th year in their career and getting laid off. It's a very scary time.",

Got a nice house (DO NOT mention the mortgage), two great kids yet live paycheck to paycheck. My husband earns a great wage and I do some consultancy work that fits around the kids. Yet we have to do side hustles to break even each month. His quarterly bonus is spent before it comes in. \n\nTen years ago if you had told me our family would be \"just living\" on the combined income we have then I would have laughed in your face. \n\nAt night I lie awake and worry about our pensions and whether we'll have any (positive) legacy to pass onto our children. \n\nDebit is a bit issue with about 1/5 of our monthly income going on that. But we're trying our best to get out of that but it's so bloody slow. There's less room for fun which is a bit depressing. Fortunately the kids are at an age where they just want to hang out with us. They don't notice we go on holidays to a caravan owned by a family friend whilst their friends jet off on holidays abroad. \n\nI appreciate we're very lucky. But my God, everything feels such a fucking grind. My eldest needs new PE shoes as his current ones are falling to bits. We need to wait until next month's pay to sort that out. And it looks like he'll need a bigger size of school clothes before the end of the school year. Every purchase now comes with a pause of \"Where's that money coming from?\" \n\nTLDR: Fed up living paycheck to paycheck with no end in sight.",

We would only move if we could pay all cash which we could do now to move up to a much bigger house in the same neighborhood but looking at overpriced homes the last 8+ months with 7%+ interest rates it is just not worth it.

Our current home is a good size for us 4, a smallest home in the nicest neighborhood with excellent schools. \n\nWe figured when our kids go off to college in 15 years, we would downsize to our 2223 sq ft home anyway so we rather save and invest for early retirement and travel. But right now is definitely not the time to move as there have been restructuring at my company recently and it is kind of unknown with budgets slashed etc.. Luckily my wife can go full time as they been asking and the medical industry is pretty bullet proof. But anyway, we save/invest 40% of our income yearly. It's sad though because I feel that everyone in every part of the middle class for millennials definitely live a lower standard of living than they did growing up in the 90s...
