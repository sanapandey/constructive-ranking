    "selftext": "I just looked through my saved Snapchats from 2015-2018 and I was cringe, but I was free. Trashy nightclub selfies. Smoking from a bong and giggling with friends in the dorm cafeteria. \n\nNow I'm married, my friends are all getting married, everyone has serious jobs and responsibilities. No one posts on social media anymore, which is fine, but I miss old social media. Now no one wants to be perceived and you can't see your friends' posts without scrolling through ads, influencers, and AI slop. I haven't been to the club in a long time and the last time I went it was post pandemic and the vibes were off. ",

Looking to steal milk crates, hook up, sell drugs, and start fights. Or just sit around at a table scrolling a phone. I avoid places like that.\n\nAll my \"Get Married\" school friends are still somewhat in touch. Paths just change. I've made new circles of friends in different interests to have fun again. As an adult, dedicated community events, or meetup groups, sports leagues, the gym, etc. are the best way to go. Individual hangouts with school friends are just really hard to coordinate otherwise. Usually just see each other once every couple of years somewhere or another.",
