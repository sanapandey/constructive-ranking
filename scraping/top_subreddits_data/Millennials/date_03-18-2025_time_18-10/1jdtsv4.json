Then set their house on fire and shot himself. \n\nUnclear if he doused them with gasoline too or just the house. This was after the child pulling her eyelashes out and the whiskers of her cat due to fear and stress of her father killing her. It was reported to CPS and police but later closed at the request of the mother. \n\nThe rumor is that burt Reynolds requested a closed studio to finish his lines and needed 63 takes to do it. Never confirmed by him but it was claimed in a tik tok video - very likely in an attempt to get clicks with zero proof. Burt died in 2018 so no confirmation coming.",

Us little ones only understood the funny cartoons acting silly, and the parents got a kick out of the jokes that went over our heads\u2026 movies still do this, sure not like the 80\u2019s/90\u2019s, but there\u2019s so much stuff in children\u2019s movies for the parents that just don\u2019t register to a child\u2026 I just watched Moana 2 with my kids, and my husband and I were cracking up at the innuendos and our kids were like \u201cwhy are you laughing at that, but not the fart joke? Hahha farts!!!\u201d  Or they just think we don\u2019t understand Moana\u2019s nuances \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but us parents need something to keep us engaged, while engaging the children\u2026 and that\u2019s how you get movies that are a hit at home and will watched a lot because it\u2019s funny for all parties involved.
