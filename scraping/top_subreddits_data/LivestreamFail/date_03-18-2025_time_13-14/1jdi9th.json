Papa Johns was always the pizza ordered for parties/school events as a kid and it was just as disappointing then as it is now. For a while in the US Dominos was not great, but they revamped their business and now serve the best pizza of the 3 chains, with the better deals as well. Pizza Hut has not had any change in special/coupon items as they did when I worked there (I used to work at a Pizza Hut) back in 2015.\nI also find that their crust flavor i substantially better than Pizza Hut, which was my favorite at the time because of their crust specifically. I would argue Pizza Hut would only be the choice to go with if you specifically want stuff crust. It will cost a pretty penny though",

I know Dominos founder retired and the company was sold in 1999. Food quality suffered and competition got better. \n\nDomino's, to it's credit, made a lot of big changes over the past decade and did improve a lot. It's solid for a pizza chain now. Better seasoning than most.\n\nPizza Hut never got better. Pizza Hut is bottom of the barrel. \n\nPapa John's is the best of the \"national chain\" Pizza places. Better sauce than the others, and higher quality ingredients.\n\nMost people just gave up on Domino's in the 2000s and never gave it another chance after it improved. \n\nBurger King was a similar story. Huge in the 90s. Looked at as a joke in the last couple decades.",

Was the first of the American pizza chains to get a few stores across the country, was great for a while but once Dominos and Papa Johns came it really shown how poor it was in comparison and never improved. I guess living in a town saved Domino's graces for us because I don't recall it was here around 2009 or prior.\n\nBurger King also the same situation really. Mcdonalds was always favoured, they'd be about 10 to 1 stores in favour of Mcdonalds in the cities and that's probably putting it lightly. Now Burger King is much more preferred (at least with family/friends/colleagues I speak to)",

Pizza Hut is utter garbage that no one should eat. Dominos and Little Caesars are both in the middle, but each have their own niche.",
