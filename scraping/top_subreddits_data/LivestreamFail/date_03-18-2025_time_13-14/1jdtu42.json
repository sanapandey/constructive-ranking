Its a PVP video game, there are winners and losers, that doesnt mean winning makes you a 'bully'.\n\nOften times you will fight players who are brand new or experienced in any game, thats how it works usually. If someone beats a new player in COD, are they a bully? or if I beat a new player in Street Fighter, does that make me a bully?",
