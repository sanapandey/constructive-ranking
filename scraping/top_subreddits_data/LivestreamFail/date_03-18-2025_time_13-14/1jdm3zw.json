Every time he gets close to winning, some clown on mic starts spamming the worst noise imaginable and trying to run him over with a car. Are you seriously that sad, dude? You know Forsen\u2019s just trying to vibe and play, but these snipers are out here ruining every match, yelling in the mic like they\u2019ve never seen a keyboard in their life.",
