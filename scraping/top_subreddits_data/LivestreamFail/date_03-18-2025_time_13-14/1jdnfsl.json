(even if warlocks would rebanish mobs theres always atleast 1% chance tor resist, in mc gear it might be 1-3% more, if you stand there as a top healer you might die before any shaman can even NS you.",

Yes she ultimately dies because of the banish fails, but its only because of a combination of both banish breaks + bad positioning. She put herself in a position to be killed by banish breaking.\n\nNow your second and third paragraph is just frankly weird nonsense, the big streamers you like are not braindead, they KNOW if they play/network with streamers who have not even 5% of their viewership, they are giving them a chance to grow, quite frankly it speaks for itself that the people she plays with keep playing with and speak positively of her.",
