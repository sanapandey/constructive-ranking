We have nearly two full generations of society that doesn't listen to men, actively downplays their problems at best, outright denies that men can have problems at all, or worst admits they have problems but tells them to fix it themselves. Nobody gives a shit about men's problems, and men can feel it.\n\nThen you get a guy like Tate that comes in. He talks to men in a way that makes them feel heard. He validates their problems and their feelings and has genuinely good advice for making yourself better (like you said). The problem is that shuffled into the good advice and recognition of men's problems is a bunch of horrible other things. People like him say just enough good things so that disillusioned men will listen to him, then he takes advantage of it.\n\nHow do we combat that? Simple: acknowledge men's problems, have a shred of sympathy, and help them work through them in a healthy way without all the dogshit on top. Too bad the left still isn't willing to do that.",

But even before they become a Tate-bro, they still get treated exactly how you're treating them now. \n\nNo one cares about empathy, people want solutions. The right offers an easy to accept solution and way out, and the left offers nothing. Nobody is saying to baby them, no one is saying you owe them anything. But if you do nothing then you can't act surprised or mad that they went towards the group that did offer them something.\n\nKind of the same deal with how people don't bother to go out and vote because they're lazy, apathetic, or don't believe it matters, and then they get confused and mad when the fascist with a fervent cult-like following wins and starts ruining the country.",
