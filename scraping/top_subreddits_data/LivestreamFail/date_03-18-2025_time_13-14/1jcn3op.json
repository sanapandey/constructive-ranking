It was my fault, I take blame\". I think he did take fault in one of his twitter posts, but it was in the most handwaving way ever, like \"Oh yeah and maybe I messed up too just like everyone else, anyway\". \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think he also probably wouldn't have received as much backlash if he weren't so overconfident and egotistical. Like he spreads misinformation all the time on his Youtube shorts by being the dumb person's idea of a smart guy. He already irritated a lot of people with his behavior prior, but then getting an industrial excavator to dig your hole even further probably doesn't help.",

The latter, I believe, is due to the number of people that have been and still are being banned for mentioning the drama (even the word \"mana\" gets you banned insta).",

Feels like too many people so quickly dismiss general criticism because a small fraction of it is genuinely despicable. So many times I've seen game devs in particular go on rants on Twitter against overwhelming criticism in general because a small amount of dipshits took it too far. It comes across as a tactic to downplay criticism at this point which is really frustrating to see.",
