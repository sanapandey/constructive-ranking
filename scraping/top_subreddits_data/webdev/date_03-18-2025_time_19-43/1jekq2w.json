    "selftext": "I currently work full time as a developer, i love my day job, it pays well and am pretty secure in my position, but i have an urge to make websites for people on the side. \n\nI don't have the time to go back and forth with a client with endless feedback as i am busy from 9-5, but i am toying with the idea of a basic, but customisable template site, with optional extras (developed beforehand) for an extra cost, with the prerequisite, that you get what you're given, they can view the template site on a demo domain, and i would charge an initial setup fee, and monthly hosting costs, but it would be CHEAP, like \u00a3250 initial and \u00a350 for hosting, with it aimed at small businesses/tradespeople who want to get some form of online presence, dont know how to setup a website themselves, but cant afford to go through an agency\n\nI am also not a designer, and working with another person (i dont know any freelance web designers anyway) would add a lot of extra work, but when someone wants you to 'make them a website', they expect you to design it aswell.\n\nI know people say that raise your costs and you'll get better clients, but i'm looking for low (active) work, low risk, low maintenance, which i wouldn't feel happy charging large amounts for.\n\nWhat are people's opinions on this model?\n\n\n\nFor those interested, the template site is build with laravel using filament for the CMS",
