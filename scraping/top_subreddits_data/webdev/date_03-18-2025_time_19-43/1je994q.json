    "selftext": "I created a webapp for a business that I work for part time (I am a college student). Without giving away too many details it\u2019s basically a custom built scheduler. \n\nI initially went into it for the experience but they want to pay me for it. How much should I ask? This is the first time I\u2019ve ever done anything like this and it\u2019s just me so I\u2019m pretty lost. \n\nI would also be doing all of the hosting etc. so I would have to factor that in too.\n\nIf more information is needed please feel free to let me know, however im not comfortable showing the website.",
