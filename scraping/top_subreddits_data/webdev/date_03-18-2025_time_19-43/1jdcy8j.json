And of course the width and quantity of those elements is unknown to the developer: there may exist any number of elements (huge differences in quantity might lead to a change on the entire structure of the thing, out the point here), with unknown text contents, with an unknown font with whatever size and style.\n\nAnd talking about right now: how can that be done using only CSS, without JavaScript? I don't know if CSS calculations use JavaScript to begin with, but in case they do, well, I guess you know what I'm talking about, and things like \"calc()\" would be acceptable, just to make it clear.",

If it's more than 2-3 times a year, it's almost better to have the CMS because you can update the site from your phone anywhere in the world at the drop of a hat. WP at this point takes less than 1 hour to finish a generic brochure style site. If you are never going to update it, then sure just going full static makes more sense.",
