I wanted it to be firstNamelastName.com.\n\nBut that's already taken.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen I saw **.design.**\n\nI thought it was fitting given the nature of the site, but I've never heard of any .design sites before and I'm afraid it's going to impact visibility and word-of-mouth referrals.\n\nIs this a concern? Should I just go for .net, which is available?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks",
