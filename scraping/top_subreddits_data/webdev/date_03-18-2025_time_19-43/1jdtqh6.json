If that field is filled in it's a bot.\n2. When the user requests the page add a HTTP-only cookie with a UNIX timestamp. It'll get sent along with the contact submission. If the submission is within a certain time I don't send it forward.\n3. Anything caught by the endpoint gets a proper 200 status returned. No reason to let people know.\n\nThat's enough for anything scripted that's just scraping the web for things to spam. If you want to protect yourself from a dedicated spammer you need to log their device somehow and do submission timeouts and all that jazz.\n\nStart with the above and then move on to something beefier if it becomes an issue.",
