            "body": "Great initiative to centralize these questions! Starting a web dev career can feel overwhelming, but having resources in one place makes it way easier to navigate.\n\nOn top of the essentials you mentioned, I\u2019d suggest diving deep into JavaScript since it's the backbone of many modern web applications. Understanding async programming with Promises and async/await can be a game-changer. Also, if you\u2019re looking into front-end frameworks, React\u2019s hooks are particularly important to grasp for managing state and side-effects in your components.\n\nCreating a live project can solidify what you learn. Try building a simple CRUD app using an API; it\u2019s a great way to showcase your skills and understand how everything connects in a full stack situation. Plus, it gives you something tangible for your portfolio.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about responsive design principles with CSS! Tools like Flexbox and Grid can really elevate your projects and make them stand out.\n\nLastly, networking is crucial. Engaging in communities like this and contributing to open source projects can help you gain insights and feedback. Keep pushing through those learning curves; it really pays off in the end!",

A long time ago in college I was in a CS program and learning Rails off of the DHH tutorial. To make a long story short, I ended up working in IT/technical support, but now things have looped back around to the point where it would be useful for me in my current role to pick Rails back up again.\n\nIs there a particular tutorial that people recommend these days for getting started with Ruby/Rails that's not a paid course? I have access to Linkedin Learning through my job, but I took a look through there the other day and was kind of skeptical of the value of a lot of that content. \n\nOn top of that, I'd also like to try and formalize my knowledge of JS - I write little things to automate annoying tasks for my team semi-regularly but anything new that I make usually starts with a few minutes on Google trying to remember what's probably basic stuff for other people (e.g. iterating keys/values in a JS object).

Do you have a Udemy course you'd recommend for someone who already has their feet wet? I'd like to avoid spending money listening to someone explain what a string is.",

To my knowledge, these courses are usually semi-directed, where an instructor teaches different forms and techniques, but mostly assists students with whatever they're working on, giving guidance and support. The benefit of all this is that, if a student is already quite skilled, they don't need to \"start from scratch\" by attending classes that teach the basics, and can just jump straight into working on projects at their level of expertise.\n\nIs anyone aware of any such courses for webdev/software portfolios, either online or in-person? I feel like my time would be wasted in the \"fixed curriculum\" format of a traditional college/university course, given my level of experience (3 years webdev + 1 year teaching), but I would gladly pay money for the guidance and direction of a knowledgable teacher/mentor to help me build out a better portfolio.",
