    "selftext": "I want to switch from Chrome to FireFox not only as my primary browser but also as my preferred dev browser primarily because of Chrome's plan to block installation of uBlockOrigin. I've found the modern web to be virtually unusable without some form of ad blocker and uBO is the only non-half-baked solution I'm aware of.\n\nHas anyone else switched because of this? If not this, then what made you switch?\n\nWhat have been some major differences you noticed?\n\nWhat has the learning curve been like?\n\nHow long did it take you to forget that you used to use Chrome?",

            "body": "Firefox all the way.  Containers alone make it better than all the other options for a consultant like me that might have two projects with the same tooling (GitHub, outlook, figma, etc). Also, Firefox recovers from crashes without nearly the same chaos as chrome if you are like me and keep you to-do list as open tabs. \n\nPlus being able to use the mobile app and send tabs from device to device is also nice.  \n\nFYSA:  containers are not the same as spaces or workspaces in other browsers.  They segregate memory space and cookies, etc so it is like using two different browsers.  I haven't found another browser that will let me log into Outlook under two accounts within the same browser. Containers allowed me to do that side by side without any bleed over of sessions or data.\n\nEdited for typos (Firefox doesn't help with that)",

Maybe i just need to fiddle with it more. Profiling tools do seem better on firefox though\n- Occasionally i try to load a url on firefox mobile and it just randomly doesn't load anything. I have to fully close out the browser and restart it to get it working.\n\nSo in short, it's usable, but not exactly a smooth experience for me.

Hell, it was (is?) faster and more intuitive. Great UI and for devs some pretty fancy stuff. Blew Firebug and the derivative tools right out of the water. Yeah, I switched.
