    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI often use classless frameworks like water.css for prototypes but wanted some with a slightly different look.\n\nI'm excited to share **Classless.css**, a new zero-configuration, drop-in CSS framework that instantly transforms plain HTML into a modern design without requiring a single class in your markup: [https://digitallytailored.github.io/Classless.css/](https://digitallytailored.github.io/Classless.css/)\n\n# Why Classless.css is different from other frameworks\n\nUnlike traditional CSS frameworks that require you to add utility classes, Classless.css works by automatically by targeting semantic HTML elements:\n\n* Just drop it in - link the CSS file and watch your plain HTML transform\n* Zero classes needed in your markup - keep your HTML clean and semantic (though there are a few helper classess for common things like danger buttons)\n* Modern, polished aesthetic with minimal effort and dark mode support\n\n# Perfect Use Cases\n\nClassless.css is ideal for:\n\n* Rapid prototyping when you need something that looks good instantly\n* Content-focused websites where you want to focus on writing, not styling\n* Blogs and documentation sites that prioritize readability\n* Small projects where you don't need the overhead of a full CSS framework\n\nSimply drop it in, write semantic HTML, and you're done! Would love to hear your thoughts or see what you build with it.",
