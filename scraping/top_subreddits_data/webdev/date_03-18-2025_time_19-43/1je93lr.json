    "selftext": "Hello Anons,\n\nI've just launched the MVP of a video-sharing and hosting platform \u2014\u00a0[saketmanolkar.me](https://saketmanolkar.me/). I'd appreciate it if you check it out and share any feedback \u2014 criticism is more than welcome.\n\nThe platform has all the essential social features, including user follow/unfollow, video likes, comments, and a robust data tracking and analytics system.  \n**Note:**\u00a0The front end is built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, so it's not fully mobile-responsive yet. For the best experience, please use a laptop.\n\n# Tech Stack & Infrastructure:\n\n* **Backend:**\u00a0Python with the Django framework.\n* **Cloud Hosting:**\u00a0DigitalOcean\n* **Database:**\u00a0Managed PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching and as a Celery message broker.\n* **Deployment:**\u00a0GitHub repo deployed on the DigitalOcean App Platform with a 2 GB RAM web server and a 2 GB RAM Celery worker.\n* **Media Storage:**\u00a0DigitalOcean Spaces (with CDN) for serving static assets, videos, and thumbnails.\n\n# Key Features:\n\n* Instant AI-generated data analysis reports with text-to-speech (TTS) functionality.\n* An AI-powered movie recommendation system.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts. Thank you.",

I believe this data and its analysis should be democratized. Instead of overwhelming creators with graphs, they should be provided (or spoonfed) with clear, actionable insights and strategies to improve their art and make better business decisions.",

I'm sure you're using some kind of intelligent queueing system but I'm curious have you load tested it  to see what kind of volume you can handle in a reasonable amount of time? What happens if a hundred people are uploading video at the same time ?\n\nJust curious, nice work on the project I look forward to properly running through it when back on PC.",

                    "body": "Thank you for the compliment!\n\nActually yes, 2 gb is kinda slim, I am working with resource constraints. I have put the entire video processing pipeline in task queuing to minimize the load on the server but As of right now I don't have any proper resource management system for video processing.\n\nBut i do have a global redis locking system on the text-to-speech functionality to prevent concurrent request processing. So i plan to use the same system on video processing too . \n\nThank you for checking out my site!",
