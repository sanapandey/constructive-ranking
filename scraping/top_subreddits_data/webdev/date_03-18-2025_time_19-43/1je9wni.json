    "selftext": "I was self-taught for a while, mainly learning the MERN stack, before going to college, where I picked up ASPNET (C#), Spring Boot (Java), Angular, SQL (MSSQL & MySQL), and potentially Android development (or sticking with React Native). I won't be looking for official work with mobile as it would just be mostly for freelance work. I also have a mechanical engineering degree and will finish college this year.\n\nFor robotics, my go-to language is Python. I\u2019ve structured my learning with a monthly revision plan and have a solid grasp of all the languages I use. Given my background and goals, am I being overambitious trying to balance full-stack, mobile, and robotics? Would love to hear from others who have tried a similar path!",

You need to find opportunities that allow you to practice all these disciplines. Follow the stuff your good at.",
