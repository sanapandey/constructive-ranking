    "selftext": "A wave of twitter link bans is sweeping across reddit.  \n\n\nWe /r/Persona5 mods try to be pretty hands off when possible. This subreddit is about an old video game, and we welcome political discussion here about as much as we welcome flies on food. But the controversy surrounding Musk has become loud enough that a lot of similarly politics-free gaming subreddits have decided to blanket ban links to Twitter. Rather than just making a decision, we felt we should ask the subreddit. While rules on basic politeness and respect between users will be strictly enforced, in this one post you may discuss politics surrounding the reasons to ban or not ban Twitter links.  \n\n\nIf the ban side wins, screenshots of twitter posts will still be allowed, but no direct links.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1i8fbi4)",

Thus, that gives the artist new incentive to post to Pixiv, as they can only benefit from the natural functions of the internet via using a different site. Nothing that is posted here cannot be posted to Pixiv. Porn is not allowed here. Thus, anyone who is not posting to Pixiv is doing it to themselves, as they *could* do that and get sourced.\n\nThink of it like boycotting a distributor, thus driving profits to those who rely on that distribute down. Like, if coffee shop was getting slave-grown coffee from a distributor and people protested anyone selling beans sourced from that distributor, the coffee shop could switch who they get their beans from and not be boycotted. They could escape the boycott\u2019s impacts at any time by just switching distributors.

Since this is a fan sub, using it to push a political statement is ill-advised.\n\n\nWhy not make a statement against child-trafficing instead? Because it's not trending in other communities?\n\n\nIf you asked the community if we should encourage more anti-Trump threads that have nothing to do with Persona, you might find a surprising number of people who vote yes - you might even get a majority. Do we actually want that? No, we have plenty of subs for that already.\n\n\nDon't cause a rift in the community to conform to internet outrage. Running a successful sub is a privilege and using it to push ideologies is an abuse of said privilege, even if the ideologies are right or good.",
