(Yakuza 3, currently playing Yakuza 4 but like I just started so idk who the villain is)\n\nSpecifically ||Mine Yoshitaka, chairman of the Hakuho Clan, a Tojo Clan Subsidiary.||\n\nI'm thinking his palace would be a shrine. While he is similar to Kaneshiro at first, I think they actually view money in very different ways. One views money negatively, while he has amassed a lot of it, he just sees it as something people want out of him, while Kaneshiro is obsessed with collecting more and more, while ||Mine|| has already climbed to the top and is almost bored of money. His philosophy of only looking out for yourself, and that any sort of help to others is bad, to the point he calls people who receive help and rely on others victims would be very interesting compared to the Phantom Thieves, who work as a group and gain strength directly through relying on each other.\n\nI think as well the overall puzzle of the dungeon could revolve around breaking down his emotional barriers, and exploring his relationship with the Tojo Clan and Yakuza as a whole. I think his dungeon could be very interesting if it had two alternate paths that you could complete. One path where you have to go alone, and another where you go as a group. Or options where in order to proceed you have to cut off party members, either removing thieves from outside your lineup so you can't swap, or making your party dwindle from 4 to 3 to 2 to just Joker, having to become more independent as you advance, with the option of instead taking massive penalties to keep your party.\n\n||Mine's|| whole deal is that he wanted to join the yakuza to see if these bonds of brotherhood and bonds between men were real, so I think generally his puzzles testing that, if you would abandon your allies or suffer along side them could be fun. Another unique mechanic could be pooling the party's health, so that all of you have one large health pool. So instead of one party member getting knocked out, the group's collective health is lowered. So any death is a total party wipe.\n\nI think he'd be an interesting character, and exploring his relationship with Daigo would be interesting as well. I think ultimately his treasure would be Daigo, or something symbolizing Daigo. The big reveal of his dungeon being that what at first seems to be a shrine to money and power, to his rise to the top of the Tojo Clan, is actually a shrine to Daigo.",

            "body": "Shadow Fight 3's The Stranger. \nTbh, I can't see him getting a change of heart for a couple reasons. First, The Stranger is one of many versions of Shadow's Descendant, a child that never got to live beyond their birth. He, specifically, is the one with the worst possible traits that the Descendant could have combined, but that isn't actually the reason why I think him having a change of heart wouldn't work. \n\nIt's because he is the Shadow World.  \n\nBasically, in Shadow Fight 2, there's a separate plane called the Shadow World, one that by the end of the game, Shadow (SF2's main character) destroys. The destruction of the plane, however, brings about the Sphere, an object that contains Shadow Mind, all the power of the Shadow World condensed into a living being. It bonds (imagine Venom) with May (Shadow's wife at the time) while she is pregnant. She has the child, it brings with it a surge of shadow energy, Shadow (the guy) has to kill the kid and May, but can't kill Shadow Mind before it escapes. \n\nThe Stranger, is the version of the Descendant that contains the Shadow World, and I think that this means the he isn't actually a singe entity, but rather the will of that world trying to exist again, solidified into a person of dubius morality and incredible power.\n\nBUUUUUUUUUUT, I wouldn't go to say that he wouldn't have a palace, and that's where we're getting into now.\n\nI see his palace as a distorted version of the Shadow World, where the little places where life were, were overrun by shadow energy and destruction. The main gimmick of the palace would be shadow energy. You would get shadow energy by destroying orbs or fighting enemies, wich would still be called shadows, but are actually fragments of Shadow Mind and as such, can't be recruited. When you have shadow energy, your eyes turn a dark shade of blue, and your clothes start having blue \"veins\" of shadow energy, with the more shadow energy you have the longer and more pronounced the veins are, going from the bottom of the coat up until the neck. You can enter the \"inside\" of the shadow world by hinding into specifics spots in the map that also have veins, but only when you have shadow energy, and the more shadow energy you have the more time you can spend there. From here, I can see a bunch of different puzzles, just not timed ones, I don't like that those would have to rely on enemies if you already got the orbs.\n\nFor mini bosses, I would use distorted versions of the Demons. The main bosses of SF2 that follow the Stranger after his rise to power in SF3, that are originated from the Shadow World, excluding May who: 1) Isn't a demon anymore. And 2) the Stranger genuinely values. The boss of the Palace would be separated in two phases. The first one is Titan, the final boss and villain of SF2. The original, tyrannical ruler of the Shadow World who planned to rule all other worlds, is now merely a stand-in for the Stranger's shadow, having his empty white eyes replaced by pure yellow ones. After defeating him, however, the Stranger himself would appear, denying even having a shadow and claming the Titan is just a defence mechanism. \"I am what I am. What I am not, someone else is\" he would then morph Shadow Mind into another form, claiming it to be his Persona. Qin Shin Huang. The second phase starts.\n\nIf y'all think that he would actually have a chnage of heart, or not, I could see both, even after putting my arguments as for why I don't think he would. Mostly because he is still a person, embodiment of a world and all that included. Sorry for the long comment, hope I cooked.",
