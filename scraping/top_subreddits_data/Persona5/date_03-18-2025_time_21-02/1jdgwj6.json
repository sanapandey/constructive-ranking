Also, since you need to rank her up 5 times in that span of time (no idea the fastest it can be done), it gives you less time for 'spent alone time with'\n\nAgain, cause I can't stress it enough, it doesn't matter if yusuke isn't an option",

All the Christmas romance items do anyway is slightly boost confidant rank xp *for that specific confidant*, which is not only not a problem because it\u2019s super easy to get sufficient xp for the next rank-up during the confidant episodes themselves (you can also boost this further by equipping a Persona of the same Arcana), and her confidant is split in half between the third semester and the rest of the game, so a romance item for Yoshizawa would be of highly limited utility anyways.",

What would his motivation for the mental shutdowns even be then? Maybe shido killed their father? But even then, why help shido. The whole reason why he helped shido in the release version is the fact that he had no way of getting back at him otherwise. Cuz he had nothing. No family, no money, no influence, no friends, no one to even talk to, nothing. I think akechi definitely got changed for the better, lol. Early version akechi sounds like a pure villain ngl.",

You need to be 18 to be a legal guardian, so even assuming she passed her exam to be a prosecutor almost instantly, it's safe to assume she is a minimum of 20-21. Nowadays it takes longer, but when P5 came out you could manage a law degree in Japan in 3 years, possibly even 2 if you already had prior requisite knowledge (which Sae easily could have considering we're told she was practically an honour student). For quite a long time, you didn't actually even need a degree to take the bar exam in Japan, you could take it right out of high school and if you, by a miracle, passed at that point, just one year of legal apprenticeship later and you could work as a lawyer. This exact scenario is seen in P2. I think that's been changed now, though, before P5 came out. Even still, I'd say 10 years is on the high end of an estimate. 28 isn't really \"young\" anymore, biologically speaking, 30 is \"old\". It's more likely that Sae is around 5 or 6 years older than Joker, probably like 22-23, 25 years max. Whilst Joker is technically underage, the age gap isn't *too* problematic if you ignore the fact he's a student, though it's still pretty damn dodgy imo. The real problem with this would be the fact she's actively working his case, so there's a power dynamic issue, but also a conflict of interest issue, and, as you've rightly pointed out, the fact she works in the justice system and is constantly under intense scrutiny by her boss, given what we know of Sae it would be hugely out of character for her to risk her career by fucking around with an underage Joker.",
