As a reminder, here are our spoiler rules:\n\nDo not include spoilers in the title. All submissions which involve spoilers should be marked. Spoilers include all story content for the first three weeks after release.\n\nSpoilers can be discussed in spoiler-flaired posts, but must be hidden in non-spoiler flaired posts. \n\nIf you think you broke the spoiler rules in the post you just made, you should remove your post now and repost it without \nbreaking the rules. If you do not remove your post and it needs to be reviewed, you will be given up to a week ban \nfor a first infraction and stricter punishments for any additional infractions. Please be considerate of your fellow Trailblazers and do not include spoilers in the \ntitle of your post. Do not forget to flair your post as spoilers if needed, and do not spoil people in your comments.\n\n**All posts with the Discussion, Theory and Lore, and Media flairs are automatically flagged spoilers for the first 3 weeks of this patch. Please remove the Spoiler flag if \nyour post does not relate to the new patch.**\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
