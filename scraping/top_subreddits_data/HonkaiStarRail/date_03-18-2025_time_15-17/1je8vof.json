Please be considerate of your fellow Trailblazers and do not include spoilers in the \ntitle of your post. Do not forget to flair your post as spoilers if needed, and do not spoil people in your comments.\n\n**All posts with the Discussion, Theory and Lore, and Media flairs are automatically flagged spoilers for the first 3 weeks of this patch.
