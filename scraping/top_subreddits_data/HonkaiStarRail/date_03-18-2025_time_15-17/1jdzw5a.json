I normally take my potentially good pieces to +9 before tagging them as discarded.\n\n\nThe XP should be the same if you feed them directly or dismantle them first, but upgraded relics lose some of the xp when recycled.\n\n\nFor the less obvious ones, I tend to do the following:\n- Hard-to-get main stats with desirable substats off-set: always keep, unless I already have a few of the same. Speed boots, crit bodies, err ropes...\n- Off-set, good substats: keep 1 or 2.\n- On-set, good piece with main stat not utilised by anyone yet: keep 1 or 2.\n\n\nBasically, I just keep 1 or 2 of the ones I can see being useful, but I don't hoard them.\n\n\nAnd don't sweat it too much, this is something a lot of us still struggle or have struggled with, and there isn't really a right answer, so just do whatever works for you.",

Sometimes i just keep it, again as you said it depends on how much of those peaces i already have. \nAnother annoying thing that cuz there so much sets. You build decent build, for example i finished my aventurine. \nAnd like 3 peaces are ones i would like to upgrade in the future , so i mark that in my exel sheet. But if i will focus on another  unit, i will never get those sets untill i farm same set for another unit, which is bit annoying. As i would like to finish off my units as decent as i can, but i also want ti build other units. \nAnd when there is so many team archetypes if you want to have few of diferent teams. You most likely be left with half baked units ( my case ) or you just deal with the idea that you will come back to those one day. Or you stuck building them for a long time and cant move to other ones.",

There are some exceptions, mainly DoT (Damage over Time) teams where other DoT characters function as support characters, FUA (Follow-Up Attack) based teams where Topaz, HM7, or Moze function as supporters, and Big Herta where erudition characters function as support characters, plus this does not apply to Calyxes and Pure Fiction.\n* You need a 'sustain' (preservation or abundance character who's job is to keep the team alive) for most more challenging content. If needed, two sustains can be used, but that can make things worse and should not be your default team. Again this does not apply to farming.\n* Pay attention to what your characters want/need. This starts with properly reading all the abilities including major traces. Dr. Ratio for example requires three debuffs on the target to fully function, so don't put him in a team where no one applies any. Not every minor part of a character must be at 100% efficiency (like Sparkle's attack buff for quantum characters). But if your character deals 60% more damage with two nihility teammates, you shouldn't ignore that.\n* A subsection of the above bullet point, plan the SP consumption and production. A big reason why multiple damage dealers is often bad is that you can't have everyone spend a skill point every turn, and most damage dealers have to do that to function.\n* Don't overrate damage types. Under most circumstances, the damage type of supports and sustains is irrelevant. For damage dealers outside of break teams, not matching the enemies' weakness is \\~25-30% less damage, so while you should try to match damage dealers to weaknesses, a good limited off-type damage dealer will still out-damage a weak on-type one.",

You'll be much better off with Feixiao+Aventurine+Robin+Topaz (FART team), or you could swap Topaz with Hunt March or Moze, but FART is the meta team\n\nAcheron wants 2 Nihility on her team unless she's E2. DoTcheron (Acheron+Kafka+Black Swan) is a thing but it's just not as strong as a hypercarry Acheron comp. You'd probably be better off running her with Pela and another Nihility- try with Black Swan as she's got more useful debuffs, or even Guinaifen. I will say that Acheron is a bit on the weaker side without at least S1 but she'll still be able to clear\n\nYou could also run the traditional DoT comp (Kafka+Black Swan+Robin+Huohuo), but that removes Robin from your best team and probably isn't worth it most of the time\n\nJingliu+Bronya+Ruan Mei is a good core that works well enough into Ice-weak content. It's fallen off a bit but it'll still do fine. You probably want Huohuo in the last slot if Bronya is E1S1 and you can afford the extra SP, otherwise Bailu or another SP generator will do fine\n\nRappa+Ruan Mei+HMC will work great mainly into Imaginary-weak content. You won't get the same performance without Fugue but again, this will clear fine.\n\nDr. Ratio's best comp is the Feixiao one (Ratio+Topaz+Robin+Aventurine), but he still does fine without his best supports. You can use units like Pela/Guinaifen/Moze to get his debuffs, though I'm not sure what the eidolon requirements are for the 4-star units. He's not as strong without Robin but again, the comp should be fine to clear the content.\n\nDon't neglect your 4\\* supports. Tingyun is extremely useful in many of your possible comps (Clara, Ratio, Seele, Jingliu), and Pela is ol' reliable for just about anything. Gallagher is one of the best healers in the game. Lynx has synergy with Clara but I probably wouldn't recommend it at this point\n\nI would seriously consider looking into character guides and Prydwen to get a feel for what each character needs and what works best",

                    "body": "You do have great characters and can make great teams. Swarm/Gold and Gears is quite difficult on the hardest levels, more difficult than endgame IMO, but that's not true for the easiest difficulties. As a day 1 player, your teams should be able to handle it. I'd suggest checking your builds. You don't want to just throw on the recommended relics and get them to level 15. You need to get the right main stat and good substats. Prydwen and Guoba Certified on YouTube both have stat number suggestions. You don't have to be at the stats they suggest for every stat, but being as close as possible is what the goal is. This is how I've built my characters and I've been full clearing endgame since 1.3 and have done basically everything possible in Swarm/G&G (except some ridiculously hard achievements that are completely RNG, those are annoying). \n\nYou also want to make sure to select blessings and curios that benefit whatever team you're using. For example, Acheron may be a nihility character, but the nihility blessings don't benefit her as much because those are DoT oriented and she's not a DoT character. She prefers erudition blessings overall, but she can use some hunt blessings too. If you use Firefly or Rappa, they'll want the destruction blessings because those are the better options for break characters. \n\nI'd use a 2.x/3.x current meta team, because those dpses are overall stronger than the 1.x options. In other words, go for a The Herta or Rappa or Firefly or Feixiao or Acheron team. I generally prefer using Acheron in these modes nowadays because she can save time with using her auto-kill technique in the combat domains, plus she's strong. But the other options are great too. You will likely struggle with Fu Xuan in these modes, so just use Huohuo or Gallagher.",
