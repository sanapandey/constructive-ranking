This also adds a sensible approximation to a god of war/conflicts/strife to the character's name (ten thousand enemies)",

I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just use his name when it exists but, you argue the same for English. Why didn\u2019t they call him Mydeimos, but Mydei instead? Well, I have no idea.\n\nAll the other Amphoreus character names are also translated either phonetically, or they have their own Chinese names:\n\nAglaea: \u963f\u683c\u83b1\u4e9a (a ge lai ya)\n\nTribbie/Trinon/Trianne/Tribios: \u7f07\u5b9d/\u7f07\u5b81/\u7f07\u5b89/\u7f07\u91cc\u897f\u5e87\u4fc4\u65af (ti bao/ti ning/ti an/ti li xi bi e si)\n\nPhainon: \u767d\u5384 (bai e; I do not know the reason for this name, but if translated literally, it means \u201cWhite Disaster\u201d)\n\nCastorice: \u9050\u789f (xia die; same as Phainon, I don\u2019t know what it represents, but literal meaning is \u201cReverie Butterfly\u201d)\n\nAnaxa/Anaxagoras: \u90a3\u523b\u590f/\u963f\u90a3\u514b\u8428\u6208\u62c9\u65af (na ke xia/a na ke sa ge la si)\n\n**Sorry if I missed any**\n\nSome non-Amphoreus names such as Acheron:\n\nAcheron is the name of a river in Greek mythology, it is known as the \u201criver of woe\u201d (from Wikipedia)\n\nIn Chinese, her name is \u9ec4\u6cc9. It is the name of a river in Chinese culture. It is said to be the name of the river of the dead. Its literal meaning is \u201cyellow spring\u201d, referring to the Yellow River of China.\n\nTopaz: \u6258\u5e15 \n\nTopaz\u2019s Chinese name is a good example of a phonetic translation, even though the word \u201cTopaz\u201d already exists in Chinese: \u9ec4\u7389 (yellow jade). They call her \u201ctuo pa\u201d because it\u2019s the closest sounding words to \u201cTopaz\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a two way street, I fail to see how any of this is disrespectful?",

I know his name was an emperor's title. \n\nOr even someone like Zhongli. What if he was called Johnny by non Chinese people? He is quite literally the personification of ancient China in the world of GI. Had he been stripped off his name to appease to the masses because they find his name too foreign or too unrelatable or even strange to pronounce, I'd find it disrespectful as well. \n\nAmphoreus' design is straight out of the Hellenic world. They were inspired, or simply took, parts of a culture and created something with it profiting off of it. That's fine. History and cultures inspire.\n\nI just think they shouldn't be adjusting and tailoring names of other cultures to fit their own as they don't do this for the EN/JP version when it comes to their own culture represented by Luofu.",

Belobog names are all phonetically translated in CN, Penacony names are phonetic based on who they are:\n\nAcheron is as mentioned before, her CN name uses a Chinese river\u2019s name instead.\n\nGallagher is phonetically translated as \u52a0\u62c9\u8d6b (jia la he)\n\nRobin isn\u2019t, and neither is Sunday, but both Robin\u2019s name and Sunday\u2019s name in CN is just the Mandarin word for Robin and Sunday as \u77e5\u66f4\u9e1f/\u661f\u671f\u65e5\n\nSome other examples are how Boothill is translated different in other languages. His CN name is just the phonetic translation of his English name, but his French name is completely different.\n\nOr Fugue, her English name has nothing to do with her CN name. Fugue is a type of memory loss sort-of thing which fits her story, hence why her EN name is Fugue. If we wanted it to be accurate, her name would be Wangguiren. \n\nSilver Wolf\u2019s is a literal translation: \u94f6\u72fc \u201cSilver Wolf\u201d.\n\nHeck, your example of \u201cXianzhou is accurate\u201d is only partially correct. The whole Viyadhara clans aren\u2019t even translated \u201caccurately\u201d into English. They use Latin names for the Viyadhara titles like \u201cImbibitor Lunae\u201d. The accurate translation would be \u996e\u6708\u541b \u201cYinyuejun\u201d.\n\nThat goes for the Xianzhou Generals too. Jing Yuan\u2019s title in CN vs EN isn\u2019t even the same thing. But the localisation team took some creative liberties to make it easier to understand *and* pronounce. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing.\n\nI honestly feel you are taking this too seriously. They aren\u2019t mocking/ridiculing these names just because they take some creative liberties and change them into something more understandable/localised. Phainon\u2019s name and Castorice\u2019s name would have no meaning if translated phonetically, but by giving them localised names, they are able to give it an extra/alternative layer of meaning for their Chinese player base that doesn\u2019t outright mislead/misinform them.\n\nAnd also, Amphoreus\u2019s names are also mixed. Cities like Okhema and Janusopolis are phonetically translated (\u5965\u8d6b\u739b ao he ma/\u96c5\u52aa\u8428\u6ce2\u5229\u65af ya nu sa bo li si), whereas Castrum Kremos and Grove of Epiphany have localised names (\u60ac\u5cf0\u57ce xuan feng cheng \u201cHanging Sword City\u201d/\u795e\u609f\u6811\u5ead shen wu shu ting \u201cTree Courtyard of Divine Epiphany\u201d). It is literally impossible to phonetically translate Castrum Kremnos and Grove of Epiphany into CN without it sounding too long and weird.\n\nYet, all the Titan\u2019s names are phonetically translated, using their \u201csort-of\u201d Greek sounding names, for example:\n\nKephale: \u523b\u6cd5\u52d2 ke fa le\n\nCerces: \u745f\u5e0c\u65af se xi si\n\nNikador: \u5c3c\u5361\u591a\u5229 ni ka duo li",

So all languages will prioritise CN meaning for luofu characters, JP meaning for inazuma (genshin) characters, etc \n\nEN localises luofu names with just their hanyupinyin equivalent (ie \u666f\u5143-Jingyuan), and all the other eastern languages just use their equivalent (JP uses kanji but pronounces it the japanese way). Same goes for the belebog characters, Geppard is just '\u6770\u5e15\u5fb7-jie pa de' \n\nBut for some later regions and characters, like fyxestroll garden and tingyun-fugue were localised in english to have an additional meaning within english. \n\n* Fyxestroll (\u7ee5\u56ed) is a portmanteau of 'fyxen' (fox) and 'stroll', because the garden was made by foxians, but the original CN refers to it being a 'pacifying/peaceful court', alluding to it's ghostly nature\n\n* Tingyun-fugue (\u5fd8\u5f52\u4eba, wang gui ren). In CN it means she's a person who has forgotten home. In EN fugue is used instead, to reference her non-lucid state, and to provide some minor semblance to the CN name (fugue-wanggui)\n\nMost of the other amphoreus characters are localised in CN too, one example being Tribbie (\u7f07\u5b9d tiebao, 'orange-red treasure'), forgoing the original meaning of 'three life - tri bios', focusing on the fragility and preciousness of the character (red gemstone, dying chrysos heir, etc)\n\n* side note, \u5b9d can also colloquially be used to describe infants, as in '\u5b9d\u5b9d' (\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7684\u5c0f\u5b9d\u5b9d). Repeating characters tend to add additional emphasis to the thing being described, and children in this context are extremely precious\n\nbut some they chose to just transliterate instead, like Aglaea(\u963f\u683c\u83b1\u96c5)- 'a ge lai ya', Chartonus(\u54c8\u6258\u52aa\u65af) - 'ha tuo nu si'. The words individually may have some minor semantic meaning, but the entire name doesnt have any real meaning besides sounding like the EN name",

Im sure the creatives run into some of this incidental concepts as they work on the project, and just inject meaning into the characters as they come.

HOLY SHIT.)...\n\n...and then you get him in battle, and he just spends the entire battle punching the floor with some magical astrology crystals and you don't even get to control him.\n\nHe doesn't even look like he's the Demigod of Strife. You don't see the Lance of Fury. You don't see him summoning spears and weapons and shit. You don't hear that \"bloodlust\" sound that Nikador made us hear when we approached him in the story.\n\nI am so fucking pissed they put so little effort into making the actual game part of Mydei even half as much a success as his character. He's by far my favourite character in the entire game by a wide margin and I won't even be pulling for him I'm that disappointed.",

Although sometimes Tamamo Cat mutters words with implications that can surprise the surrounding people.\n\n\n6) However he is not mindless outside of battle and fun fact, While possessing an affinity with the\u00a0Lancer and\u00a0Rider classes as well as the\u00a0Berserker class, he is invariably affected by Mad Enhancement, regardless of the class he is summoned in, curiously enough.\n\n\n7) Despite being a berserker, during the fight Lancelot retains some strategical instincts.
