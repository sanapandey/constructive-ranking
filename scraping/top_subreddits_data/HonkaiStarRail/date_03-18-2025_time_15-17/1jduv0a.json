Obviously the story doesnt linger there, its the tutorial area. But the Stellaron Hunter plot thread is still ongoing and slowly revealed. I think people forget we didnt even know that they followed the Finality until 2.3, and we didnt even get \"official\" confirmation that MC was a stellaron hunter until 3.0. Like this an ongoing story lol, we still dont even know what the SH plan to drop MC to become a trailblazer was or why they need a stellaron inside of them.\n\nI dont think they need to rush the story to show some kind of punishment for the \"bad guys\" on screen lmao.",

It's no use of responding to you personally because you have tendency of twisting words of your opponents, so my words will be for the others that share your opinion.\n\nA few vague lines of dialogue (vague because to this day some argue that SW didn't attract the legion) in the start of the game and this topic never touched upon to this day. Never, despite the destruction and the victims they inflicted. Because apparently, no one but SH knows that it's their doing, very convenient.\n\nJust like, very conveniently, the drug RM feed to mc removed any memories of her crimes. Before mc treating all that RM make them to go through like a walk in the park\n\nAventurine was threatening to trigger the Stellaron? That was just a bluff and it's resolved off-screen, because mc is fine with accepting his gifts shortly after. No big deal.\n\nSparkle? She always was a red herring! Doesn't matter that Sampo said she's taking it too far with her jokes.\n\nAglea was about to kill mc and DH? Nah, that was just her plan. Mc is holding no grudges shortly after.\n\nIf you have faith that Hoyo will not forget SH killing researches, cool. I don't, because there were not a single precedent when 5* \"morally gray\" character faced any kind of lasting consequences or their actions were perceived as \"really bad\" or \"unforgivable\" by the narrative. Even Sunday is free to go with the Express.\n\nYou can wait for the story to finally have stakes and conflict between playable characters or just accept that Hoyo don't like taking risks and showing bad guys they want to sell in a bad light",

Seems I left an impact so maybe I should apologize for whatever debate we had? \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOk so here's the thing I really dont want to debate you point by point so I'll just say this. It's fiction. Morally dubious characters are interesting. \n\nI'm not saying that they'll suddenly bring back the unnamed dead scientists from the first hour of the game, capture Kafka and Silverwolf, and give them 50 spankings per casualty. I'm saying that we'll probably eventually learn more about their motivations and the reason why they considered those casualties necessary to put MC in Herta space station with the stellaron and have them join the Express. Is their goal the greater good? Is it related to them following the Finality? Is it related to bringing down Nanook? That kinda stuff. Because thats interesting, not having them be punished for morally bad actions.\n\nI think most of the examples you listed there arent really related to this topic. They seem to be... another whole discourse about stakes in the story. The one that does seem related to me is your mention of Sunday. That's a perfect example. I personally find what we got for him to be significantly more interesting than \"he's a bad guy, he's morally wrong, so his story ends with him being jailed\". Like... sure, morally maybe the best would be for him to stay jailed (or some other punishment) like he was after 2.2. But that doesnt make for an interesting story. Him joining the main cast after confronting his ideals, with a new goal in mind after saying farewell to his sister? Yeah thats more interesting. It's fiction, so why not?",

Not even a word of \"I recognize that you're broken, but we can't be friends\"\n\nSunday is the perfect example of this. He's joining the crew, that's a fixed point.

We know that he lied to the Intellegentsia Guild in relation to some construction material. Not any murder. \nHim killing his master was more a fact brought up in Jade and Aventurine's conversation (in fact, she expresses surprise at his daring at defying said norm, which was certainly a factor in her offering him a position at the IPC). I am not arguing that she is in any way a good person, in fact as a Jade fan I quite like her warped morality, since she's composed based on the concept of unfair, exploitative deals. But she states in her text messages how she dislikes coercion & that she thinks a deal requires (formal) consent from both parties. Which is why I dislike this bit of misinfo, since I feel it's quite contrary to her character and the kind of trade colonisation she embodies.",

Black Swan is my least favorite character and I couldnt give you a valid reason for it. I say this as someone who likes Jade. Its just undeniable shes more mysterious than others and seems more villainous because of her bonajade exchange which legit fucks people over. They\u2019re fictional characters and one group has been portrayed more positively (even if they are star terrorists in the narrative) while the other is apart of a faction that has been portrayed as very predatory. The writing has made people like the stellaron hunters more than the IPC currently. People can dislike that if you want a narrative reason, but sometimes the reason can be something silly too.\n\nI\u2019m sure that there are people who dislike her just because she talked down to both firefly and sunday (I know she didn\u2019t really but people could interpret it as that). The only problem that I agree with is if people are being insufferable that one is morally superior to the other, or falsely accusing Jade of being evil therefore a bad character. It sucks if people are interpreting her as evil therefore bad to like. It\u2019s just a reason that is wrong.\n\nIf this is what you mean then I agree with you that its a little hypocritical to dislike someone for being evil (when they\u2019re not even really that evil) and liking the stellaron hunters. It\u2019s kinda an incomplete reason. But if the reason is disliking them for being a corporate IPC member which takes advantage of planets and liking the stellaron hunters cuz they\u2019re cool in narrative, then it\u2019s chill imo. Like they both do bad things but one is very imperialist for planets and their leader has blown up planets and the other takes down bad factions and occasionally attacks the IPC (i know i downplayed their actions)\n\nAnd even then I don\u2019t blame the people who made the false interpretation of jade because she hasn\u2019t had that much narrative presence in the first place. Not much of anything to like anything. It only becomes a problem when they say they are morally superior for disliking jade imo",

I think every Stoneheart is gonna go through a portion of fandom backlash initially lol. We are 3 for 3 so far.

Twice has Obsidian expressed her desire for bloodshed and \"the fun of unnatural deaths\" and Opal displayed a very apathetic views on other's well-being during his meeting with Jade and Obsidian about the Silverchain Galaxy acquisition. And again, the brat who has his employees line up, offering him opal nibbler is one hell of a demonstration of arrogance. They both have been mentioned as good candidates for Penacony project, with Opal even being brought up by Aventurine's inner thought as someone who would have gotten everything done by the time Aventurine was busy with his false death. I guess you need someone that crazy to handle the similarly crazy members of Family, the folks than won't hesitate to throw an Emanator summoning at your face.\n\nAs for Belobog, there's only an IPC NPC mentioning how Topaz is the least terrible among his 11 Directors (so Diamond + 10 Stonehearts). Which is interesting because this implies Diamond or Pearl can be capable of something worse than what Topaz has shown, and Pearl has seemed plenty chill.",

She expresses that she's only good at what ought to be done to irredeemable villains, which implies she selects her targets.\n\nLike, we've seen SAM raid and destroy like... an IPC weapons lab (probably saving billions of innocent lives), support Kafka in taking down Japella Brotherhood (which is a subset of the Annihilation Gang) and...uh...sacrifice herself to try and take Sparkle's (fake) bomb away from a populated planet to save the civilians. For the most part, if we judge SAM solely by what we see of her, then she'd be a *hero*. She even looks the part with the futuristic Kamen Rider Fairy Knight aesthetic.\n\n\nJade, on the other hand, is...well, she's part of the IPC, which honestly kind of seem more villainous than the Stellaron Hunters at times. She runs a Faustian Bargain shop and does stuff *remove someone's ability to form meaningful bonds*, or *lobotomize a detective in pursuit of a criminal*. Certainly, the victims were made aware of the price and agreed to it, but it still reeks very much of preying upon the weak and desperate. You could say she was teaching the gambler a lesson, but the detective's only crime was wanting to ensure that the criminal didn't get away.\n\nAnd she does this *for shits and giggles*. She ruins people's lives for fun! She runs an orphanage, apparently, but that's never seen or mentioned, so we only see her as a ruthless business woman who has the *serpent of eden* in her animations along with stepping on people and whipping them.\n\n\nTL;DR: Firefly is ostensibly a villain*, but is very much portrayed and introduced as a good/heroic character. Jade is part of the IPC, and is portrayed as an evil/cruel/ruthless character.\n\n*According to like, the IPC and the Japella Brotherhood/Annihilation Gang",

Boothill could torture Oswaldo Schneider's entire family in front of him and I would think he was being kind. Same thing for Rappa and Dr. Primitive.\n\nWhile the SH are much more mysterious, the story heavily implies they are at least trying to fight for a good cause. But they are much more morally complex, because they cause so much harm in the process, making you think if all of it is worth it in the end.\n\nThen you have the IPC gang, who are awful for the sake of generating more profit to an organization already so profitable it controls entire chunks of the universe. I do not care that they have sad little backstories, I simply cannot empathize or sympathize with them because I see their actions as wrong and despicable for the sake of it. Unlike other morally dubious characters.\n\nIt really doesn't help that I dislike most of their designs too, so I really see no reason to pull for them. And, no I do not feel any seething hatred for any of these characters, they just don't cross my mind most of the time.

I can\u2019t make a concrete opinion on since I don\u2019t have enough information but I think she\u2019s okay. Firefly? I don\u2019t really like at all and I dislike the way she was handled during Penacony, people are too attached to her as a waifu and are obnoxious about it. Kafka? I like Kafka the most because of the mystery and intrigue about her, I think our mysterious tie to Kafka specifically is something that keeps me interested as well and I\u2019d like to know more about her lore wise in game. Comparing the worst character of the IPC so far with the SH doesn\u2019t make sense to me, crimes are crimes is such a oversight on the nuance and differences of these factions.",

It's not really a maybe, its just what it is. Thats why most fans of hers like myself were captivated by the rooftop scene in 2.0 where she explains her illness and how much its taken from her when she just wanted a normal life. Or the 2.2 scene where she stands up to Sunday's ideas of Order and tells him he probably thinks she's weak too. That was the focus of her writing and its what made her popular (and the cool ass mecha)\n\nI do think that people who say shit like \"oh i wont pull Jade because shes evil so that makes her a bad character\" or similar stuff are wrong. But I'm not going to pretend like the main focus of Jade's writing was the moral dubiousness of her deals, whereas for a character like Firefly it was more about the empathy for her illness and her own personal strength. For example I have no doubt that once the game does go indepth into MC's backstory that they'll make it empathetic or emotional, instead of focusing on \"oh no MC killed people in the past before the game started, theyre a bad person now\". And I'm fine with that ngl, HSR is set in a merciless universe, the characters wont be morally perfect.",
