    "selftext": "1. Her technique cost less skill points than Acheron when there are 2 enemies or more and they clump up. A combat room in current DU will cost her 1 point, while Acheron will need 2 or 3 points. \n\n2. Against Trotters, Herta is the antithesis of Firefly. RIP cute little pigs.\n\n3.  Her technique works against Occurrences and Encounters while Acheron's doesn't. I find this feature is extremely useful.\n\n4. Using The Herta technique + Hysilen boon/The Parchment That Always Eat (Curio) means insta kill.\n\n5. The Herta technique gives mini Herta follow up stacks. When an ally attacks, said FUA stacks will be triggered and Herta will kuru kuru.\n\nThat being said. Acheron kills faster because she doesn't actually enter combat, and she kills in overworld while Herta doesn't. Having *both of them* in overworld is a nice boost of QoL. One kills; another finds treasures. \n\nMadam Herta a peerless gem, Madam Herta is an unrivaled genius. Madam Herta is an inimitable beauty.\n\nPraise the No.83 of Genius Society!",
