Adult looking but minor in universe - Can be argued that the author or designer is baiting people and its understandable to be attracted to them as the age is fictional, and especially if you don't know. Case in point: Bonney from One Piece\n3. Minor looking but adult in universe - Bro...even if she's supposed to be a thousand years old. Being attracted to a child like character makes me question your real-world sexual preferences.\n4. Minor looking and minor in universe - JAIL!\n\nEDIT: Added subnote on 2 because people below are losing their shit.\n\n\\*short characters are a grey area because it is undeniable that young adolescents are short, but short adults also exist. But there is a limit to how short anyone can get before they are literally children in appearance.",

Sparkle is just one of the more popular examples. And we all know hoyo faces are nigh identical so it\u2019s certainly not their face\n\nBut yunno I DO at least respect the consistency even if I find the take itself wild as hell especially considering Sparkle is basically the same size and build (even down to the soft face) as a girl I met and dated in college.

When I look at sparkle, I see her as cute. I can't see her anything more than that. \nAnd trust me, it's something I've always had a problem with. \n\nJapan just has a very sick obsession with children and it's no wonder a lot of people don't like anime\n\nThis same logic also applies to Huohuo as well, I apologize if my comment came off as weird, but I'm just expressing how I feel because Honkai could've made sparkle and huohuo easily look older. \n\nIt gets to a point, yk?",

But because of arbitrary ages assigned to them, lewd pictures or comments with most of them will be accompanied by cheering and approval, but for Clara and Yunli it's going to be nothing but pearl clutching. And how can we forget about Pela, who was perfectly fine to simp for for months, but then that one quest dropped and suddenly you're a PDF file. That's beyond ridiculous, they all are fine, because again, they're literally identical.\n\nAnd if despite reason and common sense someone thinks they're not - I sure hope you're not giving money to  the [company who sexualizes and fetishizing them](https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1esb515/yes_an_official_advertisement_for_hsr_in_china/). That would've been hella hypocritical of you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wussf59q3cpe1.jpeg?width=7680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96aa099f128ab1c51f15b491bf3f8d0f3049175f",

As long as a character looks, and acts, like they could be 18+ it's cool. Of course it is fiction, and you're free to do whatever you want either way, but once you get to the point sexualizing characters that are very obviously supposed to be children, like, no way on gods green earth could you believe in good faith that this character would be an adult type shit (think Kanna from Dragonmaid, or the snail girl from Monogatar), that is sick and disgusting and you should feel bad if you're into that. I don't think you should be harassed or imprisoned for it anything, but please do it somewhere i don't have to see it, or you can expect me to complain about, even if i'm just screaming into the void to vent. As far as not supporting a company who sexualizes those characters, you just have to draw your personal line with how far is too far, because it's basically the entire anime industry (unfortunately) that does it. Hoyo are fortunately one of the tamer examples. I will absolutely drop something if it starts to go too far, like Fate/Kaleid, No Game No Life, or Dance in the Vampire Bund. \n\n  \nIn regard to Clara specifically, i would say that she pretty well acts like a child. Not a small child like Hook or Bailu, but a child still. So i do have a problem with people sexualizing her.",

Because it shows that your convictions on the matter are only strong enough to lash out at other players, which costs you nothing, that you're incapable of making a principled stance that will actually cost you something, in this case entertainment gained from the game. \n\nAs to Clara, she acts like someone who was raised away from civilization and even humanity, because she was. So she's very pure, naive, and rather awkward during conversations with other humans. And of course all those traits are associated with children, but in her case she'd be like that even if she looked like Natasha.\n\nHook for example, despite all the child play stuff, is actually quite a bit more developed socially if you'll pay attention to how she acts and speaks, because she went and keeps going through, all the necessary stages that form us as proper members of society. Clara was robbed of that and it shows.\n\nBut anyway, those are just drawings/3d models at the end of the day, so regardless of how they act, appearance takes precedence over personality for this purpose. Being aware of their lore, or caring about it, is not a requirement for arousement. Even someone who knows nothing about HSR and just sees some lewd Clara artworks will still get aroused by them, just like by any other similar anime girl.

Most anime characters in general don't have entirely realistic personalities, they're usually somewhat exaggerated versions of real personalities. Like, no one is going to actually act like Huohuo on the outside, but i guarantee you there are grown women who act exactly like Huohuo on the inside. Anime just takes that inner panic and says \"inside voice? fuck is that\" and lets the character go full mask off with their emotions and behaviours. I mean, if any real woman acted like Sparkle, they would have a list of felony convictions longer than the Silmarillion. And if they're as hot as Sparkle, i still would.",
