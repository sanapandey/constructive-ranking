If you do not do this and the post is ultimately removed for breaking Non-OC rules, you may be subject to a ban. Please note this is also only for art posts.

Please be considerate of your fellow Trailblazers and do not include spoilers in the \ntitle of your post. Do not forget to flair your post as spoilers if needed, and do not spoil people in your comments.\n\n**All posts with the Discussion, Theory and Lore, and Media flairs are automatically flagged spoilers for the first 3 weeks of this patch.
