Like ... 15 feet away, LOOKING AT THEM, as mydei and phainon discussed mydei stalling him ...\n\nWhy even bother fighting him repeatedly, mydei?  Nikador literally standing there like an idiot while you chat.  Just keep chatting as Nikador stands there till phainon comes back.  \n\nThen it ended with a black screen of \"mydei and nikador disappear under the rubble as they start to fight\" ... \n\nHoly shit.  I have never in my life went 'omfg are you serious devs?' over a single gacha story scene the way I did for that particular scene.  It was intended to be a dramatic scene involving Mydeis heroism and instead it was just stand out terrible. \n\n\nBut I am serious when I say amorpheus is turning out to be *awesome* despite a few shortcomings mostly featured in 3.0.  Like 3.1 was one of the best hoyo patches I've experienced as someone that has played all three of their big games for months/years.",
