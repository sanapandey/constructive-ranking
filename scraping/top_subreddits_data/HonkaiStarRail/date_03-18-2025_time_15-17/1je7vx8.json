    "selftext": "On the one hand, the multi-POV angle that Mihoyo started doing in Trailblaze Missions/MSQ since Patch 2.1 has done wonders to invest players into characters like Aventurine, Feixiao, or Rappa. Whether it's Aventurine or Rappa's backstory or Feixiao's Persona 4 inner turmoil segments, these portions are what I consider among some of the best content the game has to offer. Even in this patch, the backstory we got to these characters, especially Tribbie>!'s nightmare segments!< are so well done, and it was done with a notable step up in presentation as well.\n\nOn the other hand, I really am still confused as to why the inclusion of multi-POV in MSQ seemingly resulted in Companion Missions being axed. I feel like you can have BOTH multi-POV MSQs and Companion Missions that further delve into these characters. Like imagine you can have a POV storyline with Feixiao and after completing the MSQ you get a side story with Feixiao that further flesh out her character and characterization post-MSQ. It also helps flesh out other characters that felt sorely needed a Companion Mission, like Moze, Jade, or Lingsha. Hell, they showed that they can basically have them both with Yunli (although, Yunli's POV didn't delve much into her backstory or character like the previous POVs), how the hell this isn't the norm yet?! \n\nIdk, I feel like for all the good and controversial decisions Mihoyo makes with HSR as of late, this is the one where I felt like damn, they missed out a really good opportunity here.",

I understand that they can't throw her on amphoreus directly and wanted a way to put her in the story, but like why put her in the belebog tile set and a handful of easy fights. Also, while I get that they are building up to something, give hoyo's recent track record, It will reveal something mostly about amphoreus and not Herta. If they want to use main story quests to sell characters, either spend more time developing them in the main story or do that in side quests. This is why I liked aventurine and mydei's arcs because they introduce the characters and flesh them out before their banners. Even the herta is their in the next patch it will have been 2 months since she was revealed.",

As much as we know the aeons have been in conflict before there are actually fewer explicit instances of actual conflict going on in Star Rail right now. The order is dead so Penacony\u2019s wasn\u2019t actually a conflict between aeons more than their followers. Same thing with the abundance and the hunt. With Amphoreous it\u2019s possible they may begin to highlight the importance of emanators to aeons. Herta was Targeted  by the rememberance specifically for her emanator status as well as her connection to Nous. There is an emanator of Erudition and Rememberance on Amphoreous right now it stands to reason that it\u2019s possible their goals may come into conflict. It may not have been a huge role but herta may be a key to learning more about it. Which would raise her importance.",

Companion quests did serve a purpose, but they also had another backet of issues that rear their ugly head upon reflection. Argenti's is probably an excellent case as it doesn't just establish his character, but also connects to later plot points, so low-engagement content that is crucial also ends up harming people.\n\nThe Xiaoxhou companion quests also could of actually benefitted the plotline. And also gives us insight as to why Amphoreus' quest line is now covering all 3.x. The Luofu itself would have later companion quests such as Jingliu's that is neat upon review, but much of HCQ information would of been much better served in the actual plotline.   \n  \nAnd Penacony was a transition phase with it only having the companion quest for BS/Sparkle. Which fundamentally tie right back into Penacony's plots that it does show why Aventurine's was baked in: while great as optional stuff, the content is far better served not being optional as often stuff in these companion quests were details that round out the main story.\n\nI've played all these companion quests when they come out and can certainly see why someone may not touch them for a myriad of reasons. They're labeled as option after all. But as you said: if people aren't touching them, than the effort is best served to the content you do intend players to play as a minimum.",

            "body": "I agree, in a perfect world we'd have both in-depth MSQ and Companion Missions, but I think it just comes down to a few reasons and mistakes they made in the past which created how MSQ works in the recent patches.\n\nTLDR:\n\n1. Players' desire for their favorite characters to play an important role in the MSQ.\n2. Players missing out on important plot pieces because they were placed in an optional Companion Mission with a character the players were uninterested in.\n3. Limited development time and budget.\n\nNow I'll go into it!\n\nNaturally we all want our favorite characters to be story relevant, it feels really bad when a character shows up, doesn't really do much and disappears. Feels much worse when the character feels story relevant but ends up not being story relevant. A good example is Jingliu; completely toss out her companion quest from your head, She shows up and just hints at a past she has with the Xianzhou, \"helps\" Yanqing before becoming antagonistic and vanishes. If you're a Jingliu fan, that's not very exciting. Though you could tell yourself they're sowing the seeds of a future plotpoint, for that patch series it was not a very interesting thing to see. As a Kafka fan, I completely understand this reasoning. I know she's important, but she still hasn't been that important lol.\n\nWhich gets us to the next point! If you did Jingliu's companion quest then you know how related it is to the Xianzhou plotpoint! You even get a better understanding of what the overall goal of Loucha and Jingliu seem to be. Imagine not doing Jingliu's mission, then getting to the point of the story where we find out Loucha was carrying around a piece of Propagation. Sure you still have some dots to connect, but you don't have all the dots that were given. For the Wardance, players who did not do Jingliu's quest would also not know that Jingliu was long gone from the Loufu and Jiaoqiu's comments about Jingliu were 100% lies.\n\nA more recent example is the Stellaron Hunter flashback with Mem. It was a few but I definitely remember a few players being surprised that MC was part of the Stellaron Hunters, and they were met with a \"Uh, duh? Didn't you do Kafka's Companion Quest?\" So the writers accidentally put these important plot pieces in optional quests that they assumed players would eventually do.\n\nThen comes the super unfun reason, because those top two reasons can be fixed allowing writers to create both interesting Companion Missions and MSQ.\n\nMONEY!\n\nDevs realistically only have so many writers and a set schedule to get everything done in. Ya they could technically throw more money at it as the biggest gacha company out there with their absurd monthly earnings. But I'm sure we all know how companies work, bottom line goes up! So much better to reinvest that money into new projects to capture more marketshares vs reinvesting it into a game you already have the audience for.\n\nSo ya, from a development perspective, its just much easier to mash Companion Missions into MSQ that way you can avoid the pitfalls and mistakes they made before. I know for some players its created some pacing issues, but  overall it doesn't cause players to miss out.\n\nAnd just remember even though I'm \"defending\" Hoyo, I would absolutely prefer it if they reinvested more money into HSR and gave us MSQ where our characters shine, then fun personal Companion Missions where we get to know those characters better.",

Which is why I put they could technically throw more money at it, to try to find a sweet spot, but realistically like you said its generally more of a waste for a marginal return.\n\nAnd I should've expanded on the time constraints better, its just more or less this is a live service game so the devs can only take so much time before tossing out a new patch. \n\nI think a lot of players asking for Companion Missions and MSQ to be separate expect similar current lengthy MSQ and a well in-depth Companion Mission as an addition. Which given the time constraints wouldn't happen and all the devs would do chop up the amount of story they have now and split it between those two categories.

I've seen no small number of players be confused in main story due to not playing companion quests, so I find it completely reasonable. \n\nThere are a few companion quests that truly were side content (Hook, Clara, Natasha, Belobog lol). But even then, I feel it would've fine to just have these in main story. \n\nI love learning more about characters as much as the next. But the reason why we can't have both is simple: lack of manpower. Suppose the team that did companion missions diverts that effort towards main story inclusion instead so we get things like Tribbie sequence and whatnot. I'd think it's not as simple as 'hiring more people' to do more work.",

I think it's a huge shame, because a lot of characters will never get the screen time they deserve if they don't get their own companion missions.\n\nThough I think a way around this might be to incentivize players to play companion quests by giving better rewards. Like how story quests in Genshin give you primogems for a limited time after they release.\n\nI can see how, financially, this wouldn't be worth doing for four stars, because those don't bring in nearly as much revenue and so they're not \"worth\" the cost of making the companion quest, but uhh... it's not like we're getting any four stars anyway.",
