In nature animals do engage in incest sometimes, especially if other options are limited. Exactly because at the bottom of incest there is still the \"hole is the goal\" - nature needs to do some work to prevent it (one might say that to some degree incest prevention is less natural than rawdogging your sibling, because first happens without pressure unless there is a counterpressure from evolution, lmao, but i digress). \n\nBasically - we are softwired to be less atracted to people we grew up with, including closest friends and siblings, and on top of that there is cultural patterns that stems from the era where sex = child, and every culture has a \\*very\\* limited gene pool. But this is not a hard programm, so, naturally, it affects different people differently. On top of that - there are different situations that lead to different relations or feelings. On top of that on top of that - some families are less dogmatic in general, thus leaving children with weakened responce to morally virtuouss behavior. Majority of people are either actively disgusted or actively opposed to idea of incest (even without inbreeding) on emotional, illogical level. Some people are indifferent, in a state of \"meh\" regarding the concept. Some turned incest in their personal paraphilia without it influencing their IRL opinion of it. There is also (mayhaps smallest group) those who don't mind incest even in IRL.\n\nFor example - i personally can't understand the logical reasoning behind hating on incest so much. The only reason we hate incest culturally - is because kids get fucked up from too much of it (tho less fucked up than it believed. One or even two generations would simply increase chances of some lurking recessive illness waking up, but that could happen with literally any non-incestual reproduction, its not an inherent property), but in modern age Inbreeding gets neg-diffed by rubbers, so by logical reasoning the only reason to avoid it is because most people are irrationally angry about it.\n\nFunny enough - it doesnt really related to presence of biological siblings. I do have an older sister, and i don't hate the idea itself, its just that she's not my type as a person.  \n\nParaphilias are weird for sure, but not really \\*that\\* weird. Just hindered by social patterns.  \n(regarding the MILF genra - its not always about banging specifically \\*one's own\\* mother. Its just about banging a woman that is proven to be capable of being a mother, which is a huge hard on for any mammal with coupled parenting. After all - our existance is an attempt of an egg to create an egg)",
