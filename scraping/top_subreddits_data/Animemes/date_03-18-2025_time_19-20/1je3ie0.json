I assumed the \"comfort her\" option would be like a \"hey, i didnt realize our relationship was affecting you so much, i also miss (I forger her name) so i get where you are coming from. I will make space for you to spend more time with her.\"\n\nAnd instead they fucked and i think the route basically immediately ends lmao. This was the incident that led to me saving before every choice in vns going forward lmao.\n\nEdit to add: after reading soom of the comments, i clearly forgot some context, in my defense, i played this like right when it came out. I still didnt think the top option would lead to a bone sesh.",
