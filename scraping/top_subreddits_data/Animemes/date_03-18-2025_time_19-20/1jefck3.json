Then she broke Ange's mind and they put her digital mind into Ange's body which she puppetted until she could reveal her master plan which was supposed to turn the world away from relic tech and avenge her creator but kinda failed? Idk the writing at the end of GFL1 was rushed.!<\n\nShe's a really fascinating, if absurd, character. If the end writing wasn't so messy there'd probably be people saying RPK did nothing wrong.

She dedicated their organization to reopening the wormholes in her search for her husband, wholly neglecting her two kids (like, 6 and 4 or something at the time) and overseeing unethical experiments regarding the modification and creation of artificial Pokemon. She inserted herself into the internal politics of the region and bankrolled a gang to cause chaos and destruction as a distraction from her research. Eventually it's revealed that much of her actions were guided by the aforementioned jellyfish literally poisoning her mind and leading to her becoming emotionally and physically abusive to her kids and changing her intent from \"finding her husband\" to \"unleashing the perfection of the alternate dimension upon this world.\"",

Platinum over Diamond and Pearl, but you can't go wrong with either Black or White, and the sequels stand out as well. And, honestly, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire are great Gen 6 titles that really feel like the originals with a new coat of paint, but they don't have the Emerald QOL updates.\n\nAs far as Gen 7, where she's from, you only get that storyline in the original games, which are *a slog* to get through, and the Ultra remakes that came out the year after are definitely the better way to experience them even if the story takes a wildly different direction.",
