We can use this as the base line for what is \"straight\" or not.\n\n(XB+XG)2 = 2 women (lesbians). We can surmise that this is \"straighter\" than the base line of 1 male on 1 female, however this is where things can get interesting.\n\n(XB+XG) + (YG+XB) 1 female on 1 futa\n\nWe have lost one male defining physical trait (the male body) in exchange for one more female defining physical trait (the female body)\n\nUsing this simple formula we can thus derive that (XB+XG) + (XB+YG) > (XB+XG) + (YB+YG) in terms of \"straightness\"\n\nWE can also utilize this formula to place futa on futa roughly on equal footing as male on female in terms of \"straightness\"\n\n\nYou see, sexuality isn't black and white. Everyone's a little gay and everyone's a little straight. Trying to say otherwise is just a nonsensical pissing contest, and really you're just holding yourself back for no reason other than personal pride.\n\nWhat's worse?

                    "body": "To say that something is \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cnot gay\u201d is to operate within a framework that assumes binary distinctions: male and female, attraction to one or the other, and the idea that these divisions are clear-cut and immutable. However, reality is often more nuanced. The term \"futa\" (short for futanari, a Japanese word describing characters with both male and female anatomy) complicates this framework by existing in a liminal space between traditionally recognized sexes.\n\nBut then, what is \u201cgay\u201d? If we take the strict definition\u2014that homosexuality is attraction to the same sex\u2014then the question depends entirely on what we define as \u201csame.\u201d A futanari possesses traits of both sexes, yet does not neatly fit into either male or female categories as they are commonly understood. If two futanari individuals engage in relations, is this same-sex attraction? Or is it something that transcends the binary?\n\nHuman desire does not function like a rigid set of rules, but rather as a fluid spectrum. The Kinsey Scale, developed in the mid-20th century, already proposed that sexuality is not a binary but a sliding scale. More modern understandings, influenced by queer theory, suggest that even this spectrum is insufficient to fully capture the complexities of attraction.\n\nThe question of whether a relationship is \"gay\" depends not just on physical traits but also on the self-identification of the participants. If a futanari identifies as female, and another futanari is attracted to them as a female, does it remain homosexual in the classical sense? Or is it something entirely new?\n\nAnd what if one person has a penis and the other does not? Here, the answer changes again depending on perspective. Is attraction dictated solely by genital configuration? Or is it shaped by gender identity, by personal perception, by the very social constructs we use to define sexuality itself?\n\nIf we turn to philosophy, particularly existentialist and postmodernist thought, we find that categories such as \"gay\" and \"straight\" are human inventions meant to simplify a reality that is anything but simple. Jean-Paul Sartre, for example, might argue that our attempts to categorize desire only serve to alienate us from our authentic selves, while Michel Foucault would point out that sexuality is deeply tied to power structures and historical contexts rather than some inherent, fixed truth.\n\nThus, the question \"Is futa gay?\" may be less about defining an objective reality and more about interrogating why we seek such definitions in the first place. What does it mean for something to be \"gay\" in a world where attraction is complex, shifting, and often resistant to neat categorization?\n\nIf the question is framed rigidly\u2014\u201cIf they both have dicks, is that gay?\u201d\u2014then the answer depends on how we define \u201cgay\u201d and how we prioritize anatomy over identity. If the question is, \u201cIf one has a dick and one doesn\u2019t, is that gay?\u201d\u2014then we must first ask whether sexuality is determined by physical form alone or by deeper, more intangible aspects of attraction.\n\nIn the end, perhaps the real answer is this: sexuality is what we make of it. The moment we seek to define it in absolute terms, we betray its true nature\u2014fluid, evolving, and deeply personal. Perhaps instead of asking, \u201cIs this gay?\u201d we should ask, \u201cDoes this question even matter in the way we think it does?\u201d",
