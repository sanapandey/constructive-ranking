Dracula's vampire form can use a power over pallets and vaults if needed. He got a wolf form for chases and a bat form to travel would the map though in bat form, you won't be able to see survivors.\n\nTbh you just have to know how to use each form to their fullest potential. I would recommend you using mostly the wolf and bat forms to get used to him. Hope this helps!",
