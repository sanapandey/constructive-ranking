I have a \"Distract the killer\" build with Blast Mine and red herring, and I was using it to pull the killer away from the team to the Gen on main. First time i was confused cos he kicked the gen, then made a beeline for me. Worked out he had lightborn, so every time he did it after, I stood directly below him. He never thought to look straight down to see my aura :P",
