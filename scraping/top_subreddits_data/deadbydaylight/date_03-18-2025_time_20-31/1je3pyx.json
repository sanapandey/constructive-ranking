BHVR should add more in depth tutorials for each killer, hell, even adding killer bots to custom matches would go a long way in helping newcomers learn how to play against certain killers.\n\nDBD has the worst new player experience of any game I\u2019ve ever played. I started back in 2020 and it took me 2 years to get every perk (not counting new characters). And remember, this is back when getting a new prestige level meant you lost everything. I can only imagine how much worse it is for new players with nearly 90 characters to get to P3. I fully believe the shrine should be reworked because 4 perks a week chosen at random is horribly outdated with the amount of characters and perks we have now.\n\n\nI could go on and on about this but TL;DR: BHVR needs to prioritize the new player experience. FNAF is gonna bring a ton of new players, and if they don\u2019t like the grind. They\u2019re not gonna stay.",

Not that it really bothers me, but still  worth noting for new players who maybe don't like to mute chat.\n\n  \nEDIT: I also want to add, that I view the bully squad stuff as unfun as say, playing against a killer who only tunnels, or only slugs. It's an unfun tactic, people are more than welcomed to play that way, but BE doesn't do anything to prevent it.",
