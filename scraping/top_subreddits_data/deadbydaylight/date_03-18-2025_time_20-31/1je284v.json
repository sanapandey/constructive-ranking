Before I started trying to grind her achievements I never played Nurse because I found her power difficult to wrap my head around and my first couple of games with her I got absolutely bodied and taunted by the survivors so I just put her aside. I figured it was no loss, no one likes playing against her anyway. \n\nLong story short once I actually committed to the achievements and had to play her, it quickly became obvious that it takes just a handful of hours to get a feel for her power and her overall ability to dominate a match is unparalleled. Sure I will still generally do better with the killers I am more familiar and comfortable with, but the teams who can body me on nurse can do it to me on Huntress or Wesker too. Nurse just fundamentally ignores huge parts of the game, and if you have a little bit of game knowledge it becomes fairly easy to figure out how the survivors you are against will play when you try to blink to them, and then adjust to that. \n\nI wouldn't even say I'm actually good with nurse, but I can pretty much guarantee that if I were to load up the game and play five matches with her, I'd win most of them, and that's not really a good thing in my opinion.",

The \"mori 1 survivor\" daily can be done with 80%+ success rate on the first attempt for every killer in the game except Nurse. A lot of people have failed this challenge for Nurse a few times and given up on her entirely.\n\nOne sensible way to quantify \"is the killer hard to play\" is just to look at how strongly experience correlates to kills. And if that's the measurement you're going with, Nurse is the #1 hardest killer in a landslide. The difference in results between a 100 hr, 500 hr, and 2000 hr Nurse is much more pronounced than those same increments for any other killer. This has strong evidentiary support, given that 2000 hr nurses dominate tournaments while nurse has always had the lowest kill rate in public lobbies.\n\nYou could take \"hard to play\" as meaning something else and come to the conclusion that Nurse is not hard. And I do think that's reasonable. Nurse doesn't require any innate special talent to master. But most of these alternate definitions of difficulty suggest that no killer is hard to play.\n\nPersonally, I think there's a strong argument to be made that \"nurse being hard isn't an excuse for her being overtuned.\"\n\n\"She shouldn't be overtuned because she isn't hard\" would be a much more compelling argument if the premise were true. But the statement \"she isn't hard\" requires so many asterisks on it to be true that it's unwieldy.",

Edge map tiles are notoriously effective against her.\n\nPallets can actually work if she used one blink already. If she still has both blinks they're not really helping but if she used her first blink to catch up to you you can play the pallet and drop it on either side (it's a 50/50)\n\nThe best way to learn how to play against her is to practice with someone who is very experienced with Nurse.
