You can group up with other survivors in the fog, but the more people you group with, the more attention you attract.\n\nKillers / monsters are looking for you, and you can decorate your hide out with ways to slow them down when they come visit.\n\nIf they find you, you gotta abandon your base or try to defend it like the Observer.  As you play the game you can get things like trappers traps, or little things from different realms like blight serum. You find the items exploring the fog or something. I dunno. \n\n  \nAnimal Crossing meets DBD.\n\nI would play that game lol",

I tried burning my hand in it one time, but felt nothing.
