Dishonored has zombie equivalents in both games and they increase with chaos, but on the other hand keeping a lower chaos decreases security in future levels. He also has a great mix of abilities: teleport, stealth, range attacks, melee techniques, magics... Since the series makes a focus on approaching encounters however you please, I feel like he could have dream pallet type add-ons that change his power with different runes or bone charms. Definitely would be one of the more complex killers.",

The thing is, during the times when it is being horror, it can get really extreme.\n\nWhen Junko tied up that Hope's Peak trustee and tortured him to death by gouging out his eyeball while she ate curry with the same spoon, that was horror. When Junko killed herself and was then dismembered by her followers, who replaced their own body parts with her nonfunctional corpse parts (e.g. her arm, her womb, etc),  that was horror. When Junko coerced high schoolers into slaughtering each other for her amusement, that was horror. All the killing games perpetrated by Junko, which are the main setting of Danganronpa, are also clearly horror.\n\nAnd that's not even considering The Tragedy, which was extremely horrific every time it's described in any detail, especially in the novels.\n\nThe list of horror elements goes on and on, but all of it always ties back to Junko. If she didn't exist, the Danganronpa universe would have been pretty peaceful.\n\nThat's why I think when they add Danganronpa to DBD, Junko will be the killer. She is horror incarnate.",
