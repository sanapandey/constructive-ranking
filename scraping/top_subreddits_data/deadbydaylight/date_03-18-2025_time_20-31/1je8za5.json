    "selftext": "Certain killers have playstyles/personalities so agressive that it influences the player..for instance.\n\n Most Knight mains are fucking miserable (myself included), so most of them play locked in because if you dont, you dont get most value of his power. Therefore you mirror a little bit of Tahros Kovac merciless personality, not giving in to survs asking for mercy. You *are* the Knight, and you and the Guardia Compagnia will *kill* these peasants. Especially if you *are a main*. \n\nMost Ghostface mains play in a chill, controlled and calm demeanor when stalking their pray, and sometimes, for the fun of it and the constant thrill of the hunt, they let *survivors go.* That mirrors the most sadist Ghostface till this day that is Danny Johnson, toying with their pray, hoping they remember him in a future encounter (such as another trial).\n\nOni mains can *feel* his rage, and they apply that on their playstyle. They *are* Kazan Yamaoka, and they *will* kill these people. So that makes them play very seriously, thirsting for the 4k, and his brute-like gameplay reflects the player.\n\nWesker mains can feel the sarcasm, the narcicisim on Albert's quotes, and play toying with their food most of the time, especially if they are good and they know they can win if they *wanted to*, mirroring Wesker's entirely MO against Chris.\n\nDoctor mains will *laugh* with the Doctor, they will *feel* his craziness and they will make others as crazy as they are. Hence spamming the shock, controlling the pacients as they show results of the treatment and make sure they do not *escape* your grasp. And if they do, they will come out fucking insane.\n\nAnd most of the time, killer mains tend to merge with their killer and their playstyles, becoming what the killer themselves are. What do you guys think? Is this accurate?\n\n",

Like I said, Only one very infamous youtuber talks like you do, while the people who want to learn the character and I help around this reddit are more on the calm side, maybe your friends could also get a bit of guiding on your part to improve at it, is easier to learn with a helping hand than a laughing doctrine.\n\n>And with the losts, they can get quite merciless. (I know that is the case for most killers, but Knights playstyle is easier to lose than others.)\n\nFrustration breeds this, but also, Failing at \"Merciless\" plays due to innexperience in other fields like map knowledge do takes a bigger toll on people, maybe this why i do not like this approach, as I try to focus more on well rounding people skill sets over the overspecialization.",

Sadistic is laughing with glee as you bring them to hatch just to close it in their faces and mori them. Sadistic is letting them crawl to the open gates before picking them up, walking them until the escape meter is almost full, and mori-ing them all because it makes you feel tingly. Sadistic is 3 gen-ing and then slugging until they give up and/or disconnect because it\u2019s hard proof you\u2019ve gotten to them. Sadistic feeds on misery. They want you to make a post ranting about how awful your match with them was.

And then his laughs makes sense to you. You are the boogeyman, the reason why people fear clowns, you are demented in your search and just like Kenneth Chase, sometimes you take pleasure in killing those (sweaty survs) who think they are better than you. You feel how creepy he is, and you play him as he is. A monster. A sadist. You yourself it's not that, but you feel such while lurking in Chase's skin. The Houndmaster is all about loyalty. Your dog will answer to no one but you and that resonates in having control, not because you have control, but because you got a piece that can change the game, a very loyal pup. She was a pirate, and you feel her accent and story in her dialogue. You will steal their lives, but like a pirate, if a better deal is made envolving them being alive..you could make it.

Do that and I'll be cherishing that moment for weeks or months, depending on how fast the next survivor like that comes along.
