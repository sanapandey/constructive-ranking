My guess is that this is going to be something similar where specific licensed survivors (and maybe a few associated licensed killers) are discounted.\n\nIf I had to take a guess, I'd think that Ripley (and the Xenomorph), Lara Croft, and Ash would be some of the characters on sale.",

To me, it's the literal corporatization of horror, where the genre is stripped of its most interesting parts, replaced by what's marketable and easily mass-produced. Sure, there's creepy elements and all, but it's all \"sanitized\" and fake, if that makes sense. Children's horror used to be cool, like Courage the Cowardly Dog, Billy & Mandy or Coraline.\n\nI don't want to blame FNAF that much, as I've heard its creator is actually very passionate and cares for the IP, unlike the FNAF clones that pretty much embody what I just said.\n\nThat said, I was never against FNAF coming to DbD. The popularity boost the game will get will probably surpass the Resident Evil chapter. If anything, I'm more worried about the game not being in a healthy enough state to maintain that player spike. That's probably the reason why they're doing the health update in the first place.\n\nOh! And while I agree with you that some FNAF fans will probably treat this game as yet another spinoff, I'm more hopeful that DbD will introduce those players to other types of horror.\n\nAs for Tokyo Ghoul, I'm interested to see how they'll translate the anime/manga artstyle into the game.",

It's lost its identity by trying to remain relevant, I guess. I played the first one, I was crap at it, and I think it's sadly become what a lot of survival horror games draw from. I've tried reading up on the lore but I don't get it, and it just feels like... the stan culture of video games, almost? It's one of these things I don't understand. I think it's *interesting* for sure, but it's definitely the least exciting licensed chapter I've seen outside of the survivor only ones. There hasn't been a licensed chapter I haven't been pumped for, but with this one I'll get it, I'll play it, I'll probably enoy it, but I don't personally see FNAF in the same level as Resident Evil or Silent Hill.\n\nA lot of people treat it as *the* horror franchise, and I got tired of the constant FNAF predictions and a minority of folks actively insulting people who *didn't* agree that a clip from Hellraiser was *obviously* hinting at FNAF, or acting as if something like Chucky wasn't relevant when he was literally starring in a TV show (which, by the way, fuck them for cancelling). \n\nI think it left a sour taste in a lot of mouths and it didn't do anything to make people want to play the games. I'm glad that that aspect will shut up, but I just hope that now that the chapter is coming out people act more maturely.\n\nAs for Cawthorn, I think he sold the franchise when it turned out he was a big Trump donater? It makes things a little complicated, even if he's into the IP.\n\nAs for the health increase I do agree it's necessary, but I also wonder how much of it is them anticipating future behaviour as well? Things like the idle crows, Go Next prevention, and isn't there something about no collision to stop body blocking as well? It might be cynical of me but as I said, I don't want people to treat DBD as a FNAF spin-off, but I can see a spike in toxic behaviour \"For the memes\" or people suiciding on hook because they wanted to face Springtrap and ended up going against Sadako. Hopefully those are a minority, and the majority of new players stick around and see what else DBD has to offer, or even potentially get introduced to some other fantastic horror franchises.\n\nAs for Tokyo Ghoul, I think it'll be an interesting addition. There's a lot of different ghouls with their own powers they could draw from, and we've previously seen manga/anime aesthetics done in a way that sticks to DBD's art style while still feeling authentic.",
