I haven't had long droughts of content yet and when the gen kick eruption meta was happening I was super new. I started right before a lot of qol changes were made, but I played without them for a bit.\n\nI think long term, people can lose sight of improvements made to a game. If you remember hyper unbalanced DBD and waiting months hearing no news, I understand why you might feel less trust or confidence in the devs. I think though, being optimistic is better for everyone involved. Ask for what you want, but don't just assume it's over. Give the devs a little bit of credit. They do work sometimes. Better than other games a lot of the time.",

It feels awful to play for both sides, on killer the viable way to play is just not interacting with half the map as despite the nerfs to the dungeon area it's still strong for survivors, portals are also pretty annoying as even after their nerf still manage to punish M1 killers into longer chases.\n\n The viable way to play survivor on this map is hope you're able to do at least 2 surface gens so your last ones can be in the dungeon cause the surface is an easy 3 gen for the killer with pretty weak loops.\n\n It's CBT for both sides as the viable way to play this map is to just ignore parts of it creating longer games.
