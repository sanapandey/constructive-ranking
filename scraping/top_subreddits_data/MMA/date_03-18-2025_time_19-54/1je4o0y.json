Which they described as a frat house with gyms, alcohol, drugs, women. \n\nIn the videos I watched they mentioned that the problem with that side is the blackmail with the cartel taking videos of them doing drugs and extorting the family for more money or else they'd move him back to the gen pop where he'd already been in multiple attacks according to the sources interviewed. \n\nAll the sources seemed pretty grimy, but otherwise MMA media doesn't seem to care to follow the story.",
