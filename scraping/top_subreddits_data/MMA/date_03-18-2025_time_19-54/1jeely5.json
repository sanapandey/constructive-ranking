    "selftext": "After BJ Penn\u2019s recent mental struggles, I began thinking about some of the beatings in his career.  He was my favourite fighter growing up and I remember when his fight against Nick Diaz at 170lbs was announced, I thought it was an absolutely impossible task for BJ to win.  \n\nThis fight was before his big loss streak, but BJ was someone who could\u2019ve fought at 145, and often had fitness struggles, with his main strengths being boxing and bjj.  Nick was someone who could fight at 185, had better boxing than BJ, good bjj, was known for some of the best cardio in the business and had a reach advantage.  The fight played out exactly as expected and I believe Nick made some kind of record for strikes landed (someone correct me on this if I\u2019m wrong).  \n\nThis made me wonder, which fights were the biggest foregone conclusions in your opinions?  I remember some fights at the height of Anderson\u2019s career felt like obvious routine victories, but his opponents were at least worthy challengers so the fights didn\u2019t feel as unnecessary as BJ vs Nick. \n\nWere there any examples worse than this of legit mma pro\u2019s (not James toney or CM Punk) having completely pointless fights where they were destined to get hurt?",

Their third fight was when Charles was obviously surging and close to contendership and Lentz wasn't quite in that area. \n\nLentz is an underrated fighter but he definitely wasn't supposed to be fighting Oliveira and I remember when the fight was booked, everyone asked \"...why?..\"",
