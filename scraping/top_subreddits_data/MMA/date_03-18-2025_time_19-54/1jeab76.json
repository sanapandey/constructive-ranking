Him putting his win streak on the line on short notice and performing really well despite his loss should count for something. Sure JDM was injured, but inactivity is inactivity and should not be rewarded by the promotion over guys actually putting in the work. Shavkat, Ian and Buckley are more deserving.\n\nBut Aussie fighters have mad Dana White privilege, that's why JDM is getting this opportunity and why Erceg is being put into a quasi-title eliminator after losing two in a row, getting dusted by KKF and his best win being Matt Schnell.",
