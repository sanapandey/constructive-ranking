But until the top ten get cycled through and jockey for position for that top spot then they\u2019re all just fighting for the fuck of it. \n\nYou can\u2019t hold divisions up like this and expect them to grow or draw attention. None of the fights in the division mean anything. Tom won the interim title ages ago and has since defended it and will still need to wait 6 more months at the least. It makes those fights meaningless unless there is progression. \n\nThe story you sell is based on the stakes. Right now the stakes are \u201che said mean things\u201d which doesn\u2019t create the same interest as \u201cI will be champion and he said mean things\u201d.",

Jon is significantly lighter and is carrying a decent amount of body fat. He didn\u2019t get massive and look like vitor to move up. Even IF he can take Tom down, I\u2019d venture to guess not for very long. I think he\u2019s outmatched due to the circumstances.",

And it's not like Tom is unusually big for a heavyweight, he normally weighs around the 250-255 mark and is carrying a good amount of fat. \n\nGane has a lot more muscle than both Tom and Jon but Jon ragdolled him once he got his hands on him. Yes, Gane isn't a good wrestler, but he was much younger and larger and we saw how it turned out.\n\nTom has only had to defend 1 takedown attempt in the UFC and he's never faced anyone who is close to Jon's wrestling ability. \n\nI hope we get to see the fight.",

Waiting around for Jon to finish his negotiations with the UFC isn't that much different than Chandler waiting for McGregor. Why bother? Just keep fighting while that sorts itself out. Otherwise, sitting around complaining makes no sense to me. And what does smiling at Pereira's hardship accomplish? You want to be a big name? Fight. That's what Pereira kept doing, and it worked for him. Plus, Tom's legs look like a pitbull's, I imagine from the knee injury. He might as well make the most out of his career with or without Jon, before father time and father injury come knocking for him too.",
