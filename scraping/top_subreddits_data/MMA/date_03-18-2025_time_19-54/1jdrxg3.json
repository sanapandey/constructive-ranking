There are a lot of fights that you will have completely different scoring of if you just mute it and aren't hearing Rogan and DC talking about how who is winning (all commentators can be guilty of it, but those two are on another level of just wildly misrepresenting what is happening in the cage). Rinat/Leal from a few months back is a classic example as it is a pretty close fight throughout, but DC is talking like Leal is just destroying Rinat the whole fight so when the decision comes down for Rinat people were stunned.",

Having two clear rounds and three toss-ups gives you very good odds in a title fight, all it takes if for you to take 33% of those toss-up rounds, whereas other party needs 100%.\n\nDC vs Gus all those years back is a good example. The first and fifth are clear DC rounds and one might make an argument for the middle three rounds going to Gus, but they were very close, all it takes is for one of them to be scored for DC and he's got in the bag.",

OTOH the two clearest rounds both definitely go to Ankalaev. Even the 1st round, which every judge scored for Pereira, was very close (and I think the judges got that round right too).\n\nAll of this is to say that I think Ankalaev/Pereira is another example where scoring the fight as a whole would yield a much more obvious winner than the round-by-round 10-point must system.",

People pay to see a FIGHT, not this bullshit. If he was so confident in his striking why wasn't his instinct to up the pressure and attempt to get a KO? Or put him on the ground and gnp him? Why do they always choose to stall entire rounds to chase a decision win, then go on to act oblivious why fans are critiquing them",
