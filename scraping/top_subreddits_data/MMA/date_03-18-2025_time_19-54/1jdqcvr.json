Have you every shoveled mulch **that's** back-breaking. Professional fighters aren't being pushed to their limit physical limit every training session. That's how you get injuries.    \n\nIntense wrestling training and weigh-cuts are probably the most exhausting. But there are D3 college students that do that while going to school full-time. Hard sparring can be pretty rough but most fighters don't do that frequently, some skip it all together.",

Shoveling mulch is only particularly hard on the back if you have shit form or shit equipment.\n\nProfessional UFC fighters seem to train throughout an entire day during their fight camps. Some of those fuckers *live* in the gym and some of them have described exactly what I'm describing. \n\nYeah, professional fighters aren't pushed to their limit, neither are landscapers if we're generalizing.
