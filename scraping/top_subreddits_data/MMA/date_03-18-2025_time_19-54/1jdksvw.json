I think he should be the first for Ilia to fight. It would be a bit of throwing a sheep to a wolf for Dariush, but I don't see anyone else being willing to take the fight with Ilia. Oliveira and Gaethje are both trying to angle for getting a title shot. Dustin wants to retire but wants it to be on a win, and he also wants to fight an established name at Lightweight. I think Dustin will probably angle for either Gaethje or Oliveira, but I think Dana will probably want them to fight each other. I'm fairly certain Arman won't settle for anyone but Islam, and I think Islam wants the same. I think Dana will put Dustin with Holloway since it is sure to be a slug fest, and Dana loves those. That leaves Hooker, Chandler, and Gamrot in the top ten, so they may also be good candidates for Ilia.\n\nBut then again, I am a bit biased. I don't like it when someone moves up a weight class and gets an immediate title shot. Maybe if someone has cleared out their division, I can understand it, but I feel there are other guys who should get an opportunity ahead of Ilia. Assuming Islam beats Arman and assuming Gaethje wins his next fight (if he has one), then I think after Arman, you have to have Islam/Gaethje as they have not fought each other before. Then you can have Ilia fight for the title (assuming he wins 2 in lightweight).",

And in that case I like Islam v. Ilia. Islam however seems to be very reluctant to accept another FW fight and from his perspective I understand why. He already doesn't get due credit for his wins over Volkanovski. As a matter of a personal opinion if we are going to tell a fighter in this scenario to fuck off and fight who they are told then I don't think it should be Islam. The man has always done right by the fans taking short notice challengers when his contenders pull out and he is the champ. If any fighter's opinions are to be taken into consideration here it should be Islam.\n\nThe same stretch of thought that would keep Ilia out of a title fight keeps Max out. Forcing Islam to defend against Holloway is forcing him to fight an even less deserving FW than Ilia (or at least that is how Islam will see it) so it's the same thing as with Ilia. I'm sure Dana could force Islam to do it but I don't know why he would since he could just set up Dustin and Holloway for Dustin's last fight and then do something better with Islam. \n\nThis takes us back to either Gaethje or Olivera for Islam and forcing the other to fight Ilia. Take your pick on that but I think Gaethje v. Islam makes the most sense of those options.\n\nIf Dana decides to force an Islam v. Ilia fight...fan-fucking-tastic. I will host a BBQ for that sort of fight. Although I doubt that is the direction he goes with this since it would just aggravate Islam for little gain to Dana.\n\nAnd to be clear, I don't think Justin deserves a title shot.

Max is one of those guys that doesn't need the belt to still be one of the most popular fighters on the roster. Plus if DP won the BMF belt and retired it just opens up the belt for them to use in another fight to market.",

Anybody who wants to get to the top few spots can grind their way up like anyone else, taking the opportunities where they come.

Justin when he was at #3 coming off a loss fighting Fiz when he was at #6 coming off a win made usual sense so that's what happened and it went how it went, with no better proof than that needed of who belonged where.

Gaethje since then has only beat an opponent who didn't even have a camp AND got taken down easily within seconds AND has already had multiple title opportunities (which doesn't exactly make an Islam fight and exciting \"what if\"). \n\nCharles lost to Arman, so it just makes no sense for him to get a title shot before Arman, especially if you want to maintain the \"meritocracy\" of the sport and since then his only win is over Chandler... Who should not be a title fight earning opponent. In his past 4 fights he's lost to both Islam and the #1 contender Arman. \n\nArman in my opinion deserves the fight the most, he deserves it more than Ilia because Arman is the actual #1 contender, he deserves it more than Charles because his last fight was beating Charles and he deserves it more than Gaethje based on what I just laid out for Gaethje a second ago\n\nHowever the UFC and the fans have gotten all up in their feelings about Arman pulling out so he's apparently not an option anymore. \n\nWhich literally only leaves Ilia. \n\nIlia isn't taking someone's spot, he's not messing up the order of the rankings, because there is no clear contender available. Well, except Arman... Who just isn't getting that shot a 2nd time without beating someone else first (which I don't agree with, but seems to be the reality of the situation). \n\nSo it means either Ilia gets it, even though he's not a lightweight, or a lightweight gets it even though they don't actually deserve it. \n\nFrom what I can gather, fans want Gaethje or Charles to get it... Simply just because they're fan favourites. I get it, I like them both, but neither deserve it under any sort of ranking or win streak perspective. The argument for them getting a shot is purely emotional.",

Then they gave him Chandler who honestly might not even be a top 10 lightweight at this point and he completely outclassed him as he should have. Then Ilia KOs the two best featherweights ever and moves up. So like has he earned a title shot? He already had earned one and has had 3 fights since then. The Ilia fight makes sense in a way but he\u2019s 36 and definitely only has 1 more shot at the belt, it seems unfair to give him someone that has never fought at lightweight and only has 1 title defense.\n\nAlso none of this matters because no one is beating Islam lol.",

He had a proper reign as a champ, so an immediate rematch is common and they booked it, however he got injured. He then took a contender fight, which is again not necessary after his reign, he could\u2019ve just waited, but beat Dariush in an impressive fashion. He more than earned his shot, when he lost a very close fight in a 3 rounder against Tsarukyan. So he went back to the contenders, beat Chandler, and is now the logical next contender after Tsarukyan. \nSo he fought contender fights twice without the need, and fought a contender a third time to earn his position again and should now fight another contender coming up a weight class to put his position in danger again? It\u2019s pretty clear to me why he wouldn\u2019t fight Topuria at this stage.",

If there was no weight cutting, we weren't still pretending that we 155ers are 155 , there would be no logjam rn. Too much pain is a valid reason, I reckon you'd feel like you're going through back surgery without anesthesia while cutting weight with a locked up back. I definitely don't blame Arman.\n\n\n\nAgain, he's rich. He can hire a nutritionist, probably mamy. Like... What reason does he have to miss weight.

            "body": "If Ilia has to fight a top-5 fighter at lightweight to get a championship fight, then his best option is Gaethje. He is a high-profile fighter, ranked #3, and extremely susceptible to getting caught in the pocket. Gaethje likes to stand and bang. Arman is also a good option, as he is the #1 contender, but I guess Arman doesn\u2019t want this fight. Arman also has poor boxing defense and has a similar height and reach to Ilia. The other options are Oliveira and Poirier, but these might be the worst matchups for Ilia, with Poirier being the most dangerous.\n\nOliveira is susceptible to getting hit, but his ground game is extremely dangerous. He\u2019s always in your face with forward pressure, and there are three things that Ilia struggles against: 1) a fighter with more reach than him (Max has the same reach as Ilia despite being taller), 2) when he\u2019s on his back foot, and 3) when he\u2019s on the bottom. Oliveira\u2019s submission game is also world-class, and unless you have the wrestling pedigree of Islam or Arman, you\u2019re not escaping it.\n\nIf the fight goes to the championship rounds, I do favor Ilia, as Charles tends to get more hittable later in the fight and often leaves his guard down. However, I could see Charles being the slight favorite in this matchup, or it could be a 50-50 fight.\n\nPoirier is probably the worst matchup for Ilia because his boxing is elite. He\u2019s really good at rolling with punches and countering. Ilia also overextends a lot, and with a reach disadvantage against a guy like Dustin, who is excellent at countering in such situations, it\u2019s not an ideal matchup. However, the biggest disadvantage Poirier has is his grappling. If Ilia is more powerful and stronger at 155 lbs, he could dominate Dustin on the ground and possibly choke him out. But Dustin has recently shown how good he is defensively on the ground, especially against Islam. This could lead him to lose the fight on the judge\u2019s scorecard. Regardless of all this I do think that Ilia is a future LW champ, since Islam might move up or retire in a few years and Ilia just turned 28. He has at least 8 solid years left in the game.",
