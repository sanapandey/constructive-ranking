And was dropped by a 155er in kickboxing. UFC hype just a funny thing. And he was Koed literally Cold for minutes like 2 years ago on top of it. He can be beat Tons of different ways. Cage humping. Cage dirty box. Seen him get dropped by a leg kick bad in kickboxing. Been dropped. Can be wrestled. Can be controlled or submitted. You can beat him and most kickboxers 100 diff ways in MMA. I\u2019ve been preaching this for years about Izzy and him and any life long Kickboxer. They are terrified of being on back too which opens up lucky overhand punches too.\u00a0",
