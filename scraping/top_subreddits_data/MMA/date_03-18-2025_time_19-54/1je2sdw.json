You could have a situation where the best prospects fight each other fairly early in their career. It takes longer for the losers to get into the title contention. For e.g., a young inexperienced Oliveira was fighting and losing to guys like Miller, Cerrone, Swanson, Pettis, etc. He was the middle-of-the-pack kind of guy. Meanwhile, other fighters like O'Malley and Pereira get a padded record of tailor-made matchups on their way to the title shot. The BS rankings made by the media are trying to present this illusion of who a contender, gatekeeper, etc. is.",

Also, even tho he was losing, you can still tell some guys have that potential given Oliveria always had elite tier BJJ. He was a guy that desperately needed to change weight classes. What traits like that has Petrosyan shown in his 4 loses or even his wins? Hes also 34 so its not like he has some time to figure it out, its kinda put up or shut up time \n\nAnd yeah, some guys gets cherry picked up the rankings, but it\u2019s not like someone like OMalley got fraud checked, he still got pushed up the rankings and beat elite contenders/champions like Yan, Chito Vera, and Sterling only losing to one of the greatest BWs ever. Same as Pereria who had insane kickboxing pedigree and beat champions in two different weight classes. What has Petrosyan shown in any of his fights that give you any confidence he can win a top 5 fight rn?\n\nYou can cry foul about media rankings and match making all you want, but some guys have it and some don\u2019t. When you get finished in 3 straight to guys I would consider good, not great, \u201clegit\u201d contenders, I\u2019m more inclined to say he is not in that tier",
