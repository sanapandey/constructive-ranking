Apex card feels like an alternate universe that fighters drop into as punishment.",

Casual fans will make a decision to watch a fight based on how compelling the fighters are.  If a fans reaction on hearing about a main event is \"Wait, who the fuck are Manel Kape and Asu Almabayev\", they are not going to google them to learn that Kape is a former Rizin champ or that Almabayevis on a 17 fight win streak.  They are most likely going to choose to watch something else.\n\nA fighter on a long win streak who has earned a title shot in fights that were all prelims and fight nights that no one watched is not going to sell any tickets or pay per views, even if the title shot is earned on competitive merit.\n\nEND COMMUNICATION",
