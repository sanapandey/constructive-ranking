If he loses, he should just retire already, cuz where do you even go from there?\n\nEveryone was shitting on Paddy after the whole robbery debacle w/ Jared Gordon, and rightfully so....but then he comes back and chokes out Bobby Green in the opening round, and suddenly people start acting like he's some kinda bonafide World Beater? Hell naw, I ain't buying that shit...King Green's scalp ain't worth THAT much, dawg \ud83d\ude02\n\nChandler might lose more than he wins, but he's proven that he can consistently hang amongst the division's elites. I think he's gonna make light work out of the Baddy....",
