    "selftext": "We have guys like Jon Jones and Marvin Vettori who have really good chins but don't hit very hard. Also Colby and Nate Diaz who have great cardio but not much power either. I guess that also Max Holloway altho he knocked out Justin Gaethje out cold in UFC 300. I saw people saying Cyril Gane also can't hit really hard despite being a heavyweight. We always speak of the guys who hit really hard like Ilia Topuria, Alex Pereira, and Francis Ngannou. But what about the guys who are the opposite of it and don't hit hard at all?",

Obv being big helps and shit, but true KO power has done definite proof of why lol. And tbh the hardest hitters don\u2019t have most KOs cause guys get scared to get hit from feeling 1 shot, or speed of punch flying by. Getting actual KOs is mostly due to not seeing or expecting the punch. Brute power punchers won\u2019t have most KOs always, cause your brain says don\u2019t open up after feeling one and it\u2019s hard to get KOed if you don\u2019t open up at all.\u00a0",

What he does in terms of mixing it up, adjustments, and relative to the background of his individual MMA subdisciplines is insane if you think about it. Dude is a medium decent striker, high school wrestler in background, and not even a super dangerous submission artist holding only a brown belt in BJJ. And hes outclassed significantly scarier looking competition from the eye test with just smart solid fighting.\n\nI dont find him boring, I like watching how he dismantles competiton that everyone thinks SHOULD be better than him.",
