Sitting out waiting for 'what is right' will make him miss out on paydays and further building his own legacy. The fans know he is being ducked, the fans know he is the best HW in the world. Take the Volkov 2, Gane or Almedia fight and move on. Of course Jones is dreaming that Tom will lose to one of the other contenders so he can go around saying 'Aspinall wasnt all that afterall'. \n\nYou already lost a year of your career for absolutely fucking nothing. The point is its inactivity from one of the biggest stars regardless of context. If UFC wanted to strip Jones they would have done it over a year ago. They are enabling this, they are not Tom's friend. They side with Jones by giving him the Miocic fight, and would have given him Potatan if he didnt lost to Ankalaev. They will cook up some other stupid dish instead. Ultimately the product suffers from the best not fighting the best at HW and we dont even get to see two fights a calendar year from the fan favourite..",

In terms of it never happening. You added the context of him being in the right for waiting. Two different things. He is chasing his biggest legacy fight, biggest money fight, against someone that has no intention of stepping inside the octagon with you. In that aspect it's identical to Chandler's situation. Either way, it's inactivity at the end of the day which is the spirit of my comment. Many fan favourite fighters are sitting out for different reasons and we get to see diluted cards week to week. \n\nYou can keep gobbling up that Dana will offer Jones the alleged 30 mil dollars and set a dangerous precedent going forward to the rest of the roster. These are similar narratives to when Ngannou Jones were in the mix (Jones wanting bronze bomber esque pay cheques etc etc). Jones prices himself out and takes the easier fight in ciryl gane, Miocic opposed to Ngannou and Aspinall. Rinse repeat. \n\nBut sure, Jones will all of a sudden come down in his salary demand and take the fight in the summer older, more shopworn. Like Dana insinuates.",

This also hurts engagement and diminishes not only the fan experience but the growth of the sport.\n\nThere must be a happy medium that doesn\u2019t allow for the inmates to control the prison, but also allows for them to have rights as fighters while still delivering a quality product and fighting consistently.",

Old Overeem showed he wasnt from the start\n\nDont you people wanna see Tom tested in a real fight? Jones just gonna make it boring anyway win or lose..Give him Almeida whos kinda chinny but atleast maybe hell actually grab Tom and see if he falls apart on the ground again like he did vs Stuart Austin..him fighting Jailton will tell us alot about Tom..outside a early flash KO which is possible obv. Tom rushes everything so i see Jailton dipping down and getting a takedown at the start for sure",
