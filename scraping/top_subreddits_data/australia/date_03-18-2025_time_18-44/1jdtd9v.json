I am in my late 60's and the reason I have lived this long without too many problems with said wildlife is if I find see something I don't go and try poking it up the bum with a stick to see what it does. I leave it alone and it leaves me alone. I watch where I walk and let the wildlife do it's thing after all it is just common sense. Why must tourists touch everything is beyond me",
