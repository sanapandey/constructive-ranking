She doesn't believe it would work because dentists just charge too much. What she (and a lot of people fail to consider) is that including dental in Medicare is the first step, the second step would be the government offering incentives for dentists to join the public health system, same as they do for GP's and surgeons. Up the number of grads, and offer them places in hospitals and government clinics. Suddenly there is competion in the world of dentistry and the private facilities have to start competing. Sure, there will be a transition period where stuff is still expensive (may even go up - if the dental lobby retaliates) but in the long run it's nothing but upside.",
