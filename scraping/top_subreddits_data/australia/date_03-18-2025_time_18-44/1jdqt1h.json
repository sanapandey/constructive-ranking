    "selftext": "A small number of Melbourne residents have received anonymous letters purporting to offer a police bounty of $203,000 if they inform on an Australian citizen and pro-democracy activist wanted for alleged national security crimes in Hong Kong, linking him to two nearby locations.\n\nA spokesperson for the foreign minister, Penny Wong, told Guardian Australia the letter was \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d and that the matter would be raised directly with officials from China and Hong Kong.\n\nThe anonymous letter \u2013 mailed from Hong Kong and delivered to some Melbourne homes on Friday \u2013 contained a photograph of Kevin Yam with a headline alleging he was a \u201cwanted person\u201d. It then detailed a range of alleged \u201cnational security related offences\u201d and offered HK$1m (A$203,000) from the Hong Kong police to anyone who provided information on his whereabouts or took him to Hong Kong or Australian police.\n\nYam is a lawyer who lived in Hong Kong for 20 years before returning to Australia in 2022. He is one of eight overseas-based activists, the subject of Hong Kong police arrest warrants, accused in July 2023 of breaching its controversial national security law that grants authorities sweeping extraterritorial powers to prosecute acts or comments made anywhere in the world that it deems criminal.\n\nYam has criticised the crackdown on dissent and erosion of judicial independence in the Chinese-controlled city and has been accused of encouraging foreign governments to impose sanctions against members of the judiciary, prosecutors and government officials.\n\nIt is not known who sent the letter but its language matches a public appeals notice published on the Hong Kong police force\u2019s official website. A UK phone number included at the bottom of the letter has also been linked to the Hong Kong police force, which was contacted for comment.\n\nThe letter, which gives a detailed account of Yam\u2019s physical appearance, listed a residential address in the Melbourne suburb of Abbotsford and another in the Melbourne CBD. The letter was sent to homes adjacent to these locations.\n\n\u201cA reward of $1m HKD is being offered by Hong Kong police to any member of the public who can provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take him to Hong Kong and Australian metropolitan police,\u201d the letter claimed.\n\nThe letter urged people with information on Yam\u2019s whereabouts to contact Hong Kong police force\u2019s national security department. It also noted Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for security, Tang Ping-keung, declared Yam an \u201cabsconder in respect of offences endangering national security\u201d on 24 December 2024.\n\nSimilar letters with the exact formatting were mailed to neighbours of former Hong Kong district councillor, Carmen Lau, who lives in the UK, earlier this month. Lau told NBC News she did not \u201cfeel safe living at my current address\u201d as a result.\n\nWong\u2019s spokesperson said the targeting of an Australian citizen was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Australian government will not tolerate surveillance, harassment or intimidation against individuals or family members here in Australia \u2013 this undermines our national sovereignty and the security and safety of Australians,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe are raising our concerns directly with Chinese and Hong Kong authorities.\u201d\n\nA Hong Kong government spokesperson said it would not issue an anonymous letter, but stressed it would \u201ctake every measure\u201d to pursue those accused of breaching its national security law. This included \u201ccutting off their funding sources, so as to prevent and suppress them from continuing to engage in acts and activities endangering national security\u201d.\n\nThe shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, described the letter as an \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d example of foreign interference. He supported the government\u2019s efforts to contact Chinese and Hong Kong officials.\n\n\u201cThose who distributed this pamphlet should be investigated under the espionage and foreign interference laws,\u201d Paterson told Guardian Australia. \u201cSerious consequences must flow to send the strong message we won\u2019t tolerate this crude attempted intimidation\u201d.\n\nIn July 2023, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged Australia, the UK and the US to stop sheltering the eight activists.\n\n\u201cRelevant countries need to respect China\u2019s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong, stop lending support for anti-China elements destabilising Hong Kong, and stop providing a safe haven for fugitives,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen the warrant for his arrest was issued, Yam vowed not to be silenced. He said he felt an obligation to jailed fellow pro-democracy activists \u201cnot to shut up\u201d. Since then, he has called on the Australian government to consider sanctions against Chinese officials.\n\nIn August last year, Yam told an Australian parliamentary inquiry \u201cthe Hong Kong authority\u2019s act of placing a bounty over my head is by no means one of merely seeking to defend China\u2019s national security\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey have in fact interfered with my exercise of fundamental freedoms and democratic rights as an Australian,\u201d Yam told a Senate standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade. \u201cIf they can see fit to do this to me, in respect of normal democratic discourse and interactions that took place in Australia, they can do it to any Australian.\u201d",

You would target their social media, obviously. 24/7 hammer every online shelter with your centric viewpoint intended to achieve your goals.\n\nBut for those who don\u2019t have an online presence, you still need to generate engagement. This is chilling at it\u2019s finest as an erosion of social cohesion because as stated, it\u2019s the prisoner\u2019s dilemma on if you can trust your own country\u2019s population to not rat you out if you became unpopular overseas. \n\nIf you believe that someone would take the $200k, you start trusting less. Your ingroup shrinks. Become less charitable and more risk adverse. Classically you become more conservative.\n\nThis is quite literally out of a playbook you can google on what should be considered on how to achieve geo-political aims.\n\nThis stunt costs about 200-500k in wages & supplies and will cause shockwaves through Australia for days, the psychological impact might last for months. Which when the budget is being released on Tuesday and the election In less than 2 months away means this is another expected minimum viable product of force projection.",

They operated from the Embassy in Sydney and installed agents that just came to sit in and monitor these alumni groups without invitation or joining them. They did this with the implied threat from the Embassy on behalf of the  Chinese government.\n\nThey really should call in the ambassador.
