If they all got together and agreed to  pass laws that fixes the issue it would begin the start for change in less than 1 month. Just like they all cheer and pass anti-terrorism laws within a week and nobody in any party objects.\n\nYep so none of the major parties care and that is the reality and change now will never happen.

The data is sourced from [SQM](https://sqmresearch.com.au/weekly-rents.php) (foot note 1 of the report).\n\nPage 2, table 2 of the report illustrates the problem.

            "body": "Fellow renter here, I share the sentiment that the rental market is difficult, but I'm sceptical of the conclusions in the headline and in the underlying study - I fear it robs Renting advocates of the credibility it should rightly have. \n\n\\- Typically, I've heard rental stress being defined as spending anything more than [30%](https://www.realestate.com.au/advice/how-much-rent-can-i-afford/) of your Gross Income on rent. If this is the assumption they're using in the study, they're being incredibly disingenuous by using 30% of **post**\\-tax income as the definition of rental stress. (e.g., for the $130,000 pa (gross income) group , they used $566/$1876\\*100 to get to the 30% figure, where $1876 is the **after tax** weekly income of the group) \n\nThis feels like them moving the goal post - because if we're sticking to the gross income definition of rental stress, then the real figure is more like $97,552 pa. which is still far above the median income - so I'm not sure why they felt the need to make such a risky move to generate headlines like these that will only convince the already convinced and push away property owners who are sympathetic to the cause of the renters. \n\nBut I also think their methodology doesn't do justice to the severity of the situation for low-income earners. AFAIK, [even their own citation of the 30% rule ](https://www.ahuri.edu.au/analysis/brief/understanding-3040-indicator-housing-affordability-stress)references the need for applying the 30% rule only to income groups that are in the bottom 40% of Australia's income distribution (If I'm understanding them correctly!), because raw percentages can be misleading! \n\ne.g., So someone making $120k gross would still have $1180/wk to spend after tax and rent, which hardly sounds like rental stress whereas if we suppose someone was on $60k gross but say had a crazy good rental deal of 20% of their post-tax income would be left with $770/wk to spend after tax and rent - and yet accoring to this 'simplified' definition of housing stress, the person w/ $1180/ week after rent and tax is in rental stress but the guy with $770/wk isn't? \n\nThe worry is that since the study casts such a wide definition of housing stress, we're going to have people earning $120k p.a. telling everyone that they're facing rental stress, yet their lifestyles are going to be anything *but* pitiable - so people end up getting numb to the idea of 'rental stress' and the real people who are truly suffering get lumped as being 'entitled'.",
