It's callous but it's true.\n\nSpending billions so old people can have another decade with better teeth before they die is the kind of thinking that keeps dental in the \"too expensive\" basket. The goal should be getting it back under the Medicare umbrella and that means keeping costs down.\n\nSpend it on routine checkups for kids so they keep their teeth healthier. Cheaper to implement, far better benefit in the long run.\n\nIt would also be the first government decision in forever that would place the *next generation* as the priority instead of making sure Boomers get everything they feel is owed to them.",

Also I think there are some free dental programs, I know my daughter has a free dental service that visits the state schools in QLD but it\u2019s pretty limited.",

Very slowly.\n\nIf they said \"anyone born from 2025 onward gets complete dental coverage for life, but we're leaving the current system in place for everyone else\" it would be a more economical way to do it. \n\nLet it unfold as people age up. \n\nThe rest of us have to bite the bullet (painfully, with dodgy teeth) to let the next generation reap the rewards.",

If it works the same way, there will be assessment for eligibility.\n\nI'm a dentist and I see many people that would benefit from this system as the current one is not helping to prevent disease. \n\nThat said, putting it under Medicare has its own risks. We can look to the NHS to see potential pitfalls. \n\nPersonally, I think the proposed senior benefits scheme targets a population of risk but I would like to see it extended to everyone who qualifies for welfare benefits.\n\nI've seen too many people in their 20s-40s with teeth needing extraction because they couldn't afford care and had to postpone treatment to the point that teeth were too far gone.",
