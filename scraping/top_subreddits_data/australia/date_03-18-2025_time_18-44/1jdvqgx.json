The maximum penalty for manslaughter in Victoria is 25 years, begs the question how could you ever get sentenced to the maximum?",

Well 25 years is longer than the vast majority of murder sentences, so the culpability would have to be extreme, and the offender would have to show no remorse, not plead guilty, and have an extensive criminal record of serious offending, and have very few mitigating circumstances. The vast majority of individuals who commit crimes do have mitigating circumstances, so the maximum penalty is really a theoretical benchmark which will always be discounted from.",

This guy had a 48 year sentence changed to a 30 year sentence to be more in line with other punishments handed down. I don't care what you think about this particular case, he deserves the same severity of punishment as others who committed similar crimes. And those who think 30 years in jail is some slap on the wrist seriously lack any understanding of how long each minute lasts in prison, how humans work, or how this broader structure is designed to work. Prisons are only partially there to keep offenders away from the broader public, and it costs a lot to do so. They are also there to at least attempt to rehabilitate and release. If you think 30 years down the drain over the most crucial decades of your life isn't serious or enough to make you think twice about your actions, you really lack imagination and need to calm the fuck down.\n\nEdit: to all of you mindlessly replying \"tell us you touch kids without telling us you touch kids\", you may be borderline illiterate.

That's what the article/post is about - the change to his sentence - not the original sentence or his crimes. I said nothing of whether the statutes need adjusting or the nature of the crimes. My response is partially to this post but fuelled mostly by the relentless barrage of this type of article across a range of crimes, ones which I have also made this kind of comment on. People don't read the actual article or understand the case but leap in to rage-scream at each other about how evil this person must be.\n\nA simple read of the article, which would be contain maybe 10% of the facts presented in court at most, shows that the defence successfully argued he had poor understanding of the impact due to where he was on the ASD spectrum and his own history of being sexually abused, for example.\n\nDoes this make it ok? No. Does it mean he should get a lesser sentence than typically applied? No. And to a million other of these questions, no. I would say and have said this about other much less severe contexts. Would I be in favour of increasing the statutory minimums for sexual violence and other such crimes, considering I do believe them to be worse or on par with murder? Yes.\n\nWill you all still bend over backwards to believe that I am simply mindlessly defending a paedophile because I love to touch kids? You bet.

And the judge said that the time he was sexually abused did not appear to be behind his offending. The article simply said he appealed on those grounds. It could be that he played up those angles simply to get an appeal, including convincing a psych he was less well-functioning than he actually was.\n\nEvery time someone rapes a child -- and I mean EVERY TIME -- that person says they did it due to any or all of these things: depression, being suicidal, mental health issues, under stress, ASD etc.\n\nYet instead of seeking help for these issues, the person decided to rape a child.\n\nThere is no connection there. None. The vast majority of people who have all or some of the above issue do not think \"I'm gonna rape a/my child today\".\n\nNope. The desire to rape a child is already there -- at which point no crime has been committed -- but then they decide to go ahead with it.",

My opinion on that front largely stems from studies suggesting that the genera public is way more lenient in sentencing than judges when they are both presented with the actual facts and human complexities of the case. The general public is harsher than judges when both see just a headline summary.\n\nTo specifically address your source question, what I said was based on this bit of the article:\n\n>The offender appealed his sentence on the grounds that he was sexually assaulted, that his mental health issues increased the need for specific deterrence, \u00a0and that the sentence was manifestly excessive.\n\n>His defence also argued autism spectrum disorder impaired his understanding of relationships, his ability to recognise non-verbal cues, and that he had fixated interests of abnormal intensity in regard to sexual activity.\n\nGiven that the judge seemed to agree with adjusting his sentence back to the usual 30 years, my interpretation of this was that the defence had been successful on this approach. Not necessarily on the specific sub-points (like, as you say, it says earlier in the article that the court did not agree with the ASD influencing things \"in a material way\" though the word 'material' there might be doing some heavily lifting), but that overall the court agreed that these were collectively mitigating enough to not warrant the extended sentence.",

Most people only read the headline.\n\nThe weirdest thing is when people wish the offender rape/violence in prison. I mean, what are they hoping for, exactly? I do totally understand the eye for an eye feeling, but for it to happen, you need jails to have the kind of offenders who rape people to gain a sense of power--which already describes almost all rapists. What a thing to hope for! And why should violent rapists get to do what they want most?\n\n>...overall the court agreed that these were collectively mitigating enough to not warrant the extended sentence.\"\n\n  \nTo me, it seems like the sentence was too lengthy in the first place. But I'm no expert on the legal system and maybe they do that so that there is space to \"give some years back\" if an appeal with mitigating factors is launched, even if those mitigating factors are weak.",

No, I would have to see much more evidence before making my mind up (as the court probably did). Do I think this should mean we excuse or let him off easy? No, this was used to justify being given the \\*regular\\* punishment over the extra-severe one, which is not the same as being let off easy from the normal punishment.\n\nBut this does change the equation for possible rehabilitation. If it is true, then spending 30 fucking years thinking about why everyone got so mad at you for something that seemed not so bad in the moment, and being relentlessly abused by other inmates for it the whole time, are probably going to incentivise this guy to just not fucking do this type of shit again.\n\nOr not. Maybe he is just lying and/or malicious. Maybe there is no possible rehabilitation. Maybe being relentlessly abused by other inmates for this will make him less rehabilitatable. I don't know. The actual point I am trying to communicate is that every situation is more complicated than a headline can convey and in this case, I went from thinking he couldn't be rehabilitated to actually reading the article (shock!) and thinking ok maybe I don't actually know",

There is no common law precedent.\n\nSecondly, this guy was given basically the maximum within that range because that is how the judge felt about the severity of this case.\n\nWhat this article is about is them arguing that there were mitigating factors (ASD particularly but also prior history of being sexually abused) and that these should be grounds for a middle-of-the-road severity assessment rather than the extreme severity assessment. I don't know if that's true, but the court would have seen a mountain of evidence not in the article and used that to decide. They pointed out that the original severity of sentence had historically been given to people who, in the example, had 7 times the number of otherwise identical offences. \n\nThat's... related... to the concept of precedent, but not the same thing. Just an argument presented to the judge and totally non-binding. This is managed by legislation rather than common law so the concept of precedent doesn't apply here.",

On principle we need to give people equal sentences for equal crimes. I wasn't talking about whether the crimes or their initial sentencing were fair. If we want to have a conversation about increasing the statutory minimums for sexual violence or paedophilia we can, but I made no comments on that front other than in another comment where I said I would be in support of that.\n\n If you want to actually discuss how \"much\" 30 years is, or where the min/maxes for these sentences should be, then I would use actual arguments even though it's not a straightforward topic to empirically litigate. I'd start with pointing out that studies find general samples tend to hand down lesser sentences than the judges when presented with the facts and human-elements of the case, even though they vote for harsher punishes than judges without that context. That's not directly relevant to \"how much\" 30 years is or where the right number is, but it's still indirectly relevant /informative. Judges, on average, are harsher than the general public in their sentencing. People have a tendency to knee-jerk react when presented with the crimes devoid of context or the human complications in the situation.\n\nThe only thing I am trying to preach is that reality is complex and maybe we should chill on the whole \"everyone should be locked away forever\" type beats until we at least understand the context of the situations",

Saying how \"long\" 30 years is didn't really seem like something that could be logically argued or proven, just something you need to experience more or less, but I could be wrong I don't know. In part I am going off my experience from years back when I got a drunk and disorderly and the cops kept me in one of the cells for about 6 hours once I came back to consciousness from the night before. 6 hours in the abstract is nothing to me. But 6 hours staring at a blank wall after being stripped of everything including my clothes, there is literally nothing else to do other than think about what you did. That's the point. Back at that time remember thinking about how they wanted this to affect me and actively resisted self-reflection. I still left being suprised by how much I ended up thinking about my actions and feeling remorse after having everything else to think about taken from me.\n\nI'm not sure how to argue it, but 30 years seems like it would work the same. Not all that much in the abstract - hell even a century or a millennia isn't even that much depending on your framing. But in reality, 30 years of having nothing to do but stare at a wall and think for 23 hours a day is probably a lot different.",

I think this is an under-rated reason for disliking the death penalty.\n\nI'd be uncomfortable being in the kind of society that feels like it can levy the sentence of execution upon its citizens.\n\nThe argument for self-defence is that you typically have no choice because you're coming down to a life-or-death situation already and you're using force to protect yourself. That's fine. However a state-sanctioned execution is _not_ that at all - it's a cold-blooded and unnecessary killing of someone who is in custody.\n\nEven in the case of the worst criminal ever who is convicted with undeniable guilt, you're essentially warping your society into one which pursues revenge and retribution rather than one which is based on moral principles and goodness.",
