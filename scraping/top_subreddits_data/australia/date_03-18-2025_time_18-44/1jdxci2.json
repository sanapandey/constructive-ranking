My body hair is starting to grow in places that push me into older man territory. \n\nThen I realised I haven't seen or eaten a red delicious for a long time. The mental trauma of the fluffy, dry, mealy lack of flavour. I only ever ate granny smiths because of that.\n\nHaving a crisper draw with pink ladies, royal gala, and all the current seedless grapes, especially sweet sapphire, is bloody amazing. Not to mention some of the stone fruit.\n\nOnly complaint is that every pear in the two big shit licker markets is so hard and not tasty",

And the Red Delicious is pretty good for that because there's a large steady demand and you don't lose too much of the crop to bruising and spoilage.",

Short growing season (1-2mo if you're lucky) & liable to disease both on the tree, and in storage. You can still get them from speciality growers but you can't grow them competitively on a commercial scale.\n\nRed Delicious is on the other end of the spectrum, it's got a moderate growing season (4mo) and they store stupidly well. They also used to be better (much sweeter & nicer) and less red. However, marketing a more red apple sells better - so they've made them more red, and made them better for storage which has made them taste worse.\n\nso, basically, capitalism.",
