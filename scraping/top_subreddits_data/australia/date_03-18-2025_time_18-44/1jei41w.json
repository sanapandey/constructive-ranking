            "body": ">A 'terrifying' female teacher who sexually abused a 12-year-old girl left her victim a 'damaged person'. \n>\n>Kellie Ann-Marie Whiteside, 44, pleaded guilty in Brisbane District Court on Tuesday to one count of repeated sexual conduct with a child from 2015 to 2018. \n>\n>Chief Judge Brian Devereaux heard the then-married teacher engaged in sexual acts with the victim, who she at times plied with alcohol, over a three year period. \n>\n>The court heard Whiteside was working as a science teacher in a school south of Brisbane when she turned a friendship with the victim into sexual abuse. \n>\n>Crown prosecutor Cameron Wilkins said Whiteside discussed frustrations in her sex life with her husband and swapped intimate images through Instagram and Snapchat with the victim.\n>\n>'The relationship turned sexual in March 2015. At this time the complainant was still 12 years of age but was soon to turn 13,' Mr Wilkins said.\n>\n>'That relationship ultimately continued past the (victim's) 16th birthday and until it ended in March 2023 when (the victim) was 20 years of age.'\n>\n>Whiteside kissed the victim - who now identifies as non-binary - on school grounds and this led to sex acts committed in soccer club toilets, in car parks and in hotels.\n>\n> \u2026\n>\n>At the time the girl was very vulnerable due to personal issues such as the breakdown of her parents' marriage.\n>\n> \u2026\n>\n>'I was taught about stranger danger ... I was not prepared for a predator to be an adult who was in a position of power ... who was a woman,' they said.",

In relation to gender, there are alpha bias (magnifying gender differences) and beta bias (minimising gender differences).\n>\n>In this chapter we identify another gender bias, gamma bias, which simultaneously magnifies and minimises gender differences. An example is domestic violence, where violence against men tends to be overlooked whereas violence against women is often highlighted. It is argued in this chapter that although we live in times where we now rightly talk a lot about conscious and unconscious bias against women, we are not yet conscious of our biases against men.\n>\n\nSource: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5",
