The for-profit ones were awful to workers which always then impact the children, whereas that was in ratio numbers, facilities, turnover ect. We need to get for-profit centre, our children are too important!",

It\u2019s distressing to say the least and I\u2019ve seen a lot over 33 years of nursing.\nIt\u2019s the same as the aged care system . Backed by equally incompetent regulators and a government who doesn\u2019t care. \nThese people employed here are only here for a visa not because they want to care for children.",

It\u2019s deeply troubling how corrupted these industries have become, leaving vulnerable people at risk.",
