To address that would involve pulling a lot of different types of support, as as eligibility overall.\n\nLike with all the parasitic rorts in our country though, we will have to wait until the nation is fully drained and financially collapses. We still have a decent amount of time left though so I expect this stuff to keep going for at least a decade.",
