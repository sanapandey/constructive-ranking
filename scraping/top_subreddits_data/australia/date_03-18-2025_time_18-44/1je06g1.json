They could have made good tax of f legitimate vapes but did a knee jerk reaction to their mate that owned the therapeutic vape.\n\nSo black market shit disposables became the norm. And have not gone away. \n\nLegal weed would increase quality, lower price and clean up the supply chain while providing a nice tax boost. But when they can't even work the other basics out it will not happen for ages. Just be surprised NSW even got the cannabis caution scheme.\n\nI don't smoke, it doesn't mesh with my fucked up brain. But I fully support legal weed in moderation.",

Bully! Wait, what do you mean nobody buys real durries anymore? See the tax is working ! \n\nAs an EV driver I saw it first hand with the road user tax on EV and PHEV. I have no issues paying a road user tax based on KM, but it was double dipping for PHEV. The only answer is to abolish fuel excise and implement a Federal KM based tax instead (since fuel is Federal, and you can't ascertain if someone travelled over the border).

Sometimes its hard to believe that they are chemists who understand chemistry. \n\nThis kind of condescending attitude is bizarre and prevalent across Australia.  I just contrast  the typical chemist experience in Australia  compared to walking into Chemists in Asia. There the chemists were polite and have a adult like conversation with you about your problem and just sold what was effective without a script. They knew drugs addicts can buy opium or whatever they wanted  down the road and not in their stores and treated customers who were sick with respect. There appears to be a bitter stereotype streak running in the veins of many chemists in the large chains.",

Alot of people at the pubs and clubs are smoking Marijuana.\u00a0\n\n\nThe kinda of people who frequent pubs and clubs as much as they enjoy getting drunk are also going out for the experience. If you legalize weed they will continue to patronize these places in the same capcity. Weed doesn't change that. As much as people are addicted to alcohol they are also addicted to having a good time. That's what people who go to pubs and clubs are really after. Alcohol being there is a bonus for most responsible adults. If you legalzie weed though. People who wouldn't normally go out to the pub or club now may that there subastance of choice is legal. Go to a bar this weekend and hangout outside. See how long it takes to find someone smoking weed. They are already there smoking it. They are gonna a go home cause you legalized it. Just legalzie it and profit .They will just be paying tax revune on the weed they smoke at the pub or club as opposed to smoking black market weed at the pub or club that doesnt benfit the economy.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's also little stopping them from making a pub/club centered around Marijuana as opposed to alcohol. Also tourism. Weed vacation in Australia sells itself. Theres so much you could with legal weed in Australia that would synergize with the nightlife. It would boost those places not take away from them. Australia is such a solid place for weed tourism. Everything about it is perfect. That v8 supercar matural geographic ass country such is a paradise for weed smokers.\u00a0\n\n\nIdk the states whove legalized in America haven't really seen much of a change when it comes to the alcohol industry. The biggest effect legal weed has on substance is opioid use.Seldom do drinkers stop drinking because weed is legal. If anything it's more inventive to go out for a night now that your non drinker friends can easily score some weed without the worrying of being fined or arrested.\u00a0When done right legal weed is always a positive. The taxation can be drink for the consumer but for the populace it's such a slam dunk. Its hard to fuck it up when it comes to the revune. It's not gonna fuck up the bar scene for sure though. There is no part of America where legal weed killed the nightlife scene. It just isn't happening.\u00a0",

And people still will go out to pubs and clubs for a good time. Lord only knows how many people were already hitting some form of non-alcoholic drug at clubs since forever. And in the US, brew pubs are making THC infused beverages to sell to patrons. It's a booming product.\n\nAnd it's cute how he thinks grow operations and retailers will all be small businesses. In the US there are large and dominate grow/retail operations that can choke out any small grower they wish. Nor has legal weed made it any cheaper. People still get their weed from their plug because the legal stuff costs a lot more. Nothing can ruin a good market of a widely popular product faster than the government. The regulations are mostly complex and stringent and the \"sin taxes\" high. Nor are the majority of people interested in growing their own. It harder and more expensive to grow high quality weed than you might think. But if the cost and effort of growing quality weed makes you happy, then I suppose you can have all that's legal to possess.\n\nNow I'm not against legal weed, far from it. I have been known to enjoy an edible now and then. But do NOT make the mistake of thinking you just remove laws against growing and possession and then it's all brownies and pass me the pipe ever after-- it's not.",

These mass grow operations are seldom withholding themselves to purity in the growing process. They are trying to make as much profit as possible and often times they use a bunch of shady tactics. Legal weed is not any safer than black market weed. In fact these corporations who grow all these weed probably use industrial agricultural methods. They arent concerned about quality. The game is quantity. Quality control in legal weed is a joke. Escpially in america where there really isn't a central federal agency to police it efficiently.\u00a0\n\n\nThe corporations in legal weed are not sharing secrets. That is the one huge negative about legal weed. Its not being grown by grassroots folk. It's being grown by billion dollar corporations who are beholden to their stock owners. These people are not growing weed for the love of the plant and botony. They treat like an industrial agricultural product. A company like Monsanto is more akin to these corporations behind legal weed.\n\n\nI'm not saying it's impossible to find a legal grow or dispensary where people msking the decisions are actually passionate about the product but that's very rare in legal weed. At least in america. And even than most of these dispensary are just advertising. They arent being truthful. They still using large amounts of very powerful and volatile chemicals and pesticides and fertlizers.\u00a0\n\n\nLegal weed is just industrial farming. Like what would you trust more. The vegetables at the supermarket? Or ones you grew in your own garden? Legal weed not all that different.\u00a0",

Storefront shops that were cash only. The police did very little; they would be shut down after a few months and another would open up elsewhere. I didn't live in Toronto, but we had a few in my city as well. You could, and still can, buy online and it will be delivered to you. It was really surprising. \n\nOnce it became legal, these shops disappeared for the most part but the system of who was allowed to open a shop was stupid. It was a lottery system by the province of Ontario. It was something like 12 shops total. People sold their spot for a lot of money. A lot of people still bought from illegal shops and their favourite dealers. The legal prices were way too much. \n\nThen COVID happened and this system was gone completely. Shops opened up *everywhere.* There were more weed shop than coffee shops. Imagine walking down a cute downtown street with all it's little shops, stand and look down the streets and you could count three or more weed shops. Indoor malls had weed shops. Some communities (small towns mostly), passed bylaws that didn't allow for marijuana shops. But neighbouring towns would have them and get more traffic. A lot of these shops are NOT profitable. The idea for these companies was simple. They wanted to be the Tim Hortons of weed, the McDonalds of weed, etc. The place everyone thinks of when you think of buying weed. There are a few winners so far, but they aren't making very much in Ontario and many have closed down locations. Prices have also come down with all the competition. \n\nAnd lastly, right now, there are magic mushroom shops opening up in Toronto to buy mushrooms in the same way they had illegal shops selling marijuana before legalization. It will be interesting to see if it follows the same as marijuana.",

                            "body": "The Netherlands is a terrible example. We were ahead once, but our gedoogbeleid is extremely outdated and vague. Cannabis was never legalised. It's illegal to buy and sell, but less than 5g is not enforced. And from that arises a whole host of issues. Like shops having to do sketchy shit to stock product (can't just drive around with kilos of weed, even if it's for business) and growers being criminalised. The supply chain is not taxed properly and because of that there's no regulation.  \nA lot of shops have started doing QA but it's done on a tiny sample and the whole batch is labeled with the same QR sticker containing the test results. This isn't reasonable at all because every variable matters (a lot), light intensity and color spectrum, water and nutrients, harvest time, curation period... All slightly different from bud to bud so you never really know what you have until you test it yourself. There's also the additional difficulty that weed doesn't contain much THC, it contains THCA which is converted when heated (acid gets stripped off). So even with all these things accounted for it's hard to give an accurate number for how much THC will be in your blood after you heat this bud that comes from a batch that contains this much THCA.  \nAnd in traffic they often use cheap breath tests which are notoriously flaky. Will they detect it a day later? Probably. A week? Depends on the person, their diet, metabolism, exercise regime... Also tiny correction, but as your article states if you're found to have multiple of the mentioned substances you're only allowed 1 microgram instead of 3 for THC. Not that it matters because like I said there's literally no way of knowing what your score would be unless you go out of your way to retest your weed before consumption.  \n\nI'd recommend anyone who's worried about blood levels to make tincture or cannabutter and get a home testing kit for both the substance and yourself. The act of preparing the edible makes it so that the one strong bud you got and the other weaker bud in the same baggie cancel each other out and you end up with a homogenous testable substance. Now test that and test yourself after consumption, that's your baseline. Next time you prepare with new weed you test the edible substance again and you can estimate how much THC will end up in your blood based on the baseline. Still not quite accurate though, if you gain weight while consuming a lot of THC you'll store it in fat and release it when that fat gets burned, you can get high months after quitting weed if you're also losing weight. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

Where the risk for our entire nations future has not been so heavily decided since the 1950s. I am not going to risk all of that for a plant. \n\n\nYou are not trying to convince me. I would vote in favour, I just to be frank don't care very much. You are trying to convince 40-60% of this population you care about their values and input enough to let them have a. say. Even if you actually don't, especially if you actually don't.\n\n\nThe USA, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, France, UK and many others have been reeling from the effects of a large portion of voters, especially traditional base voters feeling like they and their values are no longer at the fore of political parties literally founded to cater to them. I care more about the fallout of that then a small number of people having to use a different medication on a Saturday.\n\n\nI wish we lived in a world where you could take your medication of choice on a Saturday, but we aren't there yet and in the lasr decade have been flying away from that future faster than most of us imagined possible.

But the fact of the matter is a lot of people don't and the stakes for elections in the West atm if you haven't noticed are the highest since the Second World War. The absolute safest way forward is for this decision to be done by a vote. If people feel like their values are being bypassed which citizens in a LOT of countries are feeling atm, then we have been shown by the USA and others what the alternative looks like. I'm sorry this is the world we live in but your prescription of choice is not worth all of the risks for me.\n\n\nI am astounded this actually is an election risk thqt could turn an election the way of elsewhere.

A bunch of dispensaries opened up. Like\u2026 a lot. I live downtown-ish Toronto, and for a while there were maybe a dozen dispensaries within a 10 minute walk of me. Market forces came into play, and now there are maybe six or so.\n\nThe model used in Ontario means all cannabis goes through a quasi-government controlled wholesaler. Which means every store has access to the same selection. Which basically means people shop based on price. There are premium/boutique growers who do produce product that might be a smoother or more flavourful smoke/vape, but, for me (and many others, I suspect), even the cheap stuff gets the job done.\n\nI have a dispensary near me which is part of the ValueBuds chain. I believe they\u2019re owned by an alcohol distributor from Alberta, and they\u2019re supposedly running things on zero margin/a loss in order to squeeze out the other players and the indie operators. I can get 10mg edibles for $2, or 3.5g of reasonable quality flower for $20. I\u2019m a lightweight, so a 5mg edible is enough for me for a good few hours. Cannabis hits people in different ways, so other people definitely need more cannabis to get the same impact. My partner will have 60mg-90mg of THC via oil. 900mg of THC via oil costs around $32.\n\nThere\u2019s another dispensary near me that has an amazing selection of stuff, and will stock harder to get items. If I happen to see a review that a current batch of a particular brand/strain is really good, I might go there to try it. I might pay $45 for 3.5g of flower if I\u2019m feeling fancy.\n\nI can also get the same legal product mail order. I can even order it via Uber Eats or other apps.\n\nThere are cape cartridges, various forms of concentrates, things available in capsule form for ingestion, and various other products too. THC or CBD dominant. Or even newer things like CBG or CBN.\n\nPost legalization, people were much more willing to talk about their cannabis consumption at work. It turns out it can be surprising who is a regular consumer of cannabis.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t recall a single news report about, say, a traffic accident where cannabis was a factor. Not one. There are still news reports about drunk drivers causing accidents and killing people.\n\nThe local cops aren\u2019t really big on doing RBT-style tests, so that\u2019s not something that is discussed in the news. As with anywhere, there are plenty of bad drivers here, but there\u2019s nothing in my experience that would make me think that cannabis has made things worse (e.g. someone so stoned they don\u2019t notice the lights had changed to green).\n\nAnd, yeah, post legalization, life went on. A bunch of pot stores opened, you might smell pot a bit more in the streets, and it became more or less socially acceptable to talk about cannabis consumption.\n\nThere is zero reason for Australia to not legalize it. Regulate it, sell it, tax it. Life will go on exactly as it is now, except the government gets tax revenue, organized crime will have to find something new to sell, and the cops can stop hassling non-violent drug users.\n\nAMA.",

If Australia can at least legalize medical cannabis, it will be a major victory for so many of your citizens that you\u2019ll wonder how you ever got by without it. \n\nMy father is in his 60\u2019s and was in a very bad accident two years ago, which has resulted in him needing shoulder surgery and (so far) three surgeries on his neck. He has experienced a tremendous amount of near-constant pain from his injuries and the impact on his quality of life has been immense. He spent his career working with people who have had ongoing issues with addiction to prescription opiates, so he is well aware of the dangers. Cannabis has allowed him to manage his pain about 90% of the time, so that he only has to take his prescription drugs when the pain gets especially severe. \n\nI\u2019ve seen the difference in him when he\u2019s on cannabis versus when he\u2019s on his prescription drugs, and I\u2019m thankful every day that cannabis has been an option for him. The prescription pain meds simply knock him out. He\u2019s barely able to function on them. With cannabis, he can manage his pain, but he\u2019s still able to be present with us. He\u2019s still able to live his life on his own terms and he can still function like a mostly normal person. My dad gets to be present with us and continue to share in all of the experiences that life has to offer. \n\nPLEASE talk to your representatives in government about legalization. It\u2019s a huge way to help a lot of people maintain their quality of life. You have no idea how much this can help a person until you see it firsthand.",

Addiction really is a bitch eh. \n\nIt takes a pretty fucked up person to say someone should get their bed pissed on though simply because they don't think it's ok for other's to purposely and knowingly degrade the health of others. You should take a few moments and actually consider whether you can be a better person... Because, you seem like a horrible person to live with. \n\nIt's wild you're blaming victims and it's obvious by the people who are ignoring the smoking laws that they're not strong enough (there are literally people vaping in trains on a regular basis still as an example. Oh, but that's my fault for using the train I guess). \n\nJust legalise only edibles already and change laws for driving and such to allow people who are under the influence to be charged. That's a very easy argument to make. Legalising more vaping and smoking, that's imho a backwards step that just exposes others to more chemicals",
