Turns out she couldn't swim 50m either - her strokes were good, she was confident enough, but because it's all shallow pools and half or quarter length they never did any distances at all. So despite all the kids going to swim schools in Sydney I completely believe this includes a large number of them too.\n\n(She started doing laps with me, and was easy enough to build up the distance over a few months at least.)\n\nEdit: her school didn't run any swim classes at all, which is what got all of my primary school to a base level of \"not drowning\".  My younger daughter got one week in Year 3, but that was a COVID affected year for my eldest so she missed out.",

If you want anything closer to actual competitive swimming, swimming for fitness or just classes to teach technique for your kids you're better off looking for squad or pre-squad (depending on age) at your local public pool. That'll be closer to your expectations imo.  \n\nIf you live coastal then nippers at your local Surf Life Saving Club is pretty cool too for kids as a sport/organised activity that includes swimming.

Your legs and arms kill you.  The good news is that if you've got that basic level of fitness, give it a few tries and you'll be fine.

If they can't fine, maybe try a lap and a half and then grab the rope. Like, what are they even doing in lessons if you have no issues with your stroke?",

This can be due to sinus issues or just not liking the feel of it.\n\n(Not saying this is the case everywhere. This was just personal experience. The big difference for us is when we bought a house with a heated pool of a decent length. Kids learned to swim like magic. And I fully realise we're privileged for being able to do this.)",

The lesson are 30 minutes, but the kids swim for a maximum of 15 minutes, spend most of the time waiting for other kids to finish their laps before they can do theirs, levels are constantly repeated, my son was stuck in the same level for 4 terms, until I spoke to other parents with the same issues and moved him to another private pool. When talking to family and friends, we all have had similar experiences, it is quite well known that swimming schools are milking parents and kids can barely swim after years of lessons.
