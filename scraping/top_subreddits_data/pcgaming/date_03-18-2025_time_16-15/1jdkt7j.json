Obviously there's some additional similar PC handhelds to group together but still it's not a whole lot of market to justify spending too many resources on hardware that's only getting older.  It's more likely you'd be optimizing to target the tens of millions with older hardware in general not just steam decks.",

The ones people do wish work on steam deck don't (MH wilds) don't play well at all. Switch 2 announced (I know they technically don't compete, but we all know the announcement slowed down sales).\n\nThe next steam deck needs that new FSR tech cause games be looking crusty.",

That said I agree people will become more disappointed as newer AAA titles release like the new Doom come out and it struggles further.",
