I was obsessed with finishing the assassination targets and working through the Objective board with many late nights to see it through. The wait for Ubisoft to bring the series to Japan has been worth it, especially given the technical appeal of modern gaming making it even more impressive than I had imagined. Naoe and Yasuke are my definitive heroes for this series, two individuals who are wonderfully portrayed by their respective actors, and the talented team that brought them to life.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Alparslan G\u00fcrlek](https://opencritic.com/critic/7536/alparslan-g-rlek) - *Turkish* - [84 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/assassins-creed-shadows-inceleme/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows has taken a long-overdue step forward with its new mechanics and technical improvements. You'll just have to overlook the mediocre writing and a narrative that lacks pacing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Jason Flatt](https://opencritic.com/critic/6622/jason-flatt) - [6 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft/)\n\n>It\u2019s a well-crafted game within its own scale with a great story and emotionally resonant characters, but in the grand scheme of what a big open-world RPG could provide, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows doesn\u2019t maximize its potential.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Nick Erlenhof](https://opencritic.com/critic/8745/nick-erlenhof) - *German* - [8.5 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-assassins-creed-shadows-samurai-ehre-trifft-gekonnt-auf-shinobi-stealth/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is the best installment in the series for a long time and brings many fresh ideas to the table. The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k) - [9 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story. Add in the beautiful backdrop of medieval Japan throughout the seasons, and you've got a hit.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cloud Dosage](https://opencritic.com/outlet/951/cloud-dosage)** - [Jon Scarr](https://opencritic.com/critic/11148/jon-scarr) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://clouddosage.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-review/)\n\n>Whether Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is the best entry in the series depends on what you enjoy. If you enjoy tactical stealth, the game delivers. If you\u2019re more into a challenging combat experience, Yasuke\u2019s overwhelming strength may leave you wanting more.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComicBook.com](https://opencritic.com/outlet/862/comicbook-com)** - [Cade Onder](https://opencritic.com/critic/2098/cade-onder) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Although Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows has some cumbersome flaws that can\u2019t be overlooked, including ones that have been present in the series since its inception, it is a strong action-adventure game that I will likely keep investing in for weeks to come.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComingSoon.net](https://opencritic.com/outlet/845/comingsoon-net)** - [Tyler Treese](https://opencritic.com/critic/65/tyler-treese) - [9 / 10](https://www.comingsoon.net/games/reviews/1939657-assassins-creed-shadows-review-ps5-japan)\n\n>This sprawling epic regularly features gorgeous sights of Japan and incredibly fun gameplay with a newfound freedom of how you approach it. It winds up being the best Assassin\u2019s Creed game in years and a true joy over its 60+ hour journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Court LaLonde](https://opencritic.com/critic/10476/court-lalonde) - [8 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an unexpected amount of player agency against the Feudal Japan backdrop fans of the series have wanted for ages.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/assassins-creed-shadows-307262/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is the culmination of years of evolution in the saga, blending refined action/RPG gameplay with one of the series' most captivating settings. The contrast between Naoe and Yasuke offers distinct playstyles, encouraging variety and experimentation. Stealth mechanics are more polished than ever, while combat, though not as deep as a pure action game, remains fun and well-balanced.\n>\n>Feudal Japan is recreated with exceptional detail, thanks to top-tier artistic direction and a solid technical foundation, benefiting from the departure from old consoles. The seasonal cycle isn\u2019t just aesthetic but adds meaningful gameplay dynamics, keeping exploration engaging.\n>\n>However, some concerns remain. The Animus Hub feels more like an unfinished concept than a true revolution, and the modern-day storyline risks becoming secondary again. Some design choices, like character switching, could have been smoother.\n>\n>Overall, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows delivers an immersive experience that will satisfy longtime fans eager for this setting within the series' lore, as well as newcomers drawn by its Eastern allure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-the-best-since-black-flag-3164004/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed has been fighting to find its identity for over a decade, and thanks to Shadows it's finally rediscovered it. Sure, its combat can be clunky and some story beats felt oddly placed (particularly Yasuke's backstory), but Shadows is exactly what Assassin's Creed needed to prove it still has a beating heart. Whether you\u2019re looking to explore the stunning world of feudal Japan, storm the gates of an enemy castle, or fall in love with the many NPCs that populate its world, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive treat that cements itself as the best Assassin's Creed game since Black Flag.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/63927)\n\n>\"A worthy heir to a venerable lineage\"\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows offers one of the most distinctive stealth and infiltration experiences in the series, thanks to its dual-hero system and richly detailed world. Improved AI, environmental interaction, and the impact of seasons on gameplay make it an immersive experience for fans of stealth and tactical combat. Despite some flaws, Ubisoft Quebec has succeeded in delivering a well-rounded experience that combines the series' authenticity with its innovations.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [3 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/37187)\n\n>The real star of \u201cAssassin's Creed: Shadows\u201d is the visually stunning game world. It impresses with its many details, beautiful weather effects and changing seasons. It is perhaps the most beautiful open game world I have ever experienced. Unfortunately, this spectacular backdrop offers little substance despite the solid gameplay basis. Repetitive missions, boring side activities and a half-baked story leave me unsatisfied overall.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Enternity.gr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/783/enternity-gr)** - [Giannis Archontidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/8646/giannis-archontidis) - *Greek* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.enternity.gr/Article/Games/Reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/93784.html)\n\n>Whether you're a fan of the gorgeous old Assassin's Creed, the new open world, or just joining the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows should not be missing from any library!\n\n-------------\n\n**[Entertainment Geekly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/874/entertainment-geekly)** - [Luis Alvaro](https://opencritic.com/critic/9991/luis-alvaro) - [3 / 5](https://www.entertainmentgeekly.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review-a-stunning-but-exhausting-samurai-fantasy)\n\n>If you\u2019ve been longing for a classic Assassin\u2019s Creed experience, you\u2019ll find moments of brilliance here\u2014but they come with frustrations as well. And if you\u2019ve grown tired of Ubisoft\u2019s copy-paste open-world formula, Shadows won\u2019t change your mind.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Eurogamer.pt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/832/eurogamer-pt)** - [Adolfo Soares](https://opencritic.com/critic/8989/adolfo-soares) - *Portuguese* - [3 / 5 ](https://www.eurogamer.pt/assassins-creed-shadows-review-analise)\n\n>Ubisoft has finally released Assassin's Creed Shadows, after several setbacks. It follows the formula of the series, without taking any risks, limiting itself to delivering a game that is consistent with what fans already know. Naoe is a nice surprise, while Yasuke doesn't seem to know what he's doing here. Anyone who likes the saga will love Shadows, but it's a shame it's not more daring.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Fextralife](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife)** - Fexelea - [8.5 / 10](https://fextralife.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Expansive, detailed and polished, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a fantastic exploration and stealth game with beautiful Japanese aesthetics, somewhat diminished by a thin story, clumsy narrative, and immersion-breaking design choices. Despite this, it's a thoroughly enjoyable entry into the series for fans seeking to explore medieval Japan.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Jakub Paluszek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10596/jakub-paluszek) - *Polish* - [6 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/assassins-creed-shadows-recenzja-gry-rutynowy-otwarty-swiat/z046f0)\n\n>I have experienced quite a few really cool moments while playing Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows, but after 40 hours of playtime all those moments are lost in time like tears in rain. This new Creed has some interesting ideas to shake up the formula, but none of them are good enough to make it count. All in all, any potential for greatness was squandered for yet another opportunity to make a very big game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Lodge ](https://opencritic.com/outlet/927/game-lodge-)** - [Silvio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10917/silvio-diaz) - *Portuguese* - [10 / 10](https://gamelodge.com.br/critica-assassins-creed-shadows-o-reconhecimento-para-a-evolucao/)\n\n>The latest game in the franchise is what it is because it looks back and recognizes everything it has done in its history. It brings together the best of all those years and manages to be a brilliant piece of work in every way. Visually beautiful, engaging and extremely fun, combining so many systems. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the best Assassin's Creed ever made and the definitive Medieval Japan game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant)** - [Matt Karoglou](https://opencritic.com/critic/10492/matt-karoglou) - [9 / 10](https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a spectacular return to form for the franchise, delivering one of the series' more tightly focused historical adventures.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameGrin](https://opencritic.com/outlet/436/gamegrin)** - [Anna Duncan](https://opencritic.com/critic/3106/anna-duncan) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>A game that's not without its issues, but is a great entry in the franchise, and didn't feel the need to cram in a ship to captain.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameffine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/854/gameffine)** - [Uphar Dutta](https://opencritic.com/critic/9127/uphar-dutta) - [80 / 100](https://www.gameffine.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows was supposed to work in the dark to serve the light, but it never managed to step beyond the shadows. It plays it too safe while trying to go back to the roots, but it also goes back on the unwanted systems, including the leveling-based progression. This \u201cone step forward, and two steps back\u201d sentiment makes Shadows just another entry in a long list of Assassin\u2019s Creed games and nothing more.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Patrick Lamers](https://opencritic.com/critic/7468/patrick-lamers) - *Dutch* - [4 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-stapt-uit-de-schaduw/6099-29-1-194)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a great step forward for the series, with an intriguing story, varied characters, and a well-executed - eventhough a little repetitive - medieval Japan setting, making it a must-have for Assassin's Creed fans and open-world adventure lovers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Maciej Bogusz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10595/maciej-bogusz) - [7 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-great-combat-and-stealth-where-plo/ze75b)\n\n>Assassin's Creed: Shadows is a game full of contrasts. On one hand, it offers solid stealth mechanics and a great combat system, but on the other, it features a lackluster storyline and generic exploration. If you're a fan of the series, you'll likely find something to enjoy here, but if you weren't convinced from the start, the combat and stealth may not be enough to win you over.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamer Escape](https://opencritic.com/outlet/452/gamer-escape)** - [Eliot Lefebvre](https://opencritic.com/critic/6542/eliot-lefebvre) - [8 / 10](https://gamerescape.com/2025/03/18/review-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>And that's really the ultimate takeaway. It has a load of really fun parts, a fun gameplay loop, an engaging story, and an earnest effort to split the difference between the various elements of the franchise history. It's a good game! Take these reservations not as a subversion of that fact, but for what they are: Acknowledgement of its limitations.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamer Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/733/gamer-guides)** - [Tom Hopkins](https://opencritic.com/critic/2535/tom-hopkins) - [85 / 100](https://www.gamerguides.com/assassins-creed-shadows/review)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows in a nutshell is a more refined, polished game with more of the same formula. This isn\u2019t a big revamp, nor are there any deep changes to the formula. However, it\u2019s the best the series has been for a while. Fun combat, a pair of genuinely interesting protagonists, and a gorgeous recreation of 16th century Japan mean the flaws are easier to overlook.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gfinity](https://opencritic.com/outlet/803/gfinity)** - [Alister Kennedy](https://opencritic.com/critic/10213/alister-kennedy) - [10 / 10](https://gfinityesports.com/article/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph. Yasuke and Naoe are among the best protagonists the series has ever seen, and the return to stealth gameplay is a massive win for longtime fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Glitched Africa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/687/glitched-africa)** - [Marco Cocomello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2466/marco-cocomello) - [9 / 10](https://www.glitched.africa/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows takes the series to new heights in ways we have been longing for. Ubisoft has delivered the most remarkable world I think we have seen from the studio yet. This, combined with a rich setting, dynamic gameplay styles, and a good balance of action and stealth, makes Shadows the best entry in the series. In many ways, it is going to be hard for Ubisoft to top this.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>An amazing journey that we embarked on in feudal Japan alongside Naoe and Yasuke. The story and gameplay were both thrilling and enjoyable, alongside its massive content, making it undoubtedly Ubisoft's most visually stunning game and the best Assassin's Creed game of the last decade.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Kakuchopurei](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei)** - [Jonathan Toyad](https://opencritic.com/critic/7505/jonathan-toyad) - [70 / 100](https://www.kakuchopurei.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review-kkp/)\n\n>[...] Assassin's Creed Shadow is still a decently fun action adventure-slash-role-playing hybrid (stats, grinding, and all that jazz) if you really need a huge timesink with a ton of money backed onto it. It may not change your mind about the Ubisoft formula of open-world games. \n>\n>But through it all, formulas work because they're comfort food and deliver what is expected while looking darn good and polished doing so, without any fuss. And with a great soundtrack that mixes traditional with contemporary beats & melodies.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Le B\u00eata-Testeur](https://opencritic.com/outlet/943/le-b-ta-testeur)** - [Gabriel Desrosiers](https://opencritic.com/critic/11067/gabriel-desrosiers) - *French* - [9.3 / 10](https://www.lebetatesteur.ca/test-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>This is definitely one of the best games in the franchise. It's a complete game with great improvements, the story is well-constructed, and the player has a lot of freedom in their actions. Without distorting the franchise, I was able to enjoy the game almost as much as the first games. It's not far from equaling Black Flags or the Ezio trilogy.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [9.5 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph. An addictive adventure in a stunningly provocative open world, and an absolute must play.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Manual dos Games](https://opencritic.com/outlet/910/manual-dos-games)** - [Luan Fernandes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10817/luan-fernandes) - *Portuguese* - [9.2 / 10](https://manualdosgames.com.br/review-assassins-creed-shadows-ps5/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a great game\u2014everything that every fan of the franchise has always imagined. With refined combat, breathtaking scenery, captivating characters, and a simple yet very effective storyline, Shadows is undoubtedly an outstanding game. It brings the Japanese setting to life in an excellent way, and I am sure it will earn its place among Ubisoft's greatest games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) - *Italian* - [8.8 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3737/assassin-s-creed-shadows.html)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows succeeds in immersing us in a beautiful medieval Japan, full of activities and missions to be carried out with the character we prefer; the settings, the narrative/cinematic approach, and the stealth gameplay are its strengths, but it's a pity for its too weak connection to the franchise's meta-lore and a sometimes disorienting mission structure. Regardless, if you love the series, action RPGs, or Japanese settings, it is a title not to be missed.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso) - [4 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>While not perfect, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a great ninja simulator and an okay open world game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[New Game Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/405/new-game-network)** - [Alex Varankou](https://opencritic.com/critic/2669/alex-varankou) - [74 / 100](https://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/2851/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Another solid entry for the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers a wonderfully rendered natural world, though it's not as unique as it once could have been. The typical mix of stealth and action gameplay is still enjoyable and is now split between two protagonists, though switching between them can be cumbersome. Fans of the franchise should be satisfied, if not exactly impressed.\n\n-------------\n\n**[NextPlay](https://opencritic.com/outlet/897/nextplay)** - [Jamie Briggs](https://opencritic.com/critic/10648/jamie-briggs) - [8 / 10](https://next-play.com.au/assassins-creed-shadows-review-dont-lose-your-head/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a great entry in the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise and a perfect entry point for newcomers. Its dual protagonists are fantastic and distinct, and while the villains are forgettable, the personal stories of Naoe and Yasuke help deliver a strong narrative. Shadows is visually stunning, with excellent cinematography, beautiful open world, a unique soundtrack and immersive sound design. However, a sparse open world, inconsistent parkour, and a disappointing hideout system, ultimately keep it from reaching true greatness.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Sam Aberdeen](https://opencritic.com/critic/4725/sam-aberdeen) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-assassins-creed-shadows.html)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a formidably big game with a densely packed open-world and great stealth gameplay that should please fans, even if it feels like Ubisoft's formula is starting to wear a bit thin.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Noisy Pixel](https://opencritic.com/outlet/711/noisy-pixel)** - [Azario Lopez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2507/azario-lopez) - [9.5 / 10](https://noisypixel.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a breathtaking evolution of the open-world formula, blending masterful storytelling, refined stealth mechanics, and stunning visuals. With a gripping dual-protagonist narrative and meticulously crafted historical setting, Ubisoft delivers one of the most immersive Assassin\u2019s Creed experiences to date.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Chris Garcia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8410/chris-garcia) - [8.5 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-ps5-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a notable achievement from Ubisoft, offering an experience that both long-time fans and newcomers are likely to appreciate. This latest addition to the franchise is visually stunning, and its refined stealth systems and other enhancements make it one of the best Assassin's Creed games in recent memory.\n>\n>However, the dual-protagonist approach might prove to be divisive. While the concept is innovative, its execution falters in certain areas. The game seems predominantly tailored to Naoe, whose abilities allow her to fully engage with nearly all aspects of gameplay.

Its only flaw is its inability to put Yasuke on the same level as his companion, a minor thing when so many other elements make it a must-have for those interested in the series or the setting.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pixel Arts](https://opencritic.com/outlet/740/pixel-arts)** - [Danial Dehghani](https://opencritic.com/critic/3729/danial-dehghani) - *Persian* - [9 / 10](https://www.pixelarts.ir/review/ac-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is one of the best entries in the series in the past decade.

Born from a shared mission, their partnership forces them to combine their skills, with Naoe excelling in stealth and precision while Yasuke dominates in direct confrontations. The game offers a refreshing gameplay with an immersive story set in a beautiful setting of the coveted feudal Japan. While the AI \u200b\u200bstill has its shortcomings, such as guards not reacting to nearby attacks, Ubisoft seems to have finally found the right direction for the franchise after a series of disappointing titles, ensuring that both veterans and newcomers will find something to enjoy in this Japanese adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PowerUp!](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-)** - [Leo Stevenson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson) - [7.5 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2025/03/19/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ps5-lets-senggoku/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is not a bad game, but it is a flawed one. It's also a beautiful one, an interesting one, a frustrating one, a janky one, a thrilling one and sometimes even a great one. It's a game undone by its own desire to be multiple things all at once.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Quest Daily](https://opencritic.com/outlet/905/quest-daily)** - [Julian Price](https://opencritic.com/critic/10683/julian-price) - [9 / 10](https://questdaily.com.au/review/review-assassins-creed-shadows-ps5/)\n\n>\"Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows doesn\u2019t just capture Feudal Japan \u2014 it immerses you in it.

As such, I envy those who possess the time and willingness to truly indulge themselves.

While some of its elements are a welcome sight, the gatekeeping can feel very offputting at times if you just want to soldier on through the main story. Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is best played when you have a lot of time on your hands to play it.

Unfortunately, Shadows ends up getting in its own way by delivering a compelling story, but not knowing when to trim the fat, a gorgeous overworld that overstays its welcome, and an equipment system that isn't exciting.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Nerd Stash](https://opencritic.com/outlet/884/the-nerd-stash)** - [Julio La Pine](https://opencritic.com/critic/10143/julio-la-pine) - [9 / 10](https://thenerdstash.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-the-revival-of-a-legendary-franchise)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is what you get when you combine the best of the many eras of this franchise, while evolving its open world design to perfection.

The detailed open-world of feudal Japan feels full of life with compelling playable and non-playable characters, and different fighting tactics enrich the combat. But the game struggles to balance its two playable protagonists, and player choices are still inconsequential.

Whether sneaking through shadows as Noae or charging headfirst into battle as Yasuke, the game offers a dynamic experience making every choice feel consequential. With its immersive setting, refined combat mechanics, and an innovative weather system affecting gameplay, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows elevates the franchise in ways that will leave eager players wanting for more. While Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows might follow some familiar gameplay tropes, its execution is far from formulaic. With a wealth of side content, a customisable hideout system, and the promise of a world teeming with historical intrigue and fierce battles, it is clear Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is poised to be one of the franchise's most memorable and impactful titles. Fans old and new alike will find much to love in this stunning and daring chapter in the Assassin\u2019s Creed saga.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Kieron Verbrugge](https://opencritic.com/critic/4101/kieron-verbrugge) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Ubisoft's big, bold swing with Assassin's Creed Shadows mostly connects, proving that it was right to hold off on the Hail Mary Feudal Japan setting until it had honed the series' RPG trappings. Shadows' attempts at new ideas don't all land the same, but it excels in the areas that matter most in these games with a gorgeous, rich and well-researched world to explore, compelling stealth gameplay and a story full of intrigue and fresh takes on historical figures.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Redmond Carolipio](https://opencritic.com/critic/291/redmond-carolipio) - [7.7 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/3/18/reviews/145474-ps5-review-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>I do, however, enjoy that there's still so much for me to do in Assassin's Creed: Shadows. I'm whittling down a short list of raiders known for terrorizing villages during winter and looking into members of a mysterious group \u2026 one of whom I killed while I was on the way to do something else. I also have a lot of a fogged-up map that I would still like to clear up and explore, whether it's to find some lost pages floating around a temple or engage in a meditative minigame to unlock more of Naoe's story. For an experience that featured so much conflict, it's a rare moment of peace.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XGN.nl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/810/xgn-nl)** - [Luuc ten Velde](https://opencritic.com/critic/8359/luuc-ten-velde) - *Dutch* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.xgn.nl/review/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>With Assassin's Creed Shadows, Ubisoft sticks to a familiar formula but executes it brilliantly. Add to that the new weather and season systems, along with the expanded base-building mechanics, and we\u2019re convinced that waiting for an Assassin\u2019s Creed set in Japan was more than worth it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Tavern](https://opencritic.com/outlet/949/xbox-tavern)** - [Ian Wray](https://opencritic.com/critic/11183/ian-wray) - [9.6 / 10](https://www.xboxtavern.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is everything I wanted from the series and more. The world is stunning, the combat is thrilling, and the dual-protagonist system adds so much variety to gameplay. Playing as both characters sometimes feels like experiencing two different games, thanks to their unique playstyles. The deep storytelling kept me completely immersed, and I never once felt bored. For me, it\u2019s an absolute must-play for any fan of the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9.5 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>AC Shadows is the best game in what has been an incredible series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ZTGD](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd)** - [Terrence Johnson](https://opencritic.com/critic/8293/terrence-johnson) - [9 / 10](https://ztgd.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-xsx/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Zoomg](https://opencritic.com/outlet/478/zoomg)** - [Meysam Khalilzadeh](https://opencritic.com/critic/3549/meysam-khalilzadeh) - *Persian* - [9.5 / 10](https://www.zoomg.ir/game-review/404322-assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows has all the necessary features to create an unforgettable experience of adventure as a shinobi and a powerful samurai. Ubisoft Quebec, considering everything that frustrated players in the Assassin's Creed games after Origins, immerses players in Feudal Japan. The game has extraordinary graphics, which are considered the best among all Ubisoft games to date. The game's music, combined well with the story, engages you even more in discovering the truth.\n\n-------------",

People never give it credit for that, but it is genuinely the best ac game as stealth. Personally, I prefer the actual social stealth that they immediately dropped in 2 for a contextual social stealth. The problem with social stealth in general though is that it's incredibly shallow because it's passive by design. I'd like to see assassin's creed shift into a mixture of social stealth and light based stealth system and ditch most of the one man army combat. My tangent aside, Odyssey DID at least do stealth better than pretty much all other ac games. Enemies could feel like they were psychic but that's been a problem most ac games have suffered from, at least at release. Other times they feel half blind.",

It most definitely was not on the level of Baldur's Gate 2. It was the next best thing in an era that was really rough for (C)RPGs, I can agree with that, but it does not even come close to BG2 and PS:T.\n\nDragon Age 2 was a hot mess (with some strong points tbf) and Inquisition was all over the place and a VERY obvious victim of corporate meddling with its complete disconnect between its janky overworld and 6 mission long main story. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Veilguard is a mess as well. The gameplay was fun for about a third of my playthrough, after which I honestly just wanted to see where it was going. But the Dragon Age series was never consistent to begin with, and every subsequent entry ran absolutely batshit wild with the preexisting lore and design philosophy (if any). That's nothing that was introduced into the series with Veilguard.",

It seems like a good game which is always been Ubisoft\u2019s MO. They are very good at mediocrity and to me a game that\u2019s good, but maybe not great is still a game I can really have fun with. I think not playing the game because it\u2019s good but not great is a perfectly reasonable opinion. It depends a lot on how much free time you have and if people are focusing on playing the few incredible games like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, or Split Fiction I think they are perfectly justified in just playing those games. \n\nAs I\u2019m fairly early in this thread I just want to encourage everyone to be kind, respect the opinions of others, and don\u2019t harass the developers.",

            "body": "PC Performance for those that give a shit.\n\n**GamingTrend**\n> It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve played a game on GeForce Now.  Apparently I\u2019ve been missing out, because it looks indistinguishable from the full locally-installed version.  To be clear, I\u2019m reviewing this on a bleeding edge PC, but to get started I jumped in with GeForce now.  As you\u2019ll see in the benchmarking videos below, the data center is allocating an AMD Ryzen 16-Core CPU, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080, and Windows 11 64-bit VM to my instance.  If you unlock it in the GeForce Now menus you can tweak the individual settings to match your visual preferences, or you can just leave it on auto and let the system match the game with the visual quality and bandwidth use you can handle with a smooth outcome.  Turning off that auto setting I did a few benchmarks running in native AA at 4K, using DLSS without Frame Generation at 4K, and finally DLSS with Frame Generation on.  I was able to achieve 30, 60, and 103 for averages, respectively, as you\u2019ll see below.\n\n**Noisy Pixel**\n> To get the general pre-amble out of the way, I played on PC with a GeForce RTX 4080, and everything ran beautifully. I didn\u2019t encounter any game-breaking bugs during my playthrough\u2014just a few oddities here and there, but nothing that pulled me out of the experience. Sure, enemy AI can be cheesed like in any other stealth action game, but the developers added elements like creaky floors and multiple stealth routes. This slowed me down enough when I wanted to remain undetected, so I rarely saw enemies acting haphazardly. I can\u2019t speak for console performance, but if it\u2019s anything like the PC version, it\u2019ll be solid. For audio, I chose the immersive mode, which has Japanese voice acting, and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. It amps up the atmosphere so much that I honestly think anyone who\u2019s even remotely curious should try it out\u2014trust me, it\u2019s worth it.\n\n**Player 2**\n> As for the technical side of things, Shadows ran like a dream on my PC. This is a beautiful game that had me stopping to admire the scenery on more than one occasion. That beauty didn\u2019t seem to affect the framerate of the game either. My gaming rig (4080, i9) ran this at max settings with full ray-tracing in ultrawide and the framerate never dropped below 60. On my lower specced laptop (4060) it still ran beautifully with the only sacrifice being a reduction in ray-tracing effects and 1080 resolution. This feels like a very stable and optimised release, with only the very occasional graphics bug, usually something to do with flowing hair or clothes, rearing its head to break the illusion.\n\n**SECTOR.sk** (Translated)\n> From a technical point of view, the game works on PC without any major problems, the performance is very decent despite the added Ray tracing, a lot of effects and denser vegetation. Optimization seemed seamless to me, everything was smooth at least on the RTX 4080. I can't speak for everyone, but you can see how the delays helped, and everything is well-tuned. Now there are also modern features such as DLSS, FSR, XeSS and Frame Generation, although without directly integrated Multiframe generation yet. As for performance, with DLSS at maximum in 4K, the RTX 4080 gives around 60 fps and with frame generation around 100 fps. \n\n**Wccftech**\n> Experiencing Assassin's Creed Shadows at its best, however, has a cost, and only the most powerful system configurations are able to run the game at maximum settings, full ray tracing, and native 4K resolution at 60 FPS. Thankfully, the game scales really well across different system configurations, sporting a great variety of visual settings to tweak with a handy preview that highlights how each setting affects the visuals. At 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS Quality and Frame Generation, and the settings in the screenshots below, the game ran extremely well on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) with no visible stuttering, often hitting the 120 FPS mark, except for cutscenes, which are sadly locked at 30 FPS to retain a cinematic feel. The in-game benchmark also returned excellent results with unlocked framerate, hitting an average of 117 FPS, 99 1% low, and 93 0.1% low. Seeing the essentially bugless high level of technical polish on display here, there's little doubt that delaying the game multiple times was definitely the right choice, one that more publishers should consider to deliver solid PC ports.\n\n**VideoGamer**\n> A quick word on performance. My first couple of days with Shadows were beset by excruciating stuttering issues, the game slowing to a staccato crawl. These caused a crash or two on a machine that exceeded the minimum system requirements by a good margin and despite dialling down the more demanding graphical settings. But, a chunky patch swooped in, eradicating the problem entirely. It\u2019s been smooth playing ever since: steady frame rates, short load times even when darting from one corner of the map to another, and, again, consistently gorgeous landscapes and visuals. Hopefully, this applies to most players.\n\n**PC Gamer**\n> I still rock a 2080 Super in my home PC, so I was cautiously optimistic about how Assassin's Creed Shadows would perform based on its surprisingly reasonable system requirements. At medium settings, 1080p, and raytracing features set to their minimums, I hovered around a comfortable 60 fps target often enough that I didn't feel a need to babysit a frame counter\u2014a nice change of pace from a string of games like Avowed, Indiana Jones, and Stalker 2 giving my aging rig a hard time. Read our full [Assassin's Creed Shadows performance analysis](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-performance-analysis-ray-tracing-upscaling-and-frame-generation-are-all-optional-but-only-two-of-them-are-worth-using-though-not-the-ones-you-might-think/) for a wider view on its performance on a variety of hardware.\n\n**The Games Machine** (Translated)\n> Played at 2560\u00d71440. With all details set to \u201cHigh\u201d, ray tracing effects on \u201cMedium\u201d and DLSS on \u201cQuality\u201d it barely maintains 60 FPS, however with the frame generation technology enabled I was able to play at around a stable 90 FPS. \n\n**CD-Action** (Translated)\n> Technically, it's really hard for me to do anything The graphics are pleasing to the eye, especially when the game has spring or winter, and the locations \u2013 although they sometimes offer similar views \u2013 have been designed in detail and interestingly. In large details everything fell out pleasantly and maybe only once or twice I experienced texture loading from close. The rest was rendered without problems and the range of view allowed admire the views. Optimally I must admit that I am very positive surprised. We're still running around the Animus while loading or fast travel, but the loading time is extremely short. The game also held steady 60 frames and my machine didn't heat up at all (which happens with other titles). I played on RTX 4080, 24 GB RAM, Ryzen 7 on 8 cores - none it's a performance demon, and it did a great job.\n\n**IGN Turkey** (Translated)\n> Occasional FPS drops and minor animation glitches can ruin the immersion, especially in large-scale battles. The gameplay is smoother than many of Ubisoft\u2019s games, but there are still some annoying little glitches. Additionally, the sheer size of the world can sometimes feel like it\u2019s bloated with filler activities that don\u2019t add meaningfully to the experience. The game runs well on current-gen consoles and high-end PCs, but there are noticeable performance hits on older hardware. Shadows received a major 12GB update two days after I started playing, but I couldn\u2019t see any significant difference. \n\n**4P.de** (Translated)\n> is PC performance impressive, though a sufficiently powerful computer is required. On the test system with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, 4K rendering at 60 frames per second is almost effortless . At least with the help of DLSS, which is set to balanced. With Frame Gen, even 90 FPS is not an insurmountable hurdle. The new version of the Anvil engine is impressive, with the exception of facial animations and hair rendering. One downside: the cutscenes are limited to 30 FPS. \n\n**PC Games** (Translated)\n> On PC, the sleek graphics require very decent hardware requirements. Anyone who wants to be able to use all options at their best possible settings needs a computer with the latest hardware. Everyone else will have to be prepared to make compromises. However, the diverse options offer a lot of potential for this. I recommend using a controller if possible. The game is clearly designed for this. Controlling with a mouse and keyboard takes some getting used to. \n\n**GRYOnline.pl** (Translated)\n> I played Shadows on a laptop with fairly powerful components (i9-13980HX and RTX 4080), so I didn't have to worry about smoothness at 1440p , although the game sometimes tended to crackle, especially in the base, so for the most technical details, I refer you to the technical review on Futurebeat, which will be up on Wednesday. During the entire game, I encountered one crash to the desktop without any message (fortunately, autosave saved my progress), and the frequency of cosmetic glitches like broken fabric physics or a horse going crazy is in line with Ubisoft standards , meaning we can play for 5 hours and not notice anything, and then something goes crazy every now and then for 30 minutes.",

            "body": "To be entirely honest as soon as an Assassin's Creed game set in Feudal Japan was announced, I immediately knew for a fact that it was going to be a mediocre experience. I didn't know that because I knew that it was going to be a bad game, but because I knew that there are already very good feudal Japan games out there, from many genres, and I was highly doubtful that Ubisoft, with their known laziness these last few years, was going to bring anything new to the table or do something better than the other games. \n\nNow don't get me wrong I absolutely love Origins, Odyssey & Valhalla, but that is because the story in all 3 of them I thought were fantastic, the environments rather novel in video game settings. Japan though ? There is nothing original about anything in regards to it. Better Feudal Japan stories have been told, better gameplay in Feudal Japan games have been told, and better exploration aswell. So what exactly is going to stand out about Shadows exactly ?\n\nOrigins and Odyssey you could see the effort that the devs had put in from mile away and there was clear passion about it. Valhalla too mostly even if I did notice a downward trend compared to the previous 2 in some questionnable game designs. After more than 4 years since Valhalla and all the reports, scandals, controversies and mediocre games released from Ubisoft since then, I genuinely didn't think that doing a feudal Japan setting for an Assassin's Creed game was ever going to be any good, because Ubisoft had clearly run out of ideas when it comes to Assassin's Creed once again, and the feudal Japan choice felt 100% like a business decision due to how popular feudal Japan games released in the last few years and since had been, and how fans of Assassin's Creed had been pushing for a feudal Japan setting for over 10 years.\n\nAll in all if I'm perfectly honest this could have been an exceptionnal Assassin's Creed game if another time period, one seen far less in games media about Japan, had been chosen. If the game had been set between the years 1850 & 1900 where tensions between foreigners and shogunate and growing imperialist movements had been rising and on the verge of exploding, with guns being available, then it could have been an exceptional game. Imagine playing one or multiple Assassin's set in the late 1800's, men or women, assassinating westerners thinking that you're saving your country from them and the templars at the same time, yet inadvertedly leading to the rise of imperial Japan and the wars of conquest that followed, ultimately seeing your character, close to dying of old age, seeing the nuclear bomb dropped in one of the two cities and dying to the blast because you weren't far enough from the epicenter. \n\nIf Ubisoft had this story instead, then I would have bought the most expensive physical collector's edition for it.",
