            "body": "Hello, I'm getting frequent freezes on my laptop. I recently changed the RAM on it from 8 GB to 32 GB (corsair DDR4), the first day it was running great, and then afterwards the freezing started.\n\nThe laptop freezes every 5 minutes or so. It doesn't matter whether I'm running a game, calculator, or web browser; the freeze is the same and only lasts about 1-2 seconds. I never had this freezing issue on the laptop with 8 GB of RAM.\n\n(Can this also be related to storage issue, I have very less space on my SSD(around 8gb), my paging is set to higher than the SSD space I currently have)\n\nSpecs: Cpu Ryzen 5 5600h, GPU Rtx 3050, Laptop: Dell G15 5515, OS Windows 10",

Free up at least 40GB, even if that won't fix freezes it will improve non-gaming performance.",

                    "body": "Hi. You might have broken something while disassembling the laptop. Or the fan might be stuck.\n\nFirst. This is likely not the cause of the freezes, but it's worth trying: set the minimum and maximum page file size to, for example, 4 GB.\n\nSecond. Download the OCCT program for stress testing. It's free for home use. In it, go to Stability Test - Memory - Start. If there's a problem with the RAM, after some time you will see error messages in the top left of the test window. Either the program will simply close, or the laptop will restart or show a blue screen.\n\nEven if the memory is fine, look at the monitoring results on the right. Uncheck all boxes and check the items \"CPU CCD1\" (CPU temperature), \"Core 0 Clock\" (frequency of one of the CPU cores). If the temperature is above 90 degrees Celsius or you see drops on the Core 0 Clock graph during laptop freezes - the laptop is overheating, and you need to take it to a service center for diagnosis and repair.\n\nIt's also possible that in the Core 0 Clock graph, the processor frequency *during testing* will not reach the standard 3300 MHz for the Ryzen 5 5600h, but will always be lower - this could indicate that the laptop has a serious malfunction and definitely needs repair. In any case, such a problem cannot be solved at home.\n\nOne more thing about the free space on your SSD: free up as much space as possible. While freezes shouldn't necessarily happen just from low space, due to how SSDs work, especially cheap ones, you need to keep at least 30% of free space for data to be written quickly. Perhaps the standard Disk Cleanup, which you can find in the Start Menu, will help you free up at least a few gigabytes.",

I have it set to change every 5 minutes(with transition). I noticed this back on 8gb too, whenever the wallpaper transitioned, it would always freeze my PC for a few seconds. \n\nI thought that it was a memory issue, and turned up the quality settings on it to high after changing RAM\n\nI am really sorry for wasting your time, this is something I should've realized sooner",

                    "body": "Obviously, clean up your sdd before doing anything, to make sure your paging file it not shitting itself due to low disk space. Also, consider getting some benchmarking or testing software, like OCCT, Cinebench etc. The former have RAM-specific tests, so might be a good fit.\n\nAs for any possible hardware causes, this might be a RAM frequency issue: in many cases MB cannot support max frequency if more than one memory bank is in used, in which case you can try lowering the memory frequency. Start low, make sure the freezing are gone then slowly raise it until you'll start getting freezes again then lower back 10-15%. After each change, boot back and run the RAM tests or general PC benchmarks with whatever took you'll be using. Make sure there are no errors or freezes.\n\nAlso might be a voltage problem, in which case you can \\*\\*carefully\\*\\* raise it a bit but be careful as this is a bit risky, esp if you don't have a good cooling solution in place. You may fry your ram if you do something wrong here so read the manual carefully and only tweak voltage at your own risk.\n\nMemory timing is not as likely IMO but check what is recommended config for that amount of ram.\n\n  \nEdit: spelling",
