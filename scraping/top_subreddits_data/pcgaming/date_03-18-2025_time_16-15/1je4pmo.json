Around 80fps on DLSS Balanced.\n\nFor framegen, 2x looked the best. 3x and 4x has some noticeable artifacts. at 1440p 2x framegen and DLSS balanced gave around 140 fps and very useable 35-45ms PC latency on the nvidia overlay.\n\nAfter looking at benchmarks i thought it might be rough, but its running really good so try it yourself. if u have 4070ti super or better, i think you'll have a good experience at 1440p with dlss. Also no shader/traversal stuttering like a lot of modern games, it still does have the few seconds loading at set points in the level though like the original HL2.",
