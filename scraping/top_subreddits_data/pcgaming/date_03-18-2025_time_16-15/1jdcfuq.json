It\u2019s not much of a leap for discord and the 3 major game platforms on pc to share .exe files and FTP forwarding. In fact none of the would even change what they\u2019re currently allowed to do under their Microsoft Development suite, they can already do this without updating ToS\n\nEdit : I meant API not FTP, my phones autocorrect got to it before I noticed. Discord reads your computers memory, it also has an API that allows it to interface with other companies, my whole point is that this isn\u2019t hard to imagine, this is a literal switch. Whether or not you activate the invite through discord, they\u2019ll still have the information and it\u2019ll still be bloat that\u2019s packed and constantly running on your machine. I understand the typo probably the reason for downvotes, but I assure you you don\u2019t have to make things up to understand how invasive modern programs are on your computer lmao.",

Maybe you need extra funding for a specific venture you want to establish under that company's direction. The easiest and fastest way to do that is to sell off ownership shares of your company. \n\nBut it's a Faustian bargain because shareholders expect returns on their investments. Typically they're impatient for these returns as well, thinking in 3 months blocks because financial quarters conditioned us and society to work that way. \n\nTack on the fiduciary obligation that CEO's and other company leaders are legally bound to. And all of a sudden that company is doing everything it can to raise profit margins by a 3 month deadline every 3 months or they can get sued by shareholders for not conducting business in the best interest of shareholders.  \n\n\nI think abolishing the fiduciary obligation would be a step in the right direction.

Everything starts in discord first, its main hub to connect with other people and come up with some plans. After we decide what we want to play we just have to use steam/bnet/uplay/whatever, while still being in discord. Its just annoying additional step that i have to take to play with people im already in contact with. Even when i play something like CS/OW2/League and random people add me on those platforms, first thing they ask is my discord name, because its much more easier and convenient way to communicate. So if more developers adapt discord sdk and let us bypass obsolete systems like steam friends or bnet friends, thats a massive win in my book",
