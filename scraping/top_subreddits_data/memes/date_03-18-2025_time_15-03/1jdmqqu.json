He and my aunt were taking their 4 children (who were all under the age of 10 at the time, with the youngest (who's adopted) being handicapped due to shaken baby syndrome and sometimes has behavioral issues because of it) to Disney World for a family vacation. Airport security can be stressful when you're traveling alone. But when you've got four young children to wrangle, it's even worse. So, of course, my uncle was sweating. And TSA pulled him aside for a patdown and hand swab and kept asking him why he's sweating so much and if he's nervous about something. He's white and grew up in the Mid West US, too, so he doesn't have a foreign accent or was being targeted for his race or anything.",

When I was on SSRIs, I had the common side effect of being more affected by the heat and UV rays. During that time, I actually did lose some of my heat tolerance, so I can empathize with people who don't do well even more than before since I sort of get it now.  But they tend to refuse to understand/empathize with those of us who don't like the cold and claim their comfort is more important because they have a solution that works for them, not caring if it works for us.

A few cups of, being generous here, 34 degree F water will cool your body down, but not by very much. It has 100 or (substantially) more pounds of nearly 100 degree F mass it needs to cool down, which is made even harder to cool since 2/3 of it is water, a potent heat sink. For water to cool you adequately on a very hot day without sweating, one would need to consume more water than is really healthy. And, it\u2019s a well documented fact that the effectiveness of evaporative cooling is inversely correlated with air humidity levels. Air can\u2019t absorb water if it\u2019s saturated, which means sweat doesn\u2019t evaporate and no evaporative cooling takes place. Even at 40% humidity levels, there is a substantial decrease in the body\u2019s ability to cool itself.",

Winter is absolute hell up here in the north and I have never found a pair of gloves capable of keeping the cold out of my hands.\n\n2. I despise bulk. I hate bulky clothing with a passion. Loose? That\u2019s fine, but if there\u2019s too much I start to feel claustrophobic. Scarfs and hats are almost always a no for me, as are gloves despite reason number 1. I mean, I\u2019ll wear it if I must (again, I live in the north, I know when to suck it up) but I hate it. Don\u2019t have to layer up when it\u2019s warm. In fact, I can basically layer down!",

Even though it doesn't get super hot in the summer here in Norway, I'm usually sweating buckets when the temperature outside is around 20-25\u00b0C or slightly lower than that, so the summer has almost always been my least favorite season.

However, snow is only fun for a few minutes until you\u2019re too cold to have fun anymore, and then you have to thaw out, which is painful. And don\u2019t pull the whole \u201cyou can just put on more layers\u201d because no amount of layers can protect you from the cold without impairing your movement. It will find a way through.\n\nNow, hot weather is actually pretty manageable. If you have AC or enough fans, you can stay inside, but there are plenty of ways to stay cool outside, most of which involve water. Swimming, water balloons, water parks, nice cold drinks!",

Because technicalities don't actually matter in language. Ignorance is absence of knowledge, silence is absence of sound, darkness is absence of light, nobody fucking cares, because nobody is saying that cold isn't absence of heat. We live in a world in which the normal temperature is perfect for us. that for us is Room temperature, where our body feels perfect, then if it is colder or hotter, we will experience both very differently, because we can sense things, meaning, even our body pretty much acknowledges the existence of Cold. Words exist to describe perceived phenomena. Words are meant to represent things. Cold represents absence of heat. The word Cold helps us communicate. Cold as a concept is real.
