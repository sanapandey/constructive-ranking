I consider myself a leftist - communist, specifically, and proletariat solidarity is explicitly stated to be a core tenet of socialism, as was explained in The Communist Manifesto. To say that leftists have a positive view on billionaires is in direct contrast with the tenet.\n\nRegarding the right, while I do think that there is a small minority that wish for the preservation of billionaires, I have hopes that most don't like them - instead, they just want free markets without monopolies.",

Ideologies within that deal with both social and economic problems, like how communism's social problem is class solidarity and class antagonism.\n\nLiberalism too is a socioeconomic ideology, but it's on the right - it still desires free markets and capitalism, just without the elites. Liberalism, of course, has positive perspectives on social issues, like minority rights and women's liberation.\n\nDo leftists and liberals tend to agree on social issues? They can, and, in my experience, often do, but their economics are VERY different.",
