When I asked, they reminded me that the last option was always 'D' and the bubble sheet had an extra bubble.\n\nI spoke to the prof and told him any 'E' I marked was meant to be a 'D' and I had just filled the last bubble automatically, because it was the last option on the answer sheet. He refused to accept it, but then also acknowledged that, had I filled them in as 'D', I would have been the first and only person to ever get a 100% on his exam.",
