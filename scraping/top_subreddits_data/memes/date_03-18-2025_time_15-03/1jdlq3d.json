                    "body": "Speaking as someone who worked on a word processing web app for a B2B tech company for several years, yes it is actually that hard. On the flip side, all the hard stuff was worked out years ago by our forebears so if people wanted it to be perfect, we could do it (we still love you, Reveal Codes, in a different world you live on). But on the other flip of the flip side, \"good enough\" apps that have lots of bugs but have won the economic side of app popularity get to set the standard and everyone else follows them. So Word-compatibility is worth millions and anyone who wants their company to be successful has to replicate Word's bugs down to the pixel. Same with Chrome as a browser. Most people don't even know how much money has been wasted ensuring our apps comply with the bugs those two platforms promulgate. But this is the world in which we live. Sorry.",

I don't remember how exactly to use them, but I'm pretty sure you can use them to make sure things stay aligned properly. \n\nI'd recommend spending 10-15 minutes playing around with those settings and Googling what they do. This is likely something chatgpt would be helpful for learning about if you ask good questions. \n\ne.g. Don't just ask \"Why is my formatting being messed up in word?\" Ask something like \"In a word doc, when I inserted the last image X happened when I wanted Y.
