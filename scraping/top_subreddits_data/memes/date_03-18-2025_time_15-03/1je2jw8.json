I lived in Italy for over 5 years and still tipped because I had friends that were servers making minimum wage, not a good living wage like people have been brainwashed to believe. I guess if minimum wage is refreshing, it makes sense for you to think it\u2019s refreshing.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s amazing to me how ignorant and selfish people are on this topic. Removing tipping from industries that use tipping only keeps workers net wages down. \u201cBut they only make 2.83 an hour in some cases.\u201d Yea, maybe from the restaurant, but there is no ceiling on net wages. Removing tipping inherently installs a ceiling on wages. And that\u2019s usually $15/hour on the high end. The federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour so that will likely be where a lot of people end up that don\u2019t have bargaining power.",

On a regular week night I made between $100 to $150 in a 6 hour shift, the equivalent of $16 to $25 an hour. On weekends I made around $300 in a six hour shift, equivalent to $50 an hour.

Well if everyone is handing out free money you might as well see if they'll hand it to you.
