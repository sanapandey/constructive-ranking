            "body": "Well, I guess we finally have a motivation and while it's something that I thought of as a possibility, I personally feel the show didn't really earn it. So Valt wants to save Myralis by destroying the orbs because they are keeping history on its path by making sure she dies as she is supposed to. I get that idea, but aside from the fact that he has no idea if that truly works (and he makes sure he won't have a second chance), I just feel it wasn't really built up well.\n\nFirst and biggest issue is Oscar imo. Oscar was saved by the orb being used and so far, the orbs have not shown any attempt at killing him. And while there might be some explanation behind that (like how him being cursed was enough for the orbs to keep him around or his mother dying as some form of compensation instead) the question obviously arises, why can't Valt just do whatever it was that kept Oscar safe? Would he have to die and he also doesn't want that to happen? Is that the issue?\n\nSecond problem is that his plan just feels overly complicated. In this timeline, he did so many things just to get Tinasha ready and \"test\" if she was powerful enough, but what about all the other ones? Did he never ask Tinasha and Oscar if it would be a good idea to get rid of these orbs? Even when he was very close to them? I get, witch Tinasha is a bit different in personality, but I just don't see her or Oscar being that against that idea in principle. Especially since the obvious argument could have been that the orbs might destroy their relationship that they built.\n\nMy only other idea is that Valt just got tired in this timeline and wants to make sure there never is one again because he realised even if he doesn't jump back, someone else might (in this case Oscar) and he has to basically see Myralis dying over and over again (since he remembers). So instead of trying to prevent it, he just never wants to see it again. But even with that, his plan in this timeline just feels a bit too overcomplicated.\n\nAbout the fact that Tinasha seemingly really wanted to stop her wedding (which they mentioned in passing last week, but I just thought it was Oscar being overly cautious) I don't even want to talk anymore. They really try to even ruin the one thing that the show had going for it (the Oscar-Tinasha romance) by again leaving out important information about this relationship that we just have to fill in ourselves.",

            "body": "Valt isn't forthcoming about why he needs both orbs, but he is straightforward about how Oscar has been screwing up the one rare instance of Tinasha being in love with him from the get-go instead of him having to constantly woo her for once. Oscar may fall for other women in other timelines, but Tinasha has only ever loved him in EVERY timeline. And it's in this one where he's dedicated to saving her.\n\nTuldarr vs Magdalsia! With Tinasha on their side, Tuldarr has the distinct advantage, but Magdalsia has \"Lucrezia\" backing them up. Although I love how Tinasha is in all serious, life-and-death, battle mode and then Oscar calls in and she gets all flustered. \n\nTurns out it's not Lucrezia at all but the king of Magdalsia using her body! And while Tinasha has had to go through so much alone and take on the responsibility of Tuldarr without any help, now she has Oscar to shoulder the burden with her so she doesn't have to bear it all alone anymore. That's what being married is all about, right?\n\n\"It's no fun to torment a man\" - That's how you know for sure this is definitely not Lucrezia. \n\nSo Lucrezia's been trapped with Senn in a magic mirror, the Mirror of Oblivion, and now she and Tinasha finally meet! Though I'm kind of curious about Lucrezia's history with Senn now.\n\nI love how Lucrezia is back in her body and she's already into OscarxTinasha again even though she barely knows them in this timeline. Also she seemed really surprised at the prospect of Lavinia having sex, let alone having blood relations with Farsas royalty.\n\nSo all's well that ends well. Lucrezia kills the king who stole her body, Tinasha isn't worried about Oscar cheating on her, the engagement is still on, and Tinasha is finally going to step down from being queen of Tuldarr so Legis can take over and she can finally be free.\n\nExcept Valt still has one last revelation to throw Tinasha's way, a reveal of her past as the Witch of the Azure Moon, and that Tuldarr existing and her status as not being a witch is something that never should have happened. And Valt is willing to eradicate Tuldarr and restore the timeline if it means Tinasha helping him get the orbs and destroy them. Which will somehow save Miralys, I guess!?",

Is that right?\n\nIf that's the case ... why not simply *ask* Tinasha and Oscar for help? I don't see why they wouldn't happily agree to ram Akashia through both of the timefuckery orbs and be done with them? I doubt they would be unhappy to be rid of them? \n\nAlso, why did Valt feel the need to strengthen this Tinasha by having her absorb that dark snake-god again? He doesn't exactly gain anything from her being stronger, does he? \n\nAlso also, did anyone understand what the quarrel between Tinasha and Oscar was even about? I seriously don't understand what they were 'fighting' about only to arrive to the same conclusion as before, that they will get married? \n\nSeriously, this show is such a hot, disjointed mess it's almost impressive. And somehow they have managed to degrade the one thing that has been holding it (loosely) together, that being Tinasha's and Oscar's relationship. Season 1 was seriously better than this - yes, it was also a rushed mess, but somehow things felt like they made more sense, and the relationship between Tinasha and Oscar was both further along and better executed, with better interactions between the two, at this point in the season. \n\nJust ... ugh. It's been a while since I have felt so *disappointed* in a show.

I have technically an idea, but it's just a random guess. Basically, he doesn't think destroying the orbs saves Myralis but destroying them means, no one can ever use them again. Which in turn means that he never has to see her die again as he remembers every time that happened. So when he died last time and Oscar reset the timeline instead of him, his plan now became to destroy the orbs instead of using them further. But tbf, that is a complete guess.",

A bit sad Lucrezia is being mind controlled it seems. Disgusting king taking over her body. Hope he gets punished harshly. Their \"not your wife/queen of Tuldarr/want to be wife/whatever\" back and forth does get a bit annoying tbh. Maybe less so if things weren't blatantly skipped. \n\nLucrezia looks smoller in the mirror. Cute. Hope you get fucked, shitty king dude. You are absolute scum. So Lucrezia killed the scum, good for her. That war sure was fast though. \n\nOh my, Tinasha into some kinky kidnapping roleplay \ud83d\ude09  I do wonder, when she was queen long ago, she clearly had no kids, who was the family that took over? What other family? \n\nValt really is a shit. Seriously, why Oscar didn't deal with him when at the start of the episode is ridiculous. You really sure spew a lot of bullshit to justify being a shit. You really don't deserve to save that girl. Especially since she's complacent in this. And she's no sinner, only you are. He is insufferable. He really coulda gone about this a better way I bet.",

Oscar just freely telling her that he's the grandson of a witch is a bit wild, but I suppose she's probably not going to go tell anyone.\n\nInteresting to learn that this was apparently the one single loop where Tinasha didn't end up a witch compared to possibly thousands of them in which she did. \n\nValt wanting to destroy the orbs of time fuckery may actually be a good idea, as long as it leaves the existing timeline in place and we don't have to start over yet again.",
