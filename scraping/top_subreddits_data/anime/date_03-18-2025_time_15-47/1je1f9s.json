Well, they could've put in the most budget for the first episode - that's always a possibility too I guess.\n\nKinda cool to see [characters from 0079 mentioned](https://i.imgur.com/fWy3i4w.jpeg) as well. Even if Zeta is a direct sequel, seeing old names again is nice nonetheless. [Minor spoiler?] >!Apparently Char is still one of the MCs of this season based on what I saw on MAL, which is pretty hype to see!<.\n\nKamille is... well. I guess it's a bit early to judge the guy but it does seem like Tomino is quite fond of making the MCs be rather irritating at the start of their journey. Like, [for example ep 1] >![this guy comes in to save him from space jail](https://i.imgur.com/yPNj0t5.jpeg) and then [he pretty much *immediately* starts beefing with the military officer](https://i.imgur.com/75WeJTz.jpeg) again!< lol. I do hope he gets better over time like Amuro did.\n\nu/Shimmering-Sky",

I *do* want to eventually host a full run of it, but that probably won't be until it's the franchise's 50th anniversary or something like that.\n\nZeta was included in [the full UC rewatch that was before my time on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rewatches/rewatch_archive/2016#wiki_kido_senshi_gundam_uc) too though, in case you wanted to read some of those.\n\n>That took me longer than expected because I was trying to search with \"flair:Rewatch\" in the search bar and that one (I'm guessing) is before the flair even existed.

Had initially come up with this system to sort out which shows I'd like to watch, anyways.\n\n> I can't remember ever having so many shows combined on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIt's certainly nice to have a couple of shows at the start of the week. Though, I'm somewhat surprised that you're planning to watch The Shiunji Family Children. It might be Doga Kobo, but that anime's premise is one big red flag.\n\n> Iirc you start giving scores for seasonals before they finish airing, probably better if you hold off with that this spring\n\nWasn't planning to do so until at least all my shows had entered their third episode, which would've marked the end of my initial proposal for this little game - or do we want to extend this until the end of spring?\n\n**About the game's setup**: was thinking that we'd only include the anime titles that we are *all* watching, since you cannot make accurate estimates if you haven't seen the show yourself. If we all got our PTW lists ready, I can try and find the commonalities.\n\nDo we want to do any scoring for getting things right? If so, I was thinking of the following:\n\n- 5 points for a precise ranking\n- 2 points for any show within 1 space up or below\n- 1 point for any show within 2 spaces up or below\n- 0 points for any show 3+ spaces up or below",

It might be Doga Kobo, but that anime's premise is one big red flag.\n\nYou're completely right, initially wasn't planning to check this out, but I really liked the character designs in the latest KV so I thought why not. Definitely should have marked it red though, probably won't stick with it too long thanks to the premise. On that note, I was also surprised that you *aren't* planning to watch Chuuzenji-sensei and Anne Shirley, would have guessed you'd pick them up. Any particular reasons or just no room anymore?\n\n> or do we want to extend this until the end of spring?\n\nPersonally I don't think it's necessary to wait until the whole season is over, but I'd be in favor of extending the game until the 5-6th episodes of each show have aired, rather than only the first ~3.\n\n> was thinking that we'd only include the anime titles that we are all watching, since you cannot make accurate estimates if you haven't seen the show yourself\n\nHaven't thought about that, but true, only really makes sense if we do it this way.\n\n> I was thinking of the following:\n\nSounds good to me! Was thinking, are we only gonna put them in a descending order from good->bad, or do we also want to assign 1-10 scores that we believe each one would give it at the time? Though that might make the whole thing a bit too difficult to guess accurately, not sure.",

It is also the best anime that the studio making it has ever made, but the bar is low - that studio is on the level of Typhoon Graphics, no joke. \n\nI adore the OP, tbh.

They behave the way they do because they believe that having a preference for dubs is an existential threat to some essential quality of \"non-westerness\" in anime, and thus consider those who prefer dubs to be an existential threat to anime. That fear is why they act that way. They keep making the same arguments because it's basically all they have. They know you've heard it and they're gonna keep saying it until you \"understand\" it, because if you don't \"get it\" then anime is supposedly going to keep appealing to western sensibilities, localize all the \"anime\" out of it, and lose something that defines anime (by which they basically mean fanservice). They give the same arguments because, if you disagree with their argument, they see you as a threat to anime.",

What I gathered so far is that the ending of the anime is completely different and more \"happy\" than the manga, and the whole manga is very \"tonally different\" allegedly (manga is more somber while anime focuses on the comedy), but like I said.. idk if its worth spending 120$ for essentially the same story...\n\nBasically, how good of an adaptation was the anime?

It's done really well, too. There were times where Kaiki managed to trick me into thinking that he wasn't being a lying, swindling piece of shit, especially during the whole standoff with Nadeko. Also just every time either Senjougahara or Ononoki are on screen, the show becomes great. All of their lines, delivered with incredible dead-panned voices are brilliant.!<\n\n[cont] >!My favorite bit in the whole arc though is that the one thing everyone agrees on is that under no circumstances must Araragi know about what's happening. They all know he's a big dumb-dumb who would immediately mess everything up and get everyone killed. Hopefully the events of the last two arcs will lead to some character growth for him, because, as of right now, I much, *much* prefer Kaiki as a protagonist.!<\n\nyeeeeyyy... peace!",

It's totally doable, AoT has multiple fights where both sides of the conflict/skirmish have legitimate strategies and ideas that don't feel too absurd like \"I have a trap card for your trap card for my trap card!\"\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think a show focusing on the strategies and tactics and whatnot will be that engrossing. It's the typical problem of focusing on what should be the secondary conflict without setting up a proper primary conflict. Like LoGH works perfectly well with its janky \"this shouldn't work in space\" tactics because the backbone of the primary conflict is so darn strong - a weaker set of characters with stronger tactics wouldn't be nearly as good IMO.",

Medalist, Orb, Blue Box, and Re:Zero will receive at least a few nominations. Solo Leveling s2 will get some nominations but likely no wins, it\u2019s not as popular with the \u201ccore users\u201d who regularly lurk/post here, much of its success is with people that don\u2019t watch a lot of other anime and don\u2019t visit this sub as much, meaning they don\u2019t participate in the awards voting. Apothecary Diaries s2 will do well but so far it doesn\u2019t seem to have the juice entirely because the arc it\u2019s covered so far has been very episodic/set-up for later. Lots of great individual episodes that don\u2019t collectively lead to a swell of enthusiasm. Sequels like Hanako, My Happy Marriage, and 100GF are at risk of single genre nominations and nothing else. \n\nAve Mujica may or may not be up the jury\u2019s alley considering they ultimately left Girls Band Cry out to dry in the winner voting.\n\nNot sure how Zenshu is going to land, but it deserves production nominations at least. \n\nIt\u2019s not a bad season but it lacks star power. \n\nAll in all this seems like it could be a more open year with fewer \u201ctitans\u201d.",
