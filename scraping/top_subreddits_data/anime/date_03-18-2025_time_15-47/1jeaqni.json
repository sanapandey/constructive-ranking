    "selftext": "\n\nRight off the bat, there\u2019s **Zatsu Tabi**, **Mono** and **Food for the Soul**. All look like they\u2019re gonna be good iyashikei akin to the likes of Yuru Camp, Yama no Susume. Probably the ones I\u2019m most looking forward to.\n\nOf course, **Slime 300** is back and while there are elements of fantasy adventure, it\u2019s mostly just chill SOL and I hope S2 carries that forward.\n\n**Shoushimin** is another returning title and while it\u2019s not exactly cheerful, the atmospheric vibes that I got from S1 was immaculate. I could enjoy the first season just from the ambience alone.\n\n**Summer Pockets** seems promising with a rather SOL premise and a gorgeous backdrop of the Seto Inland Sea. Though I\u2019m lowkey cautious cos there\u2019s an air of drama or maybe even something dark about it. It\u2019s giving me Atri vibes.\n\n**Anne Shirley** looks old school and I\u2019m not really sure what it\u2019s about but the PV looks like it has a really refreshing atmosphere.\n\nAs a SOL and iyashikei enjoyer, I\u2019m really looking forward to these shows and Spring 2025 is already looking so chill. Do you guys know any other show that looks like it\u2019s gonna be chill or comfy ?",

(Also former assistant of Gintama if you aren't familiar with that) It's ultimately a gag comedy first, but you will really come to love the cast. Being done by Bibury and having recently watched the prescreening for the first 3 episodes, the adaptation is in good hands.\n\nAnother one I am intrigued by is [Uchuujin MuuMuu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/60401/Uchuujin_MuuMuu). Not familiar with the manga, but the premise gives me the sense it will be good for SoL vibes.",

I guess it's the generational difference between people who were or weren't around when Sket Dance was released. I'm part of the latter and instead more familiar with Astra Lost in Space, which was very good as both manga and anime so I'm looking forward to Witch Watch.",
