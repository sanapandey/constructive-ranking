We have a huge opportunity,\u201d Salke said.\n\nJapan represents one of Prime Video\u2019s most valuable territories, offering a large marketplace business with 72 add-on subscriptions and nearly 300,000 titles available for transactional video on demand (TVOD). Salke said that Prime Video is \u201ccommitted to a growing slate,\u201d especially when it comes to licensing original anime. \u201cOne of the most exciting things we\u2019re doing here in Japan is talking about our plans for ramping up those that content strategy for the next several years,\u201d she added.\n\nThe streaming service has already established itself as a market leader in Japan, with Day noting that the country has \u201cone of the largest install bases for Prime members,\u201d making it \u201cone of our largest markets outside the U.S.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about maintaining a competitive edge in Japan, Salke confirmed that anime is a priority. \u201cWe have a big commitment to an anime slate that we\u2019re pulling together, and the teams are all working on it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of exciting stuff in the works that we\u2019re looking forward to sharing, and that\u2019s an ongoing commitment.\u201d",

                    "body": "I still remember the days of Anime Strike. It was wild how hard at one point they tried to buy their way into the market and failed. Barely anyone wanted to pay for the two subscriptions needed for the service and it was inconvenient to use. You defiantly had to dig in order to find what you wanted.\n\n\nThere was such a big celebration when the service finally shut down. I had never seen a community so happy to see a streaming service go down and joking that the wicked witch was dead!\n\n\nIt's wild because I feel like with how they've been developing their adult animation library they're in a better position now a days to take that market they've built upon and expand it organically into the anime market. I feel like there's a lot of overlap between the western animation and anime communities, so it could work.\n\n\nHowever, I do understand your concerns.\n\n\nI think they're learned some stuff from last time (having everything just be apart of prime as a whole, taking things slower than last time, and not trying to seemingly buy everything up). It also seems like they're interested in tapping into more of the female demographic by how much they talked about them. So, that points towards maybe getting more titles not squarely aimed at the male demographic (which is great \ud83d\udc4d).\n\n\nHowever, they are defiantly gonna fuck it up in other ways by the sounds of it, mainly in investing probably way too much into gen ai. I am not encouraged at all by how they talked about it in the interview nor when they mentioned it being used in pitch meetings. Not to mention the ai dubbing project they started to implement with some of their general dubbing programs. They haven't used it on any of their anime titles yet, but I will be so PISSED if they do that. I will be BEYOUND PISSED if they do this to the new Gundam show! \ud83d\ude24\n\n\nIf they have ai dubbing touch any of their anime titles, both new and old, that will automatically make them the worst anime distributor in my eyes (even being below Hulu/Disney, which is a lot because I've had a lot of frustrations with them as anime streaming sites\u00a0for a while now).\n\n\nOverall, I think this is gonna be a mixed, possibly very frustrating, bag.",

Amazon bought up licenses to shows, simulcast them with missing subs, mistimed subs, or subs from the wrong episode. They couldn't get episodes up on time. They had no direct pipeline in place to produce dubs and, for some shows I think, they had an behind-the-scenes deal to have Sentai Filmworks produce the subs, but the shows outside of that arrangement were a crapshoot.\n\nThis was all on top of the fact that Amazon charged an extra monthly fee for \"Anime Strike\" which required Prime. So you had to pay for prime, *then* you had to pay an additional fee for their absolute bottom barrel trash tier service. Also, like Netflix, they don't really do physical releases, so that pissed off collectors and, last I read, anime fans buy discs at a higher proportional rate than some other mediums.\n\nAnime Strike sucked so hard that Sentai Filmworks ended whatever arrangement they had quickly and spun up their own HiDive streaming service to host new shows, and eventually migrated some formerly Strike-only titles over once Amazon's exclusivity period expired, like Princess Principal. But then *other* shows, such as the ones from Amazon's deal with the Noitamina animation block, fell into the ether after Amazon killed Strike only one year after launching it.\n\nAmazon is the reason why some \"big deal\" series like Grand Blue Dreaming and Wotakoi had zero chance of getting a dub and don't have BD releases in the US and probably other markets, and in some cases you can't even legally stream them any more.\n\nObviously the OP article here is about anime content *in Japan* so this isn't exactly the same situation, but I fully believe that if Amazon is going to start locking down shows at the source then they're going to go for more global rights, too.",

They potentially produced the subtitles that Amazon used, and they simulcast the episodes in certain markets such as Canada while Strike had exclusivity in the US. Seasonals from 2017 like Princess Principal and others, I want to say maybe Girls Last Tour, fell into this bucket. Sentai likely already had the BD release license and was just sharing or deferring the US simulcast license over to Amazon.\n\nSentai *had* a streaming platform, The Anime Network, but that was floundering and shut down around the same time Amazon fired up Anime Strike. Then when Strike fumbled the bag as hard as it did, HiDive popped up with Sentai shows in other markets (again, Canada as an example) while their lineup in the US was positively anemic until Strike's exclusivity began falling off. These \"Sentai owns some part of this license\" shows all did get an eventual physical release.\n\nThere were a few other shows where, as far as I could research at the time, there was no Sentai involvement *at first* but they did pick up the license for a physical some time afterward. I want to say maybe Killing Bites is an example of this, but it wasn't very many shows.\n\nAnd a lot of Noitamina's stuff never got a physical release. Amazon had apparently signed a multi-year agreement with that programming block because even *after* Amazon basically gave up on new licenses and killed Strike off, there was like an additional year or so where Amazon still ended up with a few new shows which they just shoved into basic Prime membership, and then they essentially stopped exclusively licensing titles at all once that contract expired. As far as I know, basically none of those shows were ever rescued by anyone else.",

            "body": "I know from observations that Prime video JP related stuff has a lot of obscure shows see re-release. A couple of examples:\n\n- [Zukkoke Knight: Don De La Mancha](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B0CN5R6X8T) (well missing 3 aired eps and what they have suffers from a lot of tape damage)\n- [Azusa, Otetsudaishimasu!](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E4%BA%80%E5%9E%A3%E4%B8%80/dp/B0B8M8TQK1/) (this was a TV special that has **never** had a home release, until now you've had to use a 2004 hardsubbed fansub with an animax watermark in the bottom-right, so thanks to dAnime Store, Prime Video & the fan who OCRd the fansub there's now a softsubbed version)\n- [Honoo no Toukyuuji: Dodge Danpei](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B09M7X53QJ/) (maybe not quite as it a got [an SDBD in 2023](https://www.fwinc.co.jp/news/82811/), a sequel manga has been going for a couple of years and the anime had dubs in Taiwanese, Korean, Spanish, Italian and Polish plus it was said to kickstart a dodgeball craze in Japan in the early 90s)\n\nThose are all add-on channels however so somewhat secondary to the articles point (I know they're mentioned in the blurb \"we've got lots of content...other peoples content as an add-on, which we also get a service cut\"). While I find the concept of add-on channels to be a bit of a sham/not learning why people cut fucking cords in the first place (plus Amazon gets the credit for essentially webhosting...which given how many major streaming services use AWS servers anyway seems damned if you do or don't) I have to wonder if the Japanese ones are better managed.\n\nThe ones in the west can be poorly managed. The Crunchyroll Amazon Prime channel has all sorts of problems like missing shows, missing episodes within shows (or an episode exists might only be subbed in Spanish) or wrong subtitles (not just speech to text model auto generated dub subtitles based off the English dub^* replacing the Japanese audio subs but subs for completely different shows end of) and attempts to get support are both parties pointing the finger at the other.\n\n^* - These being used for English dubs is a tragedy (Crunchyroll do it too; [here's some Kemono Michi: Rise Up examples](https://old.reddit.com/r/Crunchyroll/comments/1i7po4z/ai_cc_subtitles_are_absolute_trash_even_after_ceo/m8o4zoi/) or how about [Shangri-la Frontier](https://old.reddit.com/r/Crunchyroll/comments/1i7po4z/ai_cc_subtitles_are_absolute_trash_even_after_ceo/m8xeeza/)). Apparently BritBox is full of something like [unintelligible accent] as their model can not understand certain British dialects. If subtitles are necessary the shows usually have teletext subs from when they aired and on previous home releases which could be used. However, I wonder if they don't comply with subtitle style guides and yes, they can be dated (i.e. worse than Netflix subs when it comes to truncating dialogue) but the subtitler has had to actually think and can process the shows visuals, a speech to text can't rely on visuals but might be able to to prompted with context...which requires a human anyway.\n\n---\n\nAnyway reading the variety article:\n\n> \u201cWe have noticed that with big film releases like \u2018Red One\u2019 and \u2018Air\u2019 and others that the theatrical release just enhanced the the impact of those titles on Prime Video, making some of them the biggest titles that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Salke said.\n\nRed One is still a box office ~~flop~~ bomb ($200+mm budget, $185mm WW revenue and that was mostly WB; Streaming <month after BO release) and streaming numbers were apparently salted by being an autoplay after a sporting event. There are questions about how sustainable the massive production costs of some Amazon Prime direct to streaming content really are (plus the sheer volume of content, some years back I accidentally signed up the an Amazon Prime trial and was going to watch some of their exclusives but being greeted with multiple seasons of 8-10 episodes that were an hour apiece was off-putting so I just watched some films and anime instead). I guess to shift back to anime given how cheaply anime productions are done would be nice to see some of that money flow that way for better conditions or whatnot...not gonna happen of course because why build better when you can build more.",

So many of the same old plot over and over. It's terrible. Or the same \"romantic\" romcom till you want to puke. The only redeeming grace are the animes and even some of those are copycats.",

They should focus, aim their resources on the shows that will benefit all the parts involved, no one has to lose its job (to my personal taste, cutting trashy isekais, fantasy, villainess or expelled from heroes party should be the start). And yeah a major surgery has to be made, but it's up to the japanese companies to start, for which I stand on what I said, they could start by reducing the amount of titles every season.",
