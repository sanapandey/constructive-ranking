Actually, I heard once that the nickname could be players in-game making a reference to Berserk in-universe, which is pretty funny.\n\nWhy is Kirito called The Black Swordsman in subs? I dunno. Probably cause it was briefer then 'The Swordsman in Black' and more easily digestible if I had to guess.",

To me \u9ed2\u306e\u5263\u58eb could easily be translated as \"black swordsman\" and be completely correct. \u9ed2 is a noun and with \u306e simply connects it to \u5263\u58eb, making it act more like an adjective. While \u9ed2\u3044 is simply an \u3044-adjective. Feels like the distinction only exists in Japanese but not when translated.\n\nYou're definitely right though that natively they are literally different.",

Meanwhile you mostly hear Kuro to mention the actual color black. Kirito has black hair, eyes, swird, and clothes so it makes since to identify him by the color where as Guts would be refered to that for both darkness of look and personality.\u00a0 Thats how I would interpreet it as someone who doesnt know real japanese but has seen a ton of anime.",

The \"no\" in Kuro no Kenshi would basically be the word \"The\" in English so my take is that Guts is Dark Swordsman and Kirito is The Black Swordsman in literal translation. Subs/dubs will purposefully choose words that sound better in english as opposed to literal translation and thats why they ended up the same.
