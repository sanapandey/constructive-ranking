A better writer might have had his second or third skill cancel out one of the earlier skills and maybe saddle him with a really bad drawback, and then he gets scared to take any more skill fruits unless it's a life or death situation where it makes sense to gamble. I think that's more or less what they had in mind, but they never explained it adequately and it just didn't end up making sense from a world building perspective.",
