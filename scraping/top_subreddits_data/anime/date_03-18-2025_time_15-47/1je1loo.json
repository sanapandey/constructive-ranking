Not to mention it\u2019s just the characters doing the same dance for 20 seconds during the chorus. The second op is probably the worse of the two. Season 2\u2019s ops are better both pacing wise and have more striking visuals (the swapping between past and present in op4 for example to contrast their development vs season 1 where it just shows the students and their scores) the technical value or the ops animation is consistent but the way they use their animation later on has a much more ambitious idea behind it besides \u201chere are our characters!\u201d",
