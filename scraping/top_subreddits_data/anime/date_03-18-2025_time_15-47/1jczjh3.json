Today we are discussing..\n\n[Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin \u2022 Alderamin on the Sky](https://preview.redd.it/smsgw94yt4pe1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=635804d3db92ba5e465df644d331ba7e01338c91)\n\nIkta Solork is a carefree young man who only wants two things in life: a woman on his arm and a place to nap. Unfortunately, his peaceful life is destroyed when war breaks out between the Katjvarna Empire and the neighboring Republic of Kioka. Ikta and his childhood friend, Yatorishino Igsem, join the army as military officers, where they meet the infantryman Matthew Tetojirichi, the sniper Torway Remion, and the medic Haroma Becker on a boat heading for the military exam site.  \n  \nHowever, after a rogue storm sinks their vessel, the five of them end up in enemy territory near a military outpost. There, they discover that the heir to the Katjvarnan throne, Princess Chamille Kitora Katjvanmaninik, has been taken hostage. The five are able to rescue her, and as a reward, each one of them is granted the title of Imperial Knight\u2014one of the highest honors a soldier can receive. It seems that Ikta will have to put his dream of tranquility on hold, as he must now become the hero he never wanted to be.\n\n(Source: MAnimeList)\n\nDatabases \n\n[AniDB](https://anidb.net/anime/11679) | | [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31764) | | [Anilist](https://anilist.co/anime/21410)\n\n# Streams\n\n[https://www.livechart.me/anime/1860/streams](https://www.livechart.me/anime/1860/streams)\n\nRemember that any information not found early in the show itself is considered a spoiler.

I enjoyed it a lot, especially thanks to the MC and female lead, but it just kinda *ends* when there's clearly still so much more story left to go. \n\n~~Also if I can stop getting its OP mixed up with Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens' OP in AMQ already, that would be great.~~",

The light novels are, by light novel standards, pretty compact. As such, even though the anime adapted three light novels, it did a pretty good job at doing so. That said, this is one of the better written light novels out there, and it is worth reading from the beginning for that alone.\n\nAdapted 3 of 14 LNs.\n\nI remember it was translated on that wiki translation site I'm not allowed to name a decade ago, but at the time there were so few chapters I left it and forgot about it.\n\nThen when I came across the anime I keep getting it confused with Remembrances for a Certain Pilot (The Princess and the Pilot) and so never watched it..",

But this was still a show about a lazy character who is inexplicably a strategic genius without any sort of effort required. There were a high number of asspulls in this show rather than any insightful tactics.\n\nI always try shows that feature battle tactics and strategy, but it's usually a letdown every time. You know the genre is lacking when freakin' Goblin Slayer is one of the better shows out there that focuses on battle tactics.",
