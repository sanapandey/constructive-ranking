I love them so much, [they're so fun together](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/yvdcwb5pg9y.png)!\n\nAnd just as I thought, [Yomiko will help Uryuu and Shirahi return in the next episode](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/739cxn2kzd7.png), which will unfortunately be the last one :( I'm still looking forward to it though!\n\nHere my screenshot albums from the episode:\n\n* [Shirahi](https://imgchest.com/p/qe4georab7j)\n* [Shirahi & Uryuu (Group scenes)](https://imgchest.com/p/9249vojoa7n)\n* [Amagami Sisters (Group & Single scenes)](https://imgchest.com/p/bp453adwg75)\n* [Group scenes](https://imgchest.com/p/agyv2memz48)\n* [Uryuu](https://imgchest.com/p/ne7b58x8v75)\n* [Others](https://imgchest.com/p/vj4j9rqv5y8)\n\n*EDIT.

I am sure most of us have been a losing hero or heroine at some point in our lives. Furthermore for Shirahi, Uryu is the person closest to her, so I can understand why she does not want to lose him to anyone else. Desperate people may sometimes make desperate wishes.\n\nNonetheless, I am relieved to see Shirahi received only a (potential) losing end, not a bad end. To a certain extent, it means the bonds she has forged with Uryu over the years is relatively strong.  \n  \nYay, my wish got granted! Yomiko appeared once more and her mischievous expression probably means she knows and may have a solution to return Uryu and Shirahi to their original world. As expected of an experienced senior priestess!",

You can't say the girl didn't give her all into seducing him. It's no wonder Uryu didn't completely hate this timeline lol. \n\nIt's kind of cute how she totally had their dream married couple life all figured out. Too bad it's just not meant to be.  \n\nImagine if the girls had stayed behind long enough for Shirahi to bring up having their \"first time\" after exams lol. \n\nShirahi is the classic childhood friend and as such she lost the way a lot of childhood friends did because they can never be honest with their feelings despite wanting their childhood friend to return them and then it becomes too late when he meets a new girl(s) who steals her chance from her. And the worst part is she realized it and accepted her mistakes, and changing the world with her wish didn't make up for it and only made her feel worse because of the lie of a relationship it was built around. \n\nShe wears the shrine maiden uniform well. Actually, the fact that they mentioned having a part-timer makes me wonder if that might become a plot point later. \n\nUryu didn't even formally reject Shirahi but taking her with him as she got in romcom moments with all three sisters and was utterly mesmerized accomplished that without him even needing to say anything. I feel bad for Shirahi again. \n\nCould we see a team-up of the two Amagami Mama's to set this world back on the correct path?",

Just in time for Shirahi to appear wearing nothing but a shirt that looks like it's about to fall off! Though she's not here to seduce Uryu but to instead study with him! They've got to get into Kyoto U so they can live out their dream as a husband-and-wife doctor team and run Kisaki-En together! With maybe sex coming after they finish their exams! Or not, Shirahi sure does love teasing Uryu.\n\nUryu finally figures out the truth and confronts Shirahi about it and Shirahi finally comes clean. Despite everything, the guilt had been eating away at her and she didn't want to keep this bottled up from Uryu any longer. That she'd been the childhood friend who could never be honest about her feelings and could only tease Uryu, never being able to face him until it was too late...when the Amagami Sisters had moved into the place she thought she had by his side. She knows she should've been honest, should have told him how she felt about him, and now she's messed everything up.\n\nBut Uryu, being Uryu, is just happy that Shirahi is finally honest with him and wishes he could have understood her feelings...which honestly makes Shirahi feel worse when she's the only one that should feel bad, but that's just the kind of guy Uryu is.\n\nIt's nice of Uryu to show Shirahi that he's still the same old Uryu. He understands now that people pray to the Gods out of their genuine feelings, silly or otherwise, and he wants to nurture those feelings as part of his desire to help others.\n\nSure Shirahi completely rewrote the world and altered history, but it's not the worst version of the world and the Amagami Sisters can understand where she was coming from...so no sense in any recriminations or blame.\n\nTime for one last Amagami Festival in this world! Complete with shrine maiden Shirahi! With Uryu getting in a moment with each Amagami Sister to show Shirahi how close he is to them and how right he feels when he's by their side, and seeing how dazzled he is by their powerpoint shrine dance, she knows that he's obviously in love with all three of them. Which hurts, but she can't deny what is before her eyes, especially with her own feelings for Uryu.\n\nYomiko arrives! And I'm guessing she does remember Uryu and is just hiding it.",

            "body": "I really appreciate how uryu reacted when shirahi confessed that she was responsible for ~~changing the worldline.~~  He reacted with kindness and empathy, even going far as apologizing for his ignorance for shirahi's feelings. \n\nI personally would have been freaked out if I were uryu. Yeah i know she's my childhood friend and all, but sheesh man.. going desperate and turning to world bending wishes just to win me over? Kinda creepy\n\nBut I guess I'm not as kind and understanding as uryu lol. \n\nI actually really liked how much joy uryu felt when he went back to his room. Gives an idea on how much love he has developed for the shrine. \n\nAll in all, the confrontation with shirahi went better as I expected. She could've gone freako yandere psycho mode and deny that she made that wish. But I guess deep inside, shirahi knew that this wasn't the way. After the festival, she knew that the only way forward was to accept defeat, and continue supporting uryu's journey to his dream. \n\nAs for how they're gonna go back to the old world, I guess yomiko san would help out. Maybe exorcising or fixing up the kuragami shrine?\n\nWith the last ep coming up, I'm guessing they're gonna end this season (and yes I'm REALLY hoping this gets a 2nd season) with somehow confirming that uryu is indeed interested with one (or maybe all them heck idk) of the sisters.",

The fact that he does this makes Shirahi feel even guiltier and finally is honest with him.\n\n But it is sweet to know now she understands why he is so fond of the 3 sisters. After all, they were super nice to her, and you could see they could have been close friends.",

How many times does she wants Uryu to imagine them doing it lol. If they're really going out, Uryu blood level will always rise for sure. Eavesdropping 'sanshimai' really cute especially Yuna. 'Sanshimai' dissing Uryu will never get old for me.\n\nI really really don't want this to end TT. Please announce next season!!",
