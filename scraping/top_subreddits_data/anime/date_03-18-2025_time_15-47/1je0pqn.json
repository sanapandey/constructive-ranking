I always use Crunchyroll and almost never leave ratings on shows (though I\u2019m a huge fan of both One Piece and Solo Leveling) \u2014 it\u2019s definitely a cool accolade, but it being the most popular anime based just off \u201cnumber of ratings\u201d is probably stretching it.\n\nEither way it\u2019s hugely successful \u2014 passing One Piece in anything is really impressive.",
