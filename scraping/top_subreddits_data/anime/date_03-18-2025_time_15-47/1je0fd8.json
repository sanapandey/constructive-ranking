Modern techniques were developed with modern character designs in mind and vice versa, but trying to force old and new together ain't working.\n\nIf they wanted to keep the character designs, they should have gone to the trouble of mimicking old color; Megalobox did that fantastically over half a decade ago. But that's probably outside of budget.\n\nEdit: the Chief Animation Director/Character Designer previously did character design for... Tribe Nine, The Legendary Hero is Dead, and the more recent Duel Masters (after 2014)... \n\nThat might be the least impressive resume I've ever seen.\n\nAnd the director did High School DxD Hero... \n\n^(and) *^(Nee Summer!)*\n\n**Okay, really, is somebody fucking with me?

Certain face angles don't look right -- like how the woman on the right's face looks like it's a low-poly PS1 model in the first image, because her features are so sharp that it makes the shading sharp as well.\n2. It's going to be much harder to stay on model thanks to the difficult shading\n3. The overly-detailed hair is going to be a massive headache.\n\nYou can see the latter two crop up in the teaser trailer.",
