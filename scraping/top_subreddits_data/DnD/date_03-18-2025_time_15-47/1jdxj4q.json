    "selftext": "One of my friends decided to play with another group because our group couldn\u2019t find a consistent schedule. He then told me how that game progresses:\n\nThey are a group of criminals in prison. (this is their checkpoint to stop most likely) It is agreed that they\u2019d break out of prison and meet up at a specific location. When the time comes, there was one that couldn\u2019t make it. (The guy was late to the session) so the group assumed that he (the character) is dead and moved on, onto the ship they go.\n\nLater, when the guy joined, they wouldn\u2019t let him play. They said his character IS dead. IS. As if it\u2019s a fact and not a guess. There is nothing to confirm his death but just because he didn\u2019t show up. Maybe he was just didn\u2019t manage to broke out, and is still in prison. Maybe he couldn\u2019t find the location on time. There are plenty of ways to let the guy back in, to let him PLAY. Just let his character reappear somewhere in the story. Their destination is some island, he told me. Then his character could reappear on that island for whatever reasons: this island was his hometown so it is where he went to right after getting out of prison; they\u2019ve talked about the island before so he knew where to look for them; he got transported to a different prison and escape to this island by chance. There are plenty of ways to let the guy back into the game, but they wouldn\u2019t do so, because they say they like realism. So for the sake of a \u2018realism\u2019 in a fantasy roleplay game that you throw away one of your friends out of the game? Get some senses into you!\n\nI\u2019ve only played one session of dnd in my life, but I do so as a DM. (Then the group got busy and never group up again). I enjoyed having my company with them, so seeing him and his group to cast aside one of their friends just because he\u2019s late is simply spoiled. They don\u2019t know how lucky they\u2019re to have a group with aligned free time.\n",

Like you've said, the player usually does some background stuff before re-joining in some manner. \n\nOtherwise this is seen as punishment in most cases. Sometimes people are just late for whatever reasons and if they know they're going to be punished in a similar fashion they would likely not stay in the campaign for long. \n\nNot a fan of this DM style. I'm sure they have their own reasons for doing so. Would not join.",

If it is a vital story beat they must be present for such as the final boss for an arc or something relating to their character specifically, the session is cancelled and we resume next time. The players that did show just hang out and play games or watch movies.\n2.) The game continues on as if they aren't missing and their character is just there when they return next session. Usually followed by jokes about how the character was clipping into the ground or glitching, etc.\n\nOut-of-game actions deserve out-of-game punishments. If this is a first time offense, absolutely unacceptable DMing imo. If this is in response to a repeat offense where the stakes were clearly laid out \"Hey you've been missing a lot of sessions recently. If it happens again, you're out of the campaign.\" then it's fine but you need to communicate to the player that that is what's happening. Nobody should ever show up to the table and be surprised that their character is dead.",

And if for some reason, they kept having issues showing up on-time even after agreeing to this, I would hope they would back out of the campaign first before I decide on kicking them because their tardiness or lack of attendance negatively impacts the party. I would definitely give them a warning before kicking but that would be the sole action I take. \n\nNo punishments because not everyone responds well to them. \n\nGiving a person a clear concise request. If they fail the request then we are unfortunately no longer on the same page. Simple enough. No malice behind it. Just a scheduling conflict that was resolved with them no longer being in the group.\n\n>And actually instituting that rule for such a player, and enforcing it should they continue their behavior, is entirely reasonable. \n\nSo you punished them. How do you think they feel? What are the chances of this person changing their ways? What happens when they do it again? Another punishment? Additional punishment? \n\nPunishments are very useful for certain applications. However, I don't believe it's useful in this manner. Punishments in DnD won't motivate most players into changing. It usually makes things worse. Resentment. Anger. Feeling slighted. Feeling singled out despite us all knowing this person is at fault. It however, still doesn't make them feel any better and it likely won't in the future of said campaign. They're pretty much on borrowed time after that or however much longer they may stay for the campaign. And if that's usually the case for punishments, why have them in this specific application? \n\nPunishments are only useful if they want to be somewhere. For example, if you're living in a country, you have to abide by their laws if you wanna stay in said country. But players don't need to stay in a campaign, especially if they \"feel\" like they're not being treated fairly. I say fairly but everyone's got their own ideas of what constitutes as fair these days.",

It\u2019s not really relevant in that moment how they feel about it: they fucked up, that consequence is of their own making.

My player threw in a joke pretending to gaslight the characters that they were always there the whole time.\n\nSo I made that canon. They got one of the first vestiges, and it was originally designed for a halfling character. They decided it would be funny if they kept being mistaken for a halfling as a tiny human (4'9\").\n\nSo now, the vestige has the side effect of making them invisible and casting silence on them that they can't control. Perfect for a rogue with a gift from a trickster deity. Now, they can't really interact, unless I need them to use their vestige (it has revivify) or they are present.",
