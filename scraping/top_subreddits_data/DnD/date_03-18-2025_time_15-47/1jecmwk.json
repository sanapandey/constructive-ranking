She\u2019s naive and clumsy so I wanted to draw her tripping cause I wanted more practice doing unique poses and I thought it would be cute. I loved the colors that were chosen for her, the pink was very fun to draw with the blue. I took some inspiration from bg3 and tried making her a lil more demonic looking but I still wanted her to be cute",
