    "selftext": "This happened in the first 10 minutes of my first time DMing\u2014ever. One of the players declared he was grappling a barmaid, and it was clear from his tone what kind of scene he was trying to create.\n\nIn the moment, I shrugged it off as stupid and immature. I had the barmaid smash a jug of beer over his head, knocking him prone so she could escape. We moved on. But after the session, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of discomfort. And I\u2019m a guy\u2014I could only imagine how the women at the table felt.\n\nI messaged the player afterward, telling him never to try anything like that again in my games. He brushed it off as a joke but said he wouldn\u2019t do it again. I thought that was the end of it. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe next session, I noticed the women barely looked at him. Their responses to him\u2014both in and out of character\u2014were cold and distant. The group quietly fell apart after session two.\n\nThat was 10 years ago. Looking back, I realize I could have handled it better. I could have said, *No, you don\u2019t.* I could have had his character arrested. I could have made it clear that this wasn\u2019t acceptable at my table. But more than anything, I should have had a **Session 0**\u2014a conversation before the game even started where I laid out that this kind of behavior wouldn\u2019t be tolerated.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re a DM or a player, especially a new one: **Have a Session 0. Set boundaries with eachother. Make it clear what\u2019s off-limits and what is not.** You never know when one bad moment might poison the whole experience for your players.",

Such moves aren't ok by default, unless it was explicitly mentioned they are (for whatever reason... I cannot really think of any that isn't creepy though)",

One player suddenly realized she had agreed to it prematurely.

I like playing lawful evil, and my standard character setup is a lawful evil paladin of the crown.\nThat paladin of the crown works with good hero's. It's his duty to protect people, his motivations are mostly selfish or tied to his oaths. He is honorable in that he always upholds his oaths & bargains, but he would burn a village to the ground and slaughter its people if the king gave the order. He wants to advance in society and places his duty to the nation above his own wellbeing, so if he encounters a rampant thief or murderer he will give them no quarter, be they PC or NPC. Likewise he won't allow a liability to stay in the party, he won't murder a PC who ruins plans, but he will demand they stop or leave, and if they say start a fight while everyone is sneaking, he will arrest then for endangering the party. Exact terms of the charges vary based on the other characters exact actions,  group composition, and specific scenario. But resisting arrest and using a deadly weapon against a vassal of the king is certainly grounds for lethal reprisal in nearly every medieval society. So the other players character is leaving the part, whether or not he is killed or taken in custody doesn't change that result.",

Nobody is questioning the cleric who is healing the downed character. Nobody is questioning the bard who is trying to seduce the dragon. (Ok bad example) But a character who is in some way fucking over the party, or who is violating the social contract, someone at the table is going to say, \"dude wtf are you doing. That's not cool.\" Then, only then, do players bust out \"it's what my character would do.\"",

They *know* that if they said what the *real* reason is, that only makes it worse. So they don't say, \"I do X because of Y,\" they say, \"it's what my character would do.\" They don't say \"I'm antagonizing the only people who might be willing to help us because it's making you upset,\" they don't say, \"I steal absolutely fucking everything from everyone without regards for the consequences because it makes the DM's job harder,\" or \"I grope the tavern wench because it's makes the women players uncomfortable,\" they say, \"it's what my character would do.\"\n\nIf you are going to justify it with a rational reason with some semblance of sense, you can just do that.

It can express itself in many ways, from a barbarian always starting fights during negotiations to a rogue hiding treasure (or worse, directly stealing items from) the party.\n\nWe actually had a character (not player) leave our party recently as they were starting to make increasingly unilateral actions to the point where they were both starting to screw over the group AND steal spotlight during other characters important story moments. This culminated in the character deciding to attack the embassy of a enemy nation while we were acting as diplomats of our own. while we were visiting the city to try so that our wizard could mend the rift between his two sisters and their respective factions.\n\nWhen asked, he tried saying that \"its what his character to do\". Even outside the spotlight stealing and potentially ruining the culmination of our wizards plot arc, several of us noted that we wouldn't want to work with someone who would screw us over like that.\n\nI only really had the one question for him: \"knowing this can't continue, and knowing that you are ultimately in charge of what your character does - can you think of a way to pivot your character's mental state to something that won't keep causing issues?\" When he said no, I understood - sometimes you lock yourself in to a roleplay dead-end.\n\nStill, I had my answer. In character, we kicked him from the group. The DM has taken over that character and he's likely to turn up as a villain at some point. The player's new character is nowhere near as disruptive to the party.\n\nI only have a few rules for PCs - that they fit the setting, that they are willing to join player group to achieve their character goals, and that said group is willing to hang around with them (ie: their positive traits outweigh their negative traits).\n\nIf something I do might negatively impact the group (or a player), I call it out in advance and get their approval. If it's funny, or dramatically appropriate, I'll often get encouraged to do it.\n\nIf it's not, I find a way to RP my character that doesn't do the disruptive thing - instead of my charging, my barbarian stands behind the party diplomat as a visible threat: \"accept his offer - or make my day.\"\n\n=-=-=\n\nHaving said that the one thing I agree with you about is that the penalty to random stats is a bad way to handle it (sorry, OP). Encourage desired behaviour with the occasional bonus like inspiration. Using mechanics to penalise doesn't resolve anything, take it out of game, and talk it out.",

I know how to meta game. My character has not and does not know these things. They would not know that a creature is immune to fire unless they read a book and find out, so I will still cast fireball \"because its what my character would do\".\n\nAnd my character has a personality that we agreed. If they are a brave idiot, then they will charge in to fight \"because its what my character would do\". If they are a cowardly wizard then they will disengage and hide and only cast spells to save their ass.\n\nIf you as a dm agreed to me creating an evil character, then you should expect me to act evil. But if we didnt create evil characters then expect me to act in line with the characters alignment.\n\nI think what you mean is people saying \"because its what my character would do\" when it is not what their character would do. Justifying evil acts when roleplaying as a good character is the opposite of what their character would do. So, the rule should be for lying or not roleplaying in character.",

I tend to play lawful evil or lawful good characters.

More or less selfish behavior. My favorite type of character is a lawful evil paladin of the crown, they work with the party because it's their duty to uphold the kings law, and protect the nation. He's evil because he is generally apathetic to others, and he would if ordered by a superior, burn down a foreign village & slaughter it's people with few if any qualms.\nHe isn't gonna let a thief, or murderer go unpunished.\nHe also won't let a fool continuously endanger the party by failing to work with the group, he will start by demanding their cooperation, and if that fails he will demand they leave, and if they do something so stupid as to endanger the party again he will arrest them for endangering the party.

And once he's tossed  you out into the cold muddy street (it's not just mud - so you now also have sepsis along with severe internal bleeding), the sherrif wanders by and, as he's taking a leak on you, explains that there Inn is the hub if this community, and the family which runs it are very popular with the locals, which is why the sheriff rarely has much to do, because communities often self police out of mutual interest.\n\nI don't mind evil players, but the more interesting evil players behave rationally and with subtlety - they do good deeds to be seen as good. They pick their moments of evil with restraint, caution and care, because they know that they are playing against the mutual interests of everyone else, including other evil players, and that the consequences of being caught are major.  Stupid Evil aligned players either get dismembered by NPCs or the other players get bored of their antics and see an opportunity in an open tower window.",

I would think that someone could speak up at that point and say, \"Time out,\" but there have been plenty of examples given on this sub of people who freeze and can't.\n\nMoreover, my understanding from what little I've learned of trauma-responsive education is that freezing and being unable to say anything in a situation that invokes memories of trauma often is an involuntary response, just like people who are in the middle of those situations in real life find themselves unable to respond. I've heard it explained as being not just fight or flight, but fight, flee, or freeze\u2014in effect, play dead and try to shut down your own feeling to protect yourself.\n\nGiven this, and given that more people have been sexually assaulted than we probably realize, I think it is wisest for sexual assault or rape-and-revenge stories to be off the table. **Content warning\u2014SA.** If you want an anecdote, >!I'm a man who was raped as a teenager, and while I thought I could handle stores related to SA, I was in a game where a player related a backstory that mirrored the same sort of controlling interaction with an older man that preceded my own rape.

When you read a book or watch a movie, you're engaging passively with it. The writer/director has made whatever choices they've made content-wise and the consumer can either choose to keep going or say \"this book sucks\" and put it down.\n\nAs I'm sure you're well aware, DnD is an ongoing act of collaboration between a group of people who theoretically enjoy one another's presence. It's a *game* and the point of a game is that *everyone has fun*. Part of creating a situation where everyone has fun is maintaining a space where everyone feels comfortable participating. \n\nSexual violence isn't just a trope in fiction, it's a real thing that happens to real people. Roughly half of women and a third of men say they've experienced it in some form or another, and the numbers are probably much worse than that but victims are often afraid to discuss it. \n\nYou don't know what may have happened to someone in your group. They just showed up to roll some dice, cast a few spells and hang out with their buddies and all of a sudden they're re-living the worst thing that's ever happened to them, all because someone at the table wanted to be an edge lord. \n\nYou said that when fantasy crosses the line into reality, that's where there's a problem. And I agree. If one player has their character take an action in fiction that causes another player anxiety/discomfort/panic due to things that have happened to them in the real world, that (to me) is crossing that line.\n\nAnd the violence thing is a false equivalency. Combat is a core mechanic of the game; anyone who is staunchly opposed to violence to the point of having a severely negative reaction to its depiction....just wouldn't play DnD. The fact that a person is playing the game is implicit consent regarding depictions of violence, and making an attack roll is explicit consent to participating in it. A reasonable, prudent person would have an expectation of encountering violence in a DnD game in a way that indicates to the other members of the table that it's subject matter that they are comfortable with. \n\nSexual violence is *literally* not a part of the game from a mechanics standpoint. Nowhere in the Players Handbook does it say that a higher STR or CON helps you resist rape. Why? Because sexual assault is not mechanically part of the game. And if it's not mechanical, it's just flavor that you can choose to use or not use. So....why choose something that might make one of your fellow players feel awful?\n\nA game is a living entity that's also a social contract. And the thing about social contracts is that sometimes you can't do every single thing that you may want. Telling someone that they can't yell \"Fire\" in a crowded theater isn't censorship, it's the simple math that one person's freedom to be an asshole doesn't supercede everyone else in the theater's right to not suffer as the results of that assholery. \n\nIt's just being a little kind, a little considerate and not wanting to cause suffering during what is, again, something that's supposed to be fun for all involved. \n\nHave you ever sat down at the end of a campaign and said \"well, it was *okay*, I guess. It really sucks that we didn't do more sex crimes though.\" I certainly hope not. I do however have friends who have had to leave campaigns because someone was being an edgelord and did something in game that brought up some past trauma they had as SA survivors, to the point where they no longer felt comfortable remaining in that group.\n\nIn a world of infinite fantasy and creativity, it shouldn't be hard to avoid that one thing, unless everyone at the table explicitly states that they're fine with it. That's all.",

For two reasons:\n\n1) This is a massive bit of hypocrisy, to be absolutely fine with killing but not with sex.  It's a serious flaw in modern American (almost exclusively) culture; we're absolutely OK with graphic death, but show a nipple and everyone loses their minds.  This is... backwards.\n\n2) And even ignoring that, heroic fantasy *requires* evil things to exist.  A hero is someone who fights evil and resists it; without evil, heroes don't exist.  So the fantasy *requires* criminals and killers and thieves and rapists and slavers and necromancers, and all other forms of evil.  Evil is Evil, no matter the form it takes, and that's what Heroes fight against.\n\nYou can't have adventures in a world without problems.  What's important is that you *discuss* with *your particular group* what kinds of problems are acceptable and which are not.  Rape is no more nor less evil than murder, it's no less or more evil than slavery.   So by your logic, anyone who includes *any* of these things is equally horrible.  And we both know that's not what you're trying to say.\n\nIf you have problems with an aspect of the game as DM, it is your right and privilege to exclude it from your tables.  If your players have a problem with an aspect of the game, it is your duty to respect their limits, their lines and veils.  But if everyone is OK with something, then that's no one's business except your table.",

People don't generally make that part of their Discord tag. \n\nI'm not disputing your central thesis.

When the party went to deal with the machine, the kids were initially fighting against the party (since it could help their friend), but one of the party members used his turn to make a compelling speech about how he could save their friend and that he just needed to get rid of the warmachine thing first. \n\nUnfortunately, he didn't tell them to run away, the and the clear implication suggested that they should turn and help him fight the thing to help their friend.... which they did.

There's no fault in doing your best.\n\n(2) For someone who needs that sort of instruction, they're a cancer to any decent group to begin with, and a session zero won't change that.  Session Zero is a great thing, but it's not going to cure a creep, it'll just put them on notice that they have to be sly.\n\nand\n\n(3) Overall, even now, with years to reflect on it, OP still (in my very respectful opinion) is making the mental mistake of trying to resolve a very *out-of-character* problem via in-game channels and methods...which is a mistake.  Trying to lay out every possible way someone might violate the social contract in a session zero is going to be needlessly long, tedious, off-putting, and ineffective...since anyone looking to make the experience about that sort of thing is going to intentionally try to manipulate you on technicalities.  Don't even entertain that battle.\n\nNobody owes anything to anybody at a gaming table.  In this situation (and as I see it...while *absolutely* leaving plenty of room for other, different, also appropriate possibilities), I feel that an appropriate response would be an immediate halt to the game, making it clear that we're no longer speaking within the confines of the social construct of the game, and are now having a conversation as a group of people, and to clearly identify the behavior, to point out that it is completely unacceptable, that *no behavior* of that type will be tolerated, and that the point is completely non-negotiable, and that this would be the only warning.\n\nAny attempt to normalize, rationalize, or marginalize the significance of it would be \"do not pass go, do not collect $200\", and would be a \"please gather your things and leave\".\n\nI may not ask for or demand an *apology* (but it would be nice), however, I would also make it clear, to all present, all at once, that that isn't what I'm about as a DM/GM, and going forward, if anyone is made uncomfortable by anything happening at the table, whether that be in or out of character behaviors...you bring it up, in public or private, and we address it asap, in a way just like this.\n\nI'd be making it clear that this isn't something that will be negotiated based on \"well this is what my character would do\" or \"well my character wasn't *really* going to\".  It's a hard no, never...and the only responses are to accept that or leave.  \n\nIf it was a, \"I'm sorry.  I thought it'd be okay, but I get you, and it won't happen again...I just didn't know.\"  Well okay.  Now you know, and it won't happen again.  That was the whole table's one and only strike...and now whoever did it is on notice that even *hinting* toward it will be their last action at any game I'm running.",

                    "body": "Honestly, I don't even necessarily mind a player playing a character with some terrible character traits. In the right circumstances, it can add depth and facilitate great role-playing. HOWEVER, in my experience, there are a few extremely important caveats to that. The first is that, as you said, someone wanting to play a character that exhibits problematic behavior would have to be brought up beforehand and everyone at the table would have to be ok with it. Secondly, if such a character were to be included, then said behavior would have to be properly fleshed out as part of that character's identity and backstory. For example, in case of the misogynist prick described in OP's post, perhaps there's some underlying reason for his behavior in his past that could be adressed by having a change in perspective after positive interactions with (a) female character(s) in the party. It could be part of a redemption arc/character growth arc that could make for some great material if pulled off correctly. However, if the player didn't even talk about his intentions beforehand and simply does it because he thinks it's funny, then by all means, have his character be curb-stomped by the barmaid. After all, and I think we can all agree to that, \"it's what my character would do\" is not an excuse for everything. Moreover, I fully acknowledge that including darker themes like misogyny and sexual assault is really delicate to pull off. For 95%, maybe even 99% of parties, I would not recommend it and as a DM myself, I probably wouldn't allow it. It's just much easier and creates far less problems if you play a character that is not acting like a total asshole.",

I kind of don't want anyone in my table who needs to be told that to begin with, I'd prefer players who won't default to being fucking creeps without moderation.\n\nExactly!\n\nIf you take the time to address every possible no-go topic or behavior in a session zero, that's all you'll get done doing, for hours, it still won't cover everything, and it's going to set a very hostile and restrictive tone for what should be a very open and creative evening.\n\nNot saying it's bad and should be done...just that I've never felt the need to do it.  Then again I guess I've been lucky compared to some: the worst situation I've had to directly address has been either a heated IC and OOC rivalry turning into aggression in character and hard feelings OOC (that had to be directly addressed)...and one kinda odd time when we had a guy who had his character romantically pursuing another character...it was unrequited, and for a while, it was interesting and amusing, but it got to the point where the player was focusing on it too much and it was making the other player uncomfortable...but even then, a quick but clear and direct OOC message had the intended results.\n\nIn a case like the OP's, my big issue would be that there's a real person at the table with you who *wants to act out something like that*.  Okay, yeah, it's a fantasy/fiction/whatever, I get where you're trying to go with that line of reasoning, but at the end of the day, you decided you wanted a character under your control to do something like that.  And even if I'm not personally traumatized by the subject matter, I'm *abso-fucking-lutely* creeped the fuck out that I'm sitting beside someone who wants to fantasize about that sort of thing in their leisure time...and is okay with bringing the rest of us along for the ride.",

If they solve a riddle, do we make them roll intelligence and say, sorry, your character couldn't think of that. Obviously you have to find a balance between role playing and roll playing, but if we are punishing players who play characters that are smarter or more charismatic than themselves by making them think of what to say, instead of allowing them to roll an ability or skill check, then we should be telling the barbarian player to do a deadlift everyone they want their character to perform a feat of strength.",

However, when such a situation does come up, it is vital to stop and talk about it. Talk about how this makes people uncomfy and that your game isnt that kind of game. You can start talking about consent. \n\nFor example, I usually open a short discussion when I introduce more seductive NPCs. Like once a very seductive npc wanted the blood of my players. Did I just unleash her? No, of course not. I told them that this npc is a bit lewd, but I would want them to express at any time if I was making them uncomfy or I could scrap the NPC altogether if they didnt like it. Also, i didnt force her on anyone; she basically made seductive comments and the players chose to engage themselves. Never had an issue this way. Attitudes and ideas can change after a session zero; sometimes a person just is having a bad day and doesnt want such things, another day it night be okay. So adressing things with a sort of heads-up/ opening a quick discussion in the moment is imo best",

So what, no more fighting/assaulting or even stealing in any campaigns?\n\nIn Dungeons & Dragons, violence is implied by the rules. There are rules for violence, and those rules are engaged with while making a character. There's an entire book of monsters whose main purpose (as expressed by the game rules) is to be on the receiving end of that violence. So agreeing to play Dungeons & Dragons is an implicit agreement that the game will have violence and that everyone is fine with it. The same is not true for sexual assault. \n\n>If for a campaign I desire to explore the choices and psyche of a self-centered psychopath character that will not hesitate to abuse or murder an npc (or even pc) to get what he wants, in the safe environment that an RPG table is, I want to be able to do so.\n\nAnd you can do so! No one is saying that you can't. No one will come to your table and make you stop. But everyone playing should agree that's the type of game they want.\n\nIn OP's example here, everyone agreed there would be violence, and no one agreed that there would be groping. That's the difference. That's why your original comment doesn't point out a contradiction.",

I agree with OP that actions have consequences, however I disagree that this particular action warranted a stronger in-game response than the many other type of violence that happen in a DnD campaign.

Level 20 fighter or barbarian \n\nKooky old shop tender at the magic shop? Level 20 wizard \n\nBarmaid being bothered by clientele? Level 20 monk. \n\nIt always just reminded me of the quote \u201cit\u2019s better to be a soldier in a garden, than a gardener in a war\u201d \n\nThey\u2019ve all retired from a life of adventuring to enjoy the simpler things, they want the comfort and ease of a life in a big city, with their family, etc. \nbut if a player wants to act up, they can quickly remind them \u201cI\u2019m still in business here cuz I can handle myself\u201d\n\nIt also helps to discourage things like the players trying to rob blind the magic shop, because if it was just some old lonely shopkeep it\u2019d be easy. But when you didn\u2019t realize he could at will cast time stop or wish, he\u2019s about to make your lives hell. \n\nThose circumstances, where a player insists upon attacking or hurting an NPC just cuz are about the only time that I view the DM/PC relationship as adversarial. You\u2019re no longer engaging in the communal storytelling going on, you\u2019re doing some cowboy shit, so you better hold on cuz that blacksmith you just tried to intimidate is actually a disguised black dragon, how do you think they keep the forge so hot?
