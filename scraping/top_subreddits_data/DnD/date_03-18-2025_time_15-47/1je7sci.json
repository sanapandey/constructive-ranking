    "selftext": "The few remaining lore scholars on Athas tell legends of these enigmatic creatures that stalk this dying world. The stories lean toward the theory that these quasi-divine beings were once powerful mages. Preservers of a bygone age, who, once they accumulated enough experience, were able to initiate a process of metamorphosis similar to that of powerful defiler mages like the Sorcerer-kings.\n\nThe transformation forced these preservers to pass through a series of steps that lead from human to avangion, but where the defiler metamorphosis is characterized by massive destruction and great pain, the preserver blend is a more serene and peaceful process.\n\nThe transformation is time-consuming and difficult, but ultimately rewarding. A preserver who transforms into an avangion undergoes a series of magnificent changes. In the earliest stages of this metamorphosis, the avangion retains almost all human characteristics. Closer to the ultimate form, the flesh becomes a radiant mass of light and wide, elegant gossamer wings sprout. Eventually, the preserver\u2019s arms and legs become more and more spindly. In the end, their limbs are too delicate for anything but fine manipulation.\n\nThey are effectively immortal. The passage of long periods of time mean nothing to their physical form.\n\nAvangions are not fond of physical combat. They are generally physically weak and depend upon their powerful magic and knowledge to defend themselves.",
