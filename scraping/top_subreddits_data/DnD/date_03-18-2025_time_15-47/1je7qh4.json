    "selftext": "So, I\u2019m pretty new to DnD. Ive done two medium-length campaigns and one longer one with the same group (our DM loves juggling multiple games).\n\nWe all met in college, and i think that everyone but the DM kinda regrets roping me into DnD... lol\n\nA couple people have pointed out that our campaigns always seem to focus on my character\u2019s story, and they\u2019ve mentioned this to me and our DM.  \nBut according to our DM, it\u2019s because the others don\u2019t give him much to work with, and honestly that checks out:  \nI usually provide a pretty detailed backstory and ideas for character development and progression of my character's story, and give important characters, etc. (Im an aspiring novelist.) and our DM loves that I actually collaborate with him on characters, locations, lore, and all that.  \nAnd from what I've seen the others mostly just hand over a character concept and a basic backstory-  \n(our monk is re-flavored to being a medieval style superhero... and thats it, no goal or motivation and he dosent even play into his own backstory becuase he isnt very righteous or heroic, instead he always has to do some public show of bravado... which is how he ACTUALLY is as a person but not the character he claims to be playing.)\n\nWe hang out in Discord a lot, and I\u2019ve noticed the DM trying to rope the others in and give him more to work with for their characters, but they don\u2019t really bite.  \nI think he does a good job of still making an effort to include everyone, but you can tell the others kind of tune out when the focus isn\u2019t on them and then they usually aren\u2019t prepared when he does try to pull them in. Like in the last session he tried to set up a situation for our Superhero monk to swoop in and save someone but he was just like \"man fuck them kids\" and kept playing whatever game he was tabbed into.\n\nAnd when I mentioned to our DM that they don\u2019t seem fully engaged, he basically said:  \n\u201cI can\u2019t force them to play if they don\u2019t want to\u2026 I\u2019m tossing them hooks, but they wont bite any of them.\u201d\n\nAnd I think i may have created some hostility in the last session, I told one of the players he should show our DM more respect by actually paying attention, but the DM brushed it off and said, \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to pay attention, that\u2019s on them.\u201d Still, it\u2019s not exactly fun for me, you know?  \nI even set up my character to have a different view on \u201chonor\u201d than the knight in our party, hoping we\u2019d have a cool discussion that might influence both of our characters, but when I brought it up to that player he basically said: \u201cI\u2019m not taking the game that seriously, man.\u201d\n\nI don't know what im supposed to do in this situation besides also give our DM less to work with....",

            "body": "So it sounds like everyone but you in that game is just there to hang out with friends rather than play DND which is entirely fine and valid, but I think your DM is right, you should just play your game, and let them chime in when they feel like it, if you want a more serious game it sounds like you need a new table.\n\nIt sounds like you have done just about everything you can do, the two pieces of advice I would generally look out for in this situation because I don't have the level of detail to know if relevant or not are as follows\n\n1: when the less engaged players talk, take them seriously and do not talk over them.\n\n2: respond to them and create a back and forth, it looks like they want to goof a bit more, don't be afraid to loosen up and make some jokes, it will likely engage them more, though I fear it might send the game in a direction you don't want if you want a more serious story",

However, if you don't want them to see you as a problematic \"main character player\" my advice is to give them the space when they actively try to take it, and engage with them to try to spread that space. Something needs to fill it though, and you should keep doing that for sure.\n\nEdit: In case there was a misunderstanding what I mean by \"play your game\" is essentially, don't stress about being the main character and continue playing the way you are.",

            "body": "There's nothing wrong with *simplifying* the content you give a DM. I've definitely had players who have given me far too much in the past. So you can tone it down a little without losing the sort of detail you like to provide.\n\nAs a player, it can also help to step back a little and play a mainly support role, maybe occasionally thinking \"here's a challenge, maybe *that* character has the skill we need\" instead of wondering how *you* can handle it.\n\nA few ideas for the DM to encourage more  interaction could be:\n\n* Character questionnaires. Instead of waiting for content, give players a questionnaire at the start of a new campaign asking for specific information. The questions alone can sometimes prompt better responses than \"just make it up\" would.\n* Personal knowledge specialities. Something I tried once was having each character give a specific knowledge speciality for their character - for example the black market, local aristocrats, etc. Then, whenever something needed to be decided such as where to find them, the player could make an Intelligence check, and success meant they got to answer it. That way the player in more engaged with an aspect of their character and involved with world building.\n* Flashback tokens. Something I tried a couple of times when players didn't give me much to *start* with. I let them choose a thin in-game to latch on to and build from there. For example a generic Rogue might wait a while, finally meet a guild master and then latch on, spend their token and have a past rleationship with that master.\n\nA similar idea to the last one there is the secrets of Rime of the Frost Maiden. Have everyone generate or decide on a single secret that only needs to be a sentence. Then the DM can work on incorporating it into a storyline.",

If they aren't interested in playing DnD in a serious or RP/story heavy manner that is completely fine, they aren't obligated to do so. But it is super disrespectful for them to actively avoid putting in any kind of engagement, then complain about the DM not engaging with them. You can be friends and not play DnD together. I would never say to break up the friend group entirely, and frankly I don't think that's what anyone else is saying either. They're saying to stop playing DnD with them. It's pretty clear that you, and likely your DM, want to play a more story-focused campaign, and they don't. The pretty obvious solution is for you and your DM to form a new group with people who want the same thing. You can still be friends and hang out with this group without playing DnD, or like I even suggested, you can form a new group with your interests, and keep up with this campaign, you'll just need to accept that these friends don't want to play the same way you do.",

Sure, there are situations where your other players can shine (and they don't take the bait), but it's not the same as being linked to the story. If the NPCs you meet are from YOUR backstory, how do you expect your other players to contribute equally ? Remember that a campaign doesn't even need backstories to be a good story ; just think of Skyrim.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way, but what you're doing is not your place as a player. You can absolutely help the DM build the plot (hell, I've done it a lot), but it should be linked to your whole party, not one PC in particular. It's the DM's job to plug backstories whenever they feel like it, not yours.\n\nSince all of your fellow players complained, I would recommend you to stop investing yourself in the plot since you perhaps don't know how to detach yourself from your own PC. Either build the story as a DM or play it as a player ; not both.\n\nIf everything fails and there are still frustrations from both sides, you should try finding another group, or you could try DMing (for them or other people).",

The trick is to figure out what the 'it' is that you should talk about.  \nIn this case I believe it's what is mostly recommended as a session zero; What do you want out of this game? What are your expectations? How much are you willing and able to do to meet others expectations?  \nThere are plenty of players that want a hack and slash, others want a power saga and others love the role playing aspect. What is a way that everyone feel is a good way to make it fun for all? Can it be done? Should you perhaps play another game instead or as well to fill some needs? Do someone mostly want to sit in and listen while playing another game simply because they don't want to be left out?\n\nI think you need to dig deeper into this with communication, even if it feels like it will be uncomfortable.

D&D has zero expectations of being a heavy character-focused narrative game; the real story is what happens in the sessions during gameplay, and some players prefer to find out their motivations and personality through play rather than starting out the campaign with a carefully crafted persona. Neither method is best, they're just different approaches to the game, and a DM needs to be able to handle this.\n\nThe players shouldn't be giving the DM \"enough to work with\", showing up should be enough. The DM's job is to present situations for the party to react to, not to craft a novel around their backstories. A backstory in D&D is just that: a backstory. It loosely informs your character's motivations and alignment, but if you want your character to be just a generic fantasy trope without any big ties to the world, you should still be able to come to the session and contribute to the game in a meaningful way.\n\nIf a complex backstory is ESSENTIAL to the campaign the DM has in mind, then he just absolutely talk to each individual player and help them craft the type of story he is looking for, because if you expect something out of character creation that was never really stated as obligatory, then punishing the players for it is just pure entitlement.",

One of their flaws was wrongly accusing someone of a crime, and that came back to bite them... hard. (They loved it) The others just played. We're all RL friends, and it was good times, but I really wish the other players had invested a little more time to give me ways to integrate them into the game properly. \n\nI've since converted the homebrew over to PF2e and am playing with new friends online with it, and some of them have given less than the first group, which is sad.

If they say something like \"You talk too much\" (Something I'm probably guilty of a LOT when I play) then let them talk for the next few sessions.

The other players seemed in agreement.\n\nI think what I brought to the game can be broken up into a few different chunks:\n\n- first, I know the system. I made smart decisions and I made them quickly. I helped the adjudication process at much as possible so my character's mechanical contributions to the game were meaningful and streamlined.\n\n- second, I'm decent at the theatrical/narrative aspect of the game. I don't just mean that I was funny or talked with a silly voice; that's part of it, sure. But I'm also just very aware of tone and storytelling and all that stuff, so my character was respectively funny, scared, heartfelt, etc at the time when it was appropriate to be so. My acting served to augment the game as a whole--I'd see what the GM was doing and I'd support it.\n\n- third, I applied both of these first two points to the other players.\n\nI tried to help out mechanically when I could. Which can be hard, because I absolutely don't want to come across as rules lawyer-y or like I'm stepping on the GM's toes. It was usually encouraging questions like, \"your DC is 17, right?\" or \"didn't you just get that new ability when we leveled up?\" or tableside cheerleading, \"32 damage?! You're a *beast*!\", \"that might have just won us this fight!\", \"only you could have talked your way out of that one!\"\n\nAnd I try to identify what the other players are conveying with their PCs and support that. My character was initially intimidated by the towering dragon-man, but would tell NPCs that he was really very kind and gentle. The mysterious stranger who had powers that seemed to come from beyond the grave? My character made a point to stay on their good side, and I said as much outright to the player of the spooky guy. My favorite was probably the regal elven knight; I'd say things like, \"are you sure *we* were chosen by destiny to do all this? I mean, I get why Fate would choose *him*--he looks like he stepped out of a painting! But I'm not sure if I'm really the save-the-world type...\"\n\nSo yeah, I think you can play a really real, grounded, well-developed, likeable character with almost nothing to go off of.\n\nBut.\n\nI think it also depends on how much of the narrative is GM-driven versus player-driven. If the GM wants to react to player action more than the players react to GM action, it can be harder.\n\nBut it kind of sounds like your GM is aiming for lots of player-driven elements, except you're the only one driving.",

Just because of this, I wouldn\u2019t make the main plot centered around the 1-2 characters that did provide a lot of backstory and info, because it will inevitably lead to a main character feel. IMO player backstory should be side quest or roleplay material at most so that every player has a chance to feel engaged with the more main plot. In this specific scenario you are describing I don\u2019t think this matters much because no one is engaged so you might as well have your story be at the forefront.
