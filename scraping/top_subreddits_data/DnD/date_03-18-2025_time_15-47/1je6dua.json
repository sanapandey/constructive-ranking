I guess it is true that much goes unspoken in martial arts. But allow me to try to provide words where there are none. Each step you see her take there, they are the steps to a dance, notes on a sheet of music, practised and rehearsed. They are the brush on a canvas. Every stroke bears the history of thousands of souls that endeavoured to embrace pain for beauty. Her body is tempered with a discipline most will never attain. Every scar etched on her body, sign of mental and physical fortitude. It stands now as a bastion of will, to overcome all else. And yet, such a mind and body, hardened by victory and defeat, still moves with the grace of the wind. The silence of still water. Every strike cracks bone and every breath soothes dragons. It is balance in all things. Mastering such a balance could be nothing other than art.",
