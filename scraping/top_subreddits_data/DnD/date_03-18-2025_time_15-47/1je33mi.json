So I set out to design an equivalent product I could 3d print. I was pleased with the end result!\n\nI made the files [free to download here](https://makerworld.com/models/1207129) if you want to check them out. I designed it so that you can load up the file in your slicer (I used Bambu studio) to customize the text on the letter or add an STL for the wax seal logo. But if you wanted, DM me and I could make a custom one for you to print instead!",

Mother Earth is weeping.\n\nETA: as I say, my girlfriend uses sealing wax every day. I know candle wax is not the same, but for a 20 second prop moment it has worked for me in the past.

Obviously paper is still the better option. \n\nBut, in general, studies are out on whether PLA breaks down into traditional microplastics or hydrolyzes into smaller molecules. It would seem the presence of moisture causes it to breakdown and degrade into tinier particles.  \n\nIn industrial composting conditions PLA can take anywhere from 30-60 days. Outside of such conditions closer to a few hundred years vs petroleum based plastics 500-1000 years. Whether or not OP is in an area where they have access to industrial composting is above my knowledge, but in general we need more sites for industrial composting.\n\nA standard desktop 3D printer used about 300 watts, which is similar pull to something like a radio or TV. Obviously there a lot more factors like filament type, enclosed vs non enclosed printers, and run time but in general a 3D printer\u2019s electricity usage is comparable to running a few incandescent lightbulbs in your home.\n\nEdit: days not years",

You can put paper in coffee or dark tea, leave it in for a few minutes, pull it out, let it dry and repeat if you want it to be darker.\n\nA different method is using lemon juice (maybe diluted with water for lighter colored paper) and then ironing or baking (very shortly) the paper sheet.\n\nEither method will be way easier and cheaper than 3D printing paper...\n\nAs for the wax, you could just buy sealing wax and 3d print the stamp. Generally you need to put something on the stamp to avoid having it stick on the wax (oil or water or sth depending on the wax you use) but it shouldn't be too hard. 200 pieces of sealing wax cost 8$ on Amazon so it doesn't really cost much and you can also grab a melting spoon while you are at it.  \n\n\nPS you can also print the paper before staining it, but you need to be more careful to avoid smudges",

You don't need to justify it, OP - I think some of the negativity in here is coming from the rather contrived \"reasons\" you were giving for why you \"had\" to do it this way. But you don't need reasons! You're good at 3D modeling and wanted to play with your 3D printer, and that's all the reason you need!",
