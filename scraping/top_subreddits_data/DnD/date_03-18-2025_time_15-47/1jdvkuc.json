They asked him to throw a bomb on the trigger of a word, and the DM said the word 100% by accident, it was hilarious. Anyways my character kept them and what to his mind was their puppy eyes to add them to the traveling circus he was part of. Gary is NOT the real name of the goblin, but go explain that to a hunking 7' beefy boy that will throw you anyway as an improvised weapon to enemies.",

Needless to say, she was confused, concerned, and speechless from it. It was flavored as me tossing her into the air, catching her and escaping.\n\nThe \"how squishy are you?\" became one of the highlights of the session, and one of the funniest moments, along sides me saying: \"...and this is my friend Isis!\" Everyone was DYING at that.
