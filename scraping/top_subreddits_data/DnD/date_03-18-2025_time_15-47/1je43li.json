And any totally new adventures need to be accessed from a position where the players have the choice to follow it or not.

Champion fighter(13)\n\n3: every other Friday HB campaign : Valiant Goodfellow, the naive overly positive half Deva Aasimar on his first actual \"calling\" hes gone on his own, since his mom just died of old age. Redemption Paladin(10) that things no one is above redemption, though for some the only path to redemption begins with a trip to the hells.\n\n4: Every other Saturday Storm Kings Thunder(2024 rules) : Blaze Brightborn, light cleric(5) obsessed with getting to do as many heroic and good deeds but has the WORST temperament(8 charisma). Inspired heavily by Bakugo from My Hero Academia and Schmidt from new girl.\n\n5: Monthly HB : Prince(the Prince of Dragons) dragonborn dragon monk(13). Offspring of tiamat that rejects her and is going around rebeling and doing as much good as possible entirely out of spite. Also has a SHITTY abrasive personality as he is constantly fighting against every dragon instinct to kill pillage and horde. He hoards good deeds instead of gold now.\n\n6: Monthly HB: Hugh Normelman \"Inventor at Large\", custom lineage but definitely a total normal human so dont question him. Armorer artificer(6) tank with dual wielder to taunt more enemies a turn. He gets to a death save most fights because the build didn't turn out as tanky as I hoped lol\n\n7: Weekly Phandelver: Manny Slashwell, the human fighter(1). This one just had session 0 yesterday.

But I'm really excited about it.\n\nThe kids' campaign I honestly just make up as I go, throwing random monsters at them, simplistic dungeons, an overkill of magical items.  But with their attention span, we might play a few weekends in a row, we might skip weekends for a month, and we usually only play for like 2 hours at a time.  The 12 yr old is the one who's REALLY excited about playing, but mostly because he watches D&D videos and memes and just wants to cast Fireball at everything.",
