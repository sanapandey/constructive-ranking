Moving costs resources, even in a fantasy world. Moving is dangerous. Sure, an evil Lich might syphon your soul, but a wolf might also rip out your throat on your way to the next kingdom. You likely aren't a survival expert and might starve or eat something spoiled or poisonous and shit your guts out in a bush. If your child *somehow* gets mummy rot on the way, you're fucked. \n\nThere's also always lesser, smaller evil. A lot of people start moving out of Lichville? Well, here come the brigands. Hand over your gold. Your horse. Your daughter. Who's gonna help you, the mayor a county over who hasn't made a move again the Lich? The Lich's personal forces? Don't be ridiculous. He might make sure there's *law and order* in the streets of Lichville, but out there it's the wild west. \n\nPeople also become complacent. \"Oh, the Lich has actually been really good to us. Ever since he has enslaved the druidic enclave, The lifestock and crops are thriving\". Some might even actually take part. \"Yeah sure he sends us out to collect virgin sacrifices, but he has a really good training regime, the food is good and in a few years I can be captain of the guard, and their armors look so cool!\" \n\nChildren born under the Lich's regime might not even see anything wrong with it - \"what are a few sacrifices per village every other year compared to the benefits of his protection and the magic we get to learn!\"\n\nOr you just might not wanna give up your homeland? Maybe you really love the place and wanna protect it. Maybe there's a bunch of guerilla freedom fighters. That shit is dangerous business but it's also not unheard of.",

Like if you're a farmer, packing up your family and livelihood to try to settle in a new area is pretty difficult to begin with. If the land is granted to you by your lord, then you have no other option but then to farm the land you are allotted.\n\nEven if they could pick up and leave and reasonably expect to find work in a new land because of skills or something, other kingdoms may not be welcoming to them. Besides just the laws and attitudes regarding immigrants and refugees, let's say that you've got some people showing up from another kingdom that is 100% known as the 'evil kingdom'. You might feel bad for their plight and sympathize with them as refugees. But if this evil overlord is a warmonger, how do you know that these refugees are not spies? Or the first covert advance of an enemy army.\n\nIn general, throughout history, leaving your homeland was incredibly difficult, for a number of reasons.

Moving is an incredibly stressful endeavor that most people hate, and most of the time we depend on family and friends to help us spread the burden of loading and unloading. Moving away from a region, especially a large region where all your family and friends are, sacrifices the loss of help even in the modern era where there are moving companies.\n\nEconomically it is quite costly and that cost increases with the distance moved. Leaving terrible conditions behind, including freedoms and rights being eroded, often means a loss of value. In dark times it becomes harder to sell property and possessions when everyone is afraid for the future.\n\nLife isn\u2019t easy and sometimes moving to a better place at the cost of family and friends is too high a price.
