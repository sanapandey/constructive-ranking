For example, the character is hit by Death Cultist's Dread Scythe attack and he \"can't regain Hit Points until the end of its next turn.\" Do you tell this to the player that was hit, do you let the healer in the party know, is the healer metagaming if you tell only the character that was hit, or do you wait until the healer tries to heal before letting them know the spell failed to restore Hit Points.",

It doesn't appear to be causing further damage, but it's immediately evident to an experienced eye that it may interfere with restorative magics.\"\n\nI think it's unlikely these effects would not have visual tells, and I also think it's unlikely a healer would be unable to recognize these tells, but I frame the information from the perspective of those visual tells, rather than dropping straight into RPG speak. I likely would not betray the duration however; they will learn the duration when the visual effect fades and I describe that.",

It might be undetectable until you attempt to heal. It might leave a necrotic veil with unknown effects. It might be recognizable by someone trained in healing or necrotic magic. It might require arcane rolls.\n\nAll these are valid options imo, but generally I prefer to give players more information than less. Rolling an ability is a good idea too.",

When their turn finally comes up and you let them try to heal and then tell them it doesn't work, you more or less skipped their turn and now their waiting another 20 minutes before they can attempt to do anything.

Not being able to heal and having your move speed reduced are pretty integral parts of how your character plays.\n\nFor me the line really depends on the *type* of effect that is effecting the player. I'd tell a caster if they walked into an Antimagic Field, but not if they walked into a Forbiddance unless one of the characters had a specific connection to another plane of existence.\n\nBecause magic in general is way more integral to your player than being able to teleport or conjure things is.\n\nBut this is largely because of how I personally like to build tension, more than anything concrete. As I said in the previous comment, whatever works for each table and DM will be different.\n\nPs. The guy I replied to *literally* said he *would* do those \"slippery slope\" examples I brought up, so I guess I kinda hit the nail on the head eh? He sees healing & move speed similar to each other, and treats them consistently. Which is exactly what I was asking about xD\nAnd honestly, good for him, that does sound like an interesting way to DM",
