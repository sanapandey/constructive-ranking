A broken shrine stands atop rocky cliffs, while collapsed pillars and walls hint at long forgotten stories. Trees and boulders cast deep shadows, as if something was ready to jump out and ambush you at any point.\n\nThis map, which features elevation, walls for cover and an old altar, is a great place for some spellcasting ambush! Maybe a horde of zombies, or maybe the summoning of forest guardians that needs some protection?\n\nA gridded variant of this map is available on my\u00a0[patreon\u00a0](https://www.patreon.com/posts/roadside-ruins-124617792?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link)for FREE.
