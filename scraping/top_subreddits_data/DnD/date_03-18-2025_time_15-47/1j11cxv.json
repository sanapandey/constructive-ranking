Even tho my portfolio is oriented to the games, i am capable of doing stand alone character/prop/creature illustrations, very much interested in table top games (as a passionate dnd player). Also i am not afraid of different thematic, the weirder the better in my opinion (gives space for creativity).  \n  \nIf you are interested, you can find my portfolio here: [https://www.artstation.com/saritos](https://www.artstation.com/saritos)  \nfor stand alone illustrations, commission page is here: [https://saritos-art.carrd.co/#commission](https://saritos-art.carrd.co/#commission)   \n(***Revolut*** only due to PayPal being greedy corpo)\n\nif you have long term project like building a board game or such, then contact me via e-mail to discuss about pricing: [sarapregel@gmail.com](mailto:sarapregel@gmail.com) \n\nthanks for reading and excited to meet ya! :D",
