I\u2019m alternating between more usable generic maps and less usable but more interesting (theme wise at least) maps which has been very good for my overall workload (and mental health lol).\n\nNext map will be a rather intense Feywild location, so be on the lookout for that one if you\u2019re adventuring in said Feywild. After that is a pack of 3 generic maps, and so on and so forth. I am currently working on my largest and most ambitious map yet, not sure when I\u2019ll get that out since I don\u2019t wanna rush it, but its gonna be wild.\n\nAnyway, hope at least some of you can use this somewhere, if you want a feywild and/or snow variant, as well as a Foundry Module, check here: [https://www.patreon.com/posts/123141412](https://www.patreon.com/posts/123141412)\n\nHappy adventuring!\n\nKrane",
