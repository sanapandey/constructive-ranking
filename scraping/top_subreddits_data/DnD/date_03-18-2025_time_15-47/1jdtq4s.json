She fell because she saw no other way to win this thing. She is not wearing skimpy armor, no, why the fuck WOULD she? She has battle armor and a flaming sword and she will kill you repeatedly if you piss her off. Also if you kill any of the local big bads someone else takes their place. Shit is BAD here. And what is your punishment for being caught? No rape or mutilation or that shit. Nope, we need bodies for the meat grinder: you're being drafted baby! Go fight some demons! Or other devils! Go use your class levels and magic items and play this game the way it is neant to be played!\"\n\nIts a grimdark setting with built-in guardrails for how the setting logic works.",

There is nothing more terrifying than the unknown, and nothing you can conjure and subscribe will be scarier than what your players come up with in their own mind. Give them a cave with noises coming from it, and they will fill it with their deepest darkest fears.\n\nPlayers being in a supposedly safe house torn apart by skeletons is scary. It's even scarier when the skeletons break through, and drag someone out of the building into the dark while they scream.\n\nPlayers walking and finding a house torn apart with skeletons, with chips of bone scattered around as the skeletons wore their own hands down to nothing pounding at the walls? The lack of any (recent) corpses, but fading blood trails leading to the tall fields of wheat nearby, slowly fading as the party finds marks in the dirt as people desperately clawed at the ground? The blood trail going cold near deep depressions in the mud, as if something enormous landed and then took off again?\n\nNow that is fucking *terrifying*.

Something I've homebrewed into a run of Rime of the Frostmaiden is a bigger presence from Auril (since she's kinda a do-nothing in the base book). I started by having animals with glowing blue features observer the players from afar, then dropped tokens of characters from their backstory who had disappeared. I started making the animals with glowing features more and more aggressive, and finally, once my players got the the black cabin, I paid off the buildup by having two backstory characters attack the party as reanimated coldlight walkers. With that party I've still got three more coldlight walkers made from backstory characters and I'm waiting for the right moment to pull those out. \n\nThis all had the effect I'm going for. Not only do my players consider Auril a major threat, but they *haaaaaate* her and want to take her down.",

            "body": "The DM of this one game I was in during my time in college made a world literally built around an entire cast of OP DMPCs. The context is that in this world, about a couple decades before the campaign began, a team of super powerful adventurers crafted divine weapons with ludicrously powerful effects to kill Tiamat who had managed to manifest on the mortal plane. These weapons were insane, we're talking bows that can automatically hit anyone on any plane of existance, greatswords that can let you, as a free action, walk into any plane of existance, wands that can canonically cast 10th level spells, etc. The world was peaceful after this, and the party of heroes went their seperate ways afterwards. \n\nThis peace was shattered when a half dragon/half god warlord BBEG, decided that he had enough of the gods and started going around killing all these super powerful heros to become a super god and destroy heaven (and maybe all life, his plan was never fully laid out to us). the BBEG killed the first hero we met right in front us, taunted the whole town and left, and we were expected to go and inform all the other heroes they were being hunted. The heros, despite their OP as hell magic items, all proved in time to be utterly useless sacks of shit who died unceremoniously almost everytime we ran into them. The BBEG was so OP, the one fight we had with him before the finale had the DM inform us \"He looks like he only just reached 4 digits of HP\". Yeah, you read that right, he started the fight with over 10,000HP. It was insanity what our party of level 6s at the time were expected to deal with.\n\nThe campaign went from insane plot beat to insane plot beat as he described these glorious heroes and their super cool weaposn, then how the BBEG mopped the floor with them, mostly offscreen. This all ended though, because my character (a wizard) decided he had had enough. I first asked the DM \"How much does my character know about other planes of existance?\", he asked for an arcana check, 28. \"He knows everything there is to know about the planes of existence\", so I hatched a devious scheme. I approached the BBEG, and made him a bargain. My character told him that he knew of a great plane where he could stock up on power for his war against heaven, he just had to listen to me. Despite all of his new god tier magic items, he was at his base just a normal warrior, so he was mostly clueless about what wasn't on the mortal plane, so he took my offer. Using the greatsword of free planar travel, I asked him to take us to the Plane of Negative Energy. As the BBEG looked around confused, I cast Hold Monster (we were level 9 at the end) on him right as the Voidstones devoured us both, ending the madness. We were right at the end of the semester before summer break, so the DM just rolled with my plan during the final session because he also wanted to wrap everything up. The rest of the party lived and he ruled that my wizard's soul was whisked off to Elysium in his final moments for his selfless sacrifice.\n\nWhile we don't play with that DM anymore, the rest of that group from college still plays online, and we sometimes reference this campaign. That BBEG has shown up as a secret endboss in multiple campaigns since, in increasingly ludicrous scenarios each time. Stuck in a sphere of negative energy, reincarnated as an ancient red dragon, etc. Somehow I have been the one who killed him every single time, which has also become a running joke in our group.",

I was also given some sort of sword which let me channel multiple spells of any level or type into it as an action, then later cast them all at once without expending slots. This eventually just turned into me vaguely describing what I wanted to do, spitballing a few spells that could allow me to do it, and then just handwaving the rules in order to make it work. By the way, I wasn\u2019t even the most powerful character at the table!

I told the king he was fixing it. He said he didn't have anyone who could cast the spell. I said he had a whole council of high level adventurers. He said Regenerate required a diamond (it doesn't). I said we saved his life so he could pay for it. He said he didn't have one. I said then he'd better fucking find one because we just pulled his ass out of a demon goo cave so he's either fixing her arm or he's going back in.\n\n\nAnd so my wife got a magic prosthetic. :)",

Supposedly the entire world was at war between every single race, which meant that everyone thought our mixed-race party was a bunch of traitors. We kept getting locked up in prisons as a result\n\n#3. There was a huge war between dragons going on in the background that the DM wanted us to be invested in, but we were too scared to do anything\n\n#4. The burning hands incident, where the DM ruled that a burning hands spell cast at full gallop on a horse multiplied the AOE effect of Burning Hands by the number of feet traveled. This is how a level 1 Wizard killed an entire horde of goblins (over 1000) with a single burning hands spell, and we didn't even level up\n\n#5. In the first region we visited as a party after the tutorial sessions, everyone was invisible. That was it, that was the gimmick. We were invisible, enemies were invisible, etc. \n\n#6. The BBEG had 64 total hit points and we accidentally killed him during our first fight with him\n\n#7. The DM made it so that a natural 1 on any attack caused it to hit an ally in range. This included NPCs. Also, NPCs worked like in video games so if you hit them once they hated you forever.\n\nIt was a wild ride",

The world was basically a big hemisphere, but I don't remember if it just ended at the edges or if there was some outer plane bs going on there.\n\nAfter that campaign was over, I took over for my first time DMing and basically added another hemisphere to the existing setting. Explained it in-universe as a merging of planes similar to the whole Abeir-Toril Spellplague thingy. The new hemisphere was full weeaboo bs, with such tired tropes as an emperor who was a polymorphed gold dragon, a country populated by tribes of nomads who ride horses, a continent that was actually the back of a giant turtle, and a number of super powerful immortal beings who each held a part of whatever macguffin I'd thought up. One of the immortals was also just straight up my 20th level PC from the last campaign.\n\nThe cringiest part of all was my villain. Does anyone remember Zalgo, the dumb creepypasta meme from the mid-2000s? Yeah, it was just that character, full stop. Wanted to take over the world or something.

The basics is our party is a strike team for the city guard.  We have a paladin, a rogue, I think a sorcerer, me as an artificer, and a barbarian.\n\nSession 1 we end up in a village called Mango\u2026known for their mangoes.  We get a plot hook of someone using mind control crystals.  We only face two people under control.  A kid and his grandma.  We find the one using the crystals. A flame warrior.  We destroy it, get info on a bbeg.  Suddenly the crystals all break\n\nNext session, we\u2019re completely ignoring that mind control crystals thing.  We find out that J Jonah Jameson is our direct commander, and Peter Parker is his assistant.  We get sent to meet up with a contact for more information on this crime kingpin.  It\u2019s Avdol.  Were directed to a bar.  Inside we run into shady types, including a Dragonborn sized Godzilla.  But, no chance to interact, do anything.  We confront one of the kingpin\u2019s top enforcers, Conquest.  Again, win rather easily.  Guy has so far sent opponents one by one against a party of five, and is relying mainly on high AC.  We capture him alive, Joseph Joestar hands us a bottle of wine as thanks for stopping this guy.  \n\nNow I get the feeling the plot\u2019s gonna change again.",

Despite him wanting to \"take the early levels slow\", we immediately jump to level 2 because he's afraid of how frail we are.\n* We have to track missing kids in the local woods. Every 10 or so feet, we're told we have to make new perception checks to continue tracking (remember this one, it'll come back in a minute)\n* We find some ancient temple in the woods, proceed in to check for lost children. Inside, it's a half dozen empty hallways before we get to a \"puzzle\" room\n* The room is a locked(?) door and a totem pole thing that's shooting firebolts at us\n* Party struggles to deactivate trap, we're at like half health from attempting various attacks/skill checks\n* Eventually we brute force it, DM laughs and tells us \"all you had to do was put a rock in there or something [no roll required] to block it\" with a tone like we're fucking idiots (yet we couldn't walk 15ft previously without needing to roll for our eyes to work...?)\n* Next room, we get into another combat. I pull out my light crossbow (which I sold all my starting gear to be able to afford, including other weapons). My *first* attack is a nat 1. DM tells me the crossbow breaks, full stop. Cannot work anymore, I'll \"have to buy a new one\".\n* Seeing as there's no vendors in the dungeon, I block all the other players and the DM on discord and roll20, and leave both session and server mid combat.\n\nIf nothing else, it makes for a fun horror story but yeah... I don't even remember the lore beyond the crayon drawing because the DM always struggled to reply with answers to simple questions about his 'super fleshed out' world.",

I made it clear I needed it tested as is. He goes and changes stuff in my system without telling me and blind sides me during the next session. Long story short, I took my system away and recommended that we just switch to 5e.\n\nWe switch to 5e, but the dm doesn't want classes in the game still. He decides that, as a first time dm, he has the know-how and experience to remove classes from 5e and make his own. The guy is lazy too, so he makes the beginnings of 3 classes. there abilities are too focused on combating specifically zombies and provide no benefits when fighting other types of enemies, and none of this stuff written down so we the players can look at it and decide what build we want to make. So game play balance goes out the window since dnd enemies are balanced around the preexisting classes.\n\nGame dies after 9 sessions. I gave him a lot of advice, he didn't listen to any of it.",

Also half the time he'd only take a general glance at stat blocks/spell descriptions, so at times we were told to be stealthy we would instantly be spotted because \"The mind flayers always have Detect Thoughts up and sensed you through the wall you're behind. Make the save for Mind Blast\"\n\n\\-Midway through the campaign the mind flayers somehow (literally never explained in or out of game) sever the connection between the Prime Material Plane and the \"Plane of Healing\", so our characters couldn't naturally heal from normal long rests and instead had to use the Gritty Realism rest rules. When questioning why he sprung this on us the DM revealed that he wanted us to effectively have an X-COM style roster of PCs to bring out whenever our mains were too injured/stuck in recovery. My Bard/Warlock (the only caster/healer in the party) swiftly smashed that to bits since DM explicitly stated only natural healing was on GR rules; not spell slot recovery, so I could top everyone up in a matter of short rests... This did lead to every enemy to have specific \"anti-mage\" homebrew features and items (tho the items always were \"too damaged\" for the party to use/fix after combat)\n\n\\-Nearly every npc had class levels and were always at least 2-5 levels higher than the party average. The Emperor of the region we were in was a level 15 Barbarian/Battle Master and his court wizard was a level 20 Wizard capable of casting Wish (Who then became a level 30 Wizard/Sorcerer after we defeated the Mind Flayers and he became the bbeg)\n\n\\-Also for some reason DM had the biggest hate-boner for Wood Elves. Like, every instance of \"Fantasy Racism\u2122\" that happened was only ever directed towards the Wood Elf PCs.",

Eventually, I gave up and just deleted the sword from my inventory when he wasn't looking and forgot about it.\n\n* I waited about 2 hours into the first session for my character to be introduced. I was immediately cornered by some sort of shadow monster in a library that was silenced, so the only spell I could cast was minor illusion. In hindsight, this may have been what the sword was for, but, again, deleted and forgotten about. I had to beg for the overpowered DMPC to one-shot the monster for me.\n\n* By the way, there was an overpowered DMPC. I think they were on the Empire's side, and they were the one gathering the party together. Details are kind of fuzzy, but I remember them doing a few \"test swings\" of their weapon in the Roll20 and doing over 100 damage.\n\n* After the library incident, my wizard was kidnapped and put on a train to the plot. \n\nDidn't go back for session 2.

The campaign truly derailed when we reached a town of witches that turned out to be children tortured to later be turned in to said witches. My character got raped in this witch town. Also every NPC was a League of Legends skin-portrait. I remember once we got out of the witch town, there was a moment where we polymorphed into flies and our rogue rolled a 30 on their stealth check only to be noticed by an NPC who apparently had 30+ passive perception and knew instantly that the random fly was our rogue. Oh and I forgot to add that the DM forced his own shitty homebrew subclasses upon us as a \"side-tree\" that could give us stronger abilities. Apparently our DM thought that DnD was poorly balanced and that most classes were boring despite never having played it and only ever been DM:ing. He still makes terrible homebrew to this day, thankfully we no longer have any contact. He was in general quite the terrible person, really edgy and wanted to insert himself and his weird fantasies in to everything. Every single time he's been a player in a campaign I was also in, he would aggressively try to romance my characters.",

You'd think someone who makes up stuff everyday could create a cohesive narrative/world, but ofc he didn't. Some highlights of the three session campaign before I quit:\n- Detect magic never worked because the magic \"has just left\"\n- Nat 20s on persuasion didn't do much. Even if you're asking the Magic Item collecting mayor, who's son you've already saved and you're now after his daughter, for a cheap one, no. Not even to help the quest. \n- \"These are new monsters, they'll be released in a new book that comes out next week!\" Highly inconsistent ac, they would only multi attack if the first attack hit and they had legendary actions against lvl 2 characters. They were not boss monsters.\n- He clearly wanted us to follow his intended path, but for the life of me, we couldn't find it. Every NPC was annoyed because the DM was annoyed, so nobody told us anything. We circled the only three locations multiple times and he just sat back and smirked as we \"wondered around in his mystery.\" He'd still be commenting with stuff like: \"Well alright, if that's where you wanna go...\" and then not guide us in any way. \n- He had a riddle which was supposed to play out exactly the way it was in his mind. I figured it out pretty quickly so I said: \"A CANDLE!\" I hovered the item around candles, discussed it thoroughly with my party for the most frustrating 15 minutes of my life until we finally probed the solution out of him: \"You said 'a candle', but you never said 'candle' to the book.\" Me: \"But I said it out loud?\" DM: \"But you didn't specify it was in character\"\n\nI'm just gonna leave it there, but there was a lot more going on.

            "body": "Played in a campaign where the DM ran a weird homebrew version of Inspiration that used a deck of cards that were sort of like tarot cards. At the beginning of each session, and whenever we RP'd well enough for him to award inspiration, we would draw a card. Some gave healing potions, some gave custom magic items the DM created, some gave temporary buffs like granting the effects of _Magic Weapon_ without casting it, etc etc etc. And honestly, I thought it was cool.\n\nThe campaign was set to take place in the homebrew world the DM had created; I also thought it was a *good* sign that he had a 30-40 page document about the setting and his versions of the societies of the various D&D races/heritages. \n\nWell, as I'm sure some people reading this have already guessed, it turned out that we were playing through what he wanted to be his novel. Incredible amounts of railroading in both social and combat scenarios was the norm, and we were all but forced into the employ of a NPC (read: DMPC/self-insert) that we were assured knew everything we wanted to know.\n\nWe're talking important stuff that would have progressed our character's motivations. And yet this NPC kept telling us that it wasn't time for him to share that info with us. He was super musclebound, extremely attractive and well-dressed. He could just wave his hand and teleport the entire party around and he would regularly paralyze our entire party without any outward sign of casting anything.\n\nI almost quit in like session 2 after I used my Artificer's Magical Tinkering to make a copy of a map that showed the precise last known location of my character's missing brother. It was the literal entire reason my character started adventuring. We got back to the main hub our characters had been using and I went to show someone the map and the DM told me I didn't have it because, quote: \"You never specified that you picked it back up.\"\n\nI only stayed because I liked the other party members and I didn't want the campaign to crumble on them because I quit.\n\nThe final straw came shortly after being put into several encounters that were, in hindsight, unwinnable. My character died in one of them, and another player's PC and mine had a burgeoning romance. (One that was both consensual and had been planned before the campaign actually started.) They weren't having fun with their character because the DM was messing with how Wizards copied spells into their books and how they learned spells on level up. Since they were romantically involved with my character and not enjoying the character, they responded to my death by dropping a *Fireball* at their own feet while they had single-digits HP. And they specifically said their intention was to commit suicide due to the helplessness of the situation.\n\nWe players actually had a Discord call between sessions where we all agreed that it wasn't going well, but we decided to give the DM one last chance, so the whole party rolled up some new characters for the next session. \n\nThe DM opened the session in an infirmary where the Wood Elf woke up, having been healed. But the rest of the other PCs were all still dead. The campaign ended in the next minute when that player confirmed we were several stories up and that there was a window in the room - before jumping out of it.",

I had a grand overarching story, and ended up getting so caught up in big plot beats that the players never really got the small moments that make DND campaigns shine. I ran a few more homebrews, and eventually encountered Tales of the yawning portal. I fell in love with premade modules so fast \nI think there are AWESOME as a DM resource, and anytime I see that somebody is running a module, I immediately have confidence that they are a good DM, and that they're in it for the love of the game, not to show off their setting and story (because stories like that usually result in heavy railroading and lack of character choice). When I hear about a homebrew setting, I encounter drastic rule changes, DMs super original character who is oh so cool, unclear direction, and DM frustration.\nTLDR Homebrew settings are either the best or worst DND, and most people would be better off running modules",

The local \u201cpolice\u201d also hates adventurers because were basically vigilantes but we don\u2019t need to worry about laws and they can\u2019t stand us\u2026.yet we have a whole ass school and campus in the town so they regularly buy heads with us on everything. Do some school work via like class tournament where the dm allotted us prep time to do essentially capture the flag, the subsequently meta\u2019d the opposing teams strategy to exactly counter ours (this is a common reoccurring theme of him always having the enemy counter us or our plans being fails from the start). After that find out there\u2019s \u201cothers\u201d essentially doppelg\u00e4ngers trying to pod people their way into society to assist in taking over, person who wanted to take over was some dude who made a warlock pact with heckna so had to do a whole segment of trying to find proof to expose this socialite who was running for mayor as the bbeg (one of the campaigns bad guys it gets worse from here). This leads to a whole spread out through the city and find evidence segment where our party was split with one team going after some evidence in the sewers and another checking out the graveyard. Graveyard team found essentially the pod people laboratory sewer team was attacked and 2/3 were replaced by imposters that were very obvious but we couldn\u2019t call them out because plot. We video Record the evidence to bring to the police After we find the mayors daughter in one of the pods partially transformed then we have a whole infiltration into a theater because they\u2019re supposed to be a secret auction held him he said that the socialite sells items through so we were trying to capture and expose him find out that literal Heckna is there So we do the whole infiltration bid it turns into a surprise reveal that there\u2019s a continuation  of the ritual from the school happening where there\u2019s a bunch of tieflings at the school  that apparently have constellation formations on their skin because they are descendants of an extra special race of astrology powered beings and their represented descendants have the constellations as markings on their skin. The ritual being to try and get their ancestors who were in prison and in the astral plane for being \u201ctoo powerful and evil\u201c to possess their descendants body and to control them I think it was. It\u2019s at this point in time that we find out there are two opposing forces in the campaign behind the shadows the order of order and the order of chaos ironically. Cue long and miserable sequence of fights To rescue our friends and captured students before the ritual completes expending all of our resources but also putting vending machines throughout the place for us to spend gold to get items to restore a spell slot or some health and after we stop the ritual this guys warlock patron decides the show must go on and transformed him into some monstrosity with the explicit purpose of reality warping and destroying everything with an a massive distance so we then go into a final fantasy 14 style Bossfight with several stages of mini events we have to do before we get to the final fight which was an uphill battle because the DM decided to put in a mechanic where the enemy was chanting and if they finished the chant it was an automatic game over so we\u2019re all panicking trying to damage this thing to stop it but we\u2019re level seven and six trying to fight a literal avatar of a god so anything we do is causing little to no damage and we are also trying to rescue people as it\u2019s destroying buildings and wrecking the place. So I get the brilliant idea to use my artificers skills to overclock a trolley to ramming speed it into him I make the insane DC check that he placed for it (another reoccurring theme of having impossible to pass dcs and always against the player doing it\u2019s worst stat) figuring that I blew myself up in the process because of how much explosion he put into it that would make Michael Bay blush and then we had to deal with the rebuilding of the town to which we were doing that and also continuing another school tournament because it was the \u201csports festival\u201d you know we gotta do stuff for school guys so we can justify existing. Which led us to finding out that some of the police were corrupt because surprise my character was almost framed for the murder of one of the police we were in contact with I managed to heal them and have a literal solo segment or trying to sneak them out of the area being ACTIVELY RAIDED by corrupt swat team so helicopters and humvees managed to do it some how. Surprise police chief is corrupt but not in the way we thought he\u2019s a member of the order of order so are some of his cops who wanted to kill 2 of our students 1 who had a shapeshifting sword which apparently was part of the god for the order of order and the other who was housing part of the god of chaos. Yeah apparently part of this whack ass plot was 2 of the players were gonna be \u201csecret\u201d bbegs depending on how we took care of things. They were both informed separately of the possibility while the rest of us didn\u2019t know. So we end up killing them and trying to put an end to that nonsense.\n\nWe successfully fix the town make peace between the cops and adventurers annnnnd the schools attacked by another countries army in airships disguised as pirates, again. Only this time the head misstress was blown up\u2026..who is a multi timeline hopping chronomancer\u2026no we never saw her again because the campaign then became airship hopping to places to deal with political espionage of essentially 1 country trying to \u201cjustify retaliation\u201d agains people by insinuating they were attacked. Meanwhile it was their own troops impersonating the would be offenders.\n\nContinued.",

So yeah I said f this said remove my character entierly because I didn\u2019t want him using my guy (he did this to me when he was a player in my game but I also didn\u2019t want him doing what he was constantly doing to the npcs which was trying to make them suffer at any and every chance he got). Game fell apart after that because 2 other players left for similar reasoning of feeling like they were getting constantly sidelined and just forced to watch things happen and not be allowed to do anything.\n\nOh did I forget to mention that the way \u201cdeath\u201d worked in this world wasn\u2019t a \u201coh you just get resurrected\u201d no no you had to schedule a side session to rp a Dante\u2019s inferno thing. Ie you had to roleplay going through a whole escape your memories to comeback to life thing. There was also regular side story sessions for some characters where it was offered to show up and join\u2026.which we found out after the fact they contained main session knowledge. \n\nIe \u201cOh does anyone want to do a session around this character? They are exploring an abandoned arcade and trailing someone!\u201d Was this mentioned to any of us or did he sneak out on his own? \u201cHe snuck out\u2026why?\u201d So how would any of our characters know where he is or what he\u2019s doing? He doesn\u2019t tell anyone this stuff and him leaving to do something and coming back is a common occurrence plus you want to do this session like on a day most of us wanted to do other things so yeah. \u201cOh\u2026ok\u201d cue a 5 hour session happening unbeknownst to 3/4 of the party and that player gets bonuses and campaign knowledge he doesn\u2019t share\u2026. So when he acts upon it he looks crazy, once we find out after like 6 of these side sessions happening that\u2019s how he\u2019s giving out loot\u2026 we all have to do at least 2 to catch up, because any loot we find in the main sessions are either cursed or we \u201caccidentally destroyed them\u201d when doing the task he set in place.\n\nAll sessions were done online and through a PAID TO USE software called talespire.",

The party was investigating one such mage research outpost, and one of the numerologists had gone missing- and so the party had to sort of do a detective sequence and interview all the possible witnesses, and form a picture of what the numerologist was doing. \n\nThey killed it there.\n\nAnd I should add, my party was *all* artists. It was amazing, the role playing was great, and because all the mages were super colorful, fun NPCs, they got portraits. \n\nAnd then the actual dungeon sequence started, and... It was a prime number puzzle. This group of artists all hated math, and... It did not go well. The managed to slog their way through, but could not figure out the puzzle, and it was just painful. One of them had been a CS major for a little bit, was hoping he'd figure it out but he got really tired (it was late) and kinda checked out.\n\nBut at least the drawings were fun.",

Not even remove; we wouldn't mind, as fights were hard.\nBut when his GMPC was/had the Maguffin for every puzzle we encountered (only one who knew the language the riddle was in, had a spell that worked to let us cross hazards, used his race trait to get someone out of a trap we could have gone through ourselves), we had to ask him to tone it down.\nInstead, he got pissed off and removed them completely from the game because \"that's not how I wrote the character; he's either there as-is or not there at all.\"\n\nAnd every NPC we interact with is pseudo-to-seriously hostile to the party.\nWe have a group of 3 NPC's who are CONSTANTLY mocking one of the PC's for having dropped out of university.\n\nIt. It's a mess.\nAnd I knew this would be long; if anyone is interested in some of the system changes, lmk? I'm still waking up over here. XD",

The machinist, for example, just hands out inspiration targeting weapons and armor instead of characters, IE it's a worse bard.\n\nThe book is still great for setting, monsters, and systems to run a campaign in the Warmahordes universe, but it is sad that almost all the player content is useless.",
