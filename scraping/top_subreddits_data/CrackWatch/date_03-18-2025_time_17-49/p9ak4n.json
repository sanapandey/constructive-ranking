People who pirate games usually don't have money or don't want to spend money on them, because there are more important things if you are an adult especially. And they will patiently wait for protection to remove, so companies does nothing in their advantage against that group of people.\n\nThe real problem with denuvo is that it cause trouble for legit game owners. Yeah, it actually does affect game performance, because it's not implemented properly. And that's a fact. Good and quality game will always make a profit for companies, and be praised by buyers. \n\nBut, if you're selling copy-paste games or mediocre ones, of course you won't be confident in your number of sold copies so you need protection implemented.\n\nThe whole point is that denuvo harms even copies of legit owners, so denuvo in this shape and poorly implemented condition is just a tool for companies to improve their bank accounts, nothing else. Who cares about consumers anymore pff..",

Some example ? \"EMPRESS\" was the official cracker of Codex for the Denuvo games,after seen all the effort that Denuvo ask ended left Codex and claimed 500$ back to crack, CPY in their last  Denuvo game cracked after 3/4 patch say in the NFO \"**This is not fun anymore**\" and disappeared. Now does we like this situation ? probably Not, but because is hard and no one like to work for free now we are back to 1970 to 2000/10 where you have to pay for get your copy, Cheers!",

Basically everyone thought the game was kinda mid.  \n\n\nIt seems to me that the main problem everyone had is that the dungeon design was god awful. Just a repetition of the same bland corridors over and over and OVER, with some people suggesting the best way to experience the game is have a video on the 2nd monitor while going through the dungeons which y'know, is not ideal.  \nSecondly they changed the combat system from the usual \"press turn\" system which is in a lot of MegaTen games and is known for being tough and challenging but fair, to the \"sabbat\" system which some people liked and some not so much.   \n\n\nWhile I haven't spoiled myself on the story because I want to play through it myself, apparently lots of people thought it wasn't very good. Sorry I can't really say anything else other than \"they said it's bad\" but I really don't wanna spoil myself.  \n\n\nAmong some other more minor things, the game launched with a weird bug that made the MC's movement really weird. She would take a second or two to stop after letting go of the stick which for a couple days people didn't know was related to the FPS.   \nAnother weird thing is that the loading screens were way longer than they needed to be and players realized it was because they kept the loading screen for a full 15 seconds or something stupid like that to let players read the tips and combined with the dungeons which were a pain to go through and had loading screens all the time made it quite frustrating.  \nAlso the MC moved slow as fuck. Again, made it even more of a pain.  \n\n\nSorry for going full game reviewer on ya.",

The writer also said something about weird bugs which he attributed to denuvo, not sure if it is. But that's the story.   \n\n\nPS: Would be interesting to see a comparison to console versions, see if the same bugs are present.",

The main issue is the big fat D which is known without a shadow of doubt and the MANY receipts to back it up that it does affect performance. The other reason is the fact that unlike consoles that only have one hardware configuration, PC's have THOUSANDS of different types of hardware builds and player testing just cannot find the issues until release.\nEven \"top shelf/High tier\" builds have an unlimited build options and issues wont be found until they are.\n\nThis is the downside to PC gaming and why per-ordering shouldn't even be thought about.\nHell, I wait until a month after the first release because of this and so I can gauge reviews.\n\nAlso, I play guitar.\nThat is my one Rivers Edge quote of the month.

Right now u can't even matchmake properly in WD Legion cuz there isnt enough players. In fact there is more players on Watch Dogs 2 than WD Legion.  \n\n\nWhy is it shit and worst game? Because i finished the story in like 18 hours? It's very rushed and to do all the side stuff it's like 3 hours soo u get a 21 hour game for 60\u20ac  \n\n\nFuck Ubisoft.",

I finished Legion with the same thought, and the last three Assassins Creed games also had incredible world design / level design.\n\nBut they are very weak at other elements that can break immersion, like the AI for the NPCs and pedestrians etc. I think they react so unnatural to what you do around them, and even if the world they design is beautiful it can be a bit starved of content. They seem to follow the rule of \"if it's fun, we'll keep it in the game\" and that can turn their games really arcadey at times.\n\nThey boast about the sheer size of the maps for each AC game, but I'd rather have quality over mass.\n\nOh last point. AC: Odyssey has a dlc called Atlantis that has incredible worlds. Possibly my favorite one ever, and that's just a dlc? I'm just floored at how good they are at certain things, yet at the same time so flawed in other areas but I guess every dev studio have their weak points.",

It's such a shame, AC, Far Cry, WD in theory are great franchises, they just need proper execution.\n\nAnd yeah, I couldn't believe when they said that next AC will have even bigger map than Valhalla.

Now EMPRESS is shutting down her Element community and she\u2019s gonna create a new private Telegram group with very few selected denuvo employees allowed to be members. She says she has the entire knowledge of this world, yet she doesn\u2019t know that all those henchmen around her are paid denuvo employees who are getting paid to keep her busy. They are not her friends, nor they care about her, but the ginger queen of knowledge does not seem to know this. She wanna get rid of silent lurkers like me. Then those few henchmen, all denuvo paid bastards, began to say that she is right in doing this. Jezz, how I hate those freaks! I finish here leaving a message to EMPRESS: have fun with these paid idiots pretending to be your friend. Stay away from cracking for too long, and soon you won\u2019t be able to crack even a minecraft game. When that happens, these bitches you call friends will all be gone. And you will be forgotten. Oblivion is your fate. And a message to those paid henchmen: go to hell and go f---k yourself!",

I've noticed a lot of you seem to be lacking hope or aren't happy with the state of things at the moment or haven't been for a while. It's funny to me because I remember as a kid in my early teens, over a decade ago, finding out about pirate bay and so many other sites. It felt like Christmas, please try to remember that moment you discovered all of this, the surprise we all felt. It's a miracle any of this exists in the first place and the fact that there's still anyone who works to share free digital games, movies, shows, software, etc is why I still very much appreciate CrackWatch, a place where we can come together and see how far we've come. Even though it has slowed down, who cares, look at all that has been accomplished already. In my eyes pirates have saved more money than I can count. In a world where we hear all the time nothing is free, we can all escape to the high seas and break away from the matrix and enjoy this gift, so appreciate it. And one could say \"bUt iM nEw tO tHe ScEnE\" To you I say most of the old torrents are still around, for example fitgirls repack site has more games on it than I can possible go thru. With other sites being the same, go explore while you wait on a game that your so upset hasn't been cracked yet because \"they are being lazy money grabbers\". That's all for now my one and only post on here lol. Don't try to look at my history as it doesn't exist ;) Thanks to everyone who puts their time toward helping all pirates and to those who still remain grateful Love you all have a good life!\n\nTL;DR- Just be grateful because we could live in a world where NOTHING is free and the high seas never existed.",

There are 1-10$ I spent 1000's of hours on and 60$ games that I spend 5 hours on and got bored.\n\nEspecially digital games are just \"copies\", so why should you pay 60$ for it? The only reason less games are sold is because of these prices.\n\nI saw a mother pick out a game for their child in the gamestop once. All games were switch games so unless you choose an indie game you will have to pay 60$. She called her husband who is a gaming expert to make the choice for her. 60$ games are WAY too expensive to just buy casually. You always have to do research or you'll regret it and you can never return unsealed games.",

And your last point is actually a pro rather than a con. With every release trust would grow stronger so the risks involved in all of the above will keep getting smaller. The only two issues I see is that someone needs to actually organize and maintain this system and the crypto requirement. It would probably need to be set up in a way that people can donate a few bucks with a credit card and only the final $500 gets converted to crypto and sent to Empress.

September 2024. on Steam...Although denuvo is not yet confirmed on the Steam page the previous NBA game from 2K still has denuvo,so that alone is proof enough.\n\n3. Final Fantasy XVI is releasing 17. September 2024. on Steam and denuvo confirmed on the Steam page.\n\n4. EA Sports FC 25 is releasing 27. September 2024. on Steam and denuvo confirmed on the Steam page.\n\n5. Dragon Age - The Veilguard is releasing 31. October 2024. on Steam...Denuvo is not yet confirmed on the Steam page,but its EA,so no surprise there.\n\n6. Slitterhead is releasing 8. November 2024. on Steam and denuvo confirmed on the Steam page.\n\n7. FANTASIAN Neo Dimension is releasing for now Q4 2024 on Steam and denuvo confirmed on the Steam page since its Square Enix.\n\n8. Two Point Museum from Sega is listed for now TBA on Steam but denuvo already confirmed on the Steam page so it can go to the upcoming denuvo games part of the list.\n\n9. Indiana Jones & The Great Circle is releasing 9. December 2024. on Steam...Denuvo still not yet confirmed.\n\n10. Dying Light - The Beast announced as coming soon & Steam page is up...No denuvo confirmation for now, but is possible since Dying Light 2 had it.\n\n11. Borderlands 4 revealed as TBA 2025 & Steam page is up...No denuvo for now,but expected since Tiny Tinas Wonderlands & Borderlands 3 had it.\n\n12. Mafia - The Old Country revealed as TBA 2025 & Steam page is up...No denuvo for now,but its 2K & Mafia Remastered had it...(One of CPY-s last cracks...Those were the times)\n\n13. Sniper Elite Resistance revealed as TBA 2025...No Steam page as i am writing this...But its Rebellion so denuvo is guaranted since Sniper Elite 5 is still uncracked because of denuvo & they never remove it.",

I understand that the problem is not in knowledge. Someone with a little knowledge could become ambitious and pursue this job after gaining knowledge of voksi e mkdev. The problem was that the pirate lost her ambition and went after the money like an empress. If I say I'll pay 500 dollars to crack a Denovo game, I'm guessing there will be 5 more people along with Empress. In my opinion, piracy needs to be an industry in order to be able to produce cracks. MONEY OPENS EVERY DOOR. Nothing has ever saddened me as much as the pirate's death. It gave me the consolation that there would always be an opposing view.

What: Rename current VR games and special accessories list to \"secondary\" list and merge it with UWP list, also move Battlenet, \"F2P games that use denuvo\" and \"online only games that use denuvo\" there.

Hopefully they don't though because the latest switch titles are already pushing the hardware limits of the switch. Pokemon scarlet/violet struggles to get more than 20 frames, especially during battles with all the particle effects etc. Adding DRM when games are already struggling to run smoothly on V1 switches is just straight up evil.",

Sniper Elite 5: A good game with all content released and the last big update with the complete edition just last week\n4. Lost Judgment: A great sequel to the first game that was cracked recently with a TON of content and a great story dlc with all patches being released\n5. Persona 5 Royal: One of the best games of all time, all patches have also been released\n6. Sonic Frontiers: A good sonic game with the last update arriving later this year that will bring a free story dlc\n7. The Callisto Protocol: A stuttery mess when it released but with the latest update and all dlc released it's a good game\n8. Hi-Fi RUSH: A great surprise from tango devs this year with quite a few content and update released so far, i wouldn't be surprised if the last update was the last one but it's a great game that deserves to be preserved\n9. Like a Dragon: Ishin!: One of the most best games rgg has ever made that was stuck in japan for 9 years. It's been remade with UE4 and all patches have been released\n10. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: A very heavy game that was a buggy launch but it's gotten better, it's gonna receive more updates probably to optimize it more but it's better than launch and it's a great story sequel to the first game",

I still say we arrange a way for all of us to pool together small increments (even if it's just $1) to pay the $500. The arbitrary $500 doesn't look to be a bluff and haggling looks out of the question. A $60 AAA title for only $1 per person (and ultimately free for those that don't donate) doesn't seem so bad. I don't think we'll win with being principled, sadly - as she alone keeps the gate. Is this conceding? No, not really. Someone may say \"give her an inch and she'll take a mile\". It's possible, but she does seem to be a relatively sincere person with at least the capacity to sacrifice. I don't think her demands will get any taller, but certainly can't say this for sure.",

There's also the matter of whoever sets up the crowd sourcing could walk away with the money.\n\nOr perhaps Empress stipulates one person only, no exceptions.

The OG is so good to the point that some reviewers publications (I forgot which one) said that they can't tell the difference between the OG and the remake at a quick glance. \n\nAnd about your point \"You're so blinded by your EA hate that you can't comprehend that they did something incredible\" well I think that's a little misfire there. It's true that we all hate EA (who doesn't?! lol), but that's not why the remake hasn't been cracked. They cannot pick and choose what the D cracker cracks, and even if they care about it getting cracked or not, they can do absolutely nothing about it.

AAA games are getting worst and worst anyway , Indie games are so much better. For me the use  of  denuvo on AAA is mostly there to hide the mediocrity of AAA games titles now days. It is a reality the only AAA games wich do not use denuvo are the best ones because the devellopers do need to hide anything .  The old days with great games is over since long time , devellopers do not have any more ideas , they can only do remake , sequel , prequel  and they do it  worst , because devellopers are only  making games for money , they do not care anymore to make a good product full of content  and do not care of  the pleasure of the players , all they want it is  the money of  idiots who still by their crap as well as the money they will use with the tons of dlcs  they will release.\n\nBut since the  world is full of  idiots to support them why will they stop making crap games and use crappy    DRM and restrictions . \n\nWhen i buy a game  , i do have the right to do whatever i want with my  game , and not to play as the devellopers want.

We don't just trust in her; she can't crack every game she works on solo; she is a human, not a robot; she lost many very good games and will never crack them; we are in 2023; nowdays, gaming is gone but not forever; we still have some bullets in stock; in old times, cracks were the king; nowdays they are not. ther are probably hundreds of crazy games that still in queue waiting to be cracked like Dead Space Remake and more over the list that i cant say much, that why we need ower army to joine and crack denuvo with hight end technologie using powerfull systems that cracks auto numbers if someone is talented somehow can make something that crack under 5days, a game that would be a giant step for gaming pirates like us, we trust on us, only us matters, i hop everyone understand my post, it isnt a critique for EMPRESS , dude i like her a lot, i'am probably one of his biggest fan right here, but all i want to spread is the truth, we need more people like her, and we dont have to beg for a cracks, we need a strong group like CODEX or other old groups that are gone forever. I've got to say, if we keep going like this, we are DEAD. and by dead, I mean at all.",

If you make that path of pain from HK as 80% of your game, which is Aeterna Noctis, then you surely need tight controls if you don't want to lose your audience out of anger. Or just downright remove those sections, in this update they did that, you can lower the difficulty and the Meatboy platforms are scraped out (and you can change that at any moment).

In addition, this technology is updated, I believe that it is not the same version of Denuvo from May 2022 as one from November 2023; let me explain. Despite that, it is as you think, in my opinion, I do not understand how a group of hackers give it the name that you like the most, do not join forces to gradually release games.

I'd rather people donate even just half a dollar on something worthwhile instead of stuff like reddit awards that are literally meaningless. \n\nYou can very easily install extensions and apps to bypass reddit's obnoxious ads, anyway. uBlock Origin (which should be installed by everyone using the internet anyway) and Reddit Enchancement Suite (RES) for browsers, and apps like Slide, etc for mobile.",

Something that would incentivize dozens of talented crackers(not talking about activation scammers). Even a few cents(e.g. mined crypto which is safer) multiplied by tens of thousands of interested gamers is a lot of money.\n\nThe prevailing notion is \"Piracy is meant to be 100% free. Otherwise I would have bought the original\". This is the biggest fallacy ever. The fallacy which led us here. Firstly, the authentic copy costs multiple times more. Secondly, piracy has NEVER been actually free. Let me explain.\n\nIn the \"Scene\" you must be assigned some role and make some contribution in order to gain access to private FTP servers and their \"free\" stuff. Of course, through leaks, we could PURCHASE warez from shady computer stores, which kept piracy under control and also protected somehow \"Scene\" members from extreme exposure. Until the advent of the internet. This is when all started coming apart. Why risk participating in cracking/distributing, why spend countless hours patching triggers when you can have it all cost/risk-free from the comfort of your couch, as a p2p leecher?\n\nThis is what must be fixed. Give back the lost incentive. The missing reward for the risk taken(remember what happened to SPARKS). Sense of achievement, e-penis etc. proved not sufficient(e.g. CPY). Else the list of uncracked games will keep growing.",

The cracking scene has and will always run on trust and reputation (which often leads to donations), which is what most crackers want.\n\nPersonally I believe that if crackers want to put a price tag on their work, they're entitled to it, just as \"pirates\" are entitled not to pay it. The reason why most crackers don't is the aforementioned reputation. With so many people doing this for free, those who charge for it instead of asking for donations look bad, that's just how the free market works, the better service always wins.\n\nI'm not saying they shouldn't get that incentive, just that pirates themselves have no incentive to give it to them, that's just the reality of things. Personally I have my hopes set on \"RUNE\" who at the very least has shown some results so far, and might become reputable enough with Denuvo to warrant donating to them. But that also depends on them not turning into caricatures of themselves like EMPRESS did. Like I said, this is and has always been a community that runs on reputation.",

Apart from Delusional(currently RUNE), who, let's be honest, can only tackle the older versions and at a rather slow pace, everybody has abandoned us.\n\nDo you remember Baldman, DeltaT, MKdev, CPY, Steampunks, Voksi? All of them proved their skills time and again, at least on the earlier versions, where still lies the majority of uncracked titles. Heck, even Maurice Heumann, the DRM developer who managed to crack Hogwarts in 6 months, starting from scratch. There definitely are dozens of capable reverse engineers worldwide. Yet either lack of interest(CPY), either lack of support(Baldman) quickly drove them out or detered them altogether. It's not a matter of competence.\n\nFrom my perspective, as i have told before, the only solution is game-specific crypto wallets. A \"bucket\" for donations for a specific game. It solves many problems at once. Each donation automatically specifies the game of interest. One individual paying Empress 500$ for a 60$ game is insane. Otoh, thousands of gamers donating pennies which total 500$, without the risk of someone stealing the pot, is leaps and bounds better. \n\nI wish someone with close ties to Empress could tranfer him my proposal. It's the only way to distract him from his other cash-grabbing schemes and get him back to work.",

Eventually all win. The cracker, the ones who got the 60$ game for pennies and the die-hard free-riders.\n\nIn case you dread the probability that the vast majority of pirates fall into the categories of the second paragraph, nothing terrible happens.

Already though, these communities just pop up, who are full of people who seem like they've been together for decades, and they got like traditions and stuff lol. It's one of my favorite games and hasn't left my hard drive since it came out. I just find that part amusing. :D Dunno if you've played it lately but they've been adding in weapons from Dying Light 2 to show some of the concepts and designs! \n\nAw shit, Plague Tale was free on the Epic Store in August and I missed it! It's less than 9 bucks on FANATICAL RN, pretty tempted. Among the Sleep is the free Epic game this week FYI. I got in the habit to login and get them every week lol. \n\nAnother tangent, but the add-on Augmented Steam is the best shit ever. It shows you historically low prices and where they were sold as well as current lowest on whatever storefront they're at. \n\nI realize this is Crackwatch but it sure is nice when legit games just can automatically stay up to date and shit. \ud83d\ude01",

In terms of connection and feedback with their fans, best studio out there.\n\nI tend to claim free games on Epic even tho I probably would never finish them. I'm kinda get used to that, haha. Guess they would give away A Plague Tale for free again before sequel comes out in the next year.\n\nYeah, but some games really deserves to be bought. If we want to support some smaller developer, like creators of Hades, or mentioned A Plague Tale (I think Microsoft bought Asobo which made that game). For example, I love Ubisoft games, but all of them are on the same concept, and hell not worth the full price.

(Denuvo confirmed on the Steam page but no wonder since its 2K)\n\n2. Mandragora - Whispers of the Witch Tree is releasing 17. April 2025. with denuvo confirmed on the Steam page. (Looks like it that Knights Peak is going to be a new publisher who uses denuvo in their games, first one was Nikoderiko)\n\n3. Killing Floor 3 is delayed indefinitely to an unknown date because of negative feedback from players from the beta so we can return TBA to the date. (Still no news about denuvo in the game)\n\n4. Zombie Army VR by Rebellion is releasing TBA. (Denuvo already confirmed on the Steam page but its Rebellion so no surprise there)\n\n5. OddBallers by Ubisoft released 15. August 2024. with denuvo confirmed on the Steam page. (Somehow we miss that but its an multiplayer only game as far as i can tell so it can go to the online only uncracked denuvo games list)",

I also think Voski was caught and made a deal of some sort.\n\nThe reason why piracy went down the drain, was because the old school ideology ended, now they make money and no longer want to be known or do competition. That's the reason why the \"Scene\" retired. CODEX, CPY, PLAZA... there is no competition now, most cracks are created using old emulators, like Goldberg.\n\nAnd Empress is the \"decoy\", someone working for DNV, that from time to time, makes a few bucks out of versions that no longer matter.\n\nDoesn't make any sense that people only pay to crack outdated crap. I mean If I was to pay such amount of money I would ask for a game that was just released, not a game that is out for more then 200 days+.\n\nAlso this works to keep away everyone else from trying. I know that \"her character\", is of someone that is nuts, egocentric that looks like some egocentric psycho, but that is all that it is. A character to prevent the SCENE from rising again.\n\nThe excuse is that it takes \"too much time\", really? I mean, might take a few weeks even a few months, but if the intention is other then money, they can still do it for the challenge. It takes longer but they still can... but no one is doing it. Right now cracking DNV is the greatest achievement, even better then winning a \"release race\", right now there is no competition.\n\nAlso Empress, said \"she\" does it to fight the system, because of something she hates. Funny ... she only does it when \"she\" is paid. Not because \"she is fighting anything\".  \n\n\nVoksi once explained how he located the triggers on a video, I'm sure there are people capable of doing the exact same thing, but now one does. And this already started when certain games didn't get cracked for long time, when someone was saying the scene was being paid for it. Right now I don't doubt that. Any wh\\*re does what is told for money. And that what the scene became. The old school values are gone.\n\nEverything in \"Empress whining\" is fake has \"she is\". Most likely it's someone or a team that actually works with DNV and releases outdated sht, to keep the BS going on and to make a few bucks more, like some devs do with cheats for their own online games.",

Maybe if I had a bunch of disposable money I'd dump it on Empress, but I don't.\nThe sort of rich people that could throw 500 USD here and there are probably not going to be into piracy.\n\nPlus the person taking the money has to be trusted to pay Empress and not leave with 500 USD. A lot of money for one guy quickly getting it. And then it could happen with the next guy and so on. Maybe police may find out you've given to the pot too? I don't know how this stuff works, how safe it is.\nI know I trust myself to not run with the money if 100 people gave me 5 USD, but they would have to trust me and I would have to be bothered to make the whole bitcoin thing work. It could be easy, but it still leaves the first part. And the third part is security, could this operation lead to getting arrested? That's tedious and having people like the police look through my stuff isn't something I want.\n\nUnless you mean everyone that wants to get to 500 USD total, would all give their partial amount in bitcoin to her..That's a lot of people that may have to get into bitcoin and set that all up, isn't it? Again, I don't know bitcoin stuff. And then these people that are adding to the total, would have to do that over buying the game for themselves. If they buy into the pirate copy, they won't get any updates to it and it could be an older version that has unknown but terrible issues at the time. They probably won't have access to the online components and can't play with friends. To the individual that just wants everything that comes with buying a licensed copy, they wouldn't go for the pirate copy option.\n\nSomeone said 500 USD is a lot, but it's only 10 people's worth of buying 50 USD games, AAA games without discounts are around 40-60 USD. AAA cracks are no doubt used by more than 10 people when they come out. It's just a lot for one person, but not many. It could be a lot more in poorer regions, but not say the U.S. and there are probably more than 10 of them over there that would play any given AAA crack.\n\nBuying a license on Steam or whatever isn't ensuring preservation. If I had thousands of USD lying around and bothered to get into bitcoin exchanging, I'd probably do it. Then again, in 5 years maybe there's a Denuvo leak that makes all of their versions up to that point useless. I mainly do MP games I already have, so I'm myself not in any rush to get any cracks going. \n\nMaybe the thousands of USD could be used to somehow make that leak a reality instead of paying for individual games from Empress.",

Do like me,  ignore all those crap games and those crappy devellopers using this cancer and  support the great indie company which are doing so better games then those stupid AAA titles wich only have the name  of a franchise or the name of  a  big devellopers . All the AAA games are just  pure bullshit games now , they are only made for money by using the name of  popular franchise wich were excellent in the past, but wich fall down to mediocre to have been used again and again , the result:  always the same crap again and again , no more surprise and often less better then the previous one .",
