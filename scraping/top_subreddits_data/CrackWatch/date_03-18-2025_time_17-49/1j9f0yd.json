Games get cracked by completely [ANONYMOUS SCENE GROUPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene) who don't disclose their progress or plans to the general public so **NO ONE** knows **WHEN** and **IF** a certain game will be cracked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What are all these NFO thingies? Where do I download it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A:** NFOs are text files included with game releases that contain information about the releases. r/CrackWatch only informs which games have been cracked. To download look for the releases on CS.RIN or torrent websites. Useful websites can be found in [The Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/v60rnq/crack_watch_beginners_guide_to_crack_watch/) or  [Pirated Games Mega Thread](https://rentry.org/pgames-mega-thread) .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** WTF is Denuvo?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A:** Denuvo is a Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology used to protect games from being cracked. Games that have Denuvo are harder to crack and usually take much longer. See [Pinned Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/p9ak4n/crack_watch_games/) for a list of Denuvo games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** An update is out, but it includes the base game as well! Can I only download the update without redownloading the entire game?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A:** Yes. CS.RIN is your friend.",

If its true what I heard that denuvo cost around 50000$ per month, that cost capcom 1000 full price sales, more than 3rd of monthly sales.

Through a certain time, Denuvo will require re-activation, and then the original owner will have to go online to reactivate it. This is usually done through those desktop-sharing programs. Keep in mind you have to constantly play in offline mode, because Denuvo token can be activated on 5 machines in 24 hours. It's not as good as getting a cracked game, because it depends if someone is willing to family share and give you reactivation for free or charges 2-5$ for you to get reactivated.\n\nDenuvo games can be cracked, but they require skill and effort, it's not an easy task. Until then, your only choice is either buy the game, offline activate it, either someone does it for free or you pay for it, or hope that dev removes denuvo or leaks denuvoless exe build.",
