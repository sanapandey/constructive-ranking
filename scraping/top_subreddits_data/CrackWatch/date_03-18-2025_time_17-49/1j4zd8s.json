Automatically parses installed Steam, EA, and Ubisoft launcher games and lets you install it either through proxy (renaming steam_api(64).dll) or through hooking (winhttp, version, winmm.dll). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6srBU7ME8Lo.\n\nYou could also use SmokeAPI and the tutorials on how to use it are on the GitHub page (text guides). https://github.com/acidicoala/SmokeAPI\n\nAlso, CreamAPI does unlock the full game for Split Fiction btw so you can invite your friend through the friend pass.\n\nEDIT: Personally, I try to use CreamInstaller through proxy (version.dll) whenever possible since it doesn't overwrite any files. If Steam needs to update or if you need to verify and it updates steam_api64.dll it would remove the unlocker if you use proxy mode, but using one of the hook dlls will allow it to work throughout updates.",
