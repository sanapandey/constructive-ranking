Performance has been perfectly fine for me on 6700Xt + R7 5800x + 32GB ram so if anyone with similar rig considers playing your FPS will be around 80 with no upscaling in 1080p. \n\nInsane character creation, amazing combat, it\u2019s like ghost of Tsushima on steroids I cannot recommend this game enough if you enjoyed GoT.",

Plus the hardware isn\u2019t exactly there yet people still can\u2019t get consistent frames on a game like cyberpunk on ultra + path tracing 4k and even Ray tracing shows bad results. Games are becoming more and more demanding and with GPU prices high right now 4k won\u2019t be the average gamer for a long time unfortunately",
