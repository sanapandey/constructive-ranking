On a rig equipped with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, a game like Rise of the Ronin should run fast and smooth, but that's not the case at all. Simply roaming around the city of Yokohama averages just 64 frames per second at 4K resolution with every setting maxed out and NVIDIA's DLAA plus Frame Generation enabled. Worse, it feels quite stuttery, too. According to FLAT (Frame Latency Analytics Tool), over 14% of the frame time during the benchmark was spent under stuttering conditions.\n\n\n> This is easily the worst performance I've seen since I\u00a0set up this PC, and it's not like it comes with some sort of visual spectacle, either. Sure, Rise of the Ronin looks better than KOEI TECMO's previous titles and also has a larger explorable world, but that's not saying much. Even with DLAA turned on, shimmering and aliasing are still noticeable, an issue that I spotted in Nioh and Wo Long, too. Moreover, several assets are evidently in very low resolution despite the game taking up 151.6 GB of your drive's space after the installation.\n\nAnd that's with a AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 according to WCCFTech review",

Also, a reminder that this franchise is about a machine that lets people physically relieve their ancestors memories in order to find artifacts that give people superpowers made by an ancient advanced civilization.\n\nAnyone who thinks a flagship Assassin's Creed title set in the most requested setting of the past 15 years will flop because the protagonist is black is seriously delusional, out of touch or in denial. Probably the same people who thought Hogwarts Legacy would flop because of JK Rowlins's Twitter rants.",

If you watch the gameplay the combat system is same as ever, unimprovised, and feels a bit flat here in 2025. Ubisoft has a bad habit of making cookie cutter games every year with the cool appeal being the historical accuracy or so they tend to advertise (falsely).\n\nWhen you compare the original assassin's creed games for their time, to these in our time, they fall flat on their face. I just feel like the original idea behind the series gets more and more deviated from and its sad to see such a great series flop. And for the record there was nothing wrong with Hogwarts Legacy, only the mentally ill went after the game for rowlins tweets.",

Thus emphasizing bonuses to reward swapping and playing around with all the toys, though its not mandatory.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is your simple open world fare.",
