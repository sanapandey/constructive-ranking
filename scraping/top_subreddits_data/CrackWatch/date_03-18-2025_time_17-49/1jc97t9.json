Games get cracked by completely ANONYMOUS SCENE GROUPS who don't disclose their progress or plans to the general public so NO ONE knows WHEN and IF a certain game will be cracked.\n\nQ: What are all these NFO thingies? Where do I download?\n\nA: NFOs are text files included with game releases which contain information about the releases. r/CrackWatch only informs which games have been cracked. To download look for the releases on CS.RIN.RU's forum or torrent websites. Useful websites can be found in The Beginners Guide or r/PiratedGames's Mega Thread.\n\nQ: WTF is Denuvo?\n\nA: Denuvo is a Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology used to protect games from being cracked. Games that have Denuvo are harder to crack and usually take much longer. See Pinned Post for a list of Denuvo games.\n\nQ: An update is out, but it includes the base game as well! Can I only download the update without redownloading the entire game?\n\nA: Yes. CS.RIN.RU is your friend.",
