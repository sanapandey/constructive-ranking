    "selftext": "But honestly any argument I see about how a games rates are better then the other because one side is .6% and the other is .8% is honestly dumb.\n\nThe rates are both so abysmal and so bad that you're basically pulling to pity every time guaranteed, and the pity is a necessity because without it you're basically going to have to pull 125 times satisticly to get the character on .8%, and 175 times for the .6%. \n\nWhy argue over peanuts when you have Games giving you rates from 1.5% up to 4%.\n\nIt's my biggest grype with games like this, if you're not even going to guarantee the character at first pity but place it at 50/50 then why not just raise the base rate to 1 or 1.5%, the game will still be profitable while making it more enjoyable for the player base.\n\nYet you see people brag like it's better somehow because that sides pulls this much to pity vs this side pulls that much to pity.\n\nIf you lose the 50/50 it's still way to much to pull the darn character either way. And you WILL lose it 5 times out of 10.\n\n",

However, the rate is hitting that 5% is pretty much as frequent as... a game with like 2% rate that gives out pulls like candy. You get less pulls but it's undeniably much easier to pull the units you want, and due to less variance, less instance of just randomly missing a character you desperately want.\n\nPAD also used to have 5%ish rates and also gave away pulls like candy, maybe even more outrageously than any other gacha with even worse rates. When you've played PAD during this period, it was pretty much impossible to enjoy any other gacha system cuz they all felt stingy as fuck. PAD soon kinda defaulted to <1% max rarity characters who ran the meta and also cut back on the gacha, and it felt a bit more in line with a Mihoyo game.",
