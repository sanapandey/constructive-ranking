For some fucked ip reason this is rare in other games, and some games make stamina items have a time limit(cough arknights). Pure prisms are honest to god an amazing addition, and the addition of higher reward dungeons helps a lot with easily leveling characters. Also Command Seals being regened after one day instead of three is a massive improvement.\n\nAnd they added a back button. Who remembers when they didn\u2019t have a back button Roflmao.

Soft pity at 50 pulls, carries over in normal banners. There aren't that many limiteds but getting old ones is a pain(Basically spark at 200-300 pulls or bust). Limited banners are also awful, rateup is 70% but there are 2 new high rarity units in them, one limited, one not. No weapons or gear in gacha, all you pull for is characters, dupes not needed.\n\n\nGenerosity: There's plenty of old events that have become permanent, so new players can get quite a bit of premium currency(It will take a while though...). Besides that, and the game giving ~20 free pulls in limited and collab banners, its not that generous.\n\n\nStory: lots of worldbuilding. Also unlimited yapping that goes nowhere. You'll learn to fear Kaltsit(Thankfully she got better over time).\n\n\nArt: little fanservice, lots of cool outfits.",

That squash and stretch early 2000s aesthetic is a delight to see every time and makes the game feel alive in a way other Gachas simply don't do. 11/10 perfect marks. The story is also solid, the characters have all been amazing, quirky, and interesting with strong designs. The story has been great thus far, but some have expressed pacing issues given how they have trimmed down the \"yapping\" that the other Hoyo games get criticized for. Probably sure there's a middle ground somewhere here.\n\nQoL: Pretty strong I wanna say. The devs have really been on the ball as of late and each patch feels stronger than the last.\n\nSummoning: Pretty standard Hoyo fair, no real notes to say here. I appreciate the counter at the bottom saying how close to pity. Kinda wish they'd bring back the full patch banners they did in 1.4 but that's nitpicking. \n\nGenerosity: Iirc it's about 100-130~ pulls a patch. Seems fair enough to me, not sure what other people's standards are though.\n\nOverall, really happy with ZZZ so far.",

Turn based combat that\u2019s just slightly simplified P5 combat with highlights and on demand navi skills, dungeon crawling and daily life sim.\n\n*Story:* Great for a gacha story, its written/directed by one of the actual PStudio writers (Yusuke Nitta) and it shows.\n\n*Quality of Life:* Auto mode, skip/fastforward/skim cutscenes, ability to burn up to 5x stamina for 5x rewards after completing a grind node. Post release they added 100% gacha system for characters, the ability to skip the repetitive parts of daily life sim activities, focus on multiple confidants to level up, and in Sea of Souls (MoC equivalent I guess) you can skip the easy rounds if you\u2019re at a certain ranking or higher (and its pretty easy to sustain). Also the ability to exchange lower rarity mats for ascending/leveling/skilling for higher rarity ones and vice versa super quick.\n\n*Stamina:* 240 max, takes like a day to fully charge\n\nAnd daily life has its own system that gives you 5 points daily and you can store up to 20\n\n*Summoning:*\n\n1500 currency per multi for characters, always guaranteed a 4 star character per multi\n\n1000 currency per multi for weapons\n\n*Gacha:*\n\nCharacters have two different systems you can pick from\n\nOld: 50/50 at 80 pulls, soft pity at 70 pulls. \n\nNew: 100% at 110 pulls, soft pity at 80 pulls. Random standard character ticket every 165 pulls.\n\nWeapons only have one system. 50/50 at 70 pulls, soft pity at 60 pulls. You pick three standard banner weapons to lose your 50/50 to.\n\n*Generosity:* Excellent. You can pull the majority of limited characters and their weapons as a FTP and they do a pretty good job of rerunning characters \n\n**Infinity Nikki**\n\n*Gameplay:* Mario meets BotW meets Barbie. Yes.\n\n*Story:* Pretty whatever, I don\u2019t play it for the story I can tell you that much.\n\n*Quality of Life:* Skip feature for burning stamina. Interactive Map that syncs with your account progress. Autopicker for styling challenges. \n\n*Stamina:* 360 max, takes like 30 or something hours to completely refresh.\n\n*Summoning:* 120 per pull, 1200 for a multi.\n\n*Gacha:*\n\nFive star banners: 1 five star piece every 20 pulls guaranteed, 1 four star piece every 10 pulls guaranteed. Need to pull 9-10 pieces to complete each outfit. So max pity is roughly 100 pulls for a four star outfit and 200 pulls for a five star outfit. You can guarantee a certain five star piece in 100 pulls and have certain items with pull milestones with makeup, props, Momo outfits. At 180 pulls you get a dupe stone to unlock the first recolor for a five star outfit (for a four star outfit you need to pull the entire set again) and at 230 pulls you get the second. But if you want the final recolor you need to pull the entire five star outfit all over again. \n\nFour star banners: One four star pieces every 5 pulls and you need 8-10 pieces to complete so roughly 40-50 pulls. To unlock the only recolor you need to pull the entire outfit again. Also has some pull milestones too with some extra clothing items.\n\n*Generosity:* Hard to rate. They give out tons of free clothes and you can get a complete five star outfit roughly every other month. But getting the final recolor for a five star requires saving a ton or whaling and not really worth for FTP.",

            "body": "Punishing: Gray Raven\n\nGameplay: 3D Action game where you switch between 3 characters. You match 3 same color orbs to use skills and call in assists from your units who are off field. Teams are usually made up of an Attacker, Tank and Support of the same element. Gameplay is really flashy, but at the same time very smooth and satisfying. Characters can have a ton of different combos and gameplay depth. Some like Alpha really push what you can realistically do with inputs in a mobile game. Very predictable powercreep due to how rigid teams are. An S rank character comes out (for example, Lightning Tank), they are good for several patches, and then eventually get powercrept and out of service. There are auto daily farms, two weekly modes, two biweekly modes, and plenty of events that offer a good variety of content. Story is 2D visual novel style with 3D combat instances.\n\n\nQol: Lots of good qol. Sweeps for dailies, plenty of stamina and stamina boosters, many kinds of auto clears to make things less tedious, good team preset and gear loadout features.\n\nSummoning: PGR has a really good system. New S ranks are guaranteed at 60 pulls, weapons are 80/20 at 30 pulls, and CUBs (pets) are 20 pulls. Gacha currency income is enough that you can get every new S rank as long as you stay on top of dailies and weeklies (and somewhat with events). There are free skins which can be farmed from the dorm or from events, and some premium skins which can be pulled with Gacha currency. The first dupe of characters can be farmed from the weekly pain cage mode.\n\nGenerosity: the og DEVSLISTENED game. You get tons of Gacha currency just for playing, and don't necessarily need to be sweaty either. You have enough to get every new debut S rank. Currency income is mostly participation based, so F2P can comfortably get all the currency. There are multiple free S rank characters, and many ways to get older ones for free, including the voucher shop, selectors, and the limited guarantee which refreshes rarely.

My only gripe with it is that Jinhsi doesn't have a BiS team yet (Carlotta stole her teammates)\n\nFor summoning it's almost the same as hoyo games but with a guarenteed weapon banner which is nice, but I hate that 4 star weapons are borderline useless.\n\nMaybe it's just me being smart with pulls and saving but I got every unit I wanted.\n\nCasual: GI, Tribe Nine\n\nI honestly enjoy GI so much more when I stop treating it as a 'main' game, there's nothing to be said about it that hasn't been said by others. Natlan feels so refreshing honestly, best time I've had with the game aside from Inazuma.\n\nI don't even treat T9 as a gacha game tbh, for some reason, the fomo isn't really there. I will say that the story is so good so far. Only gripe with it is the slow combat animations which I'll probably get used to later.\n\n\nSide games: HSR, ZZZ, GFL2\n\nHSR: It's \"generous\", but with the caveat of keeping up with powercreep. Being smart about your investments (and also luck) can help you avoid that though. My sustainless break is clearing everything without any issue. Gameplay is a standard 3 button turn based game similar to E7, but with energy system and break bars. Speed stat is the biggest problem for me but I guess it can't be helped.\n\nZZZ: Even though it's a side game, it's my favorite out of all gachas. I love the fast paced combat especially parrying which feels so satisfying. So far it's pretty generous but that could change later down the line.\n\nGFL2: It honestly caught me by surprise, I didn't expect it to be that good. Story is pretty decent so far, and I'm loving the XCOMish gameplay. IMO it trumps most gacha games when it comes to the 3D Model details (For example, you can see strap gaps when using Suomi and Sabrina's bikini skins, I honestly didn't expect the straps to have their own models). I will say though that it's my favorite when it comes to skins and character designs, it's the first game I dropped money on cosmetics (Sabrina my beloved). So far it's the most generous out if all of them, and has very good QoL (skip stage after first clear.) My one gripe with it that it's tedious to level up dolls due to a spike for latter level requirement.",

            "body": "Main Games:\u00a0\n\n\nLimbus Company-\n\n\nKnown for it's vocal count fanbase, and it giving you the option to directly craft units instead of having to pull gacha every time. Also, it's really just an album collaboration between Mili and Studio EIM that happens to have a pretty good game with a solid story attached /lh.\n\n\nGacha rates are fairly standard at like 3% for 000 units, and 1.2% for EGO (Basically, swappable ults); and non-transferable pity at 200; however, you can earn shards to buy out a unit directly. There are some minor caveats, such as you have to wait a week for seasonals, and seasonals get removed from the crafting pool for one season after their debut season before being added back in, and Walpurgisnacht units you can't directly craft until the next Walpurgis after their debut; however, the game is pretty generous with pull income, and averages out at about 65-70 pulls a month, so you can pretty easily hit pity at least once without having to spend.\n\n\nGameplay is a lot of fun. Regular, non-focused encounters are pretty basic, but the animations are nice, and boss encounters can get genuinely engaging.\u00a0\n\n\nHeaven Burns Red\n\n\nMy guilty pleasure game.\n\n\nGacha is kind of terrible due to YoStar turboing out banners at light speed, and we aren't getting enough pull income to make up for the speed increase, still. The rates aren't bad, 3% with a non-transferable pity of 150; however, income is a bit on the slower side. On the bright side, we do get a lot of random SS tickets and what not, so it is pretty easy to at least get a collection going.\u00a0\n\n\nGameplay itself is kind of mixed. I do enjoy the boss battles in the higher level content where you can actually make mistakes and be severely punished for it. However, the combat system doesn't translate well for random mob encounters due to how SP works in the game, plus skills being a bit heavy on the SP, and the way normal attacks are very weak compared to skills. Unfortunately, there are a lot of normal encounters in the side scrolling dungeons bits, which are absolute dogshit and boring as all hell, and said side scrolling dungeons bits absolutely infest the main story, and grind (Though, Tear Dungeon is that bad due to the much lower encounter rate)\n\n\nI mostly just play it because I genuinely like the characters. Maeda is amazing at writing great characters, with enjoyable banter, and some surprisingly sweet and emotional moments, and while the actual plot and the world building isn't anything special, there's just enough of a hook and a bit of mystery to keep you engaged in tandem with the colorful cast of characters. It's like if RWBY (before it went to shit with Monty Oum's Death) and Angel Beats had a baby, and the aunt was Symphogear. That's pretty much HBR in a nutshell.\u00a0",

This only happens ONCE per banner and if you fail to get a 6\u2729, the soft pity will get transferred to the next banner. After the new released operator banner ends, they immediately go into normal standard pool.\n\nLimited banners have all of that, now plus with the hard pity of the limited at 300 pulls and the spark token system (1 token/pull). Old limiteds don't rerun, but will too get included in the next limited banners with a higher chances to get as the off-rate, old limiteds from now on will slowly get their token exchange in the shop lowered to 200 tokens. After the limited banners end, if you haven't exchanged the tokens, they'll get turned into certs so you can buy mats from T1-4\n\nCollab banner will have their hard-pity lowered to only 100 pulls (20 free pulls guaranteed), no token system\n\nIt sounds like shit to you who don't play the game, but trust me, for I pulled every banner and now still have about 500 rolls with 127 POs\n\nGenerosity: 5 pulls/week, 4 tickets/month from Green Certificate shop, 38 tickets in Gold Certificate ( it usually takes 2 banners to get 258 Gold Certs), bunches of freebies from events, u can farm Orun too if u r dedicated to 1-7 and base set-up (not recommended). \n\nDupe is almost non-existent, unless you want to do the\u300e7 OP 940 CCB#3\u300f clear or being an absolute simp for Eblana ripped stockings\n\nSkin can be bought with free currency you get from clearing stages, too bad HG hates money and won't sell us all the skins from Ambience Synesthesia\n\nBlue Archive:\n\nGameplay: The Kurokage raid in JP last week was a delusional attack that NEXON used to distract you from the main gameplay, the Mika Misono L2D saying 'Good morning' to you at the lobby screen\n\nQoL: Standard JP gacha game UI, NEXON fixed almost all of the bugs from the release, I think so, I'm not sure\n\nSummoning: Similar to Arknights, but no soft-pity and every banners have token system with the 3\u2729 at 200 tokens. Anniversary will double the 3\u2729 to 4%, old limiteds will have their banners rerun\n\nFrom my experience, rate-up is a lie, most of the time you will get everyone but the rate-up students. So better save up for at least guaranteed 200 pulls or as much gems as you can until the Anniversaries (I'm at 88k gems with 45 tickets rn)\n\nGenerosity: I haven't done any accounting for BA, but it's fairly similar to Arknights. Also you just need to get the student, the Eleph you get from pulling will do their thing to get students to UE50",

Square with the characters face on it that you move. Leveling up characters give them acc\u00e8s to new skills, and leveling up skil level makes the character's skills more likely to activate.\u00a0\n\nGacha:no pity,\u00a0 ot a lot of pulls. Most unit end up in standard pool but those who don't might never rerun. One free standard unit for anniversary.\n\nCharacters:lots of sexy males in this. The girls are quite fine too. Only 2d images. All character have a 3* version and at least one version of higher rarity. 3* stars have access to all the characters skin catalogue (for free) since it's alos their dialogue apparence. This include at a swimsuit version.\n\nStory:pretty good. A bit convoluted at times but very mysterious and engaging.\nEvents: classic \"do story quest and collect special material to exchange in a shop\" type stuff. Stories are quote good too.\nAll events you missed are playable without rewards.\n\nQOL(or rather, lack there of): 25% of the game isn't translated. The game has only one server for both JP and global, but quests and units arent translated in English where they release. You sometime have to wait for a year.\nAlso old game, not surprised if it EoS soon.\n\n-Crave Saga (18+)\n\nCombat:pretty fun. Turn based. 5 characters with unique weapons/skills, plus weapons you can assign to any character that all have different effect. All weapon have a limited usage per fight, which means you gotta plan good before being left with only basic attacks (and ult, but basic charges it slowly) Plus you can summon a \"Sacred\" that do lots of dmg and buff your team a lot, for 3 turns once per fight. Chibis.\n\nGacha:quite generous. Like housamo, most units end up in standard pool, while the other really rerun. Tho they do premium currency banners that allow you to pick one limited unit. Pity limited to the specific banner you pulled on.\nHard part is getting upgrade material (tho dupes give you said material for this unit only).\n\nCharacters: only males, often in skimpy outfits.\nNo skins, only alt versions.\nUpgrading characters give you access to 18+ stills.\n\nStory: basic isekai. Mostly a way to introduce more units. The world building is okay tho.\n\nEvents: alternate between \"item collection with story\" and \"big boss fights\"\nAll of those give one free 4* star.\n\nQol:they added many cool features: ability to get the event units you missed, a petting mode for the mascot character, a quizz on the mechanics and lore. But the game is quite okay as it is, it doesn't need many Qol.\n\n\nIf anyone know other good bara gachas, pls tell me.",

Most of them are alright in V0 and improve their kit with V1 or their weapon, so going further than that is for flexing or simping. But there are a few exceptions. For instance, the next version's character (Klukai) is a very solid aoe damage dealer but weak on single target damage. However, she has the potential to become the best dps in both aoe and st if she gets max dupes (V6). Her aignature weapon is completely optional btw. This is the only case I've heard of a character needing to reach max dupes in this game. Typically, everyone priorizes pulling for new characters rather than pulling for dupes or weapons.",

The core gameplay focuses on pinging 1-3 orbs (except for other characters), and doing a combo with other orbs, basic attack, or dodges to use a unique skill for each characters called \"core skills.\" These core skills are like \"bread and butter\" of that character or \"constructs\" as we call it.\n\nThe gameplay also has tons of mechanics like a parry system, counters, etc.\n\nQoL: They have auto-features for other modes like dailies, dispatches, and certain dailies and weekly level.

Event banner (basically their \"current patch\" banner) has two main forms of banners which choices depends on how much of a gambler you are.\n\nGenerosity: PRAISE KUROGAMES, THESE GUYS ARE HARDCORE. Currently they have this plan to sync with their CN server which is 2-years more advanced than global. As part of the plan, they are giving 2x/3x the usual rewards for weeklies and dailies, that also includes the serum which is the game's energy resources.",

Hope you remembered to go back if you were in another town since theres zero indication unless u noted it from the announcements. Mausoleum reset? Game doesnt tell you. Want to reverse some junk? Throws you back to the top of the list everytime because fk u i guess. The game is full of bad ui and sorting like that. I hope you like inventory management. Systems feel like they are working against you alot of the time, like oneway class scroll system , bondmate incense system etc\n\nSummoning:  \nWorse than fgo. 2k gems for 11 rolls, pity at 100. 30gems per day from daily and 200 from weekly, additional 50 weekly if u go to wizardry store online and claim. Havent rolled with gems since the start of the game and have arnd 56k, didnt play everyday. Most of it is apologems, u dont rly get shit from the story. Standard legendaries can be guaranteed from another currency u get from daily/weeklies except they havent added any new to the pool. \n\nWhy am i still playing? Its satisfying if u treat it as a single player drpg and dont play it everyday and get too serious about the game. story content and progression is fun",

            "body": "WuWa is my main. Used to be Genshin but the rng involved in every single farming system killed my drive build any more teams, and Natlan was kinda mid, so I gave WuWa a shot and loved it, and the more I played it the harder it was to go back to Genshin.\n\n**Gameplay**: Pretty fantastic. Theres interesting synergies with gearsets, intro and outro skills for team building, and some really really fucking hard bossfights that require a FromSoft level of pattern memorization to effectively dodge and counter attacks, so the game can get really sweaty if you want to pursue those challenges.\n\n**World Design**: Early 1.0 WuWa was honestly very mid. Felt like a bland post apocalyptic setting, just green and yellow hills. Didnt look bad, just very generic open world like Mondstadt. Once you get to Mt Firmament, Black Shores and Rinascita, boy does that change. The latter in particular is very Elden Ring inspired and looks gorgeous, and was a treat to fully explore.\n\n**Chara Design**: again, early WuWa wasnt that fantastic\u2026 and it didnt help that 80% of the characters had Chinese names, which gave the starter area even more of a generic Wuxia feel. Some gorgeous characters eventually did start to be revealed - Changli, Jinshi, Shorekeeper were all fantastic and great attention is given to fleshing out their characters in long quests. Rinascita has also delivered fantastic Chara design coupled with top tier VA work, and characters definitely look Different, and not just a different head pasted on the same body which is something Genshin suffered a lot from. Only minus point\u2026 lack of male characters. Fans call it Gathering Waifus for a reason.\n\n**Music**: Early 1.0 music is ok, kinda generic ambient, sorta forgettable. Rinascita started delivering far better tracks, including fully voiced songs, its improved a LOT, but Im personally hoping we eventually get big bangers on the level of PGR. \n\n**QOL**: Its is fantastic. Kuro basically looked at everything that was annoying or frustrating about Genshin and improved it. Wanna craft? You can do that anywhere. TP directly to bosses. Double spend resin on domains to get double reward without needing to craft concentrated resin first. Get any material, any day of the week. Peak exploration, you have a grapple, fly in Rinascita, you have a shooting gadget for puZles so you dont need to swap out to a shooting character\u2026 no rng on weekly boss material drops\u2026 gear loadouts, etc etc, the list goes on. Devs definitely listen to the community.\n\n**Generosity**: Quite generous. You get about 3 times as much currency to buy pulls from playing the game, as you would in Genshin. Weapon banner is 100% which is fantastic, though 4star weapons arent that great, but its satisfying to know as a f2p, if you plan your pulls you can get your bis without worrying about losing the 50-50. If you save up enough mats you get from pulls, you can even get constellations/sequences for free, just buy em, no pulls needed. Ive only been playing a few months but managed to get a 0-tier dps AND her weapon even after I lost her 50-50 without spending a dime, just playing the game. \n\n**Story**: Honestly, nothing to write home about. Not bad, just kinda servicable. There are a few great beats, arcs and moments\u2026 and the great animated dialogue scenes certainly make it very palatable, just nothing has blown me away yet like Fontaine and Forcalors did, but I trust they are building toward something epic, and Black Shores delivered some great heartstirring moments so Im willing to let Kuro cook.",

Or at least, unless you want to become a high ranker, you don't need to max dupes most units.   \nStory aside as you can clear that with pretty much anything, you can clear Fiend Hunt (end-game content) lv10 (highest level to receive the more relevant rewards, as over lv10 you just get gold, the in-game money currency) without max duped DPS. \n\nIt is however indeed strongly recommended to max dupes supports as those are universally usable everywhere.  \nSame with exclusive gear, it isn't a must have in any case except wanting to be a high ranker. For most casuals, gear banners shouldn't be touched except for their daily free pull. \n\nFor those wondering, as I see it was indicated for Guardian Tales, the rates for BD2 are 3% for 5 stars (though it's half and half for the rate up unit, so effectively 1.5% for pick up 5* unit and 1.5% for non). \n\nLastly, just wanted to clarify that although they have indeed taken a 'spicier' route, it's not like they abandoned their 'nostalgic' JPRG content. As a matter of fact, they're focusing more on main story, which is devoid of such content whatsoever and very reminiscing of old schoold JPRG indeed, in this exact moment.",

Absolutely gorgeous Western Fantasy style designs with emphasis on the 'cool' factor over sexiness due to the original devs being Western (Kabam of Marvel Contest of Champions infamy but the game has since been bought by Netmarble) and by far the best looking game that I can run on my PC thanks to being a very early UE5 bandwagoner.\n\nIt still has dramas but I'm happy ignoring them and just grinding my progress daily without having spent anything yet. Not going to talk too much about pulls and other such nonsense because at the end of the day if you like this gameplay loop that is all irrelevant.",

            "body": "Honkai Impact 3 has been my main game since 2018.\n\nGameplay:\nThe original ZZZ combat without the hand holding. If you miss the timing, well shit, start over again + wasting time OR restart the whole boss fight until you do it right to get a higher score.\n\nSince Part 2 started, how you play your teams have greatly changed. Before, you just have 1 dps, 1 or 2 supports. Now, ALL Part 2 characters are Hybrid dps and support. This means you now have complete flexibility on how to build teams. All you have to take note of is that their tags need to match to unlock their full potential. No more 1 character-centric teams.\n\nWith the addition of the Astral Ring system, we now have teams focused on, Solo DPS (you can't switch characters for a set period), focused on QTE, characters that can be used anywhere (basically characters that are slotted in when you are missing a 3rd character to fill the required tag).\n\nUnlike before where the meta is constantly changing each patch (which is also what made HI3 very notorious alongside powercreep). Because of Part 2, the meta and powercreep became more relaxed. We are already 9 patches in since Part 2 started and Sena and Thelema, the very first Part 2 characters released are still recommended in teams because of how versatile their passives are. We know they are going to last long because both are hybrids and are very good at their roles, especially Thelema. Ofc pulling the newer character will give you more of an advantage but thats normal in any gacha.\n\nAlso, mashing buttons? If you're casual, sure, go ahead. But if you intend to be competitive well tough luck, your mashing buttons technique will only get you so far. Because of recent changes the skill ceiling went higher, especially in the pvp sections of the game. If you wanna get a higher ranking, practice hard. Literally get good noob.\n\nQoL:\nA few patches ago they added skip tickets so majority of the dailies are now a few clicks away. No more traversing the menu to beat a lot of stages. Just go to the mission page, click the LITE missions, click, click, click, DONE.\n\nThey also added LITE mode to the Elysian Realm (OG SimU of HSR). It doesn't automatically clear the whole run ofc but it will skip the first half of it (7 out of 17 floors) so finishing the game mode isn't that tedious like before.\n\nThey added Voyage Log, basically events since Part 2 started are now added here so you can replay them anytime. Downside is that it's only for Part 2, CaptainVerse events and Flamechasers summer events are not here but baby steps, maybe one day.\n\nPart 2 Stigmata (essentially your Genshin Artifacts, HSR Relics, ZZZ CDs) are fully craftable. Dupes are 1:1 when salvaged. This is great because lets say I'm missing one essential piece and i have a dupe of an already existing stigmata. I just salvage that and use the mat to make it to another. No extra mats needed. In comparison, salvaging 1 relic = 10 relic remains. synthesizing 1 relic in HSR requires 100 relic remains. \n\nSummoning:\nNO FUCKING 50/50.\n\nCharacter banner? 90 pulls. Didn't get them before 90? Thats ok, you are guaranteed to get them at 90. Does it carry over? Yes.\nWeapon banner? 60 pulls. Didn't get them before 60? You'll get it at 60. Yes, will carry over.\nThose Part 2 stigmata I mentioned? They have a higher droprate. You will be literally swimming in those dupe mats that you're essentially future proof in crafting future stigmatas.\n\nSince Part 2 started, all banners has its first 10pulls 50% off + they give out 1 free stigmata selector for the featured new character.\n\nIf you get extremely unlucky, you'll spend at most 150 pulls flat. Compare that to how Part 1 gacha was where you need around 400+ pulls.\n\nGenerousity:\nLol. Lmao even.\n\nUnlike its newer siblings, HI3's single pull is 280crystals. The majority of your crystal income will come from pvp and Elysian Realm. Pvp will of course cater to the newly released character first. Same goes with ER but its still manageable even with previous Part 2 Valks. So if you want to get more income, you need to get good in pvp. You get more crystals the higher your bracket is so that means you will need to literally stop mashing buttons and learn how to properly play against whales. The fact that Part 2 changes made it easier for a lot of people to 4/4 BiS build their characters made it also harder (see craftable stigmatas). If you get lucky and reach a higher bracket, pray that that this bracket has chill people if not, you'll just see a whales going hard.\n\nAnd at the end of it all, in one week you'll more or less get around 1200+crystals. So to get a 10pull, you need to be consistent in your rankings and always beat ER in the hardest difficulty. It'll be faster if you have the monthly card + bp of course but for f2p its still very possible.\n\nEnding Points:\n\nHI3 is a great game. Its old but mihoyo is still trying to modernize the game. Heck, we have no black screens + hand on heart poses here, we have full 3d animated cutscenes with dynamic camera angles and zooms. But if you want to try and play it, be sure to fully dedicate yourself in it. You won't get anywhere if you dilly dally. Basically work hard and the game will reward you for it, be that in the story or in the gameplay. Thats why my first and foremost advice to people who are interested in HI3 is to find out first what they want: if you are only interested in the lore and animations, go to youtube. I say this because most of the people i have seen and known who jumped in just because of HSR dropped it because of the gameplay or how old it is. But if you truly want to love the game, learn the lore, understand the characters and actually play the game? Then go ahead and play HI3. Its more rewarding that way.",
