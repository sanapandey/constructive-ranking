Also the pc version if you delete the game it deletes your account permanently and starts a new one. If you don't have the phone version installed. So it's better to download the phone version and just keep that one and just link it to whatever you want that to play. That's what I learned anyway. Keep phone version forever. Link it to whatever device. Don't just download the steam version because it's a high chance you'll lose all your data.",

And again, the game has a link account option via password. Just save the password on a cloud somewhere and that's all you have to do. You've created your own problems here.",

I shouldn't have to though. I'm pretty sure there is no option to change storage when it starts downloading in game. You probably have the phone version downloaded, too. This is only if you only have the pc version. If you delete the steam version. Even if you save the username and password. It's gone. It won't save it. This is if you uninstall the game on steam, without the phone version downloaded.  I tried to link a username is password from a previous deleted version and wouldn't link. The account was gone completely.",
