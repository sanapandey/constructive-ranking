Thats the thing people like you dont take into their perspective.\n\nLets take a good comparison here cause I saw not so many people say this but there are still brainless people who are having this take.\n\nZZZ has more \"Endgame modes\" than Genshin. These Endgame modes are = combat modes. ZZZ is a fully combat mode oriented, nothing more, nothing less, correct? \n\nNow, what is exactly Genshin marketed as or their target audience?  An casual exploration aRPG game. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nNow, from what Genshin devs are doing since the beginning, wich one of these audiences you think they are focusing on? Cause to me, as someone who is not a casual, they are not targeting me, like, at all. I still enjoy the game for the things they put effort on, but its not this niche \"endgame fully combat 24/24 give me more combat challenging etc etc etc etc etc\". \n\nThis is what people like you dont understand but they are trying to push these naratives. \n\nThe game was never meant to be from the very beginning what I/YOU/OTHERS want to be. Thats the simple truth. Im not defending the fact they could add these things that a very small part of the playerbase ask for cause its not a bad thing, but they dont want to.\n\n1. Endgame modes = the average genshin player doesnt care about this, its easy to see even from sample sizez abyss floor 12. The game register milions of players, yet the sample sizez of abyss are in range of 100k+. I know more people are doing abyss and not registering their data, but 100k+ for a game that its basically trending on par with League,  wich means it has an insane audience, this is like a drop in a bucket.\n\n2.Artifact loadouts = a thing thats asked on social media by the exact same players at the point 1. Cause who is switching artifacts everyday on multiple characters? Your average 5 mins/day player who enters to do their dailies and plays few hours when patch is coming? No. The \"hardcore\" might use it but the rest of 95% of playerbase would not use it, I can bet huge ammounts of money they dont even know what loadouts are.\n\nQoL that should be in the game tho wich helps everyone, be it casual/\"hardcore\"(hardcore gacha players sounds funny to me, you aint hardcore lil pup, you just play more, go play some dark souls before you name yourself hardcore).\n\n1. non daily lockout domains.\n\n2. weekly bosses 3x per week (at least)\n\n3. ability to change materials to others materials\n\n4. some adjustments to old characters that are left behind because of their elements (idk if its a qol but would be good).\n\nAnd there are more that dont come into my mind now but these are important ones.\n\nNow, if people like you would actually step out of their echo-chambers and actually THINK and analyze from a wider point of view, you would understand what and why they are doing things like this and not adding 50 endgame modes in a casual game that 95% of players dont care.\n\nThey will add into my zzz combat modes indeed, more than in Genshin, cause thats the whole selling point of ZZZ. \n\nYou can also add wuwa here, even tho it is an open world just as genshin, they are also focusing more into combat related stuff and modes (they kinda failed in some degree but still). \n\nThink.",
