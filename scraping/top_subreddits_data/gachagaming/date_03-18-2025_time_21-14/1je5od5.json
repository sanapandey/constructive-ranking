It could be the most western looking bow and arrows, but if the whole character is not designed to accomodate that huge bow, and perhaps has some slick quiver holder, then the design falls off. It is contextual to the game for sure, this is just a stupid example, don't take it at heart !\n\nIt does not mean the game is literally unplayable, but I think you can at least appreciate why some designs make more sense than others, it is definitely not the most important thing in the world again, but something you can appreciate for extra immersion, and something that can embellish the personality of certain characters.",

But what I meant in my previous comment was that as long as the design is \"good\" then the practicality or lack thereof is not problem. \n\nA good design is subjective, of course, but I think it should have cohesion - something that a bow boothill would not have. A good design should serve its intended purpose, to be sexy, cool, ugly - as long as it is successful at doing what is intended then i would consider it well designed. And if, in doing so, the design loses some practicality or has superfluous elements in pursuit of achieving its intended function, then I think it is justifiable.\n\nI hope this can clear up my thoughts :)\n\nEdit: I suppose one could then argue that if an artist wanted to design a \"good\" knight then it shouldn't have any boob holes, skirts, etc. But I think that an artist can have multiple intensions - they could be aiming to have a knight that is also sexy.\n\n Different artists and viewers would have different priorities for these objectives, and its just that my personal priorities only state that \"as long as it looks identifiable as a knight\" it's good, then they should focus on achieving the other objectives. \n\nI could definitely see someone saying that a \"good\" knight should prioritize looking like traditional and functional - but that's just not me and not something I personally value.",
