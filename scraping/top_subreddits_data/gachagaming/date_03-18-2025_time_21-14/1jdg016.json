    "selftext": "Gacha games release characters regularly and some characters can be game-changing. \n\nTo expand on the title question. What character or characters did you obtain and use that felt like it gave a significant boost to your overall gameplay experience?\n\n It can be that the character/s made your game easier, or allowed you to hit higher point scores or expanded your strategies, or maybe satisfaction from a obtaining a waifu/husbando. \n\nFor example with Arknights\n\n* 1st major breakpoint was obtaining the fabled Silverash and Eyjafalla in Year 1. The schwing schwing and volcano deleting mobs and bosses eased a lot of early game struggles. \n* 2nd major breakpoint was obtaining Thorns, Blaze, and Surtr in Year 2. 2 solid lane holders and a boss killer. They tend to be regulars in my team compositions to this day. \n* 3rd breakpoint begrudgingly is Wisadel. Trivializes the game too much that I actively ignore using her. \n\nI got a few in mind in other games but have to double check acquisition dates. \n\n",

She's best in-slot everywhere as a support and pretty much any option that isn't her is heavy coping. She does a mix of everything: attack buffs, reload speed buffs, shields for the entire team to increase survivability, and she can also taunt and make herself invincible for 5 seconds to soak up enemy fire and completely cheese certain bosses/stages. I guess you can think of her as the Bennett of Nikke(I don't play Genshin so... I don't know if Bennett's been powercrept, just that he good or something)",

He doesn't buff damage, he doesn't give exceptionally high resource generation, he doesn't preemptively shield (at e0), but he discards all that power budget to be the pinnacle unit at one thing: healing. All he does is heal, for basically free (most of the time) and he is so good at it that his release basically corrupted the future design of every sustain unit forever as his healing mechanics not only healed for far more than was necessary to keep a team alive, he also further scales with attack frequency and allied target count without expending extra resources. Of any unit in HSR, he is the one who has taken his role to the absolute pinnacle while just autoattacking and hitting his ult 99% of the time.\n\nFurther more, he is easy to build as he does so much healing that it's unecessary to buff it. You can slap virtually any piece of gear on him as his base multipliers and defensive stats are so high that he will often be the last unit standing. His weapon/LC is a free slot for any of the strong Abundance LCs so you don't have to pull for anything but his base copy. The man is a pillar.\n\nChangli in WuWa is my favorite unit in the game. She is the perfect intersection of versatility, power, and comfort in every mode of Wuwa.\n\nHer available and easily accessible and short cd burst damage is split into multiple strong buttons that can be saved for opportune times and don't expire which make her feel amazing in the open-world as you nuke mob packs while exploring. She has a nice skill ceiling in endgame challenge modes with allow you see your own progression of skill as a player by ramping up the speed of rotations. Her teams are wide and varied, having multiple high performing partners which add variety to teams to play her in and allow your account to more easily fill a niche should you not have the perfect team built to handle a battle. Her short cd burst dmg is great in all the endgame modes and her focus on multiple skill dmg types (Skill, Forte, Lib/Ult) lets her use multiple event buffs.",
