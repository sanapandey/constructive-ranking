These include simple questions such as those related to receiving game assistance, game recommendation requests or help finding a specific game, and other general discussions that don't warrant a dedicated thread or aren't directly related to gacha gaming (provided they are not Banned Content).\n\nSome specific examples of what these megathreads should be used for include:\n\n* Help remembering an old gacha game, or finding a new one to start playing\n* Recommendations for the best emulator to use on your device\n* Receiving updates on how ongoing games are doing from current players (\u201cHow is \\[game\\] doing these days?\u201d)\n* Learning what people\u2019s favorite games or types of games are, as well as how others feel about a particular game feature, event, monetization strategy, etc. in specific games\n* Getting clarification on what confusing or game-specific abbreviations mean\n* Finding where people learn about games or like to get their news and information from\n* Discovering new content creators that other Summoners watch or recommend\n* Asking for any sort of general advice relating to gacha games at all\n* Discussing other topics that are only indirectly related to gacha, such as subreddit meta or industry happenings\n\nGenerally, anything asking a question or requiring the opinions of others belongs here. We have many veteran Summoners who are happy to share their opinions and answers, or discuss the topics you may be interested in!\n\nIf you want to contribute, please first read the request or question thoroughly, before making sure not to recommend something already tried or provide the same advice as a previous comment left in response. Please also reply as neutrally as possible, without bashing games or arguing with others in the community\u2013 this is not about winning or losing, but sharing useful information that helps out another member. Replies should include the full names of anything mentioned, as new Summoners may not know what \u201cGI\u201d, \u201cFGO\u201d, or even \u201cF2P\u201d means. Even if they do, it's still helpful so that the results are easily searchable and others who aren't the OP can better follow along.\n\nAs a general reminder, both Reddiquette and all of our Subreddit Rules still apply here. Make sure to keep things respectful! Religious or political topics, sharing personal information, and other rule-breaking behavior are banned. Accounts involved in sharing these may be subject to disciplinary action at moderator discretion.\n\nWith that said, feel free to discuss whatever here and make acquaintance with your friendly gacha gaming neighbors!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Helpful General Resources**\n\n* [Full Subreddit Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/rules/)\n* [For Gaming Addiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/index/resources_for_gaming_addiction/)\n* [For Game Subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/resource/related_subreddits/)\n* [For Game Guides](https://gacha.cc/pryd_rgg)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Hot News & Topics from the Previous Month**\n\n* [How's the Valentine event shaping up in your gacha?

When the storm is over, it \"reverses\" the area and rewinds it to a previous time period. During the period before the storm arrives, Storm Syndrome happens. It's somewhat of a toss up, it could mutate the surrounding area and creatures, it could cause severe mental issues. In the first arc of the game, the stock market crash in combination with the storm syndrome causes humans to see their money, gold, and other wealth possessions as food, and they started eating them.\n\nThe foundation is the organization that Vertin works for, both the foundation and the bad guys \"Manus Vindictae\" are attempting to study and possibly use the storm.\n\nI'm not sure how far you've gotten, but certain materials and things are immune to the storm.  Arcanists are resistant to storm syndrome. The foundation building is heavily storm resistant, iirc the masks that the manus wear also have something in them that makes them resistant to the storm.",

Each hero has four skills, three passive and their ultimate, which is the only one the player can control. Some do AoE damage, single-target damage, some heal/buff, summon cover, etc. At low levels/difficulties it's overlevel and unga-bunga to victory. At high difficulties it's time to read guides, watch team comp vids, and look at Excel spreadsheets, pulling your hair out malding for criticals and praying for RNG. It's God-awful.\n\nStory: B\n\nInteresting prologue, boring volume 1, boring volume 2, volume 3 boring until halfway point and then the story *finally* gets interesting. Has dumb holes like \"here's this multi-billion-dollar metropolis I built in secret without anyone noticing and to learn where I got the money you have to play a side event.\" There are moments that are interesting but the characters carry the entire thing from start to finish. I didn't like it in the least and now I have to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder for saying that.\n\nCharacters: S++\n\nPeak and basically the game's strongest point. Their interactions with each other and you in the story, side stories, character stories, and events is what's kept me playing daily for two years straight.\n\nGacha system: A+\n\nPull for the rate-up hero, watch in dismay as nine blue and one gold pop up on screen, holler in joy when the purple you wanted finally comes up or keep cranking the lever until you reach pity at 200 pulls. Game heaps gems on you, especially when you're new, to the tune of 100 pulls a month. Some of the raids also give out tickets you can use to pull for that sweet, sweet three-star loli lugging around a machine gun that's bigger than her.\n\nDailies: S\n\nThey're five minutes or less. You can do them while you're in the bathroom at work, shirking your responsibilities. It takes more time for the game to boot up than it does to do dailies.",

Past BA units + low rarity units still see some use.\n\n GI's kind of alright, but has seen a bit of powercreep as of late (Mavuika). HSR p much just resorted to actively punishing players who pulled for outdated/older carries. Hell, even 2.X carries are beginning to struggle vs. recent endgame. But then again, that's to be expected when the gacha tries to shill the shiny new toy.",

                    "body": "Depends on what the gameplay is, FGO is one of the very few where you can literally get away with the oldest characters because of how the niche is constructed in the battle system in almost any situation unless the boss has some really niche battle mechanics. For others, GBF usually tries to bring back older units through characters updates. But as long as its on-element unless it's null element, old characters still have some use.\n\nSorry for this long comment:\n\nIf HSR was similar to what GBF was, because it had that potential(a friend even complained why they didn't do it similar), it wouldn't be punishing to older characters, because the way GBF works is that new metas only has speed in its potential in most cases outside harder raid bosses, but everything else is doable with older characters since most min-maxing applies to two things: **1.) the elemental weapon grid which you can either farm, or pull(all with fixed stats); 2.) and the main character itself, whom can switch to basically any class/role, is also fighting alongside you.** This means those two things alone can adapt and revolve around the party you choose and vice-versa. And due to weapon grids having varying effects on parties that you can also mix and match, it can adapt well on different characters, eg. elemental enmity(lower current % HP, higher DMG) vs stamina(opposite to enmity), or even combined enmity + stamina grids, normal magna builds, etc. **Basically, the weapon grid provides the biggest boost in damage whatever the party is dealing,** the party is just there to ensure the damage is actually being done. This is one reason why GBF has one of the most exhaustive theorycrafting versus any other gacha that I know. It's the only gacha also so far that I know that has this extensive battle variation in battle mechanics and builds, so people liken it to a mini-MMO. The only reason why you want specific characters is only for raid bosses with extreme damage/triggers, even then those bosses gets pushed out once new equipment, classes, etc. comes in([like older raid bosses took 1 hour to finish with full 6 teams in the raid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v7C6JQ8Rjg), then it becomes a cakewalk 10 mins or [even solo 1 team fight after the next few updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUvthWHMWUM) that any elemental characters can fight).\n\nI personally think this is one reason why Hoyoverse characters can get outdated in both GI and HSR, **it's because 90% of the battleplay relies on the characters themselves**. The relics/artifacts are already there just to boost stats and certain elemental boosts of specific attacks or sets, but it doesn't help min-max if the substats are already hard to maximize due to PRNG. Basically, if the character's skills doesn't favor in battle, there's no way to work around it unless you either try to really farm on PRNG gear, pull multiple copies of the same character, or just to bench them completely. Kurogames's also has this with WuWa, it's just not that noticeable at the moment because it's still new. **It also doesn't help that MC/Trailblazer/Traveler/Rover isn't as adaptive** as Gran/Djeeta in GBF, whom basically [has access to an insane number of classes](https://gbf.wiki/Class_List) that makes them practically capable of using every type of weapon in the game, which really adapts to any situation. Where Gran/Djeeta is right there just outright true to their lore game-wise, there is no best class, only which class to use per battle. Meanwhile, you'll barely even use most of Trailblazer/Traveler/Rover's other sets outside very specific situations or if you don't have anyone else, you sub them with it.\n\nThis is one plague of equipment relying randomness on stats, which isn't really an issue on MMOs, where this was originally from, due to various factors of party formation, but for single-player gachas, it is. This pushes players to roll for new characters instead of being able to work around their older characters. **FYR, Mihoyo's Guns Girl Z, their oldest gacha, didn't suffer from that issue, primarily because the game was purely equipment-based battleplay** and characters were mostly skin. I have high hopes on AK: Endfield because of this due to their lack of PRNG on gear.\n\nFor BA, that's just because of real MALD boss fights in torment and trying to achieve top ranking with very annoying boss niches. FWIW you can definitely clear bosses with older characters it just won't be as fast enough in a lot of cases. Like last time with Binah, S.Kanna only became meta 'cause she had the highest stackable DEF down over Akane, but you can still definitely do Binah with Akane. Why BA works has to do with both armor and attack type, this gives a lot more varied parties plus all characters are capable of full investments through eligma. It's not like in GI/HI, where you might really need to bench characters because you literally have no use for them anymore.\n\nI've quit a lot of others, so I don't really know how they treat old characters now currently, so I can't speak much for that nowadays. GBF I also quit, but they had an extensive pattern that repeated a number of times, which is why I can atleast attest to that. GBF is close to what older classic JRPGs are which are tested and true, where farmable equipment can make a larger difference in battle.",

It has significantly higher production value than all of its competition, with a ridiculous amount of interactivity with your virtual boyfriend, that actively learns preferences from your dialogue choices, a ton of skin options that can be combined to make customized outfits, and near-movie quality CGI with lip-syncing to your selected language.

You can have a pretty good quality game, but if it's not gaining any traction with its appeal, it's not doing it any favors. Since you're trying to appeal mostly to female players, they're not as numerous and the preference of Eastern Asian vs other global regions aren't really the same.\n\nSo if a 2D otome gacha would appear, it would need to hit preferences of a lot of potential female players. You can head down to [r/otomegames](https://www.reddit.com/r/otomegames) to see how much people even like otome games on a global setting. Since most otome games are VN-styles, they don't don't have the same mass appeal as other mainstream VN genres. It's not that they are bad quality in general, it's just that the number of players aren't that much to begin with.\n\nA lot of gacha is either geared towards males or mass appeal, which also happen to have more males to that extent in terms of character designs, which is one reason for revenue per banner release. Not to say all of them, just a lot of them.\n\nI say LaDS had a more global appeal because it's 3D which usually does have more appeal in general, and like you mention it's like K-pop idols' designs, and probably a lot of its female players don't like 2D anime-style from the start.",

I've played quite a few otome games but not any gacha games so I can't speak out of LaDS. Otome games have a lot of dating sims and elements, it's just that it has a VN format on most of them since it's a lot easier to implement than full-pledged gameplays with RPG elements.  There's barely any RPGs/non-VNs with otome games to begin with, mostly it'll be with games that have a playable female/male MC with male love targets like Story of Seasons/P3P. The closest of recent memory that is an RPG is an indie called [Silent Kingdom](https://luckycatotome.itch.io/thesilentkingdom-demo).\n\nSo it's strongly possible that LaDs may have had that advantage in regards to a differentiation in gameplay. \n\nI still think it is also has to do with preference in visual style. The reason why I say it's also possible 3D had a larger appeal over 2D is primarily because of Korean ikemen's popularity to begin with. There's a lot of women that love that like k-pop/k-drama/asian drama/asian/korean males that doesn't automatically like anime and vice-versa. And LaDS has that appeal for the usual ikemen, and follow it up with what people describe, having a lot of dating and interaction elements.\n\nLike I personally don't wanna use twitter as a generalization of anecdotal examples, but I've followed LaDS the past months, and there are quite a lot of twitter accounts who play LaDS that never have had any twitter interaction with anything anime when I checked them. Of course that's not to say, all of them, but it's possible that these people are people who do play games/mobile games but does not prefer anime games to begin with. So it's possible that visual preference is also in play here.\n\n>Also the fact is like well a otome VN vs an 3d virtual boyfriend ... or some sort like that\n\nThat's the thing, there's barely any 3D otome games to begin with as well. I can't even think of one on the top of my head.",

                    "body": "For R1999 I'd say\n\nPros: \n\n* Story is quite good, not standard tropes, unique setting, great art\n* Interesting characters with unique stories, as long as you're not looking for strong male representation, 90+% of the cast is female. Also very little if any fanservice, most women wear realistic outfits(I guess that can be a con to some).\n* Low time investment needed per day, it takes very little time to get your daillies/weeklies done, with replay+speed up+sweep systems.\n* If you're familiar with Arknights systems, it copies most of them so it's very easy to get into.\n* No gear(relics/artifacts etc) RNG farming, only character banners(no weapons and such gacha). Overall pretty F2P friendly. Chars go into standard pool after 3 patches so 50/50 losses aren't a horrible waste as you can get very good ones.\n* Pretty fun combat imo if you're into turn based stuff.\n\nCons:\n\n* Has similar cons as Arknights, a lot of the account progression is tied to current events. Outside events(and one-time rewards), you don't get many materials , you have to be picky on what you level even though you'll be given a ton of chars.\n* True limited banners(banners that only rerun once a year) create FOMO and some of the limited chars are vastly overpowered(Anjo Nala recently). That said because the game is a few months behind China, you can plan your pulls ahead so not that bad.\n* Combat can also be a con if you're not into this type of combat. There's not much you can do to \"outplay\" the enemies, and a lot of your victories are decided from the moment you select your team, having the right chars will make hard fights easy, not having them can make them close to impossible(mostly the recent Reverie stuff).\n* Autoplay is dogshit so you do have to play manually a bunch unless overgeared. I don't mind it but I know some people like to just auto everything so worth noting.",

The gacha rates are decent overall but it's pretty expensive to spark and it's hard to consistently hit the most broken units which are generally hard to replace in the near term since the game mostly revolves around support characters and damage units are mostly interchangeable.",

Whether or not you like his writing is pretty subjective.\n\nOverall, I enjoy everything about this game besides the actual gameplay.\n\nI personally wish it was just legitimately a full visual novel instead because the dungeons are insanely boring, uninspired, and [linear](https://imgur.com/MSbIy4U) to a fault. They're basically just straight corridors with random combat encounters (why), and the gameplay of spending tons of turns buffing your attacker to unleash one giga-attack is cool for boss fights but really tedious when it comes to just fighting random mobs. When dungeons showed up I always had an overwhelming urge to just put the entire thing on auto and tab out for 15 minutes until my character reached the end because I felt there was literally zero reason to bother exploring or engaging with the dungeon gameplay.",

The story is also not gated with the stamina so you can play as much as you want.\n\n\n\n\n\nAether Gazer\n\n\n\nthis is a hack and slash action , it is very f2p friendly, It has the best banner format also imo\n\n\n\nhas 90 guarantee character banner without 50/50, meaning if a non-featured 5star appears your pity doesnt reset\n\n\n\nhas 70 guarantee character banner with 50/50, meaning if a non-featured 5star appears your pity will reset\n\n\n\nthe weapon banner is 70 guaranteed without 50/50, you also dont have to wait for reruns, their weapons are always available you just need to pick from the options and awaken it on the character that you want.\n\n\n\nit has trial characters, no need to worry that you wont clear the story if your characters are not built, you can simply use the trial characters.\n\n\n\nyou control 1 character and 2 characters are controlled by AI, you still control team skills since you have 2 characters controlled by AI, once your characters are built, you can basically AFK on dailies\n\n\n\nthere is a guild system, you can try out other characters of your guildmates in some modes\n\n\n\nAether Gazer also fixes any bugs from CN patch before putting it to Global, Punishing Gray Raven is known to put the CN patch including its bugs to Global. (not sure if PGR still do that but that's how they do things back then)",

You get 1 free roll daily for each banner. And they have constant events that give characters for free.

There is a mode called Imaginarium theater that has stages you can complete depending on how many characters you have (over level 70). This is the only mode that will take time until you get enough characters. Abyys (another end game mode) 12th floor might take some time as well depending on which characters you get but it doesn't have a hard cap like the theater.\n\nHeard Wuthering Waves is f2p friendly as well but didn't play much.

So I never actually forgotten it.\n\nI didn't see anything about the game being terminated or cancelled, but I never seen anything about the game since. Back then, QApp had its sepcial page up, even had its Cards Gacha Collab, which I pretty much collected each cards available on the list. But I can't see that page no longer.  \nIs the game closed for good?\n\nI asked since what I find on web are contents that's was pretty much 'old' by now.

However, they did announce a major change going forward (in terms of storytelling) that might positively affect the pacing, which was basically extending the entire major patch (aka entirety of 3.X) to cover the new planet & story.\n\nPreviously, as you're well-aware, each major patch consisted of two stories (e.g. Belobog & XZ for 1.X, Pencony and XZ for 2.X). This resulted in some boring transitional and filler patches here and there, which will hopefully be fixed given the change. \n\nMoving on to power-creep, if you're not following leaks, feel free to leave this part out. >!We're currently at the tipping point where I believe the game could significantly and drastically go downhill in the near future. In the next patch, we'll be celebrating HSR's 2nd anniversary. With that comes the introduction of a brand new shiny character called Castorice. Hoyo is clearly attempting to recreate the success of their previous anniversary (Acheron), and will be introducing a new mechanic into the game to nudge people towards spending and pulling for this brand new toy. This new mechanic is a **GLOBAL** passive, that allows you to revive a fallen character regardless of whether Castorice is in the team. As of right now, all leaks point towards this new mechanic working in endgame modes (e.g. MOC, PF, AS). !<\n\n  \n>!You might think that \"Hey, a revive doesn't sound that bad, what's so bad about that?\". But rather, said introduction acts as the opening of Pandora's Box. In the future, we are 100000% sure to receive characters that apply global passives as well (+X% damage, +X Speed, etc.). And the power-creep will be infinitely worse than what we have now. Imagine not pulling for some character that you have absolutely zero interest in, guess what? You fucked up now. Because that character gives +10 global speed, which allows  the shiny new flagship character in 5.X that has a base speed of 124 speed to run attack boots. (If you're not into HSR, 124+10 speed = 134 speed, which is an optimal speed breakpoint for endgame modes and character building in general.!<\n\nAside from the leak above, other problems in terms of power-creep just became more obvious to the general playerbase. HP inflation on endgame modes, new shiny characters coming out that do more damage at E0-E2 compared to older E6s, very specific MOC buffs that might as well go \"If you don't have XXX character in your team, suffer\".",

So If you enjoyed Penacony, then everything after (aside of 2.6) is better or equally as good. The story of Amphoreus isn't over yet, so they can always fuck it up by the end, but so far it's pretty promising and 3.1 was actually peak.\n\n Powercreep though is indeed a big issue, the devs acknowledged it and promised to fix it, so we just have to wait.",

With 2.6, sure it was pretty nonsensical at first, but the ending where we learn about Rappa's past and even Boothill's made it pretty informative, along with what Dr Primitive's true goal was, while it even gave the whole philosophical debate of \"is it worth giving up agency and independent thought (i.e. submitting to the whole banana memetic virus and regressing mentally) in exchange for never having to suffer or struggle?\".\n\n2.7 didn't exactly do much to move the needle in terms of the story plot nor shed much light on the new characters. With Sunday it's more or less a redemption arc with him coming to terms with his new position in life, nothing too bad there, but with Tingyun/Fugue I felt it was a little too shoehorned in, especially with her appearance in Penacony which felt kinda forced. We could have just the meeting with her and Yukong on the Luofu and it would be fine, I feel the Penacony part with her didn't do much. Overall, I felt the 2.7 patch gave up story for what was basically fanservice with highly desired/recurring characters, while 2.6 had to put its best foot forward since Rappa was a complete unknown.",

It pains me to think that my choice would be ZZZ.\n\nNow, about ETE Chronicles, I\u2019d like to play it, but I don\u2019t have time.  \nSo I'll probably drop WuWa in favor of Exidria (Magia Record 2), probably GFL2, EverSoul, and Eminence in Shadow, I am not sure if Exidria will better that Burns Red.",

Gameplay is Xcom without your hero missing all their shots on a 99% chance four feet from the target (and the gameplay at large is *very* easy). Gacha is outrageously generous with giving out gems and tickets, the girls are all quite cute, and the fan service is optional skins. You *could* buy the bikini skin that features a top desperately trying to hold the girl's front line if yaknowhatimean and spend an hour in the dorm, lining up the camera so you can ~~drool aggressively~~ stare respectfully, or you could just ignore all that.

Damn, I played Genshin for three years ignoring artefacts completely \u2014 just left the slots empty (or with random lvl0 pieces for set bonuses) because I didn\u2019t want to bother, and rarely my struggles were unbearable.\n\nIn HSR, though\u2026 I got stuck during a story quest.

It's not an overnight success, it's a marathon.\n\n\nIn here, the grind stage (Hunt especially) has gacha currency and gems (Skystones) in the drop list so even if you don't get good gear out of it, you still \"get something\". And in this case, it's a progression in character collection. I think this answers your question?\n\n\nPve wise, progression is easy thanks to the free stuff you get as a newbie so you don't really need to grind. I imagine the newbies that started during last year's anniversary are having it much easier, considering the ***MANY*** free stuff they got.\n\n\nPvp wise, for normal arena or guild war battle in which you fight AI controlled teams, naturally it's a much harder than pve stuff, but since it is AI, you can tell which move is coming next. Not to mention you have the whole advantage of knowing who their characters are so you can set up a counter team. Grinding is needed to progress but not that much unless you are a sweaty player that wants to rank high. If you want, you can even treat it as pve.\n\n\nReal time arena pvp on the other hand, you are in a world of hurt if your gear are bad, but even if they are good, if you have bad drafting and decision making skill, you can still lose to those with worse gear. And then there is luck, if you watch the world championship matches, some wins were thanks to luck.\n\nEdit: btw, the good reward for rta is pretty much only skin which you can buy via shop later so you can simply ignore rta.\n\nSo, based on my almost 2 years of playing (though I sometimes take a break), imo you grind only if you:\n\n\n1. Are f2p that want easier time collecting all characters.\n2. Rank high in rta pvp.\n\n\nOther than that, if you are the casual type, you can just sweep Hunts and AI pvp, do the other dailies, and close the game in around 3 minutes after opening it.",

There's no finetuning substat per substat, a scroll rerolls all substats (but at least you can keep the current substats when you reroll).\n\nA hero has 4 pieces of gear that can be enchanted. Scrolls also form sets when used on 2/4 pieces of gear.\n\nIt's relatively easy to get one maxed substat (usually the main one, like %ATK for a physical DPS). Even getting good rolls in 2 substats is achievable. The RNG nightmare begins when you want good rolls in all 3 substats.\n\nGood news, it costs absolutely nothing to unequip gear.

Also Tower of Fantasy but MMO.\n\nOther Hoyo games: HSR for turn based and Zenless Zone Zero for button-mashing action, both are newer so they have better QoL and visuals than Genshin,\n\nnewly released Tribe Nine, combination of 2.5D chibi pixel world exploration + full 3d model stage action combat jrpg.\n\nStory-Focused & Turn-based: Limbus Company highly regarded, Reverse 1999, both chibi/mini model. Heaven Burns Red, full 3d model.\n\nTraditional Jrpg style, Octopath Traveler: Cotc, and Another Eden,\n\nMobile only, Wizardry Daphne, newest title of ancient jrpg 1981?, dungeon-crawling turnbased.\n\nGuardian Tales is great for fans old school Legend of Zelda games.\n\nBrownDust 2 is a unique gameplay(2d chibi gameplay), but lots of gacha draws and fanservice.\n\nTower Defense genre, Tower defense for Arknights (2d chibi gameplay) and path to nowhere(3d model gameplay), And Ash of Echoes is like half TD,\n\nSword of Convallaria is similar to FF Tactics, and Langrisser,\n\nStage Action, Punishing Gray Raven and Aether Gazer,\n\nPvp focused, Epic Seven, Black Clover Mobile, 7 Deadly Sins Grandcross, Counterside,\n\nI didnt Include most afk/idle gameplay gachas, i wouldnt recommend for newbie,",

This has created a problem where not only the demands for DPS keep increasing, but as HSR is a team-based game, it implores you to gacha for entire archetypes to comfortably keep up with the highest levels of the modes. This has lead to a lot of frustration surrounding unit investment and long-term viability.  \n\nThis is also a problem as endgame modes make up a good portion of the endgame content, and there's been both a reduction in the number of events and length of events; there are less of them and they're quite short, and sometimes the \"events\" are simple check-in/exchange quests instead of minigames or hours-long side stories like they used to be. \n\nLack of things to do isn't as much of a problem this patch, 3.1, as HSR released a massive update/overhaul to one of its roguelite modes that's been well-received and considered an upgrade to the previous iteration.\n\nStory is overall received pretty well too, in the previous patch there were issues with the story presentation where people complained about dull camerawork, multiple instances of black screen with white text instead of animations or CGs, and many puzzles forcing backtracks along pretty large maps. This was much less of a problem in 3.1. \n\nI've also seen some people say the story is bloated as the length of the main quests have gotten longer and there's a lot more character focus, but from what I've seen this is mostly from a vocal minority and general consensus is that the story is good and going in an interesting direction. \n\nThe devs have addressed some of these issues and are working on fixing them, including a promise to buff older units, but we have no details on what and when that will be.",

It's totally fine to use them as ellipsis to basically explain that some time passed, for example because your character tells another what just happened, or to just note it's a different day or whatever. In 3.0 though you had some blackscreens that were purely there to replace the need to try to animate anything that's not 2 chars standing up in front of each other talking. At some point Dan Heng fights some titan thing and it goes black screen \"Dan Heng pierces the enemy with his spear in one swift motion\" or some bullshit like that, cause they're too lazy to try to make the basic attack animations work in cinematics somehow. \n\nI wouldn't say it was like a major issue or anything, but it was pretty glaring in the 3.0 story the way they used it a few times to just replace what usually should have been a simple cutscene with combat animations/more complex actions, because they just, kinda can't do these for some reason? It's very weird how rigid the cutscenes are in HSR considering how many there are since it's a pretty story driven game.\n\nA lot of the issues are relatively small on their own but they kinda pile up together, and then the more negative people are, the more negative the community gets in some vicious cycle. It doesn't help that they come up with some new bullshit to fuel the negativity frequently enough(see Castorice passive).",

Many of those games were just really bad, poor quality trash that doesn't take any thought at all.  Then I have also played all the Hoyo games. Which are kind of the opposite problem. While I think those are all really high quality its actually too a point where I don't think games like Hoyo games really fit my initial desire for a fun game on my phone. Those games feel more like a console or pc game that they put gacha into.\n\nMy favorite gacha is probably Counter Side, although I also really like Nikke.  Complex enough to warrant attention from your brain cells, but doesn't have stuff like huge world exploration or manual action combat.  Those are the kinds of things best left to console or pc gaming. I am looking to branch out some to try other games what would you suggest as a good phone game to fit more in line with what I have said already?",

Other than those two I'm playing **FGO, Memento mori** and **GFL2** as well.\n\n  \nI've tried **Snowbreak, Azurlane** and **Nikke** but to be honest they felt kind of too shallow and couldnt get into them, dropped after a while. So any kind of recommendation other than those titles would be a great help. I'm kind of interested in ZZZ and Wuwa as well but I dont know if they could satisfy me in the affection regard so I'd be glad if any players can give some thoughts about it.\n\n\n\nI'm personally okay with lewd / 18+ gachas as well as long as they are not too shallow but dunno if any good of them exists.",

Passively it's an idle RPG that demands very little daily time investment, with everything being sweepable in around 10-15 minutes every day once you cleared it once. Active gameplay consists largely of 5v5 autobattles with a variety of game modes surrounding that concept and good depth to characters and team building aspects. Story and VN presentation is done through full 3D models, with chibi variants for some game modes and voiced segments in Korean and partial Japanese.\n> \n> What are the characters like?\n> It's a harem gacha with a self insert male MC where almost all the girls are for (you). There are currently 82 Souls with a good variety in character designs, personalities and archetypes, including angels, demons, cute kemonos with ears and tails and even filthy elves. Character bond stories and events feature multiple Live2D illustrations and get you alternate costumes for free! Story and previous events are available right away so you're not missing any character development. You can also touch their boobs in the menus if you want.\n\n\nimage showing some of the girls:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ssWzVdp",
