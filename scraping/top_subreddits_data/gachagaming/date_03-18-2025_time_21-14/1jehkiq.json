I dont think they are even arguing that own the assents of that game.\n\nLooking like Front Line doesnt mean its Front Line just like the NFL doesnt have to pay USARL because Football and Rugby look similar.",

My very limited knowledge of licensing deals lead me to believe likely not. If the mechs don't look distinctly FM mechs, I'm not sure how much of a case SE has here.",

            "body": ">While never giving permission to Ten Tree, Square Enix says it did license the Front Mission IP to Shanghai Zishun Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Zishun) in 2019 to develop and operate a game worldwide. This game, Front Mission -2089: Borderscape, was developed but was never released. Square Enix later terminated the license agreement, maintaining that all copyrights remained with Square Enix.\n\n>Square Enix filed the legal complaint at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. It believes the court has jurisdiction because after it filed a DMCA takedown notice with Valve in February, Ten Tree filed a counter-notification with Valve, meaning that it consented to the jurisdiction in which Valve resides in Bellevue, Washington.\n\n>Square Enix wants a trial by jury and seeks damages and Ten Tree\u2019s profits from METAL STORM, which are currently unknown. Alternatively, it seeks a maximum of $150,000 for each copyright violation. In addition to those, Square Enix demands reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees and full legal costs, and a temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to restrain and enjoin Ten Tree\u2019s continued actions.",
