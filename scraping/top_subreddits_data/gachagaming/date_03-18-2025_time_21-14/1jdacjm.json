Ever since Gregor's character teaser/pv before Limbus' release, I've always found him to be really good! The guttural screams, the helplessness, he just sounds so good as Gregor. I really can't wait for Greg to get a bit of extra spotlight in the future, reach his \"potential\" and all that, if only to hear Choi Han absolutely slay with his voice acting.",

Hopefully I\u2019ll be proven wrong soon though.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ff8g3fpw49pe1.jpeg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91ceb700c3285a1b3d875baf099e36e6b8144f83",
