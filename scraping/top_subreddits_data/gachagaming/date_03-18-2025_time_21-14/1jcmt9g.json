    "selftext": "The only gacha game I play that has a dedicated White Day event is Fate/Grand Order, which features story events and special Craft Essences specifically for the White Day event. Each year, they alternate between introducing a new male character and giving an existing male character a new costume. Are there any other gacha games that also have a dedicated White Day event? If so, what content do they include in the event?\u201d",

            "body": "White Day is a Japanese holiday, so it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s mostly Japanese gacha games that celebrate White Day. \n\nSome other Japanese gacha with White Day events include\u2026\n* *Alchemy Stars* (RIP): White Day was a little different every year, but I remember a consistent feature was that you could earn \u201cdark chocolate\u201d to give to male characters to raise their affinity levels. And although AS doesn\u2019t have the equivalent of FGO\u2019s craft essences, the official AS social media accounts always posted gorgeous White Day illustrations every year. Plus there were some amazing White Day skins (like Pittman\u2019s outfit).\n* *Puzzles&Dragons*: Has a \u201cWhite Day Dungeon\u201d that only lasts for one day but drops rare and powerful feeder mats. Happy farming.\n* *Divine Gate* (RIP): Had a dedicated White Day event, \u201cSweets Grand Maison,\u201d which repeated every year. During the event you could farm for White Day-themed feeder materials and a free SS unit, Atsuyoshi (who was the betrothed of the free Valentine Day\u2019s unit, Ise). \n* *Battle Cats*: Has a special White Day gacha every year in which you can roll for ultra-rare White Day units. \n* *Dragon Poker*: Gives an SS selector ticket every year for White Day. \n* *Granblue Fantasy*: I don\u2019t play GBF, but u/RoryFuckingMercury already filled in the details below.\n\nAlso\u2026 I do find it interesting that more and more Korean/Chinese gacha games are doing fun little things to celebrate White Day, even if not full dedicated White Day events. I mean, hey, it\u2019s a holiday about hot guys and chocolate. Even in girls-only gacha games, it\u2019s still an opportunity for the MC to give gifts to the girls and get to experience their responses. As far as marketing for a gacha game goes, White Day is basically a golden opportunity served up on a silver platter. Even if White Day did start as a Japanese-only holiday. (Although I would argue that, like Valentine\u2019s Day before it, White Day is becoming more and more internationalized.)",
