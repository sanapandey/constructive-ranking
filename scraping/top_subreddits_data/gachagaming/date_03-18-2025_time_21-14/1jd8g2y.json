Legendary/Red/highest quality have 4 substats and the weapons and accessories have a unique passive (based on class and what boss drops them).\n\n\nThey have Hunts for weapon/accessories and then pieces, one for each of the 5 elements so 10 total. They have hunt quests for the earth/fire/water on both so a total of 6 free characters and if you complete their missions you get 6 star gear foe all their slots (including max affection and a talisman which are \"special\" equipment).\n\n\nJust the fact they have a thing called precise crafting where at least once a month (can use Ether their pull currency for up to 2 more times) you can make a \"perfect\" base piece, you get the gems you need to craft reroll the stats from their daily/weekly island.\n\n\nThey changed their gacha so now instead of the normal banner you have a selector and can pick from a list of 3 units.",

She's given away for free now.  \n5-10 needed immunity and cleanses, which was either Astei (who did release at the same time) or Faenan (a 2-star). There's 2 more options for that now, and you can headhunt them via the permanent custom banner.  \nWith the Quirks system the stat requirement is much easier to reach.\n\nThe new player experience is very different from over a year ago.",

My guess is we get 2 have it runs for 6-8 weeks. Maybe we get a welfare (would be a first usually you just get shards for associated 3 stars, not enough to summon them but helps save a few days if your farming their daily shards). Recently changed it so you have incremental stat buffs every 150 shards (you get 50 for a spook and 150 for a rate up pull or 15 a day excluding the Demiurge and limited units).",
