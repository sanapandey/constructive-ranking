This is Dynamis One.\n\nWe have been receiving several inquiries regarding recent investigations by investigative agencies.\n\nOur position on this matter is as follows:\n\nOur company was searched and seized on charges of \"leaking trade secrets related to 'MX Blade', which was under development by Nexon Games.\"\n\nSince this is an ongoing investigation, it is difficult to reveal specific details, but there are many parts of the content of the power that are different from the facts.\n\nWe will actively cooperate with the investigation by the investigative authorities and strive to clearly reveal the facts.\n\nthank you\n\nPark Byeong-rim, CEO of Dynamis One\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ukrm08wzodpe1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=374e08dab90e67e75e2db9dfc2851715a081e41f",
