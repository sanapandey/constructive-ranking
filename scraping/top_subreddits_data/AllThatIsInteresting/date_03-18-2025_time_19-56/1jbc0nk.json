I don't know if you saw this but both people (his parents) also tried to tear the locks off before running out of a burning building.  It's all part of the puzzle which decides if this was a misguided idea of parenting or these people meant him intentional harm.  Lastly, I have read more than one account of parents that take there kids out of the system to be home schooled, can wind up to cases of extreme child abuse (Ruby Franke and her girlfriend) missing or dead.  There needs to be an amendment passed the home schooled kids need home assessments and confidential interviews.  I do not see this as a violation of the parents rights but more of preserving the rights of a child to be brought up in a safe environment .  This is clunkily worded but I hope I'm getting my view across.",
