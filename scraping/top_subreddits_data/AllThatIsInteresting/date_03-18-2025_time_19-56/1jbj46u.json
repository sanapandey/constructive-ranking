            "body": "> Garrett Bardsley, a 12-year-old Boy Scout, went camping with his father, brothers, and other Boy Scouts in Utah\u2019s Uinta Mountains in late August 2004. It was meant to be a fun trip before the start of a new school year. But what had begun as an enjoyable outing in the wilderness would unexpectedly turn to tragedy.\n\n> Garrett got up early on the morning of August 20th to go fishing with his father at one of the nearby lakes, but the boy would soon mysteriously vanish on his way back to camp. And though the search for him was initiated within just 15-20 minutes of when he was last seen, neither Garrett nor the fishing pole he\u2019d been carrying would ever be located.\n\n[Read more](https://mshort.substack.com/p/garrett-bardsley-utah-boy-scout-vanishes)",

He broke away and vanished into a forest.  Many searches later, they eventually declared him missing. There had been a fairly publicized dispute between  the two countries over who was responsible for finding him.  He was eventually found hanging high up in the tree canopy by a German logger.  It can happen.  I was a part of his funeral detail when his remains were transported back to the States and laid to rest.",

And if he died very shortly after that reaction (i.e. crushed windpipe or skull) he might have continued clutching it after rigor mortise set in. Heard a story about a couple of welders up here who were attacked by a cougar; the first victim was working on something with a tool and the cougar snuck up and killed him so fast he was found still kneeling on the ground with the tool clutched in his hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0",

Noticed how I mentioned that that welder was the 1st victim? Well his buddy was found much later because he got dragged off and stashed.\u00a0\n\n\nThat might actually be why they can't find him. There's been a few cases of people disappearing and their remains being found years later stuck up in trees. In a lot of those cases though it was actually people who who climbed up there themselves for various reasons.\u00a0",

Children and small women by themselves are who they often target.  Or their pets",

Almost every mountain lion attack on people was against one or two people with a small dog. They go for the dog, the dog runs back to the people for protection, the cougar attacks the people.  \n  \nI have seen one in my life in the wild. I was alone at night and shined my flashlight at it, we both watched each other pretty closely but it didn't try to get any closer to me. I'm a pretty big guy at 6'2\" and 200+ lbs. Mountain lions are ambush predators, they don't want to get into a fight where they might get hurt.",
