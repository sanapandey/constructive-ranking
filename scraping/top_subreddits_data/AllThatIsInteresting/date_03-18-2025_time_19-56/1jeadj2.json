I have been here since then, I got my first job at 16 and have worked ever since there. I became a Registered Nurse in 2012 and have worked as one since then.\u00a0\n\nIn 2017, soon after Trump had taken office the first time, my apartment complex\u2019s office notified me that there was a woman claiming to be from the census bureau trying to gain forced access into my apartment. She tried this multiple times and on multiple days. I asked them if it happened again to please call the police, but I was heading to a travel nursing job just a few days after I was notified of this.\u00a0\n\nI went and started my travel contract, and about a week later I get a call from my travel agency saying that I\u2019m not authorized to work in the US because I\u2019m not a legal citizen. Excuse me?! I\u2019d been a taxpayer for many, many years at that point. I had to go to the social security office to see what the issue was, and after waiting for hours I was told that I needed to provide my proof of citizenship, over the phone I was told driver\u2019s license was acceptable, but they turned me away and said I needed my certificate of citizenship or my passport. My passport had expired and my parents had my citizenship certificate since I was traveling away from my home state and did not want to lose it. I had my dad overnight it to me, went back to the SS office, and was told that it\u2019s invalid because it was laminated. I then had to renew my passport, go to the SS office a third time, and they told me that my social security number never reflected me being a citizen. I had to have a new SSN assigned.\u00a0\n\nI refuse to believe any of that was coincidental, I believe that I was very intentionally being targeted and they were trying to make it seem like I was here illegally. I couldn\u2019t work my travel contract for weeks because of this whole ordeal. If I was someone who didn\u2019t have the means to renew my passport and go through all these steps, what would they have done to me?\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t have any empathy for this woman, she was actually a criminal and just because she popped out children doesn\u2019t make her a good person. You broke the law, you took the plea deal, those are the consequences to your actions.\u00a0",

The case was from 2020.  She did her time and then was turned over to ICE.  She was then placed in removal proceedings and ordered removed.  Due to Laos not accepting the return of criminal Laotians she was likely released by ICE on an order of supervision.  The change appears to be that the Trump administration convinced Laos to accept their citizens again and that\u2019s why she was just removed.",

She was questioned on Cartel affiliation (which she was part of) and broader drug trafficking charges (which she did do)\n\nThe weed is not the big part in this, like the title suggests\n\nThis is not even touching if she was a legal Thai citizen, which she most likely was not. Both Thailand and Laos are a lot harsher on illegals/refugees in regards to status \n\nAnd finally she was clearly informed prior to her deportation that she was going to Laos via her plea deal.
