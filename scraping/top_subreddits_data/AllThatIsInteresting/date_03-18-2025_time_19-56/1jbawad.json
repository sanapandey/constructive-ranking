A still image and the testimony of her doctor wasn\u2019t enough evidence. By the time the special ultrasound machine became available - hours later - it was too late to save her. \n\nShe should have been admitted that first day. She should have been treated as soon as they diagnosed her with sepsis. The fetal heartbeat should never have been a deciding factor in whether or not she got the care she needed; her life was worth saving even if it meant ending the life of that fetus. But even after fetal demise - even after that insane prerequisite was met - it was the wait for that second, medically-unnecessary, box-ticking, arse-covering ultrasound that made the difference between life and death for that teenage girl",

Medicine is entirely transactional now, and providers often sacrifice their autonomy as highly-trained caregivers for fear of being sued if a decision they make doesn't lead to the desired outcome.  Instead, they play it safe and check all the boxes their EMR system generates to appease legal and admin.  The patient generally suffers.  \n\nWhat's happening in healthcare is scary and it'll only get worse.  I could talk for days about this. \n\nAll leadership, past and present, bears the blame.  For years they've been making the rules which got us to this sad point.  \n\nWe need to wipe the slate clean, elect officials who actually give a damn, and find a way to unite people that transcends politics or perceived differences.  \n\nBuild on our commonalities, our daily struggles as human beings, and find ways to make things better.  \n\nSystemic change is needed and it'll have to start from the ground up bc those at the top haven't cared in a looong ass time.  \n\n***end rant***",

In fact, I sincerely wish MORE people were like you in that regard.  You seem like a decent person. \n\nA couple thoughts. \n\nWhether something is acceptable to bring up or not depends on a lot of things, context being a major factor.   I know this well.  \n\nAlso, I don't think I mentioned universal healthcare (UH) once.  I speak often of increasing access to life-saving drugs, especially to vulnerable populations, but UH isn't a topic I generally opine about.  \n\nThat said, for me, even when discussing micro-events, it's hard to ignore the big picture and what led us to this point and what can be done to remedy whatever needs fixing. \n\nThese laws directly led to her death.  Most of us agree there.  \n\nI merely want to know who passed these laws?  For why and for what purpose did lobbyists push so hard for these draconian laws?  How did the so-called \"system\" foster an environment in which these laws could not only pass but lead to deaths like the one in Texas?  Who are the corporate leaders and elected officials during all of this?  \n\nBesides ideology, can anyone reasonably and convincingly sell us on the fact that these laws are good for us as citizens?   \n\nThe list could go on, but we need to hold them all accountable.  Enough is enough. \n\nThere are so many issues involved with how and why we provide health care in the U.S., and many, if not all of them, are related to one another, the only variable being how much.  \n\nThese laws have been years in the making, and they'll have ripple effects for years to come if change doesn't happen.  \n\nI'm merely wanting enough passionate, smart people to discuss these matters and find a better way of doing things.\n\nIn disagreement or not, and we agree here IMO, it starts with people like you who genuinely care. \n\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and I'm always open to further discussions.  \n\nKeep doing you and good luck my friend \ud83e\udd19",

To name a few causative factors, and there are many, I'd include big pharma (PBMs), insurance companies/payors, lack of regulatory oversight and the monopolization/vertical integration of large health systems.  Folks in Washington create the laws that allow these shenanigans to persist in the first place.  \n\nThe lawmakers are ultimately to blame for creating the uneven playing field IMO.\n\nI'm actually changing my career to enroll in a medical program mid 2025.  This is after working in health administration for 10 years and being a chronic-disease patient (T1 diabetes) for 30 years. Caregivers, for the most part, are the good ones, and I'd never blame them for this mess.  I'm trying to join NOT blame them.\n\nI hope this clears up your confusion on where I stand.  We're talking birds-eye view here bc this is such a complex issue but I'm interpreting this as we agree on more than we disagree.  \n\nIt's not the doctors .... it's the rigged system.",

At the turn of the century doctors weren't \"professionalized\" like they are today, at least in the US.\u00a0 But because doctors didn't wash their hands or have proper sanitary procedures at the time, the risk of infection dying was so high that skipping the doctor and just engaging in psuedo science could net a higher chance of survival.\u00a0 so doctors weren't necessarily respected in the same way other professionals were everywhere. They needed a way to get people to use their services.\n\n\n\u00a0They took aim at women's health.\u00a0 At this point in history only women dealt with women's health in the US, you had midwives for birth, and women who offered abortion medicine and other things for the rest.\u00a0 There was no official organization for them. Often just individuals who offered these services\u00a0 Wanting to kick women out of women's health, the AMA started to publicly shame these women and make up stuff along with vilifying abortion.\u00a0 Prior to acts like this life began at *birth* for Catholics, which makes sense given miscarriages are incredibly common, even today.\u00a0 When doctors started using the science of gestation to justify abortion as bad, that's when doctrine changed, but again this was a Catholic thing.\n\n\nEvangelicals, as late as the mid 1970s, had conferences supporting abortion access among religious leaders (Southern Baptist convention).\u00a0 This is where racism starts getting involved.\u00a0 After the civil rights act of 1965, people in the South were getting around segregation by going to \"religious schools\" that were white only.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case Green v. Connolly it ruled that no nonprofit could claim tax exempt status and descriminate on race effectively stopping this practice.\u00a0 This meant no segregated private religious schools unless they were willing to pay a lot in taxes. Side note, this is why Mormons decided black people were okay in 1978, right after green vs connaly was decided and they showed enforcement, Mormons believe an ancient race of white people made all the structures in north America, like cohokia mounds etc, and that bad brown people wiped them out (native Americans), they are both descendants of the lost tribe of isreal and if you pray hard enough you can turn white. But this doesn't explain where black people come from, so they chose to use the curse of ham and curse of Cain to justify blackness as God cursing them for ancient misgivings, hence why they were banned.\u00a0 Mormonism has had a history of rewriting teachings frequently, so removing stuff like this isn't all that odd for them.\n\n\nAnyway after green vs connaly, evangelical leaders were pissed off and wanted to make sure the federal government could never do something like that again.\u00a0 At the same time, Nixonian Republicans were trying to find a way to pivot the Republican party to appeal to Americans.\u00a0 There was a political science hypothesis of this \"moral majority\".\u00a0 If they could find an issue that would bring these otherwise unengaged voters to the polls, that could be beneficial to Republicans.\u00a0 They found that issue to be abortion, and together with racist evangelical leaders, were able to flip the south and other areas using this idea.",

I think it is necessary health care, but I do not glorify it like a minority of people do.\n\nThough I'm not sure I'd say it was \"necessary\". But definitely unfortunate and for her death to mean something, things have to change. \n\nMy issue with these other commenters is that they, for whatever reason, view human life differently depending on their political affiliation. I do not view it this way. Whether you vote for or against abortion, your life is precious. Even if I disagree with you,  your life matters. But that doesn't seem to be the case for some people and it quite frankly disgusts me.\n\n People vote for what they believe to be right, same as me. While I disagree with people that are against abortion, I can understand why they are against abortion. Some of them just don't want potential human life to be thrown away. Some are people incapable of having babies of their own and have to resort to adoption. Some are potential grandparents whose child aborted their potential grand baby. I've heard these people and I understand why they voted how they voted. I can't fault them, I can only disagree. But I understand.",

Now these states have shunned those decisions so they can feel better about themselves by ignoring the consequences & repercussions.\n\n\"She should have kept her legs crossed.\" \"If only she wasn't such a horrible person!\" \"God has a plan!\"  The act still happened and the people of these states helped encourage it. One can close their eyes and cover their ears but the burden is still on their shoulders: They did nothing to help those impacted by poor decisions.\n\nI doubt the Pearly Gates will absolve sins with such weak excuses.",

She would either have to get sick enough for doctors to intervene, or miscarry on her own.\n\n\n\n\n>\u201cPretty consistently, people say, \u2018Until we can be absolutely certain this isn\u2019t a normal pregnancy, we can\u2019t do anything, because it could be alleged that we were doing an abortion,\u2019\u201d Dr. Tony Ogburn, an OB-GYN in San Antonio, told ProPublica.\n\n\n>Eventually, doctors performed a second ultrasound to \u201cconfirm fetal demise\u201d more than two hours after Crain arrived at the hospital. At that point, Crain was unable to sign consent forms due to \u201cextreme pain,\u201d so Fails quickly signed a release to allow her daughter to undergo an \u201cunplanned dilation and curettage\u201d or \u201cunplanned cesarean section.\u201d\n\n\n> However, doctors decided it was now too dangerous to perform the procedure, according to medical records obtained by the outlet. They suspected that she was bleeding internally after developing a dangerous complication of sepsis called disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n\n> Fails recalled her daughter sitting up in the hospital bed as black blood ran from her mouth and nostrils, telling her, \u201cYou\u2019re strong, Nevaeh. God made us strong.\u201d\n\n\n> Crain died hours later in the intensive care unit.\n\n\n> ProPublica reviewed more than 800 pages of Crain\u2019s medical records and consulted with medical experts, who said that if the teen received proper care she might have survived.\n\n\nThey will take the absolute safest option for themselves which is 100% fool proof evidence that the fetus is 100% dead before doing anything. As stated in the video, they waited until there cannot be any argument that there was a chance that fetus is even slightly hanging on to life.\n\n\nYou argue they have enough evidence of fetus demise without a heart beat, the courts have not stated so. They purposefully left it open ended so doctors don't have a clear answer on what is legal at that point.",

There are so many core measures for sepsis   at this point most hospitals have procedures and policies to address it quickly. So either this is one of the most unsafe hospitals in America, or there is another reason for not following established norms in care.

I'm trying to control others, consider this:\n\nI'm not trying to control the fact that a woman got pregnant through unprotected sex. \n\nI'm not trying to control the fact that the woman decided she didn't want to take the morning after pill. \n\nI'm not trying to control the woman's choice to have an abortion when the fetus isn't viable outside the womb.  \n\nI'm not trying to control anything. \n\nI do believe that once there's a chance for the baby to live a normal life (and yes, it happens at 20 weeks), then the mother has had her chance and she needs to stop being selfish and put the baby first. \n\nYour choice doesn't get to kill a baby that can be born and live a normal life. (Which they can at 20 weeks). \n\nThat's the only instance of \"taking away\" a choice I believe in. \n\nWanna get your pregnant friends together and have an abortion party at 10 weeks? Have at it. \n\nRaped? Incest? Or pregnant with a birth defect that won't live or won't be able to function? Abort. \n\nBut right, I'm the bad guy cuz I don't think something that has a chance to live a normal life should be killed. \n\nAnd you liberals are the normal ones, I'm the crazy one?",

That means the fetus must be completely dead even if by that point, the mother is beyond saving, which is what happened here.

If a fetal heartbeat is detected even after a miscarriage has begun then doctor's cannot continue under most of these laws. \n\n\n> I assume the pro-murders like this blur in the distinction between murdering+removing alive baby as compared to removing a dead miscarried baby's corpse\n\nDoctors and lawyers, people far more educated and intelligent than you, have issues with the ambiguity of the laws as written. Obviously your simplistic interpretation of these statutes has been dumbed down on you end but does not accurately represent the nuance of human physiology. \n\n>After all, Texas's health code is pretty clear that removing a miscarried baby isn't an abortion.\n\nAgain, the legal experts disagree but keep being the dumb guy online making shit up. [In this particular instance, Nevaeh Crain was diagnoised with sepsis but her fetus had a heartbeat.](https://www.propublica.org/article/nevaeh-crain-death-texas-abortion-ban-emtala) Even after she was nearly on death's door the obstetrician had to do multiple ultrasounds because, again, a miscarriage does not rule out a fetal heartbeat. Clearly you have no idea what you are talking about.\n\n>Exodus 20:13 You shall not murder.\n\nLol when I said: \"I can guarantee that it will be an unrelated quote taken out of context that you are trying to force to align with your political beliefs.\" I meant it. Literally the next chapter of Exodus (21:22) outlines that a fine should be paid if someone causes a woman to miscarry. This is massively different than the explicit prescription that \"Death is the punishment for murder\" (Exodus 21:12). Of course, people who are actually familiar with the Bible know these things and people who study ancient Judaism also know [that they considered first breath to be when life begins.](https://www.thetorah.com/article/the-bible-is-silent-on-abortion-but-vocal-about-when-life-begins)  \n\nThe sad part is, if you were able to break out of your brainwashing and think critically you might start to wonder why the Bible says nothing explicitly about abortion. Surely an all-knowing God would clarify he stance on such an important issue, he certainly wastes no ink on all kinds of inane rules and regulations. You need to realize you know very little about these subjects before you spout off about them again.",

Maybe you could do your own study?\n\nIf what you say about the laws being vague is so, perhaps you should lobby for clearer laws. But I don't buy it anyway; as I understand, the first hospital (despite obvious signs, missed by people much smarter than me) allegedly didn't detect the infection, and the second \"screened positive\" for sepsis, but still let her go. So much for being diagnosed. This bit is particularly remarkable; insight offered by people smarter than me:  \n\n\n>  \nProPublica condensed more than 800 pages of Crain\u2019s medical records into a four-page timeline in consultation with two maternal-fetal medicine specialists; reporters **reviewed it with nine doctors, including researchers at prestigious universities**, OB-GYNs who regularly handle miscarriages, and experts in emergency medicine and maternal health. \n\n>Some said the first ER missed warning signs of infection that deserved attention. All said that the doctor at the second **hospital should never have sent Crain home** when her signs of sepsis hadn\u2019t improved. And when she returned for the third time, **all said there was no medical reason to make her wait for two ultrasounds before taking aggressive action to save her.**\n\n  \nThe third hospital didn't detect a fetal heartbeat, yet still didn't rush her to delivery. The article you list literally says the baby didn't have a heartbeat. And it wasn't even that they thought there was a heartbeat; it's that the ultrasound they did earlier didn't record the lack of a heartbeat, so they felt (despite the emergency, for which there are apparently exceptions), they needed to do another ultrasound with recording capabilities. Far and away, this is beyond any conceived inhibitions over a heartbeat (for which there are apparently emergency exceptions), which this article doesn't seem to conclusively suppose was present at any of the 3 hospitals.  \n  \n  \nIt's funny that you don't understand the verse you quote while telling me that I don't understand (which is fair, there are many things that I don't).   \nIn the verse you quoted, the hebrew word, yatsa (3318 in Strong's lexicon), just means 'to come out', and offers offers no distinction in whether it's referring to a premature birth or a miscarriage. This verse supposes the fine is given under the requisite that there is no further injury. Meaning, if there is no injury beyond the baby coming out, a fine is to be determined by her husband. Besides this, *given the context of the very next verse***,** I think with your superior intellect you can extrapolate that the following...:  \n  \n\"But **if a serious injury results**, then you must require **a life for a life**\u2014 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, and stripe for stripe.\"  \n  \n... means that it's safe to assume yatsa, in this context, means premature birth, under the requisite that there is no serious injury. Otherwise, it makes no sense to suppose the offender must pay a fee if the baby is killed, but if the baby is killed, a life must be given for a life.",

In fact, an meta-analysis of these studies has pointed out that if you account for religious affiliation, that difference effectively disappears.

The second and third visit would go entirely differently in a state where the laws aligned with medical best practice. The reason these doctors were not just aborting the fetus was because the law clearly states that providing an abortion if the fetus is alive can result in up to ninety nine years in prison and a loss of their medical license. \n\n> they needed to do another ultrasound with recording capabilities. \n\nLet's put on our thinking caps and wonder why that might be... maybe because the consequences of lack of evidence in this instance could be devastating. The backward politicians that pushed these laws were warned about these exact issues when they passed these draconian punishments with ambiguous exceptions, this is on them.\n\n>In the verse you quoted, the hebrew word, yatsa (3318 in Strong's lexicon), just means 'to come out', and offers offers no distinction in whether it's referring to a premature birth or a miscarriage. \n\nMy other link was a Hebrew scholar that already clarified this passage.

You ignored the breathe of life because you know you are full of shit. You ignored the obvious 'life' in question here is the pregnant woman (a common conservative 'mistake'), and you ignored my point about all-knowing deity not clarifying such a supposedly important subject. From that same link:\n\n\"It is noteworthy, however, that the Bible does not clearly condemn abortion; it simply does not rule on it. It does, however, unequivocally demonstrate, within its own cultural constructions, that a woman\u2019s life was considered to have more value than that of an unborn fetus, and that life begins at first breath.\"\n\nThe dumb part of all of this is that abortion was not an issue for most protestant sects until Republicans realized they could use it as a wedge issue against women's liberation.

I have taken Biblical history classes, I have read historical scholarship on these subjects, you are just so brainwashed you don't know how blind you are.

There are two distinct creation accounts in Genesis. [Genesis 1 is derived from the \"Priestly Source\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestly_source) which is a version of the early Pentateuch that is was a distinct collection of writings that can be found woven throughout the Old Testament. This is account with creation listed as days that mostly people are familiar with. [Genesis 2 is actually the Jahwist account (technically it starts at 2:4b), a distinct set of writing that was later tacked on to the Priestly account.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahwist). In this version, man was created before plants.\n\nThe sad part about this is that this obvious contradiction was sitting in front of Christians from the very start. Biblical scholars and pastors are more than aware of the differences between the Priestly and Jahwist accounts but you were never taught about them because it blows a hole in the bullshit assertion of Biblical inerrancy. \n\n>What was the definition of murder in the 70s compared to today?\n\nOk, so I was dunking on you for being unaware earlier but you do know culture and languages change over time, right? Our culture and our language have changed a fair bit since the 1970s but surely you are aware that 2600-2800 years ago is exponentially longer than that? \n\n>When God's Word is believed as the truth, what's the point in humoring cultural points and fallible 'Hebrew scholars'?\n\n This exact same thing could be said about the Book of Mormon, the Quran, and Dianetics. It is a way for the believer to insulate themselves from discovering the truth. If you dedicate your life to something, why wouldn't you want to know more about it? \n\n\n>You don't seem to believe God's Word anyway, so why try to use something you don't believe in or agree with to change my mind?\n\nBecause even if you are basing your life off of a mythology you don't understand, you and people like you are intent on fucking everything else up for the sober secular people around you. If you were fine playing make-believe and leaving everyone else alone (like Wiccans or Jain), I wouldn't have to do this. \n\n>Why do you care about maintaining the legal ability to murder babies? \n\n[Sane people don't confuse this with a baby.](https://www.fao.org/4/t0117e/T0117E23.jpg) You are in a cult, it might be big and some sects might be old but you have signed over your higher thinking to a mythology that doesn't allow you to operate in reality.\n\n>If we know something is wrong, it doesn't mean we need to try to hide from God \n\nIf God thought it was wrong, presumably it would be very clearly outlined in his documents. He wasted no ink on genealogies, ancient poetry, and the painful details of Leviticus but magically you have to twist yourself into knots try to reinterpret a passage to apply to something that it simply didn't. \n\n\n>or deny that He's real, sovereign, and provident.\n\nThere is as much evidence for your deity as there is for any other. I know you didn't bother to watch that link I provided but if you did, you would find two Biblical scholars discussing the origins and creation of the Hebrew Yaweh from a regional Canaanite storm god.

Sure we can say that those processes should've happened swifter and a different outcome may have resulted, but this is America, land of liability, where every tragedy leads to a lawsuit, and so decisions can't be made quickly, especially under a state with draconian laws. A doctor's career is on the line, as is the hospital's funding, so attorneys need to get involved. Everything doesn't happen at the same speed as an episode of House. Had they removed the fetus with an earlier determination of being unviable, mom survives, then hospital gets sued because maybe their determination of unviable was flawed. Hence they waited to confirm fetal demise.  We have a tower of bad laws intersecting that led to this outcome.  \n\nAll that said, I can't help but think that mom would still be alive, and maybe the baby too, if they had been living in Southern California, and not Texas.",

As soon as that was confirmed, they were unhindered by the ridiculous state laws. But frankly I am not a medical professional so I don't know why they didn't intervene before confirming fetus demise. I agree that by my layman understanding, the act of experiencing a miscarriage should be sufficient, but the doctors, hospital, and presumably legal department, felt otherwise. I believe if they were in a state without the typical red state \"life of fetus above all else including pregnant mom\" law, medical intervention would've occurred earlier.",

Are you?\n\nI appreciate you telling me that her life was at risk the night before. I believe at that point when she was in the company of highly-trained and experienced medical professionals, and they considered her not sick enough for them to be legally-cleared to intervene. Its kinda right there in the article. That's why I stated she should've been admitted rather than sent home. So as soon as she reached the appropriate point, in their determination, they could intervene as soon as possible and limit further harm and risk. \n\nPretty sure our views actually are aligned there. In fact we probably agree they should've intervened earlier, but your focus is purely on the lives involved and we can't do that here because this is America, particularly Texas, and not the UK or almost any other country with a non-privatized health care system and lesser-litigious society in the world. \n\n> The obvious parallel is \"if mom doesn't survive, then hospital doesn't get sued because maybe their determination of unviable was not flawed.\"\n> That's disgusting.\n\nNot at all. If mom doesn't survive, then the teen's mom sues the hospital. Predictable, and is what said teen's mom is actively attempting. So yes, the hospital knew it likely would have a lawsuit on its hands either way, and so instead of focusing on saving one or two lives, they opted to save the hospital (or at least its profit margin), and ensure they were within all applicable laws. \n\nYou seem determined to consider my views disgusting, so lets just cement that in the register so you can move on. I'm sure I have a disgusting view somewhere worthy of your dismay. :D   What is actually disgusting is US health care, and the fact that US medical professionals have to consider dollars before lives, if they want a long career. That is what is disgusting. I'm merely aware of it.",

Or, maybe I've just seen it so many times that I'm not surprised by it. This isn't new. There are over 100 instances of delayed care in the absence of fetal death. Rates of sepsis has tripled in Texas. Over 100 doctors wrote to the State Legislature demanding a change so that they can confidently provide care. The teen here isn't the latest. Josseli Barnica suffered near the exact same situation.\n\n> https://www.propublica.org/article/josseli-barnica-death-miscarriage-texas-abortion-ban\n\nIt is easy to blame the doctors/hospital here, since they didn't put life above legal liability, but they aren't alone:\n\n> \nIn response to their stories, 111 doctors wrote a letter to the Legislature saying the abortion ban kept them from providing lifesaving care and demanding a change.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s black and white in the law, but it\u2019s very vague when you\u2019re in the moment,\u201d said Dr. Tony Ogburn, an OB-GYN in San Antonio. When the fetus has a heartbeat, doctors can\u2019t simply follow the usual evidence-based guidelines, he said. Instead, there is a legal obligation to assess whether a woman\u2019s condition is dire enough to merit an abortion under a prosecutor\u2019s interpretation of the law.\n\nSource: https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/20/texas-abortion-ban-impact-death-hospitalization\n\nSo why  does everyone keep focusing on fetal heartbeat? Because it provides the certainty doctors need to act in an environment where every action can result in loss of license, imprisonment, and lawsuits:\n\n> While undefined, it is generally understood that in the context of Texas\u2019s definition of abortion, \u201cdead\u201d means that there is no cardiac activity present in the embryo or fetus. This means that treatment for ectopic pregnancy (including use of methotrexate and surgical removal) and **treatment for miscarriage where there is no cardiac activity** (including medications, D&C, D&E, labor induction) **are not abortions** under Texas law and are thus permitted in Texas.\n\nSource: https://abortiondefensenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Texas_ADN-Know-Your-State_Feb-2024.pdf\n\n*\"Know Your State's Abortion Laws\" - Abortion Defense Network, January 2024*\n\n> They were cowards for waiting. \n\nOkay, then it appears that a large number of Texas doctors are cowards. Per ProPublica, who really have been heading reporting on this issue, clearly:\n\n> Our analysis showed that patients who were admitted while their fetus was still believed to have a heartbeat were far more likely to develop sepsis.\n\nThus, women should avoid getting pregnant in Texas. Or, if getting pregnant in Texas, come live in California until the baby is born at least, for safety. Because Texas is no longer safe for pregnant women. If women start living by those statement, you will see the laws change quickly. \n\n> They waited because of garbage conservative laws, not because it was medically appropriate.\n\nWe agree.",

Because the alternative is a dictatorship which decides healthcare policy.  That's great, I guess, if it's a dictator you like and agree with, but the nature of dictators is that you usually don't get to pick them (or replace them if they're no longer good rulers).\n\nLike it or not, healthcare will always be political, because it's part of public policy.  The people of Texas are getting exactly what they voted for here.  If the healthcare policy of Texas is bad, it's up to the people of Texas to vote for better leaders to enact better policy.  I don't see that happening any time soon, if ever.",

It should be a personal experience that *you* live by, not what you make others live by. Religion should not be in schools or in government. But organized religion is how you maintain control over the cult. The Bible is their playbook. \n\nNo one has ever read the legitimate Bible. It's had pieces removed, destroyed, added, and translated through each Era by A human man with an agenda for the time period. The Bible was only meant to be a guide, take the morals leave the rest. Aka -like love your neighbor, be a good person.  But they don't do that, they cling to the parts that were added. This is organized religion gets their followers to bend to their will. \"God chose the president. \" No he didn't. They did. And if you go against them, it means you go to Hell. For all eternity. Its gross. \n\nPeople need to think for themselves and make their religion a personal one. But until someone actually does anything, they will continue this path.  They need to be stopped.

I guess it still isn't clear to some people, so I'll try to state it as clearly as I can: Conservatives were conservative before they started watching Fox News, listening to their pastors, and so forth. Conservatives listen to things like Fox News because Fox News echoes their views. Just look at the way conservative media these days grasps around for an angle whenever Trump does something stupid, until they find the angle that resonates with their conservative audience. The audience is shaping the media; the media is just reflecting what the audience wants to hear.\n\nSo I'll say something I feel really needs to be said: this idea that if conservatives would just think for themselves or make their religion a personal one will not solve the problem. It isn't even relevant to the problem. Said idea is just paternalistic and condescending nonsense that obfuscates the very real fact that conservatives are thinking for themselves, are not sheep, and have reached the place they've reached through reflection and thought (however flawed) about the world.",

Even when it helps people, it's by defining an in group which leads directly to fascistic tendencies. Individual good done by some churches people or organisations (and even then organisations often have restrictions that discriminates against different people they're \"helping\") does not hold a candle to the horrors it has generated.\n\nEven people who were hailed as helpers and making a difference like Teresa and Pierre are shown to be monsters propped up by the structure of religion. Religion enables molesters by pushing the idea that you should trust your fellows, once again in-group shit, same thing with overvaluing family which helps abusers. It also makes the life of anyone who doesn't fit in in heavily religious area, an absolute hell.\n\nThe social practice of faith has repeatedly shown throughout History that it will cause much more evil than it ever cause good. Faith is fine, grafting social structures onto it has always turned out evil after reaching a certain size.",

Keep that shit to yourself if I make it clear I want none of that in my life, regardless of what it is.\n\nReligion harms much more than it does good IMO, religion seriously harmed the relationship I have with my parents because they tried to force their fairytales onto me. In the middle east people still get beheaded over transgressions that only still exist due to certain holy books, look at fucking Afghanistan for the best example, it makes me seethe to see what stupid laws they have there. People still get killed over the \u2018holy land\u2019 of Palestine or Israel. In a census in 1939 95% of Germans claimed to be good loving christians and christianity was embraced and twisted by the nazi party to further gain support and expand their political agenda, and now the US does the exact same thing just with a different end goal.\n\nYes religion can be a good thing, when we take their core values that should be common sense and strip away all the extremism, holy wars, capital punishment, the sexism towards women, should I go on? Every major religion found in western countries still has some sort of these extremist views written in their holy books(obviously allot of people don\u2019t practice them), which can still be exploited by bad actors.\n\nReligion is so easy to misuse, their texts to easy to misinterpret or just straight up at odds with modern western values. People should be free to choose their own religion, and schools and politics should be free of any religion, only focussing on the betterment of humanity in a morally correct way equal to anyone. But hey, one can dream of utopia right? \n\nReligion should be personal, you and only you are in your own head. If you can\u2019t cope with everything just going black when you die, sure go find a religion to join. But in the west we have western values, and people have the freedom to choose what they want. When religion gets put in politics and schools some people no longer get that choice, and we are already seeing that it has dire consequences for some in the USA.\n\nEducation and government should be secularised, you have your prayer houses to go to if you wanna pray, build a community or learn about your holy books/god(s)(just visit more often if you want more religious education!), you have freedom to religiously express yourself, if that isn\u2019t enough I don\u2019t know what is.",

I do think it's fair to say that she should have been hospitalized after the second visit. That lack of hospitalization may well be a result of the abortion laws as well. One concern that's been raised is that medical centers will try to \"hot potato\" a pregnant patient so they don't have to assume the legal risk. I've seen this with my daughter and her heart condition. The moment a medical center thinks there is a potential liability, they will devise an excuse to pass the patient off to anyone else. That's a pretty reasonable explanation for why she was sent away from the second visit despite knowing she had sepsis.  \n\nThe doctor refusing to abort until they had two ultrasounds is not something that can be ignored. Given the state of the patient described in the article, they should have been ready to abort no matter what. She was dying. There's no way to tell if she would have died anyhow, but with something like sepsis, time is important, and Texas abortion laws caused the delay.",

It sounds like there were both misdiagnoses delaying treatment combined with the fear of criminal charges which discouraged action. You\u2019re right, they never should have sent her home the second time as she tested positive for sepsis. They wasted a lot of time testing for fetal heartbeat the third time as well. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty crazy that Texas has pushed the idea that the abortion ban, which prevents doctors from any intervention that ends fetal heartbeat, supersedes the federal law to provide lifesaving care. Seems like doctors are worried more about legal consequences (up to 99 years in prison) than saving lives.",

I did some light skimming across other articles and it sounds like an 18 year old who 6 months pregnant presents with multiple visits to the ER. First, she is diagnosed with strep throat which is treated with antibiotics but apparently they didn\u2019t identify the UTI. The second visit she is diagnosed with UTI and again she is sent home with antibiotics. Finally she goes to the hospital and is diagnosed with sepsis which lead to her miscarriage and untimely death. To me, this doesn\u2019t read as an abortion issue. Did the patient take her full antibiotics doses as directed and in a timely fashion? Did the patient present with symptoms related to UTI that was overlooked? Would delivering the baby preterm have saved the mom if she was already septic? Honestly this case is unfortunate because it sounds like the mom and baby\u2019s lives could have both been saved if appropriate diagnosis and treatment were followed through. It\u2019s very unfortunate that her hormones escalated these complications very quickly. Such a tough case. \ud83d\ude1e",

This woman died because of the delays caused by the doctors documenting medical need as required under the anti-abortion law. \n\nShe was already having a miscarriage when she presented at the hospital the first time. That was the cause of sepsis, which was misdiagnosed as strep. Pregnant women are receiving terrible care because doctors don\u2019t want to risk their freedom by intervening. They hot potato patients rather than treat them. \n\nOn the third hospital visit, they diagnosed sepsis, confirmed lack of a fetal heartbeat, but waited another 2.5 hours to get a bedside ultrasound to provide a record of fetal demise. Once they did, they decided it was too late to operate and she died. She should been in the OR as soon as she got to the hospital. The u/s was medically unnecessary and was only done as a CYA for the doctors because of the anti-abortion law. \n\nNow you might think, well it\u2019s the doctor\u2019s fault for CYA rather than treat. The TX AG recently threatened to prosecute a doctor in Dallas for performing an emergency abortion due to a miscarriage because the AG doesn\u2019t think the doctor adequately documented that the emergency was actually an emergency. The doctor\u2019s word isn\u2019t enough. They have to provide documentation that an anti-abortion lawyer agrees with.

The doctor can request a legal medicine consult and if they are not a gyno, request a gyn consult too. That way everything is documented and they are in the clear regarding if it was a life treating event or not. \nand lets assume it wasn't a life threatening event yet, there is no world where the doctor is in the right for discharging a pregnant woman like that. Maybe if she requested that, but even then it is iffy. \nThe story reads to me as a lazy doctor trying to get away from their work, but more details could come up later. What was done to her is a lot more common that you think. Many doctors/ nurses will send patients away if there is no strict policy or personal incentives. At our public hospital in another country they have sent countless patients with emergencies away because they don't want more patients. It is a game of hot potato, send the patient away and hope another hospital accepts them, sometimes nasty tactics are uses like making the patient think the care they will get will be bad and they need a private hospital for their problem. \nWhat I am trying to say is the doctor should be investigated, even if they never intended to terminate her pregnancy, they just have at least admitted her to the ER or a ward to monitor her vital signs and labs and see if she is getting progressively worse.",

            "body": "That\u2019s not quite true:\n\nNevaeh Crain, an 18-year-old from Texas, died on October 29, 2023, during a miscarriage after seeking medical care across three emergency room visits within 20 hours. The details surrounding her death reveal a complex situation involving medical decisions, potential negligence, and the influence of Texas\u2019 abortion laws, though the exact cause and whether her death was preventable remain subjects of debate.\nNevaeh was six months pregnant when she began experiencing severe symptoms on October 28, 2023, the day of her baby shower. She woke up with a headache, followed by fever, nausea, vomiting, and sharp abdominal pain. Her first visit to Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas resulted in a diagnosis of strep throat, with no investigation into her abdominal cramps despite her pregnancy. She was sent home with antibiotics. Her condition worsened overnight, and she returned to a second hospital, Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth, where medical records show she screened positive for sepsis\u2014a life-threatening infection response. However, doctors noted her fetus still had a heartbeat and discharged her after treatment with IV fluids, antibiotics, and Tylenol, deeming her stable enough to leave despite persistent fever and an elevated fetal heart rate.\nBy the morning of October 29, Nevaeh was too weak to walk, with blood staining her thighs, indicating a likely miscarriage. At her third ER visit, back at Christus St. Elizabeth, she was in extreme pain and unable to sign consent forms. Her mother, Candace Fails, authorized potential procedures like a dilation and curettage or cesarean section. An obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to \u201cconfirm fetal demise\u201d before transferring her to the ICU, a process that delayed care by over two hours. By then, her blood pressure had crashed, her lips were \u201cblue and dusky,\u201d and she showed signs of organ failure. Doctors suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe sepsis complication causing internal bleeding, and deemed surgery too risky. Shortly after, Nevaeh died in the ICU, with black blood gushing from her nose and mouth. The medical examiner later removed her fetus, Lillian, and classified her death as \u201cnatural\u201d due to \u201ccomplications of pregnancy,\u201d noting she had been \u201crepeatedly seeking medical care for a progressive illness.\u201d\nExperts consulted by ProPublica, who reviewed her case, indicated that earlier admission and continuous treatment might have saved Nevaeh and possibly her fetus. They criticized the initial discharges and the delay for two ultrasounds, suggesting no medical necessity for such a wait given her sepsis symptoms. However, they couldn\u2019t definitively say her death was preventable based on available records. Texas\u2019 abortion ban, which prohibits interventions ending a fetal heartbeat unless the mother\u2019s life is clearly at risk, likely influenced the cautious approach. The law\u2019s ambiguity has led to fears of legal repercussions among doctors, potentially delaying critical care in pregnancy emergencies. Some argue this hesitation turned Nevaeh into an \u201cuntouchable\u201d patient, as providers avoided procedures that could be misconstrued as abortions while a heartbeat was detectable.\nNevaeh\u2019s family, who are pro-life and say she wanted her baby, alleges medical negligence by the hospitals, not the abortion law, caused her death. They claim Baptist and St. Elizabeth failed to act urgently, missing signs of sepsis and miscarriage. Candace Fails has expressed frustration that her daughter\u2019s case is being politicized rather than focusing on hospital accountability. No legal action has progressed, as Texas law sets a high bar\u2014\u201cwillful and wanton negligence\u201d\u2014for ER-related malpractice claims, deterring lawyers from taking the case.\nThe truth of Nevaeh Crain\u2019s death lies at the intersection of a rapidly worsening infection, delayed medical intervention, and a legal environment that may have paralyzed timely care. Sepsis, likely from her miscarriage, killed her, but whether earlier action could have changed the outcome remains uncertain. Her story reflects both individual tragedy and broader systemic tensions, with no single narrative fully resolving the question of blame.",

Is it not standard in the US that if you\u2019re pregnant and sick they don\u2019t monitor the baby? Fetal heartbeat monitor should have been strapped on immediately. Why wouldn\u2019t the dr not check the abdominal pain when she\u2019s 6 months pregnant?! The hospital was negligent right there, especially if they\u2019re supposed to be so \u201cpro life\u201d. \n\nThe second visit where she has a bonkers fever, clear signs of sepsis and they release her home? You can\u2019t mess around with sepsis, pregnant or not. That should have been an instant admission right there. No monitoring of the baby to see if it was in distress? Couldn\u2019t they have monitored, if distress emergency c section? I can\u2019t imagine that the baby wasn\u2019t in distress and that the teen wasn\u2019t already in preterm labour long before that. \n\nThat is horrific medical care. If any American accepts this level of negligence is absolutely beyond comprehension. If this had been a non-pregnant 18 yo, still negligent. The seeming lack of prenatal care during these visits is even more disturbing. Why no fetal heartbeat monitoring during this whole ordeal? That would give the proof right there - no waiting needed.",

I'm nearly certain it will swing again in the other direction, and who knows, maybe murder outside the womb will be accepted as ok. It's already been talked about. Ridiculous.",

I'll leave the composition of that review board and which way they lean on those decisions as an exercise to the reader.\u00a0\n\n* The Texas supreme Court rejected requests by doctors and medical organizations to clarify the rules.\u00a0\n\n\ntl;dr; Any doctor performing an abortion in Texas, regardless of necessity or age of the fetus, risks having their entire life destroyed. Any hospital that allows it risks losing millions in litigation. If you say that win't result in delayed care leading to harm and death of pregnant women you're a liar, a fool or both.",

She developed cramping and pain and bleeding and was diagnosed with sepsis, which is life-threatening. However, because her fetus still had a heartbeat, doctors couldn\u2019t treat her. After several hours, she suffered a miscarriage, and, only after confirming her fetus no longer had a heartbeat, did they admit her into the ICU, but it was too late to save her and she died.",
