You tell him to fuck off, and he gets rowdy cause he's drunk and has a massive ego problem.\n\n\nNormally this would just end up in a shoving match, or maybe the cops would get called or something.\n\n\nBut in Mexico, if that guy is in a cartel, he might just call his buddies up and track you all down to get his revenge.",

They\u2019d start fights, get their asses beat, then leave only to show back up a few hours later with more people to shoot the place up. Happened about 5 separate times in 2 years. The cartel guys were the only ones like this. All the American gang dudes preferred to just fight.",

I'm the calm friend (cool aunt?) who is going to take your hand and tell you everything is going to be ok. \n\nMy c-section baby is in college, but I am a crazy mad researcher with adhd, so afterwards, I did a ton of research to understand what all happened. \n\nAbesthrologists are angels. Epidurals can be a lot less scary than you think. Mine was *weird* but not really painful. The anestheoligist will explain everything, and sit by your head. Mine narrated, like \"you may feel this sensation or that, but it won't be painful.\" You will think you are dying the instant they say, \"ok, time to get up\" the first time after surgery. You're going to be OK. Trust your nurses. Have an advocate (partner, mom, MIL, doula) who will know what you want, and help ask questions & support you.\n\nCaveat about trusting your nurses: it is always your right to remove any care provider from your health care team. If you happen to get the odd nurse, doctor, whomever, that you do not like/want/trust/vibe with. \n\nYou got this.\n\nOh, yeah, they do inspect your innards before closing you up, but they're just making sure that there are no fun surprises like a fibroid or anything that looks amiss. Human intestines have a cool feature that let's them sort if un-jumble themselves. While weird feeling, it isn't painful, and you for sure don't have to see it if you don't want to. (I'm a weirdo and watched the video of mine, you do you.)\n\nYou will not die the first time you poop afterwards.\n\nSorry if that's TMI, but also DM if you need encouragement",

They returned at close with another 2 guys. I went and talked to them saying it\u2019s not worth it. They pulled out of the parking lot to across the street, I was watching them with another security guard and 2 armed customers, they flipped their headlights off, and started blasting lol couple ar15\u2019s chambered in .22 and a couple pump shotguns with birdshot luckily. The shot to my face was from the ar15 and the one in my arm was birdshot. All 4 of us had multiple gunshot wounds but only one guy was critical. He got a birdshot pellet through his esophagus but ended up pulling through. The detectives know who the guys were but said they all went back to Mexico immediately.",

How do you think the Cartel continues to have such influence in American cities? They have people who are either apart of the Cartel or work very closely with it, and could probably flee to them if need be.\n\n2. Left\u2019s complete dismissal and open borders policy is literally propaganda from right wing media. If you cared enough to do your own research, you\u2019d know that BIDEN DEPORTED MORE PEOPLE THAN TRUMP (comparing both of their first terms on office). You also know that Trump\u2019s current deportation rate (from J2025 to March 2025) is SLOWER than Biden\u2019s was at the same time (from J2021- March 2021).

Biden had 100x more border encounters than Trump, because many more were heading here because of news they would be able to get in and stay. 1% of 1 million is a worse record than 10% of 100k even if they\u2019re both the same # of deportations. The biggest effect is in the marketing of \u201cfuck off\u201d to illegal migrants, which is more effective than the confused discourse of democrats welcoming them across open borders while the same border patrol agents do their jobs- highly unlikely that border patrol is left-leaning ;)\n\nJust like with gun control, the stats chosen by the left are only those suitable for propaganda.

Partially explains the prevalence of anxiety and panic attacks in those individuals as well.\n\nSo we tend to be calm in difficult situations because we kind of live nextdoor to/in fight or flight anyways. It's just another day in our anxious, emotionally jumbled mind.\n\nI've heard various psychologists allude to this but can't find any studies at the moment so grain of salt but it's a common sentiment among those that have it.",

The chicks after getting beat 4 vs 1 were so salty they left sent one girl to sneak in like 30 minutes later and busted a pool ball over the back of the poor girls head sitting at the front bar. Pathetic, knocked her out cold busted the back of her head open had to call ambulance blood was everywhere. Quit bartending after that. Like just take the L and move on especially when you started it in the first place and lost 4 vs 1.",

Little did I know that those tend to attract people who have money for the *wrong* reasons. Anyway, me and my friend are waiting to go to the toilet and there are two men talking in a stall. We were way too innocent then so had no idea what that meant. I started banging on the door, a little drunk, and said \u2018you guys can stop making out in there! We need to piss!\u2019 The door swings open, and suddenly there are two huge hulking guys in leather jackets with motorcycle gang logos on them - 1%ers - and coke is all over the top of the toilet. I felt shivers down my spine, my body went rigid, my face went red. They started laughing along which defused the tension a bit, but I fully expected a hurricane of fists to start hitting my face at any moment. They asked if we wanted some coke, I shook my head saying no and stammering, so they said if we changed our mind we could find them around the bar. I was surprised at how chill they were but I feel it\u2019s a confrontation that could have went either way.\n\nAll it takes is a dumb fucking moment like that on someone with a smaller ego or who has had a bad night. They have a rule in gangs, too: one guy is hitting someone, everyone else joins in. I also often wondered why so many people do something as disturbing as dismembering a corpse, but it\u2019s likely their way of making it easier to conceal, disgustingly enough. They likely beat these people up, realise they\u2019re not breathing anymore, then try to make them as hard to find as possible. Depressing to think about.",

Or guys will hang out in tourist areas making new friends and luring them to another location (presumably to continue partying) where guys are waiting to beat and rob them. \n\nAbduction for extortion/ransom is not an uncommon tactic in general and its possible this was a coordinated scheme to pick up tourists in a specific area, get what they want from them, and in this case kill them after.",

There might be some big operations that the boss personally takes an interest in to make sure things are running right but those at the bottom have to invent their own schemes or find new business. That is why in developed countries, crime doesn't really pay because you have to kick up so much money, you'd be better off just working a regular 9-5.

When my dealers were out I'd walk across the border to find some H with my ex who was a pretty big guy, didn't look like someone you'd want to mess with. We found someone and did the deal, and were on our way to the shitty tiny room in a \"motel\" with nothing but a mattress and a dirt floor with \"pretty, sad girl\" written on the wall in some kind of red substance that we rented for $5 to get well before heading back across the border when we got stopped by a few guys who demanded to know if the person we were interacting with sold to us. We obviously acted like we didn't understand, said we were asking for directions, I was TERRIFIED, then the same dude pops up around the corner. As soon as he sees these dudes he tries to bolt, and they left us alone to chase him down. What I could make out from the Spanish I knew was that dude was selling in their territory. I looked back once while getting tf outta there and the guys who confronted us were forcing him into a car. \n\nSometimes I think about what might have happened to him. But yeah, very territorial",

I googled around to find out why it was happening, then found some interesting forums where people were speculating it was due to contaminants and pesticides in the soil. Then, out of nowhere, it got really fucking weird and there were replies claiming either the government was purposely poisoning the animals intentionally to make people afraid to use them (they\u2019re only used by some super esoteric tribe anyway) or that animals don\u2019t have the religious capability of humans so they were overwhelmed by the experience, suddenly grew sapient, and died from brain overload. Lots of people were agreeing and another guy in the thread was using a ton of scientific terminology - accurately, as I have some background in science at both undergraduate and postgrad level - but also cherry picking so it was total nonsense. I\u2019m guessing they were a Ph.D who fried their brain.",

I think Mexican Spanish is a good one to learn and it\u2019s a great country with great people in a lot of cool places. That being said, I\u2019ve had good experiences in Mazatlan, Cozumel, Puerto Vallarta - contradictory to my cunty earlier comment, these are all somewhat touristy places (not a bad thing). \n\nI visited them all multiple times while working on cruise ships. They\u2019re all not nearly the same level of \u201cresort oriented\u201d as Cabo San Lucas or Cancun. But it\u2019s been 2 years at least since I\u2019ve been to any of those three spots so I am not sure if they are still relatively safe. \n\nAlthough really what you\u2019ve gotta do is go alone and stay where the locals live. I don\u2019t want to recommend a bunch of people go live more cheaply in the part of town where locals live and price out Mexicans but you can find responsible ways to rent a place for a month in the town\u2019s relative \u201ccentro\u201d. Airbnb is arguably worse than working with a local short term property rental company or independent homeowner but they do have really good deals for (1+) month long rentals. If you\u2019re gonna go that route message the host, offer to pay and work with them off of the platform. Obviously this is riskier for both parties so read out the situation thoroughly and understand what you\u2019d be setting up. But without Airbnb in the picture the host can discount the rate substantially for you and still make money themselves. To be honest, even though I\u2019ve done this I can\u2019t safely recommend it. But having a local host you in some regard is hugely helpful for learning not only the language but the customs of their part of the country.\n\nI had a host in Oaxaca de Juarez for 2 months that became like an older brother to me. He was a professor at the University near Zocalo and spoke no English. He mostly lived in the unit right under me so we would speak frequently about any number of things. He would take me out to watch a soccer game and have a beer at a bar in the Zocalo plaza. I would return the favor by buying us lunch at a place of his recommendation. He taught me in Spanish; through brute force, charades, google translate and cognates; about the politics of Mexico and the state of Oaxaca in depth. That\u2019s how you cut your teeth. \n\nYou\u2019ve got to be humble, able to laugh at yourself with the others who will be laughing at you, and committed. Everyday you go out you know you\u2019re alone and can\u2019t count on anyone around you speaking any English. Your phones translate won\u2019t always work. Sometimes you will be unable to get a message through to another person and you will simply have to give up on whatever query or necessity you may have had in talking with that person. It\u2019s exhausting but it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun once you get some wind in your sails. \n\nI\u2019m dragging this but - hostels are a double edged sword. It is a good way to not price out locals and responsibly bring in your money but you might be around a bunch of Brits and Aussies instead of people who speak Spanish. And it\u2019ll change everyday who is there. I find that I like to go to hostels after a while of being in a state of lingual isolation. And when I\u2019m lucky, the group I link into at the hostel is hugely multicultural. Some of the most helpful and fun language lessons I\u2019ve had have been drinking beer / wine and making dinner with a group of French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chilean and Italians. For that example in particular, we spoke a kind of 5 language Patois. Made for the most interesting and versatile conversation dynamic I\u2019ve ever experienced, especially because we\u2019d spent the day together hiking in Costa Rica. It felt like I could literally feel neural connections forming in the Wernicke\u2019s Area of my brain (language spot). I always found it hard to sleep after days like that because it\u2019s so stimulating to think and communicate and hear and mentally translate in so many similar languages at once.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a rare hostel experience but as an English only (presumably) speaker - you will have to be really warm, friendly, vulnerable and maybe even at first funny / charismatic. They\u2019ll likely understand you for the most part but they can probably also speak amongst each other in 2+ non English languages in many cases. And they will. Especially the French lol they will gather amongst fellow Francophones and just smoke and yap with no English for hours. It\u2019s hilarious to me because they know it\u2019s rude in a sense but generally if you talk to them they will actually be friendly and welcoming, they\u2019ll just also let you sit there without understanding for hours if you choose to stay and sit hahahaha.\n\nThanks for prompting me to write that I enjoyed reflecting on the past couple years of my experience doing what it sounds like you plan to.

So you can do the same.\n\nIt's not being pedantic when the terms have different meanings. \n\nBesides the point, the countries report differently anyway, so you're kind of comparing apples and oranges. \n\nMissing persons in both countries, are any persons reported missing. In this case the US figures per capita are much much higher. - Which could simply be people being more likely to report people missing sooner, or it could just mean more unhappy kids and family members fucking off for a while without telling anyone. Who knows... Its not really a useful statistic to compare. \n\nIn M\u00e9xico dissappeared persons are those who are both missing and presumed possibly taken, while in the US the closest to this is an abduction, however the US does not class someone as abducted unless there is clear and compelling evidence to show this is the case.\n\nSo the US figures on missing persons, where both countries share the same criteria, are significantly higher. But Mexicos numbers for dissappeared persons is significantly higher, but at the same time their reporting criteria is much lower, so they're not really comparable. - They still have a problem. But that's not to say the US doesn't have its own issues too.\n\nMay as well just discuss how Ecuadorians eat more bananas per capita than the Chinese. - There are other factors at play.",

They'd fight guerilla-style a la Viet Cong/Al-Qaeda, which the US military has historically had issues dealing with.\n\nPicture this: you're on duty in Mexico, and your job is to root out cartel members and eliminate them. But who are they? How many members do they have? Is everyone on this street a member? The older gentleman running the fruit stall, is he a member? That group of kids playing soccer, are they in on it? My point is that they (cartels) can perfectly blend in with the general populace, making it far more difficult to weed them out.\n\nOne last thing: cartels have cells spread all across USA. They're also not above targeting the families of people they might deem responsible for the whole mess.\n\nI guess my point is, any conflict would be long, drawn-out, and *bloody*. And that's not even counting regular Mexican citizens, who might not appreciate foreign incursions. I'm not making any excuses, but that's how I see things playing out.",

Not that human sacrifice hasn't happened other places. It has happened on every continent and that includes Europeans. Just not on the scale that it happened with those 2 societies. \n\nIf all you know of the history of Mexico is the Mayans and the Aztec which that is what most people know and you look at today you can kind of see why people believe that.\n\nI want to make it clear I do not agree. I have lived next door to and worked with Mexicans and only had a problem with one person one time and that was a him problem. Jerks exist in every culture.",
