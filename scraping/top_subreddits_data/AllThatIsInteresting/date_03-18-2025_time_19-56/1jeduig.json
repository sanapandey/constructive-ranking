And if you're luckly like me, your stomach and back of the legs!\n\nIt can make life incredibly painful and uncomfortable to live on top of making me feel ugly, gross and undesirable.\n\nI wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.",

I\u2019ve gotten nonstop comments on it for 20 years now which leads to a lot of insecurity. Sometimes it\u2019s positive like \u201cI love how tall you are\u201d but for the most part I get a lot of \u201chow tall are you? WHY are you so tall? Are your parents tall? (that one is extra fun bc I\u2019m adopted) Do you play basketball?\u201d. People openly stare at me  and make comments about me in public.",

Now, this being said, i recall getting  asked this a lot growing up  ... believe it or not, I  thought, am I not normal ? Or is that question nice .. or mean ? I always found it hard to accept it as a  compliment . Regardless I do feel it is very important to know that your height is unique, and that is what makes you stand out from the crowd  ! \u2728\ufe0f  (literally), but this is a very good thing  !people are fascinated  about your  height .humans are very vocal when they see something thats fascinating to them and that  is a very good thing ! Gir,  just know that we  love the height ! And you have nothing to feel ashamed about ! You found yourself  a positive  community  and a friend today  and know I'm rooting for you  ! Accept your self \u2728\ufe0f \ud83d\ude0c",
