                    "body": "There was a different case in America a few years ago where a woman was dating an ex-con she met through online dating. \n\nThe woman's name was Melissa Norby. She was overweight, not very attractive and quite desperate. She felt he was her \"last chance\" at happiness. He convinced her that in order to keep him as a boyfriend she had to procure kids for him to sexually abuse. She agreed.\n\nShe talked her friend into letting her babysit her 5-year old daughter. Her plan was to allow her boyfriend to come over and sexually abuse the little girl. Instead, the boyfriend double-crossed her, strangled Melissa Norby to death, set her house on fire and kidnapped the little girl.\n\nBut don't worry... The police found the little girl alive (abused, but alive) after 24 hours and the boyfriend (Jacob Kinn) is serving 52 years in prison now.\n\nEDIT: The real scandal is, like most prisoners, he will only serve 2/3 of that sentence. So he will only ACTUALLY serve 34 years!\n\n\"Single ladies, please don't settle for pedophiles...\"",

She went to county jail for something simple like theft. While she was there she served as a lookout while some women raped another woman. She was charged with rape and went to prison. When she got out she killed Victoria. That was an awful awful case. That poor little girl never stood a chance.",
