This should have been deemed illegal but of course it wasn't.\n\nIf they are voting based on faith alone, that makes them restricted. Goldwater warned about these people decades ago, and while he wasn't a great man himself, even a stopped clock is right twice a day:\n\n>\u201cMark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the \\[Republican\\] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise.

Arsenic is not illegal to posses. It's not about the drugs being \"dangerous,\" they are a million times more dangerous when they are illegal and not manufactured in a clean, regulated environment. 99% of what makes drugs dangerous is a direct result of the drugs being illegal!! Portugal made all drugs legal and they have harm reduction education and education on the effects and risks of drugs instead. And overdose deaths there are the lowest out of any country and so are their addiction rates! And they have government funded drug rehabs that aren't based on outdated AA/NA bullshit. Putting someone in prison for doing drugs is a human rights violation! \n\nNon violent criminals should have to pay restitution in various ways depending on ability to any victims rather than be put in a cage, and/or be assigned community service and other similar kinds of consequences. ALL criminals should have to pay some kind of restitution to victims actually. \n\nIf they don't or reoffend, then they should be put in a minimum security facility with social workers and psychologists to figure out what's going on and determine their risk level to society, whether they will escalate, can they be in society, etc. Higher level offending criminals that are identified as potentially able to be rehabilitated should be kept in a humane facility like the above, but with stronger security. And that place should focus on *real* rehabilitation. \n\nBut *prison* should not be a method of \"rehabilitation.\" Some people cannot be rehabilitated, they literally need to be put to death or kept in a cage for life.

I'm not saying it's all their fault, but when good people stand by and do nothing while \"evil\" is committed, especially in a systematic way, well do you think any of your gods would be so forgiving? \n\nWomen and children have been made victims all through out history and well into the future, but right now there are those that would have us believe that they are not so \"bad\". So pressure can be put on them as they attempt to keep up the appearance.. and who better than the caregiver, nurturer, the mother, love embodied. One needs to take advantage of the reality that many people, even if they succumb to their selfishness or lesser versions of themselves, that they don't necessarily want to appear \"bad\" in the eyes of her. Call it evolution, or conditioning, or whatever. All I'm saying is the woman, particularly those with love in their hearts, are the best shields AND swords for fight against what you and I might call evil. Especially when they (the baddies) don't want to appear so if they truly are; gives them away to obviously.\n\nBut going back to the original post and how it seems to be understood that a tragedy took place. There should be enough evidence that incarceration has much more negative impact on the individual and communities as a whole, and after decades of data and research this is plainly obvious. We're in the age of extreme criticism and analysis, nothing can even be hidden from us anymore, and with AI nothing will ever be again. \n\nMake an AI with it's sole intention of improving things in general, and have it tell you the same shit.. \n\nSacrifice mothers for the greater good(put them in front of the cross hairs), or just let ourselves be collectively reduced by tyranny into subhumans we all are..",
