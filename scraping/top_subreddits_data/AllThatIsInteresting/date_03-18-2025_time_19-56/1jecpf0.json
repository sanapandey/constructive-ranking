It means that women have the power (as they should) to either decline the act. That also means they have the power to accept it. Men have no choice but to wait for consent (as they should). A woman consenting to get penetrated by a man (or boy) who also consents is different when roles are reversed due to the act of penetration.\n\nIn this case this is a horny high school boy, who 100% knows and watches \ud83c\udf3d and nuts at least once a day. Free \ud83d\udc31 is a godsend. One from a hot chick they probably already fantasized about? That's what dreams are made of. \n\nFunny people advocating for equality can't accept the power of a woman. Sure there are exceptions, but more times than not you don't need to convince men to have sex, while it's the reverse for women. That's the difference.",

            "body": "As a male survivor of CSA, I will copy and paste my usual tirade about the immature guys making jokes about this:\nI am so tired of hearing immature guys joking about teachers SAing boys\n\n\n  \nI absolutely HATE seeing stories about women teachers messing with boys and seeing nasty, immature, stupid, degenerate dudes in the comments laughing and saying \"oh, that should have been me!\" or \"wow, what a lucky kid!\" \n\n  \nI usually clench my teeth and think of these four points:\n\n1) Yes, teenage boys and preteen boys often have fantasies about adult women. And guess what? They also have fantasies about being war heroes. So, are boys who are sent to fight in wars in Africa and for ISIS or whatnot \"lucky\" that they got to see some action? No. \n\nBecause guess what: THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS NORMAL AND HEALTHY FOR A BOY TO HAVE FANTASIES ABOUT AND WHAT HE CAN HANDLE IN REAL LIFE. \n\n  \n2) You know what a little kid, like ages 4-11ish would probably enjoy? Face painting with radium. I mean, it is pretty glow in the dark paint. It would be fun and after they were done they'd skip away and laugh...and then, as the years pass, their bodies will fall apart and cancers will grow inside them, destroying them. \n\n  \nLikewise, a young boy who is abused by an older woman may \"enjoy\" that too, but much like radiation poisoning by radium, it will slowly fester in them, destroying them. I've seen so many men who thought they enjoyed it, but ended up with addictions, panic attacks, promiscuity, and all kinds of other issues later on. Their minds will fall apart later on. \n\n  \nI talked to one man who swore up and down that his \"fling\" (as he called it) with a woman in her late 30s when he was 15 had no negative impact on him. I asked him how his relationships were and he said, quote \"all great. **All three** of my marriages were great until the end\" \n\n  \nHe just couldn't admit that it obviously did have an impact. \n\n  \nWe don't let kids do things that they may like at the moment because we know the long term consequences of them, and this is one of them. And the adult is wrong for messing with them, even if they appeared to be interested in it. They're kids. \n\n  \n3) Would they say the same thing about a gay kid getting SA'd by a male teacher? I mean, when I was a kid, Jean Claude Van Damme helped me realize I was bisexual, and yes, I rewound that scene in \"Universal Soldier\" where you see his bare ass so many times it almost broke the tape, but still, I was just a kid. I doubt these chuds would ever say that a 13 year old gay boy who got SA'd by a handsome teacher got \"lucky\" \n\n  \n4) and most of all, I just want to ask them if they'd like to trade places with me. My Mom did this to me when I was like a toddler (I think) until I was 11 years old. After all the anxiety, low self esteem, body image issues, anger, attachment issues, aversion to touch, and outright difficulty with intimacy to the point that my one gf ever dumped me because she couldn't handle a panic attack I had during sex, believe it or not,  **I don't feel like I was lucky**\n\n  \n Society does not value our boys, and alas, it's these nasty, usually boomer dudes who are some of the worst offenders in the misandry department.",

That not one other relationship he had since then worked out for him and that he just couldn't find girls his age attractive. \n\nPeople started connecting the dots for him, but I didn't think he was listening.",

There are other charges (like sodomy) for other forms of sexual crimes. Sexual assault is all inclusive whereas rape is sometimes specific to a particular action. I'm not sure why people think sexual assault is less severe, it's just the blanket term for all sexual related crimes. Rape is a type of sexual assault.",

I think it's a bit voyeuristic to make those details so public. Obviously you could look up the case and know, but sexual assault seems plenty descriptions for the 5 o'clock news. We don't need to know it was forced oral sex or sodomy, that's for the courts. I think using sexual assault is much more for the victim than the perpetrator.",
