Im sure he wasn't direct with his interest but kids aren't subtle about their feelings either. \n\nWe also have no clue if her own marriage was troubled at the time (not saying it as an excuse) so if it was and you have this little kid who you see everyday, showing you an abundance of attention and affection cause he has a little crush on you and you're at a weak point in your own marriage? I guess you could say she got \"caught up\" in her own feelings. Most people would feel flattered that a kid thinks they're attractive and at the very least think \"i still got it\" and ride that high knowing they can do better than what they have.\n\nBut she's a pedophile so she saw this child as the same level (re: age and maturity) as her own husband and committed this heinous act for who knows how long to feel validated. I doubt she had any real feelings for this kid but i think he did for her and that's why HE ended the abuse: Because he knew how wrong it was (or how wrong it felt once the \"excitement\" wore off.)\n\nWe've all been kids and had crushes on older people. if it wasn't an attractive teacher we were wanting, it was an attractive celebrity at the very least. Thankfully, i think most of us didn't have attractive teachers or at the very least, we had kiddy diddlers that didn't want us or hid their sick desires well. I can admit that a pedophile was outed at one of my former Highschools a few years after i graduated.\n\nI accept the hate i get but i feel kids need to be educated on grooming and pedophiles as much as adults should already know not to fucking touch kids. These kids are more hormonal and ignorant of life, adulthood and consequences and we expect them to be competent and functioning by 18 when we do NOTHING to set them up for success mentally and socially by that age. This is where having sex education really comes in.",
