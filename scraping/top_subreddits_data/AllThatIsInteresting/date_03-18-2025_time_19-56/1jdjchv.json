If their worry was truly only about modesty, nobody would have mentioned that second part because no men would have found it sexual. And yet they absolutely did, because it WAS sexual, at least within the context of their culture and time period.\n\nIf your only issue is being stuck on the ankles thing, please replace that with whichever non-gentital body part you'd like. Shoulders are a great example. Modern women aren't told to cover shoulders out of pure modesty- they are specifically told that their shoulders arouse and distract men. Shoulders can be sexualized, just as every other inch of skin on women has been at some place and time.\n\nThankfully, you've already acknowledged the obvious: that women can and already do walk around topless in several parts of the world without incident. That fact alone makes anything else either you or I could say on the matter useless semantics. The debate has already been decided: it's literally fine.",

That something can be sexualized, does not mean that something is sexualized or has been sexualized.\u00a0\n\n\nPlease, you have all of history to choose from. Show me a timeperiod in the past, where the sexualization of anything except for the genitalia, buttocks, and breasts, was prevalent.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is truly about modesty, as history evinces. In Islam women are expected to cover their hair. Please demonstrate the sexualization of hair. You can't.\nAlso in Islam men are also expected to dress modestly, as were men when Christian norms dominated Europe. Was that because their arms and ankles were sexualized?\u00a0\n\n\nI didn't acknowledge that, please actually read my comment. I said that even in some past societies where it was normalized for a woman to walk around top less, the breasts were still sexualized.\u00a0\n\n\nThat women today can and do walk around top less in some places doesn't mean it's normalized.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you haven't caught on by the way, my overarching point is that the breasts of men and women are justifiably treated differently because one is sexualized, has been consistently and with prevalence sexualized throughout most of history in nearly every society, and the other is not and has not.\u00a0",

Exactly how many times do men need to make sexual comments about women's legs, shoulders, neck, midriff, feet for that to register for you?\n\nThat's not very good advice. If you're trying to make macro claims about what is prevalent in society, then it's not only about the anecdotal evidence you collect by \"going outside.\" This is something that's measured by the media, internet, literature etc. And I honestly think you should seek your own advice if you believe the sexualization of shoulders, neck, and feet are prevalent. \"You've got a sexy neck!\" .....?????\n\nDo you read erotica? Have you read erotica in the past? Is the sexualization of feet, ankles, necks, etc. common? No, it isn't. What is common is the sexualization of breasts, buttocks, genitalia and to a lesser extent legs and thighs.\n\nIs there any society on this planet where its common for men to obtain breast implants? Why not? \n\n>How many times do women need to be told, in clear and plain language, that the function of covering these body parts is to avoid making men too horny? That showing these non-genital body parts is enough to cause adultery and sexual assault? Come on, man. You know all this already\n\nI do know this already. I also know that common retort to such nonsense is: \"Hey, that's nonsense, these aren't sexualized, *they're not like breasts, genitalia, and buttocks,* and so therefore it's ridiculous to expect us to cover up. Just because some idiots say that it can make men horny, it doesn't mean they can. \n\nMy argument has an entire history, an entire corpus of evidence supporting it, while you have nothing but the advisory ramblings of some puritan morons in the past.\n\n>And unless you're very young, you've read enough National Geographic to know damn well that multiple indigenous + tropical communities continue to allow female toplessness to this very day. You can watch videos of these women going about their day casually. Are they existing in a constant state of orgy or facing constant sexual harrassment? Of course not! When all women in a society display a body part constantly, it becomes normalized! That's what normalization means!\n\nThat an incredibly small pocket of humans in the present are an exception to the rule only proves the rule. Young or old, this is rudimentary logic. You're actually supporting my argument by pointing to obscure tribes. Also, if you pay attention to those National Geographic videos you'll find that these tribes have dynamics that aid in normalization: for example, these tribes are almost all related, they are extremely small in number, etc. \n\nYou will actually find that the larger and more complex the tribe, the less that is normalized.",

We already know that men can see things that arouse them in public and function perfectly fine. There is no universe in which this debate ends in justifying gender-segregated clothing mandates.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's a good idea to normalize it. And no actually, in most societies today a woman cannot go topless in public without being fined for indecency. Why don't we explore how committed you actually are to this. Is there objectively anything wrong with a man showing his genitalia in public? If a man came to your child's school with penis and nuts dangling, and there is absolutely no sexual intent or perversity involved, is there anything wrong with that? No there isn't. But we don't normalize it because the male genitalia is consistently and with prevalence sexualized. Show me the difference between what you're advocating (women walking into a daycare topless) and the scenario I presented.\n\nIf you truly believe it should be normalized and there's nothing wrong with women walking around topless, then you shouldn't make exceptions, you should be fine with this being done at a daycare, at a school (imagine a teacher teaching topless at a public school ffs), at the grocery store, etc. And this is why I'm glad people like you aren't in charge of making these rules.\n\n>There is no universe in which this debate ends in justifying gender-segregated clothing mandates.\n\nI've actually made a great case for justifying it, while you've been rehashing the same old tired points. Furthermore, in nearly every society in the world and in the past, gender-segregated clothing mandates are and have been justified. You are a tiny minority.",
