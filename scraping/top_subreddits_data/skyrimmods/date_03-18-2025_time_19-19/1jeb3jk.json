    "selftext": "Even though I've been in the scene since 2014, learning the CK has always felt so daunting that I avoided using it besides converting oldrim mods. That changed this weekend!\n\n[I made my first ever patch!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145073) (Personal xedit stuff excluded) Being able to edit and see my changes in-game was exhilarating. If you'd like to get into modding but have been on the fence - just try it! It's seriously a blast, and now I've got tons of ideas for standalone mods that I can't wait to get started on.\n\n\nShout-out to the goat, robertgk2017. Without him, I'd still be struggling with the Eldritch horror that is the base CK. Seriously, please get [CKPE](https://github.com/Perchik71/Creation-Kit-Platform-Extended). It's better in every way and doesn't throw you a billion errors and crash every hour. (Also, dark mode!!!)",

It's low key one of my most frustrating things about mods; Many authors just throw away their titles and in doing so, completely hamstring discoverability. Your title will hit lots of search terms to help modders looking find that which they may be seeking. Kudos!",
