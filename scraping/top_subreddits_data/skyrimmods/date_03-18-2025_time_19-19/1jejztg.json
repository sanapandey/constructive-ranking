    "selftext": "Thinking of making a mod that re-writes these dialogue options to where the PC doesn\u2019t sound so ignorant.\n\n\u201cWho is Vaermina?\u201d -> \u201cTell me what you know about Vaermina\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Elder Scroll? What\u2019s that?\u201d -> \u201cWhat do the dragons know about Elder Scrolls?\u201d (Paarthurnax)\n\nI think this would help RP overall, especially for learned characters. I would imagine a typical person in the Elder Scrolls world to know what an Elder Scroll or a daedric prince is anyway.",
