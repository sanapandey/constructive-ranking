            "body": "If Skyrim Special Edition crashes immediately after you launch it \u2014 particularly if your crash log lists memory address `0198090` address (version 1.6.640 address) or `05E1F22` (1.5.97 address) \u2014 then you are experiencing one of the following issues:\n\n* You are missing a master file. That is: you have some Mod A that relies on Mod B, but you only installed Mod A and not Mod B.\n\n* More likely: one of your installed mods (or an official content file) may have file format version 1.71, meaning it was made for game version 1.6.1130 or higher. This format is not fully backwards compatible; if you're running an older version of the game, then these files can cause crashes on startup. Installing [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441?tab=files) will allow older versions of the game to load these files safely.\n\nMake sure to check the [troubleshooting guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/troubleshooting_guide) for help with crashes and other problems!\n \n* If you are on Skyrim version 1.5 (SE), the [.NET Script Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21294) can also help in diagnosing crashes.\n\n* If you are on Skyrim Version 1.6 (AE) or Skyrim VR, [Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818) can also help in diagnosing crashes. If you also use MO2, you can use [this plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66743) for improved functionality!\n \nDO NOT post an analyzed crash log. It strips all the useful information.\n\nDon't use trainwreck. The log it produces is less informative than other options linked above. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
