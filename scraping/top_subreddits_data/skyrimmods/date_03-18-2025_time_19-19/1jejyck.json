    "selftext": "Ive tried looking around online, and making sure Ive been following the guides. but for some reason once the grass cache finishes, after about 30s - a minute, the folder empties itself out. I made sure to watch and it WAS generating the files, but after it finished for some reason it decides to empty the folder out and I'm not really sure how to diagnose what causes this so i came here to see if anyone else knows what could be causing this?\n\n\\[Loadorderlibrary\\](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/alextrica-modlist)",
