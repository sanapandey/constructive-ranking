I can't believe after all this time we don't have a sweetroll recovery quest.\n\nHow to start the quest:  Go to the Bannered Mare and buy a sweetroll. Head outside. Someone will hit you over the head and you'll black out. When you wake up there will be a bunch of concerned Whiterun citizens standing around you going \"Oh, what happened?\" and a guard comes over and says \"What's the matter? someone stole your sweetroll?\" A witness will come forward and say that, yes, this is exactly what happened. Your quest is to find a guard who cares and will help you track down the thief. It should probably involve them selling the stolen sweetroll to Belethor, for reasons...probably drugs. Maybe the sweetroll conceals moon sugar and it was given to your character by mistake. Who knows? But I'd play that mod.",

The Penitus Oculatus should know something about it, they know a thing or two about fake gourmets yet they seem oddly indiferent when it comes to pastry. The whole thing stinks of conspiracy. \n\n  \n(Or it's just that little brat Braith, bugging the Dragonborn again.)",
