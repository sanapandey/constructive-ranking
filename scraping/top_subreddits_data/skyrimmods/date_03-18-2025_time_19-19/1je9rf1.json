    "selftext": "[https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144451](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144451)\n\n\nIntroducing Lives of the Saints, a Dunmer-focused religion addon featuring 6 followable saints (including the former Tribunal) with **unique abilities that scale** through your whole playthrough. I designed this mod to be fully-featured but **compatible with literally everything, including Gods and Worship, Wintersun, Pilgrim, and every permutation of Skyrim SE imaginable**.\n\n\n It's designed to be lightweight and work with any character, Dunmer or not, while providing unique playstyles and abilities. Some Saints strongly encourage you to pursue a specific playstyle, like Almalexia's buff to wielding only a single one-handed weapon, while Nerevar encourages you to develop your character in any way you see fit, adapting its bonuses to your questline choices instead. \n\nYou can choose your saint by reading the lore book in your inventory at game start, though you're welcome to put it in a barrel somewhere if you don't want to use it on that playthrough. \n\nThe saints included in 1.0 are the following:\n\n\n**Saint Nerevar, the Captain**\n\n\n*Ability: Moon-and-Star*\n\n\nFate smiles upon you. As you complete prophecies around Tamriel, you **gain unique perks based on your choices**. Destroy the Dark Brotherhood? There's a perk for that! Join them and kill the emperor? There's a perk for that too! Regardless of who you side with in any major questline or conflict, you'll get a nice capstone reward. There are 11 perks at release (College of Winterhold, Companions, Thieves Guild/Nightengale, Dawnguard, Volkihar, Imperial, Stormcloak, Dragonborn, Main Questline, Destroying the DB, and killing the emperor as leader of the DB.) \n\n**Saint Veloth, the Pilgrim**\n\n\n*Ability: Resdayn's Promise*\n\n\nFollow in the footsteps of the Saint who created Dunmer society as we know it. Move 15% faster when unarmored. **As you discover more locations, you gain a scaling bonus to all experience gained.** \n\n**Saint Vivec, the Warrior-Poet**\n\n\n*Ability: Reach Heaven Through Violence*\n\n\nEmbody the cunning of the Warrior-Poet. Gain Speech experience when killing much stronger enemies or giant, ancient, or otherworldly foes. **Deal more damage with all weapons based on your speech skill.** \n\n**Blessed Almalexia, the Warden**\n\n\n*Ability: Lady of Mercy*\n\n\nShow the cruel mercy of Almalexia. Deal 40% more damage when wielding a one-handed weapon in your main hand and nothing in your offhand. As you complete miscellaneous tasks for the people of Tamriel, **gain a scaling bonus to all One-Handed damage.**\n\n**Sotha Sil, the Teacher**\n\n*Ability: Light of Knowledge*\n\n\nDelve deep into Dwemer ruins to unlock the mysteries of Tamriel. Gain enchanting XP when killing Dwemer automatons, and **all spell magnitude scales with Enchanting.** \n\n\nand of course one of Morrowind's most legendary saints had to be included, \n\n**Saint Jiub the Magnificent, Exterminator of the Winged Menace**\n\n\n*Ability: The Redeemed*\n\nAs you absorb dragon souls, deal additional damage to dragons and other winged menaces. When you kill a dragon, **all bounties in that province (Morrowind or Skyrim) are erased.** Be a murder hobo or serial thief and be forgiven for it! No one will hear about it if you kill a dragon in Oblivion or Blackreach though. \n\n\nI had a ton of fun making this mod, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. **I hope you'll give it a shot!**",
