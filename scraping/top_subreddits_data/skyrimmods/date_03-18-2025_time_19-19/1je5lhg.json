So do you know guys any mods like that: [Dwueth'Var - The Star Razor at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62714) when you actually have to collect some stuff previosuly - sometimes without markers? Or maybe some cool questlines with great weapon/armor at the end? Or maybe the weapon is just laying around somewhere as a reward for a good eye?",

This makes it very nice for items that would otherwise need additem menus.\u00a0",
