    "selftext": "Just curious. I\u2019m currently running eldergleam and think it\u2019s brilliant but skyrim gameplay is largely just the same, with a fresh coat of paint. I had to change difficulty from Adept to Expert to incorporate more of a challenge, I\u2019m also using Survival Mode.\n\nI did mess around with the Skyrim Constellations mod collection and though the gameplay was excellent, but the graphics, although good, wouldn\u2019t touch Eldergleam\u2019s visuals.\n\nAs a side note I just got the new AMD Radeon 9070xt and am getting 100-120fps outdoors and 120fps indoors, at 4K resolution. Its actually incredible.",
