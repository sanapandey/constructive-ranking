I think this subreddit often thinks that adding hundreds of mods to their game is the norm, when I'm fairly certain stats that Dark0ne gave a few years ago showed that something like more than 80% of Nexus Mods users have downloaded less than 50 mods for Skyrim. I wouldn't call those users \"power users\".  \n  \nWith the advent of Steam Workshop and in-game mod systems modding definitely is not as \"niche\" or considered as \"advanced\" as it used to be.",

Nexus Mods own mission statement is to \"make free modding easy\". No mention of power users there.\n\nWith millions of people downloading mods for Skyrim each week on Nexus, calling everyone on the site \"power users\" misses the mark by a wide margin, especially in the context of how it was originally raised, which was \"anyone using mods is a power user so the site design should be made for power users in mind\" - something I fundamentally disagree with.

I do agree that the 113 is probably too small to be accurate at scale, but apparently even 30 people can give an accurate result.\n\nThe caveat, which is very much worth pointing out here, is that those 1000 people need to be proportionally accurate in representation to the full population being sampled.
