    "selftext": "Here is mine.\n\nI had a pretty big personal modlist (or as my friends and I jokingly called it: Elden Ring 28) with around 2500 mods and it would have kept growing until this event happened.\n\nMy friend needed a Win11 boot drive so he brought me an empty pendrive and asked me to put the Windows installer there. For some reason the installer program defaulted to the external SSD on which my modlist was and formatted the whole thing.\n\nAn entire summer's work gone in a mouse click. Haven't really touched Skyrim since, I've been thinking about downloading Wabbajack lists but they lack the personal factor which my old list had.\n\nHave any of you guys had similar experiences?",

Crazy fun.\n\nDestruction came out, it was flashy.  \nthen Restoration made paladins more interesting than before.  \nIllusion made it a favorite.  \nConjuration solidly made me a life-long fan...  \n......\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand then the mod author evaporated from the internet, never actually adding the Alteration spells. 3 or more years of slowly building up the mod update by update, and one day... the mod just died right by the finish line. :(\n\nThese days it only works due to other people patching it for stability with new versions; and it still works like a charm, but man- what sort of reality-warpy madness could this guy have pulled off had Alteration been tackled...?",

The fact people still make free mods today is proof of that. If that's your only concern, I hope the past decade of evidence to the contrary has alleviated that fear.",

I didn't think I needed to address it. I think that's a dumb rule, needlessly vindictive and anti-user. It makes both paid and free mods worse.\n\nOr do you mean paying for a mod and it not working, like the mod itself is broken by the mod author's fault? I 100% agree that there should be a better refund policy in cases like that, it's totally unfair to pay for something that doesn't work and be stuck with it. There are definitely some major faults with *how* Bethesda handles paid mods, but conceptually I don't think paid mods themselves are a problem.",

Then if I mod certain files that need to be a certain way for a different profile or game version I just repeat the process delete the files and then copy the clean files back into the folder. MO2 works great like this. For example I just deleted everything yesterday to try the LoreTrim modlist( auto downgrades you to 1.5.97) and although it's perfect in my opinion I actually hate the controls and I cannot play Skyrim with a keyboard and mouse and I was too lazy to figure out how to change everything and disable mods and worry about issues and patching. So all I did was delete the install folder and copy and paste my AE version back into the folder and booted up my personal 900 mo2 modlist and bam. Back with no issues. If you do this I would recommend also copy and pasting a copy of the Skyrim special edition folder in MyGames finder in documents. The first time I did this I did not do that but I found no issues but I would recommend that you do. Hope this helps somebody avoid more issues in the future",

I wanted so badly to make it work and stick with GOG; even after mods started coming out that required 1130+, I still stuck to 1.6.659, hoping that eventually all of my mods would work properly on 1.6.1179...I waited for months, but eventually, the only mod I cared about that wouldn't work properly on 1179 was Auto Input Switch.  That was very unfortunate, because Auto Input Switch is a non-negotiable mod for me, due to how I make use of my gamepad's unused buttons (PS button, touchpad presses) by binding them to keyboard keys.  Auto Input Switch works perfectly fine on 1170, but according to the log file, it fails to install one of the hooks on 1179, which causes some weird fuckup where if you touch the mouse, the camera spazzes out and the game usually crashes after a few seconds of that.\n\nThere was also the whole mess where xEdit doesn't properly support GOG and required either command line arguments or a symbolic link to make it work correctly, and the difficulty getting the CK to work correctly with it.  In the end, I simply couldn't justify sticking with GOG when it caused me *more* headaches than just using the Steam version.  I wanted to use some of the cool 1130+ mods like Staff Enchanting Plus, and was tired of being stuck on 1.6.659, waiting for an update that might never come.  So with a heavy heart, I deleted the GOG version completely, re-installed the Steam version, moved all the MO2 paths to point at the Steam version, and updated all my SKSE plugins.  Game works fine now, but I was very unhappy to have my hand forced.",
