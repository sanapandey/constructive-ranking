For example Marvel Rivals had an issue where playing Ranked would cause the game to crash, which was a problem.\n\nBy contrast, if your game crashes when you walk into the Bannered Mare, then you reload the game and walk back in to no crash, you are probably fine. If it crashes every single time you do something specific (boot the game up, equip a weapon, open a door, talk to a specific NPC, etc) then that is a problem you should look into.\n\nEven if your modlist is causing the crash, though, there's usually a reason for that. It's usually not something you need to jettison your modlist for. Rather, usually you just have to fix or update one mod or one mod in particular isn't playing nice with the others. There are a few tools you can use to figure out what might cause it, but getting a crash log is usually best.",

The most current Steam version is `1.6.1170`.\n\nPay the closest attention to the third number in that sequence, a.k.a. 1170. You'll want mods that explicitly say they're for version 1170 or that are compatible with, for example, \"629 and above\" or \"640 and above\". (Basically, the lower the third number = the older the version. 629 is lower than 1,170, therefore it's the older game version).\n\nWhen downloading SKSE plugins (usually these are requirements for other mods), try to see if there's an \"NG\" version. \"NG\" basically means that mod will work with whatever Skyrim version you have, even if you update the game in the future*. One example I can think of is Mfg Fix and Mfg Fix NG. Also, pay attention to the instructions as the original mod may be required by the NG version.\n\n* = As long as your {{Address Library for SKSE Plugins}} is updated",

It can have a number value with decimals\n\ni = integer. number value, but whole numbers only.\n\ns = string. Can have a text value (you'd still need additional context for the setting to know what text is valid).\n\n\nBasically they tell you the format of the value for the setting, but not necessarily enough to know what all valid values are. A setting starting with f will accept float values, but the 'f' doesn't tell you what the valid range is.",

Not all mods contain meshes of their own, however, so in those cases you'd have to install the base game meshes as a mod first. But then you'd also have to switch between the texture mods to see how it affects the appearance of the mesh.",

Wanted to check:-\n\n1. What's the cut-off point for mods that haven't been updated but can be safe to use? Like, if a mod's not been updated since 2020, is it still good to use or should I look for more recent alternatives?\n2. {{ Immersive HUD }} / iHud's not been updated since 2017 - is it still okay to use in 2025 with 1.6.1170? If not, is there a more modern alternative of hiding the UI like iHUD does?\n3. I used {{ Undergrowth Hollow }} as my character's home in my last playthrough, but likewise it's not been updated for a few years. Just in case that one doesn't work, does anyone have any recommendations for similar grotto/cave homes?",

The UI was still present, I could still hear sound, and I could still move my character and interact with the world. I assumed it was a gpu driver issue but after updating and reinstalling a few times nothing changed. I checked if the same happened with a fresh save and tried to recreate what i was doing when the screen would go black, but it seemed to be working fine, so the only thing i can think of now is that the save is corrupted. Thoughts? Its not a big issue for me and I dont really mind starting a new save but Its a bit annoying.",
