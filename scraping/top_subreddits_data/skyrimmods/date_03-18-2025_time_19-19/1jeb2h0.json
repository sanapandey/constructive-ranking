    "selftext": "I've always hated having to restart a play through after adding more and more mods, forever enhancing my game with all of the revolutionary work done by these creatures. Of course, it's not good to add and remove mods mid-play through, and I always hated the idea of losing a character I've created. \n\nI found a feature in the mod Proteus that allows you to save a character and import them from a saved cache. It saves their stats, inventory, etc. and allows you to bring them into your current game. Now, when I play, I will create a back story for the new character, play through their story (druid, thief, assassin, etc.) and save them when it's time to try new mods out or remove them. Then, I can use them in my next play through as a follower for my new character! I have to say that this has completely changed how I play, and getting to swap between characters is a great feature. It also prevents save bloat and long load time for long running play throughs.\n\nI know Proteus has its bugs and issues but I mostly only use that feature from it. To me it's completely changed how I play. Anyone else do this too? \n\n**Edit - to confirm no world progress is saved, it's like starting a new game every time, but you can save the individual character! ",
