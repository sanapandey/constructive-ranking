The AE version is constantly being updated, and I'm not well-versed in classic mods but it's worth checking out if you haven't. Alternatively, Bards College/Bards Reborn and similar mods all take place in Solitude since like, the college is there. Most Solitude mods, like other city mods, are just superficial overhauls. Depending on your interest, I'd suggest checking out Nexus' guild/faction category too.",

I'd also go for {{Legacy of the Dragonborn}} like another suggested, though that mod is definitely counting on your character *being* the Dragonborn in certain lines of dialogue (it doesn't break any quests or anything, but certain lines make it clear the museum is *about you* and not just the artifacts - but those lines *might* only trigger if you've progressed the main quest a certain degree) and because it touches a lot, it can be a bit incompatible if you're running major overhauls (usually it's just things like archeology excavation tents clipping with things, not crashes). There was {{More to do in the Bards College - The Shadow Song}} but that's apparently been taken down; all that's left is translation patches for now. And I could've sworn there was an expansion of the verses of Olaf quest, but I can't seem to find it again.",
