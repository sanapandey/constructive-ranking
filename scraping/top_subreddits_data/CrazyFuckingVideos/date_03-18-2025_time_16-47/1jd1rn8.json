With exact wording and what I'm hoping is a good explanation of the thought process behind each part of the original comment. \n\n\n\n\"At first I was like, yeah get them doors open, feed that fire the oxygen it wants-\"\n\nIn this first half of the comment, GloomySugar95 is saying that, AT FIRST, meaning, BEFORE or PRIOR TO, their realisation of what was going on, at that PRESENT MOMENT they thought \"yeah great idea, feed the fire by opening the door to let in more oxygen\"\n\nThis was sarcasm. Opening a door to allow oxygen to flood the room where a fire is burning is usually a bad idea, so it was a perplexing thing to do. \n\nAt this juncture, I'd like to point out that fire can be stifled by closing doors and windows as you evacuate a building to reduce the amount of oxygen it has access to. I won't go into detail about how Oxygen flow works or flash fires, because that's a whole physics course we don't have time for in this lesson. \n\n\n\n\"-Then I saw they towed it out and I was surprised at their level head in an extreme situation.\"\n\nThis second half of the comment highlights that GloomySugar95 realises after his first thought that the OPs goal wasn't to feed oxygen to the fire and hasten the burning of their house to the ground, but (seeing the towing taking place) that OP's intention was to actually tow the vehicle out of the house, thus saving the house from getting set ablaze. \n\n  \nIn conclusion. \n\n\"At first I was like, yeah get them doors open, feed that fire the oxygen it wants\n\nThen I saw they towed it out and I was surprised at their level head in an extreme situation.\"\n\nIs a commentary of the events in the first part of the video leading up to the opening of the door, which would have been dumb, and then commenting on the subversion of OP towing the car out of the house, which was, indeed, quick thinking on his part. \n\n  \nThank you for coming to my TED talk, I've been up for over 24 hours and I'm happy to try to keep explaining it to you in a way you'll understand, I don't mind. Seriously. I'm in too deep to give up on you now, PLEASE SAY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WEREN'T IMPLYING THE OP SHOULD HAVE SAT AND WATCHED THE FIRE UNTIL THEY SUFFOCATED TO DEATH PLEASE OH GOD I'M SO TIRED. \n\n  \nTL;DR: You don't need to save face.",
