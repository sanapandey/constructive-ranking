Most *real pimps* are understated and keep a low profile for obvious reasons,  And to that point, even many prostitutes are not what the media makes them out to be - the street walkers in skimpy threads.  This exists but both of these images are the exception/outliers.  Hell, in LA they take credit card.\n\nedit: Oh, and I state this as someone who never once used a prostitute - but as someone who stomped around city and casino nightlife enough to fill a few lifetimes, someone who has friends that partook, and as someone who is very well versed/familiar on spotting Human Trafficking signs.\n\nBTW - absolutely legalize prostitution for the safety and protection of the women involved.",
