This video exemplifies what the IAA describes as \"unruly passenger behavior,\" which would very likely lead to this passenger being unable to fly again. \n\n>Specifically, the industry aims to boost its ability to **ban passengers through no-fly lists,** ensure Gardai are informed of all criminal activity, enhance training for cabin crew and improve communication to passengers to prevent unruly behaviour.\n\nIs the Garda\u00ed no longer a part of the Irish government, even though the commissioner is appointed by the Irish government?",
