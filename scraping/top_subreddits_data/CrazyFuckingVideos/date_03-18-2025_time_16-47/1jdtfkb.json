Their mother is feral and extremely dangerous. She will actively attack you if you are close enough. After a lot of hissing, spitting and growling I managed to pick one of the kittens up. It could not have been much older than 2-3 weeks. It went absolutely crazy! Biting, scratching, clawing, kicking, twisting, anything it could do to escape. The mother car immediately came to its defense and attacked both my legs, grabbing on with all 4 paws and biting with real intent. I managed to get the kitten into a box and got out of the room. I was bleeding from multiple puncture wounds on my legs, hands and arms. That was the day I realised how dangerous house cats can be.",
