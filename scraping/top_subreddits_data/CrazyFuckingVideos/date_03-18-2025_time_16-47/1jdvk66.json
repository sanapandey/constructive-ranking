Motherfuckers almost killed a child because they didn't even bother to close off the area or even signal that they were doing some work there.\n\nAnyway part of the branch ended up breaking the window of the first floor apartment on the building, and for some stupid reason the guy chopping the tree wanted to remove all the glass still attached to the frame and almost chopped off his own fingers when one big shard came down. He did get a big cut and lost a lot of blood but didn't lose the finger.\nI really hope he never got to do heavy and dangerous work ever again, truly a big dumbass, at least he only hurt himself that time.",
