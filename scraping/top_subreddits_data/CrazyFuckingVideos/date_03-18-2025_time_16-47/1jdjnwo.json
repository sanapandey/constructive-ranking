Without cleanup efforts it will take a really long time for all the plastics to cease causing widespread damage to sea life, decades to centuries or longer.\n\nClimate change would take centuries to millennia to recover, pollution in the upper atmosphere will continue to warm the planet for centuries. The ice in the artics and Greenland will continue to melt for centuries and global sea levels will continue to rise, also for centuries.\n\nBiodiversity will take millennia to recover. Animals that are considered endangered will pretty much all go extinct as conditions will still worsen in the short term and will take too long to improve.\n\nIt\u2019s actually so strange that individuals will tell you they love their kids and grandkids etc but on the other hand as a collective we don\u2019t give a shit about them. If we actually cared about them we would collectively be working to make the planet better (and we have the technology and the means to do it), but instead we have politicians with tiny penises making war, threatening to annex sovereign nations and generally being dickheads. \u201cDrill baby drill\u201d\n\nSo again the answer sadly, is a loud resounding no. The next 100 years it\u2019s going to get wild, massive food and water shortages, rapid extinction of species like bees and other pollinators resulting in a huge threat to global agriculture. The destruction of natural habitats increases zoonotic spillover, so there will be lots more diseases like covid or worse. \n\nGenerally just happy times ahead really",

The phrase was popular vernacular for half a century, all thanks to Disney. \n\nDisney wanted to include \u201clemming behaviors\u201d in their nature documentary *\u2019White Wilderness.\u2019* Unfortunately lemmings are relatively intelligent living beings with a sense of self preservation and desire to live under normal circumstances. Disney quickly realized they weren\u2019t getting any film of lemmings committing mass suicide. \n\nThe solution was to capture hundreds of lemmings, release them on the edge of a cliff inside a barrier, then slowly move the barriers, forcing what might as well be puppies and kittens toward the edge of the cliff until they jumped en mass. After multiple takes the \u201cresult\u201d was a single, short scene with a limited field of view showing hundred of lemmings falling to their deaths, decades of widespread misinformation, a video game franchise that\u2019s endured for >30 years, and Disney still denying any culpability for their film and trying to blame a single person.",
