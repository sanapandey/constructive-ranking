Deputy Morales confiscated the drug and the man was cited for possession. Hours later, security cameras in the sheriff's office caught Deputy Morales walking into the bathroom, where his unconscious body would be found moments later by a fellow deputy. He got assistance from other deputies who revived Deputy Morales with multiple doses of Narcan. Deputy Morales then regained consciousness at the hospital. \n\nAccording to a report from the Sacramento Sheriff's Office, while on duty and in full uniform, Deputy Morales intentionally smoked the drug in the restroom of the sheriff\u2019s office. The substance turned out to be fentanyl. Deputy Morales reportedly smoked the drug out of a glass pipe that he also obtained on the job, and lied about disposing of months earlier. He would later admit that he took the pipe home and smoked the residue out of it three or four times, per authorities. Sheriff\u2019s internal investigators recommended that Morales be fired on grounds of dishonesty and informed him of this recommended discipline Jan. 4, 2024. Morales submitted his resignation Feb. 2, 2024, and it was accepted the following day, Sheriff\u2019s Office documents show.",
