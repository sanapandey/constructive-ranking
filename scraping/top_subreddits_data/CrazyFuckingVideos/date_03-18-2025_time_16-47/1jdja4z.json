Self drilling screws aren't used in ortho though (maybe OMFS?) at least not from my recollection.",

Through the face cover. So, I might as well write it down\"\n\nTouch is not ALWAYS utilized but its pretty regular - normal appearing healthy skin has a copy and paste. Theyre not gonna jam a finger in a gaping wound and ask if that hurt.\n\nIn this case, it would be important to note of it was rock solid, jelly filled balloon like, idk maybe they were checking how it reacted afterwards - did it compress and stay compressed / did it cause tearing of the skin something.\n\nClearly its been stuck for a while. The reason its important to note how long you've had an erection without being able to get it down is because your flesh starts dying after several hours of being unusually engorged. The only fixes are cut item off before the penis dies or chop the whole dick off.",

After reading some of these funny comments, i have one to add....\n\nThe guy was abducted by aliens who, tired of probing the humans they abduct, decided to change up their routine a bit. And while they are trying to figure out how to really mess with this guy, one of the mechanics walks by complaining about having a metal ring that is far to small to replace a worn part. One of the aliens calls out to the mechanic and asks him to come here. The mechanic walks over, sees that they other aliens are trying to really mess with the human and holds out the metal ring to the other aliens. They all start to laugh, slip the ring around his balls and penis then one of them injects some substance just above the ring until the guy is in the situation shown in the video.\nNow of course no one is going to believe he was abducted because everyone knows that if you get abducted you end up being probed and possibly some small FU from the aliens implanted somewhere in their body! \nSo now the aliens are observing what is going on with this guy from their ship in orbit and are laughing their asses (if they habe asses that is) off!",

The part of the story that is pertinent to this video is that he decided to remove the ring, but it was rusted in place. \n\nBefore long, one guy was holding the ring with a needle nose pliers while another cut it off (the ring) with an angle grinder. \nTears we shed but no real damage. \n\nI have a feeling that our procedure was less sterile than the one in this video. \n\nGreat story for parties.
