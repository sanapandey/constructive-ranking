    "selftext": "On Saturday, the biggest protest in history of Serbia was held against a corrupt and criminal government. There are numerous evidence (chats, phone calls) about government organizing various groups to cause riots during the peaceful protest. This video shows a group of thugs ready to start attacking the protesters and police, to give pretext for police to also attack protesters. Since protest were peaceful and orderly, some kind of sound cannon/sonic weapon was used on protestors that caused them to panic and run (there are numerous video posts about this on reddit), presumably to enable the thugs to infiltrate the protest during the ensuing commotion and start the violence.\n\nFortunately, the protest organizers (students) anticipated all of this, and immediately after the thugs started with their activities, declared the protest over and ordered people to disperse, leaving the thugs alone and in that way managed to prevent complete chaos.\n\nThe criminal leader and mastermind of this government is called Aleksandar Vucic. He is supported by the US, EU, UK, Russia and China. We, the people of Serbia, are trying to raise awareness about the criminal activities and propaganda strongold that he has created on this nation. If you are able, ask your leaders not to support this psychopath.",

This was an obvious provocation with a goal to provoke a violent response from the protesters (most likely using some infiltrated elements) against \u0106aci. \n\nOn the day of the protests authorities inserted a number of hooligans (seen on the above image) into the camp that were probably intended to burst out of the camp during the protest (most likely during the 15 min of silence) and cause major conflict with the protesters. \nBut the organizers moved the main event to a different and much larger square a few hours before, robbing the hooligans of their target. The authorities were not able to adapt quickly enough and the protest concluded with minor incidents and the supposed attack using a sound cannon that caused some limited mass panic. The hooligans tried to provoke a minor crowd by throwing rocks. But the student organizers quickly dispersed the protest and prevented escalation.\n\nThe authorities made a convoluted plan to cause violence, blame it on the students, trying to  discredit them. But were outsmarted and got the largest protest Serbia has ever seen with no act of violence. Just imagine the self control of several hundreds of thousands of people.",
