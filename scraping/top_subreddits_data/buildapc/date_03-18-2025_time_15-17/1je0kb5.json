Prices could be different in your case, I'm in Czechia, so hardware here tends to be pretty cheap compared to other areas. Prices should be relatively similar though. I can't claim I'd know which CPUs to recommend, I've only gone through a couple. I don't recommend buying a new GPU if you're trying to get a cheap system.\n\n\\- RX Vega 64 (this card is insanely good, especially since it's not impossible to find one used under $100, I remember reading a couple forum posts where users claimed cyberpunk 2077 ran at even higher resolutions at 60fps with this card)  \n\\- RX 5700 XT (one step up, I've found them for around $130-150, ran Forza Horizon 4 at 60fps high in 4k)  \n\\- RX 6650 XT (similar to 5700 XT, newer, might be a little more expensive)  \n\\- RTX 3070 (a bit more performance than the previous cards at a higher price. Mine cost around $270)\n\nYou could probably consider some of the new Intel cards if you want to buy a new GPU, but I haven't  tested them so don't know.",
