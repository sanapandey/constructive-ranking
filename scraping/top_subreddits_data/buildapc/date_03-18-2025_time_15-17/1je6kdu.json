So not it is not worth it.\n\nIf you intend to use an X3D chip, the whole point of the extra cache is to make up for slow ram so; No it is not worth it.",

            "body": "The performance difference between DDR5 CL26 and CL30 RAM at 6000 MHz is minimal in real-world applications. You're looking at approximately 1.33 nanoseconds faster response time with the CL26, which translates to very modest gains of 0-5% in gaming and 1-3% in productivity tasks. \n\nFor most users, this small improvement doesn't justify the $100 premium. You'd get better overall performance by investing that extra money elsewhere in your system, such as upgrading your GPU, CPU, or storage. Unless you're an extreme competitive gamer or running specialized memory-sensitive workloads, the CL30 at $80 offers significantly better value.\n\nEdit: I must add that most of the time the perceived gains are lost when you factor in other system bottlenecks. Even with the lower latency RAM, you'll likely be limited by your GPU in games, your storage speed in file operations, or your CPU in most productivity tasks.",
