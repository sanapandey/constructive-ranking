    "selftext": "I've built a couple of PCs ages ago, and back then most cases followed the same ideas:\n\n- stop dust from getting in with solid side and top panels,\n- have a few predefined spots for fans,\n- favor front-to-back airflow, because the bottom is usually quite covered (case sitting on a table or floor),\n- add dust filters to the few intake spots, and\n- have more air coming in than out, creating high pressure and further preventing dust from getting in.\n\nNow when I look at some \"top 5 matx cases\" they all have dozens of holes and mesh in them; the likes of Lian Li A3, Jonsbo Z20, Asus Prime AP201, etc.\n\nAlso a huge number of cases now place the PSU to the front to minimize the case height, but then they have main intake fans at the bottom of the case?\n\nWhat's going on, what should a boomer like me do? I just want a small (short in height) case that's quiet and keeps the temps low, I don't care about looks as much.",

            "body": "To answer your question, trends and priorities have changed, that's about it. The good news is, if you prefer a more old-school design, there are plenty of those still around.\n\nI was a bit hesitant about some of the newer designs as well, but like them for the most part, like the all-round mesh and bottom-mounted case fans. I still dislike the front-mounted PSU, however.\n\nLet's look at the ASUS Prime as an example:\n\n - The all-round mesh makes for plenty of air flow, which isn't bad. Remember, even back in the days, if people had some serious problem with cooling, you'd often just take the side panel off as a temporary solution. With all-round mesh, this temporary solution basically becomes permanent. Sure, you have no dust filters, but let's be honest: even _with_ dust filters, computers needed a regular cleaning.\n - The bottom-mounted fans? Well, hot air rises and most people install their AIO radiator and fans at the top of the case, so you can get a nice bottom-to-top air-flow that passes by every single component on its way. Kinda makes sense. \n - The front-mounted PSU, as you've correctly identified, is to keep the cases lower in height. And while that's logistically convenient, I dislike it for three reasons. One, depending on model, the power extension cable will hardly fit and experience quite a bend. Two, if you spill a bit of drink over the case, it will go straight into the PSU. Third, you can't reach the PSU's power switch (and possibly other controls) without opening the fan.\n\nOverall, I think it still makes for a great case with more benefits than downsides. But that's ultimately up for you to decide - depends on your tastes and priorities.",

If space is that restricted will you have proper air flow?  Last few times I built I went with ATX.  It seemed to me there was a lot more choice when it came to MBs for ATX.  The case height between an mATX and ATX tower did not seem to be substantial.  There's a lot of ATX cases that are much lighter than what we had 20 years ago.\n\nI have noticed some of those cases that reduce height with an upfront power supply location, increase depth.  Something to watch out for.\n\nIt does seem case has design has changed with focus on cooling and minimizing noise by having large quiet fans, and large CPU air coolers with large fans.  (Large fans that can minimize noise)  Choose your fans and cooler carefully.",

Most cases are on desk these days so bottom fans aren't really an issue.  AIO also helps in that optimal airflow isn't really needed anymore, and so mesh is used in place of proper exhaust.  All this in lieu of HDD and front panel drive bays but no one uses those now.  \n\n\nAnd people like this configuration which is why they are getting popular and are now even spreading to larger cases.  \n\n\nI got a SAMA IM01 Pro recently and it's really nice that I have so many options for mounting fans and disk drives, while being very compact despite it takes a MATX MB.
