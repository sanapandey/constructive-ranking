    "selftext": "I've been looking at various monitors in my price range and the choice came down to two: Asus TUF VG27AQ3A or Dell G2724D. \n\nTo give a bit of context, the price difference is around 10e, I am playing some competetive shooters a lot, but also looking into playing newer single player games and I am pairing this with a RX 7900 XT. Thanks for the help guys!",
