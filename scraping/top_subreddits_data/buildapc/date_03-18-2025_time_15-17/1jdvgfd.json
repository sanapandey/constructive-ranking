            "body": "I'm pretty sure my motherboard (Gigabyte GA-970A-D3P) can only do ddr3 memory. I'm wondering what the best option would be for upgrading just ram. I currently have G.Skill Ares 8 GB (2 x 4 GB) DDR3-1866 CL9. Would i need to ditch my current ram sticks if i bought more? Should I be aiming for 16 or 32 GB? I don't really understand speed or the two types of latency, and i heard having too many sticks could slow stuff down. My CPU is AMD FX(tm)-8350 4000 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s) (FD8350FRW8KHK) if that matters. I'm just not sure what to look for. Thanks for any help.",

                    "body": "To upgrade your ram you don't need to throw away your old sticks. You just need to make sure the new ram matches up with the old one.\n\nFor example if you have 1.5V 8gb 1600 CL9-9-9-24 ram, you need to make sure whatever ram stick you buy is also 8gb, 1600mhz, 1.5v, and has exact CL9-9-9-24 timings.\n\n>16 or 32?\n\n16 is the most you should aim for with your CPU. 32gb would be too much as your CPU is a bit old would slow down before you can fill up that capacity. In most situations the extra ram from 32gb would not help.\n\n\n>Speeds and latency?\n\nSpeed and latency are sort of tied together but generally the gist of things is more speed = more peformance. You see modern ddr5 kits having like 6400 speed but way slower CL30 latency meanwhile DDR3 is like CL9 but ends up being slower. However lower latency can help in some applications, less so in games.\n\n>Would my CPU be overwhelmed from too much ram?\n\nYes, you will probably not be able to run 1833 on 4 sticks and that will cause instability. This is simply due to a limitation on the memory controller of your CPU. But the solution is simply to try to run the ram at a lower speed and configure the speeds and timings. For example your ram is 1833, if you were to get more sticks you should downclock to 1600 or lower to see if they work at 4 sticks.",

They can't cool the GPU themselves because their flow is not really meeting the GPU radiator much, if at all, so all they can do it put the cool air there and let the GPU fans use it.\n\nI have a shroud mod on my GPU so the radiator is completely exposed and with the GPU fans to zero the difference between front fans at idle speed (40%) and 100% is something like 1-2c. With the shroud on there'd be probably no discernible difference.\n\nIf you want to optimize things see if you can hook up your bottom front fan to a separate header and make a custom curve for it tying it to the GPU temp, so it works together with the GPU fans. Your observation that the GPU basically splits the case into its own chamber is spot on and it's logical to optimize that \"chamber\" differently from the CPU \"chamber\".",

I should be fine obviously right? I also just decided to go ahead and use the 16 pin Corsair cable over the adapter and everything seems fine... Might borrow the FLIR gun from work to double check but I don't really see the need to use the adapter over the 600w cable. Hopefully there's no issues but kinda is what it is I guess, I hope running it at 517 watts instead of 575 will help, but that's about all I can do I guess. Might tinker with a actual undervolt eventually.\n\nThe card runs great, was getting around 100 fps with dlss quality at 7680x2160 in MH wilds.",

Those chips are also getting increasingly harder to find, so the used market may be your only option for them. Not ideal. \n\n* That Microcenter bundle is also pretty lackluster, as far as their bundles are concerned.

You can [put together a similar list for the same price](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wrJcHW) with better memory. Is it overkill?
