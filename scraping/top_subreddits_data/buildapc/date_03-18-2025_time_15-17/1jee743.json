    "selftext": "\nMy GPU choice is down to these two pending availability. I\u2019m not in a rush so willing to wait until I can snag either one of these two. My use case is obviously gaming, as well as music production, photo/ video editing, 3D printing/ model building and just having a powerful AI PC. My specific question is with my wife being a designer, will I be missing out on any functionality if getting the 9070XT seeing as they may be more readily available vs the 5080 if I\u2019m hoping to help her in rendering large files that her MacBook Pro struggles with? Any insight into performance differences in regards to the creator space? Should I prioritize the 5080 for best functionality (blender 3D models/ animations and large illustrator files mainly) or would the 9070XT still be just fine/ improved performance over what she may struggle with? So far have the Ryzen 9 9900 and am planning 64GB of ram if that provides any context",

You would need to see what works best with the specific programs being used. \n\n5080 is significantly more powerful in general, too.\n\nIt mostly depends on your budget and cost of the GPUs. 5080 is certainly the better option if you can afford it.",
