It feels like the number of cards they would need to release would be so incredibly high to drive the market prices down. OR you have to constantly monitor the internet and use tracking services to try and snag something close to MSRP. The time and effort to **MAYBE** save a few hundred dollars over the next half a year is up to you.",

Even the VRAM doesn't matter as full PT costs the GPU 12gb VRAM max with DLSS Performance at 4k, which is perfectly usable now with the new Transformer model updates. So you seem to be coping a bit.\n\nHowever, the 5070 Ti overclocks nicely too, also has 16gb VRAM and MFG and is obviously the better value, so not a bad purchase at all.\n\nThe higher you go - the less value you get. I got myself a 5080 as I had no budget but didn't want to spend 5k USD on a GPU. The 5080 was bad value but it was the best there is for a \"reasonable\" amount of money.

Source: Daniel Owen review.\n\n7800XT is pretty bad example of good value. As FSR3 is unusable and upscaling is worth between 1.5x and 2x times performance depending on a game. So going by this train of thought 4060 with DLSS vs 7800XT native, the former will be much faster (with DLSS Quality about 1.5x performance of 7800XT native) at half the price.\n\nFor me 2x FG is enough, any higher I start to see issues and you still get some latency hit.\n\nBest value can mean multiple thing depending on the person. To me 5080 doesn\u2019t offer different experience from the 5070Ti at 1440p and even at 4K, you would need to jump to 5090 for that. Therefore to me 5080 equals worse value than 5070Ti even for 4K.\n\nAgree to disagree.",

Source: me, not a random Youtuber.\n\n4xMFG lets me run Cyberpunk with PT and everything on Max at 200+ average fps and it honestly doesn't feel bad at all to me.\n\nAnd I'll say it again - 5070 Ti IS the better value - both at the current absurd prices AND forever. The lower you get - the better the value is, unless you are limited by features and VRAM for your desired needs. And yes, if you do need just raster performance, the 7800XT is almost twice the value of the 5070 Ti.\n\nThe 5080 is a really bad value card right now and I already agreed, so I have no idea what the hell are you agreeing to disagreeing with. I just said that spending 1800 or 1400 USD with VAT for either card is all the same to me. But spending almost 4000 USD, even though I have them readily available, is not something I'm willing to spend on a GPU. So the 5080 was the best I could get at a \"decent\" price, literally half that of the next best thing, value for money aside.",

For 5080 the cheapest I had one available to me was an Asus Astral 5080 OC for $1649.99 (Newegg). I didn't think the extra $649.99 would of been worth it to me so I went with the 5070Ti OC and it overclocks great and runs cool and quiet. I'm happy with it coming from a 3080Ti OC for 4k gaming.
