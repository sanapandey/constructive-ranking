    "selftext": "Good afternoon.  To keep it short, I have a 2070 super in my PC and I recently upgraded the wife's PC from a 1660 to a 4060 ti.  Her PC was a prebuilt, so the wiring is a bit wild.  The goal was to swap the 2070 super to her PC and take the 4060 ti for mine (selfish, I know).\n\nThe main problem I'm running into is the 2070 super uses an 8 pin and a 6 pin connector, while the 4060 ti only uses an 8 pin.  The power supply isn't modular, and i can't find the 6 pin connector anywhere.\n\nSo my question, is it worth taking apart her PC to find the 6 pin so that the 2070 super works in her PC or is the performance to effort required ratio not high enough for me to perform surgery on the thing.",
