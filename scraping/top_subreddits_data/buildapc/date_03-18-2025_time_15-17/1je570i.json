Insane level of details, to the point it's actually useless for your average user :(\n27minutes of video and we still don't know how much fps we could expect from the 9070, or how high we could turn the settings for a stable 90fps.\n\nI have a brand new 5700x3d and don't plan on changing it (would need to change CPU-ram-mb, no thanks). AMD looks like a bad match to my setup.\n\nThanks for your answer, possibly a downgrade is what I fear. It's insane that the only worthy upgrade I can take is $1000 and up (5070ti)",

In raster games I expect the 9070 is just generally faster with a bigger gap the higher the resolution. 9070 will have much better longevity because of the extra VRAM, but performance-wise the two cards are pretty close.",
