    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI want to share one of the worst PC-building experiences I've ever had, involving a faulty PSU, a nightmare customer service experience, and an agonizing wait to finally use my RTX 5080 MSI Gaming Trio.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever struggled with a PC build or are considering buying a RTX 5000 series GPU, this might be worth reading.\n\n\n---\n\nEverything started well\u2026 or so I thought\n\nIn November 2024, I decided to build my dream setup, including:\n\nMSI RTX 5080 Gaming Trio\n\nMSI X670E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nBe Quiet! Pure Power 12 M 1000W (ATX 3.0, 12VHPWR compatible)\n\n\nI thought everything would be fine compatibility-wise, and like any PC enthusiast, I was excited to build my system and enjoy top-tier performance.\n\nBut that\u2019s when everything went to hell.\n\n\n---\n\nThe PSU that ruined everything\n\nAs soon as I finished assembling my setup, my RTX 5080 wouldn't power on.\nThe PC booted, but there was no video signal, and the GPU remained completely unresponsive.\nAt first, I thought: \"Damn, maybe my graphics card is faulty.\"\n\nI ran every test possible:\n\nTried different PCIe slots\n\nChecked the 12VHPWR cable connection\n\nReset BIOS, CMOS\u2014nothing worked.\n\n\nEventually, I concluded: \"Okay, my GPU must be defective.\"\nSo I contacted Materiel.net\u2019s support (where I purchased the card) and sent it back for RMA on March 8th.\n\n\n---\n\nStill doubting, I bought a new motherboard\n\nWhile my RTX 5080 was being checked by the RMA team, doubt started eating away at me.\nI wondered if the issue was actually my MSI X670E Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, so I decided to buy a new one, a MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi, in case the motherboard was the real problem.\n\nIt arrived quickly, way faster than the PSU I\u2019m still waiting for today\u2026 (but we\u2019ll get to that later).\n\nI reassembled everything full of hope, but\u2026 still nothing.\n\n\n---\n\nA few days after sending the RTX 5080, I finally get a crucial idea\u2026 too late\n\nA few days after shipping my RTX 5080 for RMA, I finally thought, \"What if I test a different graphics card and power supply?\"\nI borrowed a RX 5700 XT and another power supply from my brother, and guess what?\n\nWith his PSU, everything worked fine.\n\nWith my Be Quiet! PSU, still no PCIe power.\n\n\nSo my PSU was the problem all along!\nAnd just like that, I had wasted weeks, bought a new motherboard for no reason, and sent my RTX 5080 for RMA when it was perfectly fine.\n\n\n---\n\nThe X670E motherboard becomes useless\n\nAfter installing my MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi, I realized it was never my motherboard\u2019s fault.\nSo now, my X670E motherboard, which I suspected for no reason, is useless.\nI\u2019ll be reselling it as second-hand gear since I strongly prefer the X870E.\n\n\n---\n\nThe battle with 1foDiscount\n\nI contacted 1foDiscount (where I bought my PSU) to request a refund, but of course, they tried every trick to get out of it.\n\nThey told me the 14-day return period was over (even though legal warranty laws cover defects for 2 years).\n\nThey asked for detailed tests (which I had already done).\n\nThey insisted that I ship back the PSU, but with no guarantee of a refund.\n\n\nI sent them detailed emails, quoted consumer protection laws, and made it clear that I was ready to report them to consumer authorities if they refused to comply.\nStill, nothing moved.\n\n\n---\n\nAnd now, the endless wait for a new PSU\n\nSince I had no working PC and 1foDiscount was stalling, I ordered a new PSU from Amazon.\nBut once again, the nightmare continued:\n\nDelivery delayed multiple times\n\nPackage stuck in a logistics warehouse since March 16th\n\nAmazon support saying it \u201cshould\u201d arrive tomorrow\u2026 but without a clear confirmation\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m exhausted.\nI have a brand-new RTX 5080 waiting, a beast of a system, but everything is being held up by one damn power supply.\n\n\n---\n\nWhy am I sharing this?\n\nFirst, because I need to let it out, obviously.\nBut also because I know I\u2019m not the only one struggling with RTX 5000 series builds, PSU issues, and 12VHPWR cables.\n\nIf anyone here has experienced similar PSU problems or has tips on avoiding issues with 12VHPWR, I\u2019d love to hear them.\n\nAnd most importantly, if you're building a system with an RTX 5000 GPU, always check your PSU before blaming the graphics card.\nI lost a whole month due to a problem that could have been solved in an hour\u2026\n\n\n---\n\nThanks to everyone who read this far. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be posting an update soon with my setup finally running!\n\nPS: I forgot to mention in the original post, but the issue seems to be with the PSU\u2019s PCIe rail. I\u2019m waiting for my new PSU to confirm 100%, but everything points to that.",

Then all you really need to get working is -\n\n\nPSU, Motherboard, CPU, RAM.\n\n\nDisks, keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc you'll know arent working seperately (or can test seperately).\n\n\nIf you really need spares and dont have friends to help and *if* it doesnt work first time then get hold of some cheap or free spares.\u00a0\n\n\nBare in mind the spares dont have to be the same spec, just *anything* that works in most cases. It might be harder to do this in your region I dont know, but most places you can pick up spares for free or next to free providing you arent really interested in their spec. Non-modular power supplies for example are thrown away every day in NA/Europe.\n\n\nYou might not have friends or family who'll let you use their good stuff, but I bet you know people who have old stuff lying around they dont want if you ask.\n\n\nOnce you have some old spares, PC diagnostics is a _much_ easier game and always your best approach.",

ROG's support wasn't much of help with that; I had strange issues, wherein when I would turn off the PC, it would exit windows, but it would not shut off(fans/processor would remain on). I took it to a local popular PC store over here to inspect my setup. He 'concluded' that the motherboard was faulty, he fried a motherboard too during the process. He got everything working outside the case, but as soon as he snapped into the case, it stopped working. Later it turned out to be my case! the standoff screws were pre-installed by the shop I got it from incorrectly, leading to the motherboard touching the case and shorting out. I felt bad for the shop, but to be honest, for a first built, it gave me the confidence to continue, because the supposedly skilled workers destroyed one too.\n\nAt the end, I ended up buying a new motherboard and a case from the same shop, completely defeating my saving strategy of buying items online on Blackfriday/Cyber Monday events.\n\nTough lesson, but I guess I've learnt a good one.",

I went through the whole \"need me the quietest PSU I can get\" process and realized that as long as it was below X dB then really the top concern needed to be: Is it owned and used by a lot of people?  As in... a large proportion of the entire PC building community?\n\nAgain, not shilling.  Hell, I've had ram fail on me only twice in several decades and both times it was the only two times I bought Corsair.  I don't even think they actually make their PSUs.  But their PSUs are good enough and, more importantly, widely used.  If a problem surfaces with one of their PSUs, chances are _extremely good_ you're not going to be the guy who discovers it firsthand.  That's a philosophy I apply to any standardized PC part, too: Mass ownership is crucial.",

If the PSU was at fault somehow, why do you say \"if you're building a system with an RTX 5000\"? If the PSU is at fault, it would be the PSU regardless of which card you have...?",
