I'll keep adding reviews throughout the day and do a full sweep once I'm home from the office._\n\nOh boy, overlapping review and release embargos! Aren't we all lucky?!\n\nReviews for the [RTX 5070](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5070-family/) come out March 4th with a release date of March 5th. AMD lags behind a day for each with the reviews dropping on the 5th for the [RX 9070](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/9000-series/amd-radeon-rx-9070.html) and [RX 9070 XT](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/9000-series/amd-radeon-rx-9070xt.html) and releasing on the 6th. \n\nDo give us some space while we work to update the thread with reviews, there's gonna be a lot to jump on top of. \n\n#  Nvidia Card Specs\n\n| Spec | RTX 4070 | RTX 4070 Super | **RTX 5070** | RTX 5070 Ti | \n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **GPU Core** | AD104 | AD104 |

Currently, the 5070 Ti has almost no availability at MSRP, with Newegg and Amazon selling out of cards priced at $1000 (plus tax) instantly and still ending up on FB Marketplace or eBay with reseller profit to spare.\n\nThe reference 5070 board is $550 (no FE), and the other 5000 series have seen factory OC cards go for 30% premiums while the MSRP and FE models are hard to find. With the likely scant availability of retail 5070s, and Trump threatening across the board tariffs on Chinese imports (assuming he after market parts are assembled in China), retail prices will easily cross $750. Add in tax, plus the cost of time to get one, and you're kind of stuck between waiting for hours in the cold or giving a scalper $1000.",

But PC building is a bit of a niche hobby.  Sure, it has grown over the years, but I don't think PC building is mainstream *enough* to see this typical exertion by \"average\" or \"casual\" users.\n\nI think it's fair to ask who is buying all the stock, but I also don't think there's much stock, to begin with.  If a retail store gets three cards and sells them, then there's not much reason to stress about the cards getting sold because the supply is so limited.\n\nPower-users and enthusiasts are the most likely non-scalping demographic to buy these cards at launch, but that same group *should* be the most plugged-in and knowledgeable group and would, at least theoretically, know to avoid a bad product.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong and times have shifted, and the \"general public\" is extremely invested in GPU launches.  I'm just not sure that's the case, especially since the cards take up such a small minority of actual PC builds (according to Steam).\n\nTL;DR: I think it's less about \"who\" is buying stock and more about low stock/limited supply creating a false perception of extreme demand.",

There are zero features Nvidia has outside of a professional setting that can ever make up that price difference.\n\nOk, so what should be happening at this point is that you stop for a moment and reconsider that *maybe* your evaluation of the situation isn't quite aligned with reality. When your argument starts to require the vast majority of people to act irrationally in order to remain valid, it's very often more likely that it is actually the argument which is flawed.\n\nIn this case, you have both over-exaggerated the real-world price/performance differences, and heavily undersold the perceived value of those exclusive features based on your own bias. \n\nIt doesn't really cost any less for AMD to produce these cards. They simply have to take that hit to their overall margins because the reality is that the products are *not* equivalent, and if they tried to price them just based on average raster performance, their share of the GPU pie would start to look more like Intel's. \n\nNvidia ironically ends up kind of stuck \"overpricing\" their product stack because the inverse is true as well - if a 9070 XT is available at $599 and a 5070 Ti is $649, how many people do you think would still be eyeing the 9070 XT? How about if the 5070 Ti were $599 as well? They can't do either of those things of course, because they *need* AMD to retain at least some semblance of competitiveness to avoid the nasty potential side effects like being forced to break up the business from an antitrust suit. So we get that lovely 5070 at $549, with somewhat more modest \"raw\" raster performance numbers, and enough of a sprinkling of VRAM anxiety on the enthusiast side to drive some up to the Ti, and others towards AMD.",

The symptons are extremely frustrating to deal with. Unless I set texture and other VRAM heavy settings low then I'll get major stutters which takes minutes of waiting or restarting the game to stop, not even lowering the settings will fix it immediately after it starts. Happens a lot when entering new areas in games too. Playing in 4k just to use low textures wasn't a good experience. \n\nI originally planned to buy the 5080, but moved down to the 5070 TI based on price and expected performance considering they both had 16gb VRAM. I managed to get an OC model card \u00a3739 (\u00a310 over MSRP) and got \u00a3400 back from my old card.",

Its not a true-blue 4k card at all. It can do it. But there are some sacrifices to be made. \n\nI cant justify spending a further 100$ for a card when $499 was already pushing it for me.\n\nThe gpu market has went and lost its damned mind.

I know 1440p is very mainstream now and 4K is getting more popular, but we still have to admit that if a card can play your games on 4K, it is NOT an entry level GPU.   \nI personally still play on 1080p because I prioritize matching my refresh rate (165Hz) over resolution. My old GTX 1070 has been struggling for a couple of years now and I am finally looking for a replacement. I already replaced my platform from an old i7 6700K to a new Ryzen 9 7900 some time ago, but I didn't have the budget left to replace my GPU at that point. I am really thinking of getting the RX 9070 XT now, especially when I'm gaming on Linux which is still smoother on AMD.  \n\nThe point is, we've got to establish what \"entry\" means and thankfully the definition is very clear. An entry level GPU lets you dip your toes in gaming, not really max every setting out. It usually means 1080p or 1440p on low-medium settings. That's what 50 class cards are for, not 70. If 70 was entry, then what would 50 and 60 even be? They can game, just not on 4K and 1440p max settings, and that's why they are entry-level. \n\nBut to be clear, I am not arguing that the pricing is good. My GTX 1070 back in the day was like $380 MSRP. Nvidia as a company has grown it's stock price A HUNDRED TIMES since 2016 yet the MSRP for 70 class cards went up to the level of 550-600. There is nothing more to this price than corporate greed and the fact that the market already accepted the price so nvidia and AMD can do that as long as people are willing to pay. It is still an issue.",

But it won't matter if people can't get the card at anywhere near MSRP, which has been the trend lately. The 9070XT is a good buy at $600 price point if you want to get performance that approaches top tier of last gen - the closer the price point gets to XTX MSRP, the less sense it makes to buy this card. And I'm honestly expecting the market to do the same thing with this card that happened with the 50 series launch.

It's honestly just how I expect it to play out. There is very high demand because of the poor 50 series launch and while this one may go more smoothly, I just find it hard to believe there will be enough stock to meet built up demand. On top of that and the tariffs you already mentioned, AMD is not producing a FE for this gen so we are now relying on AIBs to actually sell at AMD's MSRP - not a good bet IMO.\n\nIf people are able to get the cards at $600 I will be surprised but happy for them. The XTX I bought still won't be worse than the 9070 XT and I am still planning to sell my 3070, a step I haven't taken in the past, which will shrink the cost differential.",

If you intend on staying on 1080p or 1440p then there is no need to pay double for performance you will likely not be able to notice on standard resolutions.  \nJust wait for the RX 9070 XT reviews for now and really rethink if you value 4K gaming or not. If not then the cheaper option will most likely be the best answer.   \nIf you have a 1080 then the only assumption I can make is that you don't already own a good 4K display (correct me if I'm wrong of course) and that's also adding to the price of utilizing the 5080 to it's full capacity.",

Are we talking 60-70, 100, or 144? Also a lot depends on your monitor's resolution.\n\n\nAnd yeah. People on this sub like to advocate for amd gpu even though for most people they are just not worth it over nvidia.\n\n\nI'd say wait for 9070 (xt) reviews and see how the market reacts. If the cards are actually great and can be bought for msrp, then you vould get the xt. Or maybe if the 9070 sells like crazy nvidia will have to lower the prices for 5070 and or 5070 ti or wrap up production of all 50 series cards. Nvidia can afford dropping the prices below floor level",

The 4070Ti was \"numbered\" wrong since it surpassed a 3090 in most cases!\n\nMoore's Law is a thing and you're simply **not** going to see massive generational gains any more in pure raster performance.  GPU technology has pretty much matured and there's hard limits on reducing node size and the gains that will come.\n\nAMD is \"catching up\" by leveraging larger on-die caches, like Lovelace, but times change and the expectation of huge generational gains is no longer reasonable.  Think of it in the same context as gas mileage in cars; since the 1970's they made enormous strides with fuel injection and software-controlled engines, but you hit a hard limit where gasoline-based efficiency gains are now quite small and there's very little margin to get any more.",
