    "selftext": "How much would you need to save to feel comfortable buying a used CPU? I'm looking into buying either a 7800X3D or 9800X3D. Saw a few 7800X3D on marketplace for $350. But I'm not convinced that $90 is enough to risk buying used with no warranty from a stranger. How much would you pay? \ud83e\udd14\n\nI just got a new RX 9070XT and my old Ryzen 7 5800X is holding me back. \n\nEdit: I'm sure I could negotiate a few extra dollars but I'm not sure about how much less to offer without being unreasonable.

Not all eBay sellers use that, some won't accept returns (though they will be forced to if item doesn't match description). If such a cpu passes stress tests it's easy to say it'll likely last and be okay. For a new build, it makes diagnosing much more difficult as it could be cpu, memory, mb, etc.",
