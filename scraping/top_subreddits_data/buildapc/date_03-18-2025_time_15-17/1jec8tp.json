Looking for upgrade to am5 either 9800x3d or 9950x3d the mb is b650 tomahawk. \nMy question is will 9800x3d be enough for my daily use(csgo,recording using medal web discord and some small Chinese game on the side plus streaming use obs the same time) \nMy gpu is 4070s\nSorry for my grammar ",

You have a pretty well balanced system, that cpu is fast enough to handle your gpu. \n\n9950x3d is insanely overkill for general use and gaming. It only makes sense for people who have heavy production workloads who also love gaming. That\u2019s not you. 9800x3d is enough, and overkill in your case.",

It goes 260-120 fps and currently I\u2019m using 240hz monitors and I can see the screen lag and the 9800x3d holds the fps above 400 and stable (saw it on youtube) if 5900x hold the fps high and stable above 240 then I won\u2019t think about swap it out",

I would upgrade to 32gb and see if it helps. \n\nI\u2019m surprised you have frame dip issues. I have a very similar system - same gpu, but 5700x cpu, and have very smooth performance when gaming. I have no complaints.",

I honestly don\u2019t know what the issue could be since there could be so many things that might cause your issue, but I\u2019d start with updating drivers, updating windows, making sure that Resizeable BAR (above 4g encoding) is enabled in the BIOS and monitoring cpu and gpu usage using something like msi afterburner that shows cpu and gpu utilization. Hell, it might just be settings in the game.",

(Be nice to the people at your local shop)\n\nFor gaming, the 9800x3d is fine, for some workloads also just fine. I just got it because I am working on training videos for work and need the extra horsepower.\n\nIts the scenario you mentioned about streaming OBS + Gaming that you may want or need a 9950x3d. I'm guessing you use NVenc for the encoding of the stream but OBS will def take CPU resources so for max gaming and ability to stream I'd get the 9950x3d. You'll have to get familiar with how the different CCD's work but you should be fine. If you dont mind a lil bit of performance loss while streaming just save the money and get the 9800x3d.\n\nIf you are in NorCal let me know, there are local shops with 9950x3d in stock and OEM is $20 off.",

Even my freeware apps like Gyroflow (for action cam video stabilization) even use full GPU acceleration and the CPU just sits there like 7% usage barely doing shit even with eight windows/instances of Gyroflow rendering... High core count for video editing is a waste of time anymore when the GPU does the work... Only time I see a benefit with a 16core CPU is say shader compilation in games or unzipping a large zip file for example but video editing is pretty much 100% GPU these days...",

It'll still be an improvement over the 5900x (roughly 18% in applications, 23% in 1080p gaming)",
