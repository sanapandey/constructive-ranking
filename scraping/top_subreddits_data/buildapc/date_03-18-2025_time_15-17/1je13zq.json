However, you can get one for much less $$. The only nvidia cards id even consider buying, these days, are the 5080 and 5090 and only because amd doesnt have a competing card\u2026..yet. Give it another generation or 2 and i predict amd will overtake nvidia altogether because, while amd is constantly innovating and improving their architecture, nvidia prefers to simply produce fake frames and then sharpen the hell out of them.\nAll that said, in response to OP, id go with the 9800x3d and 4070 super over the other combo, if youre absolutely stuck on nvidia. However, of the games you listed, several of them run better on the 9070xt than even the 5070ti. Black myth isnt one of them, though. I do believe there will be either a game or driver optimization that will fix this soon but, for now, black myth runs worse on the amd card.",

Perfect combo in my opinion. 9800 X3D will future proof the system for a longer period of time and anyway 5070 Ti is considered lower in performance compares to 4070 Ti Super (until and unless you want DLSS4). \n\n4070 Ti Super is also considered better than the 4080 Ti in some specific scenarios. So yeah I think you should go for this combo.",

Again I think you should only buy 50 series if you want the extra generated fps. Because the price to performance ratio of these series is really skeptical. \n\nExample: Games like RDR2 and Cyberpunk 2077 on Ultra 1440p performs almost same on both the cards differencing between 4-16 FPS. \n\nGiving 20K to 30K for extra 15 FPS (which is also not in all the games) I don't consider fair. You can put the difference amount in CPU which is something that if you would to upgrade you will need to have a completely new motherboard if the architecture changes.\n\nPriotize future proofing the CPU, I would suggest.",
