    "selftext": "I'm upgrading from a 3070ti, mostly due to the unfortunate 8GB VRAM. Budget isn't too much of a concern, so the price gap doesn't bother me much(its only about $30 usd between them here). My main concern about the 9070XT is the lack of FSR4 support, I've tried using FSR3 a bit and it just isn't enough for me, FSR4 looks good but lacks support in a lot of titles and I'm not sure how many older titles are going to update to get it. Going Nvidia seems a bit worrying to me though, from what I've read on the various PC subreddits here, I'm taking a massive gamble on having missing ROPS and the power connector is unsafe, I leave my PC idle often when I'm not home so that is a concern for me.   I'm pairing whatever I get with a R7 5800x.",

RTX HDR is godsend also if you have an hdr monitor.\n\nI could not care less about ray tracing. Motion fluidity (aka fps) is far more important to me than \"realistic\" lights.

One of those is completely proprietary to 1 vendor, the other one isn't. I will always support a solution for all gamers (like fsr or xess) over a prorpietary one that a monopoly has. DLSS is not even much better vs FSR4.\n\n>There are clearly people that care about it and if you can have better RT performance for the same price why not go for it?\n\nAt the same price? Sure, go for it. If these cards were at MSRP (meaning, a 25% price difference) then no. I wouldn't spend $150 for an effect that will eat up half of my frames for \"realistic\" lights in a handful of games I'll play.",

AMD's FSR 4 is on par with Nvidia's DLSS in performance but DLSS is way more widely available. The 5070 Ti is a more energy efficient card although AMD has closed the gap this generation.\n\nIf you care only about raster performance, buy whichever card is cheaper.\n\nIf you care about ray tracing performance, buy the 5070 Ti unless you can get the 9070 XT for 20-30% less AND you can stomach 20-30% less ray tracing performance.\n\nI personally bought the 9070 XT because it was available to purchase (5070 Ti was not) and I was able to get it near MSRP leading to at least a 20% price difference.",
