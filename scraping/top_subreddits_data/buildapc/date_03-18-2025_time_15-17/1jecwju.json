    "selftext": "Before anything, I just want to say that I'm just an average gamer and not an enthusiast or a min-max builder.  \n  \nMy current build (since 2019):  \nMobo: ROG Strix x570  \nCPU: Ryzen 7 3700x (will be replacing this one soon, don't know which one yet as much as possible don't want to buy a new MOBO yet)  \nGPU: Asus Strix RTX 2070 Super  \nG.skill Trident 2 x 16 GB of DDR 4 3600 CL16  \nPSU: Corsair RM850x (I'm hoping this is enough)  \n  \nMy current build still runs most things fine at 1080p and lowest settings but since the release of recent games like Monster Hunter Wild and competitive games like Marvel Rising, I've noticed a significant performance drop and so I thought 5 years is good enough to retire my 2070 super. In the past I've also bought games I couldn't play (even at lowest settings without some performance issues) like the FF7 remakes and Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nI've been keeping my eyes out for a 4070 Ti Super since last Christmas but I didn't want to pay almost double the MSRP (The cheapest I've seen around the time was going for 1200). When I finally did have extra money to splurge on an upgrade, all the 4000 series were out of stock; even the amd alternatives were hard to find! I would have settled even for just a regular 4070 at that point but didn't get lucky so I thought I would just hold out until Black monday or something. That is until I was browsing newegg this weekend and saw 5070 in stock. It wasn't a Ti but for $600 something I thought I couldn't go wrong? Note that before this I didn't even think of going for a 5000 series. I was set on a 4070 Ti Super or even a 4090. But as soon as I saw that price i pulled the trigerred right away. Surely 3 generations of xx70 is an upgrade regardless of what reviewers are saying?  \n  \nWas I being too hasty? I mean a 5070 for $600 was a wiser decision than a $1300 4070 ti super? I haven't received it yet but all the videos I watched so far are shitting on the 5000 series in general (something I wish I've seen before pulling the trigger). Also since I'm an amateur builder, is there anything in my current build that I will need to replace? The PSU? The memory sticks? I already know the 3700x will be a bottle neck for it and that is something I am currently researching on what to do. Whether I just upgrade to the best the x570 is compatible with or go next gen and buy a new mobo and super high cpu depends on whether I have to replace other parts. \n\nAppreciate all the tips and insights. Also thinking of returning it if the 5070 is actually that horrible as people say and just go full 5090 in a few months",

Had I bought a 5070 Ti at MSRP which was listed around 900, with tax it goes over 1000.  You just don't include the interest when computing for these things because its like asking people if they paid for their build in full or with credit card and if they paid installment on those credit card payments.\n\nLike I know its dumb, I'm dumb, but technically it still listed at MSRP.\n\nEdit: Just to add cause I feel like even if I had cash or gotten a different card like say gave in to the $1200 GPUs, I would have still used the same mode of payment so yes it kinda really didn't matter TO ME.",

RTX 5070 is actually a capable RT card too, and it will run most of the currently popular games on Ultra 100+ FPS/1440P. Sure something like 9070 XT is clearly better value if you can get it at MSRP, but we don't live in a world where you can just waltz into a store and have your pick of cards at MSRP.",

Now, in the near future, a few games will have to have lowered graphics. That said, I really tried to stress the card yesterday -- loaded up a HUGE Unreal Engine map with RT and I could only get to 11GB VRAM. Played RE4R at 1440p with RT, DLSS, and high graphics and was getting 130-140 FPS and max VRAM of 9-10.\n\nIt's a freaking amazing card -- the only thing that sucks is the VRAM, but again, I couldn't even get any game to exceed usage.",

So if you are asking if that is a good price. It's not bad. If you are asking if the 5070 is a great card, then the answer is significantly more complicated. From a price/performance standpoint, the current AMD 9070/9070xt models are far better values. It really isn't close. But the 5070 has DLSS which is still better than the AMD tech, though the gap is closing. I just got a 9070(nonxt) and find FSR4.0 to be great where it works. Which unfortunately isn't in very many games. BG3 for instance does not support FSR4.0, though to be fair, it doesn't really need it. So my recommendation is, look at your gaming habits. Do your games support FSR3.x or 4.0? If so AMD is a good choice. If they only support DLSS, then not so much. Unless it's an older game. Some games also RT far better on Nvidia, particularly path-traced ones. So Alan Wake 2 and Black Myth Wukong and the like are FAR better on Nvidia. It's complicated. More complicated than others are making it out to be. A big point in your favor right now, is that you actually have a 5070 in hand, or on the way. If a 9070 is a better value but you can't get it, is it really better? I LOVE my 9070 and wouldn't trade it for a 5070. But the fact I actually possess it is a big part of it. I actually got it at msrp 550usd. So I'm ecstatic about that. You got yours at close-ish to msrp when most folks can't get it at any price. I'd honestly be tempted to keep it. It's not like you can just return and get a 9070xt for the same price. That would require more luck than you likely have right now.",

I was hesitant because I've never used AMD GPUs but it's been a good experience so far.
