Depends on surface material, example drive year same road&conditions white and black car. Both will be dirty, what kind of dirt is the stain depends which colour shows it easier. Still both will get dirty.\n\n\nI found black shiny PC cases harder to keep clean, it shows every fingerprint and dust easier. Of course if you have dirty hands, white case shows those stains etc. Had white NZXT Phantom case over 10years, build PC for friend in it and donated that case to him, still white, has white plastic parts. Bought it 2011. He loves it.\n\n\nNow my main PC has been in white Fractal Define 7 case ~5 years, less plastic and more matte surface white paint, it's absolutely easiest case to clean&stays clean, still as white as always. Everyone has black cases, so I found white cases to be more interesting, doesn't show dust and just more personal look, I have very dark desks and furniture, don't like - actually I hate \"every inch in room has to white\" decorations.\n\"Piano black\" is just worst, in my opinion, my second PC is in matte black Fractal case and it's as easy to keep clean as my white Fractal. Just my take, love modding PC cases and have also painted several cases(and cars), but everyone is free to like what they want. White paint might get yellow if you smoke tobacco inside, just like white... Anything. But what do I know, I'm just professional spray painter and PC tech, couple hundred finished builds done. Grey is nice PC case colour also.",

I am not buying new everything to match the case either. Though it's fine for me because I prefer black anyways (lol!)\n\nMy next case will 100% be black.
