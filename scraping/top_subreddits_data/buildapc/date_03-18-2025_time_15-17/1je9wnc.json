    "selftext": "Hey everyone. I want to upgrade the RAM on my PC to 32GB. My mini-ITX board only has 2 RAM slots so I'm looking to upgrade to a 2x16GB setup. I have been looking through several older threads and I kind of got overwhelmed between all the different options. I saw a lot of people say 3600 C16 is ideal. I also saw that the caching on the Ryzen CPU negates the need to get something so low latency, and that 3600 C18 is fine. I also saw people saying get a 3200 C16 and overclock that to 3600.\n\nIn Canada the options for DDR4 are limited (especially for RGB which isn't a _must_ but my PC has a glass display and my current ram sticks are RGB) so I just wanted to know what is actually going to give me a real life noticeable difference. My build is below.
