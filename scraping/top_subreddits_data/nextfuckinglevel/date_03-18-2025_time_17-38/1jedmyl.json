    "selftext": "This dance routine was initially filmed for the 1952 movie \"The Belle of New York,\", but after Astaire performed the dance, it was decided that his costume wasn't appropriate to his persona. They had him reshoot the entire dance again, and by viewing the footage side-by-side, his insane precision is really showcased. Absolutely incredible!",
