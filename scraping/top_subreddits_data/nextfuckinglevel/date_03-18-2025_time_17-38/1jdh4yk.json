I would guess 6ish ft.\n\nMore importantly, the bottom is going to be a mix of loose silt, mud, organic muck, sand, and whatever the local soil is like (probably clay to be able to hold the water). Even if the water is only two feet deep, you could get three steps in and find your foot sinking knee deep into the mud. Or it could be compacted sand and you could walk freely ten feet in. \n\nBut I would bet money that it's 6ish feet deep at the center and the bottom is a few inches of loose muck on top of compacted soil. Not something you could walk through. The owner probably sends someone out with a kayak, or pulls the float in to collect disks in the basket. They probably use a long rake to collect disks from the lake.",
