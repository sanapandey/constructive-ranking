I am fully aware of art & the strain that this art form puts on our bodies! Anyone who is a student or graduates is a kid to me. It's not meant to be rude & I have no clue why someone would even think I'm being rude. \n\nHere's the facts: Because of the strain on the body, & the number of injuries sustained throughout the life of someone in this form of art, many don't last for years in the performance realm & we go into teaching at a very young age. If you've been performing & teaching brilliant talent like her, she instantly becomes your child. Hence 'Kid.'\n\nNot trying to win anyone over with my explanation but it just seems that there's a lot of assumptions happening here so just wanted to provide some context. \n\nMany of our dancers get put into precarious situations for 'art.' There are less dangerous ways to achieve what we can all consider 'art.' It's unfortunate that my concern for her safety is lost on 1 word but hopefully the context will help. There's a good chance that it won't because few like to admit that there was more to it than they created an opinion on at the start. \n\nNo worries either way & I wish you well.",

Red Bull for the sport I was involved in and people I knew personally typically involved a cool setting, like an abandoned stadium with ramps added type of thing. \n\nMe personally it was more organic than that. I was in the magazines and videos and stuff, but it was more core to the sport stuff. And then later years I contributed as a creative to the magazines and videos and got to be there to document some of the best stuff happening at the time. \n\nReally fun decade or so of my life being involved with the pro level side of things. Nothing has given me the same sort of satisfaction prior or since, and probably never really will. It\u2019s really an amazing feeling pulling off something you were truly afraid of or thought you couldn\u2019t do. And also really gratifying documenting others do the same and be excited about how you made it look. \n\nBut overall I was just commenting on how it\u2019s the love of it that drives these people. Also the stuff you create lasts forever. I\u2019d imagine this ballerina is going to be proud of the photos they come away from this stunt from for the rest of her life.",

Also a rapid heart rate and blood pressure spike, which could trigger cardiac arrest. She'd need to keep her head above an control her breathing, get out of the water immediately and be cared for with blankets, tea, dry clothes and possibly medication and professional care. \n\nI'm sure there's a rescue team behind the ship, just out of sight. Otherwise this stunt would be batshit insane. It wouldn't be \"slightly dangerous\" but acutely life threatening.",

I dive into water like this pretty much every day throughout most of winter, in the mornings if I could be bothered, but pretty much every day.\n\nThe ship also appears to be stationary, more or less, if she fell she could swim like not under it, also If she were to fall in i'd say the person filming the thing 25 metres away can quite easily pick her up. I can stay in ice cold water for 10-15 minutes if I don't move too much and I am not bloody Wim Hof I can tell you that.\n\nAlso the bow is nearly 2m wide. I think a ballerina can manage a tight rope.\n\nAlso why? Because it's art. She wanted to do it. Let people have some fun. I'd do it too if I could, looks awesome.",

Kids, adults, grandmas.\n\nAlso most people could survive 15 minutes without training. After that unconsciousness is likely but you would still be alive for up to an hour. If the person in the water doesn't move too much the water around you warms up so actually you will be in 3-4 degrees (celcius) water if the current is not strong. At this temperature a human can remain conscious for 30-60 minutes and stay alive for several hours still unconscious.\n\nThe second point is that \"training\" doesn't make your body stay warmer in cold water, what you think people grow more fat or something? It's just your mental tolerance for the cold grows. Maybe there could be some mild phenomena but I doubt it.\n\nThirdly, if she fell in there is obviously a boat filming it a short distance away. So she would not be there for 15 minutes.\n\nFourthly, that may look like a thin platform to dance on, but given the ship is 147m long I believe the ice breaker is actually about 1-2 metres wide. I think a person who practices a sport which requires utterly impeccable balance and can walk a tightrope can probably manage to safely stand on a platform of that width\n\n[https://www.voyagers.travel/news/ballerina-braves-freezing-temperatures-on-cruise-ships-bulbous-bow](https://www.voyagers.travel/news/ballerina-braves-freezing-temperatures-on-cruise-ships-bulbous-bow)\n\nLastly, I would reckon that the person performing the stunt has had some ice water training.\n\nWhat is wrong with telling the truth with facts so people can understand themselves? Teaching people to fear things without understanding them just seems lazy to me.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI see you are an attention seeking troll who said the exact opposite on an earlier comment on this thread.

I ask him what he was looking at and he just asks \"How'd those geese get up there?\" \n\nI looked out the window and there were 3 geese on top of the building. \"How do you think they got up there?\" \n\n\"I don't see a ladder or geese stairs. You think someone put em up there?\" \n\nThis is when I found out my coworker didn't know geese could fly and thought they just walked around everywhere.",

It also wouldn't need a crew to help you set up and have a rescue team on site (which I hope they had for the ballerina). And depending on the photos taken when they get there, it could end up being a lame shot, regardless of it being a prime photo spot.\n\nThere are all types of photos where the photographer uses an odd technique or objects to create interesting visuals or something interperative that makes you think beyond the photo. Maybe it was simple. Maybe there's some ingenuity and experience behind it. Maybe it just ends up looking awesome. Could be cheap. Could be expensive. It's the result that matters, and what went into it can lend so much to that.\n\nThis was a matter of having a ballerina dance on a thing in a dangerous place, in front of a stunning background. At that point, all the photographer had to do was follow the book on camera settings and keep her in frame. The effort and result here is more akin to advertising than art. Not as cool.\n\nSo that's, like, the *scale* behind it.",
