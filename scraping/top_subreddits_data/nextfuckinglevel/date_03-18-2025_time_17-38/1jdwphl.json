Even though I personally think that's dumb, I do understand. Because the animal doesn't know any better and that could be considered an extreme stressor even if you're actually helping the animal. \n\nI'm not a lawyer but I know that people have gotten in trouble in the past for touching wild animals even though their intent was not to harm the animal. And everywhere that I've seen that documents or shows wild animals such as sea turtles or any other sea creature always says that it is completely illegal to touch them. \n\nSection 9 (B) is usually what gets pointed to here with the harassment part in mind : https://www.fws.gov/laws/endangered-species-act/section-9\n\nAnd then there are state laws on top of that. That depends on where you are. Well, if you're genuinely curious about this, I do recommend you find someone reputable maybe on YouTube that can explain it in a much better way than I can.\n\nObviously I'm on the guy's side in the video. I just hope he doesn't (or didn't) get in trouble for it because technically he could. This could have also happened outside the US in which case I have no idea what the laws are.\n\nA little edit: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/s3/2023-05/02-110-19-renewal-kdr.pdf?hl=en-US look a III Guidance.

I turned myself in to the \"authorities\" (the person working the front desk at the hotel) and they put me in \"jail\" (the hotel office) for about 5 minutes. I called one of the triathlon organizers whose number my mom gave me and he came and got me \ud83d\ude02.
