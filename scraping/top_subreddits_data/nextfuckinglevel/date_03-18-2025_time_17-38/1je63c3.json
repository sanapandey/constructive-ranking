They are patronizing people who can do incredible things, and helping them do bigger things. And they are selling some energy drinks along the way. Is that a naive take? Maybe. But it's the vibe these stunts give off and at a certain point what difference does it make if a few more people drink a few more cans of energy drinks? There is some beautiful artwork that was done in the name of selling a product. There are movies that have tugged at heart strings and told stories that needed to be told, that also enriched a billionaire. Capitalism is a wicked system,  yes, but every now and then it works as it's supposed to and sponsors a whole lot of creative along the way.",
