The broom made from plastic 'recycled' garbage is made from plastic just good enough to function as a single use only soda bottle. \n\nSo yeah, the 10$ broom lasts longer before the bristles enter you or your pet's lungs to live out part of, or all the rest of your life with you. Depending on how often you cough and vomit up your lung lining mucus as a complete map of your lung architecture in phlegm. The joy of being organic in a world with plastic particles, from single-use intended, not really recyclable, plastic bottles. \n\nThe stores by me have a machine that refills shampoo bottles, because single use plastic bottles are a waste of money for most of the corporations now too. And, I get discounts when I reuse my cups at fast food and gas stations. Single use plastic drinking vessels are dumb when humans like to carry their own cup with them as they travel. I prefer my cups. My cups are sometimes plastic, but they ain't single use crap plastic.",

Things don't need to block blood vessels to cause issues\n\n>I feel like there are so many other good reasons to want to stop the manufacturing of single use plastics but this doesn't seem like one of em.\n\nIt seems weird to me that you look at information that shows the concentration of plastic within our bodies is increasing and think it's fine when the available information suggests that it's not fine. Like, do you not think that we should address potential problems before they get to a catastrophic level? \n\nIt seems mental to me to think \"ah well, they're not hurting anyone so it's fine\" when by the time they start causing real problems it could be too late.

Look at it this way. Plastics, even in landfills, eventually turn to microplastics. Sure it takes a long time. But eventually everything in a landfill will turn into a microplastic and make its way into every living organism. So is it not better to reduce how much plastic there is period? Would simply not making any more plastic brooms fix it? Yes! But we both know thats not gonna happen no matter what. In a 100 or 200 or however long it takes everything will breakdown. At the same rate we make new ones nowadays. So would not simply reducing how much gets made period be better no matter what?",

There are a lot of campaigns around this such as the 3R's the 6R's or the 7R's even. The general focus is always to start with reducing consumption and if that can't be done to reuse or repair. \n\nFor bottles it's a lot better to simply reuse them as... bottles, but even more important is to educate people so they buy less bottle drinks in the first place. I cut down on plastic use by reducing soda intake and by replacing soda with syrup that I carbonate myself. In places where bottled water is still popular there is a need to invest in water treatment so that tapwater can be drunk. Stuff like that.",

It gets into the fish they fish, and they food they serve. His country isn't alone, is just harder to pin down our figures, and they aren't as believable anyway given that multiple tracked shipments of \"recycling\" just got sent off to be landfilled overseas.

And additionally believe in lies about percentages of plastic recycling. Thinking buying plastic bottles is okay, because they get \"used somehow anyway\". Basically producing more trash second hand. It's a common devils circle in many places. \n\nI live in a country where we have a system where you have to take back all your plastic bottles made from PET so the material can be reused. This doesn't work forever obviously. And isnt 100% efficient either. But this and only this is recycling. Making clean PET from used PET. There was a time where we crushed them and send them to other countries to make synthetic fabrics or so from it. This is better than a landfill. But the for example fleece pullover made from this has a life expectancy too, is highly likely to generate, either while being produced or afterwards, huge amounts of microplastics, and has to get burned in the end. \n\nIt's a resource one way. Not a circle. And we often talk ourself into thinking plastic is good because of second use cases like this. \n\nMake a broom from it or call it art. I don't care. But this isn't a solution. It would be either producing less plastic or creating a proper system where they get recycled.",

But you certainly can fight improve things and benefit from it. Countries that put a deposit on plastic bottles by law for example got rid of those being littered everywhere in no time. Or removing all the single use plastics from the consumer market, because people are dumb as hell and would throw them everywhere. So you have to take it from them. Like little children.",
