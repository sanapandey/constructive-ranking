Shallow snow melts faster than deeper snow (because there\u2019s less snow to melt). There\u2019s more surface area on pine needles & pine branches for snow to stick to, so much of it will melt before it hits the ground (if it\u2019s warm enough or sunny enough). Heavy snow can break branches, but live pine branches are pretty flexible and springy, and sunlight and temperatures above freezing will eventually lead to clumps of snow melting & falling off branches towards lower branches, or the ground.",

If it\u2019s wet snow or has begun to melt in the sun it can be very heavy, and to make forward movement you have to either lift your legs very high with every step, and/or lift your toes through heavy snow. Your feet and legs can even break through icy layers further down. It\u2019s extremely taxing on the heart, especially if it\u2019s uphill, your heart will be racing, you\u2019ll be hyperventilating. That\u2019s why people invented snow shoes to walk on top of snow and prevent sinking into it with wider weight distribution. Higher elevations also tend to have lower oxygen levels (but certain humans like Sherpas have evolved to adapt to that).\u00a0Deer have been around for 30 million years and have very skinny legs and hooves (easier to lift out of snow), but even they can get stuck in deep snow, and deer don\u2019t sweat either.",

He unknowingly put a lot of pressure on the deer to keep moving and it probably put a lot of unnecessary stress to move away faster than it needed to.\n\nImagine swimming in the ocean and circled by sharks but being completely exhausted from swimming away. Even if they were \u201cfriendly\u201d sharks trying to show you the way, you would be terrified as hell and probably use more energy than what you needed to in a panicked state.\n\nWe only see this as being \u201cnice\u201d because we are human and trust other humans. To wild animals, we are predators.",
