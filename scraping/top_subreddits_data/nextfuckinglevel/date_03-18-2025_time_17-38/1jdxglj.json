He produces work superior to some of his well armed peers, probably at a very competitive rate.  \n\n\n\nStupid DEI rules, ruining my dream of being the only person with marketable skills in my town. I don't need any musical producer, I need a man, with arms, and only men with arms and legs and of a color I prefer. Forever and ever, regardless of what Jobs i need filled, or how many,  or the logical physical requirements for those jobs.\n\n\n\n How else will I find work for all my stupid stupid, untalented neighborhood boys?\n\nIf I don't let them fly all the planes, and perform all the vital surgeries, and deliver the babies. Just because they're good dumb boys, what else can I possibly use their labor for? They'll be bored, and join a gang or a start a religious cult.",
