Max DEX at Lv. 4+6 and get Sharpshooter at 8.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nWhat is champion 11, GOOlock, how do you max dex when you don't change your skill points on lvl ups? I'm new to like D&D type games so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.",

One feature this class gets is on a crit you frighten your target so they can\u2019t move and you get advantage on subsequent hits. \n\nYou can change your ability scores at level 4, 6, and 8 if you are a fighter through feats. Start with 16 DEX, take 18 at level 4, and 20 at level 6. \n\nAt level 8, take the Sharpshooter feat instead of an ability score increase.",
