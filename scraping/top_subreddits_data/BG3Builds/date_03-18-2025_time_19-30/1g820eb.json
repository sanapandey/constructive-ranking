    "selftext": "# Background\n\nSince Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s full launch released with Tactician difficulty and the community began their blind playthroughs, complaints have existed that the game becomes way too easy for those familiar with D&D 5e fundamentals (attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, proficiency, advantage) starting in mid to late Act 2. The game has such strong magic items that after you pay a visit to the merchants in the Creche, Last Light Inn, and Moonrise the difficulty takes a huge nosedive. This lack of difficulty and lack of content for evil playthroughs have been some of the biggest complaints in an otherwise great and generational game. **This post intends to highlight some of the biggest balance shattering mechanics as discussed by this community, inform those looking for more balanced playthroughs on what limits to impose, and also provide mod options to help balance these mechanics or balance enemies.**\n\nA [poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6bMfRBA3w2FXwptjMesrMYMB-ZHZjpMu5Vi-1UXf42CPQ5w/viewanalytics) was created to cover some of the most balance shattering mechanics, using community feedback to determine the topics discussed. The following \u201ccommunity opinions\u201d are those where 52.7% of the community decided some restriction should be used to restore a semblance of balance. My goal was 2/3 of respondents agreeing that a restriction needs to be in place, then going with the most popular choice. However some questions (like whether to use Honour mode rules or whether to use camp casting) could be considered \u2018courtesy\u2019 questions. These restrictions absolutely must be in place to reach the goals of \u201crebalanced\u201d when you consider broken combos like DRS which is fixed by honour mode or warding bond camp casting. The 21% of people who voted that ignoring these restrictions is OK are not in tune with the goal of \u201crebalanced.\u201d So the goal shifted to 2/3 of respondents that are sane, informed on what they are voting on, or voting in good faith. As there are some who feel, \u201cWhy is balance necessary in a PvE game?\u201d is a legitimate question. While that is certainly *an* opinion to have, the people with that opinion are not the people who this topic is intended for. People who want to use broken stuff can use broken stuff. This topic is for identifying what stuff is broken, and what self-imposed rules or mods can be used to restore a semblance of balance.\n\n# What is and is not addressed by \u201cRebalanced?\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t cover everything that is OP. Stuff like Gloomstalker Assassin builds that use hit-and-run mechanics are almost a completely different game. It doesn\u2019t cover gimmicks like stacking crates and having an enlarged owlbear jump on enemies over and over and over again. It doesn\u2019t cover powerful but also very tedious builds focused on getting tons of summons and then buffing them. It doesn\u2019t cover things like barrelmancy. The \u201cRebalanced\u201d discussion is focused on turning a normal playthrough which many would not consider to be tedious, addressing some of the balance breaking mechanics such players have access to, pointing out that their relative strength removes fun from the game for many players, and many people may want to avoid these options.\n\n# BG3Builds Rebalanced Restrictions\n\nThe following table is listed in order of most strongly opinionated in need of restriction, to least strongly opinionated. It starts with the most egregious violators and goes to less egregious ones that a large portion of the community feels needs some kind of restriction for a balanced gameplay experience.\n\n|**Topic**|**BG3Builds Rebalanced Restriction**|**Personal comments, not from community**|**Relevant Mods**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Long Rest Spamming|Once a build is \u201conline,\u201d (typically around level 6-8) it should be able to go at least 3 or 4 fights before a long rest. Not including taking a long rest before a boss fight, which is fine.|If you are concerned about missing story points in camp by limiting long rests, then after a long rest take a partial rest (use no food supplies) to see additional camp scenes.|\\-|\n|Honour Mode Rules|Use Honour Mode rules|This includes no builds that focus on DRS bug, no warlock extra attack stacking, no perilous stakes illithid power on enemies. Additionally no extra attack from bloodlust elixirs or haste spell. **While the community did not vote to restrict the use of spellcasting with extra actions granted by haste or bloodlust elixirs this is potentially a polling error on my part, and I STRONGLY recommend avoiding this.**|\\-|\n|Camp Casting|Do not put allies into your party, have them cast buff spells or other effects, then remove them from your party allowing the buffs to persist|\\-|\\-|\n|Elixir Chugging|No builds that depend on elixirs|The most egregious outliers are strength based elixirs, bloodlust elixirs, elixirs of vigilance and elixir of battlemage\u2019s power. Using other elixirs on consistent basis likely will not be as bad as those listed above.|**In Game Mods**: N/a \u00a0 **External Mods**:  [Elixir Rebalance by Benenach](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4499?tab=description)|\n|Consumables Dependence (e.g. scrolls and special arrows)|\\-|This question was left out by accident. However it goes in the same vein as the above elixir question, regarding farming consumables that your build depends on and therefore should be restricted.|\\-|\n|Tavern Brawler|No using Tavern Brawler if you use Strength Elixirs|**I strongly disagree.** This does absolutely nothing to fix TB Throw builds. TB Monks can dip into fighter or cleric for heavy armor proficiency and dump Dex anyways. Tavern Brawler is broken at its core.|**In-game Mods**: N/a \u00a0 **External Mods:** [Tavern Brawler Rebalanced by VoidVigilante](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1267?tab=files). I recommend the \u201cTavernBrawlerFinesse\\_NoAccuracy\u201d version. This is still pretty strong, and even works with dex based monks, but is not balance shattering; [Feats Rebalanced by WoolToque](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14037/?tab=description) has a nerfs only optional file which also makes changes to Sharpshooter, Great Weapon Master, and Alert|\n|Ranged Slashing Flourish|No combining ranged slashing flourish with Arcane Acuity|\\-|\\-|\n|Abjuration Wizard Arcane Ward|No using exploits (such as spamming Warlock\u2019s Armour of Shadows) to refill the arcane ward|The damage resistance provided by Arcane Ward scales exponentially due to Larian\u2019s changes. At higher levels of wizard it is insane, and I am not sure everyone who voted has seen just how much damage it can mitigate. I recommend not using abjuration wizard if going more than 6 or 7 levels in wizard.|\\-|\n\n# Further Topics\n\nThe following are topics which the community did not agree needed restrictions in BG3Builds Rebalanced, but I feel need addressing.\n\n|Topic|My comments|Relevant Mods|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Initiative|There may be a polling error behind why 34% of respondents in the previous question said no elixir dependence at all, then only 19% here say no dependence on Elixirs of Vigilance. Regardless d4 initiative makes the turnbased game balance issue known as \u201cRocket Tag\u201d extremely easy to pull off. **The Alert Feat and Elixirs of Vigilance should be approached with caution if you are not using mods to bring initiative back to a d20.**|**In-Game Mods:** [d20 Initiative by Ponsinoumi](https://baldursgate3.game/mods#/m/d20initiative_) \u00a0 **External Mods:** [d20 Initiative by Ponsinoumi](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12024) changes initiative to a d20, which by itself rebalances the Alert feat. Alternatively [Feats Rebalanced by WoolToque](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14037/?tab=description) has a nerfs only optional file which also makes changes to Sharpshooter, Great Weapon Master, and Tavern Brawler but high dex characters will still win initiative far too frequently with this fix.|\n|Vulnerability|It is possible to make enemies vulnerable to lightning, cold, psychic, or piercing damage. With some gimmicks you can also make enemies vulnerable to fire damage. Builds that do outright 2x more damage than they are supposed to be able to do against group of enemies are extremely strong. Oftentimes a little bit of setup is necessary, but doing that little bit of setup and then going all in on your strongest option to do double damage is typically way stronger than other build options. This is especially egregious in Act 3 where you can apply piercing vulnerability with no setup, and a well optimized party can almost all do double damage.|\\-|\n|Duergar Invisibility|Technically the problem here extends beyond Duergar. Having a quasit companion (whether through Pact of the Chain Warlock or just through getting permanent access to Shovel) enables the same problem: start every combat while invisible to get a surprise round and thin enemy numbers before they get to go. Duergar just takes this a step further since you have that option on a playable character, letting you do more powerful things while invisible. If you abuse surprise rounds (and unlimited invisibility is the best way to do so) you will make the game significantly easier.|\\-|\n|Arcane Acuity|There are two popular builds that use arcane acuity: swords bard and fire sorc. The sords bard + arcane acuity has been addressed because it depends on swords bard\u2019s very strong ranged slashing flourish which warranted its own question. Fire sorc depends on building up arcane acuity through Scorching Ray, which is not on its own overtuned like ranged slashing flourish. With the community not wanting to restrict arcane acuity, that means fire sorc arcane acuity builds (one of the top 3 strongest builds in the game) are totally fine in rebalanced. While these two are the most popular Arcane Acuity builds, other builds are certainly capable of it such as niche thunder acuity builds, thief rogue builds, action surging fighter builds, and more. **Arcane acuity needs to be capped at +2 to maintain a semblance of balance. +3 max. If you are consistently going above this, arcane acuity should only be used to cast cantrips with.**|\\-|\n|Radiating Orbs|The strength of radiating orbs has been undermined by how offensively strong you can be. The best defense is a good offense, and if you can kill or crowd control everyone before they get to go then there is limited need to be defensive. If you implement the BG3Builds Rebalanced rules then radiating orbs will become much, much stronger and may still make encounters much easier. **Like arcane acuity, radiating orbs need to be capped at +2 or +3**|\\-|\n|Level 1 Wizard Dip|For the most part this is fine in my opinion. The biggest issues come when mixing with Arcane Acuity, but with that off the table there are a few niche spells to be worried about. Such as playing as a full caster class, taking a level in wizard, scribing the Conjure Elemental spell, and using a 6^(th) level slot to buff it into a Myrmidon.|\\-|\n|Ambush Bard Strategy|The \"Ambush Bard\" build is one that probably is only recalled by those who have been on the sub for a while, and kinda didn't want to give up on it. It's somewhat complicated to explain which is a bit of a letdown, however [this 3 minute video covers it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). But with Rebalanced in play it can pretty much just run around and cause balance to desert the game.|\\-|\n\n# Still too easy?\n\nEven with all the above changes and restrictions, those who understand the fundamentals of the game may find BG3 to still be too easy to ensure a challenge. PC users have additional difficulty increasing mods available to them. Most notably [Combat extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207?tab=description). While I am a big fan of the default boost to enemy AC, attack roll, saving throws, and damage per attack; I am not a big fan of increasing enemy movement speed or giving some enemies an extra bonus action. And I would actually like to give enemies more health than their default configuration (\\~40%). But that\u2019s the great thing about the mod. You can change all these little numbers to your liking and they apply to enemies across the game, making the game more challenging. I think that if you go with Combat Extender, d20 initiative, and restrict the mechanics mentioned above then the game finally reaches the challenge many people were hoping for at launch.\n\nAnother external mod worth mentioning is [Absolute Wrath](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5552). It adds random abilities to enemies to make combat a bit more challenging and roguelike all-in-one. If you use this with combat extender, you may want to tone down combat extender from the recommended values.\n\nUnfortunately there do not seem to be any big combat overhaul mods on console yet. One option is to implement an item attunement rule of your own, where you limit yourself to something like as many uncommon items (magic items with a green border) but only up to 3 items of rare or above (blue, purple, or yellow border) per character. Your weapons do not count towards this 3 item limit.\n\n# \u201cRebalanced\u201d and this subreddit\n\nWhile the goal existed to make \u201cRebalanced\u201d into a flair, I think given the community\u2019s votes on the topics found in the second table (excluding perhaps the wizard dip) indicates that this wouldn\u2019t change anything. You\u2019d still have fire acuity sorcs. You\u2019d still have radiating orb clerics that win initiative and hit every enemy with a -5 or more to their attack rolls before they even get to go. You\u2019d still have wet+lightning tempest sorcs or Bhaalist Armor + ranged slashing flourish spam. Throwzerker and TB Monks would still exist, just slightly tuned down. So it seems that going through the trouble of implementing a tag or flair is just not worth it.\n\nThis post will go into the hall of fame post to provide a reference for the most overpowered mechanics which players should avoid if they want a challenge, and I will update it with mods if people make them to reign some of these mechanics in.",

Your spell save DC is 20. Unless enemies have a good stat or are proficient in the save in question, they have a 5% chance to save. I was generous by just limiting it in this way though. Cha based casters can easily get 22 in their main stat, there are many staves and shields that offer more than just a +1 to spell save DC. It is reasonable to assume that a well geared caster can have a flat and passive 23 or 24 spell save DC. Which for many enemies that means 100% crowd control. They literally cannot save. It is an issue that really starts busting out in D&D 5e with most creatures only being proficient in 2 or 3 saves.\n\nSo I'd argue that outside boss fights with Legendary Resistance the issue really is that giving bonuses to spell save DC outside of a staff is really the problem. But that would require sweeping changes on itemization across the game, well beyond the scope of this post. So I think you make a very good point that compared to other items in the game, capping arcane acuity at +4 edit: or +3 seems fair. I was comparing it more to my history with D&D 5e and that isn't the appropriate comparison to make here.",

The difference in skill between a commoner and a demigod is squished into this numerical range.\n\nCombine this with fixed DCs (which I like conceptually) and it means the game cannot hand out many bonuses to spell save DC before it breaks D&D uncertainly/randomness mechanics.\n\nHonestly, I think +4 is still way too much. If Battlemage's Elixir gave you +1 and the acuity hats allowed you to increase this to +2, it would still be an insane buff akin to equipping a 2nd Hood of the Weave. Or akin to equipping a Hood of the Weave approx 100 gameplay hours before you can buy it.",

Your discussion revolves around proficiency but the bigger issue for me is enemies having a *lack* of proficiency. If they don't have proficiency and they are mediocre in a stat then they end up having almost no chance at saving or infact no chance at saving. The saving throw concept with D&D 5e starts breaking down by 9th level and is crumbling apart by 13th level, and this is a huge part of why I don't GM 5e anymore.\n\nIn the context of BG3, is getting a +4 to spell save DC with a little bit of prep powerful? Absolutely. It's extremely strong and will make the game quite a bit easier. Thing is that for an intelligent player the game is already easy. A +3 or +4 nudges the scales further but in my opinion doesn't cause the scales to topple like a +10 does. \n\nIf you were to use mods to buff enemies (e.g. using the Combat Extender mod) to restore balance, accounting for the fact that arcane acuity can go up to +10, then you will buff enemies so much that the only viable strategies are stuff like arcane acuity, tavern brawler, and radiating orb. But if you buff enemies to restore balance accounting for the fact that arcane acuity can go to +3 or +4 then it will still be among the best options in the game, but other options will still be viable.",

            "body": "A mod that I don't see get discussed much despite the game's various OP mechanics being popular points of discussion is the [Rebalanced - Nerfs](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5712) mod by Syrchalis. It has (relatively light) nerfs for the most egregious feats (Alert, GWM, Sharpshooter, TB) and effects (Arcane Acuity, Radiating Orb, even Arcane Synergy). \n\nThe nerfs are very much on the conservative side and don't go as far as you would perhaps like, so these mechanics remain extremely strong if not still OP, but it's better than nothing. For example, Arcane Acuity is nerfed to 5 stacks max, with being hit only removing 1 stack instead of 2 stacks. I think ideally, it should be 3 or 4 stacks max, but 5 is still much better than 10.\n\nThere are also many other OP mechanics not covered by the mod, but many of the remaining ones have other mods (e.g., the elixirs and initiative ones you included) that nerf them. When they're used in conjunction together, then I've found the gameplay experience to be greatly improved. Some of the others that I've liked are:\n\n* [Stat Boosting Items Rebalanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11443) by Rhonin25: Items that set your attribute to a set number (e.g., Amulet of Greater Health) instead just increase that attribute to prevent completely dumping the attribute.\n\n* [Wet Combo Rebalance](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12145) by Fenrisgod78: Instead of wet granting vulnerability to Cold and Lightning, it instead grants advantage on attacks/disadvantage (+ 1d4 penalty) on saving throws.\n\n\nI like being able to use a mod for these nerfs as it still lets me use these mechanics in my playthrough, just without them being as ridiculous as the game base. I'm not as much of a fan of arbitrary restrictions as they can be awkward to implement in practice, and if you just outright ban items/mechanics then it feels disappointing to restrict yourself from an entire set of items/feats/etc. that are already in-game.",

Opt-in:   They weren't explicit enough about essentially wanting to create a new game mode, and set of restrictions that *would not apply to anyone who didn't want to use it*.   This seemed to trigger a loud contingent of \"don't mess with my OP toys\" and \"just don't use it if you don't like it...\"   But it also may have caused people who while they themselves wanted a rebalancing,  voted against their own wishes and interests in the specifics of the polls, either because they couldn't imagine the restrictions being viable in BG3builds or weren't comfortable with potentially pushing their views on a broader community.    \\[Disclosure:   I'm guilty of this voting against my own wishes in the poll...\\]\n2. The polls sought specific rebalancing opinions, even from people who themselves had no interesting in or were actively against rebalancing or restricting OP mechanics and features.   \n\nI'm not sure of the best way to do it, but feels like we should be able to make a poll that amends those key issues, and is able to separate out opinions of those who have no interesting in rebalancing or are even opposed to it if applies to a larger community.    That would leave a contingent of only those that want a rebalancing and are clear the opinions they are voting for would only apply to their rebalanced group.   It feels like that could yield some much more useful poll results, with a greater possibility of reaching consensus on the specifics of how to rebalance.  \n\nIf we're clear in these posts and threads that we intend to create a new modded game mode, rather than wanting to force our vision of \"rebalancing\" on the overall BG3Builds or BG3 communities \"taking away their options and limiting their possible playstyles\"  it should help keep people not interested in game balance away.    Being clear that we're creating something new that won't apply to them, means none of the \"don't mess with other people's fun\" criticisms are applicable.    And instead the argument works in reverse, since Rebalancing is fun for some people, but doesn't affect people who want to continue playing with OP mechanics and features. \n\nOnce we have whittled down to a group of people that are all interested in having a more balanced game, and are making decisions that will only apply to their own rebalanced group,  I think it will be much easier to come to some overall consensus on the specifics of rebalancing that even if we don't all 100% agree on, we should at least be able to get behind.     From that point we can have Flair that's useful for builds and it will be possible to work towards a few mods that implement that rebalancing vision.",

I settled on the rule that \"any item that sets an ability, grants a castable spell, or implements a variable mechanic including d4 damage riders\" was prohibited. So no hill giant club, no Titanstring, no Armour of Agility.\n\nThis is very, very strict, but if _flat_ bonuses are ok (analogous to +2 armour/weapons) that still leaves a few strong items available, like the Hood of the Weave and the Legacy of the Masters. I also like how certain meh items become suddenly desirable, like the item that adds +2 to heals.\n\nFrom there I make exceptions for fun and/or RP reasons. I allow adamantine _weapons_, just for a reward for defeating Grym (the hard way, of course). I also allow a Sussur weapon, which now persists well into Act 3. Momentum mechanics are fine, because mobility is fun (I'm considering allowing Wrath items for martials, but haven't decided). And I often allow each NPC one story based item: a spear for (Selunite) Shart, Khalid's locket for Jaheira, that sort of thing. Provided that they're non-optimal: for example I think I'm going to prohibit Wyll's rapier again - I allowed it in my last run but that Cambion is damn strong.\n\nThe strict gear limitations also mean I don't worry too much about the OP feats, provided that they make RP sense. Minsc as a 4/8 Ranger/Berserker with GWM and TB is canon, IMO, and it's fun that he's a beast for the few quests that he joins.\n\nI also don't allow acquiring ANY consumables from vendors, which suits my loot goblin playstyle and causes me to use and even hoard my best potions and scrolls for the tough fights. Ansur and the Netherbrain NEED a Globe of Invulnerability, for example, so if I don't have a wizard I'll need two of those scrolls.",

Each time this is discussed there is some pushback of, \"If it's OP in a PvE game then stop complaining and don't use it.\" Ignoring the fact that the whole purpose of this is to identify what the community considers OP and recommending their removal for others interested in non-OP builds or discussing alternate strategies. But here has been some consistent interest in this topic among the community. Discussion on an optional ruleset that reigns in overpowered character options has been around on this sub since before honour mode. Only issue is Honour mode did not go half far enough at controlling OP options.\n\nI could go for it as a personal initiative and have thought to do so. I added my personal comments to the results here on things the community voted on which I strongly disagree with. But seeing the community votes on the topics is what makes it clear that the community wants change on many of these topics.

I let him make all the decisions, build his own character, and was mostly just there for combat.  The difference that that made was *extreme.*  I was barred from multiple important missable items, and he got cooked quite often.\n\nMy point is, designing BG3 in a way that someone with no TTRPG experience could get into was pivotal to the success of BG3, and many of your complaints come from a place of \"I am extremely knowledgeable about the system in use in this game and it was too easy\".

If, in these major patches, issues raised by the community were tossed into the custom difficulty options, that'd be a home run by Larian.  That said, with my limited business knowledge, I would assume that would require a lot of resources and capital in the cases of systems that may need full redesigns, and that'd likely be a net loss in profit.",

And for things like telekinesis and throwing enemies off ledges, or letting 1 level wizard dip scribe spells up to the level of spell slots they have access to, or perhaps even with haste a little bit I can see your point (though the imbalance of Haste is in my opinion a bridge too far). I get what you are saying. But letting arcane acuity go to +10 is nuts. No player who doesn't know what they are doing is going to pull that off, and players who do know what they are doing just won the game. Same with radiating orb. Same with stuff like Bhaalist armor. I wish I could say for Larian's sake  \"Same with Arcane Ward\" or \"Same with Tavern Brawler\" but I can't. A level 10 abjuration wizard even in the hands of a novice player is just too damn tanky. And I am literally watching a let's play of a new and inexperienced player who doesn't have a clue what he is doing but picked Tavern Brawler and discovered pretty fast that giant elixirs and haste potions are a cheat code, and further found the club of hill giant strength and next episode turned up difficulty to Tactician. I expect that after 10 more episodes he is going to respec because his build is OP.\n\nYou mention that it may be too much work to fix this. I made a post on r/BG3Mods asking for a mod that addresses many of these topics. I got a pretty consistent reply of \"looks easy, should be able to do it yourself in a few hours when you learn the mod tools.\" In a manner akin to me telling people to just go to the hall of fame post. So next weekend we'll see if they are correct as I will try to make a mod that does this myself.\n\nBut I also want to bring it back to the comment you are replying to. Because your comment is more addressed to the body of the post, not my above comment. My above comment is basically, \"Even if you remove or nerf all the most broken stuff, and even if you are a new player on your first blind playthrough with no meta-knowledge, the game is still too easy for somebody who understands the core mechanics (for BG3 that is attack rolls, saves, ability checks, proficiency, advantage).\" Before BG3 the most recent I could say statement about would be KotOR2 released almost 20 years prior. Now Owlcat's WH40K Rogue Trader released after BG3 and it had substantial balance issues. But Owlcat put a lot more work into fixing those than BG3 has, and it shows.",

And I agree it didn't need to be discussed.\n\nMy viewpoint is that even without these limitations, the game is still a breeze to a knowledgeable player on honour mode. Just taking the Rebalanced mechanics out of the game is not going to make the game challenging for many players. So my overall take is, \"If I can use the mods found in the 'Still Too Easy?' part of this post, do these mechanics still turn the difficulty on its head?\" If the answer is yes, even using mods to substantially increase difficulty is not enough to make the game challenging due to these mechanics, then that mechanic deserves to be in Rebalanced. For that ring enemies would have a +3 or +4 to their saves by that stage in the game over traditional tactician difficulty. And you don't have arcane acuity buffing your DC to insane levels. So while the ring is strong, I don't think it prevents balance from being salvaged unlike the topics in this post.\n\nHonestly the thing not in this post which maybe should be is mass healing word (or life domain cleric channel divinity) + whispering promise ring and hellrider's pride gloves.",

Arcane Acuity is the problem child here, and hitting specific combinations that are good with it is not going to render it acceptable. \n\nThe other thing that often doesn't get mentioned is that vendor resetting isn't necessary to accumulate sufficient consumables to dominate the game with them. If you visit each vendor exactly one time, buy what you need, and leave, about the only thing you won't have in sufficient quantity is an arbitrarily large number of elixirs prior to act 3. Banning elixirs is not insignificant, but there just aren't enough fights in the game to place a harsh enough tax on consumables to outpace the rate at which they're acquired from merchants and corpses, even without any farming whatsoever.\n\nBut the biggest issue with this concept, admirable as the idea of increasing the difficulty of the game may be, is that the difficulty of BG3 does not come from mechanics, it comes from lack of knowledge. We know how to trivialize the game because we've been playing it for an extended period of time. A new player with zero prior knowledge can march off the Nautiloid, head to a fight like the Gith Patrol that's higher level than their party is, and promptly wipe out due to not having known they ought to have gone elsewhere first no matter what Lae'zel said. You can't replicate that with nerfs.",

Is it possible to get a ton of lightning and cold and fire arrows? Yes. Is it possible to to get a ton of scrolls like see invisibility, protection from evil and good, firebolt, vampiric touch, etc.? Yes Is it likely to get a ton of specifically the best arrows in the game, or scrolls of specifically the best spells in the game, and planning your build around that? Not without refreshing vendors.\n\nYou make a better argument than most on how game knowledge affects difficulty. But as mentioned in the post, it is really midway through Act 2 where the complaints mostly exist. If you are taking on the Gith patrol at level 3 or below and winning, it is because you know the ins-and-outs of the game and are using meta-knowledge. Once you get past Act 1 is where the complaints about balance really take off. Where even rather subdued builds can just start easily winning fight after fight, and builds that use the strategies in this post don't even break a sweat. Some of these strategies require pretty in-depth knowledge. Like spamming armour of shadows to fill Arcane Ward. But some of them don't at all. Does your party consist of two or three characters with 16 Dex or more? Congrats, you made the game way easier. Did you select the haste spell when it was presented to you on the level up screen, or often use those haste potions the game hands out to you? Congrats, you made the game way easier. Did you take abjuration wizard because in tabletop it is a slightly above average wizard subclass? Congrats, Act 3 just became a joke. Did you take one glimpse at Tavern Brawler and immediately realized that the balance train had left the station, and Larian never even bought a ticket let alone got onboard? Congrats because that is exactly right. There is no way Tavern Brawler should have made it into even a testing phase of this game. It is that egregiously bad.\n\nAs I have commented elsewhere in these comments,  I put down my first blind playthrough in disappointment due to the lack of difficulty. The only mechanic from the above post I used was abjuration wizard, and once I hit 10 wizard I respecced because the game was so easy. I had a Tav that was an Asmodeus Tiefling Lore Bard 5/Ancients Paladin 7 who was Cha based and mostly cast Moonbeam and cloud of daggers (no sanctuary) and may have used the attack action 5 times all playthrough after the tutorial. Lae'zel as a straight beast master ranger. Gale (later replaced by Jaheira) as a straight Land druid. And Shadowheart as a knowledge cleric 1/abjuration wizard 11, later respecced to evocation wizard. These are not OP builds like what is discussed in the post. This was my first playthrough. This was before the wiki was in 5% of the completion state that it now is. Game was still way too damn easy.",

The goal is moreso removing Larian's more egregious homebrew. \n\n>the basic design of the game itself ... doesn't seem to want to challenge the player to the degree people appear to want it to\n\nThis is completely fair. Larian seems to be thoroughly on the side of \"this DnD campaign is a power fantasy\" and there's nothing really wrong with that.",

If somebody made a mod capping arcane acuity at +2 or +3 I'd be more excited to use it. But as it is that is not the case. Hopefully this post is a way to inspire modders to create such mods.\n\nI don't want to see these things removed necessarily. I want to see them usable without breaking the game. But in lieu of official fixes by Larian or mods to do so, limiting yourself is unfortunately necessary if you want a challenge. Even if you give all enemies a +5 to their saving throws and 50% more health, an arcane acuity spammer that goes first thanks to d4 initiative and crowd controls enemies by spending a ton of spell slots, then long rests to get those spell slots back, isn't going to have a challenge. The mechanics characters have access to need to be reigned in for those who know what they are doing and still want a challenge where optimized builds and smart gameplay is necessary, just not allowed to run wild.\n\nAs far as removing stuff that is even \"slightly useful\" I really have to disagree. Rebalanced isn't saying ranged slashing flourish by itself turns off difficulty, even though it basically makes swords bard into a full caster and full on fighter all at once. It isn't saying that Githyanki having proficiency in 5 more skills than every other race and medium armor proficiency is banned. It's not saying Hunger of Hadar or Spirit Guardians is OP and shouldn't be used if you want a challenge. Because that doesn't fundamentally turn the balance of the game on its head. The topics discussed here are not \"slightly useful.\" They are absolutely game changing.",

It's just how Arcane Ward works. In tabletop, Armor of Shadows works even better than in BG3, because you don't have to equip armor in order to dispel the Mage Armor between each cast. (And in tabletop, it takes 1 minute to put on and 1 minute to take off light armor, 5m/1m for medium armor, or 10m/5m for heavy armor; Cast-Off Armor is magic armor that takes 1 action to remove.) Even if you didn't have Armor of Shadows, an Abjuration wizard in tabletop can just ritual cast Alarm to achieve the same goal.",

Several boss fights in this game have a rest pod or fountain of rest or angelic reprieve potions before if the boss is located in an area where resting is restricted. One exception to this is the hag's lair, but that only has one fight when you actually get into there. Do I long rest before every boss fight? No. But a big part of that is I know where to get cheap exp to level up and which bosses are easier than others and can plan to go through zones which I know I am ready for. Honestly, I consider people voting this way and thereby removing from the conversation Sorcs that are only strong because of how many Sorc points they can go through in a turn from the Rebalanced discussion to be a win. And I think this spirit of making builds that don't long rest every fight will drive people to conserve resources a bit more.\n\n>Armor of Shadows is not an exploit. It's just how Arcane Ward works. In tabletop, Armor of Shadows works even better than in BG3, because you don't have to equip armor in order to dispel the Mage Armor between each cast.\n\nI agree with all this. But it also leaves out that in Tabletop the most a level 12 wizard's ward would absorb when at max value and without refilling is 29 damage. In BG3 that same ward on that same character could absorb 300 damage. If it starts at full in BG3, you and an ally are targeted by an AOE, and you use your reaction to shield that ally and you protect yourself (which doesn't use a reaction) you have just protected up to 47 damage. Not to mention another damage you may reduce during enemy turns. The exponential damage scaling is insane. At first the armor of shadows interaction worked just like 5e. But instead of fixing Arcane Ward to not scale exponentially, they instead tried to 'fix' Armour of Shadows being used to fill Arcane Ward. So I would say it is an exploit in BG3's eyes which should be restricted because of how nuts Arcane Ward is in this game.",

If playing on tactician or below I think a lot of these restrictions remain fair. But on honour mode where you have single save and bosses have some tuned up mechanics, I think that makes some of these mechanics a bit less egregious. The go-to strategy for solo honour mode is to enter combat from stealth as a gloomstalker assassin, kill half the enemies, since you won initiative you get to go again before everyone else, kill a large chunk of remaining enemies, then use bonus action to hide and leave combat. Rinse-and-repeat. These types of tedious strategies (tons of summons with a lot of buffs for the summons, or owlbear from the top rope everything, barrlemancy, etc.) are not covered by the intent of this topic. If you are doing something other than gloomstalker assassin surprise spam, your solo-honour mode will be 10x more difficult than the average person's.\n\nSo since there isn't too much discussion on this, I'll give my two cents. Ask again in a couple months and maybe my opinion will change. First the restrictions I think need to remain in place. Arcane acuity combined with always winning initiative on a build that is able to build up arcane acuity with their action, then crowd control with their bonus action (e.g. Sorc using hat of fire acuity and scorching ray combined with quicken metamagic) feels like too much to me, even for solo-honour mode. A more tame arcane acuity build is fine. Camp casting also feels like it is too much, even for solo-honour mode. I feel like you should still use honour mode character rules when it comes to haste and DRS. I feel like spamming rests to reset vendors and get scrolls of chain lightning or arrows of many targets should also remain off limits.\n\nNext the restrictions I think can be slackened for solo honour mode. I think tavern brawler becomes more acceptable in a solo honour mode playthrough, though cheesing elixirs along with it seems too much to me.  In this post I recommend against taking abjuration wizard above level 6, but for a solo playthrough I could see a cap of about 9 (or maybe even no cap, it's tough to say with the exponential scaling of this feature and the additional ability abjuration wizards get at level 10). Radiating orbs is not as big an offender as arcane acuity, and I could see lifting any restrictions here. And in fact I think it may be necessary to not restrict initiative and just go all-in with d4 initiative in order to have a chance with solo honour mode.",

I'll do another post about second set of rules.\n\n1. LR spamming: obviously, sometimes one particular boss fight can go pretty wrong and you end up exhausting all resources and must do a back to back LR before and after the boss fight. \n   * One way I can think of it is limiting how many LRs you can have in a particular stage. Like how many before you must finish the grove, then how many before you must reach Moonrise, etc. Are there any suggestions on how this can be implemented?\n   * I don't think custom ruleset -> 3x camp supply cost would be enough.\n2. HM rules: no comments. On by default. Though I think not allowing using hasted action to cast may push the caster into Sorc's quicken spell too much? I'll try not to because I think in some previous editions, haste does not allow you to cast two spells in one round either.\n   * Maybe custom ruleset -> hide failed perception roll too. But I guess this will just mean honor players would memorize all traps etc.\n3. Camp casting: one thing I can think of is to restrict mercs as well. Especially if you think wizard dip is fine. Shadowheart or Jaheira for example can now take a level 2 wizard dip in transmutation and double as a herbalist/potion maker which can even be lore acceptable.\n4. Elixir rebalance: no comments. The rebalance mod seems good.\n5. Consumables. I think maybe limit using LR to restock merchants should be sufficient? Or loot only.\n6. TB: mod seems good.\n7. Ranged Slash fluorish: no comments. I think maybe restrict it like Hunter ranger's multi attack ability.\n8. no comments.",

In the base game, even not super experienced players can still finish the game just fine on HM using adequate, non-optimized builds and play styles. \n\nAt least for me, a major part of rebalancing (through mods or personal restrictions) is not only to make the game more challenging but also increasing build diversity. Not only do I not find it fun when what should be difficult boss fights are actually a breeze, I also don't enjoy it when there aren't any real choices in feats/spells/items because only a select few are worth using.\n\nThis is why I use the Rebalance suite of mods by Syrchalis (on mobile so too lazy to link but I discuss them in another comment here), which actually gives many (mostly minor) buffs to underpowered or underutilized spells and feats.\n\nI personally instead prefer the approach of mods nerfing these OP mechanics, although buffing enemies through mods like Combat Extender is still needed even with mods. I just don't think it's ideal to buff enemies by an extraordinary amount because you go back to square one of the problem of crowding out so many of this game's cool build options.",

I'll caveat that I have limited experience with stealth/invisibility myself, but I've seen that it does become ridiculous when abused. I've myself seen invisibility break enemy AI even when not abusing it.\n\nAt least for 2b though, I feel that strategies like fight resetting falls into the same category of cheese like barrelmancy and goes beyond the scope of discussions around balancing the game. These mechanics are outside the realm of \"regular\" combat and players that abuse them likely aren't interested in the same balancing ideas that we would be. Players who enjoy using these mechanics may not be interested in such a mod as you have to go out of your way in the first place to abuse the mechanic.\n\nTo be clear, my impression is that players that use invisibility fight resetting often combo with other restrictions such as solo HM runs, and at that point it kind of becomes a different game, so I'm not trying to disparage that playstyle at all.",
