I tried AoE spells, I tried scroll of see invisibility, hell I even tried making a light shine on my character and they will come up hit me twice for half my health+ and then go invisible and move pretty far away where it's a complete guess where there at. I been taking my party in different areas trying to keep the guard alive but damn this is impossible.\n\nI run a Bardadin, a berserk thrower, a cleric, and for this I'm running a druid but I normally run a sorclock. I'm at my wits end because the Bardadin and berserker cannot see them at all. And the cleric it's a random guess. ",

Secondly, wide ranging AoE effects work quite well (Faerie Fire might work, but I also recommend Flaming surfaces). If you're on pc, you can right click their icons with your ranged weapon equipped and click on Main Hand Attack (Ranged) to attack them with a Bow or Crossbow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven without invisibility hindering you though, it can be a tough fight.",
