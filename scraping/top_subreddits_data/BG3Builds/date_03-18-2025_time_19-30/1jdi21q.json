    "selftext": "I have finished 1 run  on the patch-8 stress-test on honor mode - using mostly the new subclasses. Here is my review of the subclasses I have played so far:\n\n1. **Arcane Archer** **Fighter** \\- I played a mono-class arcane archer from start to beginning. Anyone who has played a battle-master archer will know how busted the maneuvers can be from range. The arcane archer is even more busted IMHO because the save DC on the arrows is from intelligence and thus benefits from arcane acuity and save-dc gear. In act-1, you get [Mel's first staff](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Melf%27s_First_Staff) and the [shadespell circlet](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Shadespell_Circlet) which is equal to a +4 on intelligence. As a fighter, you also get 4 feats and can in the worst case afford 2 ability score improvements to dexterity, sharpshooter and 1 ability score improvement to intelligence leading to 20 dexterity, 18 intelligence and sharpshooter. However, 16 intelligence is probably enough because of +spell save DC gear or arcane acuity. I also used the broken combo of the Harold and the gloves of baneful striking to apply -2d4 to everyone's saving throws. The arrows I mostly played around were the beguiling arrow, shadow arrow and banishing arrow. These are either wisdom or charisma saves and almost every enemy in the game has a poor charisma or wisdom save. You get 10 of these per short rest at level 10 and thus can afford to use them generously.. Beguiling arrow was more flavor but combo'd very well with the College of Glamor's mantle of majesty command. Getting banish at level-3 is so strong. I could afford to regularly banish the strongest enemy in a fight on round-1 starting level-3.  **PROS**: Plentiful short rest special arrows that target wisdom or charisma. Easy to build up save-dc. Feels like a true control class while still having absurd damage. **CONS**: [Curving shot](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Curving_Shot) as implemented feels very bad. It almost always hits random objects or even neutral bystanders. It only really works if you have a clumped group of enemy units. \n2. **College of Glamor Bard** \\- I did not really feel this class. It has one absurdly broken ability in [Mantle of Majesty Command](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Mantle_of_Majesty:_Command). A few notes on the charm requirements for 100% hit rate - it can trigger on any charmed enemy, no matter the source of the charm. If your arcane archer with massive spell save dc applies charm through a beguiling arrow, you bard can use it to hit mantle of majesty command. While it does occupy your concentration slot, it's not the command itself that requires concentration - maintaining mantle of majesty does. So if you have extra bonus action from thief or other sources, you can apply the command effect more than once per round. [Mantle of Inspiration](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Mantle_of_Inspiration) is also stronger than it seems. It's charm effects seem to affect all kinds of charm-immune enemies like undead etc. This broadens the applicability of mantle of majesty command quite a bit. I managed to apply this to Ketheric (undead and thus should be immune to charm) in the rooftop fight by proccing an opportunity attack. And while it seems like trivial amounts of temporary hit points, it adds up to quite a few by level 10 - 4x11 = 44 temp hit points across the party for a bardic inspiration die at level 10. However, I was overall underwhelmed by this class. It's big ticket feature is a combat winning and it makes sense that it is limited to once per long rest but outside of it, it doesn't have too much flavor. Perhaps more creative uses of mantle of inspiration could come up but with my limited play it feels mostly like a way to trigger mantle of majesty command. Perhaps a good way to top off armor of agathys when a wielder has gone below 11 temp hit points? **PROS**: Combat winning ability in mantle of majesty command given charm via opportunity attacks is easy to trigger. Makes great use of extra bonus actions for this feature. **CONS**: Once per long rest ability feels wrong on a Bard. Bard encourages short rest parties and mantle of inspiration does not feel enough of a flavor defining feature to keep combat interesting throughout the day.\n3. **Path of the Giant Barbarian**  \\- This class is quite broken as implemented. It is probably the new strongest thrower or close but is more than just that. As implemented Tavern Brawler applies as a rider to the elemental damage from [Elemental Cleaver](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Elemental_Cleaver), even on honor mode. This leads to absurd damage numbers. Elemental Cleaver's elemental type can be changed without any action/bonus action and thus leads to nice flexibility even if the TB damage rider on it was fixed. Want to trigger the snowburst ring on a distant enemy - use cold. Want to trigger the ichorous gloves - use acid. I think this would combo really well with the shadow magic sorcerer's [hound of ill omen](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Hound_of_Ill_Omen)'s [Omen](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Hound%27s_Omen_(Condition)) ability. The ability to also change any weapon into a throwing weapon is fun. Most special abilities of non-throwing weapons sadly dont trigger on being thrown, but it does let you pick the right type based on the enemies you are fighting. I used a big mace against Ketheric given magic bludgeoning is the only type he is not resistant to. My favorite feature on this class was actually the [Boot of the Giants](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Boot_of_the_Giants). The animation and feel of the kick ability is great. It benefits from TB and all kinds of unarmed damage riders (boots of Kushigo, special unarmed gloves etc.) and thus does respectable damage for a bonus action attack. If you take a level of monk, it also benefits from [deft strikes](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Martial_Arts:_Deft_Strikes). I multi-classed into thief and 1 level of monk just to make kicking enemies around more effective. I had my barbarian use the callous glow ring and the luminous armor. Kicking enemies and seeing radiant orbs pop up everywhere was satisfying. **PROS**: Elemental cleaver and the kick ability are an ideal combination of fun, flexible and strong. The kick ability does not require rage and thus helps sustain through a long day on limited rage charges. **CONS**: More of the TB madness that we already have in the game.\n4. **Hexblade** \\- As of update-2 of the stress-test, Hexblade's extra attack is gone in honor mode, even with pact of the blade. Till this is fixed, it is going to be hard to evaluate how strong this class is, but I think I have seen enough to say that this class will be immensely strong once this bug is fixed. Probably the strongest 1-class dip in the game since it gets martial weapons, medium armor, shield proficiencies, the shield spell, armor of agathys, and charisma based weapon attacks/damage and the broken [hexblade's curse](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Hexblade%27s_Curse_(Condition)) all at level-1. I am fairly sure that the probability of hexblade's curse from [hexblade-weapon](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Hexed_Weapon_(Condition)) is broken. It is supposed to apply only [20% of the time](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Bind_Hexed_Weapon) according to the wiki but feels like it is at least 50% if not more. If a cursed enemy is killed (even by allies), you gain warlock level + charisma modifier hit points. This is a strong sustain ability in combat. I am hardly ever not on full health as a hexblade. The proficiency bonus damage rider seems to apply to non-weapon damage sources like the initial thunder damage from booming blade or to each of the rays of eldritch blast. Thus even for an Eldritch Blast build, it might make sense to attack with your blade till you get the curse and then start blasting. [Accursed Specter](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Accursed_Spectre_(reaction)) as of now has no limits and allows you to get multiple specters in one combat. These are fairly strong and can use their reaction to attack a cursed enemy when your warlock attacks them. My take is that this ability is too strong if there are unlimited uses, but will be too meh if there are too few uses in a day. The The hexblade gets banishing smite at level-9 and [armor of hexes](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Armour_of_Hexes) at level-10 which improve its damage and survivability even more. **PROS**: Between what seems like a bugged curse probability, massive heals from killing cursed enemies and armor of hexes, the hexblade is near un-killable. It might make for a very strong solo honor mode contender. It has great use of action (EB, weapon attacks, spells) , bonus action (banishing smite, hexblade curse) and reactions (accursed specter and armor of hexes). The reactions are so strong, that this class might be the best recipient of the duelist's prerogative. The damage from hexblade's curse is a rider on many damage sources as of now and is thus significant. The class is super flexible and thus fun - good at EB, good at weapon attacks, good at tanking, good at spells. **CONS**: None that I can think of, especially if the pact of the blade interaction is fixed in honor mode. Perhaps way too strong?\n\nI am on my second run now and am running Oath of the crown, Death Cleric, Bladesinger and Swashbuckler. Will review these once I am at least in act-3 but so far they each feel both very strong and fun. Great work by Larian in making these new subclasses. ",

                    "body": "The arcane archer does not really require arcane acuity to work. Between 4 feats (16 or 18 intelligence easy), many pieces of [spell-save DC gear](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/List_of_equipment_that_affect_Spell_Save_DC) (3 in act 1 alone), you are all set. Spell-save DC gear is so plentiful that even in a party full of spell-casters, there is enough to go about. You can equip one of the staffs, Ketheric's shield (or two of the staffs instead if you take the dual wielder feat), one of the head pieces,  and one of the cloth armors. That's a +4 save DC. Let's say you only equip 2 of the 4 pieces. Even then, with the Harold crossbow and the gloves of baneful striking (best used on an archer with arrosw of multiple targets), you get 2d4 + 2 to save DC. Most enemies also have a poor charisma or wisdom saving throw.  There are also 3 arcane acuity hats in act-2, that can work for the arcane archer with either the drakethroat glaive (also contended) or easier yet - special arrows like the fire and thunder arrows. The Battlemaster archer is great but there are fewer ways to increase the weapon save DC than there are to increase spell-save DC. It really depends on what you want to do. Ranged trip attack, menacing attack and disarming attack are super strong. If you like the flavor of those, go for it. Banishing arrow and shadow arrow are similarly debilitating. You also get 10 such arrows per short rest compared to the battlemaster's 5.\n\n  \nI think removal of extra attack for Hexblade is intended. However, even with pact of the blade - we do not get extra attack for hexblade or any other warlock for that matter in honor mode. This is a bug introduced in update-2 of the stress test. I think it's totally fair that Hexblade is forced to take pact of the blade or to multiclass to another extra attack class to get the extra attack, but as it stands now Hexblade and all other pure warlock builds that use pact of the blade are broken.",

You probably don't even need any spell save DC gear if you have 16 intelligence (+3) and +5 DC. At later levels that that is 8 (base) + 4 (proficiency) + 8 (3 from intelligence) and 2d4 from the 2 sources of bane) for an  average of 20 DC without any spell save gear.",

It also opens up the possibilities of making a crit build for it.\n\nI played Arcane Archer on Laezel and quite frankly I don\u2019t enjoy very much the arrows, besides the one that Blinds enemies as it allows for advantages against enemies and your squishy companions are less likely to get shot from ranged attacks. Gloves of Baneful Strikes are exceptionally good for it because they\u2019re less contended. In Act 1 I equipped the Baneful short sword on my main character and the cc effects were all over the place without having to use the Banishing Arrow. In Act 3 with how easy it is to hoard Arrows of Slaying and Many Targets Arcane Archer\u2019s features kind of get outshined by Titanstring-Elixir\u2019s huge mob clearing abilities. Also worth a little noting that there\u2019s currently a bug where ranged attacks don\u2019t always have modifiers correctly added in Damage Rolls and Fighter is the only one that most of the times correctly does it.

Even with 2 attacks per round, a level 11 Hunter is probably better at dealing with mobs of weak enemies.\n\nBut an arcane archer IMHO is better at single target damage/control. The effects it has with the special arrows are more than just damage - blinding a strong enemy benefits your entire party. Banishing a steel watcher or a boss is similarly clutch.",

You can use might impel to throw anything including your elemental cleaver enhanced weapon. Berserker gets 4 attacks (3 in first round) to Giant's 3 attacks (2 in first round). Both get only 2 with action surge. So I think they are fairly matched at that level given the absurd damage numbers that you can get on a TB riding damage type that can be doubled with wet.  No save prone is super powered as a way to deal with many of the legendary boss reactions etc., so perhaps Berserker still is better at certain fights. (1d6 (elemental cleaver) + 2 \\* 6 (TB modifier from 22 strength. Possible in act-2 with the +2 strength drink from Araj)  + 4 (2x rage modifier from giant's barbarian is added to the elemental damage too)) x 2 (wet) is a lot of damage per throw.
