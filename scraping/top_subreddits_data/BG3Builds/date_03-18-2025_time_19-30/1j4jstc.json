    "selftext": "Last year this subreddit did a bracket regarding your favorite subclass, for which you can find the results of [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1c0sfbt/favorite_subcalsses_bracket_championship_open/). This year we will be doing a similar bracket but for your favorite multiclass combos.\n\n[You can submit your votes to determine the initial seeding of multiclass combinations here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0W4-8bZ90K1JID2frVBYDJzVvp9ZZV90risvp7aK869JNVA/viewform?usp=dialog). In similar fashion to last year, the top 4 will all get a bye round. What will I do if say Bard/Paladin and Paladin/Bard both end up winning their respective classes? Cry. Then wing it. I'll probably give the class that has less competition among its subclasses (i.e., the favorite multiclass combo is more dominant) the spot on the bracket, and then for the other class put their second place choice on the bracket.",

The question for some combinations (especially Cleric/Wizard) would have 56 options. And that is not even taking into account something like a 1 wizard multiclass dip which wouldn't get a subclass, so I guess the cleric/wizard question alone would have 63 possible answers.\n\nFor the sake of this being user friendly, that type of process was out of the question. When the bracket is set up and things are going against one another, folks can comment and discuss their specific preferences if they choose",
