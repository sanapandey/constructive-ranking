    "selftext": "\nSo, you've forged a deep bond with nature, and have subsequently sworn an oath to preserve the sanctity of life. Where do you go from here? \n\nSounds to me like you've sworn the Oath of the Ancient Swarm. A combination of Oath of the Ancients paladin, and Swarmkeeper ranger. A questionable, if thematic combination. What's it all about?\n\nPaladins are all about Divine Smite. An extra 1d8 radiant damage on any successful attack at the cost of a spell slot. Upcastable to add 1d8 per spell level.\n\nSwarmkeepers provide an additional 1d6 of either piercing, lightning, or psychic damage (depending on the swarm chosen) onto any successful attack for no resource at all. An additional 1d6 of the same damage type is applied if you've already cast Hunter's Mark on the target. Hunter's Mark also has the base benefit of an additional 1d6 weapon damage on hit. \n\nWithout taking into account weapon dice or any other equipment/feats, that's already 1d8 + 3d6, or 4-24 damage. Yes it cost us 2 spell slots to get there, but there are methods to conserve these in practice. \n\nSetup:\n\nI don't think racial choice matters a whole lot. Wood elf movement speed is nice, but the choice is yours. To me, this sounds like a good Halsin build if you're looking to move him away from druid.\n\nStats:\n\nThis is the biggest weakness of the build as it can be a bit MAD, but the level distribution you choose can inform your stat decision. For this, I'll lean a bit more into charisma. \n\nStr - 17\nDex - 10\nCon - 15\nInt - 8\nWis - 10\nCha - 14\n\nIf you're not using the Hag's Hair on this character, I'd recommend 16 Str and 12 dex instead.\n\nFeats:\n\nGreat Weapon Master,\nASI : Str, \nSavage Attacker / Resilient: Con\n\nLevel Split:\n\n\u2022 This version of the build will end up at 8 paladin / 4 ranger. Both classes are half casters, so you don't lose slots either way. I've chosen to go further into paladin for the auras, which is why we got to 14 in charisma. \n\n\u2022 The opposite split of 8 ranger/4 paladin will give you Land's Stride and Writhing Tide which could be very valuable in certain party comps.\n\n\u2022 In either case, you'll get all armor and weapon proficiencies, as well as 2 fighting styles. I recommend Great Weapon Fighting and Defense. \n\n\u2022 I prefer to have paladin as the level 1 class so you get wis save proficiency, and heavy armor proficiency without taking Ranger Knight. \n\n\u2022 As far as leveling order goes, it would be wise to take paladin to 5 before taking ranger levels to make sure you get extra attack. If you really want to establish the flavor of the build early, then 2 levels of paladin followed by 3 of ranger will give you the Swarm, Hunter's Mark and Divine Smite by level 5. This version of the build uses the Flurry of Moths. You'll just delay extra attack until 7 or 8 at the earliest, depending on which class you're getting extra attack from. This is where Halsin comes in. By the time you get him, the build can come fully online. \n\nGear:\n\n\u2022 I won't be too detailed with gear, though I do have some recommendations.\n\n\u2022 You'll definitely want Initiative boosting gear. The Bow of Awareness is available early and provides a +1 bonus. Later on, the Hellrider Longbow gives +3. \n\n\u2022 Use whatever 2 handed weapon you prefer, but thematically I believe Sorrow and the Moonlight Glaive are the best fit. The Flurry of Moths and Butterflies from the Moonlight Glaive fit nicely.\n\n\u2022 Armor is your choice, but heavy will be best considering our low dexterity score. \n\n\u2022 We'll spend a lot of time concentrating on Hunter's Mark, so the Strange Conduit Ring will provide a lot of value. \n\n\u2022 Speaking of concentration, bonuses to Con saves or concentration saving throws will do a lot to help you conserve spell slots. A single Hunter's Mark can last all day if you never lose that concentration. The Holy Lance Helm provides a +1 bonus. Late game, the Amulet of Greater Health provides advantage, and if you have Resilient: Con, and Aura of Protection then you would have a +13 bonus on top of the advantage. Probably overkill.\n\n\u2022 The Grymskull Helm can provide a free cast of Hunter's Mark to preserve a spell slot. \n\n\u2022 Later in the game, the Circlet of Hunting will provide attack roll bonuses. \n\n\u2022 Radiant Orb gear is still effective, especially once you start using the Moonlight Glaive. \n\nGameplay:\n\nIt's pretty straight forward. You'll likely start most encounters with Hunter's Mark. Then you'll want to hit the target you applied the mark to. Upon a successful hit, you'll trigger the free action from your swarm, adding some extra psychic damage. Then you'll have the opportunity to add a Divine Smite on top of that if you choose. \n\nA standard paladin can do such big nova damage thanks in large part to GWM, and Divine Smite. This build can still do that, just as well, but allows you to be more selective about when you use your spell slots as you'll get at least 1d6 psychic damage on every hit thanks to the Flurry of Moths. That damage is increased to 2d6 psychic + 1d6 slashing if Hunter's Mark is on the target. \n\nDamage:\n\nAssuming level 12 with GWM, Moonlight Glaive, 20 Str, Hunter's Mark, Strange Conduit Ring, using the Moonlight Butterflies ability, and a spell level 1 Divine Smite you get:\n\n1d10+1d8+3d6+2d4+10+5+5+2= 29-73 damage one one swing. \n\nAdditional riders such as the Drakethroat Glaive, or Caustic Band are the easiest examples of ways to boost it further.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\u2022 Compared to a Sorcadin/Bardadin, you won't have as many spell slots, though Hunter's Mark will offset this is managed well. \n\n\u2022 When you use Hunter's Mark, you may lose out on the extra bonus action attack from GWM. The Mark may not always be something you choose to do based on the context of the fight. In either case, you'll always get value from GWM thanks to the flat +10 damage. \n\n\u2022 Low wisdom means enemies will be more likely to save against the blind from your moths if you choose to use that ability instead of the damage. Glaives have the Lacerate ability which can impose disadvantage on con saves, which can help once per short rest.\n\n\u2022  The extra swarm damage can only be used once per round. \n\nOther Notes: \n\nIf you choose to lean more into the conditions your swarm can apply, such as Blind, Knockback, or Shock, then you'll probably want more Wisdom instead of Charisma. You can also use + Spell Save DC gear such as Melf's First Staff. Of course, those are 1d8 instead of 1d10. \n\nLet me know what you think!",
