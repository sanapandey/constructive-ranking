    "selftext": "Hello Guys,\n\nI am currently running a solo Lore Bard through honour mode so wanted to showcase how I have set up for the early game.\n\nFor me personally I do find it important to go all in on what a class has to offer and play around it to endear myself to my Tav. With that in mind I give you: THE TAVERN BRAWLER!\n\n**Sometimes, your at the local Tavern trying out some new material and its going down a stink, worse than Volo at the Goblin camp, and a brawl breaks out.**\n\nThankfully, we have:\n\n\\+9 to Athletics check with [Expertise](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Expertise_(passive_feature)) & [Elixir\\_of\\_Hill\\_Giant\\_Strength](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Elixir_of_Hill_Giant_Strength)\n\n\\+1d4  to all [Athletics](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Athletics) checks with [Disguise\\_Self](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Disguise_Self) & [Shapeshifters\\_Boon\\_Ring](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Shapeshifter%27s_Boon_Ring)\n\nAdvantage on all Athletics checks with [Enhance\\_Ability](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Enhance_Ability)\n\nFor our Feat we take [Tavern\\_Brawler](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Tavern_Brawler)\n\nFor Itemisation we take the usual [Crushers Ring](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Crusher%27s_Ring), [Haste\\_Helm](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Haste_Helm) & [Boots\\_of\\_Speed](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Boots_of_Speed)\n\nFor Illithid Powers, we rush [Displace](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Displace) and further enhance our throw damage with [Ring\\_of\\_Flinging](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Ring_of_Flinging)\n\nThe end result? \n\n17 Successful Athletics checks in a row:\n\n[LORE BARD - Shattered Sanctum Solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3q8whq5pRU)\n\nThanks for reading :)\n\n\n\n",
