That said, they are still allowed to wear metal and while they typically would adorn it with nature imagery, it could theoretically be plain metal. But I don't see any reason why this armor would be ancients paladin over other paladin subclasses (or heavy armor wielders in general).",

So ability improvement, savage attacker, the one that gives more battlemaster maneouvers, etc. \n\nFor abilities, I would go with tracking stuff (survival, investigation, nature) and/or Intimidation, Insight, Athletics and Persuasion. Character seems like the silent only speak when necessary and only what needs to be said type of character based on looks alone, of course, with RP you could easily do an extremely shy person that uses the armor to get confidence when talking to people xD\n\nAlternatively, you could do a fraud like character. If you ever saw the anime Eminence in Shadow, there is a secondary character there that uses gold armor and is full of himself, thing is, while it is true that character is undefeated...he only fought people weaker than him. Guy was quite charismatic and convincing in that ge knew what he was dping tho. Take this into the game and restrict yourself to only fight people of lower level than you and when you can't, have your character make mistakes in combat or run in panic trying to escape xD",
