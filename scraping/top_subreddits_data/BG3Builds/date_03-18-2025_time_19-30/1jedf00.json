It seems too good to not be a bug. \n\nIf it\u2019s not\u2026might as well use it to our advantage",

            "body": "The text of the shadow blade passive is pretty ambiguous. \n\n> You have Advantage on Attack rolls against Lightly or Heavily Obscured targets when using this blade.\n\nIt sounds like it's supposed to be just on attacks with the weapon itself, but it's not the unambiguous \"when attacking with this weapon,\" and there  are lots of cases where the game's language is imprecise or misleading otherwise. E.g.: \n\n> When the wielder attacks with Advantage, they deal an additional 1d8 Psychic.\n\nWhich clearly means \"everything\" as written but in game only means the weapon which grants that effect.\n\nIt would be very strong. It almost makes sense for casters, but the weapon is too good all on its own to also do that for spells.",

Which is why I was going off the wiki definition: \n\n> When you use the sword to attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the Attack Roll with Advantage.\n\nI agree the spell is already very strong, and I think it makes for some interesting theorycrafting for casters. \n\nIs this a viable dual wield option especially in the early acts with low accuracy? A decent alternative to the Melf\u2019s staff/spellsparkler combo for casters? Idk, but worth testing maybe.",

All game long, really, and definitely for anything with a 1 hex dip.\n\nAll the casters still want OK dex for AC and init and shadow blade is finesse and will frequently give advantage. Just put it in the offhand and it's an outstanding bonus action all game long. Any hexblade just binds it, then swaps hands for the same effect but super duper accuracy.",
