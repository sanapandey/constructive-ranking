Arcane Synergy Ring later will be triggered by Sorrowful Lash. Esnaring Strike your stun gun.\n\nBy Act 2 you can move to Spirit Guardians, Callous Glow helm of Acuity and Rat Bat, which has an insane interaction with Horde Breaker and condition spreader ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/s/mSfQtK2t2P) ). If there are 3 enemies in the Horde Breaker area, Rat Bat will damage and get RadOrb in all of them, which also will stack 6 Acuity from a single attack.",

I actually stumbled upon this when testing if death ward could keep Hope alive against Raphael's weird radiant retort in honor mode. (Haven't tested against the sharrans but maybe it works too!)\n\nAs another little remark (since people have already explored the more sane ideas in great detail :), you COULD consider that Contagion is effectively an \"instant kill\". It is absolutely hilarious to cast contagion (which does NOT need concentration and lasts through your rests) on the act3 bosses. Just use a high DC character (or break objects with arcane acuity helmet) and greater invisibility if you want and enjoy instantly killing bosses ;)",
