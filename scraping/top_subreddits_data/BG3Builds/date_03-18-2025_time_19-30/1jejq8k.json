Does it need rebalancing? \n",

Ideally have Sharpshooter feat on the gloomstalker (if playing as archer) and GWM on the paladin and battlemaster.\n\nFor the caster, what is your level split currently?  A 1/3 split either way absolutely works at low levels, but if you're 2/2 currently I'd respec.",

            "body": "Most of your characters are single class. That is fine. Actually that is typically ideal for low levels with few exceptions (e.g. warlock 2 + lore bard or sorc or something on an Eldritch blast build).\n\nThe tempest cleric/ice sorc build throws up red flags. Especially at such low levels. Multiclassing at low levels is again to be cautioned, and even moreso when mixing spellcasting attributes on a full caster build. As long as you are saying 1 Sorc for con save proficiency and 3 tempest cleric because that is your main class then cool. Or something along those lines. But if you are 2/2 that would be weird. \n\nRegardless this is is still more than capable of doing the goblin camp. I wouldn't even bat an eye with this party comp except for Dror Ragzlin on honour mode. The fight at the gate can be a lot if you don't go into it with a plan (e.g. do the fight from the structure above the gate, or use spike growth and funnel them all to you through that).",
