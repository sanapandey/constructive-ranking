    "selftext": "This is what my one and only Completed Run of BG3 ended up with.\n\nUnfortunately, that was Honor mode, so I can't reload and have fun. Should probably have thought of that before spending 145 hours doing everything I could.\n\nSo now I'm doing a custom run. Which is basically honor mode with multiple saves. So I can have fun with all the end game bosses. Ansur, Raphael, Cazador, and The Netherbrain.\n\nBut I want to be stronger. So I want some feedback on what I reached.\n\nLEVELS AND FEATS\n\nLevel 4 Draconic Sorcerer;\nTook the Alert feat. Nothing much of note here. This is only here for sorcery points, quicken spell and Con Save proficiency.\n\nLevel 4 Thief Rogue;\nTook the +2 Charisma. I'm wasting Sneak attack, but the extra bonus action, is cracked. Even better than the Action Surge of Fighter.\n\nLevel 4 Great Old One Warlock.\nTook Spell Sniper. Mortal Reminder, Eldritch Blast, Agonizing Blast, Repelling Blast.\n\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nBirthright - I feel like I made a mistake here. While this with the robe is very fashionable, you can reach 24 Charisma with 16 on Character Creation, +4 from ASI, +1 from Aunti Ethel, +3 from Mirror of Loss. Which leaves a spot for Helm of Grit for a 3rd bonus action. Just stock up on Potions of Angelic Slumber. Though I'm not sure if playing with 50% health is Viable.\n\nCloak of Displacement - With 18 AC, it almost feels like this is Mandatory. One of my few defensive items. \n\nPotent Robe - Something tells me this is BiS.\n\nCraterflesh Gloves - With a crit on 16-20 and advantage, I feel this is also BiS.\n\nHelldusk boots - I believe prone immunity is King. Prone makes ME lose a turn and drop concentration. Though my enemies feel like they just get up and do their turn anyway. But if there are better boots, please explain them to me.\n\nAmulet of Greater Health - Needed for the ring I use. Otherwise its impossible to concentrate on any spell. And it allows me to dump Con on Respec.\n\nRisky Ring - I believe this is BiS unless there is another way to consistently get advantage. If there is another equipment, please tell me.\n\nRing of Protection - I had 3 other party members, otherwise the callous glow ring would be here, instead of on MM Gale. Other than the Glow ring, any other good rings for this build?\n\nBloodthirst - for some reason you get 2 of this. This is for the crit. Could be replaced with Knife of the Undermountain King. Same crit effect, but looks cooler.\n\nRhapshody - The +3 to hit and damage puts it above spellsparkler imo. And I don't need the Feat to dual wield non-light weapons.\n\nThe Deadshot - Another Crit Reduction.\n\nElixir of Viciousness - I believe this is the best elixir due to bloodthirst not working with Illithid powers. Heroism conflicts the bless you get from the 5000gp statue. With a +14 to hit, Elixir of Battlemages Power seems to be diminishing returns. \n\n\nSPELLS: CONCENTRATION\n\nHex - my experience is that it feels like a waste. I keep having to transfer it in with my bonus actions. It never lasts more than a turn. Either the enemy is too weak and dies in one turn anyway, or is immune/resistant to necrotic damage. \n\nHaste - Replicated by a potion that can be thrown by a summon. Devestating if lost concentration, like with Netherbrain's Mindbroken. There's also the buggy Mind Sanctuary. Also with my current level split, I don't get 3rd level spell slots.\n\nDarkness - I'm stuck in one area. Would have to replace my repelling blast invocation, or use the ring that makes you immune to blind.\n\nBlur - I could get a different Cloak if I chose this to concentrate on.\n\n------------\n\nDo you have any thoughts to improving this build? Change in class levels taken? Subclasses? Feats? Equipment? Spells? Help would be greatly appreciated!\n",

The level 6 Elemental Affinity is useless. Are the other two subclasses' level 6 better for EB? \n\nFor Level 3 Sorc spells. I see counterspell and Haste. Any damage spell for me would just be outclassed by EB, especially with 3 castings a turn. Counterspell is nice. With a full caster Squad, Cazador just got bullied, same with Raphael. With Psionic Dominace, their turns were just countered. Haste is duplicated by a potion which i usually drop from my inventory and have a summon throw to me. (Thanks Gale) Or the Illithid power of Mind Sanctuary \n\nAngelic pots cost me next to nothing in Act 3. Circus lady restocks 1. I prepped 30 before the morphic pool. Every fight I went in with 33 sorcery points. More than enough for the 3 turns Emperor took to get to the crown and dominate it. And the 1 turn to kill the brain in the portal.",

Haste is good because you can twin it, speed pots only last for 3 rounds but usually that\u2019s all you need in HM. The draconic sorcery level 6 feature is nice if you ever want to do anything other than EB for damage but I guess that\u2019s not your vision.",

Champ would lower your crit threshold by one, but EK increases your ESL to level 5 which gives you two 3rd level spell slots. This allows you to make better use of both spell slot necklaces, and you can reclass hirelings/unused party members into wild magic barbarians to get 6 sorcery points from each of them per long rest. So the additional ESL gets you 6 more sorc points from the spell slots, an additional 2 sorc points from the necklaces, and 3 more per party member reclassed into a wild magic barbarian. All of that on top of allowing 5 eldritch blast casts in one turn once per short rest. I think that's worth sacrificing two feats.\n\nAnd it justifies the Birthright because you need the 2 extra rizz. So by my calculations you should be able to do 195-330 damage in a single turn before crits. And it only costs 6 sorc points, haste, and an action surge.",

You get all the sorc points you need in a fight with level 1 and 2 spell slots. No camp casters needed.\n\nIf I replace birthright with helm of grit, i could have 1 more quickened eldritch blast per turn. Better than action surge, which is only 1 per short rest. And with 4/4/4 in levels, I have 3 feats. One of which is spell sniper. Which will have the crit threshold reduction same as Champion fighter.\n\nI don't think the fighter inclusion is worth it.",
