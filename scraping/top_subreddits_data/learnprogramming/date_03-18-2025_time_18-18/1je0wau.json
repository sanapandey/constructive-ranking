But then I go to their career pages, and they\u2019re\u00a0*still*\u00a0hiring loads of software engineers.\n\nSo, what gives? If AI is about to replace human coders, why do they need to hire more of them right now? Are they just trolling us?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Let me know if I\u2019m missing something here.",

So generally you accept some risk to output something. Even a lot of planning etc for a new product features will have to be picked and other things set like code standards etc. \n\ngood code = does the job  \nwell written code may or may not do the job  \nbetter code = does the job and is written well  \ngreat code = documented, secure code, mock test design driven, no duplicate code, efficient use of resources, CI/CD, User friendly design and easy to use. Good logging etc, best in class for use case  \nperfect code = doesn't exist because everything has vulnerabilities and doesn't have everything else above already going for it. 100% coverage unit/integration etc (which time/money make basically impossible without AI helping) \n\nNow a lot of people get lost in this process. Some engineer teams will decide they need 80% code coverage in unit tests over everything, no matter what. Despite google having research that it depends on the languages and core use of them. Important things need to work but the business needs to make money and not go down. So it's a balance. \n\nDeepkseek is a good example of a team that did good engineering but deployed the website without proper database protection causing major issues and more trust impact. \n\nHowever that doesn't mean all teams need to have Voyager 1 level code that can run for 40 years without touching it either. That's an expensive process to plan out and a lot for stability over everything else. \n\nI've seen security people make similar mistakes and forget it's a business and you can't spend 1 million dollars to make 1 million dollars. \n\nI could go on with more examples of how it's a balance of risk but I think you get the point.",

Coding often isn't verifiable.\n\nIn isolation, specific algorithms are verifiable, but also these things aren't taking up the time of a lot of programmers. If I have a problem that's well defined with a consistent structure of inputs and outputs then I have... probably a library. Probably many libraries, in fact. No one writes quicksort anymore. The entire history of coding is encapsulating well defined problems so we don't have to write them anymore. We write functions so we don't need to write blocks of code anymore, etc.\n\nBut eventually, these well defined problems come up against unverifiable design decisions, which are the behavior you want the software to have. That's not a verifiable problem. A piece of software like \"Facebook\" isn't verifiable. You can't train an AI to make the most quantifiably facebooky facebook. The choice of behavior isn't verifiable, only the implementation of that behavior is.\n\nBut again, all of the history of programming has already been to abstract away the well-defined implementation details so that code focuses primarily on the behavior itself. Like, most of us don't allocate memory anymore. That's a well defined implementation detail we've abstracted away already. AI can further bridge that gap so that more of what we do focuses only on the non-verifiable creative output of defining behavior, but as professionals get more experienced, the implementation details get easier and more and more of our thought and energy is focused on behavior decisions.\n\nWhen you're learning, you're typically recreating solutions like a basic to-do app, where there are few behavior decisions to make, and they're not emphasized, so you can focus on implementation, so a beginner might think coding is almost entirely implementation, but that just isn't so.\n\nFull disclosure, I think short term AI will definitely suppress jobs and wages, and I think it explains at least a significant portion of the losses we've already seen there. It can make developers more productive, so you need fewer to create the same amount of work. Long term, though? We often say that most companies see developers as a cost-center, and it's often constrained by budget, rather than need. That's a situation where induced demand is likely. As programmers become more productive, I think we'll find companies eventually just bring back their budgets or even increase them eventually as they get more bang for their buck.",

If it were art, it would be an artist that makes mosaics, but isn't able to cut their own tiles.\n\nFor small, well-documented tasks, AI is great.  Perfect for pushing out boiler-plate stuff that has been widely documented all over the internet.  \n\nI was in a role where they let us use copilot.  The code was responsible for controlling high-end cameras that get strapped to the bottom of airplanes by routing a number of digital signals and controlling very expensive linear actuators.  At a high-level, copilot was useful.  Once you got down into the weeds, it did batshit things and generated code that would have leaked memory everywhere and lost hardware references.  Flight time is expensive, so having a system freeze or crash while the plane is in the air is a fucking expensive mistake.\n\nBut it *looked correct*.  That's the scary thing about working with AI-generated code:  it always generates code that *looks right*.  This is distinct from code that *is right*.   As a human developer that understands what's going on, I could look over the AI generated code and say, \"hold on, that's a bad idea,\" and then go fix things.\n\nThere's a lot of hype and great marketing about AI's capabilities.  It is kind of scary seeing how many decision makers are buying into the hype.  I guess as long as they stick to producing inconsequential apps we'll be ok, but if someone who oversees important infrastructure or medical systems gives this a whirl, people are going to get hurt.",
