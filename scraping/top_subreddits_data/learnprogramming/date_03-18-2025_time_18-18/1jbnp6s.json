Feel free to share updates on projects you're working on, brag about any major milestones you've hit, grouse about a challenge you've ran into recently... Any sort of \"progress report\" is fair game!\n\nA few requests:\n\n1. If possible, include a link to your source code when sharing a project update. That way, others can learn from your work!\n\n2. If you've shared something, try commenting on at least one other update -- ask a question, give feedback, compliment something cool... We encourage discussion!\n\n3. If you don't consider yourself to be a beginner, include about how many years of experience you have.\n\nThis thread will remained stickied over the weekend.

Of course it's still early and I am still learning the quirks of the language but I'd say it's going well. I'm in a sort of honeymoon phase with the language.
