    "selftext": "# The summary we\u2019ve put together through our collective efforts is down below in the post. \ud83d\ude80\n\nI've been a frontend developer for 4 years and grew into a senior full-stack. I've explored **a multitude of technologies** and development principles, and I keep diving into even more.\n\n**But that's not the point.** I feel like my life as a developer is flat. Some days I love my job, some days I hate it, but in the end \u2014 nothing really changes.\n\nI realized early that **programmers don\u2019t work 8 hours a day** \u2014 their real productive time is about 3-4 hours. And during these hours, you just sit in an empty room, staring at the screen. That feels terrible.\n\nYes, you can enjoy contributing to open-source, improving projects, and writing clean code. But looking back, you see the same picture \u2014 **just sitting in front of a computer.**\n\nTo be honest, the **flow state makes this feeling even worse**. Because then time moves even faster, and while in those moments I complete more tasks and feel more satisfied with myself, I also realize that I\u2019ve burned through a huge number of hours without even noticing them. How can you be happy about that?\n\nI spend my free time on self-improvement in programming. For example, I recently read about fiber optics, and it was truly fascinating. But once again, I was just sitting in a room, **staring at an e-book\u2026**\n\nI once asked myself at the end of the day, \u201c**Would I want to relive this day?**\u201d Even on a good day, the answer was \"no.\"\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, but it feels like having fun outside of work doesn\u2019t really change the situation because you still spend the majority of your day just sitting in front of a screen\u2026 You just try to make the rest of the time enjoyable. I used to live this way, believing that if you need fun outside of work, then maybe it's not the right profession for you. In the end, though, **isn\u2019t the attempt to brighten up the evening just a painkiller for the routine itself**?\n\nDo you guys feel the same, or am I being too categorical?\n\nBut it looks like **I have enjoyment**, yet **I don't have meaning**.\n\n*I've stared at my screen for four hours a day,*  \n*Once, debugging was joyful, a game I would play.*  \n*But gazing at days as they sink in the sea,*  \n*I see only echoes, no meaning for me.*\n\n# UPD: RESULT OF DISCUSSION IS HERE \n\nHey guys, here we go again!\n\nThere have been so many responses that I wouldn\u2019t have enough time in a full workday to reply to each of you individually. So, for those who come across this post, I\u2019ll summarize the key takeaways I\u2019ve gathered. Let\u2019s dive in:\n\n**What you\u2019re feeling is completely normal.**\u00a0A huge (!!!) number of people have shared that they feel exactly the same way. So, you\u2019re not alone in this (yes, it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but when you see real stories proving it, it actually resonates). Not every response will apply to everyone, but I hope you find something that helps!\n\n# Direct Solutions to the Problem\n\nI consider these direct solutions if there are no underlying issues like burnout or depression.\n\n1. **Try a hybrid work mode.**\u00a0If you\u2019re working remotely, try going to the office. If you\u2019re already in an office, switch it up\u2014work from a caf\u00e9, a coworking space, a park, or even a forest. This small change can genuinely make a difference. If the root of your issue is monotony or isolation, changing your environment could be the simplest way to regain motivation.\n2. **Explore a new subfield or company.**\u00a0If your work feels meaningless, try shifting to a field that excites you. Some programmers find inspiration in bioinformatics, robotics, or IoT, where software has tangible real-world applications. Maybe mentorship or management is a better fit for you? Or perhaps your current company is just not the right place? Fintech, for example, is notorious for its repetitive and uninspiring tasks. If you find yourself stuck in such a situation, switching industries could make programming feel engaging again.\n3. **Consider working with a different team.**\u00a0Your team makes a huge difference. Being surrounded by smart, ambitious, and fun people who are working toward something meaningful can compensate for a lot of the downsides of programming. If your work feels dull, maybe it's not the work itself\u2014it\u2019s the people around you.\n4. **Think of work not as your identity, but as a tool.**\u00a0Your job doesn\u2019t have to define you. It can simply be a way to earn money, invest, and maybe even retire early. This mindset shift helps many people regain control over their perspective on work. If you no longer view your job as a source of ultimate fulfillment, it can free you from unnecessary frustration.\n5. **Find meaning.** Really, maybe you just need to find meaning in what you do, and then this downside won\u2019t feel like a downside at all. There are countless different philosophies, but for me\u2014and for many of the people I talked to in the comments\u2014Viktor Frankl\u2019s philosophy stands out. His book *\"Man\u2019s Search for Meaning\"* is truly remarkable in this regard.\n\n# Indirect Factors That May Be Contributing\n\nThese solutions can help if there are underlying factors subtly shaping your worldview.\n\n1. **Maybe you just need a break.**\u00a0Sometimes, what feels like a deep dissatisfaction with your career is actually burnout or even depression creeping in. Ask yourself \u2014 have you always felt this way? Or did these thoughts start appearing recently? A vacation, a sabbatical, or even just a few days off to reset might be exactly what you need.\n2. **Don\u2019t try to make work the meaning of your life.**\u00a0You\u2019re human \u2014 you need rest, variety, and different experiences. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re bad at your job or don\u2019t love it enough. If you\u2019re feeling like programming is your entire life and you\u2019re exhausted, then the problem isn\u2019t the job\u2014it\u2019s the lack of balance. Taking breaks and diversifying your daily activities can help restore your passion.\n3. **Appreciate what you have.**\u00a0Many pointed out that we should be grateful for what we have, and that makes sense. 90% of jobs involve staring at a screen all day, and that\u2019s not going away anytime soon. The difference? Many of them pay 2-3 times less than the average IT salary. But not all of them. If you truly want to leave, no one will stop you\u2014because there are always those 10% of jobs that break the mold. However, before making any drastic decisions, it's worth reflecting on what you might be taking for granted.\n4. **Find a hobby (if you don\u2019t already have one).**\u00a0Many programmers shared that they got into music, gardening, or an incredible variety of other interests. At first, these hobbies seemed like ways to distance themselves from programming, but in the end, they only made their lives better! If you\u2019re feeling drained by your work, it might not be programming itself\u2014it might just be the lack of fulfilling activities outside of it.\n5. **Maybe you feel disconnected from your own work.**\u00a0Marx\u2019s Theory of Alienation describes how workers can become detached from the meaning of their labor, which leads to dissatisfaction. This might be exactly what you\u2019re experiencing. If your work feels pointless, it may be due to a lack of ownership over what you create, rather than the field itself being unfulfilling. You can read more here:\u00a0[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s\\_theory\\_of\\_alienation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation)\n6. **Look at other fields.**\u00a0If your dissatisfaction isn\u2019t just a passing phase, maybe it\u2019s worth exploring other industries. That doesn\u2019t mean quitting right away\u2014you can continue working while staying open to new experiences. And in the meantime, be grateful that your current job allows you to earn well while you explore other options.\n\nThat\u2019s about it. There were also plenty of people who don\u2019t struggle with this at all and feel completely fine in their roles \u2014 so let\u2019s not ignore that perspective either!\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m choosing a strategy based on points\u00a0**1, 4 and 5**\u00a0from the direct solutions, and\u00a0**1, 2, 3, 5, and 6**\u00a0from the indirect solutions.\n\n# I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who took part in this discussion.\n\n**P.S.**\u00a0Throughout all of this, I\u2019ve been using GPT to translate my responses because my English isn\u2019t strong enough for discussions this big. I simply asked it to turn my words into coherent English text. This is a response to the guys who were testing the auto-reply in the comments and thought they were talking to an AI.",

Maybe just for the thrills and sense of freedom. My life has been boring as shit since I finished college and started working. I realise I hate programming for the corpos. Just another busy bee in their huge money making machine. \n\nIf they make me redundant, I\u2019ll be honest I\u2019ll be absolutely terrified but somewhat\u2026 free? I hope. I never knew I was signing up JIRA tickets, sprint ceremonies and all this corpo filler. This isn\u2019t my life and me. I don\u2019t want it.\n\nI never started programming for some corpo who pretends to care about me, I started it for game development all those years ago and just miss programming for myself as a hobby so much. \n\nIf I do get made redundant, I\u2019m gonna find some part time job in the meantime and do some game development for once. Give myself a year to complete a couple projects. When that most likely fails, I\u2019ll start looking for full time jobs again. \n\nI\u2019m gonna give myself a well deserved long break. Been working full time since 18. Time flies, I\u2019m 24, life is flying by I aint got time for all this corpo stuff anymore I don\u2019t care that they pay me well, my life has been monotonous and dull since starting this job. \n\nHad to tell someone idk bro.",

I don't think I have a very healthy mindset about it overall but I was just saying that it's appealing to me, for better or for worse.\n\nFor me I see it more like challenging myself, for most of my life I've been bored and not challenged by much. For instance my go to for games are fighting games, especially Tekken. I will say fighting games are somewhat unique because they're often played in person and have a more social aspect than other games. However when I get a chance I love sitting and practicing my character, not even playing against others. I enjoy sitting in the practice room and studying frame data, practicing blocking and movement drills, combos, etc. Even when I am playing online it may be against different players, but in intermediate skill brackets at least they often play the same. That means the only real factor that changes is me.\n\nI love coding because you're always getting feedback on what you're doing, whether it's positive or negative. There are always opportunities to learn something, figure something out or explore the endless rabbit holes that come with it. \n\nI only code as a hobby though, I've never been employed for programming and haven't gone to school for it so our experiences are likely different. Things will always get mundane when you're doing it out of necessity, I think that's what you're experiencing now that you're in it. You may have enjoyed it when you were voluntarily doing it but now that it's expected it's starting to lose its shine. At a point you just have to decide if something is for you, I've had that with a couple different career paths that I thought I was really in to ear first. This is one reason I've been hesitant to pursue education for CS or similar. I've been coding as a hobby for years and I love tweaking my Linux install and editing configs, writing scripts, etc, but I worry I'll end up feeling the same way if I pursue it.",

You invest meaning into it \u2014 the meaning of self-improvement. And to me, the clearest sign of that is the fact that you don\u2019t just play online all the time, but also train alone.\n\nActually, I didn\u2019t study programming in school either\u2014I only considered it when I went to university. Throughout my entire childhood and school years, I was deeply immersed in video games.\n\nBy the way, I barely remember my childhood and youth. There was an overwhelming amount of pleasure (video games), yet very few moments truly stuck in my memory.\n\nThe most vivid period of my life was my university years \u2014 that\u2019s when I realized that \"sitting at a computer\" is far from everything life has to offer.\n\nBut the fact that you find meaning in it only reinforces my belief that meaning is something beyond lexical or logical description.\n\nYou probably wouldn\u2019t be able to fully convey your meaning to me, just as I wouldn\u2019t be able to convey mine to you.\n\n\n\nAs for your observations about **Linux** \u2014 I think you have nothing to worry about either way.\n\nEven if you eventually decide not to pursue CS, no one can take away the skills you\u2019ve already built.\n\nI\u2019ve always admired developers for whom programming is a hobby rather than just a necessity.\n\nBecause in that case, you can clearly see genuine interest.\n\nAnd more often than not, **interest is the seed of true skill.**",

I hope I have those experiences as well if I do. I don't have much of a social life, I moved to a new area and have struggled to find people with similar interests so I think I find comfort in \"sitting at the computer\" as well.\n\nOne thing I can say about hobby programming in my experience is that there are huge lapses in my knowledge due to the nature of self learning. I typically learn new things because they pique my particular interest or I need them to fix a problem. I see where more structured schooling can be very beneficial.\n\nI can also say I'm not the most skilled programmer by any means, I have trouble really sticking to one thing which has left me at ~ intermediate level in a lot of different languages and implementations, but I don't feel I'm good enough to be employable.\n\nAnother word of advice I can offer is that I think when you're younger you tend to put most of your meaning to your job. I'm in my mid 20s now and I know I'm not old or anything but through time and experience I've learned to make work the least significant part of my life, because it's just, work. \n\nPerhaps you should try to write some things for yourself, on YouTube I watch the primeagen a lot and he recommends that every programmer should \"build their own text editor\" at some point, amongst other small projects. This doesn't necessarily mean writing it from scratch (coding your text editor in a text editor, lol) but could mean using something like nvim or emacs that comes as a pretty blank slate and config everything your way. It seems like it would be very satisfying because it will be something you use often and you'll always know you built it the way you wanted it.",

Kinda.\n\nAs for meaning, there is no intrinsic meaning to anything in life so you have to create it for yourself.\n\nIt's different when you're working on software you care about, for customers you care about, or an organization that you care about.\n\nIt's very different when it's a young fast-growing company that's making a real impact.\n\nThen the work itself, the lines of code you write, is secondary to the job, which is to help your customers thrive or the business grow. And it feels good to be needed, and write code every day that helps unblock people internally, or externally.\n\nIf you're too far removed from making an impact on the company, or its customers... use your chops to secure a position somewhere else where the code-writing matters.. in a way that is meaningful to you.\n\nBecause the job itself won't change. But the circumstances can. Mentorship and learning, growth, momentum, exciting product launches, travel & social engagements, conferences, interfacing with real people and customers, different teams (it, hr, sales, marketing, design) and putting your skill to use, getting rewarded for it, that's what makes it fun (for me).\n\nSome devs hate this aspect, they just want to be left alone to write code. That's fine. That's how they find meaning. Deep down, we all seek meaning though, you're just wired to seek it a different way. So go out there and apply your skills where you can find both fulfillment and meaning.\n\nSome people will say finding meaning in work is pointless, that your life and work have to be separate. I don't think it's black and white, you just have to cultivate some balance. Work can never provide total and complete meaning in a healthy way. But it can certainly provide some, and it's usually when you feel your work matters, most simply when it directly helps someone else.",

Programming didn't happen until late twenties almost 30, as I was tired of working phone jobs (customer service and collections). I originally was going for electrical engineering but then found I liked writing code more. It was just cool to type words and have them do things. I had at least some creativity in coding as there were different ways to do things. I never had that in my prior butt-in-seat jobs. I had gotten less into music for a while in my twenties, dealing with girlfriends and such. When I finally got back into music later, I got deep into it. I originally got into hardware boxes and samplers because I was getting tendinitis in my arm that scared me into thinking I'd have to stop playing guitar. Besides learning drums, I started exploring sequencing, sampling and sound design.\n\nI'd say DAW and DAW-less are two different worlds. The main reason people talk about going with hardware and DAW-less is that most of them are coders that stare at a screen all day. Having tangible controls and not depending on a screen is liberating. Also, you can just create small chunks of music. Layer a 4 or 8 bar clip rather than all the time needed to complete a full song. From that perspective, you can go as simple as you want and fit it into a small chunk of time. It is fun to take a battery powered box out to the park and just create there.\n\nIn fairness, because I love song-writing, I have come back to a DAW more recently to start back on full songs. I still prefer to write parts on hardware and arrange there and then fill out and finish with the power of software. I need to separate creating from all the small details of mixing.\n\nFinal point is to get some analog in your life to battle the digital oppression. I love a glass of whiskey and listening to a vinyl at the end of a day. Good stuff.",

That's what sent me down the vinyl path, but also has some good philosophical points on the value of anything from board games to film photography. It basically speaks to why digital can leave us unfulfilled and how to get some of that back with some balance.\n\nAs for the tendinitis, it has improved a lot. Full disclosure. When I got heavily back into music, it came after a late in life return to faith in God after exploring the evidence (taboo on Reddit I know). That is my main source of meaning btw. But I started playing every week at church. When the arm was bad, I just had to rest it except for rehearsal night and Sunday. Eventually it started to improve. Nowadays, it is well controlled. I can play guitar almost daily without issue. The only thing that troubles it is playing bass guitar. I did learn some specific massage while stretching techniques that help if it acts up a little. \n\nAs for having much music out there, I don't have a lot. A few drastically different worship tunes (one southern rock and the other electronic based) and a couple other random genre tunes. I've only very recently (like this month) gotten to a level with a good mic and nice plugins to be able to record high quality mixes, so hope to record more ideas in several genres. I'd like to write some instrumental electronic tracks to skate to. I moved from in-line skates to these challenging things called free skates. That's a whole other conversation. :)\n\nI definitely hope you find your niche and more fulfillment. Life is too short to live like a zombie.",

            "body": "I think about this sometimes too. I just found out last week that I got accepted to a BIG internship, and I was (and still kind of am) ecstatic looking through the things I might be working on. But at some points, it just doesn\u2019t feel fulfilling enough. Like, I know I\u2019ll learn a lot, but when I think too hard about it, it all starts to feel kind of insignificant.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t mind the whole sitting in front of a screen part...at least I haven\u2019t thought about it much. My main concern is that if I end up as a fullstack dev, I\u2019ll probably work on things that won\u2019t significantly impact people\u2019s lives. At best, I might roll out a feature that streamlines a process or increases efficiency at my company, but was that feature really necessary? A lot of what gets done in corporate isn\u2019t essential. It might not even be that important. People do it to stay relevant, to create an illusion of progress that keeps the business moving, even if the progress itself isn\u2019t meaningful.\n\nI feel the same way about a lot of these startups that seem to add little to no real value to most people\u2019s lives (at least in my opinion). Sometimes, I think I could never dedicate my youth and life to something like that. But then again, when you look at these founders, you can tell it\u2019s really meaningful to them. They believe in what they\u2019re doing. And maybe they\u2019re right\u2014maybe what they\u2019re building does have a big impact.\n\nI remember watching an interview where comedian Bill Burr said something like, \"We should\u2019ve stopped inventing after cars in the 1990s. We don\u2019t need anything more than that.\" But I guess we keep going because of our innate need for stimulation. We\u2019re unfortunately too intelligent to ever be fully free from it. Traits like curiosity and creativity led to the Industrial Revolution, and as long as humanity survives, we\u2019ll carry on doing what we do\u2014because that\u2019s just in our nature. Our incremental, seemingly meaningless improvements add up over thousands of years, across millions of people, and that\u2019s what keeps humanity moving forward.\n\nAs for meaning, I don\u2019t think life has any inherent meaning. I can only even ask this question because I\u2019m in a position of privilege. When I think about a kid who died of cancer, or people in war-torn countries, or young lives lost to natural disasters, I can\u2019t help but wonder, what was their meaning in life? Many of them never even got the chance to think about what was meaningful for them. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making sense, but since I believe there is no absolute meaning, I just live my life based on temporary, self-made meanings.\n\nRight now, that meaning is this internship. I worked really hard for it, and it means I\u2019ll earn a lot of money over the summer\u2014enough to be financially set until I graduate. I can even help my parents a bit (and finally buy that fancy bike I\u2019ve been eyeing for two years now, lol). I\u2019m content and really looking forward to the work. But maybe in 2\u20133 years, I\u2019ll start losing this sense of meaning again. Maybe then I\u2019ll want to do something different\u2014go to grad school, challenge myself with real world problems, or finally start working on my dream game. Who knows? That\u2019s for future me to figure out.\n\nRight now, my meaning is simply looking forward to the next couple of years not being broke af, helping my family and my girlfriend, being debt-free, enjoying some hobbies, and eating a lot of good food.\n\nAs for the whole idea of \"remembering the days\" or making them distinguishable, I don\u2019t think any job, or any activity, will ever make us remember every single week. Most of us don\u2019t even remember last week unless something particularly eventful happened. I think that\u2019s just how humans are wired. Our brains filter out non-essential memories for efficiency, the same way we simplify, assume, and stereotype\u2014because we don\u2019t need all that information, just enough to get by. And that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s just how we function.\n\nI think I\u2019ve been yapping for too long, so I\u2019ll end with one of my favorite quotes from one of my fav shows!\n\n\"Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody\u2019s going to die. Come watch TV.\"  \n\u2014 Morty, Rick and Morty",

We all have personal and professional values that guide our decisions\u2014whether in work, relationships, or friendships. Sometimes, reflecting on what truly matters to you and comparing it with your company\u2019s values can help you understand why you\u2019re not enjoying your job or why it feels meaningless.\n\nFor example, freedom and flexibility are really important to me. That\u2019s why I always look for jobs with flexible hours, remote options, or I work for myself. That way, I feel happy. But my sister, on the other hand, loves having a fixed schedule and couldn\u2019t work the way I do. Everyone is different\u2014what matters is finding what suits you.\n\nProgramming is my second career (I\u2019m just starting out in this field), and I once had a job where my director\u2019s only goal was to make money at the end of the day. He didn\u2019t care if the service we provided was good or bad, as long as clients paid. It wasn\u2019t just the company; it was his mindset, and it made me miserable. I left that job. For me, it matters. If I\u2019m providing a service, I want it to actually help people, not just be a way to make money.\n\nA great exercise is to reflect on your core values and, when looking for a job, try to align with the ones that matter most to you (not always is possible to match them all). This can give you clarity on what\u2019s missing in your professional life and help you make better choices.",

I've concluded for myself that even if I spent every waking hour of life dancing with the woman of my dreams, laughing, helping people, and feeling those emotions of deep satisfaction--death would still loom in the back of my mind.  That anxious feeling of not doing or achieving enough.  \"Wasting time\".  Or maybe if life was so perfect, you'd switch from grieving time wasted to grieving the inevitable loss of something so beautiful and perfect.  I'd recommend focusing on finding internal peace as opposed to orchestrating an external reality that satisfies that anxiety of \"wasting time\".  At the very least, seek internal peace while trying to find an external life that satisfies you more.  But be careful, the brain will always find something to be anxious about \ud83d\ude09.",

            "body": "Hey guys, here we go again!\n\nThere have been so many responses that I wouldn\u2019t have enough time in a full workday to reply to each of you individually. So, for those who come across this post, I\u2019ll summarize the key takeaways I\u2019ve gathered. Let\u2019s dive in:  \n  \n**What you\u2019re feeling is completely normal.** A huge (!!!) number of people have shared that they feel exactly the same way. So, you\u2019re not alone in this (yes, it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but when you see real stories proving it, it actually resonates). Not every response will apply to everyone, but I hope you find something that helps!\n\n# Direct Solutions to the Problem\n\nI consider these direct solutions if there are no underlying issues like burnout or depression.\n\n1. **Try a hybrid work mode.** If you\u2019re working remotely, try going to the office. If you\u2019re already in an office, switch it up\u2014work from a caf\u00e9, a coworking space, a park, or even a forest. This small change can genuinely make a difference. If the root of your issue is monotony or isolation, changing your environment could be the simplest way to regain motivation.\n2. **Explore a new subfield or company.** If your work feels meaningless, try shifting to a field that excites you. Some programmers find inspiration in bioinformatics, robotics, or IoT, where software has tangible real-world applications. Maybe mentorship or management is a better fit for you? Or perhaps your current company is just not the right place? Fintech, for example, is notorious for its repetitive and uninspiring tasks. If you find yourself stuck in such a situation, switching industries could make programming feel engaging again.\n3. **Consider working with a different team.** Your team makes a huge difference. Being surrounded by smart, ambitious, and fun people who are working toward something meaningful can compensate for a lot of the downsides of programming. If your work feels dull, maybe it's not the work itself\u2014it\u2019s the people around you.\n4. **Think of work not as your identity, but as a tool.** Your job doesn\u2019t have to define you. It can simply be a way to earn money, invest, and maybe even retire early. This mindset shift helps many people regain control over their perspective on work. If you no longer view your job as a source of ultimate fulfillment, it can free you from unnecessary frustration.",

            "body": "# Indirect Factors That May Be Contributing\n\nThese solutions can help if there are underlying factors subtly shaping your worldview.\n\n1. **Maybe you just need a break.** Sometimes, what feels like a deep dissatisfaction with your career is actually burnout or even depression creeping in. Ask yourself \u2014 have you always felt this way? Or did these thoughts start appearing recently? A vacation, a sabbatical, or even just a few days off to reset might be exactly what you need.\n2. **Don\u2019t try to make work the meaning of your life.** You\u2019re human \u2014 you need rest, variety, and different experiences. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re bad at your job or don\u2019t love it enough. If you\u2019re feeling like programming is your entire life and you\u2019re exhausted, then the problem isn\u2019t the job\u2014it\u2019s the lack of balance. Taking breaks and diversifying your daily activities can help restore your passion.\n3. **Appreciate what you have.** Many pointed out that we should be grateful for what we have, and that makes sense. 90% of jobs involve staring at a screen all day, and that\u2019s not going away anytime soon. The difference? Many of them pay 2-3 times less than the average IT salary. But not all of them. If you truly want to leave, no one will stop you\u2014because there are always those 10% of jobs that break the mold. However, before making any drastic decisions, it's worth reflecting on what you might be taking for granted.\n4. **Find a hobby (if you don\u2019t already have one).** Many programmers shared that they got into music, gardening, or an incredible variety of other interests. At first, these hobbies seemed like ways to distance themselves from programming, but in the end, they only made their lives better! If you\u2019re feeling drained by your work, it might not be programming itself\u2014it might just be the lack of fulfilling activities outside of it.\n5. **Maybe you feel disconnected from your own work.** Marx\u2019s Theory of Alienation describes how workers can become detached from the meaning of their labor, which leads to dissatisfaction. This might be exactly what you\u2019re experiencing. If your work feels pointless, it may be due to a lack of ownership over what you create, rather than the field itself being unfulfilling. You can read more here: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s\\_theory\\_of\\_alienation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation)\n6. **Look at other fields.** If your dissatisfaction isn\u2019t just a passing phase, maybe it\u2019s worth exploring other industries. That doesn\u2019t mean quitting right away\u2014you can continue working while staying open to new experiences. And in the meantime, be grateful that your current job allows you to earn well while you explore other options.\n\nThat\u2019s about it. There were also plenty of people who don\u2019t struggle with this at all and feel completely fine in their roles \u2014 so let\u2019s not ignore that perspective either!\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m choosing a strategy based on points **1 and 4** from the direct solutions, and **1, 2, 3, 5, and 6** from the indirect solutions.\n\n# I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who took part in this discussion.\n\n**P.S.** Throughout all of this, I\u2019ve been using GPT to translate my responses because my English isn\u2019t strong enough for discussions this big. I simply asked it to turn my words into coherent English text. This is a response to the guys who were testing the auto-reply in the comments and thought they were talking to an AI.",

It seems like you also are gaming so I think the biggest factor is that potentially fighting burnout by balancing your time without a screen. I strongly recommend a combat sport. If you are into nerd things, HEMA (aka sword fighting) is a good place to start.\n\nYou can find true fulfillment from your work, from your hobbies outside of work, or both. But if you\u2019re not getting true fulfillment from either, then you need to figure out where you can get fulfillment from and balance that against making enough money to be comfortable and not stressed about finances.",
