    "selftext": "Hey there, I\u2019m searching through old posts and such. I\u2019m pushing 50, auDHD, several learning disabilities, and I\u2019m wanting to learn programming at a slow pace. Mostly it\u2019s for the sake of learning and maybe creating some apps. \n\nI\u2019m teaching my kids some tech in our hobby interests, and I figured we could all learn together.\n\nI\u2019m interested in Data Management, Machine Learning, AI ethics, AI for use in help to others (service to others?).\n\nI\u2019m going to take my time, but it\u2019s always been something fascinating for me, I figure now in the second half of life, I can pursue my interests.\n\nSo, programmers, what is a good place to start? I\u2019m not sure what language(s) should be the beginning, but I hear python.\n\nI literally need it explained like I\u2019m 5, with a lot of repetition until I get it. Step by literal step.\n\nThank you in advance for the help!",
