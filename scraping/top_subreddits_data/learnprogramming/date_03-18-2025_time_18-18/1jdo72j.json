It is an indication of learning.**\n\nI see some people having trouble learning a new skill and then thinking to themselves, \"Maybe I'm not cut out for this.\" But I'd argue that there is no such thing.\n\nNobody is born with knowledge. These things are acquired. The more you enjoy a topic, the easier it will be to learn, but there is no such thing as \"too difficult for me as a person.\" Every problem can be broken down into more manageable segments, each teaching you a piece of the bigger puzzle.\n\nOf course, if programming, or a specific subset of it, is not enjoyable to you, that is  a valid reason to stop pursuing it. But make sure you don't confuse the natural struggle of learning with a lack of enjoyment.\n\nEdit: I thought this was obvious but here it is: Yes i know we don't have superpowers. \"Skill\" was reffering to an abillity already previously accuired by someone else in the past.",

I _could_ spend years banging my head against the wall trying to learn, and I would eventually succeed, but it'll be so much easier to find someone who can help with that skill. My time is better spent elsewhere. I'll still do my best and try to learn but that is not a talent I have.",

            "body": "\n> The more you enjoy a topic, the easier it will be to learn.\n\nThat's it, right THERE.\n\nI started programming as a child, in the 90s, because the entire concept was like an entire universe of possibilities had been opened up to me. A computer, and me being able to tell it what to do, what I wanted it to do? That means that I could make *ANYTHING* happen, without buying raw materials, without working any harder than just thinking and typing. There's no wrenching or sawing or welding or any of that. I could make *ANYTHING*, with just some ideas and time.\n\n...and, I don't have to buy more materials for someone else to enjoy the fruits of my labor! I can just make a copy of my wares. Nowadays it's upload the thing for people to download it, but same difference. They're just making copies for themselves by downloading it. Making a program is making a machine that is virtual, that can be copied infinitely, because it exists only as information, as instructions, for a digital machine to execute.\n\nA computer can read and write *ANYTHING* to/from storage or over a network connection, interpret and process user keyboard/mouse/touchscreen/gyro/accelerometer/microphone/gamepad input in an infinite number of ways, set the colors of pixels on the screen to any imaginable combination, and generate audio of every imaginable combination of frequency coefficients in any imaginable patterns. A computer is a universal input/output device. You can transform any input into any output that you can fathom (depending on compute constraints, but as far as newbies are concerned: for all practical purposes and intents it is basically unlimited).\n\nIf the prospect of having every digital machine on the planet as your blank canvas for you to make *ANYTHING* happen on isn't enough to inspire you as to endure whatever challenges you must overcome in order to be able to make these computing devices do *ANYTHING* then programming isn't for you - because that's what programming is for, and that's what it's all about. Programming is about making stuff happen. If you don't want to make anything happen, if you literally have zero ideas as to what you would want a universal input/output machine to do, then programming isn't for you. If someone gives you a blank canvas and a rainbow of colors and you can't think of a single thing to do with that, then painting isn't for you either. Programming is the same thing, it's just a blank canvas (the computer/phone/tablet/headset/etcetera) and your palette of colors (the language and APIs you harness). You can do anything you want with user input, there are basically no restrictions (that matter), and you can do anything you want with the display, and the speakers, and what is sent/received over the network/internet connection. How is that not enough to inspire anybody to dive into coding, is my question.\n\nMy whole theory is that the bloated dinosaur hyper-text-based internet paradigm we have today has completely destroyed a generation of would-be-coding-geniuses, by completely turning them off to the idea of programming at all - when they never were actually exposed to programming in the first place. All that they saw was HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and maybe another \"WeBsTaCk TeChNoLoGy\" in there. Webstack is not programming. Webstack is invariably destined to go the way of the dinosaur because it's highly inefficient, highly ineffective, and highly deterimental to software engineering as a whole. If your wares must run in a browser, then you're not programming. If you're writing a browser, now you're programming. See the difference?\n\nThe very fact that \"wEbStAcK\" is even a thing in the first place is a huge glaring red flag that something has gone horribly wrong with computing and software development. So-called \"Hyper-Text\" (doesn't that sound quaint, like \"cyberspace\", or \"super-information-highway\", or \"hyper-link\"?) was invented decades ago, and it's an antique. Everything that browsers do today is confined to that antique paradigm. Conversely, everything that websites do is also confined to that paradigm. It's a self-propagating travesty.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause we agree that it should be. We just accept it as \"the way things are\", and don't even dare dreaming of bigger and better things.\n\nI say nay. Devices the world over can be put to much better use with a modern paradigm. The future of the internet precludes all-things-hypertext. My dream for the last 13 years has been a web \"browser\" (quaint antique terminology, again) that is more like a game engine, and that removes the server-farming-middle-men-incorporated who only serve as a security vulnerability, a privacy invader, and censor, from the equation. The future of the internet is a p2p \"browser\" (or whatever you want to call it) that makes optimal efficient use of users' devices and hardware to present web applications, games, and software, unlike today's browsers - which are completely back-asswards from how things should be.\n\nWebstack is a joke. If you're learning webstack and you feel like programming isn't for you, it's because webstack isn't for anyone. It's a layercake of technological afterthoughts that have piled up for 3 decades that is inevitably destined for the history books. Do yourself a favor and learn a real language that lets you do real stuff on a device, and then you'll be inspired. The learning will come naturally from within - you won't even be able to help it. Then we can see which one of us ends up building the future of the internet - because hypertext transfer protocols and markup languages and  \"2d DoCuMeNt ObJeCt MoDeLs\" AIN'T IT.\n\n:]",
