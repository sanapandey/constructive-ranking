            "body": "I'm probably a good person to answer this since I'm a hobbyist who programs for fun and not a professional. \n\nProgramming is a very pure form of creation. When you are engineering in actual materials, there are a lot of things you have to account for in real-world physics that get in the way, like materials, costs, production speed. But in programming, you can get instant results that behave exactly as defined. The only limitations are your own skill and imagination. Even moreso today, now that computers are so powerful that there's no real ceiling to what you can create except your own skill level and how much time you have. \n\nI'm a game developer, so for me any game I am making is an opportunity to imagine how things interact, what properties different things can have. I can take an existing idea and just alter it however I want. It's simultanously freeing, and a little bit scary, since truly there are no limits and that means that committing to any ideas can mean abandoning others. \n\nIt's also a very pure form of problem solving: computers do exactly what you tell them do. EXACTLY. To a fault. That means that if you tell it\n\n     do x until y = 0 \n\nthen it will. And if y never equals 0... then it will just loop that command endlessly. \n\n\nThere are hard parts, absolutely. Really, the whole thing is hard. Until it gets easier, and then suddenly you realize you can do something a bit differently and then... it's hard again. \n\nDon't get discourged, though. We live in a real golden age for programming. \n\nIf I can offer you a bit of advice: never copy paste code from anywhere and don't let AI do any work for you until after you are already mastering programming. Always type it out. That way you spend time really \"touching\" every part of the code, because while there are some things that you might not understand yet and that you can safely ignore for now, all of it (except comments) ultimately matters in the end to how the program runs and its presence or absense can be detrimental.",

The results certainly are though, I really struggle sometimes to imagine how people can live without it.\n\nWhenever I'm curious about something, I can just go solve it. for example recently I've been curious about how good MotoGP riders are when separated from bike performance, so I threw together a web scraper to grab results, implemented a rating system to separate performance and ran it. Excluding the fact I already had libraries written for some of this stuff, it only took an evening and I had a 'good enough' answer to my curiosity.\n\nIf I didn't know how to do this, I don't really know what I could have done to answer that question. Maybe slowly crawling through wikipedia, copying results into excel and then a liberal use of formulas to calculate some kind of simple ratings? It'd have taken ages just to manually extract that data though and is far more effort than it's worth.\n\nI also do a 'picks league' for UFC events with a few friends, with our own points system. Because I know how to, I was able to put together a little web app that presented all our picks, results, breakdowns by event, individual stats and records, and pop it up for everyone to be able to look at. Something like that wouldn't have been possible if I'd never become a developer.\n\nThere's also more practical stuff, whenever there's a particular repetitive task I need to perform, I always have the option to write something to automate it so I can do something else with my time instead. I couldn't tell you how many times I've written quick one-off command line apps to do a job for me.\n\nConsidering how easy it is to learn, and the numerous practical uses, I can't imagine what life would be like without it.",

Something I still remember about when I started coding is the mentality shift; Prior to coding, there were problems in my professional life that just couldn't be fixed (e.g. a journalist doesn't want to cover your story). In the coding space, most anything can be done - it's on you to learn it. A fun challenge :)",
