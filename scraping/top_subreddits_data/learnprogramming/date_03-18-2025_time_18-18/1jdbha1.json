Damn, idk what's wrong with chat gpt in terms of using tailwind I might not do it again. \n\nChatgpt normally works with Laravel and PHP very well though.",

Plenty of models come with interfaces that also give it web search capabilities (which effectively involves *appending* web context to the prompt you give it), and they are increasingly coming with agentic/iterative capabilities that can break problems down into multiple steps.\n\nIf you're asking OpenAI deep research to summarise something, for example, the choice is more like:\n\n>\"Read the instructions\" \n\n> or\n\n>\"Have somebody with a general memory of the instructions also spend ~60 mins researching the topic to update their knowledge, identifying troublesome areas along the way and focusing particularly on those topics, then another ~5 mins synthesising what they've learned based on what your priorities seem to be.\"\n\nI think there are plenty of good reasons to choose the latter, especially since you can always dip into the instructions yourself *after* you get the research back \u2014 and you're likely to orient yourself within those instructions a fair bit faster.\n\nLosing ~1 min to prompt a model and ~5 mins skimming its response before going deeper yourself can be much more efficient than doing all the research yourself, which will very often bring up ~6mins+ of \"wasted\" orientation effort (reading answers or documentation that prove unhelpful in the end, etc).",

But it's also possible that it won't and that reading those SO answers will be a waste of time because they're not close enough to your problem \u2014 if they even have a posted solution.\n\nAnd sure, an AI *might* give you a wrong answer. But it might also give you a very good answer, potentially even one much better than actually exists on the web to scrape. This is especially true if you're not even sure how to frame the problem; you can't exactly google *\"this process is slow, help\"* and get a concrete answer (this is what StackOverflow is for!), whereas AI might give you a few ideas to get started with... without needing to wait and hope for a response.\n\nSo a question like *\"why risk a wrong answer from AI when a Google search might help?\"* is about as solid as the exact opposite, *\"why risk going through useless Google results when an AI might help?\"*. Neither of them are good questions at a high level. You just have to do the actual cost-benefit analysis \u2014 and AI is becoming popular precisely because it very often works out in favour of AI (especially in the context of an early-stage research question like the type we seem to be talking about).",

Maybe I missed this phase because I was already working in this line by the time the LLM revolution started. These are statistical models. They don't know right from wrong. They don't know when they hallucinate, or even if the information that they were supplied (assuming they were augmented in the first place) is valid or not. There's no magical innovation that's ever going to take place such that LLMs will give better responses to questions than the docs someone wrote for some library they carefully crafted for other people to use. Rule-based AI is fundamentally different from statistical AI. This is the same reason you'll never find a serious compiler that runs primarily on machine learning models. I hope you understand what a scary thing it is to copy commands outputted from such a model and not knowing what the command will do until you run it.\u00a0",
