    "selftext": "I have a lot of time learning a new language and or framework. I pretty burnt out in the web and app dev field and also lack ideas what apps or websites i could build. I didn't study cs but worked about 10 years as web and app developer until i burnt out. I feel better now but don't want to make the same mistake again. I don't have to be employable with the new skill but it would be nice, if i could feelance at some point in the future. What are my options? Thank you. ",
