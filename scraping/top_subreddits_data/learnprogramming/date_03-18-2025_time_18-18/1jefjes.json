It is just that the Jetbrains IDEs provide a smoother experience out of the box in my experience. \n\nHowever, there are many more great IDEs, particularly for certain languages or use cases. For example Visual Studio (without the Code) offers a good experience for C++ or C# Windows dev and .NET and Spyder might be a good choice for Python data science stuff. I also know some people who simply use (Neo)Vim or even emacs and use separate tools for everything else.",

Visual Studio still has most of the professional game development and dotnet community. I don't think JetBrains strength is competing against existing tools, rather I think they excel in providing tools for ecosystems that don't really have them. Take Python for example. JB makes an IDE exclusively for Python (granted, it's just IntelliJ in the background), which to my knowledge, is one of the only IDEs dedicated to Python. They've done similar things with Rust and web development. Providing professional grade tools to all areas of development is their specialty.",
