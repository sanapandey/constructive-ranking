    "selftext": "My son and I picked up the game yesterday and starting playing. We both set out quality settings to max, but his PC was lagging a lot due to frame rate drops. So he moved it down and it seems \"OK\" but the fidelity of the game is fairly lacking. So I was curious if there are certain settings that can be dropped to boost FPS that aren't very noticeable when deactivated.\n\nThanks!",

But if shadows meant going from 50fps to 40fps, I would take the extra 10fps for sure. I'm also considering going all in on a proper high end build so maybe I don't have to sacrifice anything one day (except my wallet)",
