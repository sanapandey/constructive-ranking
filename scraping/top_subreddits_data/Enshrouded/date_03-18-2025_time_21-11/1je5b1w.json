    "selftext": "Think about 2 days ago someone posted how they just figured out how to add things to factories from the magic chest with the buttons inside and I'm upset because of how much I played running stuff around and finding stuff without knowing that was there. \n\nThis also reminded me of when I first started playing I didn't realize you could change who you were summing with a summoning staff the way the freed villager stayed as an image of the staff I thought it bounded to them and I had a staff for every single villager and I kept all the stuff I needed for each village I needed anytime I was doing anything with them..... \n\nWhat are some of the other stupid simple things people didn't realize and then figured out later in the game?",

An example for point b) - you find Ice-Coated Daggers that deal 49 damage. It will show the range of possible damage next to it like this: 49 damage \\[47-50 dmg\\]. This would let you know that you found a near BiS roll of that weapon to decide if you want to farm chests further or if you are satisfied being close to BiS.",
