There's good and bad with that. The bad being, it'll never feel like a unique landscape. The good being, the world in this game is really, really big and very detailed. Your building options are much more expansive and there's a much more straight forward way to fast travel around the world.\n\nThere's a more gamified RPG progression system, and while you can go wherever you want, it's a little more guided in where you can go (based on enemy level, what you have unlocked, etc). \n\nI would say, it never has the same kind of open world exploration feeling you will get in Valheim, but you will get a very cool world to explore.",

They can be pretty similar games or vastly different, depending on what you are looking for.\n\nValheim wins in terms of pure exploration.  I'm reaching endgame on my first Enshrouded run, and I can already tell next one won't go nearly as long, on account of knowing where everything is.  I love and respect the developers' preference for a single, well-curated world, but gamers who enjoy discovering new things are going to get way more out of subsequent replays of Valheim than Enshouded.\n\nI love the diversity of building materials in Enshouded.  7 Days to Die taught me to love voxel base-building, and Enshouded literally doubles the detail in its own way (0.5m vs. 1.0m blocks).  That being said, I wish you could do more with those blocks than just make...  blocks (7 Days to Die lets you make a variety of shapes out of building materials, like angles and arches and pipes and such, not just tiny cubes).  I actually kind of like Valheim's building system more, simply in terms of customizing your environment, and I do enjoy some semblance of structural integrity.  I just wish Valheim's coolest construction materials weren't gated behind half a dozen bosses and remarkably difficult content.\n\nValheim is...  brutal, at times.  By the time I'd mastered that game, I would go back and play other survival craft games and just run in with my Lv 1 stone axe like I owned the place.  I'm not a big fan of base raids or losing all my stuff every time I die (I hate dying in games, so it's not a mechanic I'm abusing anytime soon).  Enshrouded has no base raids, and you can turn off drop-items-on-death completely (even Valheim has you losing experience and backpack items upon death, bare minimum).\n\nI have very few complaints about Enshrouded.  I'll probably put another twenty or thirty hours in, post-final boss, and come back when they release 1.0.  I'll also be there in Valheim when 1.0 comes out.",

You can tell no thought is put into melee, even the final boss is a timed DPS check that is only in melee range for 5% of the time.\n\nIf you like playing bow or magic then the game is a cake walk as long as you prep.\n\nValheim requires more skill easily. I have several thousand hours and can go into biomes above me and survive just fine due to timing and reacting around enemy move sets. Enshrouded is more of an MMO where either you have the gear and stats to win or you don't.\n\nBuilding is more rewarding though because you fill your base with NPCs.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a great building game with combat slapped on as an after thought. If you're looking for more combat oriented survival, I'd say Outward is objectively better it's just not as flashy",

You aren't gonna be building your own equipment as much as finding it and upgrading it. \n\nProgression is much more standard RPG with an extensive skill tree that give you more class differentiation rather than gear differentiation. \n\nFood, rest, and comfort is basically the same as Valheim. Get better food, get better housing, get bigger bonuses\n\nCombat and exploration is much MUCH more mobile. You'll be dodging and sprinting more than blocking, and it feels faster and more bouncy than Valheim.\n\nExploration is driven by quests more than player driven. Most new discoveries will be guided to via a quest, but the player still sets the pace. More variety of dungeon challenges\n\nGrapple, double jump, wing suit, and being able to terraform everything means there's a high degree of player freedom of movement.",

I will say there is a learning curve for the build system, and it feels a bit awkward and unintuitive.(He says after nearly rage quitting while trying to build a roof one teeny-tiny brick at a time. After i logged out, watched a roof tutorial video and cooled my head, i realized i didn't scroll far enough in the build menu to find the roof tiles). That said, it gives you a lot more building blocks, and decorations to work with,(if you can find them in the menu) right at the start, than most of the other survival/crafting games ive played, including valheim. What i don't  like so far, is in order to place furnishings, they go into your inventory, then/or a quick slot in order to place them. Seems like an unnecessary extra step, unless i am missing a short cut somewhere. I can't speak about the combat in enshrouded yet as I've only fought a couple wolves, goats, and rabbity-lookin things. Once i got past what was obviously user error, i like what i am seeing so far. \nThe only other thing that bugs me a bit, is the fact that the inventory is finicky. If you don't have something lined up over the slot just right, it doesn't take. At first i thought there was some kind of restriction on what you can and can't put into inventory/chests.",
