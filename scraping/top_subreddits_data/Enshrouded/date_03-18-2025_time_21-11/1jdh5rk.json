Are there ways to optimize fun. Im looking to take it slow and explore the game at my own pace. Is this game still good solo? Ive tried a few survival games that only feel fun with friends so i just thought id ask before I buy.",

I find similar games usually don't keep me interested solo but with this game having a good number of npcs to add to your base it helps. Depending on what difficulty you want you can have a nice relaxed game or something more hard core.",

            "body": "I play solo and with a friend. Both are great. \nIf you like building, crafting, and/or exploration I absolutely recommend. If you decide  you are lonely you could go join someone else\u2019s server any time you want, and you can transfer whatever character/items you want, it\u2019s super easy and fast.\n\nI\u2019ve played a few building/survival games (Minecraft, Ark, rust, 7 days to die, Valheim, Terrerria  etc) and enshrouded has my favorite building system so far. It\u2019s also the prettiest and has the coolest armor out of all the ones I\u2019ve tried. Also more fun PVE content and a really solid crafting system. I like its combat the best out of all the ones I\u2019ve tried as well. \n\nThe community managers and devs are also top notch for this game. They are by far the best I\u2019ve ever come across in any game. They are excellent at listening to player feedback, they even set up website for player to give ideas and upvote what they want brought game. They have already brought a lot of stuff people voted for.\n\nFurthermore, I think one of the top indicators of how good a game will \u201cage\u201d  is the devs and community managers. I\u2019ve seen so many games start out strong and/or with so much potential, but the \u201cdirector\u201d (or whoever\u2019s in charge of major decisions) just absolutely butchers it. They don\u2019t listen to feedback and in many cases don\u2019t even have a lot of gaming experience themselves and implant so truely terrible ideas, often for the wrong reasons.  They make the game worse and worse with every update or do the bare minimum, without a care in the world I swear. \n\nThis game I can tell the developers really love what they are making, know what they are doing, and care about feedback and that alone excites me. The game is already solid and it has a solid team behind it who listens to feedback so it\u2019s just going to keep getting better every update. I\u2019m so excited!",

            "body": "Solo experience is great. I have two characters one solo and one I play with a buddy when he has time. This goes for all ways to play, but especially solo. Play on a custom difficulty do not use a pre-set. The sliders are pretty self explanatory, but I will share what changes I made. I think resources are a bit annoying considering the volume of some stuff you need, so I increased mining damage to 200% since all it does is give more ore on hit and cut down trees faster. I also turned plant growth and workshop production to 200% as well. If you dont play melee youll need TONs of resources to upkeep arrows/spells (yes spells are ammo you have to craft). Runes can be hard to come by if you dont chest farm by opening and closing the word and running a chest route to max runes so I just turn up runes I get from salvaging my old weapons to about 80% default is 50% return on investment. I would say to always turn these settings on even with double resource and crafting speed I still think its too slow.\n\nMore optional things that I just like. I turned off weapon durability and starvation. I felt weapon durability only really gimped my exploration constantly having to keep coming back to my base and deal with inv management. Starving was removed bc some workstations are just really slow and I would just afk in base waiting for my stuff to craft so I had to turn that off to avoid dying. Boss health to 200% enemy health 150% enemy amount set to more. I like combat which is probably why I need more resources to keep up on ammo bc of the additional enemies and their increased health. I set day to last 1h. They did a lighting patch and dark places in this game are very dark so you almost cant see anything and you cant hold a torch and your weapons, so while it doesnt stop exploration it does make engaging in combat harder. I sleep the night away and do most things during the day.",

Should i decide before playing or start a veraatile build and decide later? Is respeccing easy or should i decide ahead of time is what im asking.",

Its up to you tho to figure out whats more beneficial then others or if its even worth it to multiclass. Atm there are a lot of \"noob trap\" nodes, but hopefully they get worked out sometime this year. Biggest thing I think I could tell ya is just like any other game the boring QoL passive/on use abilities on the tree are the most powerful. Having a double jump and an updraft for your glider are two of the most important abilities to get in the tree even if you arent playing the classes associated with those perks. also DONT ignore red glowing books/paper they put points of interest on your map.",

                            "body": "Respecing is easy. You respec by using runes, which you get from salvaging weapons/armor that you find. If you turn up the setting that gives you more runes for salvaging, respecting is easy as pie. Even if you don\u2019t turn that setting up respecting is pretty cheap. You have the option to respect everything for a price or respect individual skills for even less runes. \n\nAs for builds, right now the \u201cbest\u201d builds are the ones where you focus into either melee, range, or magic trees, but you don\u2019t have to. I am currently running a paladin build that is a mix of melee and magic trees with a dash from one of the stamina/range tree\u2019s and it\u2019s been doing great so far, haven\u2019t tested it in hollow halls yet tho. You can put your skills into whatever trees you want, very similar to Skyrim imo, except there is a little more overlap between the trees so it\u2019s easier to get to the end of some trees without having to start from the beginning of that tree. \n\nI think you should just toy around with the skills that interest you. If you have trouble there\u2019s plenty of good builds on YouTube and it\u2019s super easy to respec. Def get double jump tho, it\u2019s extremely helpful for navigating terrain which you will be doing a lot.",

Always had a friend build while i practiced combat and grinded enemy loot. This game actually feels pretty polished for building and so i was wondering if i should give it a few hours of building and see if i can stick with it. My only worry is that the base will become obsolete location wise and if its a waste of my altar slots. Do i get a ton of them or should i play for awhile before finding a perfect spot, maintaining a functional spot until then?",

So I would try to find a place you like for your final project and just add to it not knock it out completely because you will find different blocks and furniture you may want to add. The base building is fun because you can do so much with it and you can balance you combat and exploration when you don\u2019t want to build. I like the game because I\u2019m a night shift nurse and when I get up if the weather sucks or I have some time I want to kill I hop on and just grind out those things I said above. It feels like a game that has a lot of polish already just knowing they are continuously adding new areas is the cherry on top. I bought my PC because I was so psyched to play Manor Lords and Silent Hill 2 when they came out and I haven\u2019t played them at all since finding this game.

Also some reflections on build choice.\n\n* Turn off weapon durability. Has weapon durability ever been a positive thing in any game ever? I despise it.\n\n* Machine crafting speed to 200%. Still feels a little slow but much better.\n\n* Food buff duration to max. Makes me less likely to horde food as it actually lasts awhile.\n\n* Loot quantity x2. Makes farming for things like building and crafting materials bearable. I built a decent sized base and crafted everything needed. It's honestly not a bad grind.\n\n* I started as a mage, tried ranger, and eventually settled on a warrior/barbarian. The mob density at some points in the game, particularly the hollow halls, is clearly designed around multiplayer. I found that melee with life leech enabled me to actually enjoy the dungeons as you get completely swarmed otherwide if you play at the dungeon level.",
