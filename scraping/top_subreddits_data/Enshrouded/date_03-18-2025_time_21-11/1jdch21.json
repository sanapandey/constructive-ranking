The game is fantastic.\n\nHowever, do you always return to your base no matter where you log out? I logged out randomly in a location as I was coming off for the night and I was back at my base the next day. That is my only minor annoyance so far. I am guessing this is how it will be all the time going forward? \n\nSo if I am out and about it's best to do what I want to do before closing the game.\n\n",

I heard the 2nd one about to go boom but just realised a second too late then DEATH haha. I continued into the shroud and then got surrounded by a few enemies and trapped in a doorway and rolled out the way to ultimate no stamina left then DEATH...ha! \n\nThe enemies hit like damn trucks man! I can see this game is going to eat my time and I definitely need to learn to get good. Ranged is easy ish but that feels like cheesing the game a bit, going melee is fun but I have to be careful! Early days and not spend any skill points yet as I want to play about with some weapons first. \n\nAre you able to respec later and if so is it expensive to keep doing?",
