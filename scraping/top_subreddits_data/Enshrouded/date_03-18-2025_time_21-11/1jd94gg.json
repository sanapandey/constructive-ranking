In the way that there is massive lag, especially when the people are at different locations far apart on the map. It results often in loading times for people when they teleport, with waiting times over 1 minute.\nIn the server log you can then see lots of entries about packages being in queue towards the various clients.\nFrom my perspective it looks to me whatever engine is used, it performs very badly in regards of online multiplayer, in the way it can\u2019t keep up the synchronization.",
