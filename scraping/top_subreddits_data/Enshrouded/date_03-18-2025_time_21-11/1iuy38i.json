Bonus points if the movement upgrades are key unlocks through the world (maybe new dungeon rewards?).\n\nCombat- gear is in such an iffy place for me. Especially weapons... finding rng weapons in chest just doesn't work (especially with spam reloading being a thing) and the power balance is all over the place. My lvl 25 legendary ice sword still peak 1H weapon, with good dmg and 15% more crit chance \u2764\ufe0f\n\nFast travel locations- this one got to me a bit more than I expected. There is some large areas of the map that are just super duper far from the flame towers. By design? Can plop down flame altars sure, but I think 3 or 4 more towers in ideal locations would go a long way with making current tower coverage in a more fair spot.\n\n\nHuge fan of dungeons too, so always will welcome more especially if we can get some more complex puzzles a-la zelda-style.\n\nKeep up the great work \ud83d\ude01\nCan't wait to see what comes next!",
