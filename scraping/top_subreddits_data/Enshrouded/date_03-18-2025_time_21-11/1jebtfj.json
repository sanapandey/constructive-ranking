    "selftext": "This is my spouse and I's base from the playthrough we just completed. I'm the builder of the two of us and spent almost as much time on this base as we did progressing the game (not a complaint!). My prime rule for a base in any video game is that it must first be user friendly. No giant towers and running long distances to get from one end to the other. So welcome to Pillar's heart, a three level cliffside village in the Nomad Highlands. We're happy to sacrifice a bit of function for form (no giant box with everyone stacked in place), but this let us quickly get whatever we needed and still enjoy some pretty great views of the area.",

The npcs had crafting stations and beds, nothing else!\n\nAs time went on I added bits and pieces. Shelves here, books and flowers there, it slowly filled in. All the pretty decorative elements came over time.",
