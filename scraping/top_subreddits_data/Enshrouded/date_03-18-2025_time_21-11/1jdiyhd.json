    "selftext": "No one thinks stacks have no sense ?\nOk inventory stacks, but chest ones ? \nI think they should be equal or at least based on size and the smaller should be 100...\n\nExamples\nWood stacks at 250, wood planks at 50, why ? Just to annoy the player? Wood planks are 1/1 wood, less wood quantity, less weight (cause when you make a plank you have residual wood), more stackable being flat, but hey make their stack smaller...\n\nRugged clothes? Some light clothes much less stackable than wood...\nAnd shall we talk of salt? Something almost at powder state...\n\nI think they made random stack just to fill tons of containers.\nOk low limits in inventory (some stacks at 20 are still too limited), but in containers I don't get why I must have 5 stacks of salt for 250 salt and 1 of wood for 250 of wood... Ok let's avoid sizelogic, stack them all at 100 \ud83d\ude06",

That way, I could come  back from an adventure, run up and down the road briefly and dump my goods.\n\nExcept, looking down the road, I could see all these teal glowing boxes, interrrupting the ambiance of the town.
