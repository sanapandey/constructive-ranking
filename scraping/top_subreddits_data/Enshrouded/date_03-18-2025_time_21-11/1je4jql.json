    "selftext": "So I'm doing a quest where you fight a guy named Fell Sicklescythe. I have the ability to grab flying bad guys out of the air and bring them to me, or if it's a BIG monster I go to them. \n\nWell, I didn't think this Sickle guy was big so I used that ability and instead of him coming to me I got pulled 30 feet in the air and I drop taking a ton of damage. \n\nHow do I beat this guy strictly melee? I can't reach him. \n\nI use 2 handed weapons and 1 handed and a shield. \n\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\nEDIT: I got him! Thanks for all the help/advice. When I parried his scythes, only one ever bounced off and it went straight ahead. I was hoping it would seek him out. \n\nHe finally came down to a level I could hit him after dodging a bunch of his attacks instead of trying to block everything. When I got close I did a ton of damage and he barley hit me with his scythes. He didn't have time to cast his explode-a-skull. ",
