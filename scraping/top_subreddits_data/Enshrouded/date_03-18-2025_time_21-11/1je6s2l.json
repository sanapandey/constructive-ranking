    "selftext": "Morning all,\n\nI have a rented dedicated server for enshrouded that I am not presently playing on personally so my info on the issue is second hand. \n\nApparently, when someone logs out with full gear, they return to game missing gear. I believe they only lose the gear they would drop if dead but I should get confirmation. This has now happened 3 or 4 times which is super frustrating.\n\nAnyone familiar with this issue and have a fix? Are logout possibly not working and then the player is starving while they think they are logged out?\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nRei\n",
