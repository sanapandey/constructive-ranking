    "selftext": "Hi Guys\n\nPicking the game up again after a 6 month or so break. Last time I played, Hollow Halls weren't really playable at the level of the mobs due to the spawn rates (and the potentially broken spawns in the later rooms etc), and the main way to beat them was to cheese or just outlevel them.\n\nCan't find any info, so just wondering if they've had a balance pass or any bugfixes in the last 6 months or so?\n\nCheers",
