    "selftext": "I'm a graduate of the University of Toronto doing something completely unrelated to tech at the moment (Asset Management). A combination of hating my career but now having a substantial enough nest egg built up has me considering switching careers.\n\nI know U of T has a renowned CS department, but from what research I've done applying to it if you're not admitted directly to the CS faculty is incredibly hard. One of the numbers I've read was a minimum average of 90% to be accepted. If you know U of T you know how next to impossible it is to do that well.\n\nAs a result I've been considering other options, but I'm nervous about how limiting they'd be for my career. Does anyone know how limiting York would be?",

But it helps a lot to have a strong university name backing you. This will make life harder for you but it\u2019s not impossible. Good luck!",
