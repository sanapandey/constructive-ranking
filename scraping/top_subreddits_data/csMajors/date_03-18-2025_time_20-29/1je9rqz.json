AI has no perception of effort or hassle though there are output size limits.  \n\nThen humans and other AI did more training where they voted up outputs where the ai made a full answer and tried in response to a question, and downvote less helpful answers.\n\nSo the model is more likely to help.  Usually.  Sometimes it tells you to do it yourself.",
