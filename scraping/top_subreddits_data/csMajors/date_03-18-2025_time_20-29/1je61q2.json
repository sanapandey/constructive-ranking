Those are definitely ripe for fancy auto-complete to take over and I'd gladly let it, but building interesting things, solving user problems , and yes, doing so with well crafted and thoughtful code is neither mundane nor repetitive. And it's definitely not something LLMs can do well. \n\nPeople wailing and gnashing teeth over the future of the tech industry with LLMs either don't understand the profession, don't understand LLMs, or have completely bought into the hype of people who have invested too much money into something that yes, is really really cool for some use cases, but at the end of the day is not nearly as revolutionary as they want it to be.",

Most of the use in development requires heavy oversight and correction from a developer.\n\nAt the moment it's useful for generating templates to work from. It's not good at large, interconnected logic because its basically a multidimensional markov chain. It's just taking data from other programmers and extrapolating.\n\nThat means we would need a completely new model / paradigm to feasibly replace anyone. Its fundamentally incapable of designing those systems, it is just matching your words to code.\n\nProtip: If the company selling shovels in the gold rush (like NVIDIA) tells you that you should buy shovels, you should probably be skeptical and challenge their assumptions.",
