    "selftext": "I worked my ass off for 7 months, grinding leetcode doing projects and interview prep \u2014 rejection after rejection. It seemed that I hit a new low every week. And now I got my dream role in a challenging economic environment and im so grateful. \n\nObviously I\u2019d love to share the news with my network and let my circle of supporters and professional contacts know about my new milestone and share the same thrill as me. But when I was unemployed I remember hating on these types of posts and even the people who posted it. Linkedin obviously is to blame for promoting fake jobs and spreading so much toxic content of cringey self-congratulating posts. But I genuinely want to let my network know what I\u2019m up to and maybe even build my technical brand. I don\u2019t want to ruin someone\u2019s day when they see my post or make them feel low \u2014 because I\u2019ve been there so many times. \n\nWould it be better if I shared resources (cold-email templates, strategies, leetcode notes) in my post? Would that give off elitist vibes? Or should I just not make the post altogether? Ultimately I\u2019d like to build my brand so recruiters can find me easily and I can even find cool people online to build projects. \n\nthank you so much for your time reading all of this. i know people have much bigger problems than mine that need discussion \u2014 this is clearly a very good problem to have and I\u2019d appreciate your 2 cents.",
