    "selftext": "I have two internship offers, one that is more of the typical business operation focused IT work with web dev and some backend stuff. The second offer pays significantly better but is in embedded systems using C++/Linux etc. I\u2019m taking computer architecture rn and don\u2019t really enjoy it, and I want to go into business focused roles in the future such as project management. Is it worth it to do the embedded internship? Is there scope for it? I rarely hear anyone in these roles. Thank you for any advice",
