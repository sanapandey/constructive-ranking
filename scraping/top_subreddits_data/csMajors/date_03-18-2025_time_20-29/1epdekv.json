This would give you more space to strengthen other sections. As for the honors and awards section, I\u2019m not sure how valuable it is, but I\u2019ll leave that up to you.\n\nYour projects are solid for where you are in your college career. However, I think you\u2019re bolding too much. I\u2019d recommend removing bold formatting entirely and focusing on smaller bullet points that are more direct. Highlight the impact of your work and what you achieved, rather than just listing what you did. For example, your last project needs to be broken up into smaller, more digestible points.\n\nYour leadership experience and activities section can likely be removed. While it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s not relevant to software engineering, so it won\u2019t add much value here. Removing it should give you enough space to add another experience or enhance your existing ones.\n\nLastly, I\u2019d suggest focusing on full-stack projects or adding something with more front-end work. That aspect seems to be missing from your resume right now. I have a bunch more improvements in mind, but those should be good to get you started.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need your resume reviewed in detail or have questions on anything about the whole process.

Also you have a good GPA, but I don't think that should take up an entire line; you can probably condense your Education section a tad. What is \"Experiential Learning Experiences\"? I think you can just put \"Work Experience\" or \"Projects\" and split things up that way.

So this resume needs to optimize for 1) skimmability and 2) intelligibility to a non-technical person.\n\nquick impressions: \n\n* Ditch the objective. Adds nothing \n* The format of this resume requires effort from the reader to extract the main points. Not good for skimmability. Make the important info easier to find. Let me know if you want some templates. \n* For education, stick to essential information. Ditch \u201cMagna Cum Laude\u201d and \u201cDean\u2019s List: All semesters.\u201d Also scrap the parentheticals beside some of the courses. \n* Under skills, I would have two sections, \u201cLanguages\u201d and \u201cTechnologies.\u201d Don\u2019t list your soft skills, those should shine through in your bullet points. Within each of those sections, alphabetize the list items\n* Work Experience needs to come next after skills. \n* I\u2019d bet this WE section is your biggest blessing and your biggest curse. You have an impressive amount of experience. However, this section is starving for impact. You simply must rack your brain for business impact. Numbers, percentages, dollars and cents. If you can\u2019t think of any, email your old managers from your internships and ask for them. \n* Also, in the places where you do have numbers \u2014 \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d \u201cmillions of records\u201d \u2014 the figures just blend in because they\u2019re written in text. If you want to approximate within an order of magnitude, you can say $X,000,00 for \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d or \u201cX,000,000\u201d records. \n* As a quick example of how *you* can figure out the impact, let\u2019s take the example of \u201cmanaging millions of records to free up space.\u201d Did you free up space for millions of records? What kind of records were they? If they were pdfs of health insurance claims, then let\u2019s say the average record is 1mb. Let\u2019s then say you freed up 5,000,000 records. That is 5TB of freed storage. Figure out how much it would have cost to store 5TB in a HIPAA-compliant manner over the next five years. Now, instead of saying \u201cmanaging millions of records to free up space,\u201d you can say \u201cEngineered a C# database archival engine to optimize record storage, reducing costs by $X,000 for the next five years.\u201d See the difference? \n\nThis resume is a start. There's even more to dig into besides the above, but I'll leave you with this for now. Let me know if you have questions.",

You will not be hired or fired based on your resume. It\u2019s only job is to move you to forward in the hiring process, and on average, the recruiter who reads it will spend ~7 seconds on it. So this resume needs to optimize for 1) skimmability and 2) intelligibility to a non-technical person. \n\nWith that in mind, quick impressions:\n\n* In general, the format isn\u2019t consistent with general resume best practices, which hurts you on point 1 from above. Sticking to a cookie cutter format actually *helps* you, because the recruiter will know where to look to find crucial info. Are you familiar with LaTeX? \n* In general, dial back the bolding. Only bold section headers and bullet point group titles. \n* All dates should be written as \u201cmonthName yearNumeral\u201d as in September 2019 or June 2023\n* Format your education from most to least recent, so Master\u2019s degree on top. \n* Move technical skills up; it should go right after education.\n* Retitle \u201cAdditional Tools\u201d to something like \u201cFrameworks and Technologies\u201d\n* For your jobs, the bolded \u201ctitle section\u201d of each group of bullets should be the name of the company, not the name of your role. It looks like the company is what\u2019s blacked out. If so, just switch their places so the company name comes first. \n* For your Full-Stack Developer role, you have good quantifiable impact, but it\u2019s buried in text. You need to hit the impact metrics as soon as possible. It\u2019s also too long. I would do something closer to: \u201cDeveloped an AI-powered Python system to automate data and metadata extraction from images, accelerating document creation time by 50%\u201d \n* My instinct is that the above could be even better if I had more context about your role. What kinds of images? What are they being used for (user account creation, client onboarding, etc.)? Also, if NLP and OCR are directly related to the job posting, make space to include them. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think they add a lot over just saying \u201cAI\u201d\n* For Section 1 Bullet 2 (s1b2), ditch all references to the technologies you used. Moving the \u201cTechnical Skills\u201d section up will keep you from having to mention them in the bullets.\n* With that in mind, you can shorten it to \u201cEngineered a full-stack application to manage clients, [verb] job proposals, and generate price quotes, improving quoting efficiency by 25%\u201d \n* Re: the above, I\u2019m not sure what \u201cquoting efficiency\u201d means. Is that a decrease in the amount of time to issue a quote? Whatever it is, just make it clear. \n* Also, as a meta-point, sometimes percentages sound more impressive, sometimes raw values do. Experiment with both and see which sounds more impressive to your ear. Generally, smaller comparisons (<50% change) sound better as percentages, and bigger comparisons sound better with raw values.\n* For s1b3, same as above, ditch technologies. Can you say something like \u201cBuilt a data analytics workflow\u201d or similar, it sounds like that\u2019s what you did and if so, that sounds better. \n* \u201cEvaluate machine efficiency.\u201d For every bullet, you need to be asking *why*. Did that machine efficiency help the company allocate budget? Did it it lead to reduced resource consumption? If you can tie what you did to impact, you\u2019re golden. \n\nI'll leave you with that for now. Let me know how all of this sits with you, and if you'd like my thoughts on the remaining sections.",

It's extremely helpful to get the information - everyone else has more or less told me they didn't have any feedback for me. I'd love to get your thoughts on the remaining sections; I'll be working on my resume today using the advice you've currently given me.\n\nThe images were pdf documents that had a mixture of images (images of products) with text, they were being used for digesting the information in client documents to business documents/forms in the manufacturing workflow- I'm not sure exactly where this falls categorically, maybe client order processing?\n\nYes, it's the time to issue a quote. I'll change that wording to make it more clear.\n\nThe raw numbers didn't seem that impressive to be honest, so I think I should probably keep the percentages? The 50% change was a 30 minute ->  \\~10 minute generation.   \n\nThat's a great idea, I'll change it to building a data analytics workflow. Measuring the efficiency helped influence the decision to purchase a new machine, but I'm not really sure how to word that in the resume. \n\nI also built another data workflow for supplier prices, which led the company to change suppliers for a specific type of material, but I'm not sure if putting that in would make it too wordy. \n\n  \nThank you SO much again and I hope to hear from you again soon!",

                    "body": "You've got impressive experience. I think when making this resume, you just had your priorities wrong as far as what to emphasize. \n\n\nnotes:\n\n* Education\n    * should be at the top.\n    * List your GPA if it\u2019s not awful\n* Skills\n    * Just separate each example with a comma.\n* Experience\n* As an overarching point, many people approach the resume as a change to show what *they* did, which is super understandable. But the purpose of a resume, in fact, is to show what *your work* did. It doesn\u2019t really matter that you \u201cLeveraged LinkedIn courses.\u201d A hiring manager is much more interested in the impact that your container orchestration had on the business. There\u2019s all kinds of ways to quantify this impact, using different measurable and different degrees of granularity. But that\u2019s what\u2019s largely missing here. It\u2019s not what *you* did; it\u2019s what *your work* did. \n* Also, your skills section is where you namedrop all the cool tech you can use. Mentioning it in every bullet point is overkill, and bolding it distracts from the point (at best) and gives the impression that you think the paintbrush is the most important part of painting Starry Night (at worst). \n* First (on the page) internship\n    * First bullet point is impressive, but the bolding of the technologies distracts from the impressive part, which is what the code actually does. I would condense this, cut the bolding, and mention \u201cwithin 8 minutes\u201d earlier in the sentence. \n* Second (on the page) internship\n    * Don\u2019t underline monitoring tool\n    * As an example of the criticism I keep harping on, when I look at this first bullet, what you\u2019ve drawn attention to is that you built a monitoring tool in Cue and Node. That\u2019s fine and dandy, but you\u2019ve completely buried the (impressive) lede that this reduced manual verification of content accuracy by 95%. That\u2019s the important part. That\u2019s the thing to mention early and to call attention to. \n    * As a side note, when scanning a document from top to bottom (as a recruiter will do when reading this), your eyes tend to focus in the middle of the page. So you don\u2019t want bullet points that stretch from left to right. Make the text wrap somewhere in the middle. \n    * Also, I\u2019d reword \u201creducing manual verification of content accuracy\u201d because when reading quickly, it reads like \u201creducing content accuracy\u201d. \n    * Second bullet is cool re: reduction of manual build time. However, it\u2019s not really clear to me what you did to achieve that. \u201cdeveloping 20+ user-drive programs\u201d is not very clear. This bullet is also too long. \n    * \u201cOptimized branding\u201d is a strange verb+object pair. Rack your brain: what did this actually do? Measurably? \n    * \u201ccollaborative, cross-functional team\u201d just feels like you googled \u201ctech resume buzzwords\u201d and slapped it on the resume. Which would be understandable in this economy, but you shouldn\u2019t make it that obvious. \n* Third internship\n    * I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but I have reviewed many internship+new grade resumes for a large tech company and if I saw someone bold \u201cRESTful API\u201d it would make me roll my eyes. I say this to help you: nobody cares that it was a rest api. If it\u2019s a keyword on the job listing, list in the skills section by all means. But reserve these bullet points for impact. \n    * Second bullet is super intriguing, any word on the impact that you\u2019re offloading these logs had? \n* Fourth internship\n    * first stat about reducing audit time is awesome\n    * 10 new security controls is good, any data on how that reduced breaches, caught bugs early, etc?\n    * Same advice applies to third bullet\n* Projects\n    * Can you list the second one first? It\u2019s more impressive imo. \n    * Also potential type, should it say \u201cclose to 95%\u201d instead of \u201cclose 95%\u201d. \n    * Also just say \u201capproximately 95%\u201d or \u201c~95%\u201d, no need to mention confidence intervals.",

                    "body": "been there re: no one to help with this kind of stuff. Here are my thoughts\n\nnotes:\n\n* as an overall comment, you *need* a skills section. It has a header, just like Education and Experience, and underneath it are two bolded labels. **Languages** and **Frameworks and Technologies**. There, you list the ones you know from each bucket. You can tailor this to the job listing you apply for (make sure to list React for a React job, vs. Angular for an Angular job). \n* Education\n    * I would reformat Education pretty comprehensively. Leave the \u201cEducation\u201d heading where it is. Then do \u201cBachelor\u2019s in Computer Science\u201d on the *next* line. Leave the dates where they are, also no need to italicize and bold them. \n    * List your GPA unless it\u2019s terrible. \n    * List some \u201cRelevant Courses\u201d and just mention the CS and CS-adjacent classes you\u2019ve taken. \n    * Then after that list \u201cHonors\u201d and mention your President\u2019s Scholarship (which is sick by the way).\n    * Ditch the sports bullet point and all high school info. And everything I just mentioned for the education section isn\u2019t meant to be bulleted. It can be flush left like normal test. \n* Experience\n    * Now this is where you *do* need bullet points. \n    * Also, make the text wrap (go onto the next line) somewhere about 3/4 of the way across the line. You don\u2019t want the line stretching all the way across the page so that it\u2019s under the dates. \n    * Ideally each experience entry would have at least two bullets. \n    * Love the hard data on your Software Development Internship. Can you look up/approximate how much the people who would otherwise be doing the data processing get paid? Bc then you can translate hours per week into dollars. Which is the gold standard for showing impact\n    * \u201caccuracy rate of 82% in sentiment analysis\u201d is a little wishy washy. Talk more about *why* you were doing this work, what end purpose did it serve. \n    * For Computer Science Mentor, this rocks. And this is one that could just be a single bullet. To be clear, was this 80% of the students *you* mentored. If so that is awesome, and you should make it clear that they were your mentees. Even better if you can compare your 80% rate of 5\u2019s vs. the program average of 60%, or something like that. \n* Projects\n    * same advice as the software engineer internship applies to this renovation.ai thing\n    * second bullet point under Renovation is poorly conjugated for a resume. Should start with a past tense verb.\n    * Third bullet rocks. Did this get put into use anywhere/in an industry setting? Mention if so, and measure if possible.\n    * I wouldn\u2019t list your personal website. It\u2019s less impressive than the other two projects and just kind of lets air out of the balloon. It\u2019s linked above, they can find it if interested. \n    * Schedule Builder is sick experience. \n* Leadership\n    * No real notes for now. \"Enhance task efficiency\" is kind of strange wording. Do you just mean made it faster?",

It's not that any one part of it is indefensible, but rather that its format is so far off the beaten path that it makes it seem like you didn't do your homework on what a resume is supposed to look like. Take a look at the other resumes in this thread and look at what people do; most of them are on the right track. To get you started, you want to keep it to one page with sections for \"Education\" \"Skills\" \"Experience\" \"Projects\" and \"Leadership and Extracurriculars\". No colored fonts, just black. There's really nothing that should be centered on the page. On the left hand side of the page you'll have the names of places you attended school/worked, and on the right hand side you'll have the dates you worked there and perhaps the location where it was.  \n\nThese things are all Google-able too.

You also don't need the publications section since you can just link to it right after your project title with the same work (the way you have it now sort of separates it which is confusing). A lot of your experience section reads like ChatGPT and I feel like some time can go into editing for clarity and only including each bullet point if it conveys something new. \n\nI have a few more improvements in my mind, but we can chat over DMs for that if you want.

I think it is important to have those languages there as it shows your experience with it rather than being just a keyword. In your Projects section you are just listing NLP and ML. I think you can also put the languages there too. I think you can benefit from a template too because it was a little hard for me to read: [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs)\n\nHope this helps! I can think of a few more things that may help you in this process, but we can DM for that if you want. Good luck!",

I\u2019ve worked on several full-stack projects (e.g., Zoom clone, Stack Overflow clone) and contributed to open-source projects. Any advice on how to highlight my skills and projects, or general suggestions to make my resume stronger, would be hugely appreciated.

I recommend this one to my students: [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs)\n\nThere is no reason for an awards section, but if it is a really well known and important thing it can be fit into another section like skills or even you education depending on what it is and if you really want to include it. Your bullet points shouldn't have more than one sentence. I see you have lots of explanations and detail which is good, but I think you can break into smaller bullet points and also rewrite with strong action verbs + impact on the company/project/school.

Sort of confused what is going on in your education section with two different dates, but I am going to assume what you have there is necessary (if they aren't absolutely necessary feel free to remove or condense). You shouldn't be just listing out your skills at the end of each experience. You can either weave them into your bullet points or user a pipe character like you did for Projects if you really want to (I would recommend making it seamless and not spamming). You can always put everything in your bottom section. \n\nI have a some more improvements in mind, but those should be good to get you started. If you have any more questions feel free to DM me.

You have pretty good projects, I think you can seriously enhance the bullet points by quantifying them and adding in some impact.

Still, being a Lead SWE before you even started college is a huge stretch and a red flag.\n\nYour recent Software Engineering Intern role doesn't mention any technologies or languages aside from ElectronJS, which I'm guessing was not the only one you used\n\nDon't mention negative stuff like a project that you worked on failed",

Thanks for pointing out the technologies, I'm gonna include that now.\n\nThe lead SWE role company was supposed to be a professional project, but over the months kind of ended up being like a group project so I agree with you it was kind of a stretch, thought it sounded more \"professional\" to put lead SWE. I'm doing a good amount of freelancing right now, so do you think replacing that with the \"Freelance Software Developer\" would be better (and list the projects I've worked on)?\n\nThanks for the feedback!",

Positions are quite sought after and my competitors are bound to be highly qualified. Is there anything I can do to improve my resume and my chances?\n\nMy GitHub profile is [https://github.com/kdwk](https://github.com/kdwk) . Please feel free to suggest any of my other projects to replace the ones on the resume.\n\nThanks",

I prefer Skills at the top and Education at the bottom like you have it. Some people claim that interns/new grads should have them flipped\n\nUnder Skills, put your strongest ones first. Flutter isn't a language, so hopefully it's not your strongest skill\n\nBreak your skills out into categories. Common ones are \"Languages\" and \"Frameworks\". So Java would be in Languages while Spring would be in Frameworks. \"Network I/O\" should appear or be easily inferred somewhere in your experience or projects\n\nYour second Skills bullet are mostly not needed. Those skills should be inferred from the other skills you list. Docker might be one I keep\n\nYou mention Unity and Blender in your experience, but I see it's not in your Skills. If the aviation internship uses them, then definitely add them. Otherwise, I'd still add Unity as a programming framework/tool but maybe not Blender",

Also I think you need to quantify your bullet points and make sure you are demonstrating the impact you had with them. They are already well written, but if you can add some impact then we are going to have a much stronger resume. Don't just list out your tech stack in a whole line like that. Either using some delimiter characters on the same line of just weave it in to your bullet points.

We can rewrite it to be more applicable towards SWE and that would help a lot more. Unless you are going for more than just SWE and other types of jobs than maybe it is worth something.\n\nThere is no need to have a Personal Skills section and can be entirely removed.

FastAPI, GraphQL, and Google Cloud are the technologies. i'm interested in the product-level impact. this could be as simple as naming the team, or the nature of the work.\n\nfor cisco, i'm curious why the experience is only one month (june to july)? that's <10 weeks. but aside from that this looks excellent. i would consider coalescing the first and third data points. it reads as, \"i built an app for farmer's markets. to build this, i used firebase and google maps API. the app does XYZ\". instead, it might be more pleasant for a recruiter to read logically as, \"i built an app for farmer's markets that does XYZ. i used firebase/google maps API.\" this also gives the second bullet point a lot more meaningful context.\n\nprojects look fantastic. this resume will go very far as long as you consider these small nits (but ultimately decide what's best for you). good luck!",

I would say try and focus in on getting a few more metrics in there and also a bit more specifics for frontend related things. For example your last bullet point on your Research Assistant experience basically says nothing at all. Remember when writing bullet points you have to be conveying the impact you made and exactly how you did it. General stuff like \"collaborating on Agile workflows\" and just \"using React for frontend\" says basically nothing at all. I like the formatting and use of space overall, but just strengthening the bullet points and tech stacks would get you further. If you are having problems with landing interviews and stuff I don't think the resume is holding you back too much. I have other suggestions for you that could boost your results, but this should be a good starting point.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need your resume reviewed in detail or have questions on anything about the whole process.

You don't need to say you are demonstrating innovation and technical expertise - show it instead by directly listing what you did. There is very little actual content that is relevant to SWE on this resume beyond some web scraping and 2 lines on CV. I feel like you probably have done a lot more, but just haven't included it on this resume (I have an upcoming guide I am posting on this subreddit that should help students with this because I see this a lot). Also there is no need to dedicate 5 lines to your relevant coursework. Focus in on things for SWE and cut that down.

This will make a massive improvement. Strictly follow the template and try not to add in your own sections or anything else. Everything on the resume should be able to fit into that. Also you are missing the impact that you have achieved with these projects/experiences. Recruiters and ATS loves to see numbers and impact. How many people did you help, how much time was saved, what % of users blah blah you get the idea. There is a common framework called the XYZ framework that can you help rewrite your bullet points like this.

It explains how to build a strong, software-focused resume. I have a bunch more improvements in mind, but those should be good to get you started.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need your resume reviewed in detail or have questions on anything about the whole process. Good luck!",

I\u2019d recommend using a clean template like [this one](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) to improve the formatting.\n\nIn the education section, make sure to include your dates. There\u2019s no need to list your languages (English, Turkish, German) unless you\u2019re specifically applying to regions where those are relevant.\n\nIf your projects are open source, hyperlink them to make it easier for reviewers to explore. Your bullet points read a bit too long. Break them into smaller, more concise points and focus on demonstrating impact. Include measurable results or stats where possible.\n\nYour work experience doesn\u2019t seem related to software engineering, so it may not add much value here. I\u2019d recommend replacing or de-emphasizing it and instead focusing on adding more software engineering content. Full-stack projects, in particular, seem to be missing from your resume. I have a bunch more improvements in mind, but those should be good to get you started.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need your resume reviewed in detail or have questions on anything about the whole process.

Is this a software engineering course? You can be flexible with the naming to better communicate the objective.\n\n- I'd avoid putting start dates on education since employers may use it in subconscious biases (gauging your age, seeing if you take longer than 4 years to graduate, etc.). All you need is the graduation date.\n\n- If you've received any notable awards/recognitions/scholarships from your college/university (e.g. Dean's List), list them.\n\n- Include links to projects as proof-of-work. If the GitHub icons are links, use a text link instead (e.g. \"FileCompressor (github.com/...) | Technologies...\").\n\n- Your projects state what you did, but not the significance of them (e.g. why you did the work you did). You could quantify your results, whether through XYZ (\"Implemented a Huffman coding lossless file compressor to compress text files to save 10% in storage usage\", \"Implemented a Huffman coding lossless file compressor that supports a throughput of 1,000+ text files exceeding 1 MB each\", etc.) or sheer technical might (i.e. more keywords).\n\n- Experience should never be at the bottom of a resume. I recommend putting it after Education. It's common for section items to be ordered from newest to oldest, so I'd put Video Editor above VEX Robotics Team Lead. The bullet points for Video Editor make me think you could spin your experience as Video Project Coordinator (you can stretch your titles so-long you don't outright lie). Finally, some employers only consider experience to encapsulate professional work and not extracurriculars. If this is ever a concern, you could rename the section to \"Activities\" (it would still be above Projects).",

Use month and year for dates and not the semester (e.g. Spring 2026 \u2192 May 2026).\n\n- Since you haven\u2019t graduated yet, prefix the date with \u201cExpected\u201d or \u201cGraduating.\u201d\n\n- You don't need to list your precise GPA, nor format it to a comfortable precision. Use a single decimal (3.37 \u2192 3.3).\n\n- Data Structures & Algorithms is the general baseline for coursework a recruiter is looking for. You can drop Programming Fundamentals 1 & 2. For math, it\u2019s anything above Calculus, so include Discrete Mathematics, Probability & Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc. if you have/are taking them.\n\n- You have a Technical Skills and a Skills section. Merge them into one (I like to title mine \u201cKnowledge/Skills\u201d, but \u201cSkills\u201d is fine). I'd personally drop the Python certificate since you're in college, but I'm not sure of the hispanic recognition award.\n\n- A good place to look for skills is in job descriptions. If you know other skills that would be relevant to the jobs you\u2019re applying for (e.g. SQL in full-stack), include them. Just from reading your resume, I\u2019d add REST API, Bootstrap, Linux (Ubuntu \u2192 Ubuntu Linux), and PyQt.\n\n- Projects are usually considered small-scale and don\u2019t feature titles like \u201cFull Stack Web Developer\u201d, \u201cTeam Developer\u201d, etc. If you worked with many people, I\u2019d suggest moving it to an \u201cActivities\u201d section so you can keep the titles (at least, it\u2019s what I do in my own resume). Also, include links to your projects as proof-of-work (GitHub repository, live website, demo, etc.).\n\n- Be consistent with your terminology (Digital Ocean, DigitalOcean).\n\n- You state what you did and the technical purpose of your actions, but not the result for end users. If one of your deliverables were a cancel button, you\u2019d state it allowed customers avoid phone or in-person cancellations, saving customers and staff time. Look up the XYZ method for more information.\n\n- \u201cRegistered a domain on Namecheap\u201d is very administrative. Can you reframe it to more closely relate to software development? (e.g. managing DNS records).\n\n- Resume reviewers like seeing numbers. Instead of \u201cacross multiple locations\u201d, can you use a number? (\u201cacross 6 locations\u201d, \u201cacross 10+ locations\u201d, \u201cacross 50+ locations in 5 states\u201d, etc.)\n\n- You can reserve versioning for the skills section (PyQt6 \u2192 PyQt, Ubuntu \u2192 Ubuntu Linux (24.04 LTS)).\n\n- Use more proactive adjectives, as opposed to passive ones (\u201cUtilized\u201d, \u201cBuilt\u201d, \u201cContributed\u201d bad; \u201cDeveloped\u201d, \u201cImplemented\u201d, \u201cLed\u201d good). This goes for roles, too (\u201cMember, Contributor\u201d \u2192 \u201cFellow\u201d).\n\n- If you have work experience of any capacity (even unrelated to the positions you\u2019re applying), I\u2019d add an \u201cExperience\u201d section. It helps to show you have some experience in a work environment (though, informal work like freelancing works, too).\n\n- Try to make use of all the space on your resume (i.e. the bottom).\n\nDoes your career center offer a service like Quinncia to grade your resume? I'd use it to gather more feedback.",

If you think it\u2019s a concern, you could note your residency status (US citizen, US permanent resident, etc.).\n\nAs for the resume,\n\n- If you have a portfolio, include it in the header.\n\n- For your two internships, it is a strategy for some to drop the \u201cIntern\u201d label for credibility. However, it may backfire if the recruiter assumes you\u2019re inflating your experience. While I personally don\u2019t mind it, it is something to consider.\n\n- The following is fluff.

I\u2019d list it first or second.\n\n- Sub-bullets are generally not recommended [unless you really have a lot to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1aubkdq/15yoe_successfully_received_nvidia_offer_design/). Try flattening them and using the first bullet to lead the others.\n\n- The best resumes imo are specific about conveying their objective. \u201cvarious issues\u201d which ones? \u201ccritical site components\u201d list them right there. \u201coverseeing the integration of extensive contributions from each team member\u201d can you name the contributions, the number and type of people you oversaw, or methodologies you used? Look into the XYZ method as well as [r/EngineeringResumes\u2019s Action Verbs](https://reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/index#wiki_action_verbs).\n\n- Include links to your projects as proof-of-work (repository, live website, demo, etc.).\n\n- Since you haven\u2019t graduated yet, your Education section should be the first section of your resume.\n\n- List your GPA if it\u2019s notable (I prefer 3.0+, but others say 3.3+, 3.5+, 3.8+, etc.).\n\n- List your relevant coursework (for Computer Science, it\u2019s Data Structures & Algorithms and above; for Mathematics, it\u2019s anything above Calculus, like Discrete Mathematics, Probability & Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc.).\n\n- I\u2019d merge \u201cFrameworks\u201d, \u201cDeveloper Tools\u201d, and \u201cVersion Control\u201d into a \u201cSoftware\u201d category, given the length (I\u2019d drop VS Code, PyCharm, GitHub, and GitLab, too, given they\u2019re not difficult to learn, but it depends on the job description). Adding more skills would help, too.\n\nI'd focus on expanding the experience section, as well as giving the recruiter a better sense of the actions' importance.

The only auto-rejects you really have to worry about are prerequisite questions like requiring sponsorship.\n\nOn the resume itself,\n\n- Data Structures & Algorithms is the baseline recruiters are looking for, so you can drop Fundamentals of Computer Programming. You can rename your courses to better convey the subject to recruiter.\n\n  - Intro to AI \u2192 Artificial Intelligence\n\n  - Data Science with Python \u2192 Data Science\n\n  - Mathematical Fundamentals of Programming? (not sure what this is)\n\n- I\u2019ve never been involved in a fraternity, so I\u2019m unaware of the weight mentioning one adds to your resume (\u201cTechnological Fratemity KTP\u201d). However, I would suggest adding notable awards/scholarships/recognitions (e.g. Dean\u2019s List), as well as listing your GPA if it\u2019s notable (I prefer 3.0+, but others say 3.3+, 3.5+, 3.8+, etc.). \n\n- Your first experience bullet point is a run-on sentence and hard to read. I suggest taking the skills after \u201cutilizing\u201d and putting them before \u201cwith 100% detection rate\u201d (you can condense the information to better achieve this).\n\n- I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best to showcase how you used certain technologies than to simply list them. Can you show how you used Docker, Django, and ProgreSQL? Also, replace \u201cwebsite\u201d with \u201cthe website.\u201d In fact, since you opened a new revenue stream, do you have a money amount to demonstrate it\u2019s contribution? (e.g. $1M+)\n\n- \u201cCollaborated projects\u201d \u2192 \u201cCollaborated on projects.\u201d \u201cCollaborated\u201d is passive\u2014can you use a more proactive term that demonstrates your usefulness? (e.g. \u201cDelivered\u201d)\n\n- I like to reserve \u201cExperience\u201d for employee to employer relationships. If your University Club Software Engineer and University Peer Mentor positions did not have that dynamic, I\u2019d move it to an \u201cActivities\u201d section, but do note this is my personal opinion.\n\n- A technique I like to use to grade the weight of a bullet point is to read it and ask, \u201cso what?\u201d \u201cCollaborated on Figma mockups and produced prototypes with alternative frameworks including Node.JS\u201d tells me you did something, but not the value of it. Look into the XYZ method for tips.\n\n- For your Peer Mentor role, it would be helpful to record the rate at which students improved (e.g. 20% improvement). Also, \u201cfor class of over 200 students over 15 assignments and quizzes throughout the quarter\u201d \u2192 \u201cfor a class of 200+ students across 15 assignments and quizzes throughout [the quarter]\u201d, where [the quarter] is its name (e.g. Fall 2023, Spring 2024). Given the recruiter is spending ~10 seconds to read your resume, it helps to reduce their need to interpret.\n\n- I like to cap my number of projects to 3 at most. Would you be open to removing a project and using the extra space to expanding the remaining ones?\n\n- Projects are a technical showcase, but you still need to communicate their value to a recruiter (e.g. you know a certain technology they\u2019re looking for). Your first project tells me you know how to use \u201clarge data\u201d from some \u201cdatabase\u201d, which is pretty nebulous to a recruiter who likely doesn\u2019t know what that is. Can you name the frontend and backend technologies used in your Stock Market Web App? SQL Environment sounds cool\u2014can you frame it as a simulation? etc.\n\n- Include links to your projects as proof-of-work (repository, live website, demo, etc.) and make sure it\u2019s runnable (if it\u2019s an executable, record a demo or take screenshots).\n\n- You don\u2019t need soft skills like additional interests on a resume. For relevant skills, look in the job description.",

I\u2019d stop bolding keywords since it\u2019s otherwise annoying to process the resume, but this is my opinion. Some people have success with it, but I feel it creates more issues than it solves.\n\n- I\u2019m not sure if API calls is the best metric to demonstrate impact (I\u2019d prefer a dollar amount), but \u201cdemonstrating immediate impact with enterprise clients\u201d is already implied by \u201c24 enterprises used the SDK through these examples.\u201d I\u2019d look to putting the metric (\"2000+ API calls...\") before the mention of the no. of enterprises (\"24 enterprises...\") to make it read naturally.\n\n- \u201creducing manual errors and speeding up development cycle\u201d by how much?\n\n- \u201cDeployed and presented web apps with the ASP.NET server stack on Microsoft Azure App Service\u201d you show your technical capability, but not its impact. I\u2019d look to merging this with the bullet point above, as they seem related.\n\n- \u201cdeepening student understanding on image extraction\u201d I feel that accomplishments leading to unquantified results is not the best way to leave impact. Instead, how about mentioning the coursework after Computer Vision (image extraction) so you can end with how it impacted 130+ students?\n\n- \u201cAnswered or assisted on 40+ course forum questions about programming assignments and conceptual questions\u201d I\u2019ve never been a TA, but is this just you guiding students towards answering the problems? I don\u2019t think it sounds impactful enough to mention on a resume. The same goes for the bullet point immediately following. However, it does sound relevant to the coursework. Could you perhaps merge the two (and perhaps the first bullet point) so the impact is clear?\n\n- Unless the startup had no headquarters at all (which I doubt), you should put the location even if it was a remote role.\n\n- \u201cimpacting 7000+ users\u201d for such a short line, you may as well use a comma-less sentence and mention the metric in the middle of the sentence. For example, \u201cLed the development of a website frontend used by 7K+ users using React.js and Next.js\u201d.\n\n- Securing Y Combinator funding sounds very impressive to me. I\u2019d try to lead with this and reduce the busyness of the remaining sentence (unless the company is looking for Kanban experience, I\u2019d drop it and just keep the mention of agile).\n\n- \u201cincluding profile changes, likes, dislikes, and question notes\u201d you don\u2019t need to state what those user interactions were (I think it\u2019s needless content on the resume).\n\n- \u201cDeployed a machine learning model improving Sharpe Ratio by 22% in backtests, managing over $100 million in assets\u201d \u2192 \u201cDeployed a machine learning model to improve the Sharpe Ratio by 22% in backtests, managing over $100 million in assets\u201d. I\u2019m not sure if the person reviewing your resume will immediately know what a Sharpe Ratio is, so it may help to link it to finance in the first sentence, like you do in the second bullet. The whole experience, in fact, reads like a mix of data analytics and machine learning. Could you lead it in a way where this is more clearly communicated?\n\n- Include the project\u2019s GitHub repository link in the header so it\u2019s obvious at first glance.\n\n- Except for Language, all the sections listed are technical skills. I\u2019d rename Technical Skills to Programming. If you want to save on space, I\u2019d merge Development Tools and Web Frameworks into a Software section.\n\n- Reading your whole resume, it seems your coursework, work experience, and projects demonstrate your proficiency in data science and machine learning. If so, I\u2019d remove the Certificates section outright since your university coursework in the two will make up for it.",
