It was usually a combination of some junior HRs, marketing team, and their PR teams having joint access to these accounts. Sometimes they would consult technical team (SWEs) for inputs but that's not a common occurrence. These teams were usually located in Microsoft India's marketing-focused offices like the one in Mumbai. But I could be missing out a wider picture on this one as there might be similar teams by Microsoft in almost every continent they operate in, if not every country. They had to monitor and engage more actively during a big announcement, launch of a new product, or a new event hosted by the company, to make their hashtags more trending and increase brand engagement and product evangelism.  \nJust build apps or softwares using their products like the latest .Net, Azure, Visual Studio (not VS code), and deploy them on windows app store by creating a developer account, and share about it on TikTok or X(Twitter) and tag them, there is a high likelihood that they'll start following you with that account as well.",
