Given physiological changes that occur across menstrual cycle, the changes to the brain are either small enough that they don't influence performance or women compensate for these changes.",

Years later I found out I not only had PMDD, but endometriosis and adenomyosis that the Mirena is actually used to treat. So I found the treatment for my disorders on my own out of desperation. \n\nIn hindsight, it's upsetting that no doctors cared to find out why my periods were making my life unlivable. They just brush you off saying \"some women just get heavier periods/worse cramps\". But once I got the Mirena I realized how abnormal it was and how insane it was that I ever had to live like that. All of this to say, if your periods are severely impacting you, there are things can be done about it. It could be something like adenomyosis or endometriosis, which there are treatments for.

Menstruation continues to be a taboo topic, subject to myths about how it affects women. Despite the considerable number of empirical studies, there have been few quantitative summaries of what is known. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of cognitive performance across the menstrual cycle, including the domains of attention, creativity, executive functioning, intelligence, motor function, spatial ability, and verbal ability. We included studies that measured women\u2019s performance at specific points in the cycle for tasks that have objectively correct responses. Our analysis examined performance differences across phases using Hedges\u2019 g as the effect size metric. Across 102 articles, N =\u2009 3,943 participants, and 730 comparisons, we observe no systematic robust evidence for significant cycle shifts in performance across cognitive performance. Although two results appeared significant with respect to differences in spatial ability, they arise from a large number of statistical tests and are not supported in studies that use robust methods to determine cycle phase. Through the use of Egger\u2019s test, and examination of funnel plots, we did not observe evidence of publication bias or small-study effects. We examined speed and accuracy measures separately within each domain, and no robust differences across phases appeared for either speed or accuracy. We conclude that the body of research in this meta-analysis does not support myths that women\u2019s cognitive abilities change across the menstrual cycle. Future research should use larger sample sizes and consistent definitions of the menstrual cycle, using hormonal indicators to confirm cycle phase.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nAustralian-led research has found no evidence to support the myth that women\u2019s cognitive abilities change across the menstrual cycle. The researchers looked at 102 studies covering close to 4000 women and looked at changes in everything from attention, intelligence and executive functioning to motor function, spatial ability, verbal ability and creativity. The authors say although menstruation is often treated like a disease that impairs women\u2019s ability to function, they found no evidence for significant changes in cognitive performance across the cycle. The authors say that while this is somewhat surprising given the physiological changes that occur across the menstrual cycle, the changes to the brain are either small enough that they don't influence performance or women compensate for these changes in ways we don't yet understand.",

The authors say although menstruation is often treated like a disease that impairs women\u2019s ability to function, they found no evidence for significant changes in cognitive performance across the cycle. The authors say that while this is somewhat surprising given the physiological changes that occur across the menstrual cycle, the changes to the brain are either small enough that they don't influence performance or women compensate for these changes in ways we don't yet understand.\u201d\n\nTo elaborate on ToWriteAMystery\u2019s comment, the physical symptoms your coworker experiences are most likely to explain for their absence. Common symptoms, especially in the first 1-2 days are menstrual cramping, diarrhea, lower back pain, menstrual bleeding, headaches, fatigue, acne, breast pain,etc. The severity can range from mild to severe and this can even change from cycle to cycle for many. Some of these can easily be debilitating or at the very least make it very difficult to concentrate on something other than the pain. \n\nI would also argue that just because this is something women experience regularly does not make it less of a burden. This includes the mood changes (which don\u2019t affect our ability to make decisions, but may make us tolerate less BS). Again, think of the mood changes in combination with everything else.

Like the neural networks built over decades to speak English aren't just evaporating and reconstructing themselves in parallel with her cycle. \n\nSo there is continuity in structure there.\n\nBut that being said, she is absolutely higher in neuroticism during those periods and that absolutely has observable impacts on what she spends her time thinking about.\n\nTo put another way, it's like the engine itself has not changed, but what the engine is being pointed AT has changed. Rather than focusing on a present task, she may instead prioritize scrutinizing the future. \n\nAnd I'm not all that prepared to say that it's a bad idea to occasionally focus on the future. After all, that's where all the bad stuff will happen. In the future is the winter that kills us all. \n\nAt most I'll see in terms of \"worse\" cognition may be in the overemphasizing of risk. \n\nYou know as I talk myself through this it makes me question what the utility of a piece of science like this even serves.",
