It had to be a lot!\n\nI don't think that is what is being implied here. From these excerpts, I think it's more about detecting drug abuse epidemics. \n\n\n>\u201cWe have developed highly sensitive instruments that filter through nitazenes in preparation for them to make their way to Australia,\u2019\u2019 Dr Bade said.\n\n>\u201cThrough this method we were able to detect concentrations as low as 0.01 nanograms per litre, with there being 1 billion nanograms per gram.\n\n>\"Analyses can take place in real-time and data can be obtained in days to weeks so findings can be relayed to relevant authorities.\n\n>\u201cGoing forward we hope to establish a complementary surveillance tool to support the rapid deployment of public health interventions before harm occurs and becomes widespread.\"\n\nDrug laced urine, maybe? I don't know if it's possible to track how much users are in an area, but if I wanted to know how much drugs people are using, wastewater is where I'd look.",
