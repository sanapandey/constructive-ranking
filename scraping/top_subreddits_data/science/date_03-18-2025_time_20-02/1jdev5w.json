I start to feel disgust when people want to use it to skirt responsibility for their unborn children. To me, this feels similar to people who abuse children for their own enjoyment. The willingness to end a developing childs life so that they can have unprotected sex for pleasure is appalling to me, and it has nothing to do with religion.",

If you don\u2019t consent to sex you didn\u2019t consent to the risk and while end such is still wrong forcing you to continue also is, then each weigh.\n\nAssumption of risk is a fairly historic and well supported concept in Anglican law, it most appears on skiing tickets, contact sports (see the debate on assault when the hit is clearly wrong), and combatant privilege these days.",

Sex generally leads to pregnancy, so with consensual sex the argument is that you're trying to have your cake and eat it too. They think that \"consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy\" is an oxymoron.\n\n\nThe rape exception is more like the self-defense exception or other defenses to murder charges.\u00a0\n\n\nHere's an example from the jurisdiction in my country. Imagine you're in danger of drowning and no one's there to help you. But there's another person also trying to survive, but this person has some kind of a floatation device. You take it away from them, you survive and they drown. In my country you would not be cinvicted for doing that, UNLESS the situation is your own fault.\n\n\nIt's the same thinking as pro-lifers who are in favour of rape exceptions. Consensual sex= the situation is a result of your actions.\nRape= the situation is the result of someone else's actions.\n\n\n\n\nThere are people who are not in favour of that though. The Catholic Church for example. For them it's similar to killing an already born rapist's child, because looking at them gives you flashbacks.",

Here are some key differences between how historical and modern societies relate to property:\nThe concept of property has undergone significant transformations across history, shaped by economic structures, social relations, and political ideologies. Here are some key differences between how historical and modern societies relate to property:\n\n\n\n1. Communal vs. Private Property\n\n\u2022 Historical Societies: Many pre-modern and indigenous societies had forms of communal property, where land and resources were shared among a tribe, village, or kinship group. Property was often linked to use rather than individual ownership.\n\n\u2022 Modern Societies: Property today is largely individualistic, with legal frameworks enforcing private ownership. Capitalist economies treat land, resources, and even intellectual property as commodities that can be bought, sold, and inherited.\n\n\n\n2. Land and Agriculture\n\n\u2022 Historical Societies: In feudal Europe, land was not owned in the modern sense but held under obligations\u2014lords granted land to vassals in exchange for service, and peasants worked the land in return for protection. Similarly, in ancient agrarian empires, land was often controlled by the state or ruling elites, with peasants granted access under various tenancy or tribute systems.\n\n\u2022 Modern Societies: The transition to capitalism, particularly after the enclosures in Europe and colonial land grabs, led to land becoming a commodity. Today, land ownership is a legal right that can be transferred through markets rather than a status-based privilege or duty.\n\n\n\n3. Labor and Ownership\n\n\u2022 Historical Societies: Labor was often directly tied to land and subsistence. In feudalism, serfs were bound to the land, while in slave societies, people were property themselves. Guilds in medieval Europe controlled access to trades, limiting property in the means of production.\n\n\u2022 Modern Societies: The rise of wage labor severed the direct connection between labor and property. Today, most people do not own the means of production but sell their labor for wages. Property, particularly in capitalist societies, is concentrated in fewer hands, leading to wealth disparities.",

This applies to all similar phrases such as 'mature for your age,' and 'level headed.'  \nI will refer to my daughters' friends by their first name, or 'Ms' and their last name, not nicknames like 'kiddo' or 'hot stuff.'  \nI will refrain from (and stop all current) checking out my daughter's female friends' butts.  Nor will I give them compliments when the clothing they are wearing makes their butts look particularly good.  Or bad.  Or anything.  Essentially, comments about their jeans, sweaters, or other revealing/not-revealing clothing are off limits.  \nThe word \"dayyyyummm\" will never pass my lips.  \nI won't go to restaurants whose ambiance is based on female body parts, and strip clubs are completely off limits.  \nI will refrain from watching porn.  Note: Youtube channels featuring young women/girls in revealing clothing count as porn.  \nIn the event that I am even able to find and attract a woman of an age appropriate to mine, I will not have sex with her until we are married.  Not even a handy on the way home, like your mom used to give me on 'date nights.'\"",

Both husband and wife are supposed to focus on their spouse's pleasure as a good sex life is considered a sacred thing.

The only reason you find it weird that they would be adamant about not having sex before marriage (which is a sin, and they would caution you to not do any given sin) is because we've divorced the idea that sex and marriage are one in the same.",

Conviction of Sin is simply no longer relying on moral relativism for judgement but relying on only God. Jesus/God is VERY strict regarding lust (to the point of thought crimes levels), so casual sex is a sin. So obviously to them, if you know you are sinning, but still does it, it's through lack of control and impulse.\n\nThis view towards lust/sex is obviously not applicable to non-believers, but if your ONLY world view is a Christian one, it doesn't make sense to them that not everyone will agrees (the religious equivalent of \"let them eat cake\"). This is incorrect assumption of their part on the literally first step.\n\nEven if religion isn't a factor, I don't think casual sex is good for either party and social in general. It reduces the ability of females to neurologically bond with their partners (decreased oxytocin release during sex). It increases instability of the social system through hypergamy (look at arab spring for what happens when you get too many single males in a failed state). But, if it isn't illegal, then do whatever you want.",

I think it\u2019s important to give people, that choice too since not everyone has your belief. Even in Judeo based faith there are gradients.\n\nSome faiths, including Unitarian Universalism, Reform and Conservative Judaism, and certain mainline Protestant denominations like the Episcopal Church and Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), generally support a woman's right to choose abortion.\n\nIf the argument is on if the unborn are considered murder as you phrased it; The issue of fetal homicide laws and the legal status of a fetus have been the subject of legal challenges and debates, particularly in the context of abortion and reproductive rights.\u00a0\n\nTexas as an example currently bans abortion in all cases, except in instances of very narrowly defined medical emergencies. Health providers who are found in violation of the law could face life in prison, in addition to a civil penalty of no less than $100,000. Last year, the state Supreme Court refused to clarify the scope of the ban\u2019s exceptions, ruling against more than 20 women who were denied medically necessary abortion care. Though the law exempts abortion seekers themselves from prosecution, that hasn\u2019t stopped overzealous prosecutors from attempting to charge patients themselves in the past. Surgical procedures and medication for miscarriages are identical to those for abortion, and some patients report delayed or denied miscarriage care because doctors and pharmacists fear running afoul of abortion bans. I think they deserve care also but I can understand if our values don\u2019t align. I did want to state this though as there is a lot of misinformation.\n\nPart of my suggestion is similar to what the other person suggested: increasing sex ed and healthcare access including pre and post natal care, birth control and the like. When we support the start of families with resources, you tend to get more people realizing it\u2019s feasible to keep their child. When you support the access of birth control, you make it easier for planned pregnancies to occur. Things along this nature really help. Sometimes that\u2019s also going to mean miscarriage care and otherwise.",

This book is his attempt to explain the causes of the seemingly diverse phenomena of capitalism and Protestantism\u2026 In his introduction to The Protestant Ethic Max Weber points out that greed and the desire for personal gain, as well as trading and other economic enterprises designed to make a profit, exist everywhere and have been true of people in all walks of life and in all cultures of the earth. This human impulse to acquire wealth does not necessarily have anything to do with capitalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior to the Reformation it was widely believed among Christians that the only way to overcome worldliness was through self-denial and monastic asceticism. In contrast to this view, the Protestant idea of having a calling meant more than merely having a job to do. Believing that you had a calling also meant believing that the only way to live acceptably in the sight of God was through fulfilling the obligations imposed on you by your position in the world. Only through your calling could you do the will of God.\u201d\n\nhttps://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/protestant-ethic-of-prosperity",

I I had to take a guess based upon my own experience there might be a difference due to Catholics and seventh day Adventist (where I went) or others that own hospitals and transition a lot of their students to medical fields.

What I mean by that is this study looked at the policies to reduce abortion that were most likely to be supported by pro lifers and found that they favored those policies which discouraged casual sex over policies that didn\u2019t. Likewise I suspect a similar study looking at pro choicers would reveal a similar bias, that is I believe pro choicers would more likely support abortion policies that encouraged casual sex or at least didn\u2019t discourage it vs policies that did even if those policies reduced abortions.\n\nThis was actually shown to be true in Casey vs Planned Parenthood in which is was argued before court that abortion was necessary in case contraception failed so abortion could be used as a form of \u201cback up contraception\u201d essentially this deviates from the main argument of \u201cautonomy\u201d that is commonly used in public debate. \n\nI suspect that the abortion debate was and always has been a debate about sex first and foremost but I don\u2019t think most people want to be honest about that",

Maybe we have a different meaning to the word principle -- I understood the \"principle\" in this discussion to be \"abortions should be banned or stigmatized\" with the goal of \"eliminate abortions\", since the examples given were \"abstinence only\" and \"don't murder people\", which would be spawned off of goals of reducing casual sex and reducing murder.\n\nI used the laws as an example of such a course of action, but my point was not restricted to legislation. Put broadly -- we should shape our guiding principles and actions based on whether they actually bring about our ideals, instead of getting stuck telling reality that it is \"existing wrong\". Looking at Mama_Mush's posts, they also appear to be talking about letting results guide our plans and actions.\n\nFor instance, my goal is to have less dead babies. When I was young, I thought that implied a principle of seeking to ban abortions.

As evidence, I'm pointing to how conclusions that *do* stem from a single \"life is sacred\" or \"eliminate abortion\" principle are rejected by those society identifies as Pro-Life, and that the OP study gives evidence that there are other principles (edit: and combinations of principles) that are much more compatible as bases of their conclusions.\n\n\nIt is definitely possible to go from the starting point \"life is sacred\", but the conclusions consistent with that don't match what society identifies as \"Pro-Life\".

I mean isn\u2019t the argument for sex education and contraception access about reducing abortion rates? Also even if you have no moral qualms about abortion it is generally better to avoid pregnancy than to become pregnant and abort, it\u2019s more expensive for one and more dangerous. \n\nBut you\u2019re right whether they seek to reduce abortions or not doesn\u2019t tell us their motivations for supporting abortion. So maybe that\u2019s a bad example the point is that limiting access to elective abortions does conflict with casual sex and this has been brought up in abortion debates. For example in Casey vs PP the argument for elective abortion was that it was necessary to be used as back up contraception. \n\n>To be a sensible comparison, you\u2019d have to look at policies that both align with the stated goal but have varying alignment with unstated motivations.

You could teach sex ed regardless of whether or not elective abortion is legal or considered moral. You can teach about STIs, how the reproductive organs work, etc.. which I learned at my Catholic school complete with anatomy diagrams. Yet we were also taught that abortion was immoral (not saying everyone believed this but it was taught). One is a matter of biology and the other is philosophical conjecture. So sex education may be correlated with reduced teen sexual activity but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201cpro choice\u201d",

That might not be the only reason but it\u2019s certainly considered a good reason amongst others. Typically abortion is seen as a \u201clast resort\u201d solution to an unintended pregnancy, but most people would prefer not to experience an unintended pregnancy at all versus getting pregnant by accident and then having to have an abortion so it makes sense regardless of the abortion debate to promote sex ed, if it reduces unintended pregnancies and thus abortions. For example, in states where abortion is legal and accessible people are still actively trying to reduce unintended pregnancies especially in teens. It\u2019s not like the thinking is \u201cwell they can all just get abortions so we don\u2019t need to worry about reducing unintended pregnancies.\u201d\n\n>Because making informed choices requires both information and choices: you need the ability to make a choice (legal rights, accessibility, etc), but you also need to know what the options and possibilities are.

Sex ed is one essential element of giving people power over their own bodies.\n\nBut on its face sex ed doesn\u2019t make any moral judgments about abortion that is you could teach sexual education without promoting abortion. For example, I went to a Catholic high school. We did have comprehensive sex education that is we learned about the body parts. We learned how the reproductive organs work. We learned about various STI\u2019s, contraceptive methods and about pregnancy and gestational development. However, my high school also taught that abortion and contraception was immoral in accordance with the Catholic church\u2019s teachings (I don\u2019t fully agree with that take but that\u2019s not the point), but that wasn\u2019t part of our sex ed class that was part of our religious and \u201cmorality\u201d class so I think that you\u2019re correlating things here. On one hand you have education on the facts of the matter, biology, disease, reproduction etc\u2026the other is about the morality or the ethics of it, which is a philosophical question. And for the record, my high school had zero teen pregnancies when I was there granted it was full of upper middle class students so the likelihood of an unintended pregnancy was probably low just based on demographics.",

That is the logic of \"you consent to the risk so you get no treatment of the consequence.\" This is not how most people actually believe consent and risk work and it's not how our society is set up. Similarly, lifeguards are supposed to help people drowning rather than chide them because they \"knew the risk.\"\n\nThe drunk driving comparison is even more absurd because drunk driving *is illegal* but having sex *is not illegal* and still you would be an absolute ghoul to suggest that drunk drivers should be barred from receiving medical care. Our society acknowledges that even breaking the law does not bar you from getting medical care that minimizes the harm - someone harmed in a bank robbery or attempted murder is still entitled to medical care, we don't let them bleed out because they \"consent to the risk.\"",

If paternity hasn't been established and only the mother has parental rights then she can relinquish all on her own.  And it can be difficult to get parental rights back after a child has been relinquished, particularly if paternity wasn't established ahead of time.  Varies a lot by state and specific situation.  Either way that is a whole different issue that is kinda getting off of my main point.\n\n> that is wholly irrelevant to the fact that we do hold parents responsible for merely having sex.\n\nWhat do you mean by *\"hold responsible\"*?  Because the fact that (*at least where I live*) \n\n- we allow things like vasectomies, condoms, IUDs, birth control pills to reduce/prevent pregnancies.\n- we allow Plan B and other morning after options to stop pregnancies from happening immediately after sex.\n- we allow abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies if one has occured.\n\nTo me demonstrates that we don't really hold parents responsible for having sex as long as they seek out the proper options.  There are plenty of pre, during and post options to basically remove the need for parental responsibility for adults having sex.\n\nTo me being held responsible means that there is a consequence that you cannot avoid.  If you rob a bank and are caught by police, you're going to be held responsible by having to go through the legal system.  Go to court, pay fines, get incarcerated, be on probation, etc.  The consequences you're held to are unavoidable and there are systems in place to quite literally force you to take on those consequences.\n\nThat isn't the case (*again at least where I live*) for unwanted pregnancies or having sex.",

I simply point out a contradiction in the claim \"Having sex is consenting to having a child\" by case of rape (where by definition consent isn't possible) and where termination isn't possible.\n\nIf both statements are the same, meaning equal, then proving one has a contradiction proves that both do (logically speaking).\n\nI don't think you're familiar with how logical arguments flow, but if you want my best faith attempt at stating your own argument for you, it would be this:\n\n\"If claim A is true, then it necessarily follows that claim B is true.\"\n\nThis differs from saying \"Claim A and claim B are the same claim in X case.\", which is flawed from the outset because you're attempting to specially plead that A = not A.

I'm being good faith, but your position is one I'm holistically unconvinced by. I'm going to take what you say as you say it because I cannot be in your head and understand your position as you understand it.\n\nFrom my perspective, your argument has changed, or you're trying to say your argument was not as it was presented to begin with, and this better phrasing is the *real* argument you're trying to make. Whichever the case doesn't really matter. Your new argument is still incoherent.\n\n> So if a man consents to sex and a child is born from said sex mere consent to sex(and the involved act) makes the male responsible for that child, which makes the two functionally, in the context of this discusson, the same.\n\nAgain, no. You're making the same mistake. It's entirely possible the man and the woman agree that the man bears no responsibility for any potential child well before any sex occurs. Any scenario in which someone is *fully* unable to relinquish responsibility I would define as forced, or non consensual. Which would contradict this being a consentual encounter.\n\nBecause of the above, your argument is flawed. It is not the case that merely consenting to sex, and a child arising out of that act, makes (for some reason you specified the male?) the male responsible for the child.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve linked to the press release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nPro-Life Policy Preferences Partly Reflect Desires to Suppress Casual Sexual Behavior, Not Solely Sanctity of Life Concerns\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506251320681\n\nAbstract\n\nPro-life individuals often emphasize sanctity-of-life concerns as driving their opposition to abortion. This implies the straightforward prediction that the more strongly people oppose abortion for such reasons (e.g., \u201cabortion is murder\u201d), the more they will endorse policies preventing abortions (face-value account). An alternative suggests that typically nonconscious reproductive goals (e.g., discouraging casual sex) influence policy preferences; this strategic account predicts a different pattern of policy endorsement: all else equal, abortion opponents will prioritize abortion-preventing policies discouraging casual sex. A pilot study and two preregistered U.S. experiments (N = 1,960) provide relatively greater support for the strategic account: the strongest abortion opponents more strongly endorse policies that prevent abortions by discouraging casual sex (e.g., abortion bans, abstinence-only sex education) over policies that do not (comprehensive sex education)\u2014even controlling for conservatism and religiosity. Commonly voiced arguments against abortion may be more rhetorically effective but less reflective of genuine drivers underlying arguers\u2019 beliefs.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nPro-life people partly motivated to prevent casual sex, study finds\n\nAbortion is murder \u2013 the emotive rallying cry popular with pro-life campaigners keen to convert others to their cause. But what if opposition to abortion isn\u2019t all about sanctity-of-life concerns, and instead at least partly about discouraging casual sex?\n\nThat\u2019s what psychology researchers found in experiments designed to test what really drives anti-abortion attitudes in the USA. The study, published today in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, challenges how most pro-life individuals justify their views on abortion.\n\n\u201cPrevious research has sometimes assumed that pro-life attitudes are sincerely driven by beliefs about when life begins or about sanctity-of-life concerns,\u201d said Dr Jordan Moon, a social psychologist and lecturer from Brunel University of London. \u201cBut people often care deeply about the behaviour of those around them. In particular, some people believe that loose sexual norms are damaging to society. People who associate abortion rights with loose norms might thus dislike abortion.\u201d\n\nThe strongest opponents of abortion showed strong preferences against the comprehensive sex education bill, instead giving relatively more support to bills aimed at preventing abortions by punishing women for abortion, or by providing abstinence-only sex education \u2013 a bill that differed from the comprehensive sex education bill only in being explicitly opposed to casual sex. These results held even when controlling for religiosity, social conservatism and economic conservatism, suggesting that they are not simply due to religious or conservative preferences.\n\nAdditional analyses found that participants do indeed agree that the punishment and abstinence-only sex education bills are somewhat intended to \u2013 and likely to \u2013decrease casual sex, relative to the comprehensive sex education bill.",

Pro-choice people are by and large pro-life.\n\nThe debate is nearly entirely about **when human life that warrants protection begins**, *not* whether human life should be protected. Most pro-choice people believe that elective abortion should be limited after some period of gestation, typically between 20 and 28 weeks, based on when they believe protection of the fetus should kick in.\n\nMany pro-choice people believe that non-elective abortion is still an option after that point, but not without weighing the risk to the life of the fetus against the risk to life of the mother. The point here is still to preserve life as much as possible ... this is a pro-life position that is all about maximizing quality and quantity of life.\n\nOn the other side of this conversation, the \"pro-life\" side doesn't even attempt to tackle any of these issues. They often promote policies that happily fling away the life of the mother in order to protect potential (IOW, not yet actual) life.\n\nIt should be obvious to anyone that has actually researched or deeply thought about abortion that the so-called pro-life position isn't about protecting human life, it's about leveraging pregnancy in order to control women. It's not a coincidence that you don't often see pro-lifers otherwise championing women's equality, and you definitely *do* see pro-lifers align with other belief systems that seek to restrict women to traditional roles or otherwise subjugate them, e.g., religion.\n\nSpeaking of religion, it's worth pointing out the most popular rationale for the pro-life argument that \"life begins at conception,\" which is a religious belief in ensoulment. It is unbelievably difficult to pin down any pro-lifer that believes a fetus should be assigned human rights at conception to any coherent justification other than a purely religious one based on the idea that god places a soul at that moment.\n\nFortunately, in the United States, at least, once a pro-lifer admits they want to pass laws based on their religious belief, they have conceded the argument. We still have separation of church and state, at least for a little while longer. Try to get any pro-lifer to argue that human life should be assigned civil rights at conception for secular reasons. Let me know if any such arguments already exist. (They do not.)\n\nThis is what I find again and again. The pro-choice argument is deeply concerned about when we should assign civil rights to a new person, and we can be made to push back that line to err to the extreme on the side of safety ... why? Because we are actually pro-life. We want to assign civil rights to a new person with no fear that we missed the cutoff on the wrong side because we actually care about that life and want to protect it. But to pretend that line must be pushed back to conception is just empty headed nonsense.",

So\u00a0women \"assuming responsibility\" for sex\u00a0could reasonably include abortion until that point under those beliefs.\n\n\n\nThat same language being used to suggest that a woman who chose to have sex needs to carry a pregnancy as a consequence, \"be responsible for her actions\", strongly circles back again to the issue being the choice, and not whether or not the fetus is an innocent human life that we have a duty to preserve.\n\n\n\nUnder the first belief system, once a fetus becomes a full person, abortion after 20 weeks would be murder even in cases of rape. Under yours, you're saying that a fetus is *always* a whole person from the start, but should *also* be the one who bears the greatest consequences of a rape committed by another.\n\n\nThat's why I understand the \"pro-life including cases of rape\" position, even if I disagree with it.

In the US, a child's productivity over their lifetime is 1.2 to 1.6 million dollars.\n\nIf you don't have enough people replacing/building the infrastructure, then it collapses.\n\nIt seems counter intuitive, but children typically were used as a way to force young men and women together. Now of course, that wasn't always healthy - but studies show that even in unhealthy relationships, the child was better off with a mom and a dad; and less counter-intuitively, if they were in a healthy relationship those kids were miles ahead of single parents.\n\nBecause we now live in a world where hedonism is more important than legacy; people rather kill off their actual legacy and enjoy a little bit of hedonism.\n\nIt's just odd that the debate is always like \"when is a fetus a viable child\". Unless a miss carriage happens, all fetus are viable children if they are taken to term. I think women should be allowed to have abortions probably up to whatever the \"viable outside the womb\" stat is and a doctor should be able to assist with that decision, but I think there should be more incentivization to keep the child.

And if there are other reasons that help support the same conclusions people will be biased towards adopting those as additional reasons for why they are right. So if you think abortion is bad because you believe a fetus is a person then you're likely to think \"and if we ban abortion it will also deter casual sex\". Add in that a lot of pro-life people are also religious conservatives and your friend group will probably be expressing sentiments against casual sex so appreciating that reason makes you more in sync with your friends too and that's another bias.\n\nYou see the same thing with pro-choice people. People will usually endorse bodily autonomy and also emphasize that abortion prevents unwanted children and that unwanted children often have a harder life. I'm pro-choice but that reason never sat well with me. It implies that people growing up in foster care would be better off not being born. It devalues life not of fetuses which logically shouldn't be considered persons but of real people who have already been born are persons and can and do often have meaningful fulfilling lives. But it's not a point I ever bring up in real life out of fear of my friends taking it the wrong way or of possibly undermining support for reproductive freedom. Likewise pro-life people who are fine with casual sex and see using that reason in pro-life arguments as judgmental probably don't tend to raise that objection in pro-life circles when people mention as a positive that banning abortion may reduce casual sex.",

But let\u2019s be clear I said the motive to protect access to casual sex (which isn\u2019t the same as wanting to have casual sex yourself, as one could support access to casual sex while never engaging it themselves) is bigger than what is let on in the debate. \n\nBecause the reality is if a person avoids having sex they generally will not get pregnant the only exception to this would be assault but pregnancy from assault is extremely rare also in cases where assault has been made as an \u201cexception\u201d for elective abortion most pro choicers still oppose it so that does suggest some alternative motives. The idea that a person who doesn\u2019t want to become pregnant should avoid sex is also met with push back even though it\u2019s not generally considered wrong to avoid having sex in order to avoid pregnancy outside of that context. I think most people would agree that it\u2019s better to not have sex, never get pregnant and never have abortion than it is to have sex with many people and have 5 abortions.\n\nI generally always saw the pro life vs pro choice debate to be about sex and I believe that my instinct on this is correct. Without abortion and more broadly speaking contraception sex is risky and serious and it \u201cmakes more sense\u201d to have it only in a serious relationship or marriage. \n\nIronically when modern contraception and elective abortion were introduced to public discourse it was believed that out of wedlock births would be drastically reduced however the opposite effect occurred. As the access to both facilitated more casual sex (sexual revolution) which lowered marriage rates overall. \n\nLastly if you look at the data on abortion it does seem to suggest that casual sex is a huge factor in abortion with unmarried pregnant women having an abortion rate that is nearly 10 times that of married women [per the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/ss/ss7209a1.htm)",

I said I think protecting access to casual sex is a bigger motive than is let on by the pro choice side just like discouraging casual sex is a bigger motive on the pro life side than is often let on. That doesn\u2019t mean every pro lifer is against casual sex or vice versa with pro choicers",

Conservatives like \"abstinence-only\" when it comes to sex ed, and they have been conditioned to dislike \"comprehensive.\"  I think the researchers just didn't predict that this would be a strong effect (and maybe it's not), which is weird because they did remove other trigger words and phrases from all 3 policy positions.\n\nWhat's really striking to me from their results, is that the most anti-abortion people actually on average favored the punishment policy more than the comprehensive policy. That to me is pretty clear that the author's conclusions or implied conclusion is true. If someone favors punishment more than prevention, they probably care a good deal about controlling other peoples' lives. Or they're just stupid. Or they're a sociopath. I'll go with the first option.",
