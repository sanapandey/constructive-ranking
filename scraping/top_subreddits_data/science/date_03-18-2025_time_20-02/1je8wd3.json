The study follows 2,329 midlife women who kept menstrual diaries and completed annual surveys from 1996 to 2005.",

The right pill can be the difference between a miserable Perimenopause experience, and one that's at least bearable.  \n\nMy personal anecdotal experience was that I had to try different progesterones until I found one that worked.  \n\nDesogestrel made me emotionally flat and completely eliminated my libido, along with reducing any pleasure from physical contact.  I was physically numb in my clitoris.  \n\nDrospirenone reversed those issues completely.  I am happy again and want to be physical (and can enjoy it).  \n\nLastly, the type and amount of estrogen in the pill varies and can also make a difference.  I found Nextstellis (new form of Estrogen) to control my constant bleeding more than Yaz or Yasmin (which had my preferred progesterone.)  Unfortunately, my periods are still incredibly heavy and painful.  \n\nShould the pill be an altogether wrong move, there are weaker forms of HRT like estradiol patches, gels/creams, progesterone in various forms, etc.  \n\nIf all else fails, a uterine ablation can be effective, which is my next step.",

The BC pill I am on now gave me uncontrollable insomnia and sleepiness at random times for the first 2 months I took it before settling down. (I have period hormone induced insomnia and the pill triggered it until my body got used to the new hormones)\n3. The negative side effects can be life altering. That makes it scary for most women who already lack control in this area. I personally know a woman who lost the ability to walk at the age of 32 because her BC gave her a stroke. I know another woman whose BC gave her near homicidal rage that went away as soon as she ended treatment.\n\n\n\nI think medicine that it based around feminine hormones is genuinely lacking on what it can do to the human body and as a result women are left behind.",
