Semaglutide reduced inflammation in the brains of genetically modified mice that mimic Alzheimer\u2019s disease and improved their memory performance.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:\n\nhttps://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(24)00604-3/abstract\n\nAbstract\n\nA growing number of studies show that the diabetes drug Semaglutide is neuroprotective in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) animal models, but its mode of action is not fully understood. In order to explore the mechanism of Semaglutide, 7-month-old APP/PS1/tau transgenic (3xTg) mice and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group (WT + PBS), AD model group (3xTg + PBS), Semaglutide control group (WT + Semaglutide) and Semaglutide treatment group (3xTg + Semaglutide). Semaglutide (25 nmol/kg) or PBS was administered intraperitoneally once every two days for 30 days, followed by behavioral and molecular experiments. The results show that Semaglutide can improve working memory and spatial reference memory of 3xTg-AD mice, promote the release of anti-inflammatory factors and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory factors in the cortex and hippocampus, and reduce A\u03b2 deposition in the hippocampal CA1 region of 3xTg mice. Semaglutide can inhibit the apoptosis of BV2 cells induced by A\u03b21-42 in a dose-dependent manner and promote the transformation of microglia from M1 to M2, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Therefore, we speculate that Semaglutide shows an anti-inflammatory effect by promoting the transformation of microglia from M1 to M2 type in the brain of 3xTg mice, and thus exerts a neuroprotective effect.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nA new study suggests that semaglutide, a drug commonly used to treat diabetes, may help protect the brain from the effects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Researchers found that semaglutide reduced inflammation in the brains of genetically modified mice that mimic Alzheimer\u2019s disease and improved their memory performance. The findings, published in the journal Neuroscience, add to growing evidence that diabetes medications may offer benefits for neurodegenerative diseases, though more research is needed to understand how these drugs exert their effects.\n\nThe results showed that semaglutide improved both short-term and long-term memory in the Alzheimer\u2019s model mice. In a test called the Y-maze, which measures spatial working memory, untreated Alzheimer\u2019s model mice performed significantly worse than normal mice. However, those treated with semaglutide showed improved memory performance, nearly matching the healthy control mice. Similarly, in the Morris water maze, a test that assesses long-term spatial memory, semaglutide-treated mice found the hidden platform more quickly than untreated Alzheimer\u2019s model mice.\n\nOn a biological level, semaglutide reduced the amount of amyloid plaque in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. The researchers also found that semaglutide lowered levels of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which are known to contribute to brain cell damage. At the same time, semaglutide increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, which help protect brain cells.\n\nOne of the key findings was that semaglutide appeared to change the behavior of microglia, the brain\u2019s immune cells. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, microglia become overly activated and release harmful inflammatory substances. Semaglutide encouraged microglia to shift from a pro-inflammatory state, known as the M1 type, to an anti-inflammatory state, known as the M2 type. This transformation is thought to reduce brain damage and promote healing.\n\nTo further investigate how semaglutide affects inflammation, the researchers conducted additional experiments using cultured microglial cells. When these cells were exposed to amyloid beta, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, they became inflamed and started releasing harmful substances. However, when the cells were pretreated with semaglutide, they produced fewer inflammatory molecules and were less likely to undergo cell death.",
