That treatment pathway was mostly abandoned when something like 90% of participants couldn't stand the feminizing side-effects. We don't use that for prostate cancer much anymore, and I seem to recall anecdotally (was it a forum post or a reddit post? I do not recall where I got this memory) that actually there are some trans women who accepted a hormonal transition after starting treatment for prostate cancer!\n\nAmanda Bynes on the set of \"she's the man\" had to play a crossdressing woman on set and describes something very similar to gender dysphoria on that set.

Even if there weren't, you'd have to ask. \n\nnow if you make the argument that people are asking so much in bad faith that other people no longer wish to explain that I will actually give you and agree with. I just don't see that as a problem that is caused by the people who don't want to explain for the 6, 000th time. And if the problem isn't with them it has to be with the people who are arguing in bad faith which seems to go unpunished a lot of the time when just BEING trans is punished much of the time. *The work and who it is falling on is uneven here.*\n\nNot only that but in an area that is focused on science I would think that the ability to think, 'if everyone says I'm wrong, I should go find out whether I actually am' is kind of a normal state of being for people who actually want to better themselves. \n\nPeople who have asked me questions about transness from a place of curiosity just don't fall under transphobe for me. So in the domain of just general conversation I am pretty open to explaining things to people and I do, regularly.\n\nAlso a lot of people are just done with this shit now. they tried to be the person you're describing for so long and we are still here. The time for caring whether or not you're right or wrong about your personal trans opinions as a non trans person is before the trans people all have to expend 100% our energy warning and protecting our own people.\n\nIt sounds like you're arguing that people should be doing more to coddle people who do not want to learn. And the people who are tired of trying to teach don't want to hear it.\n\nalso, it's exhausting to try and reach across the aisle for years and years as things get worse for you, and then when people are talking about putting everyone like you in camps, someone comes along and says \"why didn't you educate them harder?? why aren't you still trying to help those people understand you?\" Do you think that we don't hear that all the time? whenever we express any kind of resentment for the amount of work that we've put in and gotten seemingly no return on?",

I hope that as the entrenched people step down, more open-minded and accepting people will take their place.\n\nI understand that it's still going to be an uphill battle for you, so I wish you all the best.

We are the ones who decide what is and isn't bigoted towards us. If you are white you don't get to decide what racism looks like to a person of color. If you are a man you don't get to decide what sexism looks like to a woman. If you are cis you don't get to decide what transphobia looks like. Hope this helps. \n\nYou are in fact defending transphobia and only offering half hearted platitudes when it comes to trans rights. You need to be better than that \"centrist\"",

Untrained TEACHERS doing this en masse! \n\nIt's not *Teens*, it's ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN! They're CORRUPTING the INNOCENT younglings!\n\nIt's not *Suggesting they try a new pronoun*, it's TRANS SURGERIES. After all, it's a MIND VIRUS anyway and even SUGGESTING that they might be trans is JUST AS BAD as surgeries!\n\n\"Without informing the parents they had a conversation\" becomes \"WITHOUT OUR CONSENT\" which is intentionally cloaked in left-wing terminology, and is also a hell of a lot less scary when talking about advice rather than surgery. \n\n\n\nThe intent is to villianize the harmless normal thing as equivalent to the outrageous outlandish thing, because to some conservatives, the idea that their kid could have their gender dysphoria explained is equivalent to trans surgeries, but saying that makes them seem ridiculous and makes it hard to garner support for their position.\n\nAdditionally, the Ship of Theseus argument is convenient because they can call it a widespread issue, and when you call them out, they can probably find examples of some things. A teacher in some state that gave their student advice becomes \"All teachers\". A particularly obvious case of gender dysphoria is talked about by a guidance councelor in an elementary school somewhere in the country becomes \"This is happening EVERYWHERE in YOUR SCHOOLS\" \n\nKnow the bullshit so you can call out the bullshit.",

But the problem is that it can be very hard to tell if someone is genuinely ignorant or has genuine concerns vs people who are just transphobic and/or concern trolling, especially over the internet. Personally I try to avoid tone-policing trans people unless they're doing something extreme / harmful, such as sending death threats.",

Not Congress, not the church, not not some online troll. None of those people are dealing with the issue first hand, so none of them should have a say in how it gets treated.

Again - what a shocker. \n\nI know that's maybe overly pedantic but the amount of lying that trans people have to do to be awarded the diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" is staggering.  \n\nGender Dysphoria is real and treatable via medical intervention in all genders, just look at Elon Musk's hairline. \n\nBeing Trans is real and often leads to Gender Dysphoria that can be treated by medical intervention. \n\nBut the idea that Gender Dysphoria = Trans is *not* proved by this, or really anything else. \n\nIf, shall we say, \"cross-gender dysphoric symptoms\" are functionally different from BDD, which we currently assume to be the case, or from cisgender dysphoria, it needs more research because, at the moment, it's just taken as read. \n\nI'd argue *that whatever* the outcome, the best option is to provide Trans patients with affirmative care - it far and away seems to have the best results from a purely practical point of view.

I don\u2019t see why it would be surprising that blockers wouldn\u2019t provide the full alleviation of depression that full hormone treatment does, and I can very much understand the desire to not release a study that could be intentionally misconstrued in the current environment to imply blockers do not help, since a finding that they prevented depression from significantly worsening might have been accurate and true and prove value for blockers in a vacuum but could be used to attack blockers by those with malicious intent who would want to lie and claim they do nothing. \n\nSpeaking from my own experience with puberty blockers, while it sure as shit beat puberty continuing, it wasn\u2019t the *most* fun to get hot flashes during classes sometimes, so I would certainly have preferred earlier access to proper hormone treatment so I could go through puberty - the one that I could actually tolerate and desired, that is - alongside my peers, instead of having the *compromise* that is blockers. Because that\u2019s what blockers are, they\u2019re the compromise to buy time because some people aren\u2019t comfortable with teenagers making medical choices, they\u2019re not the solution. It\u2019s only natural that the time-buying compromise doesn\u2019t *fix* the problems - they helped my depression and dysphoria not worsen, but my dysphoria wasn\u2019t actually *helped* until I got proper gender affirming care via hormones",

Genuinely, that's the kind of thing we're facing as a community.\n\nThat's also the reason why there's so much pushback to adding something like what you're proposing here - because transphobes will continually use that to try and push bigotry and hatred. They'll keep trying to say that people who have different gender and sex markers on their identification should be forced into prisons according to their sex (and face a massively outsized risk of rape because of it - 70% compared to the usual 1.5%) in order to 'protect women' (despite trans women in women's prisons not committing rape at higher rates thatn cis women).\n\nSomething the trans community is extremely aware of, that a lot of people aren't, is that the transphobic talking points have already been disproven by statistics and history. They aren't based on logical reasoning, they're based on hatred.",

She will face a 70% chance of rape and a 100% chance of forced detransition (through denial of medication - which, at that stage, she needs because having no hormones in your body is catastrophic).\n\n\nThe cost of hormones is $4/day (for reference, the cost of housing an inmate is $100/day), so it's dirt cheap. Further, placing trans women in women's prisons does not increase the rate of rape for cis or trans women.\n\n\nNo amount of self-acceptance can remove the fact that police can sentence me to be raped and face zero consequences.

Trans women in this situation are sometimes made to dance, present, or masturbate at the correctional officers' discretion.[121] A 2017 study by the Sylvia Rivera Law Project found that 75% of trans women respondents in New York state prisons were victims of sexual violence by a correctional officer, with 32% being victimized by more than one CO, 27% of respondents being forced to perform oral sex for a CO.[124] \n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_people_in_prison)",

In addition, GAHT was associated with a lower risk of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms across 48 months of follow-up.\n\nMeaning  The findings of this study suggest that integrated GAHT with primary care and low-barrier GAHT access is associated with lower rates of mental health morbidity in TGD patients.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nTransgender people prescribed gender affirming hormones are at significantly lower risk of depression, a new study shows. The US researchers looked at nearly 3600 transgender and non-binary patients, finding that over fifteen percent had moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. After two years of followup, those who were prescribed hormones had a significantly lower risk of depressive symptoms. The researchers suggest that this happens because of the physiological changes caused by hormones, as well as reductions in gender dysphoria leading to better social functioning.",

This particular review was done years ago, so it's possible new research has come out that contradicts the above results, or even that the results have changed over time as the social context has changed in the US and Europe.\n\nUltimately, scientific research into a topic like this will never be perfect; we just have to recognize this and work with what we have.\n\n[](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)",

We could give subjects hormones reaffirming their biological sex and see an improvement, which would just show that the issue lies with hormones, psychical appearance and other attributes are what is causing this issue and not so much dysphoria.\n\nWhat comes first the depression or the dysphoria? It is rather hard to define where one would begin to do real medical science when all we go off of is a survey. Men on testosterone replacement feel much better typically than men with low T, but you can take biomarkers for all of that. \n\nSo just doing hormone therapy for really anyone who likely is hormonally imbalanced is probably a positive, the gender aspect at that point would be secondary, or superficial to the study.",

The mad scientist encouraged the well-meaning parents to raise him as a girl and even forced the twins to do sexual roleplays to train David to be a girl. They even put him on female hormones at puberty.\n\n>He insisted that he was a boy, felt he was a boy, and in his early teens his parents finally admitted that he had been born a boy and let him be himself again, gave him the correct male hormones, etc. (He still eventually killed himself, unfortunately.)\n\n>While this experiment is horrific and unethical, it's also a crystal clear demonstration that a child's gender identity CANNOT be imposed upon them and that children cannot be forced to be transgender.\n\n\n\nThis explanation was in response from somebody else also wondering the same unethical experiments.

Our best understanding is that our brains have a number of regions, such as the right inferior fronto-occipital tract (which connects the parietal and frontal brain areas that mediate own-body perception) that function as a \"body map\".  Our brains know what sensory feedback they should be receiving from our bodies and when our sensations differ from that, it's uncomfortable and distressing.  This is a common experience in *everyone,* eg, when you have a numb spot or something stuck to your body changing the way things feel.  In trans people, our sex traits differ from what our brain expects and it triggers the same discomfort/distress mechanism.\n\nIe, trans people all experience the same \"type\" of dysphoria when it comes to the physiological side of things.  The term \"dysphoria\" *also* refers to the psychological side with respect to how we're perceived and treated by society and those circumstances can differ but the underlying neurochemical/physiological side is the same.\n\nTo clarify further, the *effects* of testosterone are what cause the distress in a trans woman.  Whether I knew which hormones I had or what my levels were - and nearly a decade before I knew I was trans - my facial hair growing in was intensely uncomfortable, it just felt like it \"shouldn't be there\".  Having higher testosterone would have made it come in faster, that wouldn't resolve the feeling of it being wrong.  I could go through *every* trait testosterone caused with the same story, being given higher testosterone wouldn't have improved my happiness because *other* than those traits, I was a happy kid.  Testosterone would have accelerated that discomfort.",

I'm sure there's plenty of studies about the subject one way or the other.\n\nIf I had to guess, males with gender dysphoria would probably get worse because they need reassurance more than control and every part of their bodies that resembles male characteristics will make it worse.\n\nYou are not changing the semantics of what they see in the mirror. Unless you change the needs, which it would probably take a lot of hormones, time and external factors (assuming it's even plausible), then you are better off changing what they see in the mirror.\n\nWhen you see yourself in the mirror, you make a model of other minds who are seeing you back. If you are a man, you make a model of other people looking at you and thinking that you are tough or dangerous or powerful, or able to lead. That's how you feel good because your needs to being in control are being met by your self image.\n\nBut if you have gender dysphoria, then every time you see yourself in the mirror, you see the semantics of a man, solving the needs of a man when you actually need reassurance and social validation.\n\nThat's where the pain comes from, giving more hormones won't significantly change your needs but will make every part of your body more male and therefore make you have more gender dysphoria.",

E.g. antidepressants vs talk therapy vs combined antidepressant and talk therapy vs no measures. The exact choice of therapy after further study to pick what are considered to be the strongest or popular contenders. Treatment, patient information etc would be standardized for the purposes of the study.\n\nIn order to reach sufficient volume of patients and achieve sufficient statistical power as well as getting a more representative patient selection perform the study as a multi-center in multiple clinics across the country.\n\nThere would be exclusion criteria, e.g. patients who are already undergoing treatment. This would result in a shortcoming of the study either way as you\u2019d then get a group of patients that are not necessarily representative. Any excluded patients would have to be counted and described.\u00a0\n\nParticipants would be randomly selected into each group and each group would be described, as it\u2019s important to show that they are roughly equivalent.\u00a0\n\nStudy period could be 1-4 years, the longer the better of course. Tests with regular intervals.\n\nEndpoint could be results on a standardized questionnaire or examining mental well-beeing with secondary endpoints being suicide and hospitalization.\n\nParticipants who dicontinue would be counted and analyzed.\n\nResearchers could be blinded.\u00a0\n\nResults would br subject of statistical analysis.\n\n\u2026 Many many more points to consider of course and there are certainly other designs that could be considered.\u00a0",

As you will know systematic reviews are the highest form of evidence, and going by them, we don't know enough. More research is required, primarily for young people. \n\nAdults the treatment pathways are more established and the identity of the person is also established. The same can't be said for young people and this causes a massive problem for clinicians having to bear the risk of giving kids medications that have long term consequences in a group that often can't even consent for treatment themselves.\n\nThe threshold must be greater. The currently in process setting up of trials and services in the UK provide a great platform to do this, enrol every child accessing gender care services into research if they want to access medication and get the research from there.\n\nThis is an absolute ethical and legal minefield.

More high-quality evidence for psychosocial effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy is vital for ensuring health equity for transgender people.\n\nHave you read the research coming out on Trans folks for the last 20 years or so? I have. The biggest confounding issue has been controlling for actual hormone control. There is a plethora of evidence that says, a lot of trans people have a hard time managing their hormones without surgical intervention, and yet there are still studies that fail to control for patient hormone levels. When they do, the studies indicate that trans people are more inline with their cis counterparts, but since we're dealing with a small population anyway, those controls limit patient pools and thus have issues of their own. The problems are not about whether or not hormones work or effect the physical appearance of the body, or that transitioning works. It's that most studies fail to control for even that basic premise so results are frequently inconclusive. Just saying, \"The research is lacking\" is ignoring the very important context of the situation.",

We should take it into account but as we've now been shown time and time again... the things they say work, actually don't. The chemical imbalance theory was completely made up and SSRI's etc do way more harm than good. Sure they have a place for an individual that's struggling and can't function in the world but if put on drugs like that there should be an immediate plan to better that persons life and ween them off the SSRI's.\n\nThe human body has a homeostatis. Men and women (and each individual even further) have their own homeostasis. These treatments are actively fighting against that and people will pay the price down the line for that. The original comment was about kids and ice cream. We know it immediately makes kids happy but as parents we give them nutritional food instead because we understand the ramifications of only eating ice cream. These \"studies\" are just questionnaires that are akin to asking a kid if they enjoyed their ice cream.\n\nI want all trans people and people in general to cease suffering. I really really really do. I just honestly don't believe that ultimately these treatments are a good idea. I understand some people are claiming they are happier directly after surgery and/or hormone therapy. I've watched two people in my life personally go through with both and now both are far worse off then they were prior. It's a temporary high if anything at all.",

Therapy for those people could be beneficial, but there's no guarantee those people will change. You say objective truth, but you're not giving an indication of what that objective truth is. Is your idea of objective truth that people shouldn't be on any drugs regardless of whether or not it makes them happier?

It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",

Something doesn't have to be 100% settled and every detail known for its general causes to be well understood.  Sex incongruence, the source of the biological side of gender dysphoria, is something trans people are born with as a result of the process of the brain being sexed \"incorrectly\" during fetal neurological development.  While the ways the brain are sexed aren't fully understood and spread across a variety of brain regions, some, such as the right inferior fronto-occipital tract, have been identified as key regions associated with gender dysphoria as it relates to \"own-body perception\", ie, the brain's \"body map\" of what the body's physical sensations is \"supposed to be\".\n\n*In addition*, there are psychological elements - which seem to be primarily what you're commenting on - and those, of course, can be treated through therapy and social acceptance and *does* vary between individuals.  While the psychological elements of gender dysphoria can be treated with therapy, the *neurological* elements cannot, but physical interventions (therapy or GAHT) *do* treat those elements through aligning the physical body with the brain's map of what it's \"supposed\" to be.\n\nKeep in mind that trans people - myself included - are a real group of people.  We have insights into our own experiences *in addition* to having to keep abreast of new research because society has a tendency to dismiss our experiences *and us* as illegitimate without pausing to consider we're as intelligent and as capable of understanding and synthesizing research on the subject as anyone else.  But a critical difference is that many cis people misunderstand what it is we experience it and, in mischaracterizing it, misunderstand the research and the recommendations for treatment.",

One of them had lost his penis to a botched circumcision, so a mad scientist who thought that gender identity was 100% nurture decided to try to force him to be a girl, sincerely believing that the child would be happier as a girl than as a dickless boy (this is the time a toddler HAS been given gender reassignment surgery.) The mad scientist encouraged the well-meaning parents to raise him as a girl and even forced the twins to do sexual roleplays to train David to be a girl. They even put him on female hormones at puberty.\n\nHe insisted that he was a boy, felt he was a boy, and in his early teens his parents finally admitted that he had been born a boy and let him be himself again, gave him the correct *male* hormones, etc. (He still eventually killed himself, unfortunately.)\n\nWhile this experiment is horrific and unethical, it's also a crystal clear demonstration that a child's gender identity CANNOT be imposed upon them and that children cannot be forced to be transgender.\n\n(The only minor silver lining from a societal PoV is that David wasn't one of the ~1/200 people who are actually transgender-- while coincidentally having a female gender identity to begin with might have made the experience less traumatic, it would have also seemed to prove the mad scientist's theory correct and really fucked with our understanding of gender identity until we figured out what happened.)",

Unfortunately we don't know of any effective ways. It's easier to change the body - and without significant health risks. People taking these options are perfectly able to evaluate these risks (unlike in the picture of \"delusional\" people you're trying to paint).\n\nThe topic is very sensitive because of methods like conversion \"therapy\" (which of course would not need extremely high evidence, double blind studies, right?? Not in the current USA).\n\nBtw there is some research exploring differences between brain scans of cis&trans people, theories about brain development in the womb that could be a cause. It's interesting but at a very early stage: brains are complex enough when it comes to depression, but here the topic is also intertwined with culture, gender norms and people wanting to tell you what is \"normal\".",

You don't feel phantom pain in your hand and go, well if I just remove the hand it'll go away - for people who lost their limbs in war (or otherwise) and they still feel those parts; you can't just physically add a hand to relieve the pain. It's all psychological.\n\nTo argue your placebo - the issue here isn't growing boobs, it is feeling less depressed. Not giving HRT to someone and seeing if they improve their mental health - but suggesting you gave them HRT would be a benefit to this study. The IDEA that you are fixing yourself sometimes is enough to fix yourself.\n\nI would argue that the dysphoria here is the discomfort of reality. A miscommunication - or at the very least the unpleasant experience of the current communication between the mind and body. Everyone experiences this usually - very few people in this world look at themselves in the mirror and are like \"I'm perfect\". I would say a good percent of people probably are like \"I'm good enough\" and still a way too large percent of people look at themselves and go \"I'm not enough\" and a frighteningly high percent of people look at themselves and say \"I'm horrific\".\n\nThere are effective ways to challenge discomfort of a situation (which is what dysphoria is).\n\n1. Accept the situation and make the most of it. This is the core of Exposure therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Theory and how some people (not saying all people) handle most situations in life.\n\n2. Change the situation. This is what I would suggest is the \"get surgery and HRT\" option.\n\n3. Change your value hierarchy. Your sub-conscious is focus on this being a problem, and it is a problem to an extent; but is it the most important problem in your perspective but it isn't the most important problem that you have. Like chronic/phantom pain - you could just live life if you didn't have it; or at least that's what you tell yourself. You've convinced this is the answer, and everyone around you has also convinced you that this is the answer. You go through all hell and trials of tribulation to get it resolved, and suddenly you get it resolved and you find out that you've lost a huge purpose in life and you feel empty because you lost it. Why? Because life is about the pursuit of things, not actually acquiring the thing. The pursuit of happiness is more engaging and fulfilling than actual happiness - which is fleeting. That's why rich people who've accomplished everything feel empty.\n\nConversion therapy is a religious activity, not a psychological activity. That's why it is \"pray the gay away\" and not \"analyze your pass traumatic experiences and process them in a healthy way to get a better understanding of who you are as a person today as a result of the experiences of your life and perhaps weigh why certain experiences have driven different outcomes\".\n\nThe same could be said about transgender people. I'm not suggesting you pray the trans away - I'm suggesting that there appears to be (at least in the public eye) a large portion of these people who are just mentally unwell in general - not even depression. They appear to be delusional or unstable (and I don't mean the dysphoria); they freak out at people and just appear to be nuisances to society. Then there are the trans people that I know personally, who are chill, relaxed and level headed. So I definitely think the perspective of Trans people is that they are insane and delusional; and I think that there is a good chunk of them that are. But for the sane ones, that are level headed; I would say, yea do your transition; or yea, do a deeper dive. They would respond well to both answers.",

They've solved a problem and are not left with the tools to solve more problems.\nThe 2nd person will solve more problems - and in the long term be less depressed because they have the tools necessary to solve those problems.\n\nI suspect the first person will run into more problems in the future and not have the tools necessary to solve those problems - since not all problems can be solved with surgery or drugs (I guess it depends on what \"solved\" means, self-harm is the worst kind of solution).

Six cohorts were created based on gender and surgery status: Cohorts A-D included patients with or without surgery, and Cohorts E-F allowed for gender comparison among those with surgery. Propensity score matching controlled for age, race, and ethnicity. Mental health outcomes included depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, substance use disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder, assessed over two years post-surgery using clinician-verified ICD-10 codes. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) was analyzed separately and not conflated with gender dysphoria cohorts to ensure the distinction between these conditions. Statistical analysis employed risk ratios, with P < 0.05 deemed significant.\n\nResults\nFrom 107 583 patients, matched cohorts demonstrated that those undergoing surgery were at significantly higher risk for depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and substance use disorders than those without surgery. Males with surgery showed a higher prevalence of depression (25.4% vs. 11.5%, RR 2.203, P < 0.0001) and anxiety (12.8% vs. 2.6%, RR 4.882, P < 0.0001). Females exhibited similar trends, with elevated depression (22.9% vs. 14.6%, RR 1.563, P < 0.0001) and anxiety (10.5% vs. 7.1%, RR 1.478, P < 0.0001). Feminizing individuals demonstrated particularly high risk for depression (RR 1.783, P = 0.0298) and substance use disorders (RR 1.284, P < 0.0001).\n_\n\n\nThe higher risk was compared to non-surgically corrected people with gender dysmorhia.

I am simply quoting the actual study, which I read, which does not support the conclusion as much as it is implied in the comments.\n\nLet me quote the study again:\n\n>These findings should be interpreted alongside several limitations. This was a cohort from FQHCs that specialize in providing GAHT through an informed consent model. The association of GAHT with moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms may, therefore, be confounded by the gender-affirming context in which GAHT prescribing occurred (eg, trained clinicians, correct name and pronoun use). The TGD patients in this clinic-based cohort may be healthier than those not receiving care (ie, clinic patient bias). The cohort was relatively young and based in urban settings, which may impact the representativeness of the findings. Similarly, regarding generalizability, FQHCs serve safety net patient populations and have more comprehensive behavioral health services than non-FQHC practices; thus, TGD patients in this cohort may be more disenfranchised socioeconomically or have better access to behavioral health care than TGD patients in other primary care settings. Selection bias may also be a relevant limitation, since participants self-selected into GAHT; however, the nonrandomized design was ethically appropriate for the research question. The study did not assess the duration of GAHT or uptake of gender-affirming surgery; future research is needed to longitudinally explore these issues. The outcome variable was the PHQ screener for depression\u2014not a diagnostic tool. Furthermore, the PHQ-9 was used at one clinical site while the PHQ-2 was used at the other site, which could result in unmeasured site differences due to the use of different metrics. However, the PHQ is a practical and recommended screening tool routinely implemented in primary care settings that can identify patients who may need further clinical evaluation and mental health referrals.\n\nThey literally didn't even use the same assessment when reviewing depression across the candidates.

It's a safer and less permanent option compared to HRT. Of course for some people there can be side effects, such as bone density development, fertility development, and changes in height.

The difference between the two when controlled for all other factors seems to be about 15 percent.  Mind you, the major confounding factors is that:\n\nA: The ratio of people studied taking hormones vs not taking hormones was not even remotely close to being even. They studied 3000 people taking hormones and about 500 not taking them.  \nSaying that these 3000 people were 15 percent less likely to have depressive symptoms than these 500 people is not nearly as useful.\n\nHowever what really concerns me is the usage of two different sites which used different scales to determine depression.  One of the sites used PHQ-9 versus the other using PHQ-2. \n\nPHQ-2 should not have been used in this study, as admitted by the researchers. If the object is to evaluate depression, you cannot change the definition of depression across subjects.\n\nThe other confounding factors mentioned, possible sample bias from those receiving hormones as receiving a greater degree of medical  treatment in general also need to be considered, but in my opinion are slightly less relevant and don\u2019t really invalidate the study.\n\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say the study is marginally interesting, with enough there to explore in follow up studies as noted by the researchers.  By itself I wouldn\u2019t put too much into this as the correlation is statistically significant but too weak, and the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 issue is too big to ignore.",
