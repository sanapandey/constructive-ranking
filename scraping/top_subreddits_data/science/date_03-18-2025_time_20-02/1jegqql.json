In contrast, higher WHR in midlife was associated with poorer working memory and executive function, through a pathway partially mediated by alterations in white matter connectivity.\n\n[Paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/articlepdf/2831324/jensen_2025_oi_250018_1741195266.36189.pdf)",
