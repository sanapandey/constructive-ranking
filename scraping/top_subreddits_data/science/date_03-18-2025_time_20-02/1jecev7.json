People could stand on it and float around because their feet were almost always a bit off the ground. Mark Twain stopped by one day and Tesla showed it to him. Twain was very excited to try it and ignored Tesla's warning not to use it for too long. Twain's fun was cut short when he wound up shiting himself from the laxative effects of the vibration. I don't know if that counts as brown noise, but I've always enjoyed the story.",

In one experiment, communication of the words from one to ten using \u00b4speech modulated\u00b4 microwave energy was successfully demonstrated. Microphones next to the person experiencing the voice could not pick up these sounds. Additional development of this would open up a wide range of possibilities.\"\n\n\nOr the targeted microwaves to heat your body up, coming from an advert showing ice creams on sale :)",

Think of it like a straight line, where anyone hit by that line can hear it. This means that as long as you are aiming it at your target, they can move closer or further away and still be hit. \n\nBut the technology in the above article refers to the use of two combined soundwaves that have a very specific spot of overlap. At that specific point, it can be detected. If the subject moves closer or further away, they can drift out of that precise spot even if you are aiming at them directionally. \n\nSo maintaining a specific zone where the subject continuously hears you is challenging. Any sudden movements could move them out of that sweet spot, as well as any surrounding interference that could impact one or both of the soundwaves",

High freq signals have smaller beam widths than low freq so it can cause a vary narrow beam source compared to sources trying to make the difference freq traditionally. Its super inefficient as it requires non linearity so you have to drive your source super hard to have it create the difference signal with any amplitude of significance.\n\nThe bending waves through space is kind of crap though, they use metamaterials behind the observer that changes sound speed causing the waves to bend this causes the location of the two signals meet to be right in front of the observer so you need that metamaterial to get the encoded freq to the observer you want. \nAlso original signals still have some directivity so while people cant hear them they can be relatively easily sensed so use in sensitive applications make this unrealistic. \n\nTruthfully there isnt much novel here as metamaterials have done stuff like this for 15 years and parametric arrays are like 60 years old.

We have also had parametric array speakers for awhile, which make sound travel in a beam. When i was in college a friend of mine and i went out in a field with one and talked to each other from across the field. If the speaker wasn't pointed directly at you, you couldn't hear the sound.\n\nIt looks like they just use 2 parametric array speakers with sound frequencies that are \"inaudible\" to humans, so that the waves interfere into one that is audible. I have inaudible in quotes because I can hear around 20kHz and those ultrasonic machines that repel bats really annoy me. I feel like this device would give me a headache.\n\nI think it might make a cool experience if this tech were precise enough to target an individuals ear, so that if you go to the movies you could create sound as if the person was wearing a headset to simulate direction. I don't have that much faith in it though, because when we were using the parametric array speakers, the sound peaks in the center of the directional beam, and gets quieter as you move towards the edges. The beam was pretty large (probably like 10-20 feet), but that may have just been from our distance from the speaker.\n\nIt will be neat to see what people come up with though. I love acoustics.",

You can generally direct sound to some extent, like a megaphone, but it doesn't work like a laser. That means the field in front of the ultrasonic speakers would be full of nodes where the sounds interact to generate the audible point, but as you move around the room, there will be many such points and the sound would fade in and out as you move through the room.\n\nBack in the analog tape days, we used to lay down tones to calibrate the tape decks in the recording studios. The 15k tone was painful for me, but I could aways move my head a few inches and find a wave cancellation where the sound dropped out at that point in space.. Keep moving and the sound came back, but then another dead spot would be a few inches away. This would be the same, but with audible nodes all over the room.",
