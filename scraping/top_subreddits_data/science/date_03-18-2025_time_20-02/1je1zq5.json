            "body": "From the article: Using advanced analysis based on full genome sequences, researchers from the University of Cambridge have found evidence that modern humans are the result of a genetic mixing event between two ancient populations that diverged around 1.5 million years ago. About 300,000 years ago, these groups came back together, with one group contributing 80% of the genetic makeup of modern humans and the other contributing 20%.\n\nFor the last two decades, the prevailing view in human evolutionary genetics has been that Homo sapiens first appeared in Africa around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, and descended from a single lineage. However, these [latest results](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02117-1), reported in the journal Nature Genetics, suggest a more complex story.\n\n\u201cThe question of where we come from is one that has fascinated humans for centuries,\u201d said first author Dr Trevor Cousins from Cambridge\u2019s Department of Genetics. \u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been assumed that we evolved from a single continuous ancestral lineage, but the exact details of our origins are uncertain.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur research shows clear signs that our evolutionary origins are more complex, involving different groups that developed separately for more than a million years, then came back to form the modern human species,\u201d said co-author Professor Richard Durbin, also from the Department of Genetics.\n\nWhile earlier research has already shown that Neanderthals and Denisovans \u2013 two now-extinct human relatives \u2013 interbred with Homo sapiens around 50,000 years ago, this new research suggests that long before those interactions \u2013 around 300,000 years ago \u2013 a much more substantial genetic mixing took place. Unlike Neanderthal DNA, which makes up roughly 2% of the genome of non-African modern humans, this ancient mixing event contributed as much as 10 times that amount and is found in all modern humans.",

Their model might be new, but the conclusions are very similar to the Ragsdale 2023 paper, quoted as reference 16 in this paper.\n\nFor example, compare their diagram 6 \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02117-1/figures/6\nwith Ragdsale\u2019s figure 3\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10208968_41586_2023_6055_Fig3_HTML.jpg\n\nOne of the big advantages of Ragsdale\u2019s model is that it allows for continuous flow between branches, as opposed to big bang events",
