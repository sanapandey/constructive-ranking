In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300571224007048\n\nHighlights\n\n\n- Cannabidiol shows promise in enhancing biomineralization, which is important for dental tissue regeneration.\n\n- Cannabidiol plays a significant role in regulating immune responses, potentially improving healing outcomes in dental procedures.\n\n- Cannabidiol is a compelling candidate for innovative dental therapies aimed at both reparative and preventive care.\n\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nStudy shows that cannabidiol may be a promising agent for promoting dental biomineralization\n\nResearchers tested different concentrations of the substance on dental pulp cells. Results show promise for dental tissue repair.\n\n In vitro tests indicate that cannabidiol can stimulate the biomineralization of teeth even under inflammatory conditions, thus promoting tissue repair.\n\nThe results showed that treatment with cannabidiol was able to inhibit the synthesis of inflammatory mediators, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect, especially after 24 hours. In addition, the substance stimulated the capacity for tooth biomineralization.\n\n\u201cThese findings indicate that cannabidiol may be a promising bioactive substance for tissue repair in inflammatory contexts, which opens up new perspectives for its use in dental treatments, especially in regenerative dentistry, benefiting patients in different clinical situations,\u201d says Paula-Silva.",
