One 12-3-30 workout sesh can burn anywhere between 300 and 800 cals, to be specific. But the exact number will vary depending on your current weight since it takes more energy expenditure to move more mass, says personal trainer and fitness coach Claudette Sariya, CPT.  - https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a44176037/12-3-30-treadmill-workout/\n\nLike all exercise-related activities you can\u2019t do just ONE thing and have it fix all your problems. You should also do 2-3 resistance workouts and 1-2 high-intensity workouts per week on top of this baseline cardio work for optimal health and injury prevention.",

Push forward (push-up motion)\n2. Pull backwards (row)\n3. Push upwards (overhead press)\n4. Pull downwards (pull-up) \n5. Squat \n6. Hip Hinge (dead lift)\n\nThere's LOTs of exercises that can do each of those motions, and if you have personal things or vanities to address, you can add those to this list; but it's a good start.\n\nThe gold standard is 3-5 sets of 10-12 reps for each of those motions. But if you're short on time even a single set can move you forward. And some days it's fun to see how hard you can do something, so even 4-6 really hard reps can count.\n\nThere's no 1 way, and as long as you're pushing your muscles towards the limits in a safe and controlled manner you're going to get stronger.\n\n**Interval workouts**\n\nThese suck. They're just the worst. I hate them. BUT...they're one of the more important workouts you can do. The real goal here is you need to make sure you're getting your heart up to its absolute max rate for 5-15 min. The reality though is nobody can go 100% for 5-15min straight though, so typically you'll see these called \"HIIT\" workouts (High-Intensity Interval Training, where go at like 80-100% for a set amount of time, take a tiny break, then go back to the hard stuff for a certain number of repeats.\n\nSome common workouts you'll see are things like the Tabata, Nordic 4x4 (4 min on, 2-4 min off; repeated 4 times), or my personal favorite HIDIT. I find these are typically easiest to do as a running/track workout, on an exercise bike, or maybe a local hill that you've timed out.\n\nBasically if you hate your life. If somebody even trying to talk to you makes you angry. If you'd rather do anything else in life in that moment. Then you're probably doing it right.\n\nWhile they suck. Everybody needs to do these because the good they do for your body is incredible. HUGE adaptive changes. It really blows out your arteries which helps fight various diseases like heart disease, dementia, and literally, not making this up; the shear forces of your blood pumping so hard is also good at ripping apart cancer cells in your blood so you're less likely to get cancer and if you have cancer it's less likely to metastasize. Incredible stuff.\n\nBut don't do more than 1-2 per week or you'll be too tired to recover properly.\n\n  \nIt sounds like a lot, but basically if we want to be healthy we need to do something every day with the occasional rest day. Building a good cardio base (like with the 12-3-30), maintaining or growing your strength (resistance), and really challenging your body (Intervals) are going to keep you moving forward and well for years and years to come.",

Brain function is directly linked to cardiovascular health, because the brain doesn\u2019t have lymphatic drainage to clear waste.** Efficient blood circulation is the only way to get waste products out of the brain. \n\n1. **There is no cheating exercise.** We know about diet and lack of sleep clogging the pipes, but let\u2019s assume that\u2019s controlled for. People have to do painful things frequently to stay alive, that will never go away. \n\n2. **\u201dExercise\u201d = Number of minutes body does *work* with elevated heart rate.**\n\n3. **\u201dWork\u201d = physics definition of \u201cwork\u201d = the act of transferring energy to or from an object by exerting a force on the object, causing it to move a certain distance.** Lifting weights, running, calisthenics, etc. can all be boiled down to the act of transferring large amounts of energy from our bodies to closed physical systems. \n______________________________________________\n#There is no escape from this reality. \n\nOur bodies have adapted over millions of years to perform \u201cwork\u201d on our environments day in and day out. \n\nThe key is that the \u201cwork\u201d only counts for the duration of time the person\u2019s heart is elevated from the person\u2019s resting heart rate, or the amount of time the HR crosses the person\u2019s \u201czone 2\u201d threshold. \n\nWhy do you think it\u2019s called a \u201cwork-out\u201d\u2026? **You are quite literally letting \u201cwork\u201d transfer energy, \u201cout\u201d of the closed system that is your body, \u201cin\u201d to a closed system that is a barbell or the surface you run on.**\n______________________________________________\n\n**I am passionate about this because marketing strategies + comfort/convenience as our civilizational status quo\u2026**\n\nit all leads people to think GLP-1 or certain diets can make up for the lack of exercise the body needs to stimulate it\u2019s own growth/transformation process. \n\n**On a neurophysiological (function of brain) level, your muscle memory is much less articulated if you\u2019ve never done much physical activity in your life.** This makes it hard to incorporate new patterns of bodily motion in your repertoire if you have lived in a way to avoid moving your body at all costs. \n\nChoosing to not exercise for years at a time quite literally makes it **much harder, if not impossible,** to re-encode or update your body\u2019s dictionary of physical movements. This ranges from common exercise motions, to learning instruments, language, cooking, writing, etc. \n______________________________________________\n\nAll human skills and behaviors boil down to motor action patterns chained on top of existing motor action patterns. This theory of development via maintaining a repertoire of skills is called [constructivism](https://www.buffalo.edu/catt/teach/develop/theory/constructivism.html). \n\nHere, I have chosen to abstract this theory to apply to all motor movements in the body. **Remember all human skills require physical motion to be practiced, even things like thinking or mathematics.** At some point everything has to get written down or typed, your brain remembers \u201cmath\u201d as a series of bodily motions that move a problem from state A to state B. \n\nChildren build up a default repertoire of bodily motions that can be further expanded upon when learning new skills. **We can apply the \u201cskill tree\u201d analogy here.** The trunk of the tree is the gross motor action like \u201cclose hand\u201d. The branches of the skill trees are the fine motor skills like \u201cwriting.\u201d The skill \u201cwrite cursive\u201d is even more specific of a motor action, compared to \u201cwriting\u201d because you add more levels of abstraction to define the behaviors associated with the skill. \n\nGenerally skills have to be built off an existing trunk line that represents a low-resolution gross motor action. **Exercise is an activity where people train gross motor movements repeatedly for each set of limbs.** Training the trunkline movements really helps strengthen the capacity to encode more high-resolution fine motor movement which translates to skill.\n\nAfter enough time, the new fine motor movements get committed to muscle memory, chained off of old gross motor movements you mastered as a baby. **Think of the precision needed when trying to put the square peg in the square hole.** This task is one of the first hurdles that Robotics teams had to solve early in development of their machines. \n\nA skill becomes muscle memory when the skill becomes subconscious, and you don\u2019t have to think\u2026 like playing an instrument or speaking a language. **Your body instinctively performs the motor patterns so your ability to think can now be used to become fluent  and improvisational with the skill.**\n______________________________________________\n\n#So if you like a well-articulated muscle memory, and having an efficient brain, then you should use it to exercise. The benefits are so broad and deep they can\u2019t be expressed properly on Reddit.",
