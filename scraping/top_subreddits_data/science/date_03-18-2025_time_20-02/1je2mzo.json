Yet, we have an incomplete understanding of what is perceived as stressful by the developing brain, what aspects of stress influence brain maturation, what developmental ages are particularly vulnerable to stress, which molecules mediate the effects of stress on brain operations, and how transient stressful experiences can lead to enduring emotional and cognitive dysfunctions. Here, we discuss these themes, highlight the challenges and progress in resolving them, and propose new concepts and avenues for future research.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEarly-life stress affects a majority of the world\u2019s children and is a strong risk factor for cognitive and mental health problems later in life. Although early-life stress (or adversity) has been the focus of a multitude of studies in humans and experimental models, many questions about early-life stress and its influence on adult outcomes are not fully answered. This review will discuss the questions of what is perceived as stressful by the developing brain, what aspects of stress influence brain maturation, what developmental ages are particularly vulnerable to stress, which molecules mediate the effects of stress on brain operations, and how transient stressful experiences can lead to enduring emotional and cognitive dysfunctions. We will review evidence from human and experimental animal studies documenting newly recognized types of early-life stress and the complex impact of such stress on brain operations. Finally, we will highlight challenges and progress in the field and propose new conceptualization of early-life stress and avenues for future research.\n\n[https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00134-5](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00134-5)",

If it wasn't from negative social interactions due to my AuDHD or my crazy family, it was from getting sick and probably nearly dying a few times without medical intervention. I developed chronic anxiety and depression very early. I simply cannot separate my childhood experiences from who I am as an adult. Many people had worse, but I was always sensitive enough that someone angrily yelling at me felt like physical blows. I never could \"just get over it\". It has absolutely shaped me for better or worse.",
