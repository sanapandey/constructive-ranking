In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12328\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nDemocracies boost women\u2019s participation in the labor market\n\nUCR study finds that freer societies compel more women to pursue careers\n\nThe benefits of democratic societies go beyond greater personal freedoms and liberties. A new study by a UC Riverside economics professor has found that democratic systems of government also lead to higher participation by women in the labor market.\n\nBy examining world labor and political data spanning back to the 19th century, UC Riverside Associate Professor Ugo Antonio Troiano found that women who lived in democracies during their adolescence years were more like to join the workforce than women who had lived under autocracies or dictatorships. \n\n\u201cThe more democratic a country was when a woman was 18, the more likely she would join the labor force,\u201d Troiano said. \n\nStatistically, Troiano found that for every standard deviation increase (a uniform measure of how far a value moves from the average) in a country\u2019s democracy score during a woman\u2019s adolescence, her likelihood of joining the workforce increased by at least 2.6%.\n\nTo understand this phenomenon, Troiano found evidence that democratic rule reduces discriminatory attitudes toward women in the workplace.\n\nThe study also suggests that democracies create more female role models, further encouraging women to enter the labor force.\n\nTroiano said his findings align with what we know from political economy and development economics: people are inspired by leaders who resemble them. If all political figures are men, young boys are more likely to aspire to leadership positions, while girls are not. Democracies help correct such imbalances.\n\n\u201cThe role model hypothesis suggests that when young women see other women in professional roles during their impressionable years, they are more likely to pursue careers themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cMale dictators may serve as role models only for boys, while female politicians, who are more common in democracies, are more likely to inspire girls as well.\u201d\n\nHistorical data supports this idea. Over the past 50 years, democracies have had significantly higher rates of female political representation than autocratic regimes. Meanwhile, nearly 99% of all dictators in history have been male.",

Former Soviet block countries have higher women participation even if they aren\u2019t democratic. Belarus and Russia came to mind. But also true for Poland and Baltic states. \n\n2. Free societies tend to have a larger gap between women in STEM vs humanities compared to less free. Indicating when free to do as they will many will choose what they like, not what they can. \n\n3. Women are over represented among the Working poor in free countries and over represented among professional work in less free societies as compared to the overall population of the country. This is likely indicative of gender roles, but it does also mean that those who can achieve despite gender roles are more likely to highly achieve.",

The title really should say \"is associated with\" or \"results in\" (depending on how strongly the author wants to present the study).\n\nI can't access the original to confirm, but the article's initial claim is that more democratic societies are associated with higher participation of women in the workplace.  It then goes on to explain why that might be (female role models, less discrimination), using data.  Nothing about being forced to work.",

The way my wife explained it feels a little different. I'm gonna attempt to summarize:\n\nIt was never going to be \"equality\" for women. The was of American life in the 50s and 60s, women would never have the same rights or social access as a white man. So what do we do if everyone is still pushing for equality? Well, we lower everyone down a peg. Women can be equal to working class men, but to ensure this doesn't upset the status quo, the value assigned to the average working man has to be reduced. Now, whether this was done intentionally or whether it was a result of globalization and inflation and corporate greed is arguable, but the end result is the same: in the US, a working class couple with dual incomes is LESS wealthy than in indivual worker or similar status from 60 years ago. \n\nThere's more nuance here, but my point is that there is a sound theory here and there are sociologists who agree.",
