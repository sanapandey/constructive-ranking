You get your brain hooked on the \"Aha!\" moment and then get that idea reinforced every time you engage in argument about the topic and you have created a zealot. Religion operates the exact same way. You can't talk a religious person out of their beliefs because the act of defending their religion reinforces their original opinions. \n\nA mind virus gets stronger every time it's challenged. Add to that addictive reward pathways and the person will work harder every time to get that high. This is happening everywhere.

Their findings, published in the Journal of Health Psychology, indicate that individuals with poorer sleep quality over the past month were more likely to endorse conspiracy theories, particularly after exposure to conspiratorial content.\n\nConspiracy theories claim that powerful, secretive groups act in their own self-interest, to the detriment of society. These beliefs can have serious consequences, such as increasing vaccine hesitancy, climate change scepticism, and political distrust.\n\nIn their first study, 540 participants completed a standardised sleep quality assessment before reading an article about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire in Paris. Some were exposed to a conspiracy narrative suggesting a deliberate cover-up, while others read a factual account attributing the fire to an accident. The researchers found that those with poorer sleep quality were more likely to believe the conspiratorial version of events.\n\nA second study with 575 participants expanded on these findings by investigating the underlying psychological mechanisms that explain the link between poor sleep quality and conspiracy beliefs. The results showed that both poor sleep quality and insomnia were positively linked to the endorsement of conspiracy theories, with depression emerging as a mechanism. Anger and paranoia also played a role, but their effects were less consistent.\n\n  \n[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13591053251320598](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13591053251320598)",

Like there seems to be a correlation between people who bring up detoxing and water fluoridation and raw meat diets. The most conspiratorical people I know are definitely health nuts. Meanwhile the more melancholic friends tend to be more grounded in reality. This might very well be a selection bias on my part though, extroverted people not trying to hide their crazy as much.",

I've got a 6mo old at home and haven't had a proper sleep in weeks. Apparently, according to these 'experts' I'm just depressed and anxious <insert face-palm emoji that this subreddit forbids>",
