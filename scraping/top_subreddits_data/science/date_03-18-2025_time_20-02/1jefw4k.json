                    "body": "\u00ab One of the cool things about natural muscle tissues is, they don\u2019t just point in one direction. Take for instance, the circular musculature in our iris and around our trachea. And even within our arms and legs, muscle cells don\u2019t point straight, but at an angle. Natural muscle has multiple orientations in the tissue, but we haven\u2019t been able to replicate that in our engineered muscles. \u00bb",

Long distance travel and hiking is about to be more fun if they insert AI to converse with. \n\nFit them with defenses and parents can send their young kids to school without fear. \n\nHave them accompany animals like Elephants to rip some poachers into shreds. \n\nFake moms and dads for those with parental issues like in The Umbrella academy.  \n\nPossibilities are endless.\n\n\nSex robots with perfect bodily proportions.
