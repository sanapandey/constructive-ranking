    "selftext": "l inherited my grandmothers house in 2015. When she passed away, her death certificate was sent to the County and the house was put into my name. I began paying a mortgage on the house thereafter. I refinanced the house in 2022, with no issues. In February of this year, I received a letter in the mail from the County stating that I owed them 18,000 in back taxes. I was confused because there is an escrow account on my mortgage. The bank paid it, then told me that I was paying a discounted rate from 2021 through 2024 and that my mortgage will go from 1080 to 3100 per month until it's paid off!!! The new payment starts in May they said. That will crush me. Do I hire an attorney, look to sale it or where do you go from here? ",

If your house is worth 350k, you only pay property taxes on 300k.\n\nAdditionally, there's discounts for paying early.  Property taxes aren't due until March, but if you pay in November, it's 4% off what you owe, December 3%, January 2%, February 1%.\n\nI don't have escrow (had them cancel it, HATED relying on the bank's fucking algorithm or formula or some shit), but of course I pay it right away in November. :)",

Question the bank on this issue.  If they failed, they should work with you to make up the deficit over time....it was their fault.  Also, check with your local Treasurer to know for sure what your tax amount and your insurance carrier for your Home Insurance amount.  Both of these go into escrow.  Knowing these amounts are needed for the bank to estimate escrow each year, as it will change as your payments increase/decrease.\n\n  \nOnce you know your amounts and what the bank says caused the shortage if that is the cause.  If the bank has an ARM loan (adjustable rate mortgage) and the increase is due to an interest rate change then you should not owe anything in arrears as long as you made your payments they calculated.   I do not understand how the bank can say you had a discounted rate from 2024 when you refi'd the home in 2024?????  \n\nIf you do not get acceptable answers, hire a good attorney that deals with realestate.   If the problem is an ARM, refi again into a new LONG TERM LOAN with a fixed rate.  If you enough equity in the home you might be able to secure a loan large enough to ensure all past due figures are also paid off in the process.\n\n  \nHope this helos",

Assuming a pretty standard 1% property tax rate, I'm betting the value went up $242,000 when the county re-accessed it when the title transferred.     So, you inherited $242,000, good for you.     If you owe $18,000 that means you haven't been paying the taxes you should have been for a little less than a year.  \n\nIf you sell, you'll get $242,000-18,000 plus any other equity   which will buy you a nice van down by the river.   \n\nCounty website might let you look up the old valuation vs. the new, and this could explain and confirm my guess that the value went up $242,000, but that's been happening to places since 2021, so it seems likely.\n\nMy valuation has doubled since 2012,  and for that my taxes have increased my payment 20%, 10% just in the last couple years.   It's been happening to everyone.   People who own houses are so happy to see their valuations rise, but it is not actually good for them, their rent will go up for it one way or another.\n\nEven if you paid off the mortgage, your rent will still be $2020/month.   Unless the bank is offering you some sort of payment plan on the back escrow, although I've never seen that.  More usual they just divide the back into 12 and start charging you that.     That could explain the $2020 rise. \n\nMy county charges 10% interest on back taxes.    If you can't otherwise come up with the $18,000   you might be able to pay your taxes yourself without using the escrow, if your bank/mortgage will allow that.    They might be reticent to do that, they don't want the house to be taken as tax forfeit, which is why they offer that escrow service.\n\nYou could give a lawyer a few thou, but I'm not sure that will change the reality of the situation.  County has their own lawyers on staff, that countered a lot of the arguments you could make up front.      When the county re-accesses your taxes, they send you a notice for you to appeal.   Not sure what the time limit is on that, you might want to check that vs. how much time has passed.    You don't need a lawyer to appeal those taxes, but you do need to know your local laws etc. and find some ground to stand on.   \n\nI see you might be in Texas.    Because Texas doesn't have a state income tax, they fund their schools and stuff with property taxes, and for that have higher property tax rates, so my \"1%\" assumption is likely low depending on what county you're in.      That's the down side of \"no income tax\"   It goes to property tax, which you may or may not be able to afford since it is a fixed value and not a percentage of your income.    It makes you more sensitive to valuation increases.    It also means my estimate of your $242k windfall might be more like $120k-$160k",

They don't really know what your taxes are supposed to be either.\n\nI was prepared for it, at least, by my realtor.",

If you hadn't been paying that the last 9 years since 2015 or so when you got it, that could explain the $18k bill.  \n\nGetting an equity loan for that $18k would work, but that's going to be $500/month on top of the $200 or more per month in additional taxes you incurred since 2022.      Which might be less than $2000/month, just know where your taxes etc. are actually to know if it is sustainable or not.\n\nMy county has a property tax lookup website, you can look up any property's taxes by address for the last 5 years there.  Or, the county sends me a valuation every year.      You need more knowledge of details.  What is your property tax?   What was your property tax?  In 2015 when you got it?  In 2022 when you refinanced?    Who has been paying that?  What have they been paying?   If there were taxes owed in 2022, how did that get missed when you closed on the refinance?  Or are the back taxes since 2022?\n\nIf the bank did their due diligence in 2022 during the refi,  and the  taxes are since 2022,  how much are the new taxes, and how much payment on the equity loan are you going to be able to afford when also paying the higher taxes going forward?   e.g. if that is 30 months of underpaying your taxes $600/month, then you're going to have to pay $600/month more in taxes going forward without the back taxes,  and $18k of back taxes on a 5 year 9% loan is going to be another $400/month, you're looking at $1000/month.\n\nMy house went up near $130k since 2022, without issues of estate, refinancing, escrow or anything like that.      Yay, I'm rich.  Nope.  If I sold it, I'd have to either pay higher rent, or buy another house that also went up $130k.   It just means I'm paying more taxes.   Even though I \"own\" my house, my rent still went up like everyone else's.",
