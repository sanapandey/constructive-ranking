    "selftext": "I owe ~$4k in federal tax for 2024. I only ever had +/- $100 owed/returned for federal so this is big news to me. \n\nI determined that its my annual bonus causing the issue. The bonus is taxed at a flat rate, lower than my tax rate, so I owe that difference. \n\n2022 tax year and prior this wasn't an issue as I wasn't close to the next tax bracket but then I changed jobs halfway through 2023 which increased my salary and bonus amount. I ended up overpaying SS/Medicare for 2023 so the return from that evened out being undertaxed on the bonus (I owed ~$100 federal in total)... so I didn't notice this was a thing to fix.\n\nThis 2024 tax year I realized the issue. Going forward, I expect to owe federally every year because of the bonus. I've spoken to payroll and they can't increase withholding on the bonus payout so my only option is to either withhold additionally each paycheck to break even at tax time or pay a lump sum back to the IRS each return. How do others in similar situations manage this? Do you withhold additionally each paycheck or do you make a lump sum IRS payment at tax time? \n\nEven though the bonus is a contractually guaranteed payout each year (100% performance-based), I don't like relying on/using that money to pay bills/save; I treat it as truly extra, unplanned money. If I do additional withholding each paycheck (salaried) to account for the bonus taxes, it brings down my net pay that I do rely on to plan bill payments/savings. I then sort of become dependent on receiving a bonus, right? However unlikely, what if one year the bonus is eliminated or greatly reduced? Then I will have front-loaded money all year for nothing (except a free loan to the government) and would need to wait for a return. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards the lump sum payment each year as this would keep salary and bonus completely separate. I receive the bonus in May and can put the expected part to be owed (~$4k) in a separate HYSA to earn interest until I have to pay it back to the government on April 15. \n\nDoes that make sense? Is there anything I'm missing?",

Then when you do your taxes for that year, you'll be close to parity, and won't risk penalties, and if you don't get the bonus, you don't make the payment, solving the budgeting issue.",
