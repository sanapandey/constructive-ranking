    "selftext": "The credit union we have our auto loan through recently got bought out by another company, and over the course of the last few months have been notifying us of the next steps, login information, and resources to aid with the transition to the new company. The transfer of accounts and use of the new system went into full effect March 1st. When we log in to view our accounts with the new system, they show all the same accounts that existed with the previous company; mainly an unused savings account, checking account, and credit card with $0 balance. The only active account we regularly used was for an auto loan we took for my truck about 2.5 years ago. \nLast night, we got a letter addressed from the previous credit union. Inside it was the title to my truck, and a letter stating \u201cCongratulations on paying off your auto loan!\u201d There is no lien indicated on the title, and the back has the transfer to me from the credit union stating it\u2019s been paid in full and owned by me. \nI don\u2019t know what to do now. Part of me says \u201cYes! No more payments!\u201d. But another part of me is saying to do the brutally honest thing and send the title to the new credit union and keep paying on my loan. \nOther possibly relevant information\u2026\nThe entire loan amount was for about $16k, and I only owed about $7k before the transfer/buyout. Both the old and new credit union are out of state from us out west. We now live in Texas.  \nAny advice would be most welcomed. Thank you!\n\nEdit: This was all great advice and appreciate the input! I think this falls into the category of an unsecured loan now and will still make the payments like normal to avoid any hassle or hit to my credit. Just not going to tell them I have the title. ",

Your loan is now an unsecured loan. \n\nI",

If you try walking away from this debt, I'd assume the new credit union would still claim a lien on your vehicle even though it would be more difficult to enforce.\n\nSo for all intents and purposes, it's the same. \n\nIt was just easier for them, given the size of your loan and the number of loans they assumed in the acquisition, to roll your individual risk profile into the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio.",
