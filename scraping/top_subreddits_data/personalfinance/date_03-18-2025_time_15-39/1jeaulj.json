    "selftext": "Quick run down- I have been self employed for 7 years.  2 years ago I started a small contracting business for fiber optics.  Made GREAT money up until about 2 months ago.  Went 6 weeks without income and now the new company I sub for doesn\u2019t have the work we are used to doing.\n\n  I let go two of my guys (one was going to be let go regardless of work).  I now have one employee and work with him to save money.\n\n  My personal expenses are $800/month in rent, $100 in internet, $200-$300 in power, no credit cards, $25/month in student loans (almost paid off), my personal truck needed major repairs so being an idiot I traded it for a new truck with a million mile warranty $970/month and $262 for insurance (upside down almost $11,000).  And lastly I pay for my wife\u2019s school which is $640/month and about $200/month in gas.\n\n  My business expenses are $2,000/month for insurance, $800 for equipment payments, $450 for work truck, $700-$800/month in fuel, and my one employee makes roughly 20% of income. Right now business income is about $3,000/week (less than half of what I\u2019m used to bringing in). \n\n  Now the big kicker is work is going to be slow for at least two more months and I will have to travel out of state and start with a different company to make the income I was making.  We just found out my wife is pregnant and I have a job offer to work for a local company making about $30/hr with excellent benefits (401k and health insurance is huge with a child coming). \n\n  I do not think I want to pursue the business anymore and travel with a child on the way.  I do not have enough savings to sell my personal truck and just use my work truck.  Our rent is the cheapest in our area for a small house.  There is a piece of property my father wants to buy with me nearby so we could all live on it.  I just want to live comfortably with this new job and that property.\n\n  Any advice or anyone that has gotten out of a tough spot?  I know this isn\u2019t the worst situation but I do not enjoy living pay check to pay check and renting.",

Potentially higher income if business increases again, but less certainty, high overhead and stress. \n\nOption B Stable Job: Stability, benefits, time at home, but less gross income and giving up on business. (Personally if I had a baby coming I'd be wanting as much stability as possible since that would let me plan.)\n\nOption C: Sell one truck, take stable job, only do fiber on the side.

That would seem to give you the best of both worlds: stability with the options of earning more on the side and not giving up totally on the business you built. \n\n\nRegardless, I don't think it makes sense to continue to be upside down on the truck.
