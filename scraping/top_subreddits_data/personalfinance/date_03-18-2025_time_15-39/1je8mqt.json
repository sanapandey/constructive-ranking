EIEAX is a fund from Eaton Vance, and Fidelity will charge you $49.95 every time you buy.\n\nAnd the fund itself also charges 0.94% of how much you own, every year. \n\nYou should find an index fund instead.

High expense ratios will eat into your gains. Fidelity actually has some zero fee funds that may interest you. Since the one you picked is mostly domestic stock, FZROX is a total US market fund with no fees. Otherwise, FXAIX is the cheapest fund tracking the S&P500 that fidelity offers.",
