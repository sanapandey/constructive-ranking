I make about 55k a year.\n\nAccording to the 30% rule I can spend about about $1,400 per month on housing (30% of my gross monthly income)\n\nBut my take home pay is only $3,284 making $1,400 per month about 45% of my actual income. Isn't that way too much, assuming I want to be able to spend and save comfortably?",

            "body": "The 30% rule really only serves to do a very quick \"should I be thinking more about this?\" check.  It doesn't scale as your take home pay goes up, as many people in HCOL areas will spend more than 50% of their take home pay on housing without hardship because they also take home a high pay to go with it.\n\nThe reason it's against gross instead of net is that people are more likely to know their gross than their net, at least when it comes to salaried workers.",

What you did was important to make sure you could handle not only the mortgage but also unexpected repairs and maintenance issues that could come up later. This also ensures that your expenses generally stay lower than they need to be. It's way easier and more beneficial to deal with a surplus of funds than a lack of funds.\n\nWhat I don't like seeing people do is using the net basis and then justifying a higher rent cost by robbing themselves of their retirement contributions. It's really easy to allow lifestyle creep to take a front seat and lose out on substantial retirement savings because it's so far away that it's out of sight and out of mind. \n\nWhen considering reducing retirement contributions, it's important to think about what the future value given up is rather than the amount contributed today. It's easier to think about reducing retirement savings by $1,000 a year for 10 years, but if you realize that actually means potentially losing out on $75k+ at retirement, then you may start to think twice.",

Being conservative is lovely in an ideal world, but the reality is that if you live in HCOL or VHCOL, budget conscious options don\u2019t exist so buying becomes a risk tolerance question where most households are either over leveraged or renting.

Same with finances - if you're tracking your spending, using debt intelligently, maintaining an emergency fund, and recalibrating semi-frequently, the rules of thumb are insufficiently detailed to really be useful.\n\nAnd the \"woah you're in danger\" being a false alarm is similar. If you can squat 2X your body weight and bench 1.5X your body weight, BMI saying you're overweight is almost definitely a false alarm. Similarly, if you gross 10X the national median income, you already contribute 15+% of your income to savings, you have positive cash flow every month, and you can spend 50% of your gross on a house without taking away from any other important categories, exceeding 30% of your gross is a false alarm.",

If someone puts in 20% to a Traditional IRA, their take-home is going to be lower than someone who only contributes to a Roth IRA (with after-tax funds).  So if the rule was based on take-home pay, that first person would have to back calculate what their take-home would be if they didn't take the tax advantage of the TIRA.  Then there's benefits like insurance, where some people may not have access to work sponsored insurance and pay for that outside of their paycheck.  It just gets jumbled.  Gross pay is a quick snapshot of \"about how much do you make\" and any rules based off of it should be taken with a grain of salt.  \n\nIf the mortgage is 20%, you probably don't have to think much about it, you're good.  If the mortgage is 40% of gross, you probably shouldn't be considering it.  If it's more around that 30%, then defer to a budget.  You ask \"Isn't that way too much, assuming I want to be able to spend and save comfortably?\" Well, how much do YOU need to spend and save comfortably, and how much is leftover?  One person may get free lunches at work, lives in an area that doesn't require a car and can walk to work, won't have an HOA fee, has cheap utilities, etc.  Another person may have a car payment, expensive health insurance, etc, etc.  \n\nTake a look back on your past few months of expenses and make a budget.  Contribute at least 15% gross to retirement.  Save a reasonable amount for future house maintenance and repairs.  Include any other fixed costs.  Include a reasonable amount of spending based on your historical trends.  How much is leftover?

People also understand their gross pay more easily than their net, as an intuitive thing. \n\nAnd I suspect that making a similar general claim based on net (\"no more than 40% of your net pay!\") might lose some of the folksy comfort because it will sound like a bigger number even if the math is the same in the end - so there's some psychology at play there.\n\nUltimately, the less you spend on housing while meeting your needs and feeling safe, the better. 30% of gross is a ceiling, not a target after all. \n\nIn your case I'd say take your net monthly income and start subtracting out your fixed and estimated expenses, as well as any saving goal.
