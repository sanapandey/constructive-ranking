    "selftext": "I'm trying to figure out what we might owe on an inheritance from my dad. He lived in Kansas and set up a trust that was executed by his friend/unmarried partner. It's split mostly evenly between her, myself, and my sister. The grand total of the estate is less that $500k. From what I understand there are a few different places the money is coming from, or different pools. One is investments from Fidelity, one is cash in account, and one is an annuity. Once everything is divested, do we need to be responsible for the estate tax? I know there is no inheritance tax (state or federal for us), but how are estate taxes handled? ",

Like you noted, you are well below the threshold here so this is a non-issue.\n\nInheritance tax (paid by recipients) only exists in some states. I think Kansas is not one of them, but you should double check (ask whatever lawyer is assisting with process here)",
