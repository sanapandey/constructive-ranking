    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'd like apologize in advance for the length of this post. I tried formatting it as nicely as possible to make it easier to read.\n\nI put \"other\" as the flair because this technically has roots in investing, taxes, saving, and planning.\n\nFor context,\n\n* I am 25 years old and live in Nebraska. \n* I make **$100,085.44 pretax**\n* I contribute **$6,005.1 to my 401k (6%)**. My employer matches 100% up to 6% of my salary into my 401k which I take full advantage of. It's invested entirely in SPY and I sell covered calls as Fidelity offers a very nice BrokerageLink feature.\n* I max out my HSA (I technically only contribute **$3,796** since my employer contributes **$500/year** and it counts as a contribution towards the max $4,300)\n* My health insurance is **$1,213.68 a year**\n* **I have zero debt of any kind**\n\nMy final taxable income is **$74,070**. My taxes are broken down like this (this includes all standard deductions and updated tax brackets for 2025):\n\n* Federal tax: **$11,209.55**\n* State tax: **$3,840.76**\n* FICA tax: **$7,273.3**\n\nFor a total taxes paid of **$22,323.61** (22.3% effective tax rate).\n\nAfter all that, I take home around **$1,283 per week** (**$5,562.2 per month**) post tax.  \nUsing monthly numbers for simplicity,\n\n1. **$479** gets automatically transferred to my emergency fund. This is also my \"tax bucket\" for April since I trade options and therefore always owe money each year.\n2. **$583** of that goes into my Roth IRA ($6996/year for almost the max contribution)\n3. **$1000** is needed for my required living expenses (rent, food, car insurance, etc). Yes, I live at home and therefore have low rent.\n4. **$500 to $1000** is fun money (I count restaurants and coffee shops as fun not food)\n5. The remaining **$3,000 - $2,500** is invested into my taxable investment account (more risky than my 401k as it's heavy growth. I also sell options on the indexes for extra income similar to my 401k). I'm trying to FIRE in case it's not obvious.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk, now the boring stuff is over. Time for my question. \n\n>**Should I max out my 401k ($23,500)?**\n\nHere are the updated numbers:\n\n* My taxable income gets lowered to **$56,575.76**\n* Total taxes paid is **$17,564.99**\n   * Federal tax: **$7,360.67**\n   * State tax: **$2,931.03**\n   * FICA tax: **$7,273.30 (no change)**\n* New take home pay is **$1,038.67/week** or **$4,500.9/month**\n\nThis results in the following:\n\n* **$245** less money each weekly paycheck (**$1,061.3 less per month)**\n* Therefore, I'd invest **$1,000** less money to my taxable account each month\n* **$17,494.9** additional contributions to my 401k each year (for the $23,500 max)\n* Most importantly, **$4,758.62 saved in taxes**.\n\nI'm stuck for numerous reasons:\n\n1. My taxable account has a higher return than my 401k, so I feel like the money is better spent there\n2. I'd be locking away **$17,494** a year until I'm 65. I know about Roth conversion ladders, which can be used if I retire early so this might not be that big of a deal\n3. The pro is I **save $4,758 in taxes**. Although, this is irrelevant if I do a Roth conversion ladder since I still pay income tax during the conversion each 5 year period.\n4. Historically, accounting for inflation, federal income taxes have gone down over time whereas FICA taxes have gone up. \n   * So deferring my taxes is smart but it's also possible they go up in the future. There is really no way of knowing\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# What Would You Do?\n\nEveryone I've asked this in person recommended I max out my 401k.\n\nIs maxing my 401k the best move, or is keeping more in my taxable account better? Curious to hear your thoughts!\n\nWhat would you do? Which would be the smartest move?\n\nThank you!  \n  \n",

            "body": "If the invested funds are intended for retirement always max 401k before investing in a taxable brokerage imo. It's just better in every way. You can also access that money prior to age 59.5 if you are thinking of retiring before 59.5 but in general you are best off leaving it in there until retirement. \n\nIf you are thinking of retiring early traditional 401k contributions generally outweigh Roth 401k contributions. Though at your tax bracket it's more of a gray area.",

OP is already saving 12% on the 401k + 6% on Roth IRA + 4% on HSA. That\u2019s plenty for retirement at OPs age.\n\nIf I were OP I\u2019d also look into keeping more liquid savings since that will give the flexibility to move out or purchase a house.",

Our culture can pedestalize home ownership and paying off a mortgage with a low interest rate--just like buying fancy new cars by financing them.

All I can say is when I was that age, I maxed out Roth IRA, 401k (mix of trad and Roth - eventually rolled to IRAs when I left the job), and HSA every possible year.

So if you had 0 ordinary income and lived off $48,350 of capital gains from a taxable brokerage account, then that money is not being taxed. Meanwhile you convert as much as you can up to $533,540 such that the traditional funds only get taxed at 15% or less. 15% or less is still better than the 22% you would otherwise be paying\n\nAlso, there is rule 72t withdrawals that can make retirement money mo4e accessible. It is more complicated and risky, but read up on it.",
