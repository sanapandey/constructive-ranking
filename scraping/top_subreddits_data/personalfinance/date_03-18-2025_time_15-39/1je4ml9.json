We asked if he would be able to look at all of our finances and tell us if we're putting our money in the right buckets. He said yes. I then asked what the fee was for this analysis and he said no cost. I asked if there was an obligation to open some investments with with TIAA and he said no. \n\n  \nIs it normal for financial advisors to not charge a fee? ",

If for some reason you want some kind of complex equity portfolio, sure it might help you avoid unnecessary commissions. But for IRAs, I generally think your best bet is a simple portfolio of broad A-share mutual funds. If you have enough assets, you don't pay any up-front sales charge while your FA still gets a 2% dealer concession. If you bought advisory class shares sure your expense ratio would be a little lower, but you'd have a percentage taken EVERY year.\n\n\nMost people's finances are not complicated enough to require complex, fee-based asset management. You just have to question why an FA would choose to stick you in equities that cost higher commissions than decent mutual funds. (Obviously this doesn't apply as much to non-retirement accounts where yearly taxable capital gains distributions from mutual funds would hit you hard)",

The FA getting concessions (which increases the funds' expense ratios) doesn't prevent them from also charging an AUM fee.\n\nHowever by being fee-only, where the FA's revenue is derived only from client fees, that advisor eliminates any financial incentive that may bias their recommendations.",

However, I guess I'm 1) taking for granted that lots of people are not able to get funds at NAV and 2) I'm better-equipped to clock an FA pushing high-commission products than the average poster so the idea doesn't spook me as much.",
