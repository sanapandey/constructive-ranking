I had always obviously been aware of my salary but hadn\u2019t really ever considered what I make all-in with bonus and RSUs. I was kind of blown away to see it on paper - $550k. Never thought I\u2019d ever make half a mil. Celebrating a bit today!",

With how everything has been in the stock market and politically in the last two months, I\u2019m curious how horrible of an idea it is to just sell my stock now and maybe rebuild while the market is in correction territory for who knows how long. If I did sell my entire portfolio, I\u2019d be able to cover all of my current credit card debt, and I would basically only have my student loans left. I am also contributing with the maximum match of my 401k. Any insight or any comments just tell me I\u2019m a moron for considering it are very helpful.",

If you have credit card debt you should be prioritizing paying that off.  Do you have an emergency fund?  Use that, and then replenish it.  If you have stocks outside of reitrement accounts you could sell those too.\n\n3. If you don't have an emergency fund prioritize that over a car.\n\nFollow the steps at [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)",

I understand that mm and hysa change with interest rates, but i didn't realize that this was used as an excuse to lure you in and then give you a noncompetitive rate. I also learned, from perusing this sub and my banks sub, that this is a common practice for my bank in particular. And yes, yes i know we should have read the fine print when siging up. My question here is - do all banks operate this way? Is the only way to benefit from competitive mm or hysa rates is to constantly switch accounts all the time?",
