    "selftext": "I have an HSA for the first time this year. My employer contributes $200/month, and at the end of this month I'll have contributed my entire max contribution of $2900 for the year (I'm over 55). I don't plan to spend any of the money this year. It's currently just getting basic interest of .10% but there are two investment options available - guided or not. The guided option costs .05%/month ($15 max waived for first 90 days) plus an admin fee of .03% ($10 max). Should I just pick the guided option, given that I know nothing about any of this? ",

Find a fund that you are allowed to invest in through your HSA that meets those criteria. Post the tickers that you can choose from here if you are having trouble deciphering the funds.",

Right this minute it's hard to say whether I can afford to do that long term because my employment isn't very stable beyond this year. I have an outstanding health plan and as long as I'm in that plan I won't need to use the HSA. There's a possibility I could stay in the plan if I lost my job and could afford it. (I work for a church that's not doing well. The plan is denominational, so I'd have the same plan if I worked at another church in the denomination, and they also allow former employees to buy in. I might pursue self-employment and do that if I lose the job.)",

That should have been the first fund that your admin chose. But that's water under the bridge. \n\nVTSAX is good if you want to take a risk. Or VTTHX if you want to be more conservative, given you might retire in 10 years.",
