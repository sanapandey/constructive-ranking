    "selftext": "So Im a 24m currently living at home and looking to move into an apartment soon. Right now, I have $10k in a HYSA as my emergency fund, a little over $14k in a Roth IRA for retirement - Im about $400 from maxing out my contribution for 2025 (which I plan to contribute this week). My plan is to get $10k into a taxable brokerage account and get my emergency fund to $12k before looking for apartments (specifically ones where rent does not exceed 30% of my monthly net income. I do have a gf that can split expenses with me so that broadens the possibilities a bit.) I also have a reliable vehicle which is paid off and currently make about $60k a year total comp with a monthly after tax income of about $3.7k. Is this a solid plan or should I make some tweaks? Am I moving too quickly or being too conservative? Any and all feedback would be appreciated. ",

I stick to a pretty strict budget and rn bc of low living expenses I\u2019m able to save/invest 75-80% of my monthly income. Looking forward to pulling the reigns back a bit and converting to a 50/25/25 budgeting approach. Not looking forward to higher living expenses though lol.",

            "body": "How much is in your retirement fund is irrelevant to your current housing costs unless you'd have to sacrifice making large contributions to make it happen. How much is in your taxable brokerage account is also somewhat irrelevant - I wouldn't consider it a part of my liquid accounts and you shouldn't ever need to rely on money there in a short-term setting. \n\nTherefore, unless you have money elsewhere, I'd say you have 10k saved up, with a goal of having 12k before looking for apartments. This seems reasonable depending on where you're at in the country - goal of about $1k/mo on rent which becomes a $2000/mo cost if split with a partner is very achievable and opens up a larger number of options to you. Let's say you go for the most expensive option and need to pay first and last months rent + a security deposit, that's about $3k. Now your E-fund is down to $9k. If you have no other debt, let's estimate 6mo e-fund to require $6k for rent + $3k left over for food and other expenses, that also seems reasonable. \n\nSo, I'd say your plan is fine as long as you've run numbers on your monthly expenses and have thought about how much you'd be able to save into retirement and personal savings with that additional monthly cost.",

                    "body": "Thank you for your feedback and thorough response! I get that retirement savings aren\u2019t really relevant to my ability to cover short term expenses/debts, but there are of course recommended retirement savings amounts based on age, and my ability to contribute to those savings would be negatively impacted by increased living expenses. Also just wanted to provide a full picture of my financial situation.\n\nWith that being said, I have considered the upfront costs of getting an apartment i.e. a security deposit and possibly first and last month\u2019s rent like you mentioned. My plan would likely be to take that from my emergency fund and then focus on building that back up to $12k before continuing to invest. I do pay about $300 in student loan payments each month and have a couple other monthly expenses (phone bill, car insurance, etc) but based on the numbers you presented maybe $12k is a little over a full 6 month emergency fund. I plan on implementing a 50/25/25 budgeting strategy once I do move out which I feel pretty confident I\u2019ll be able to achieve. Thank you again for your response!",
