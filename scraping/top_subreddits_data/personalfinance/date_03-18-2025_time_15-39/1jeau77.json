    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some advice on behalf of my mother-in-law, Linda. She\u2019s 66, recently widowed, and trying to figure out where to park $60k-80k with Vanguard (or really, anywhere). She\u2019s retired and gets Social Security every month, but she wants to invest this money in a way that keeps it growing while still being somewhat safe. She has no expenses as she lives with us and we take care of her. \n\nSince she doesn\u2019t have earned income, she can\u2019t contribute to an IRA, so we\u2019re looking at a regular brokerage account instead. The goal is a mix of stability, some income, and a bit of growth.\n\nWe\u2019re considering:\n\t1.\tVanguard Wellesley Income (VWIAX) \u2013 40% stocks, 60% bonds, pays steady dividends.\n\t2.\tVanguard Balanced Index (VBIAX) \u2013 60% stocks, 40% bonds, a little more growth.\n\t3.\tVanguard Total Stock Market (VTSAX) \u2013 All stocks, more risk but long-term gains.\n\t4.\tVanguard Federal Money Market (VMFXX) \u2013 Basically a high-yield savings account alternative.\n\nA few things I\u2019d love input on:\n\t\u2022\tDoes this mix make sense? Should she go heavier in stocks or stick with bonds?\n\t\u2022\tTax efficiency \u2013 Since this is a taxable account, are there better options to avoid getting hit with unnecessary taxes?\n\t\u2022\tWithdrawal strategy \u2013 She doesn\u2019t need the money right away, but what\u2019s the best way to access it later without screwing herself on taxes?\n\nAny advice from those who have invested in a similar situation (or just know their Vanguard stuff). It doesn\u2019t even have to be vanguard. I just want to help keep her money safe. My mother in laws daughters (except my awesome wife) have recently been trying to take advantage of her. For instance, my wife\u2019s sister asked for a 20k loan (initially she wanted 60k) and wanted to pay her 50 a month for 3 years and then 350 until it was paid off (scam right?). \n\nWould love any and all help! Please call me out if I\u2019m wrong. Thank you! ",

            "body": "If her income is just social security and dividends/interest from $60,000, she should not owe any taxes.  Even if she takes distributions.  She files with form 1040-SR.\n\nSince she is 65 or more, she is at standard deduction of $16,550, if she is blind, she is at $18,500 , those are 2024 numbers.  I am 65 or more.\n\nShe fills out the Social Security Worksheet which is on Page 32 of form 1040 instructions.  My guess her taxes will be ZERO.\n\nIf her SS payment is $2000 a month or less, she owes nothing.  If her SS payment is $3000 a month she owes taxes on 50%.\n\nTo put it simply, her income is $36000 she claims 50% as income or $18000.  She claims the standard deduction of $16,550 she would owe taxes on $1,450, she would awe around $144 in taxes.\n\nYou should know what she has on her form 1040-SR already.  She pays medicare and she might have taxes withheld.\n\nI have been with Vanguard since 1983.\n\nI do not believe in owning bonds when bond yields are 7% or less.  I do not believe in owning any bond fund EVER.  That is just me.  It has worked out well for me by not owning any bond funds.\n\nVMFXX is their settlement fund and HYSA fund.  Vanguard does it the right way by just putting people in a good interest paying account, quite a few other brokerages do NOT do that.  This is safe, but not a way to grow money.\n\nVIG is a dividend paying sort of growth fund.  It is 100% stocks that pay dividends.  I have owned this mutual fund since inception and I am thinking of selling.  I never paid much attention to it as it is not a lot of money so it has just been in my taxable brokerage account and I think I made a bad choice nearly 20 years ago.  Its dividend yield is around 1.6% but its annual return has been around 9%.\n\nVEUSX is a 100% European stock fund.  This one will probably outperform the S&P 500 this year.  Overall, international stocks have under performed compared to USA, this year will be the exception.\n\nVFIAX is the S&P 500 Index Fund  If you believe America is the place to be, this is the fund to be in.  its dividend yield is about 1.3% and its annual return has been around 11%.\n\nVWIAX has a 10 year return of 5.5%.  No thanks.\n\nVBIAX has a 10 year return of 8.12%.  Better than VWIAX.\n\nVTSAX has a 10 year return of 12.3%.  Now you are talking.  It pays a dividend in March, June, September, and December.  It owns 3600 US stocks, large cap, mid cap, small cap, everything America has to offer.\n\nI would go 100% VTSAX and bet on America.\n\nedit:  I just read where she sold her house and has $150,000 so that changes her taxes for the year she sold the house.  That will put her social security into the she pays taxes on 85% of her SS payment but just for that one year.\n\nIs that $150,000 all cap gains or can she deduct improvements to the house such as a new patio, adding a second floor, improving the insulation, adding solar panels, etc.\n\nReplacing windows is NOT an improvement.  Replacing the siding is not an improvement.  Replacing the roof is not an improvement unless she upgraded to some superior roofing system and that still has to be justified.\n\nThe sister was NEVER going to pay back Mom.  My sister sucked as much money out of my parents as she could while they were alive, my brother in law did the same thing to my spouse's parents.  What is funny, is one of my BIL's daughters is sucking him dry.  Luckily, our kids do not ask us for money.\n\nI like how it was going to go from $50 a month but in three years it would miraculously go to $350.",

Aggressively invest the $60k and keep the SS income in cash.\n\n>without screwing herself on taxes?\n\nIt's almost mathematically impossible for $60k, conservatively invested, to result in a \"screwing\" level of taxes. Even aggressively invested is unlikely to reach that level.\n\ne:word",

Putting the majority into VMFXX/equivalents seems wise.   \n\n* If she has something she wants to do (cruise, vacation, hike, train trip), spend money now, as there is no guarantee of being able to do it in five years.  Health is not guaranteed.\n\n* Taxes are almost immaterial as the returns generated by this are in the single digit thousands.  \n\n* Really it comes down to risk tolerance and potential need timeline.  She can invest in the 4-5% return area with very minimal risk, and not lose out to inflation.  Does she want the stress of seeing a balance get smaller?  If the stock market drops 30% a la 2008, and she has $40k in the market and it becomes $28k, does she want to see that?  \n* Keeping her protected from family members seeking to take advantage of her fiscally is very nice of you.",

The sister has been hounding her relentlessly for money and I want to ensure she can keep it somewhere safe where she is also limited to withdrawals (the sister truly takes advantage of her and we have the texts backing it up)\n\nWould putting all of it in VMFXX be wise? Can she make withdrawals or is it just there?\n\nAgain. New to all of this. Personally, I just send money to my target date fund (34 yrs old) and check it once a year but I\u2019m Not sure that would work for her.",
