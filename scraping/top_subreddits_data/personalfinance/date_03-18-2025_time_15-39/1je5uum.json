    "selftext": "I have been contributing 7% of my paycheck into my 401k, the amount I need to get my employer match. By this time next year, I will be 20% vested. But I am a military spouse, and the chances of me still living here in a years time is slim to none.\n\nI've read through the directive to figure out what I should be doing with my money, but I'm still confused. If the match doesn't matter, should I instead be working on paying down debt or should I be contributing to some other account?\n\n My spouse and I have $40,000 combined in student loans, although everything is deferred right now because we were on Save before I started working. We own our cars outright and have no credit card debt. If it is relevant, my husband contributes 5% of his pay into his TSP.\n\nEdit: To let you all in on my financial situation more, we just paid off the cars and credit cards. We have no emergency fund now, which is probably pretty dumb that we didn't start with that, but thankfully we didn't have anything come up while we were paying everything off. We are starting our emergency fund now. Our current student loan payment is zero because of save, and there is not a requirement to recertify right now because of the litigation. We have an extra $2000 after monthly expenses.",

I would increase that, because it's better than your plan.",

It kind of feels like this fake marketplace that the government set up for financial institutions, told them they'll guarantee them customers and they can offer crappy non-flexible target rate funds and then charge you a % management fee on top of that.  I stopped contributing to mine this year and started investing on my own.  My personal account that I self manage is up to 100+% in gains.  I just don't find it lucrative to get a tiny match and tax break to get sucked into an ecosystem designed to quietly milk you and make you a product.",

This means that if you make your monthly payment, your loan balance won\u2019t grow due to unpaid interest that accrued since your last payment.`\n\n>`For example: If $50 in interest accumulates each month and you have a $30 scheduled payment, the remaining $20 would not be charged once you make your monthly payment on time.`\n\nThis means OP is on a program that lets them pay below the minimum amount to even address the interest that is accruing on the loan, much less doing anything to the principle. It's very important for OP to be contributing to their retirement but they are doing so at 7% right now. Based on what the SAVE program is, they are only treading water on their student loans.",
