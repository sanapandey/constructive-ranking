    "selftext": "I am currently 36 and have been maxing my 401k for years, first as a conventional, more recently as a Roth 401k.  Somebody mentioned something about RMDs and how if you don't handle your strategy correctly, you may end up with a substantial tax bill.   \n\nCan somebody explain the nuance of how this works?  Is there a reason I shouldn't keep piling resources into my retirement count now?    It feels like more of a withdrawal strategy problem, but curious if I am missing something. ",

When you're 75* (changes based on your birth year) you'll have to take distributions from taxable accounts.\n\n\nYou can minimize this by doing partial Roth conversions over your lifetime. A CFP or tax planner (EA or CPA) can help you decide when is the right time to do that. Not all 401k plans will allow in service conversions, so you'll have to look at the policy documents for your plan.",
