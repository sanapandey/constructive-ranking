    "selftext": "In January 3 pipes busted in my home causing major damage to my homes foundation to where contractor says it's not liveable. State Farm denied the claim as their loophole states if water goes into the ground they are not responsible.  This makes no sense to me I've been with them over 40 years never filed a claim. How can they deny  my claim  I'm pretty much homeless now as I don't have the money to fix I thought that's why we pay gir insurance???",

You can hire a lawyer to maybe get you something if your insurer messed up handling your claim in some way that wouldn't be obvious to a regular person (took too long to respond or issue a coverage decision, something like that).\n\nJust to be clear though, you weren't covered for this type of damage, you were paying less on your policy because you denied flood insurance when you requested State Farm insure your property. You are likely too old for this to happen to again but it is a bad idea not to have flood insurance on 40+ year old pipes.",
