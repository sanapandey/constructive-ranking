    "selftext": "I inherited an ira from my father, that is currently held with Edward Jones, I'm thinking of opening my own Roth IRA soon with Fidelity. I know I have to withdraw all the funds by 2033.\n\nI'm currently taking about $1,000-$1,500 a month as income from this inherited IRA, and have raised my 401k contributions (40% total, 15% traditional and 25% Roth, I also can do in plan conversions) with my job to offset this to a degree.\n\nThe initial inherited balance I started with was $57,603.16; I've withdrawn $19,411.75 with a value return in $10,799.94 and a personal Rate of Return of $15.96% this is since inception in November of 2023\n\nLooking at my latest statement Edward Jones fee is about $57 a month. \n\nAll this being said, am I better off opening a new IRA and swapping custodians? Staying the course? Having monthly payments split between an income source, and funding the new Roth IRA I plan to open?\n\nAdditional information, I have $10,400 in my checking account that I earn 5% on, and about $50,000 in a HYSA that I just converted to be joint so my wife can contribute mutually to that. I have not contributed to an IRA for the 2024 year yet, and was trying to figure out the best way to go about this before April, any advice or insight is greatly appreciated!",

Depending when exactly you took the withdrawals, seems like it's over 1% but lower than 2%. At $57/mo, you are paying them just under $700/year to ... do what?",

And if you're in the 22% bracket you probably shouldn't be making Roth contributions to a workplace retirement plan at all (or doing in-plan conversions that aren't part of a mega backdoor Roth strategy).
