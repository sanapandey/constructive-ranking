There are hidden ones, too: the car is still depreciating, and some maintenance needs to be done eventually whether the car drives or not (oil, tires).\n\n$250 for insurance for a rarely driven third car is ridiculous, and more than enough reason to get rid of it - if the OP has done their due dilligence on other ways to reduce the insurance cost. \n\nRegistration is in most states the one other inevitable expense.  Depending on the state and the age of the car, that can range from insignificant to expensive.\n\nParking may be limited; the reason we didn't keep my wife's old car (which was ~13 years old, had a lot of cosmetic damage but ran great and was in good mechanical shape) is that we don't have a third parking spot.  The whole carrying cost for the car  was trivial around here.\n\nOil and tires for a car being driven a few times a month are insignificant expenses unless you're very broke, should average out under $20/month over time - that's like one Uber ride around here in the burbs.  Other time-based maintanence will average more, but for a common vehicle will still be very inexpensive compared to other costs.  (That also assumes that this is a normal, inexpensive to maintain vehicle. Exceptions will cost a lot more - don't try this if it's a European luxury/sports car, for example :) )\n\nDepending on the age of the car, it may be (essentially) fully depreciated.  If it isn't, and you're savvy enough to get a good price for an older vehicle, it can make sense to get rid of it to avoid the depreciation hit, but past a certain age getting a good price is a lot of work.\n\nOnce you're at whatever the baseline \"anything that can be legally registered and doesn't have horrible cosmetic damage will sell for this much\" cost in your area, it will usually cease to be a good option.\n\nThe big risk on keeping a fully-depreciated car is that something serious will break that costs more than the car is worth (either in your utility OR market value) to fix, in which case you've basically lost the couple-$1000 that a fully depreciated car would otherwise be worth on the private market.  That's not a bad bet to take on a reliable car, but not a bet everyone would want to take (and not one you should take if this is a car known as needing a lot of repairs.)",

I work from home, and our second car gets around 6,000 miles a year just from errands and occasional weekend trips.",

This should be much less than $250/mo. but will affect the math.\n\n2. Depending on your current handling of finances and property, which of you enjoys the act of driving more when you're going someplace together, whether you both want you alone to handle all driving-required errands, and any emotional factors that might also be in play... You may want to reconceive \"your\" (singular) car as \"the family car\" as far as you and your husband go.
