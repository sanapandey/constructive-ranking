Sold half of them when started to decline and progressively sold out finishing with +80% overall since weekend! I personally think it can get to 200% but not worth the risk with 3 days that left to expiration... I placed half of that money on deep ITM Siemens Energy calls. They are almost printing now and no doubt it will rise this year more than current value. (OTM was expensive as hell, you make same profit with ITM in +20% uprise and clearly 0 risk)",

For good reason. \n\nNATO was far stronger 2 months ago, before Trump started trade wars on our allies (they're called a war for a reason, we've been attacking the economies of our allies), suggested that he wouldn't come to their defense if attacked (undermining the core rationale for NATO), and siding with Russia in its conflict on Ukraine. That Trump is also threatening not one but two NATO allies with violence and demands they give up territory to us further undermines the entire alliance. \n\nEurope isn't rearming to placate Trump, they're doing it because they see us as a dire threat. In other words, they're moving away from a US-led NATO and making Europe more independent of the US altogether. That's not a good thing for the US at all.",
