No official comments available.\n\nI bought them also because they seemed to me to have a low valuation after a bad year when I got in. No idea at all how realistic it is with Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems.\n\nAnyhow, they pay me a little dividend while I can wait a long time for the stock to rise in such occasions.\n\nIn two days they release the 2024 earnings.\n\nIR website : https://www.deutz.com/en/investor-relations/\n\nrumoured interest in Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems : https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/der_boersen_tag/Bericht-Deutz-hat-Interesse-an-Marinegeschaeft-von-Thyssenkrupp-article25477343.html\n\nplans for venturing more into defense : https://www.deraktionaer.de/artikel/aktien/nach-rheinmetall-renk-und-hensoldt-deutz-will-ruestungsbranche-aufmischen-plaene-konkretisiert-20373277.html",
