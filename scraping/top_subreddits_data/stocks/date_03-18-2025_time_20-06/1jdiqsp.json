    "selftext": "What can I do with these? They're official stock certificates from the 80s, previous owners long gone (I think there have been three or four homeowners between then and now).\n\nAre they worth anything? Who do I take them to if they are?\n\n  \nEDIT: Correction, just one stock certificate. I thought there were more in this big box but it's just a ton of old tax documents. But the certificate is for twenty shares and it's dated 1989.\n\nEDIT 2: I got into contact with the original owner\u2019s daughter, who is now in her 70s and had no idea it existed. Her mother, the original owner of the stock certificate, worked for Boeing for many years and was the first female flight supervisor in their area. I will be giving them the certificate this evening. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night if I didn\u2019t at least try to get these documents back to their rightful owners. \n\nEDIT 3: The original owner\u2019s grandson came and picked up the certificate as well as two more boxes of old letters and documents from his late grandmother. We had a great conversation and they want to invite us over soon for dinner after they go through everything and reminisce. I feel very good about the outcome of the situation. ",

Do you think the owner \"loses\" their shares or they would stop receiving dividend payments?  No, because the transfer agent has the owner on record.\n\nIt's possible some physical to electronic conversion was done, and the physical paper was not collected.  In that case, you might be able to keep the certificates and perhaps they have some collectible value.  But I would say the chance of you being able to claim ownership of the actual shares is slim to none.",

Stock or bond certificates had been issued in this form, but since it has obvious uses for tax evasion and other nefarious things, they were discontinued. It\u2019s very unlikely the Boeing certificates are in this form.\n\n2. Registered stock certificate. The owner of the stock is both on the certificate and in the company\u2019s records. If John Doe sells to Jane Smith, John Doe has to endorse the certificate over to Jane Smith. Jane Smith can then turn in the certificate to the company to become the owner on their books.\n\nIf John Doe loses the certificate, then he can post a bond to nevertheless get a new certificate. If the old certificate is presented by an innocent purchaser due to fraud, then the company is obligated under two different certificates.\n\nThe vastly shortened version is that, since you aren\u2019t John Doe, you can\u2019t sell the stock certificate legally. If, in theory, you could pull it off with a fake ID, it would be like finding a check to John Doe and cashing it with a fake ID. In practice, it may not be possible with stock certificates.",

Boeing has split 6 times since 1979, conservatively if these shares were purchased mid 80, the shares had two 3:2 splits and one 2:1 split, so those 20 shares would have become 90 shares, and that\u2019s about $14k right there at current share prices.",

Assuming you purchased 20 shares at this price, your initial investment would be approximately $212.40.\n\nFast-forward to today, Boeing's current stock price is around $161.81 per share \u00b2. However, we need to account for stock splits. According to Boeing's investor relations website, the company has had several stock splits since 1989 \u00b3.\n\nUsing a historical investment calculator, such as the one provided by FinMasters \u2074, we can estimate the current value of your investment. Assuming the calculator accounts for stock splits and dividends, your 20 shares of Boeing in 1989 would be equivalent to approximately 160 shares today, considering the 10-for-1 stock split in 1997 and other subsequent splits.\n\nWith the current stock price, your investment would be worth around $25,729.60 (160 shares x $161.81 per share). That's a significant return on investment, with a total profit of around $25,517.20.\n\nPlease note that this calculation is an estimate and actual values may vary depending on various market and economic factors.",
