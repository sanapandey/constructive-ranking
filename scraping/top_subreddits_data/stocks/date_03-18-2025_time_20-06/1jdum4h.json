Dont get me wrong, Chinese government subsidies are hugely important to bringing their prices down, but that's not *the reason* why the price is so low. \n\nChina has the most advanced, integrated logistics system on the planet. They produce most, if not all, of the inputs for the vehicle in country, sometimes in the same region, have one of the newest and most integrated rail networks on the planet, have cutting edge automated manufacturing facilities, and some of the most advanced automated dock facilities too. \n\nIn other words, from digging the raw materials out of the ground, to refining and processing them, to using those materials to make the vehicles, to shipping those vehicles to markets all over the world, the system is incredibly efficient, fast, and cheap due to vertical integration. \n\nI'm not a fan of the CCP, they're objectively a huge threat to the free world, but its not *just* government subsidies allowing companies like BYD to produce some of the cheapest, most advanced vehicles on the planet.",

So much goal post moving.\n\nStarted with \"who the hell uses lidar\" went to ,\"radar not lidar\",  passed to \"lidar for high end only\", finished with \"yeah they use lidar but their cameras are bad\".\n\nDude... Common! Look at what you wrote and accept that you are biased to say the least and just accept the truth. Because this chain of comments is just pathetic and transparent.",

So it would mean, you\u2019d need lidar for all other cars. So who else are using? Apart from some niche models. Would you say, BMW succeeded because the i7 is using lidar?? No right? Would you say Mercedes had a triumph with their EQS for having lidar ?? (EQS sales is so pathetic btw). No right?? \n\nSo it is not a reasonable argument to begin with. All the other models from BMW and Mercedes are using radar for detection. Not lidar.\n\nSo the point is, to attribute Tesla\u2019s \u201cdownfall\u201d to lidar is absurd. It has no connection whatsover. See the point?",

EVs with ICE range extenders that had 800+ miles of range. Interiors that looked like luxury cars. \n\nThe only thing missing is the US service network. You'd be fucked if you had a Chinese EV today and something broke. \n\nIf Ford or others were smart, and if the government would let them, they'd create a separate division, import Chinese EVs, rebrand them, and be able to immediately eat Tesla's lunch. That buys you time to learn how the Chinese are doing it, build out your own manufacturing, then wean yourself off the imported cars.

I have a Hyundai Ioniq 6 and I get about 300 miles in 15-18 minutes at any charger that can pull at least 235kw (which is almost exclusively Elecrify America stations, still). It would be amazing if I could do that charge in 5 minutes. \n \nThough honestly I don't mind taking breaks from driving for 20 minutes while I shop or eat or just rest, but still this is really impressive. \n \nI'm hoping that tech can be combined with solid state batteries in the near future, so you get 800+ miles on a single charge and can still charge it quickly for road trips. That would make EVs really unstoppable (as long as they're affordable), especially considering much lower cost in maintenance compared to ICEs due to far fewer moving parts. Honestly that would be a huge boon to EV public transport and freight as well, I imagine, something with massive range that can charge very quickly.\n \nI have a hard time imagining Tesla is still around by then anywhere except the US unless they manage to completely separate from Musk. I do think Tesla could recover and improve long-term if Musk was no longer a part of it, but it would take major changes as well. For one, they need to reintroduce lidar, and add more surface controls beyond just a touch screen. Actually different looking models would go a long way as well. But that's all highly unlikely compared to Musk simply cratering the company alongside cratering the US, and the US essentially cratering its own EV adoption and market by placing what I imagine will be tariffs on all EVs that aren't Tesla, in a desperate attempt to save a burning Tesla in the next few years. There's also high odds that EV charging infrastructure is simply undone as a result in the US, which would completely destroy the EV market in the US. Just no point to owning an EV in the US of all places if you can't take it farther than a hundred miles from your home, and that requires you to own a home to begin with. All of that would make EVs incredibly niche in the US. Hope I'm wrong though, obviously. I drive an EV exclusively, take it on road trips, and want the market to flourish in the US.",

To be honest most charging infrastructure in other countries is actually *behind* the US in that regard, as absurd as that sounds, and driving across the US still comes with range anxiety even with EA stations, and even with perfect environmental conditions and eco-friendly acceleration and ipedal settings. \n \nYou could eliminate a fair amount of that range anxiety if your effective range was more than doubled from current high range EVs. Many people still don't buy EVs due to the limited range compared to ICE counterparts, even if their anxiety isn't based in reality. It's based on comparison to what they have right now.",

I was nearly 3pm before i found a fast charger (50kW CCS). The charger was definitely not on my route. I had to basically ignore my trip and just go in whatever direction i could find one. In EVs defense, i did drive by a few Tesla (NACS) fast chargers while searching and level 2 chargers (which would've taken like 5 hours to charge).\n\nBy the time i finished charging (got enough charge for the trip; not filled) it was 4. A line had formed for the charging station (only 2 or 3 available). So you can imagine how much more time would've been killed if I had made it 45 minutes later.\n\nFinish my business where i went to, now i'm at a small-ish city (not rural by any means). the first 2 chargers i go to are busted. wound up finding a charger at a dealership to get my charge in (also not on the route back). took about 25 minutes from deciding \"lets find a charger\" to finally charging.\n\nKeeping in mind this vehicle does advertise 15minute charge to 80%, but good luck finding a 250kw charger. This experience told me i'm definitely not ready for an EV.\n\nI'm sure plenty of people could make it work if you are willing to structure a lot of what you do around availability of chargers. But regardlessof range, if chargers are that hard to get ahold of and the government isn't incentivizing companies, there'll be a lot of holdouts on EVs.\n\nIn addition to all this, I should mention that when using a fast charger I was paying ~50c/kwh. the model 3 for example gets just under 4 miles/kwh (in ideal conditions, this drops noticeably in winter or really hot summers). i.e., assumign the vehicle i had did similar, then i was paying 13cents per mile.\nMy old 200k mile prius was doing 43mpg at worst, and i was paying about $3/gallon. which comes out to 7 cents per mile. Basically, at a fast charger, your money to miles efficiency is basically that of a chevy colorado.",
