The market went down abou 25% in 2022 but see no one talking about that now. Is there any reason to think it won't go back up after a year or 2? Asking those who are at least 30 years of age.",

Death of world trade due to Smoot-Hawkey tariffs \n\n2. Government policies destroying what was built under TR\u2019s \u201cProgressive era\u201d\n\n3. Collapse of money supply.\n\n4. Bank failures as public panicked.\n\n5. 1929 stock market crash.\n\n\nYou can see, the recipe is there for Trump to repeat Hoover\u2019s missteps. Whether he will or not is the uncertainty we are seeing play out in the market. Uncertainty isn\u2019t good, but it\u2019s not a Depression causing event, and corrections happen every few years.\n\nBut what do I know, I\u2019m on here spouting opinions with no degree in economics, too.",

You started to see a few cracks in 2020 where Trump wanted to go further and crazier but COVID basically changed the dynamics. \n\nCouple that with the nonstop talk of how Democracy will collapse if Trump was even president for a day and you had a lot of people who looked back and said \"Hey, America didn't collapse. You lied to me. Trump must be right!\" without realizing the root causes of why things didn't go crazy in the first term, etc. I do think that not treating him like a normal politician has led to a LOT of problems, one of which is that people were more inclined to back him this time",

Friedman came up with the idea; that you can actually accomplish extremely destructive and unpopular economic policies if you do everything all at once rather than piecemeal. It's called shock therapy. The theory is that doing as much as possible as quickly as possible numbs the popular response because there is too much to respond to. Times of crisis are particularly potent in order to achieve this, but this time they got control of enough levers, they believe they don't need the crisis to justify their changes.\n\nThe goal is to completely break public subsidies and privatize everything. At least, that's the goal of some of the white house team. Not all, but some. Tbh, I'm not completely sure if Trump doesn't honestly believe that instituting tarrifs will bring back America as a manufacturing giant. But they aren't going to be doing large-scale investments... so it's all just dumb.",

It's maybe a thousand employees (their parent company has just 5,400 employees total globally).  It just doesn't take that many employees to distill liquor \n\nBuuuuut, to your point, if Jack Daniels can't export product, downstream distributors are all gonna lose a lot of revenue.  Output reduction means a massive cut in tax revenue for TN, and a corresponding squeeze on the state's ability to fund state programs.  That in turn will ripple into impacts on other areas of the state's economy.  \n\nNow the auto industry... If Hyundai shutters their Montgomery plant due to increased tariffs... The whole city of Montgomery AL will rapidly lose all their progress of the last 15 years and backslide into the \"worse than Detroit\" state it had been rotting away in when they lost their textile industry",

We have tools in place to prevent that. \n\n\t1.\tTrade & Tariffs \u2013 Smoot-Hawley was an all-out trade war that collapsed global trade. Even if Trump continues these ridiculous tariffs, the U.S. economy is far more consumer-driven today (~70% of GDP). In particular, agriculture was a significant piece of U.S. employment in the 1920s (about 25% vs less than 1% today). Smoot-Hawley significantly decreased global demand for U.S. crops, which crippled U.S. employment. \n\n\t2.\tGovernment Policy \u2013 1920s deregulation had no safety nets (FDIC, Social Security, monetary policy). Today\u2019s economy is far more stabilized with intervention tools.\n\n\t3.\tMoney Supply & Banking System \u2013 The 1930s saw a monetary collapse and thousands of bank failures due to a lack of backstops. Today, the Fed has aggressive intervention tools (QE, rate cuts, deposit guarantees).\n\n\t4.\tStock Market \u2013 While today\u2019s valuations are high, the 1929 crash was fueled by massive leverage and no regulations. Today, corporate earnings are still strong, and markets are better regulated.\n\nA recession is definitely possible. A 1929-style collapse is highly unlikely.

They are a huge producer economy, and the US is a huge consumption economy. Without the US, they will have to slash their prices like crazy, just like China has been doing.  And there's no one for EU to sell to, other than China, which is  suffering from overproduction right now. \n\nThird, even if the retaliation tariffs happen, you really think gdp decline is gonna quadruple?

Barely changed Chinas behavior and actually allowed it to accelerate towards becoming a global superpower with focus on self reliance and improvement in global influence.\n\n  \nTariffs these days together with everything lead to Canada strenghtening its relationship with EU and EU to pour 800 bils in its own defense, which they will avoid buying from USA and start manufacturing themselves.\n\nIt seems like every time those tariffs is there it just weakens USAs global dominance and strenghtens everyone elses.

            "body": "You may be a u/shit-starter, but you're smart to ask - just because the has market gone down and recovered doesn't necessarily mean it'll recover every time it goes down.\n\nThe simplest way to approach this is to think about whether the country's productive capacity remains intact i.e. how the maximum amount of goods and services a country can produce changes. For example, Covid lockdown was a 2-years earnings lost, but because bankruptcy was kept to a minimum, productive capacity didn't change much. We could pick up from where we left off.\n\nTariffs and retaliatory tariffs means increased cost of production and decrease foreign demand. This translates to a temporary decrease in productive capacity (i.e. the country produces fewer goods with the same amount of capital). In the near term, we'll expect a lockdown-like downturn due to depressed earnings (high cost, lower demand). We could still pick up from where we left off once tariffs are lifted.\n\nWhat makes this different is the government's commitment to tariffs, i.e. it won't be lifted in the near term. In fact, it seems the tariffs situation would worsen. This means that the economy is expected to operated at a depressed earning level for some time. If the government have it their way, this is the new norm. This could be a permanent reduction in productive capacity.\n\nWorse still, protracted period of depressed earnings would start forcing less competitive firms out of the industry. Now this is a permanent reduction. And unlike lockdown period where we could give handouts to tide through the downturn, there is no tiding through this - the tariffs situation is entirely self-imposed, potentially permanent.\n\nThere are many other reasons, but IMO this is the easiest to understand.",

If you scroll through this sub, I suggest you look for some heavily downvoted comments that are pretty long and seem to know what they're talking about. Those contrarian comments tend to be a bit less obvious/stupid than the top comments. Just go through the historical posts in this sub, particularly in late 2022 or early 2023 and you'll see everyone thought the sky was falling, especially in March after the bank run.\n\n  \nNow about the great depression. I can guarantee you it won't happen, no matter how terrible Trump is. Think about this. COVID happened, a global lockdown, the most unprecedented event, and we turned out fine, not even a recession that rivals 2008. Do you think Trump's little show is worse than a global lockdown? No.\n\nYes the market will go back up after 1-2 years. It dropped in 2022, half because of the Fed raising rates at the fastest rate in more than 4 decades, half because everyone thought recession was imminent in late 2022. \n\nHere's what generally happens during SP500 correction/bear markets in the past. A -10% correction happens every year, typically associated with some scares of the future, or just negative news. A -20% bear market is typically pricing in an imminent recession. A -25% to -30% is typically what a full fledge recession, and a -40 to -50% is associated with the worst recessions. \n\nNow historically, market has always typically peaked shortly before recessions begin, maybe 1-3 months prior. People are not saying recession is imminent. They are saying if Trump continues with his reciprocal tariffs with VAT, raising AGGREGATE tariffs to 25% across the board, then the US has about a 40% risk of going into a recession in the future, more likely next year than this year (the lowest recession risk is 15% in ANY year).\n\nSo if you're worried about recession risk, worry about them next year. We're not even close to going into a recession right now. You can just watch any economist on bloomberg and they'll say the same : risk of recession 12 months from now, but not imminent, and ONLY IF trump tariffs hold for 12+ months.",

It showed that even during times of natural calamity, the economy can still find a way to \u201cgrow\u201d.\n\nExcept the latter didn\u2019t happen for the other 90% of the economy. Not naturally at least. We are now dealing with a restrictive fed. Inflation is not going anywhere soon and we will likely not see stimulus coming from this administration because they *do not care about poor people*. The unemployment this time won\u2019t be essentially made redundant by free money. The unemployed this time will simply fail to consume past whatever meager UI they get from their state and that\u2019s it.",

We can already see that they do have some pull on him, since he's already toning down on the DOGE firing. Even on the tariffs, Bessent has said that early june is the deadline for implementation, implying there's room for reversals up until June, not April. All negotiating tactics right now imo.\n\nThe fed themselves will also support the economy as well. In 2022, the risk was that they won't support the economy due to inflation, but Powell has reiterated many times this year that the fed is ready to step in, and that he views the labor maket not as a source of inflation, which is really what the Fed was targeting.",

I think that gave people a mental crutch because it's like okay rates are going up I understand equities are falling \n\nThe last big one that got people really scared was 2008.  started getting the emotions going. This one is doing a similar thing because Trump is extremely divisive. I think a lot of very left leaning people are going to have a hard time trying to trade this market because their personal viewpoints are going to cloud their judgment unless they are just strictly trading models. \n\nThe one thing people have to keep in mind with these tariffs, which I'm not a fan of either to be fair, is the countries that are in the middle of the negotiations have more to lose than the United States does. Capital is flying all over the place right now for a variety of reasons but it's not really long-term direction. Trump also knows that if he throws us into a bear market and this gets away from him, the midterms are going to be a blowout. That will effectively end him and his legacy, this guy has a big ego.... So, is that likely? Probably not, Scott at Treasury is also extremely brilliant with markets. You don't get a job working directly under Soros unless you are tier 1\n\nI think the short version is a fairly accepted narrative that they want to drive down long-term rates. As that is taking place because let's be honest here, the data is softening really fast so our next CPI and PCE and unemployment, you should see a pretty good spike in TLT over the next 90 days All else equal. As this is going on he's going to be working deals with a variety of countries. Some of the tariffs will probably stay on, I think China is going to have a hard time. Europe Canada and Mexico, I think there's a really high likelihood that there will be some kind of deals that are beneficial to the United States more so than we currently expect. That's my base case, but, it could get away from him especially if countries start getting nationalistic and pride gets involved\n\nIf we get another wave of selling down to maybe the 520 530 area with really negative news headlines you're getting a gift to accumulate",

The whole idea behind these reciprocal tariffs is to force countries into better deals not keep them on indefinitely. If they start the tax policy or pass that while the tariffs are in place they have just created an economic bomb. \n\nIt may not take more than a few weeks to a few months to get these tariffs settled. If we can get on the other side of that and they have not began the tax policy and the deregulation, seems like a pretty good setup for the market at that point. People who are in cash, worried, we will probably be higher at that point but there's your green light\n\nPersonally I'm really not trying to take directional bets right now. Core long positions I keep because statistically you should, add on weakness, holding more bonds than I have in a long time, those slowly get sold to buy cheap equities. So basically if I'm wrong I do one thing, if I'm right I do another. I don't think anyone truly knows exactly how this is going to play out simply because there are so many moving pieces. How are these other countries going to react? Like you can sort of anticipated but it doesn't mean that's how it will go",

Fortunately, we had a pretty responsible Fed that responded in a manner that limited the damage. Like it or not, the \"soft landing\" that the Fed was hoping to achieve was largely accomplished because they took a pretty aggressive approach with interest rates to ensure inflation wouldn't get out of control.\n\nI'm not saying the market won't continue going up in a couple of years -- it very well could. The difference is that whatever economic and foreign policy decisions this administration is making today are not rational or even especially strategic. Bullying other countries with tariffs in a globalized economy where America is not the primary manufacturing powerhouse creates further inflationary pressures, and any potential return of manufacturing due to tariffs won't be realized for several years at the earliest. I think the general lack of strategy (i.e., chaos) is what should trouble investors the most.\n\nAll this said, the stock market has largely been detached from reality for the last 10+ years, so even if mortgage default rates increased tenfold and joblessness doubled, I don't know if the stock market would actually respond rationally anyway. The line could continue going up forever simply because the country is so rife with fraud and corruption now, too.",
