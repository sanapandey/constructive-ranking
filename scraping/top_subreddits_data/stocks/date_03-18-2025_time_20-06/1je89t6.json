    "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-17/germany-s-defense-splurge-is-said-to-favor-european-companies\n\n> European weapons manufacturers from Thyssenkrupp AG to BAE Systems Plc and smaller drone makers stand to gain the most from Germany\u2019s massive defense-spending splurge, according people familiar with the matter, after comments by President Donald Trump raised doubts about the US\u2019s commitment to transatlantic cooperation.\n> \n> At the top of Berlin\u2019s shopping list are six F127 battleships from Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems valued at more than \u20ac15 billion ($16.4 billion), and 20 added Eurofighter jets from BAE and its partners worth some \u20ac3 billion, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the procurement plans aren\u2019t public.\n> \n> The emphasis on European-made gear marks a departure from Germany\u2019s previous \u20ac100 billion splurge in 2022. A strong \u201cBuy American\u201d component in that debt-financed deal, orchestrated by outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, led to orders for 35 F-35 fighter jets, 60 Chinook transport helicopters made by Boeing Co. and Patriot air-defense systems.\n> \n> German lawmakers this week are expected to pass sweeping changes to the constitution that will remove borrowing restriction for defense spending in excess of 1% of gross domestic product, or roughly \u20ac45 billion ($49 billion). As most of the \u20ac100 billion from the special fund to modernize the Bundeswehr armed forces is either spent or earmarked, the new legislation will open the flood gates for additional defense procurement projects of unprecedented scale.\n> \n> European defense-focused stocks have been among the biggest gainers this year as governments make a more concerted push to increase their military budgets and seek to procure more from their home region. US arms shipments still make up the majority of exports to NATO countries, meaning Europe has to catch up if it wants to gain a bigger share of the investments.\n> \n> Germany\u2019s latest spending plans have been influenced by signs that the US will be a less-reliable partner in Europe\u2019s defense, after the returning US president briefly stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and threatened\n> not to help NATO allies if they don\u2019t spend more on defense. His close adviser, Elon Musk, has suggested exiting the post-World War security alliance.\n> \n> Germany\u2019s defense ministry is poised to start negotiations with Thyssenkrupp Marine to buy six more of the next-generation Fregatte 127 to replace three anti-aircraft frigates of the so-called Saxony class from 2035 onwards, according to the people.\n> The Thyssenkrupp unit formed a joint venture last year with domestic shipbuilder Naval Vessels L\u00fcrssen to pitch for the F127 order. The deal, which could even surpass the targeted price tag of \u20ac15 billion, is likely to be passed by budget lawmakers in the second half of this year, the people added.\n> \n> A defense ministry spokesman declined to comment.\n> \n> Another big order will be the purchase of 20 added Eurofighter jets in a contract worth up to \u20ac3 billion, the people said. The Eurofighter is made by a partnership led by Britain\u2019s BAE, Franco-German aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE and Italy\u2019s Leonardo SpA.\n> \n> Scholz announced the intention for the purchase in a speech at the Berlin air show in June 2024, but the order so far was not executed due to disagreements over spending priorities in the outgoing coalition.\n> \n> **Shifting Priorities**\n> \n> Some lawmakers had argued that Germany shouldn\u2019t invest too much in fighter jets, after the \u20ac10 billion purchase of the 35 Lockheed Martin Corp. F35s in 2022 ate up roughly one 10th of the first special fund.\n> \n> With budget constraints soon to be lifted, Berlin will now push ahead with the Eurofighter order to balance out its military procurement and put a bigger emphasis on European manufacturers, the people said. In 2020, Germany placed an order for 38 Eurofighter jets worth \u20ac5.5 billion.\n> \n> Germany also plans to invest several billion euros into the modernization of its military satellite infrastructure, the people said. One beneficiary could be OHB SE, the Bremen-based manufacturer that won a \u20ac2.1 billion German order last year.\n> \n> Other spending targets include hundred of millions of euros for artillery ammunition, according to the people, including by exercising options on existing contracts with Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall AG and others. Germany also plans more investments in air defense, after large parts of the first fund were spent to buy Iris-T systems from Bavaria-based Diehl, Patriot systems from the US and Arrow 3 from Israel and the US, the people added.\n> \n> Further billions of euros will be spend on more submarines and a yet to be developed drone strategy which will lead to various orders from German manufacturers like Helsing or Quantum Systems, the people said.",
