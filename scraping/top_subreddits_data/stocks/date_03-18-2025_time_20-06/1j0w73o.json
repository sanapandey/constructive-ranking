The company has a deal win rate of over 70% while competing in mission critical WMS industry. The company is also expanding into Omni channel enterprise software which expands their SAM. Biggest risk is the macro over the retail industry. \n\nIf the current environment turns into a recession, the company would still be a little overvalued, as their service revenue would drop further (they handle implementations internally as opposed to a company that outsources systems implementation like Oracle). I put money in the company, but am cautious about keeping my money there as I see attractive opportunities like Adobe or buying more of my favorite companies like ASML, MCO, GOOG, and SPGI at current valuations.",

Target is the middle and the middle is being eroded. Is the magnitude of the trade down sustainable? I don't know but I do think that the longer this trade down occurs and the more those people shop at WMT the more ingrained that becomes. How does Target compete against that? The primary thing is likely they have to compete on price, which is not great. Tariffs will be another issue. I would not be surprised if there is a new CEO sooner than later, but what can they really do?\n\nSo, I don't know. From my perspective, a problem I have with Target is that I look at the broader issues and I don't see it changing any time soon or easy answers to solve it.  That said, given what the stock has done and the situation as is at this point in time, how much of that is baked into the stock? It feels like the kind of thing where okay news could - at least temporarily - cause a nice rally. Any sort of improvement in the tariff situation could cause a rally. Of course, any material worsening of these situations (and if what's going on turns into more of a slowdown) could also cause further erosion.\n\n\"5k in SoFi\"\n\nI don't have anything against it really but I don't get the appeal. That said, I think the issue with JPM (and which will be more of an issue with something like SoFi) is that people view what's going on as a potential slowdown.\n\n\"all of them are down about 5%. So lost about 3k. It keeps going down. \"\n\nIt's a bummer that you're down but I think you have to look at it from the standpoint of given the market that we've had in a few weeks, a lot of people are down (I am, too) and how much are you down relative to your risk tolerance, goals, index, etc? The market has bad days, weeks, months and it's never fun by any means but it becomes if someone is very stressed by all this, then they have to make some changes in their portfolio (too much risk and/or too much money in the market.)  To me, this sort of situation where names are increasingly oversold, stuff down 20-30%+ in a month, sentiment horrible on a historic level is when you want to not be overly stressed by the market and instead look around and *gradually* start buying at least a bit of what everyone else is throwing out.",

I merely said that what they did to achieve their fantastic returns is the opposite of the advice that you\u2019re preaching. \n\nSecondly, I already knew the answer to my question, I simply posted that thread to see what the consensus was on this subreddit. If we\u2019re gonna judge each other by our Reddit posts then maybe you should consider investing in an accounting course. HOOD\u2019s accounting for the last quarter included an accrual reversal and deferred tax benefit which is why their earnings were inflated. \n\n\nAnd thirdly, investing data suggests that concentration, not diversification drives the greatest returns if you had bothered to do a little research you dimwit. Diversification merely reduces risk. \n\nHow dense are you?",
