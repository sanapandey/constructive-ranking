    "selftext": "Google\u00a0on Tuesday signed a\u00a0\u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d\u00a0to acquire Wiz, the New York-based cloud security startup, for $32 billion in an all-cash deal,\u00a0according to releases.\n\nThe deal, which will be Google\u2019s largest-ever acquisition, will improve its cloud security offering in a world of advancing artificial intelligence and cybersecurity threats. Wiz will become a part of the company\u2019s cloud business. Google said it expects to close the deal in 2026.\n\n\u201cGoogle Cloud is a leader in cloud infrastructure, with deep AI expertise and a track record of industry-leading security innovation,\u201d Google said in a release. \u201cBringing all this to Wiz will help make their solutions even better and more scalable, benefiting customers and partners across all major clouds.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition comes after\u00a0CNBC reported\u00a0in July that Wiz had walked away from a potential $23 billion acquisition by Google and announced to employees that it would pursue an initial public offering instead.\n\n\u201cSaying no to such humbling offers is tough,\u201d Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport wrote to employees in a July memo obtained by CNBC. At the time, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that Wiz walked away from the deal in part due to antitrust and investor concerns.\n\nBefore talks with Google were reported, Wiz had set its sights on two goals: an IPO and $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. In the memo at the time, Rappaport wrote that the company would pursue those milestones.\n\nWiz was founded in 2020 and has grown rapidly under Rappaport, with the company hitting\u00a0$100 million in annual recurring revenue\u00a0after just 18 months. The company\u2019s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response, a portfolio that\u2019s appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with\u00a0Microsoft, which also sells security software.\n\n\u201cBecoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company,\u201d Rappaport said in a\u00a0blog post Tuesday.\n\nGoogle has a long history in dealmaking and snatching up smaller companies to broaden its offerings to customers. Its largest deal before Wiz was the $12.5 billion acquisition of hardware marker Motorola in 2012. Two years later, the company sold some assets to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. Google has also made cybersecurity acquisitions in the past, paying\u00a0$5.4 billion for Mandiant\u00a0in\u00a02022.\n\nWiz\u2019s products will still work on competitor platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, the companies said. The Wall Street Journal first\u00a0reported Monday\u00a0that the companies were in advanced discussions.\n\nWhile the agreement may still draw government scrutiny, many on Wall Street have been hopeful that President Donald Trump\u2019s new White House administration will be more amenable to tech industry deals. Alphabet is currently battling an antitrust suit over\u00a0its online search dominance.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/google-to-acquire-cloud-security-startup-wiz-for-32-billion.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/google-to-acquire-cloud-security-startup-wiz-for-32-billion.html)",
