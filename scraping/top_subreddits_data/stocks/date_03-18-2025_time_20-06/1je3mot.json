    "selftext": "This post is in relation to Games Workshop (LON: GAW), the \\~\u00a34.66 billion (\\~$5.93B USD) tabletop gaming titan behind Warhammer.\n\nMy thesis: Warhammer\u2019s universe, intellectual property (IP) and ecosystem are worth *more* than GAW\u2019s current market cap *and* what Disney paid for Star Wars in 2012 ($4.05B, or $5.54B in 2025 dollars).\n\nI know this might sound bold. One can say that Warhammer\u2019s a niche , not a mainstream beast like Star Wars was. However, as someone that's been closely monitoring latest developments of Warhammer in social media and considering an almost 50 years of lore, a rabid fanbase, and catalysts like Henry Cavill\u2019s Amazon series, this could be a sleeper hit the market\u2019s undervaluing.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down.\n\nGAW is the king of tabletop wargaming, crafting Warhammer universes\u2014*40k* (grimdark sci-fi), *Age of Sigmar* (fantasy), and *The Old World* (retro fantasy). Founded in 1975 by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone with *Owl and Weasel*\u2014a newsletter that became *White Dwarf* in 1977\u2014it\u2019s been building lore for 50 years. Today, it\u2019s a \u00a3145/share stock with:\n\n* **Market Cap**: \u00a34.66B ($5.93B).\n* **Revenue (2024)**: \u00a3577.5M ($735M), up 15.6% CAGR over 5 years.\n* **Margins**: 71% gross, 41% operating, 30% net\u2014insanely efficient.\n* **Cash**: \u00a3125.8M, net debt negative (-\u00a379.4M).\n* **P/E**: 27.1\u2014pricey, but growth justifies it.\n\nWarhammer\u2019s niche: 1-2M players dropping $200-500/year on minis, paints, and books. It\u2019s not Disney\u2019s scale, but it\u2019s a moat\u2014high-margin, loyal, and sticky.\n\n# The Thesis: Warhammer\u2019s IP is worth more than $5.9B (and Star Wars\u2019 2012 Price). GAW\u2019s $5.9B cap reflects a tabletop business, but Warhammer\u2019s IP (its lore, brand, and potential) could fetch $9-10B if sold to a Disney/Amazon/Netflix. (*)\n\n*\\[\\*Edit: I am just trying to* ***value*** *WH's IP and $GAW, not saying I want it to be sold or anything.\\]*\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s a 50-year universe with untapped multimedia juice, and it\u2019s firing on all cylinders in 2025. Let\u2019s compare:\n\n* **Disney\u2019s Star Wars Deal**: $4.05B in 2012 ($5.54B today) got Lucasfilm\u2014six films, $4.4B box office, $20B in merchandise, 35 years of lore. Disney turned it into $12B+ by 2024.\n* **Warhammer Today**: No films (yet), but $735M revenue, 50 years of history and a lore deeper than Star Wars\u201410,000 years of *40k*, Chaos Gods, Space Marines, plus *Old World* nostalgia. Licensing\u2019s just $38M\u20145% of revenue\u2014but it\u2019s a powder keg.\n\n**Valuation Math**:\n\n* Core revenue ($735M) x 8 (media IP multiple) = $5.88B.\n* Licensing upside ($500M/year from films/TV, Star Wars-scale) x 5 = $2.5B.\n* 50-year brand premium = $1-2B.\n* **Total**: $9-10B\u2014above GAW\u2019s cap and Star Wars\u2019 2012 price.\n\nCrazy? Maybe. But Warhammer\u2019s fans are deep into it. Warhammer\u2019s got potential.\n\n# Why Now? 2025 is lighting up:\n\n1. **Warhammer 40k 10th Edition**:\n   * Launched June 2023, drove 10.8% core revenue growth in 2024 ($490M). Half-year to Dec 2024: 16.4% up ($307.5M).\n   * X buzz (Q1 2025): \u201cwarhammer\" traffic\u2019s 12-15M/month, up 10-20% from Q4 2024.\n   * Potential: $75M/year growth through 2026.\n2. **Henry Cavill\u2019s Amazon Series**:\n   * Deal locked Dec 2024: Cavill stars/produces a *40k* cinematic universe.\n   * Licensing ($38M now) could double to $76M by 2027, with $40M+ indirect sales if 200K newbies buy armies.\n3. **The Old World Resurgence**:\n   * Jan 2024 launch, new faction drops (and rumours regarding Cathay).\n   * People +30 are getting back to Warhammer. Veterans spending $50-250/army per year\n4. **Hachette\u2019s Combat Patrol**:\n   * Launched Sept 2024 (UK), Jan 2025 (Spain via Salvat). Weekly mag with minis hooks newbies.\n   * Launched in US too.\n\n# Warhammer vs. Star Wars?\n\nWarhammer\u2019s no Star Wars, yet. Star Wars had mass appeal; Warhammer\u2019s a cult with 1-2M players. But:\n\n* **Lore**: 50 years, denser than Star Wars\u2019 35 in 2012. *Black Library* churns 20+ novels/year\u2014*Horus Heresy* alone is 60+ books.\n* **Fanbase**: Smaller but fanatic\u2014players co-create (painting, campaigns). Star Wars sold toys; Warhammer sells a lifestyle.\n* **Upside**: Star Wars had films in the can; Warhammer\u2019s a blank slate. Cavill\u2019s series could be its *Force Awakens*.\n\nSome say Warhammer's too niche. I say it has a potential future mass craze.\n\n$9-10B is what a buyer pays for potential, not just today\u2019s market cap.\n\n* **Now**: \u00a3145, P/E 27, 4.2% dividend yield. Fair value: \u00a3150-160 (EPS $5.35 to $6).\n* **Bull Case**: Revenue hits $850M by 2027 (Cavill, *Old World*), EPS $9, P/E 25 = \u00a3225\u201450% upside.\n* **Buyout**: A $9B bid spins the IP to Amazon, triples licensing in 5 years.\n\nRisks? Cavill flops, *Old World* fades\u2014growth slows to 5%, stock stalls at \u00a3150. But GAW\u2019s 67% ROIC and monopoly scream resilience IMO.\n\n# Thank you in advance for your feedback on my comparison of Warhammer to Star Wars.\n\nBest.",

            "body": "**BEAR CASE TO YOUR BULL CASE**\n\nRealistically, i don't see anyone buying GAW for $9-$10 billion. In terms of return on investment it doesn't make sense. Right now GAW currently has an operating income of \u00a3200/$259 million. It would take 35 years for any ROI. Say with Disney's economies of scale, that drops to 25 years? Still too much. Disny bought Star Wars for just over $4 billion and disclosed it made $12 billion by the endo of 2023. That's an ROI of 200% (about 10% CAGR). All things being equal, Star Wars had a PE of about 4 at the time of acquisition (assuming \\~$1 billion earnings per year). Even with all the new Warhammer things going on, what's their operating income in 3 years? $300? $350?\n\nYou can argue that Disney made $12 billion because of the strategy they implemented. But Warhammer is much more niche. How many people play Warhammer? 2 million? 5 million? Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises in the world. Jedi Fallen Order sold 10 million copies. The Force Awaken is the 5th highest grossing movie of all time. No way does Disney spend more money or even the same amount, on Warhammer simply because Warhammer will never generate the same amount of money anually.\n\nStar Wars \\~ $1billion/year\n\nWarhammer \\~$250million/year\n\nEven if Disney buys Warhammer at $4b market price (which it won't) they'll have to at least quadrouple the income it generates for the investment to make sense. At best, Disney buys it for $2.5 billion. As far as growing the franchise, it's risky. Disney has to invest a lot of money behind movies, games, etc. The Force Awakens cost Disney 500 million to make and generated 2 billion in sales. Is there a world where that happens for Warhammer? No way. Never. Disney won't pour half a billion into a movie that isn't a huge franchise with guaranteed sales. Disney is just too big of a company to take risks like that. Warhammer just doesn't have the same fan base and it isn't even close. It's safe to assume that Disney's investment behind the world building in Warhammer will be substantially smaller than Star Wars. Therefore Star Wars is worth much more than Warhammer.\n\n  \nAll that said, I'd be glad to be proven wrong! \ud83d\ude01",

I'm somewhat of a nerd, play TTRPs, and have sunk countless hours into fantasy and space RPG video games and strategy games. I'm only vaguely aware of Warhammer 40k as a game with expensive miniatures and space orcs, and have never heard of Age of Sigmar, Old World, or anything else you mentioned. If I'm unfamiliar with it, I can't imagine that the average consumer is itching to consumer their content. Plus, Warhammer's name similarity with Warcraft, a game that also features people fighting orcs, is probably going to dilute brand recognition.\n\n\nIn comparison, everyone has heard of Star Wars. Kids love it in particular, and kids drive sales of toys and merchandise.",
