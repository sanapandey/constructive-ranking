I think others want better options for people that don't get secondary education. Again, somewhere that you can support a family without a college education.\n\nHowever, tarrifs don't bring back any of that. Conditions that don't exist like Europe and Asia being destroyed by decades of war, strong unions, and the emergence of new markets bring those conditions back.\n\nBut it's an easy buzz word to say to people. And it's a \"simple\" solution to a complex problem even if it isn't a solution at all",

                            "body": "True, but car drivers, regardless of the car, generally don't care about climate change.  To make a real difference to our carbon footprint typically involves some sort of sacrifice.  Whether it be sacrifices in comfort, luxuries, or time.\n\nA bicycle or e-bike is like 5-10x more energy efficient than an EV, and about 15-30x more efficient than a typical gas car, while using about 3% of the materials.  Materials is something most people never consider in their footprint.  Mining causes huge environmental damage that impacts our planet's ability to sequester carbon.\n\nElectrified public transit is also greener than a personal EV.\n\nFor those that care about climate change... have you given up flying yet?  Flying, per seat, per mile, causes the global warming equivalent of driving a 25 mpg car 2.5 miles.  Want to take that 5000 mile flight, each way, with your partner for a week long trip?  That's the equivalent of the damage that driving the car 50,000 miles, or about 3.7 years of driving for the average American... in the span of a week.  And I imagine the people taking these trips are still driving their 13,500 miles for the year.\n\nOne could not take this flight and reduce their emissions by 50000 25 mpg miles, or they could pretend to drastically lower their footprint by switching their gas car to an electric and reduce their car emissions by about 30%-50% (depending on their electrical grid) while still doing 50k miles worth of warming from their flight.\n\nSo... how many people are willing to give up flying?  A thing humanity's really only been doing in large numbers since the 1970s, or about 55 years, with record flights being hit just about every year now.\n\nNot to toot my own horn... but I've given up flying, save for 5 once in a lifetime trips across the ocean (or less), some of which may come when planes are using greener energy.  That's 5 flights in what I hope to be another 40-45 years of life, so about one every 8-9 years.  Not perfect... but better than a lot of Westerners.\n\nHow many people that care about the environment lowered their HVAC this winter?  How many plan to raise it in the summer, or turn it off completely?\n\nHow many people stopped eating beef or significantly cut their intake?  One of the easiest things one can do while having a huge impact.\n\nHow many people conserve water, especially hot water?\n\nIn other words, a lot of people claim they care about the environment, right up until it comes time to making decisions to reduce their footprint.  Afterall, they deserve all the niceties of life... they've worked hard for them, they're entitled to them.\n\nYep, tell that to the average person living in India, whose footprint is about 10% of the average American.\n\nNorth America has been the highest global emitter on a per capita basis for nearly the past 150 straight years, and still is today, and is responsible for a massive chunk of the global emissions pumped into the atmosphere.\n\nWhen you see global warming, remember, we did that!",

Their public sector employees did.\u201d\u00a0\n\nYep... that happened.  I mean, name one other CEO who's so fucking stupid to tweet that crap?  The man didn't seem upset that he was personally tanking his company.  He seemed upset that he was overwhelmed with all the projects he's taken on.  Although, it's pretty clear he's not doing any work at SpaceX, Tesla, in government, or at any of his other companies.  He's sitting in his office playing video games and tweeting, while everyone else does his bidding.\n\nMaybe no one watched it, but I did; During his German AFD party speech (the far right fascist German party who are basically Nazis in all but name), he spouted some xenophobic nonsense and suggested that Germans should not feel guilty of the sins of their fathers... the Nazis...\n\nFor the record, no one blames current generation Germans for WWII or the Holocaust.  That doesn't mean Germany, the country responsible for it, doesn't owe amends and can simply forget their past.  It doesn't mean they shouldn't be doing everything they can to avoid it ever happening again.\n\nElon Musk may be a great showman, simply because he's an adult 13 year old who goes up on stage and touts ideas he just read in a book, saw in a tv show, or saw in a movie, as if his company will have them ready for launch within a year... all of them ... all of the products... one year... and socially awkward / easily swayable people buy into this bullshit no matter how far fetched.\n\nOtherwise, he's not a good engineer.  He's not a good inventor.  Not a good CEO.  Certainly some good innovations have come out of Tesla and SpaceX, but ONLY because they got a jump start in these industries (private rockets / electric cars) with huge government funding (not just from the US) to help support buying up all the talent.  SpaceX for instance is a huge employer of former NASA engineers.  Tesla bought up all the electrical/battery engineering talent during the recession when other companies were cutting back.  Even then, they almost went bankrupt in 2009 (bailed out by the US government), and then again in 2017 (bailed out by the Chinese government).\n\nSocially he's an idiot.  Politically he's ignorant as fuck.  The man has one of the worst god complexes I've ever seen.  Everyone whose spent time with him to write about him thinks he's completely devoid of empathy, and has a major case of narcissistic psychopathy.",

Dot plot being released and talk about monetary policy is what we're getting; QE vs QT.\n\nI'm guessing the dot plot shows they're still expecting 50 bps cuts for the year; in line with expectations.  They could potentially pause QT, but I don't think they will.  This sell off has been too orderly, and comes off like a normal run of the mill correction in an uptrend (during typical times), and seems to be signaling for a bottom.\n\nIn other words, no material changes from their prior meeting.\n\nThat would, IMO, initially be considered bearish as investors/companies want rate cuts and reductions in QT, if not QE.\n\nHowever, as the info is digested, it could be considered positive since it's signaling the FED isn't yet seeing any cause for panic.\n\nSo... maybe some chop for a few days around the bottom, maybe a re-testing of the bottom again or even going a bit lower, wiping out the Friday opEx holders, and then we finally see the bounce.  If it bounces through the major downtrend resistance line, then it's almost certainly going to be a short squeeze back up to the 50%-61.8% fib level, if not more.\n\nSPY also has two big gaps to fill.  One below at 551.48.  One above at 567.  I think we could see a drop to fill that bottom one before the rally.  While it's down there, maybe it takes the opportunity to fill gaps at 540, 536, and 533 before rebounding.  How would it get the momentum to do that?  Simple, a quick little squeeze to spike down and hit those levels.",

I don't see that happening.\n\nEveryone's looking for a rally, it's just a matter of when, how high, and how much you want to risk if you're an options trader in deciding timeline.  The shorter the expiration, the larger the opportunities to either win big or lose big.\n\nIn day trading terms, I'm looking for chop over the next few days.  My puts are for this week in hopes of a re-test of the bottom, so I'm taking on a lot of risk. Could certainly lose that bet, but offset it with a few calls to potentially cover the losses if it just goes straight up.  If it doesn't move... then I lose both.  \\*shudder\\*\n\nLonger term, once the rally starts, I'm only expecting it to last about 5-6 days, retracing to the 50% - 61.8% fib.

Insiders owned 696,065 shares (2.3%) when 2024 ended. Some of the share decrease is due to board members retiring (one had owned  nearly 93,000 shares but isn't an insider anymore) but included in those big share decreases is the CEO (who sold 45% of his shares, nearly 300,000 of them) and the EVP of Patient Access and Therapy Development (who sold 47% of his shares, nearly 47,000 shares).\n\nI had remained cautiously bullish on INSP as I believed the tech would continue to see strong demand and adoption even in the face of potentially decreasing cases of sleep apnea as obesity dropped from GLP-1s but this insider selling has given me second thoughts.",

The companies will work together to build custom AI systems using Nvidia accelerated compute platforms, including NVIDIA Omniverse with NVIDIA Cosmos, to train AI manufacturing models for optimizing GM's factory planning and robotics. GM will also use NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences. \"GM has enjoyed a longstanding partnership with NVIDIA, leveraging its GPUs across our operations,\" said Mary Barra, chair and CEO of General Motors.\n\n>\"AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship. By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.\" GM will use the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to create digital twins of assembly lines, allowing for virtual testing and production simulations to reduce downtime.\n\n>The effort will include training robotics platforms already in use for operations such as material handling and transport, along with precision welding, to increase manufacturing safety and efficiency. GM will also build next-generation vehicles on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX, based on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, and running the safety-certified NVIDIA DriveOS(TM) operating system. Delivering up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of high-performance compute, this in-vehicle computer can speed the development and deployment of safe AVs at scale.",

I could see validity to having some exposure to it via BTC/ETH in that 5% ballpark.\n\nMy previous suggestion is just what I would've told a younger version of myself. There was some wasted motion/time in trying to evaluate and chase individual gains and optimize portfolios.. The best path forward would've been focus on accumulating something representing the market (also true in crypto for me vs. chasing alt coins) and put forth additional effort on life, work, family and maximizing savings rate. Optimizing & hitting a big opportunity were not that important, especially with lower dollar figures. Striking out on any individual investments also just seems wasteful looking back. Warren Buffett: \"**Rule #1: Never lose money**. Rule #2: Never forget rule #1.\"\n\n10x'ing a $500 investment, while helpful, would be inconsistent/likely non-repeatable and not matter much in the grand scheme. Accumulating $100k and getting 10% returns for rest of life on it was a better focus for my time & efforts.\n\nJust spewing random thoughts I'd have given myself.

For them, it's basically a story of transitioning the business. They are a HVAC company. They used to do a lot more new builds and like single installs. \n\nHowever, they've been transitioning the business over the last few years, where they now do more like owner operator work. They come in and work with companies on how to lower power bills. They also get re-occurring revenue via like maintaince contracts. This line of business also has way better margins. \n\nVCTR is kind of the same story with ARIS, where I was just looking to move some capital out of like infrastructure/data center stuff and get more diversified. Also bought some PLMR, which is a niche insurance company. \n\nI always try to be transparent here, but like this is one of my base screeners: [https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=fa\\_epsqoq\\_o5%2Cfa\\_peg\\_u2%2Cfa\\_quickratio\\_o1%2Cfa\\_roi\\_o10%2Cfa\\_salesqoq\\_o10&ft=2&o=industry](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=fa_epsqoq_o5%2Cfa_peg_u2%2Cfa_quickratio_o1%2Cfa_roi_o10%2Cfa_salesqoq_o10&ft=2&o=industry)\n\n  \nI call it base because I end up tweaking some stuff just time to time. Like right now I have sales revenue growth over 10%, but sometimes I lower it to 5% just to see if I can find new companies or like lower the revenue growth, but look at a higher EPS growth instead. Change up the ROIC sometimes, but usually start with that. \n\nAlso use [https://stockanalysis.com/](https://stockanalysis.com/), but you can share the screener parameters.",
