Even if they don't significantly increase defense spending (which they are already doing) the loss of trust in America means an inevitable shift away from US manufactured weapon systems to domestic ones. You don't just buy modern military systems and cease to rely on the supplier.

            "body": "The sentiment is unbelievable. As a German, I can see that there is a broad consensus among more than 2/3 of politicians (left-wing progressives as well as conservative\ntraditionallists) and the population that the Russians are a real threat to Europe. A majority assumes that Putin will invade the EU in the next few years and bomb it if Ukraine does not win this war. The first statement of the next chancellor was \"Ukraine MUST win this war\". Trump's line that he is talking to Putin at all is viewed highly critically. Pessimists and hardliners even expect Trump to launch a military attack on the EU, specifically on Denmark (Greenland). The massive rearmament hits a sweet spot and consensus between old traditionalists and military friends who have always wanted a better Bundeswehr and former hippies and Greens who were still promoting disarming with election posters two years ago. They stand up at the microphone and say that our left society must be defended with weapons. \"From today's perspective, I wouldn't refuse to do military service again\" quote from former Parzifists and the old guard is of the same opinion. In addition, Rheinmetall wants to use the facilities of the suffering VW plants and automotive suppliers for tank production and people who lose their jobs in the automotive sector are to manufacture weapons. There are \"Buy Europe\" movements etc.\nPoliticians are considering having people donate portions of their private savings to the war effort, and stocks are creating a new stock hype. Only 10 percent of Germans own stocks, and some are starting to do so because of the arms industry. Buying Rheinmetall stocks as a matter of civic duty...\nThey relied on the defense and protection of the US/NATO, and now they're standing alone, and the \"German Angst\" kicks in, this time fear of the Russians and the US and the far right (often pro-Russian in Germany). Before the election, the coalition failed due to a \u20ac8 billion shortfall.\nMerz, who took office as chancellor with an austerity policy, and even before his inauguration, together with the old government, pushed through a \u20ac1 trillion debt package for defense and infrastructure, based on a consensus between the opposition and the incoming government. This would require amending the German constitution (requiring a two-thirds majority in parliament). The decision to request this was made on a weekend, just a day or two after the Zelensky-Trump scandal (and Vance's speech at the security conference for sharply criticizing Europe). This is the largest debt package in our history. While I can only partially understand this development, it couldn't be more momentum-driven.In the German stock forums and WSB Germany, you will be insulted as a traitor if you short Rheinmetall (\"our Rheiner\"), because it is not appropriate, even if you loose a nice chance to play a dip.",
