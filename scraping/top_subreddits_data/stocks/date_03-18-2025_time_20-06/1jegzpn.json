    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of posts about people that are invested in index funds in the United States that are talking about how they panic sold or how they\u2019re pulling everything out of their investments and putting it into cash.\n\nJust wondering how many of you agree that this goes against the philosophy of staying the course and think this is stupid?  Besides the fact that selling can have a tax implication if you\u2019re in a brokerage, in my brain, this is timing the market.\n\nIf everybody thinks something is going to happen, does that not mean the thing is in someways also priced in?   No doubt in my mind that the stupid shit that Trump is doing is going to cause more dips and a lot more red days.\n\nBut people pulling their investments out into cash right now are panic selling in my mind.  The only thing that happens when people panic cell is the wealthy buy those stocks at a discount.\n\nIf I was sitting on individual stocks then yeah I\u2019d be a lot worried.  But I\u2019m very broadly diversified.  I actually threw a chunk in last week and am scruffy buying the dip.\n\nThe amount of people screaming \u201cit\u2019s different this time\u201d and the number of top comments being like \u201cglad I sold everything and go out when I did\u201d are really shocking. I think this is what is talked about when people say the words \u201cpanic selling\u201d.  The fact that so many people are saying this in the market is being driven by extreme fear makes me feel like there may be a degree of mass hysteria happening.\n\nAnybody on the same page or have any other thoughts?  I thought the entire philosophical point of things like index investing as a retail investor was to stay the course and not just do something crazy if there\u2019s a dip.",

If I\u2019m long term I don\u2019t really care about who\u2019s selling right now. If I can afford to buy more I do, if I am being financially effected right now or think I will soon I may turn down or off my current scheduled investments.\n\nAnd if I\u2019m more a of short term gains kind if guy and feeling like selling because I\u2019m up and don\u2019t like the way things are looking then I\u2019ll sell and get back in later. And that\u2019s ok. I had a few thousand invested through an app called stash. It wasn\u2019t much and I was up a little over 1,000$ and only had the app around a year. I sold the first weekend trump was talking about tariffs on Monday. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the right move, not saying everyone should have did it. I just didn\u2019t want to lose the gains, it wasn\u2019t a really long term thing for me and was just kind of fun. And I\u2019m happy with the decision. I wanted the cash so I took. If it becomes stressful there is a good chance you are taking the wrong approach.",

Odds are good that we\u2019ll recover back to these levels 5 years from now, even the US crashes out into a full on recession.

Travel to the country, and all of the wealth that it brings in, is cratering because tourists don't want to worry about ICE grabbing them. People in countries all around the world are literally boycotting our products in favor of nationalist \"buy local\" movements.\n\nAnd if he goes full authoritarian and does all of this on a much broader scale, the stock market is never recovering. Literally never. That ego ruler shit is cancer for a healthy economy. The smart money will eventually, over time, draw down their investments in favor of more stable, predictable markets.\n\n\"DCA\", \"buy VOO and hold\", that stuff is cute but it only makes sense in a stable democracy.

There is a lot of uncertainty right now.\n\n>  No doubt in my mind that the stupid shit that Trump is doing is going to cause more dips and a lot more red days. \n\nMore dips and a lot more red days would mean that the full risk is yet to be realized and is, thus, not priced in. Were it properly priced in we would have seen a much bigger drop. As it is, stocks are still up as of a year ago.\n\n> But people pulling their investments out into cash right now are panic selling in my mind.\n\nSeeing a market downturn and expecting a lot more red days does not seem like panic selling to me. If the market is currently overbought and one expects headwinds, it seems prudent to move into cash and wait things out until they stabilize.\n\n>  The only thing that happens when people panic cell is the wealthy buy those stocks at a discount. \n\nThat's a big assumption. Are these stocks really discounted at the moment or are they still overbought?\n\n> If I was sitting on individual stocks then yeah I\u2019d be a lot worried. But I\u2019m very broadly diversified.\n\nIt all depends on what you mean by \"diversified\". Are you branching out into other markets? FTSE? The Nikkei? The popularity of index investing has caused index investing to be the opposite of diversification since all participants are taking on the risk with the same basket of stocks.\n\n> I actually threw a chunk in last week and am scruffy buying the dip.\n\nThat seems like market timing to me. How do you know this is a \"dip\" and not the start of a bear market? A better question would be - are the stocks you're buying undervalued? Or are they overpriced considering the underlying fundamentals?\n\n>  I thought the entire philosophical point of things like index investing as a retail investor was to stay the course and not just do something crazy if there\u2019s a dip.\n\n\"Staying the course\" is not without risk. Take a look at the NASDAQ Composite. It peaked in early 2000 and then only reached that same level again 15 years later in 2015. Someone who \"panic sold\" during the \"dip\" that followed after the peak and invested it in US Treasuries, for example, would have made more money than someone who \"stayed the course\".",

We\u2019re about 1 million in 401(k) and I have 120k sitting in a high interest bank account. A week before the election I sold my PLTR stock at 43.50\u2026 2K shares (20$ price point) two reasons, I was certainly not expecting their profits to be as high as they were and I believed it was way overvalued. Second reason was because I expected a shit storm from the election. Yes it was gut wrenching watching it run up to 120 but now she\u2019s back at 82, still sucks but\u2026 Hindsight, ain\u2019t a grand. We also pull my wife\u2019s investments in her 401(k), we had 30% following the Dow and 30% in the NASDAQ and sat it all on the sideline. Since she works for the government were able to see what we sold at and what they reside at at the moment. Right now we\u2019re ahead on the Dow and well ahead of the NASDAQ and we continue to sit out. Sure I have some anxiety when I kept watching the market go up with the Trump bump \u2026 But I also pulled out of the market in January 2020, for the life of me, I couldn\u2019t understand why the market kept going up but then February showed up\u2026! SMH\n\nWill I miss some gains if I don\u2019t get back in at a decent time\u2026? Maybe, but I don\u2019t even think the real shit has hit the fan yet! Am I concerned about Social Security? Sure, but I\u2019m more concerned about the dollar! I\u2019m not a believer in bitcoin\u2026 I just don\u2019t see any value with it, It\u2019s not like gold or silver that serves a use, but with Trump in his fetish to be all about himself, I worry about him sacrificing the dollar for bitcoin. My understanding is Russia is now using bitcoin for financial transactions between China and India\u2026 Bitcoin is a sure off-ramp to the dollar!\n\nAnyway, this is just an old man\u2019s rambling\u2026 If I was young (under 35-40) without a whole lot of money at risk, I would stay in the market, but at 65, I just can\u2019t risk it! I hope the best for everyone involved\u2026 Just pay attention!",

When that happens, and it will, it\u2019s just a question of when, you get smacked on both sides. Margins and valuation compression.

You have to ask yourself whether you want to change your investment strategy based on new information and a change in conditions.\n\nAs a personal example, I\u2019ve had most of my investments in the S&P500 the last decade or so. It\u2019s been great for returns. But do I really think that given the economic situation in the US that the S&P 500 is going ti continue to outperform other markets with gains far above historical averages? For me it makes sense to reallocate which I have done, moving money into world markets ex-US, the EU, dividend stocks, and short term bonds as a cash proxy with better returns. \n\nInvesting isn\u2019t easy and in general staying invested is the move considering that markets historically have mostly gone up. But we have a fairly unique situation with a president and cabinet that is at best, economically illiterate. Attacking out largest trading partners and allies, alienating global customers, in the process of reckless break government. It\u2019s already impacting many American companies and they show no sign of any sort of coherent or stable strategy.\n\nSure, at some point there is a good chance the US market and American businesses will recover, but that can take decades to multiple decades looking at what has happened historically. Given the risk and uncertainty, rebalancing your portfolio to modify your investment strategy to fit your outlook on where we are headed in the short to medium term is just sensible. \n\nYou also can\u2019t buy dips if you are fully invested. It isn\u2019t about exiting the market at the perfect all time high or buying at the bottom, it\u2019s about limiting losses and spreading out risk as you renewer the market. Is that timing? You could look at it that way, but it\u2019s a valid strategy. If your strategy is to wait it out and stay fully invested, I get that. It\u2019s a valid strategy as well. \n\nOf course everyone thinks their strategy is the best, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be implementing it, but only time will tell, and no one truly knows the future.

Any sort of hiccup will bring the stock down at least 40-50% from these levels.  FSD still probably will get delayed, sales hurdles with no one wanting to own the brand with Elon at the helm, board not doing anything about Elon, etc.   So many things can and will be factored in. \n\nI still have my $500 a day drip into my 6 fund portfolio but I\u2019ll add more per day if we drop down another 20% or so from here.

Ignoring risk when the market is flying high doesn\u2019t make it go away.\n\nSecondly, if the bond market starts to collapse, the pressure on Trump from the people who actually run the global economy will be enormous. Now, I\u2019m not 100% convinced that this bat shit insane dictator can be controlled by anyone, but there are forces much more powerful than Congress that will step in. This quote by James Carville, Clinton\u2019s chief strategist, sums it up well:\n\n>I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a . 400 baseball hitter.
