While not as influential as Detroit or Geneva, Vancouver\u2019s show reflects broader industry trends, particularly in EV adoption and sustainability. \n\nThis year\u2019s edition is sure to court controversy, with Tesla\u2019s aforementioned removal from the lineup over safety concerns \u2014 underscoring tensions between regulators and automakers.\n",
