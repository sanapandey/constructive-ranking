    "selftext": "\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/ram-owner-wants-to-bring-cheaper-pickup-back-to-us-cfo-says\n\nStellantis NV thinks there\u2019s still demand for an affordable version of its Ram 1500 pickup truck in the US market after the stripped-down \u201cRam Classic\u201d ceased production last year, Chief Financial Officer Doug Ostermann said.\n\n\u201cWe need to introduce kind of a lower-end trim of the new pickup to fill that gap,\u201d Ostermann said at a Wolfe Research conference on Tuesday, cautioning that it would not come to market \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nDodge Ram is owned by Stellantis NV, a multinational automotive corporation formed on January 16, 2021, following the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the French PSA Group (Peugeot). This merger created Stellantis, which now oversees a vast portfolio of brands, including Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat, and Peugeot.\n\nIn 2024, Stellantis faced significant challenges, including a sharp decline in U.S. sales, leading to a 16% drop despite overall market growth. \n\nThis downturn was partly attributed to aggressive cost-cutting measures under CEO Carlos Tavares, such as reducing popular Jeep models, which some believed harmed long-term demand. These strategies led to internal disagreements, culminating in Tavares\u2019s abrupt resignation in December 2024.  \ufffc \n\nAdditionally, labor tensions escalated when Stellantis filed a federal lawsuit against the United Auto Workers (UAW), alleging violations of their contract due to strike threats.  \n\nIn 2025, Stellantis unveiled plans to revitalize the Dodge brand lineup and detailed a strategy emphasizing increased marketing expenditures, competitive incentive programs, and the introduction of more affordable vehicle trims.",

It\u2019s amazing for city driving and they retain their value like crazy. Also if you hit a human being they won\u2019t roll under it and die. \n\nhttps://www.carvana.com/cars/ford-maverick?utm_source=google&utm_medium=sem_nb&utm_term=1&utm_campaign=14682631644&utm_content=136567738305&utm_target=kwd-1571079829428&utm_creative=681571544354&utm_device=m&utm_adposition=&utm_rollup=1&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADdUw5ol4TxgEmHIun_T2CAzkxx_a&gclid=Cj0KCQjws-S-BhD2ARIsALssG0ZaIs84Uv6yMAAFgu9jaRfnbmRqnioZsv3HmAClw8osvZ1YBE3p8fEaAvy9EALw_wcB",

Used car prices way up, but have taken a drop lately.\n\nNew Trucks are now around the price of what a luxury car used to be. \n\nAuto loan delinquencies are way up. As somewhat of a luxury vehicle, pickup trucks that have been worn as a status symbol will be the first to fall. Who can afford them? Nobody is using them to haul shit, they're not needed. People will move back to sedans or hatchbacks.\n\nThis news reads to me as 'we can't sell RAM trucks - how do we fix this?'",
