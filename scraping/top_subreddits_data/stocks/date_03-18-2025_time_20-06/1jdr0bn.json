    "selftext": "shares of RDDT spiked +15% after Reuters posted an article saying Reddit will be expanding its partnership with Google. The article contained no new information and referenced a deal the companies made a year ago, framing it as a new deal. Within minutes major news websites all over the internet were parroting the reuters article in exact copy/pastes. And within minutes, the share price of RDDT spiked and then fell back to the levels it was trading at before. The articles stayed up for an hour or two and are being scrubbed from the internet as i type this. \n\nMy questions: \n\nWho will be held accountable for this and through what mechanism? Guaranteed a lot of money changed hands in this debacle. Who will be suing Reuters? Will there be a class action suit? ",

Then you have a bunch of Reddit haters  on Stocktwits hating away, saying there is insider selling during the pump and dump (if that what it was) yesterday. That is an easy lawsuit for a law firm like Pomerantz. And believe me they will sue. I would volunteer to be the lead plaintif of any law suit. I'm not sure if its just the management team at Reddit that are to blame, or Reuters.\n\nWhat do you think?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)",
