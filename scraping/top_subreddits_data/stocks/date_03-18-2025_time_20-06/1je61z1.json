Musk\u2019s political stance and federal cuts hurt Tesla\u2019s brand and sales. JPMorgan slashed its price target, and market fears over Trump\u2019s tariffs worsened the decline.",

Ya I could have made great money on Tesla then but my potential was not the high of 480 that it reached a few months ago. Because I would have sold well before then. If I was the type of guy holding at 480 still, I would still be holding to this day as it fall. There are all kinds of investors that had bought low and never sold at 480 back in December. These are the type of people that will never sell and will ride it all the way back down till they have lost money.

There's zero sense in vandalizing someone else's car in this scenario. \n\nIf the CEO of some company offends you deeply in some way so you go kick your neighbor in the teeth because he has a product from the same company, is completely illogical to the highest level something can be illogical.",

Thats why they are not a dominant vehicle maker in any market they exist after more than 15 years of god tier marketing. They are the best, even though in every major EV market their share of consumers was dropping even before Elon went wild.  \n\nIn China, BDY came out with an EV that can fully charge in 5 minutes and is getting sold there for roughly 10k each as reported yesterday in Bloomberg. Plus, the AI system integrated in the vehicle comes with the car for free and is more advanced than Tesla\u2019s level 2 visual only detection system, which still fails basic recognition tests like driving in heavy fog, rain, or recognizing a painting of a street is not a street.  It also has trouble identifying the differences between bus lanes and normal lanes.  The Chinese market, Tesla\u2019s second largest market, is pretty much done for Tesla.  The primary locations buying all those Teslas were predominantly liberal. In fact, most of the American buyers were from the left. Elon has alienated most everyone actually interested in buying an EV.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even getting into the cost cutting issues like the Elmer\u2019s glue holding the bumper together causing a mass recall or the protests.
