    "selftext": "Edit (I can\u2019t change the title) - the Fed meeting is on Wednesday not tomorrow. \n\nIf there is an interest rate drop then we have bottomed and in for another bull run.\n\nThere is a prevailing theory, especially among the MAGA crowd, that Trump was playing 4D chess and tanking the market on purpose to get the Fed to drop rates, fulfilling a campaign promise and allowing Trump to refinance a large portion of the government debt at lower rates. I think most levelheaded investors don\u2019t thing this is true. While I don\u2019t agree with the hypothesis, we know that short-term moves in the market are generally not based on fundamentals. \n\nI also think that if Powell (edited) doesn\u2019t drop rates (which is the expectation) then the next social media post that Trump makes will be something along the lines of \u201cPowell needs to be fired\u201d and that will add more uncertainty to the market. If anything, we mostly like Powell because he\u2019s been so transparent. Do we know what a Trump appointed Fed chair would do?\n\nEdit - in case I wasn\u2019t clear enough. I don\u2019t think the Fed will drop rates. But I do think Trump will make a fuss about it and suggest firing Powell. And the toddler fit he will throw will tank the markets. \n\nWhat do you think?\n",

But that\u2019s beside the point.\u00a0\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred guage is PCE *because* the Fed is reactive.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re leading us both right back to my initial point - you\u2019re not seeing it in the numbers yet but, production is slowed, and costs are increasing for manufacturers.\u00a0\n\nWhen this hits the data, the Fed may react by lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy which would lead to inflation or else they\u00a0risk bringing the economy to a further halt by increasing rates to fight inflation.\u00a0\n\nI think Trump is hoping for a rate cut so the economy keeps moving along and borrowing money to pay inflated prices because of tariffs.\u00a0\n\nWhether or not he\u2019ll actually facilitate a manufacturing renewal here is the question. He seems more concerned with making a cut (in tariffs) off of imports than he seems serious about reshoring.\u00a0",

It makes no sense to blindly change things in our monetary policy when there are so many variables that can influence it. Especially when you have to balance out Fiscal policy effects. \n\nThe fed can lower rates and still be restrictive, lets say these round of tariffs turn out to be inflationary because consumption stays up - judging off retail sales miss today, there\u2019s an argument it isn\u2019t. In this scenario we would likely see the fed holding or even marginally decreasing.\n\nIf consumption tanks then we will most likely see a growth slowdown - which an argument can already be made based off sentiment. In this scenario we would most likely see a deeper cut. \n\nJust because the fed is cutting does not mean it will lead to more inflation. For anyone that says otherwise they are being speculative. You or I simply do not know. We can only use the information we are presented with and so far it supports the fed cutting within a stable economy. Contrary to the headlines, the core parts of our economy have been stable - it\u2019s sentiment that\u2019s causing uneasiness not the actual economy.",

The rich are funding the game Trump is playing.  \n\nTariffs only cost Americans about $5,000 a year.  That\u2019s nothing for the people who actually make a difference in the market.  The US only exports 11% of its GPD, of which 25% are consumer goods.  It\u2019s mostly oil, gas, gas turbines, and industrial supplies.  So even there is a full \u201cboycott\u201d of consumer goods (which there won\u2019t because a lot people will still buy an item if an equivalent product is not available) of 2% of GPD will hurt some businesses, most will not be affected.  These boycotts make headlines, but the US economy can\u2019t be taken down.  Too many companies are internationally connected and in the end, prices will rise, and some businesses will move manufacturing to the market they serve. I don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s actions, but he will find a way to keep the economy growing, again, the US is the largest economy in the world and global companies do not want to lose the American market.

I mean, the entire GOP has gotten down on their knees for him but that doesn't mean someone with a spine will fold as easily. If Trump replaces Powell with someone who does what Trump wants the rest of us get to experience what our grandparents and great grandparents did....a new great depression  for the masses.",
