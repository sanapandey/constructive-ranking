    "selftext": "The last Wii U game was released in 2023\n\nThe last 3DS game came out in 2023\n\nThe last Wii game came out in 2019\n\nThe last DS game came out in 2014\n\nThe last GameCube game came out in 2007 (not quite as impressive, but yeah)\n\n  \nNintendo certainly has a habit of keeping their consoles and handhelds alive well beyond their successor's launch date. The only exception being the GameCube cutoff just a year after the Wii's release. That was certainly understandable. And look at the Wii's longevity, last 13 years! Even the Wii U, which was lackluster lasted a hefty 11 years.\n\nAnyway... It took me a while to upgrade to the Switch, so I'm not sure when I'll get around to buying the Switch 2. Do you think we can expect the same with the Switch? I'm hearing talk that Metroid Prime 4 might get pushed to the S2. I'm hoping they'll do a dual release like with Twilight Princess in that case.",

Those were all third party games.\n\nWe already know Pokemon Z-A is out later this year, and Pokemon has traditionally been a console behind. B2W2 came out after the 3DS, and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon was on the 3DS after the Switch came out.\n\nI do not anticipate a long cross or previous gen support. First year or so and I think Nintendo will drop Switch support pretty soon after that.\n\nI think third parties will continue to support Switch, particularly for games that don't need the power boost like retro compilations. We're seeing similar things on PS4 where the RDR1 port and Marvel Vs Capcom compilation were put out on PS4 rather than PS5.",

The DS was originally pushed as a new idea that would exist alongside the GBA, and then swiftly took over their whole handheld market. The Switch was even originally positioned as a \"third pillar\" platform and that the Wii U and 3DS would both still be supported. We know how that turned out. It feels like right now they are trying to come off as though the Switch will still be supported, but Im not expecting any first party games for it after the first year of the Switch 2",
