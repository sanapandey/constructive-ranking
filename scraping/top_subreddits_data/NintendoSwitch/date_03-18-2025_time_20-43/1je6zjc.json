The new content may have changed this, but we don't know yet)\n- The numbered XC games use a semi-open world (large, open areas which you unlock in order during the main quest) whereas XCX has a large open world that you can access quite early\n- XC1-3 have a primarily fantasy focus, XCX has a sci-fi focus\n- the main story is signficantly \"weaker\" (in the numbered games, the main story is the focus of the game, in XCX it is basically just the framework for the exploration and has a \"just another, somewhat more important mission\"-feeling)\n- the focus in XCX lies in the side content\n- you can create your own character whereas in the numbered game you play as a specific character\n- the OST is quite different.",

Or, alternatively, you could see it as an easter egg. But there are no clear-cut, defintive connections to the mainline games whatsoever. One scene at the end with an easter egg you can use to justify and say it is all connected via the multiverse.!<",
