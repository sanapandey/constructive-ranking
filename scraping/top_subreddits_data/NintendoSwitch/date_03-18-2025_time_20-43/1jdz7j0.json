            "body": "Hello and sorry for long post but I want to add as much detail as I can. I have been facing the same issue with a lot of my pro controllers, where the left joystick feels like it gets unstuck from the center and kinda clicky. Also sometimes it does a drift lock. Its always the left joystick as it\u2019s the most used one (mainly playing Mario Kart 8 deluxe). Last time I took it for replacement cause it was within warranty, they have changed the way the warranty works. Before I just sent it back to the store I bought it from and they handled it. Now the procedure has changed and the client has to talk directly with Nintendo service (a company authorised by Nintendo in my country in Europe). So I took my controller to them and after their inspection they told me a plastic part inside was broken cause of bad use or could have fallen. They agreed to replace it with a new one out of good will and just a one time incident. I agreed as it could have possibly fell off sometime and it caused the issue. That happened like 2 months ago. So to today\u2019s problem, I had another spare pro controller also within warranty that I started using when I took the previous controller to them and I kept using till now. It started having the same issue. Left joystick feels unattached and clicky. This happening too much definitely means it\u2019s not due to a fall or something but rather me using too much force on the joystick? Thats not something that I can fix though. Also have read other posts on Reddit where people are facing similar issues. On most games it\u2019s not a big deal but with Mario kart is very annoying. So back to support, they called me back and told me that sounds like the previous issue and if it is broken again they won\u2019t fix it/replace it per Nintendo \u2018s warranty conditions even if it\u2019s a totally different controller bought from a different store than case #1. Am I being unreasonable to feel that this is terrible on their part? Is there a worldwide email/support I can contact Nintendo about my case if they end up refusing to do anything?",

Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo all use practically the same ALPS joysticks in their full size controllers.\n\nIf Nintendo has decided it's accidental damage, there's not much you can do but ask them to reconsider. Each region is run as it's own thing, so there is no higher worldwide support to reach out to.",

If it\u2019s repetitive then it\u2019s def not caused by a fall so it\u2019s just cause of use. Seems very unprofessional to not honor the warranty by something caused by use",

Whoever you're dealing with seems to be more sure that a second one having the same issue means that it's not a normal wear and tear issue. I can't being to say who's right or wrong, but that seems to be Nintendo's stance here. Nintendo would say that the warranty doesn't cover abuse or accidental damage, and right or wrong they seem to have decided this doesn't look like a normal warranty issue.",

I called the official support team and they said it SHIPS on release day, and my shipping is 3-9 business days. Does anyone know if Nintendo is pretty fast with these preorders and such or an I gonna have to buy one at target or smt if I wanna play this thing in a decent time? I literally took a week off work to grind the hell outta this game cause I've been addicted since 2015 and need that sweet sweet hit of giant Mecha beating the crap outta the native wildlife. My PTO starts on the 24th - 28th. Am I really possibly gonna get this game only 2-3 days before I go back to work?

            "body": "My Switch Lite recently bricked. I tried everything I read online to get it to work but it just won't turn on. When I looked up the cost of repair it's practically the cost of buying a new one.\n\nCan anyone recommend to me any potential fixes that involve opening the thing up that's doable but a not very advanced user?\n\nJust FYI, basically I tried everything with charging it and hitting various buttons to get it to turn on.\n\nWhen it died it was out of charge so I'm assuming the issue is it can't receive a charge. I checked and double checked the outlets and cables. They work just fine on my other devices. It's the console itself.\n\nAny ideas on what I can do?",

Then charge it overnight with the old changer.\n\nIf you start a repair with Nitnendo, I think it would be around $100 and they'll just send a replacement Switch back.",

As your thumb resting on the stick is bound to create some accidental inputs from time to time.",

If that's what it is, you might just have to check periodically. (I would edit your post/question to mention which EA games you are specifically talking about) You could check sub reddit's for the specific games you have, to see if anyone else has posted the same issue.\n\nWhile this is not EA, Rocket League servers went down for at least a day, around last spring, I think. It was a very rare occurrence. In the 7 years I've had Rocket League, there has maybe been two or three other times their servers were down for 1-3 hours. Sometimes stuff happens.",
