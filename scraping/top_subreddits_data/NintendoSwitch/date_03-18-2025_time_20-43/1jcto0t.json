    "selftext": "When you look at them side by side the difference is massive. People who point to the Switch hardware as to a reason ZA looks so bad need to look at Mario Odyssey.  New Donk City is amazing and full of life and the textures are great but then you look at ZA and just wonder what they're thinking? It feels like they actually put love into New Donk City in Mario Odyssey but Legends ZA feels so bland and everything feels copy pasted and low effort in comparison. For a game that's main draw and setting is the City you'd think they'd put a little more effort into it. \n\nMario Odysseys City is just one part of the entire game and looks decades further visually. Just trying to give some perspective and my thoughts, no hate! Feel free to share your own!\n",

HarmoKnight and Pocket Card Jockey aren't really my wheelhouse, but I've heard good things about both. Before that, Drill Dozer again looks great and is pretty good fun. And they did a bunch of games in Japan only before that, before and during Pokemania. \n\nLittle Town Hero is by no means their first venture beyond Pokemon, is my point. *However*, everything they put out besides Pokemon (including LTH) slots in neatly between the many MANY indie titles that exist nowadays. They are all lower budget titles - not bad at all, but not what you'd expect from the devs behind one of the biggest media franchises in the world.\n\nPeople have been calling Gamefreak an indie dev as a joke/meme for a bunch of years now, but looking at their track record besides Pokemon, they really are that.",

They were developing both of those games while the WiiU was a colossal failure, and even the 3DS while being a success, was not big enough to sustain them.\n\nIf anything, it's even more impressive that they decided to make sure these games would actually work and look well. Your point about TotK stands though, as they just kept making sure to work within the limitations of the Switch the best they could. So we have two extremes here and GameFreak would not be able to push out games even close in quality to Nintendo's, no matter if they were struggling or not.",

COD has basically been the same but mildly worse for over half a decade but sales don't dip. Diablo 4 sold more than Diablo 3 and 3 was the fastest-selling PC game up to that point in time.

It's that, if the technical work is exclusively handled by GameFreak, it would only be expected that GameFreak would be the one litigating over patents, the technical form of intellectual property. If Nintendo takes over at that, it means that they are connected and there's crossover whenever it's needed. \n\nI put quotes on \"correct\" because we don't know. None of us know how much influence each company has on the decision making, scheduling and evaluation of the quality of the product. Y'all *guess* it is exclusively on GameFreak, since it's labeled as the development studio, and that's too much of a flimsy position to be pedantic over.\n\nIt's also pointless, because if loads of people dunk on Nintendo over Pok\u00e9mon, GameFreak will get to know anyway. It's not like they can be like \"phew! thank goodness they missed the actual studio, now we don't gotta do anything about it\". That's not how PR works.

You can clearly tell how much effort they put into new donk city, whereas it feels to me like gamefreak have been reusing the same assets and buldings since sword and shield. There\u2018s absolutely no atmosphere and the lighting looks boring the unambitious.\n\nI\u2018m not saying they should get a different team and think it\u2018s cool that they seem to be kind of loyal to their developers, but for the love of god, get someone who knows what they\u2018re doing to consult on those games. It\u2018s not like they wouldn\u2018t have the budget for that.\n\nI just finished playing okami, it\u2018s a 2017 remake of a 2007 action adventure game and i just kept thinking that that old game feels so much fresher than anything gamefreak did in this generation. You can clearly see the limitations that the okami devs were working with, but  nevertheless they managed to produce something memorable within those limitations. \n\nLike i said, at this point it\u2018s not even about the performance or battleimprovements anymore. It\u2018s about time gamefreak comes up with an actualy art direction, that makes one feel something!",

Especially the water in the clawncher scene of the trailer. Like it or not, this IS the best looking pokemon game. Like here\u2019s some key points that are actually addressed:\n\n1) the trees look far better then before, a key point of contention in the last few games\n\n2) the game has innovative xenoblade like mechanics for battle, which is already an improvement from S/V rigidness\n\n3) the buildings and character design feel a lot more pokemon then the models in S/V, so no uncanny valley feel\n\n4) frame rate in the trailer seems fairly solid, unlike the S/V trailer which showed chugging \n\n5) Seems a lot more emphasis is put on story given the older age rating compared to the other pokemon games.",
