    "selftext": "So first off, I've read quite a few people saying in google reviews that they thought 5 star reviews were fake cus they didn't understand the hype... which made me hesitant. But the more I research the more it seems like people genuinely do love these games and those people were just nuts. Is that accurate?\n\nSecondly, haven't played either one... does it matter which one I get first at all? Should I just pull the trigger and grab Kingdom first even though Sparks is more modern and looks really nice/polished? Both on sale but Kingdom is cheaper too.\n\nLast question - which one would be more fun/easier to understand for my 9 year old neice to play with me? She's usually likes games that kinda keep things moving (Mario Odyssey/Kirby/Mario Kart), not so much stuff like Mario RPG (but it's been a few years since I let her try it). So any ideas if this would be her pace?\n\nAppreciate any info!",

Everyone was confused, but it proved itself to be an extremely high-quality game despite being a crossover with the Rabbids of all things. Second game kinda lost all that charm and magic going in imo. I liked it quite a bit, I still recommend it, but it's not as special as the 1st game since it's the 2nd one. People sorta knew what to expect. \n\nI don't think there should be a 3rd game at all, it's a series that's kinda already ran it's course with what it wanted to achieve.",

The game is very linear but every second is a joy, and there is one boss battle that was brilliant, crazy and laugh out loud funny.\n\nThe second, it went more expansive, this is not necessarily a bad thing. The open world / map has more light puzzle solving elements which is ok in principal, but feels you're typical Ubisoft busywork. The battles are probably the biggest let down, once you find a team you like playing as, you can just rinse and repeat the same strategy.\n\nHere is your curve ball, both games have low barriers to entry, if your niece has never played strategy games before, this is a nice intro to the genre. Kingdom Battle however has two player coop that unlocks in world one. This can make the strategic element less fustrating for new players to the genre.",

A puzzle to solve. A tactic to discover. The satisfying loop of failing once, then reworking your strategy based on what you learned.\n\nIn the second game, you can create a powerful combo in a dozen different ways, and most of them will work for just about any fight.

I only changed to keep it interesting.
