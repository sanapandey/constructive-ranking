I have added the following games to the list:\n\n\nBo Path of the Teal Lotus  \nDragon Marked for Death  \nGarlic  \nInfernax  \nJubilee  \nKaze and the Wild Masks   \nLone Fungus  \nMetroid Dread  \nN++  \nPanzer Paladin  \nRain World  \nRite  \nRocket Knight Adventures  \nSunblaze  \nSuper Meat Boy  \nSymphonia  \nThe End is Nigh  \nThe Messenger  \nToodee and Topdee  \nTooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair  \nWill You Snail  \n\n\n\nI love well made precision platformers. I\u2019ve beaten  \nBzzzt\nCeleste  \nElypse\nKatana Zero\nOri and the Blind Forest  \nOri and the Will of the Wisps  \n  \n  \nI tried The Lost Crown but the combat didn\u2019t really do it for me and the Sands of Time is one of my favorite games of all time.  \n\nIt can be a metroidvania like Ori, super linear like Elypse or level based like Bzzzt. Any other suggestions out there for similar games? I like them to be difficult.  \n\nIn Elypse you have to be super precise with your movement.  \n\nIn Bzzzt you have to be super precise AND fast due to having to complete a level in under a specified time to get the trophy.\n\nCeleste had the same as Elypse and decently paced AND had a wonderful story.  \n\nOri had a fantastic story, beautiful visuals, sounds, music and combat.  \n\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

It's on NSO and it's easily the best starting point both narratively and in terms of gameplay since it's like a nice medium between the traditional nonlinearity of a game like Super or Dread, and the more guided experience that ensures you won't be overwhelmed by the amount of freedom given to you, but not restrictive in the way a game like Fusion can be at times\n\nSamus Returns is also like, definitely one of the more difficult entries of the series imo. Part of it is due to limitations that always existed in Metroid 2's design, but there are things like the constant reliance on melee in combat, or some of the map design definitely feeling a bit cramped likely due to the limitations of the 3DS in general. Dread basically addressed all of these flaws though",
