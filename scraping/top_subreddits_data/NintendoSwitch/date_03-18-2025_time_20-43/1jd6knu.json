I hope yalls pillow is cold everytime you lay down to sleep :) and your favorite drink is always in your fridge at home. \n\n\nHallo everyone! \n\nI'm getting tired of playing all these games with daily tasks, and quests with barely any good story line. \n\nThe last time I remember fully enjoying games have been with really good storylines. \n\nThese games are the last games I've remember thoroughly enjoy playing. In fact I wish the game play was longer when I finished  them: \n\n- lake\n- little miss fortune \n- firewatch \n- life is strange (all of them except for the latest ones I've played) \n\nAny suggestions that are similar is very appreciated. \n\nThanks everyone in advanced\n",

I'm enjoying it but I'd be careful recommending it without a word of caution since it is on the brink of being overwhelming at times with how often you are jumping perspectives and how many science fiction genre elements/tropes there are crammed into this game. It does feel satisfying piecing it all out but its work to keep track of it all and put it together, there's just so many sources of exposition its easy to forget important elements as you are jumping around the story.",

Try to keep with it and the stories will start to connect and line up more, and make more sense. If you have read Catch 22, it's kinda like that.",

Two such\u00a0\"adjacent\" games that stand out for merging story with elements unique to interactive media are:\n\n* Disco Elysium. Pen an paper RPG meets point and click. Excellent setting and writing, deeply cynical. Low fantasy post-communist. Runs great handheld, apparently has issues docked.\n\n* 13 Sentinels. This is basically like Lost, the TV show, but as a game and with an actual planned ending. Scifi setting, schlocky storylines built on homages and tropes, Japanese teen protagonists but they keep the sleaze (notorious around such characters) mild at worst. Zero branching narrative means static content, but instead it lets you choose the read order of each character-centric chapter with careful gating, so every player's _context_ is different, and each reveal in the onion hits in a manner responsive to your read order choices. Nothing else has achieved this approach.",

I think I would say the worst spike in levels this way is at the end of XBC1, but overall I don't think it is so bad. However, each game is only the longer side (maybe this is what you were concerned about) asking for 50-60 hours to rush through the main story with the potential for many more hours if you enjoy side questing.\n\nAlso ignore the other comment about XBC2's story being garbage. It is a great story, albeit different than XBC1 (especially in initial tone).",

You are mostly correct in that the main part of the expansion pass is the *prequel* campaign 'Torna the Golden Country' which from a story experience is best best experienced either after the main XBC2 story or at the start of Chapter 7 (both stories start to spoil each other at that point so it generally makes sense to just save the DLC campaign until after you finish the main XBC2 story). However, the XBC2 expansions pass includes other in-game items/etc. which can smooth out the experience a bit. I'm trying to not spoil anything in general comments, DM me if you are curious and I'll give some extra details on that.\n\nNote that the XBC3 DLC (i.e. also an all inclusive expansion pass) is also as a separate campaign \"Future Redeemed\" that is the main draw of that expansion pass. That prequel campaign is very much intended to be played last out of everything. Purchasing the XBC3 expansion pass before beating XBC3 also provides some benefits similar to the XBC2 expansion pass, but I don't think the benefit of early purchasing is to the same extent as the XBC 2 expansion pass so I'll leave it yo you to decide when to get the XBC3 expansion pass (BUT YOU MUST GET IT).",

If you play normally, I think I found two difficulty spikes.\n\nIn a lot of ways the game respects your time. For side missions that are collect x of item, the game will mark it complete and give you exp without going back to the quest giver. For that reason, just talk to everyone and accept every quest, and you won't have to put too much effort into going out of your way to complete them.\n\nThings I didn't like.\n\n* There is a gem minigame for upgrading your weapons. How it actually works is a complete mystery so I was probably playing with slightly underpowered weapons.\n\n* Sidequests, there are loads of them but the game doesn't tell you which quest giver just wants you to kill a monster a certain number of times and which have story and plot. I found one side quest had voice acting and a whole scene animated. It looked like every other sidequest marker on the map. I think the sequels fix this, but it was annoying.\n\n* One particular difficulty spike in the last quarter of the game.\n\n* There is a city building side quest. This should be really fun, but the drop rates on some items needed to complete it are really low. You might find yourself grinding to complete this.\n\nI found it fun and I liked it. It also has the option of an easy difficulty if you just want to play for story. I must confess I played the added content on easy because after 100 hours I had my fill of the title and wasn't in the mood to play the epilogue for the challenge.\n\nI don't think you really need to go out of your way to grind for about 90% of the game, but as I said, accept every side quest as soon as it's available and you will find yourself completing them and getting exp anyway. Some bigger story based side quests are absolutely worth doing too.",

These are games that are made under the idea \u201cI have a great game design, here\u2019s a good story to go with it.\u201d As opposed to \u201cI have a story to tell, how can I tell it through game?\u201d\n\nI pretty much exclusively get games that are story driven and hope the gameplay follows suit.\n\n- Ministry of Broadcast: short platformer of post-apocalyptic dictatorships. Fun and short with a good story.\n- Sword of the Necromancer: thief + princess love story behind a roguelike. It\u2019s a game in two parts where the two parts are identical gameplay, but two stories on opposite sides of the relationship. Short and sweet if you put the right settings on.\n- Outer Wilds: best on another console for graphics but the storytelling is very well done\n- Life is Strange True Colors: I know you mentioned it but I wanted to list it in my games because I played and actually really liked it\n- Inscryption: a game in three acts with act one being absolutely phenomenal. The storytelling behind the game is very clever and really makes it a wonderful game, despite act 2 being a serious weak point.\n- Coffee Talk: you literally talk to people and occasionally make coffee. Still, the world building in this fantasy world is amazing and the character writing is soooo good. I hear there is a second one, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on switch\n- HOA: a platformer with no real challenge, but an adorable little story. Only a couple hours long and your heart will ache for the character at the end.\n- The Wild At Heart: a pikmin game about a kid running away to a magical forest. Great graphics, fair gameplay and a really heartfelt story\n- Sayonara Wild Hearts: a retro rhythm game that\u2019s just crazy gameplay with excellent storytelling. Very short game\n- Jenny LeClue: amazing detective story work, but it ends on a harsh cliffhanger to the point that I wouldn\u2019t even recommend it.\n\nBy the way, almost 100% of these games I got through my library, so I have no idea if they are worth their price tag.
