It's a handheld console that you can take with you, play in handheld, then when you arrive at home you can dock it, remove the controllers and play on the TV.\n\nSimple to understand and attractive as a concept, as well as useful on practice. Nothing like those Wii U trailers where it was never clear what even was the purpose of the Gamepad (Because not even Nintendo knew) or if it was even a new console at all.",

Honestly even back in the Wii U era you were better off just gaming on the 3DS if you wanted to play a game without a TV. An actual portable like the Switch or 3DS just works so much better. There\u2019s a reason the Wii U never caught on.",

Breath of the Wild was finished and could\u2019ve been released that year but they obviously didn\u2019t want to burn it.\n\nAt least with other slower years like 2018 and 2020 we still got stuff like Smash Ultimate and Animal Crossing New Horizons. 2016\u2019s premier titles were like Star Fox Zero and Paper Mario Color Splash lol. I guess the 3DS still got some good games that year, but everything for home console was being saved up for the Switch.\n\nThankfully 2017 was probably Nintendo\u2019s best year ever which makes up for it haha.",

I put almost 200 hours into it and never played another video game until finally in the Fall of 2018 I caved and bought a Switch with the Super Mario Party bundle to take a on cruise with friends. The even funnier joke is we never played the switch on the cruise...so I got back home and had this untouched system. Had my heart healed from Nintendo's reckless abandoned? A little. And so I began to play video games again...",

Found the kid whose first console was a Wii U.\n\nThere were a very small handful of games that used the GamePad well, mainly Nintendoland, Splatoon, and Mario Maker. The rest either used it as a map or menu of sorts, or else they shoehorned in something with it that generally didn\u2019t work. Remember how horribly Star Fox Zero turned out because it was built around the GamePad?\n\nYes the DS had used the dual screen gimmick, but that\u2019s part of the problem, the gimmick had already been played out. Most 3DS games by that point weren\u2019t using the touchscreen for much, most of the innovative ideas of it had already been used. Also now that we have smartphones, stuff like being able to write notes on the screen just isn\u2019t as useful when you can just put it in your notes app.\n\n13 million units vs. 150 million speaks for itself.",

Yes the hybridity between home and handheld is obviously a gimmick, but that hook has way more immediate appeal to the core gamer than basically anything about the GamePad, and the games shown were exactly the kinds that needed to be there to sell that it was Nintendo going back to basic and reorienting their focused demographics, which stood in stark contrast to how Wii U was only ever marketed towards very young children and families. Skyrim being there alone was pretty huge considering the dire state of Nintendo's relations with third parties at that time",

It was very easy to show \"here it is attached to your TV with the big screen, now here it is in hands on the go\". Plus, those two use cases are great for opening up the market more. Some people don't really like handheld and much prefer having a home console, some people are on the go a lot, or share a TV so they don't always have the ability to play on it, so handheld is great for them. \n\nAnd that \"click\" was such a perfect little marketing thing. It's so recognizable, and I feel like just after the original trailer it was already a very recognizable sound. \n\nPlus, definitely being able to open up by showing a game like Skyrim, saying \"hey, we'll be able to run these big console games on here\" (even if Skyrim was already 4-5 years old when the Switch was revealed) definitely helped show a use case for it. Handheld games that were a lot more like full console games now.",

Including a touch screen and motion controls was the right call because it allows the Switch to play a lot of past games from Nintendo\u2019s library (and sequels to said past games), but for everyone else who just wants to play it normally, they can do that.\n\nLike 98% of Switch games support a regular control scheme with a pro controller on the TV and normal controls for handheld mode. Gone are the days of Wii and Wii U where you had to read the box to see if it supported a regular controller, and even if it did you had to make sure you had the correct controller. Switch just plays games normally.",

I always wondered why Nintendo was so dead set on marketing the HD Rumble feature, when I could tell right off the bat that nobody was ever going to care about that.\n\nTouchscreen controls could have been demonstrated with a split-second shot of a player interacting with the system menu with a touch, and motion controls likewise could have been demonstrated with something like one of the motion control shrines in BotW moving in sync with a controller (unless they didn't want to reveal shrine interiors yet, idk).",

When I see monolith games, Zelda, Panic Button ports early on in the switch lifespan...no doubts.\n* simple/lightweight OS (maybe too simple, I'd have liked themes lol)\n* familiar controls...\n* Versatility: one console, one dock, 2 joycons (so up to 2 players)\n\nit's all about gaming and you can play any way you like: solo, couch lan, online..tabletop mode, docked, undocked.\n\nMore than a relief to see the switch 2 being a direct continuation, only this time with (rumored) MUCH more power and ML upscaling, because after 8 years, that underclocked Tegra X1 and those 4GB or shared ram are struggling to keep up for sure",
