There are six class paths (some classes are basically just continuations of other classes, so it works out to six in practice) and the party members use some combination of those. So, for example, Elma is an orthodox Full Metal Jaguar, using dual SMGs and dual swords, while Doug is a mix of a Galactic Knight and a Psycorruptor, using a lightsaber and a laser cannon. The player character can access these class combinations themselves eventually, it's sort of like the Final Fantasy job system.\n\nWhat *is* unique to each NPC is their two unique arts. You can learn those arts by doing their affinity missions. Plus most characters have an extra affinity mission to recruit them. So the four new characters means eight new arts and twelve new missions.",

I remember being astonished by the ambition of the game, and it was a miracle how they pulled off that game on the WiiU. Monolith Soft are wizards.\n\nThat migh come as a bit over the top, but I feel XCX is a proto-BOTW. I think XCX fits more in the current landscape than when it came out, as it was something really different to XC1. With much more focus on its open world, exploration and more barebones story (although the ending was fire, and I NEED to know what comes next).\n\nI think I'm gonna miss the gamepad in this replay though. Say what you want about the WiiU gamepad, but it was really convenient to navigation, fast travel and probes. Open a menu will be odd coming from the OG.\n\nEDIT: Also, I've said this before, and I won't spoil too much for people who don't played it yet (BUY IT), but one of the most memorable moment in gaming I had in my 34 years of gaming life, was getting a Skell, and realizing how masterfully this game is structured.",

Everything is mission based, so instead of walking into cutscene triggers to progress the plot, each story chapter after 2 starts at the BLADE base and is triggered whenever you're ready for it. It's a lot more gear based than Xenoblade 1, 2, or 3. There were fewer tutorials in the original version but I think they added some more for Quality of Life related reasons. That might mean the secret sauce to enjoying combat is probably going to be easier to figure out than Xenoblade 1, but you never know with that sort of thing.",

I couldn't get into any of the mainline 3 xenoblade games, but I'm obsessed with X.\n\nThe mainline Xenoblade games are more focused on story. XCX has a story and NPC characters, and it's fine, but it's not really as much of the focus. Like for example, the mainline 3 XC games have a protagonist that is a specific character, whereas XC gives you a character creator and has you playing a sorta \"blank\" hero like you would in a bethesda game.\n\nYou know how games like Skyrim and Fallout technically have a story, but you kinda don't care about it most of the time you're playing because you're out there exploring and getting up to sh\\*\\*? Well XCX is much more like that than the other games.\n\nXCX is more focused on gameplay, with a huge focus on exploration, and the world map is ENORMOUS. Bigger than BOTW, bigger than Skyrim, it's a very big place. You'll always be striving to push to the next place you can reach on the map to put down a new probe (which gains you xp and resources). Sometimes the next part of the map is hard to reach because the enemy heat is too high and you just need to get stronger, but sometimes it's because you lack the equipment (e.g. some areas you can't reach until you have flight).\n\nNone of the main 3 Xenoblade games have the mechs like X has. Once you advance to a certain stage of XCX, you gain access to a small mech which transforms into a sorta motorcycle for fast land traversal. Eventually you can upgrade to a bigger and stronger mech that can also fly. You definitely need the mechs to take on some of the biggest and strongest enemies in the game, some of which you may not even be strong enough to defeat until post-game. You'll be having a lot of mid-air DBZ battles in your flying mech lol. The mech customization and equipment customization is very deep. You'll choose 2 arm weapons, back weapons, handheld weapons, ranged or melee, armors, mech size... you can also choose to focus on a certain weapon TYPE such as ballistic or energy for example. Plus every equip in the game---both on yourself and on your mech---can have \"augment slots\" that allow you to slot augmentation gems to tweak the parameters even more or add bonus effects, so then you gotta think about what augments you might want. There is a lot to fiddle with.\n\nIf I remember, this is also the only Xenoblade game where characters just have straight up machine guns and assault rifles.\n\nThe other XC games have a small party 6 or so specific characters, whereas in XCX you can recruit and play with up to twenty something different characters. (They all gain XP, so you don't have to level them individually and can swap them as you like.)\n\nThere is also an asynchronous multiplayer element where you get put on a squad, and you help your squad achieve certain goals related to slaying baddies or hunting treasures. A new set of goals for your squad pops up every few hours, then the scores are tallied each day. Then you will have prizes available to you based on what rank your squad achieved. You get the prizes just by being on the team, whether you helped or not. If you played something like Pokemon GO, then you kinda have an idea of how this kinda system works. You can completely ignore this element of the game, but it can be a fun tangent, and it's a good way to try out your new equips and loadouts.\n\nAlso, besides the main quests, besides exploring, besides the online component, there is a sort of random quest board in the game where you can basically accept different contracts for different kinds of rewards, so you can also be grabbing and completing those as well for extra money and resources.\n\nIf you like exploring in games, wanna have superhuman speed, superhuman jump height, and definitely if you like mechs at all, it's worth giving a try. This game is much more of an RPG where you just go running around a huge open world and enjoy yourself doing whatever you want much more than the mainline 3.",

X is an open world game where you just run around a gigantic map getting up to any shenanigans your heart desires.

I like JRPGs mainly for the gameplay, so if they are too much about the anime and not enough about the gameplay, I tend to bounce off of them.\n\nTo the extent that I like the story and characters in XCX, to me it has more to do with the setting and the context than the actual plot. What actually happens plot-wise or with any individual character is not that interesting to me, but in terms of setting and context, I really enjoy that it's much more sci-fi than the other Xenoblades and is basically about a half-military, half-scientific project to explore, research, and map this alien planet that a bunch of space travelers crash landed on. So I really like what the idea is and the vibe that it has. I like some of the character aesthetics and personalities, but that's about as deep as it goes.\n\nFor me XCX is mainly about giving me the assignment to investigate an open world alien planet with different biomes, get my ass kicked by a bunch of different alien creatures, but then come back with better weapons for revenge, and of course the big robots. It's more about exploration, adventure, resources, equipment. I like the adventure of it.\n\nThe story parts are just a bit of flavor. They're fine.",

The series as a whole sorr of plays like a single player MMO RPG (think World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV). While the trilogy titles focus a lot more on story and character development, X focuses more on the \"MMO grind\", exploration, and tinkering with your party's composition (as there are 18+ different possible party members, with fully customizable mech suits unlocked later).",

Of the numbered games, XC:1's combat is my least favortie because of the limited options, particuarilly when it comes to chain attacks. Since you can't directly control when you're given another chain durring a chain attack, it feels a lot less meaningful than XC:2/3. \n\nX on the other hand, while it's base on-foot combat is the most similar to that of XC:1, provides a lot more options (particuarilly for the player created character), and the overdrive system (this games chain attack equivilent) is far far more interesting than XC:1's chain attack. \n\nOverdrive once understood, is one of the most abusable systems in any JRPG. You can effectively go infinite with overdrive if your build is setup correctly, allowing you to recharge arts faster than you can use them, which allows you to keep overdrive up for longer. It's a lovely dance once you figure out how to do it. \n\nBetween Overdrive, and skell (mech) combat, the game's combat is far far more inline with the depth of Xenobalde 2/3 than it is XC:1's, even if at first glance it's the most similar to that of XC:1's combat system (particuarilly at the start of the game).",
