The gameplay was stiff and the roster was pretty straightforward and boring, and I had a lot of trouble telling which players were bots and which were real humans. It\u2019s so basic that it reminds me more of the Overwatch 1 clones that were everywhere 6-9 years ago than it does other modern hero shooters. Its timing was particularly bad, Rivals took over the genre a few months later and it makes this game look like an absolute joke.",
