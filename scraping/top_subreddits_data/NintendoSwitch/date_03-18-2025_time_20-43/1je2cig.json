    "selftext": "First off, not here to discuss the validity of achievements (Such a spicy topic here), just simply tracking them for those people like myself who enjoy having them included in their Switch ports for completeness.\n\nDue to past confusion on the literal concept of achievements, I have narrowed it down now.  This list represents Switch ports with the same achievements found on Steam/XBoxLive/PSN viewable and unlockable somewhere ingame.  Completion lists or 100% trackers (Such as the LEGO games) while typically a component of a some games achievements, are not what I am keeping track of here.\n\nThis means Switch only games, even if they have things one would commonly view AS achievements, or even called achievements, have been omitted.  Multi platform only.  This was a matter of simplicity.\n\nThis is a continual, community effort so I cannot vouch for the accuracy of ALL games on the list.  I do take a lot of peoples word for additions.  \n\nNew to this update though is a simple + at the end of a game that denotes that I either personally own or have vetted the game via gameplay vids to confirm they contain their achievements.  No +, no guarantees.  If any nonconfirmed ones are able to be confirmed by you fine people though, feel free to let me know! \n\nHave any games I have missed to this list?  Let me know!  Previous attempts to edit on the fly absolutely broke the thread due to rapid fire edits so I am planning to just compile additions then add them all at once in chunks.

Having trophies adds arbitrary requirements that offer up more grind and potentially force you into playing the game in what feels like a very railroaded way requiring a guide.\n\nI think trophies are stupid personally but am not against their inclusion as I just ignore them. That said, I get both sides of the argument.",

I'm already trying to get any collectible I can find, or in the case of a Metroidvania, am obsessed with filling out every corner and nook and cranny of a map because of the satisfaction from seeing everything colored in and filled out. That's why I get so many games in genres like RPGs or open world stuff on PlayStation or games in general that have some sort of progress marker in-game.",

I think Metroid Prime Trilogy had the best use of in game achievements, and those I could actually enjoy. If people want them system wide cool, but I'd like a way to turn them off if they were to ever do that.\u00a0\n\n\nI think Nintendo is specifically wary of using them because of health reasons. They want people to engage in games in a fun more casual way. Anyone remember those 3ds messages that say 'it looks like you've been playing awhile don't forget to take breaks'\u00a0\n\n\nThey seem concerned, maybe overly so, with people not getting addicted to games and having it become a negative influence on a person's life.\u00a0",

Was just a blanket solution as it was devolving all the way down to \"doing anything in any game us achieving somewhere therefore it counts!\"\n\nHad to keep it more cut and dry or the sake of sanity.  Multi plat titles with the listed Steam/Platform achievements as they are",
