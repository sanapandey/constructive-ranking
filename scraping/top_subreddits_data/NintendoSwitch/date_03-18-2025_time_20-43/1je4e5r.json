While this is a basic feature of many RPGs, the original version instead asked you to memorize where every single character was within New LA and go talk to them in order to swap them in.\n\nThis was my biggest issue with the original, and I'm so glad to see it's been updated. I could never remember where characters were located to swap them out.",

When I played it on the Wii U, I ended up getting stuck in a spot around level 5 where I couldn't do any quests because I needed to be at least level 7 and my only option was to grind it out.  I bounced off of it then and never picked it back up but I was also new to the series back then.  Now with 1, 2, and 3 under my belt, I'm excited to give X another try.",

The rest of the series, Chronicles 1, 2, and 3 play similarly but are more traditional in their JRPG characteristics and have a stronger fantasy and philosophical narrative and are worth playing, but X holds a special place in my heart for being so different from anything Nintendo has done when it first released.",

The amount of freedom and \"rule of cool\" is also far less than that of X. \n\nConversely, X is one of the best exploration games that exist. The world being completely open from the start, and the addition of skells (mechs) add a level of freedom the other Xenoblade games don't even come close to.

XC:1's world for example is so rich in history and story telling. The main party is a delightful cast, and I quite enjoy their characters. But the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Between the limited combat options compared to the other games, to the irritating choice to bind chain attack continuation to party affinity, the game is far from unflawed. The game is still a masterpiece, and I love it dealy, but IMO X's combat, moment to moment exploration, and the side characters/ stories in X, are all far more compelling than that of XC:1.",

In fact a lot of the team that made X also helped Nintendo make the open air Zelda games (they have a whole team that just works on Zelda now because they were so helpful). The game features a great story too, but it\u2019s much more focused on exploration and side content.\n\nIf you prefer a linear story based game with one of the best stories in the history of gaming, go with 1 Definitive Edition. It\u2019s still got a huge world to explore and is pretty much an open world game too, you just have to progress through the story in order to unlock parts of the map. It\u2019s on the eShop as \u201cXenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition\u201d, check the release date for it (2020) so you don\u2019t get it confused with this game.\n\nXenoblade 1 has two sequels (each set in their own world with their own characters) and all of them also have story expansions. It\u2019s an amazing series to get into and now it\u2019s all on the Switch!",

Xenoblade is more akin to Final Fantasy, where each entry is entirely it's own thing. The parts of the story that overlap for XBC1 and 2 can be enjoyed in literally either order. XBC3 while totally fine on it's own, is greatly enhanced (especially the dlc) if you have played both XBC1&2. XBCX came out before XBC2 and it's entirely playable separately as doesn't have any tie ins story-wise to previous games. I say in it's original form because this remake has enhanced story content the way the remake of 1 did, and it's very likely the same enjoy in any order Easter egg from 1&2 will be confirmed in x.",

                    "body": "The environments are extremely alien/fantastical compared to any other open world on Switch, you'll see sights you haven't seen before in a game. These environments are appropriately filled (not sparse and Bokoblin-cloned like BOTW/TOTK but its also no Monster Hunter either) with a pretty big roster of alien species of various shapes and sizes, some of which even travel in herds of sorts and a few that are given neat (if not outright cute) animations showing them interacting with the environment in animalistic ways. There are also many collectibles littered across the map, but they're admittedly displayed as mere blue and red diamonds to run across in order to pick up (I can't remember exactly, but I *think* these items are given some flavor text in the menu at least). There are an okay amount of treasure chest-like containers and structures to find too. In general, these chests plus many of the aliens' corpses contain plenty of useful weapons and costumes (lots of fashion options in this game, or at least a fair amount).\n\nAll this being said, the game is mostly about explored uncharted territory in a wild alien planet, NPCs are very sparse (although not nonexistent) in the outside world and mostly confined to the hub area. The hub is a city which is significantly bigger and denser than any town/city in other Nintendo game, although it is far from the most city-like cities in gaming as a whole. You're spending most of your exploration fighting aliens, sneaking past aliens, running over blue diamonds on the map, taking in beautiful alien biome sights, running to Ubisoft towers of lights, and vibing in a mech through flight or vehicle transformation.\n\nIt's an amazing open world overall when it comes to the raw fundamentals of fun environments and enemies, but don't expect anything like an immersive-sim type game.",

I have also noticed some lighting issues here and there, like some flickering. \n\nThis is a hit and miss remaster. The QOL improvements do make it overall better than the original, especially the UI, but I can't give this a glowing review. It being on the Switch with low specs won't have me blindly defending it.",
