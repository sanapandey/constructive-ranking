    "selftext": "Put my two weeks in at a job where I really loved the people, but the stress level was so intense that I was hospitalized a few months ago. I\u2019m fairly new to the corporate world & I told myself that plenty of people have higher-stake roles & somehow, they\u2019re able to handle it. Why can\u2019t I? Then the truth started pouring in. \n\nOnce my resignation went out, my coworkers started talking. Turns out, the last person in my role was also so stressed to the point that she was hospitalized. She worked there for 5+ years before my boss took over, & then she got pushed over the edge in less than a year- just like me. I also found out that my boss bullied her severely, trying to isolate her from other people in the office. & it\u2019s like I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nAll the things I thought were \u201cnormal\u201d, like my boss seeing me wiping away tears from stress & not caring, ignoring my already-packed calendar when adding another tight deadline, laughing off very obvious HR violations in our meetings with other team members, calling me on weekends & outside of work hours, etc. ISNT THE NORM. Especially for my role. To put this in perspective, I had the same work-volume as my previous job, but we had a team of four instead of one. Despite me hitting 100% of my deadlines on time (or early), I never received a positive review. & you know my ass had to take the fall when we lost. I come from a blue collar family & had no insight to what the corporate world was like, making me the perfect candidate to ride hard & put up wet. & I took it until I couldn\u2019t.\n\nI hate that the previous person in my role went through the same thing, but I feel so validated. I\u2019m not dumb or incapable, I just had a shitty boss who expected me to be a machine. Only bright side is, I was too busy to get a proper meal in over this last year & finally lost the 20 pounds I put on in college :D But seriously, I am excited to be starting with a new company on a TEAM instead of flying solo. Even if I have another shitty boss, at least I\u2019ll have some folks who get me.  ",

Then set the settings on that app and email to be DND from 5pm-9am and NADA on weekends. Don't be available ever for ANY work related ANYTHING outside of work hours. Even if you're salary,  doesn't matter..... salary doesn't mean infinite; and working over 40 devalues your work and disrespects your time. \n\nSecondly don't take on more. Only do what you are capable of doing. If boss gives you more;  email and ask \"I need you to clarify the priority in the competing tasking as your assignments will push - insert thing- back and - insert thing- will need to be reassigned. I\nPlease advise as to your preferential order of completion and which assignments you would like me to send back to be reassigned\"\n\nLastly,  STOP working at a pace that isn't healthy for you. The world won't end and no one will die if you work at a pace that's best for you.....",

If it is equal pay for equal work then no one is superior, right?  What the other person is making has nothing to do with the relationship between your work and the pay you are given for it.  From day one you need to establish this dynamic with your employer and let them know you don\u2019t have a boss. Your work will be much less stressful that way.",
