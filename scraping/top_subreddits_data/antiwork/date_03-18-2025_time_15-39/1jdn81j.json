    "selftext": "What they do, with precision and calculation, is manufacture false narratives and artificial catastrophes, keeping the people in a perpetual state of fear, distraction, and desperation while they plunder the economy like feudal lords stripping a dying kingdom. Recessions, debt crises, inflation panics, stock market \"corrections\"\u2014all engineered, all manipulated, all designed to transfer wealth upward.\n\nMeanwhile, it is the workers who create everything of value\u2014the hands that build, the minds that design, the bodies that toil. Yet, they are told that their suffering is natural, that the economy is an uncontrollable force rather than a rigged casino where the house always wins. Every crisis serves as a new opportunity for the ruling class to consolidate power, to privatize what should be public, to break labour, to demand \"sacrifices\" from the very people who built their fortunes. But the truth remains: the billionaires are not the engine of progress\u2014they are the parasites feeding off it. And until the people see through the illusion, until they reclaim the wealth that is rightfully theirs, they will remain shackled\u2014not by chains, but by the greatest lie ever told: that the rich are necessary for civilization to function.",

He called it \"soft power\" - it's much more effective at keeping people in line than brute force, if people are the willing participants to their own subjugation.\n\nHere's a quote from Aldous Huxley that really drives the point home: \"The perfect dictatorship would have the appearance of a democracy, but would basically be a prison without walls in which the prisoners would not even dream of escaping. It would essentially be a system of slavery where, through consumption and entertainment, the slaves would love their servitudes.\"",
