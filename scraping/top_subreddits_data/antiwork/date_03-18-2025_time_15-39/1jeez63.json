Golf Digest concluded that Obama played 306 rounds of golf over his two terms, which the magazine describes as \"...a fairly remarkable amount of golf while in office\". Trump visited a Trump Organization property on 428 (nearly one in three) of the 1,461 days of his presidency and is estimated to have played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days.",
