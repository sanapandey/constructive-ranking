    "selftext": "I will try to keep this fairly short. (It\u2019s not.) But since today is St. Patrick\u2019s Day, it marks the anniversary of a life-changing moment for me. I live in southern Missouri and as far as work goes there aren\u2019t very many options. You can work in a sawmill or you can be a nurse. The two gas stations have all the employment they need and the turnover is really low. I have always been a mill worker. It is terrible backbreaking labor that will tear your body down and ruin you. I was getting my GED and tried focusing on math. While working, I started adding up how much the company I was working for made an hour. I was getting $8.75 an hour. I was in charge of feeding a pallet machine. I would unstack a pallet of lumber and keep the machine loaded so it would continuously run. Absolutely terrible work. I would often stay late and work on weekends because I needed to make more money. Even 60 hours a week is not very much when it\u2019s $8.75 an hour. It took four people to run the machine. I was one of the higher paid employees so I know the company did not pay more than $35 an hour to run it. They had their own steam generator on site. They burned the scraps from their mill production to keep the generator going. They only cut their own trees so they did not have to buy lumber. They had to buy the land. Which, at the time was ridiculously cheap compared to now. The machine we ran put out 21 pallets in three minutes. They were charging $13 a pallet. So they were making approximately $5460 an hour. When I realize that, I said fuck this and walked off. I became a logger because I learned how much more money loggers can make. I started making really good money. While cutting responsibly mind you. I never clearcut. I went to saw classes and learned the proper way to cut a tree from the Department of conservation so it also had the least amount of impact on the land. But, five years ago on St. Patrick\u2019s Day I was working and I could not keep my tractor running so I kept working on it to try and get it going. Due to a strange angle and greasy, oily hands, my hand slipped while turning a wrench and went in the fan of the motor while it was running. I cut my finger most of the way off except the skin on the bottom and it hit my thumb twice. Cut it halfway off and broke several bones. I do have a picture of the x-ray and the injury as well. Somehow, I kept peace of mind enough to take a picture. I have always worked alone in the woods. I was miles out. I tried jumping on the tractor and driving it to my mom\u2018s house, but it died. I had to hike back to my mom\u2019s and nobody was there. Once I got cell phone service I called 911 and immediately laid down. They had just changed rural addresses in the dispatch system. So my address was not in the system. I laid there for probably 20 to 30 minutes, looking at my bones and wondering if I would survive. I remembered that my mom\u2018s field looks like a pistol and my neighbors field looked like a rabbit. I told the dispatch where the local river was, and she knew immediately where I was so they sent an ambulance. Once we got to town, they had already called in a life flight. It cost me $50,000 to fly 88 miles. The surgery was 22,000. I did not have insurance. I just paid my tractor off in February. I was looking at buying a house. And then I had to move back in with my mom. She had a stroke about six months later. I had to take care of her in her final days while taking care of everything else. When she died, my uncle got the farm and evicted us so he could sell it. I tried buying a house with my $10,000 inheritance that I\u2019d gotten. This was right after Covid when the housing crisis went crazy. It was a murder house and I was going to have to clean it and take care of everything at the same time. But someone outbid me anyways. I had a wood shop that I invested a lot of money in over the years and while everything was shut down, I was turning. I didn\u2019t get stimulus or food stamps or anything and learned to be self-sufficient. I asked myself how hard I would work with this machine if it was at the pallet mill I left years earlier. So I pushed myself to become better and better. I decided to buy a bus and try to build a Skoolie. I don\u2019t really have very much building experience. But that doesn\u2019t matter anyways because insurance companies pretty much stopped insuring school buses for RV use. If I get a CDL I could drive my bus. But that would cost like $5000 and I don\u2019t have that right now. I can make four bowls an hour with my lathe. I\u2019m really fast. I can do decorative work, I can do pot leaves. I can do pens. I can do spoons I can make urns (I actually made my mother\u2019s urn but won\u2019t post a bunch of pictures. You can look at my posts if you wanna see that shit.) I believe in myself enough that I damn sure will not go and work for somebody else. If I get a job right now it will have to be at a sawmill. I cannot really do hours and hours of physically demanding labor because my hand hurts. And I just don\u2019t want to. Fuck that. I will make $15 an hour, that is if the Republican lead lawmakers in my state, don\u2019t revoke the minimum wage law that was just voted in. So if I go work 40 hours a week I will make 600 bucks before taxes. That is 2-3 baskets if I get better at marketing. That would be twelve rolling trays. I can make 12 rolling trays in three hours. So I would rather learn how to manage my business better than go work for someone else. I would rather find 10 head shops to supply, and several art museums to sell my artistic work in. I would rather go sit on the beach and sell bowls. My plan with the bus was to drive around the country and sell my wares. 100 sales in 10 cities. I\u2019ll make double living a life most people do when they retire, while doing something most people consider a hobby. That is why I am against working. Believe it or not I had to leave a lot of stuff out and this is the shorter version. If you made it this far, I appreciate it and I wish you a happy St. Patrick\u2019s Day. Please do not drink and drive.",

I feel like if more people went out and started working for themselves, then the capital owning class would stop thinking that owning equipment is more important than doing the work.\n\nWhile your antiwork story is still on its journey, I wish you the best and hope it gives you more than enough to make a living. I hope it can get you thriving.\n\nI'm working on starting my antiwork story myself. I work in pest control and have worked for a few companies. Most of the companies I worked for in the past were very greedy. 1 company paid $13/hr, and it required 6 days a week with 12 to 13 hours each day. The company I'm currently with pays a bit better and gives me an 8 hour day at the longest, but is usually about 6 hours a day, I'm paid salary, so shorter days don't cost me anything. The company I'm currently working for is helping me get the license I need to start my own pest control company. When I get my Certified Applicators license, I will be able to open my own pest control company. Basically, if I got paid all the money customers pay currently for the work I do for them, I would get $2500/week. If I got paid 100% of the money that was paid for the work I did for the 1st company, I would make $19,500/week. Even at $2500/week, it would be a comfortable living just killing bugs.",

She sells her work (a wide range from clothing to craftwork) on social media and attends local fairs. Even if she has to work on Sundays, she's immensely happy now. She's given up smoking. She ditched the antidepressants. Glad to hear you made ir through the difficulties of your own life and happy St Patrick's Day (with a little delay!).",

On the contrary, self employed people know how properly valuing themselves create a value-rich cycle, and therefore are likely to treat and respect others well.",

People criticized me for leaving the money, great insurance, and career options and all that jazz. My wife and I started publishing our own books.

This feels like the path I\u2019m supposed to be on. When the time came putting in my resignation, I was never more sure of a decision than perhaps the day I proposed to my wife. I knew deep down this was the road I needed to be on, not faking it til I made it. You\u2019ll get there too, in the moment it sucks.\u00a0\n\nBut in the end, maybe it\u2019ll work out.
