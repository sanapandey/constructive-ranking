    "selftext": "Not even a fucking year ago I moved to this city specifically for this job. It was as close to a dream job as I could ask for: it was a small company (less than 10 employees), non-corporate, it shared the same values I did, and all of of my coworkers were just beyond fantastic, I genuinely couldn\u2019t have asked for much better. I literally never once was written up, in fact my employer had nothing to say except to sing my praises when I would ask for feedback! I did damn good work, and I was proud to work there. \n\nWelp, it was all for fucking nothing. \n\nSince the election, and since the inauguration especially, we have been a lot more open in the office about talking our political beliefs, and exactly none of us were happy with Trump being elected, let alone the daily bombardment of downright crazy shit he\u2019s been doing since 1/20. \n\nCome today, the owner asked me to come in a little early. We had a new employee starting in my department so I just assumed it was related to that, and discussing how the power structure or division of work would happen once they start. Could not have been further from the truth. \n\nHe starts with asking me about my weekend and how I\u2019m feeling (I called out sick Friday) and after some small talk he goes \u201clisten ____, I\u2019ve loved having you work here and you\u2019ve been so stellar in the role and frankly I\u2019ve been so impressed with your work since you started here.  But unfortunately since the election, our business has taken a massive hit financially. Tariffs are screwing us, the markets are crashing, and frankly people aren\u2019t buying our goods like they used to. So we need to reshuffle the company structure a bit, so today will be your last day.\u201d\n\n\nI took this job specifically because it was a place I saw myself long term, it was a place I could be content staying at for more than a few years. I went $20k in debt moving halfway across the fucking country and for this job, just for me to lose it because Donald Fucking Trump has to go and play god emperor with our country. And my now ex-boss did say he would help me find a new job however he could, but like I work in a small niche industry, the odds of finding another job in my city is small to none\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m so tired of this fucking country man.

Working with people with an extreme political opinion towards either side and they are vocal about it is a terrible working environment and will make you miserable, and I speak from experience unfortunately.\n\nYou can look up if the company you worked for got PPP loans, if it did and your wage was not paid by it, the company committed fraud and you should report it.\n\nLook towards the CA governor and legislator for the lockdown policies that affected you, the company had no say in the matter, only how the company responded to it, which apparently was an employer whining to his employees; which makes him a terrible leader. But a government rendering an employer powerless and losing over 90% of your income to a government edict at the swipe of a pen, well... I too would be livid.  \n\nNo company has the right to require or abstain vaccination, and if they do, and many made it a requirement during the plandemic, they violated workers their religious rights, and for that many corporations and even government departments have gotten a lawsuit and are now paying hefty amounts for violating workers religious rights.",

If you said, our only goal is to extract as much money from rich people as possible. You could get about 1- to 2% of GDP. That's real money. It doesn't get you off the hook for making difficult decisions elsewhere.\n\n>RIEDL: The middle class is going to have to pay to close most of the gap. That's how Europe does it.

That increase is attributable to the growing share of the population age 65 or older. The program\u2019s revenues would remain near 4.5 percent of GDP during that 75-year period. After 2098, the gap between revenues and outlays as a percentage of GDP would widen, and shortfalls would continue to grow.",

Your whole job (at least in my daughter's dept) is about hitting those numbers. Your speed, your accuracy, your \"pick rate\". And it's so stupid how it's set up.

I still do a little AI training but the pay is crap now.  When I first started doing this I didn't realize what I was doing. The work was like the Google classroom work I did, just simple clickwork and coming up with questions and answers related to different topics so I thought it was like that.\n\nAnyway... not much left in the AI training world since they unleashed it as entertainment bots.

My degree is in mass comms, PR, and journalism, but for over 20 years I\u2019ve worked in IT, in a technical role. I\u2019m active on a couple of reddit tech subs, and the number of times I get called out as being, or using, AI, based on how I write is disheartening. \n\nIT is one field that could do with a bit of up-skilling in terms of the overall communication abilities of the people in it. Instead of embracing and appreciating solid communication skills, it feels to me as if it\u2019s perceived as threatening instead. And, somehow, being a woman is relevant, and pointed at as proof that I can\u2019t *really* be an actual human, writing actual comments. \n\nFurther to that, don\u2019t even get me started on what happens when I point out obviously AI generated content myself, on any sub. It\u2019s readily identifiable if you\u2019re used to analysing language and know the patterns LLMs like ChatGPT exhibit. \n\nI\u2019d like to be able to feel flattered that people confuse my writing for AI generated content, but it\u2019s actually a little bit insulting: to me LLM content lacks any kind of humanity, or emotion, and that\u2019s absolutely not how I want my writing to come across.

I have maybe an hour a day where I can actually collaborate with anyone on my team, and when I do I can\u2019t understand a goddamned word they\u2019re saying.  \n\nThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019m on the hunt again for a new job.  I\u2019ve been leaning into this for a couple years now but the last straw was the c-suite cutting our annual bonus by 80 fucking percent.  It\u2019s just not worth it anymore",

No assumptions needed.  \n \nThe offshore people that are competent to the level of onshore markets are too expensive to offshore to, because they're competent enough to get life changing offers and most often leave their country to live and work in first world countries. They compete with onshore market and thus are not cheap. That's how it has always, always been. \n \nYou always get what you pay for, especially when you're an idiot American exec being manipulated by Indian companies like Infosys into believing you're the first person to discover some hidden secret of cheap engineering as if it's all the same quality everywhere in every country. It's not.",

And they still work there, using the platform I built from scratch, keeping the lights on.\n\nAnd the most bizarre thing to me is all these job openings not being filled and yet companies are actively interviewing and reposting them. They are either looking for unicorns that don't exist, trying to lure people away from competition, or something else entirely with how they're spending so many resources to interview so many folks and not hire any.\n\nI literally had Amazon fly me to Seattle for a job that required relo, a whole day of interviews (some of which were virtual, which was hilarious), and didn't make me an offer. What's worse is that they reposted the job I was interviewing for _moments before my whole day of interviews was set to begin!_ What kind of message does that send to candidates?\n\nAnd they have a policy of no feedback to candidates, which again is a CYA move for cowards. \n\nA noticeable uptick in job postings, but no slowing in the new \"Open For Work\" postings... Feels like a lot of hedging bets tbh",

Worked there for close to 5\u00bd.  The boss got mad when I told him I was leaving, said that they \"took care of me\" and \"invested\" a lot in training me and giving me experience.  I said I'd work another month.  Boss man came on the job site I was working on about 3 days later and told me that I should just leave at the end of that day.  It sucked because I wanted to work with everyone (we always rotated helpers, and we'd often have other crews come assist one anther) one last time before going.\n\nThe 1st guy to leave voluntarily was another cousin or 2nd cousin.  He realized how badly he was getting screwed, but I didn't know him too much since he was only around a couple months while I was still new.  He's doing well according to Linked-In, and I've come across his business cards at my current place of employment oddly enough.  It was a lot of drama and no one could fathom someone leaving.

Of course it wasn't exactly Dollar General wages, but you were never going to get ahead with what they paid, and the worst was that there was just no time off to enjoy life, which was the major grievance for me.\n\nThen one day I realized that I had spent the past year just cutting into drywall and breathing in nasty drywall and insulation dust on these old and nasty remodels.  And all I wanted was some nice brand new construction and the smell of pine and working in at least reasonably clean conditions.  I was Milton in the basement, and I just wanted to be able to hold the Red Stapler from time to time.  Just every so often, you know?  There were some other revelations here and there, like wondering why we couldn't work 4-10's or be a little more flexible on the start/end times.",

It was employing 30 Ukrainians in their country.  I know that one has not been reinstated\n\nLast year we closed on a grant that we won where we helped Ukraine optimize their border crossing policies/software/process.  My understanding is it lead to something like 20% increase in efficiency regarding border crossings from Ukraine into Poland.  \n\nWe also had quite a few Iranian-Americans working with us.  Their programs worked with Iranians in-country to teach them how to be activists in their country or how to organize community events and programs to help themselves.  Some of the work also revolved around making things more accessible for those with disabilities. \n Unfortunately, that also included empowering women or those with disabilities which is a no-no with the current administration",

Even neurotypical people can have a very hard time telling if they\u2019ve bothered people by the way they act, and it\u2019s going to be even harder for someone on the spectrum.

No small watch company is letting people go over a stock market correction of 10%. And luxury spending is NOT down.  Your boss just replaced you with a cheaper out of country hire.",

No. It was simply being sold as there's more work there at HQ than in our satellite office.

Tariffs are screwing us, the markets are crashing, and frankly people aren\u2019t buying our goods like they used to. So we need to reshuffle the company structure a bit\n\nThe election was four months ago. President Trump was sworn in on January 20, 2024, two months ago. Tariffs were ***announced*** on February 1 (25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on imports from China). On February 3, the President announced a one-month pause on the tariffs for Mexico and Canada. On March 4, ***13 days ago***, the tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China officially went into effect.\n\nThe markets are not crashing. In November 2024, after the results of the election, major indices surged. In December 2024, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 45,000 for the first time. In February 2025, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, declining over 10% from its February peaks, marking the quickest fall since the onset of the COVID-19 market crash. As of this week, the markets have shown signs of recovery: S&P 500 increased by 0.6%\u200b, Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.9%\u200b, Nasdaq Composite advanced by 0.3%\u200b.\n\nThe bottom line is that the owner hired your replacement at a lower cost and fired you, providing bullshit reasons.\n\nI am truly curious how the business has \"taken a massive hit financially\" since the election when the President has only been in office for two months and tariffs have only been in place for 13 days.",

These larger companies also prefer that there be documentation for firings, like negative performance reviews and performance development plans that list all your weaknesses and mistakes, and give you a time period to fix them. But ultimately that's just meant for documentation or to get your preplacement approved, and they've already decided to fire you. \n\nLegally they can fire you immediately for any reason, as long as it's not tied to demographic discrimination; although that itself is very difficult to prove after that fact.",

It is likely that the owners are Trump voters if not vocal supporters who would be cheering on the tariffs.  I don't buy for a minute that a staff of 10 highly skilled tradesman who work in the luxury consumer space \"would not be happy with Trump being elected\".  50/50 at best. My best guess is that 7-8 of your co-workers (fake) are Trump voters. \n1. The best steel, titanium, and aluminum is produced domestically.  If they have been importing metals before, they might be buying domestic now.\n1. The amount of material in each watch is a very small fraction of the manufacturing cost.  \n1. Extremely dubious that material inventory is so low that they are purchasing tariffed metals already.  \n1. The customers for American watches are not price sensitive. It is a luxury item purchased by well informed and well monied individuals\n1. It is entirely to early to know if luxury made American watches will have a sales slump because of tariffs. \n1. American made watches are the perfect item for the MAGA crowd to embrace; American made from American produced materials. I am not sure there is a more perfect luxury MAGA consumer product.",

You're acting like you're owed a job or something.\n\nConsider this a huge lesson at some expense, but one you will hopefully never forget. Next time at least ask chatgpt before making life changing decisions to explain the risks of such actions.",

It sucks, but watch out for yourself, often nobody else will.",

There is always someone that will hate you for your politics, and they will stab you in the back over it. Because...\n\n2) You don't have any friends at work. None. Doesn't matter if you hang out after work or if you know all their kids' names. They are not your friend, and they will turn on you in a heart beat to save their job.  \n\n3) Owners and managers do not give a fuck about you personally. They care about two things: You showing up on time, and you completing your tasks on time. That's it. It doesn't matter how buddy buddy you are with them, if your political views align with theirs, or whatever else. And if you're running your mouth about how shitty politics are right now, that's taking time away from you doing your job. \n\nYou didn't lose your job because of Trump. There are things you either didn't tell us about or didn't know about. Why do I know this? Because they had someone ready to step in on day one to replace you. They actually probably messed up the timing because you probably weren't supposed to see the new hire. That whole speech from the owner was deflecting the blame of letting you go onto Trump instead of whatever actual reason they let you go.  \n\nNow, I hate Trump and Republicans as much as anyone in this sub. I'm sorry you lost your job. It sucks, especially with how the job market is right now and the political climate. Good luck to you.",

Trump just signed orders for tariffs; not every countrt is being imposed...just seems like a red herring ans an excuse that it would be costing the company so much money so quickly. I call bullshit on that. \n\nThe same thing happened to me OP; 4 yrs ago by the shenanigans that the Democrats in congress and the elites had their hands in with COVID. Try landing your foot in the door in the area of your profession that you dreamed of; and its something that very few make it to and most all got there because of someone they know gave them a handout. Not me. I worked my fucking ass off for 20 yrs and i got it because i am goddamn fucking amazing at what i do and i have a good attitude and humble, willing to work , no ego. I didnt have any fucking connections whatsoever; it was all on my own merit. All me. And not 2 yrs later we go into quarantine. The company had a massive lay off right around that time and they even let the remaining higher paid employees vote on a few more lay offs , or take a temporary pay cut so however many more they needed to cut could keep their jobs. \n\nThey were good ppl and took the cut.  And they were already working 6x more than what anyone else anywhere else in their job does; and only getting the pay for one, not 6 \u00d7 more money or even 2 \u00d7.  We were media so we worked througy quarantine and my staff was cut while i stayed on since i was in charge of my 3 depts; although my full time hrs got cut to 10 -15 per week. \n\nFinally we returned to work full time a year later and we had less than 3 months when the exec producer of the whole company scheduled a red eye to our studio and held a mandatory staff meeting for everyone on production for the next morning 3 hrs before our shift usually starts and literally dropped the worlds biggest nuke right on my entire life and future; and all within a few short sentences said in spanish which im not fluent in.  Laid off. Pulling production out of the state. Cause fucking COVID. Because; you know, fuck me for being irresponsible in my career choice and not planning for a goddamn global pandemic that no one ever saw coming. \n\nFunny how the state governor was real fucking quick to order ppl back to work from lock in but fucking Hot Wheels sure as shit didnt do a damn thing to make ppl keep their employees. \n\nI too adored my job and was in excellent standing. \n\nI spent the next 4 yrs penniless, hopeless,  at times even homeless, hungry,  frustrated that i couldnt get work and fuck my lifelong profession--i was over here trying to get a job at winco and target and panera bread--anything for a paycheck and nothing. \nI was also suicidally depressed and vibrating with anger. \n\nSo yeah i get it. It fucking sucks. However--with all due respect--this is more on you than trump. \n\nFirst mistake is paying out of your own pocket several thousand dollars to move when you should have negotiated with the company because they should foot the bill for your moving fees because they knew you were relocating and would have to move. \n\nIf they refused you shouldnt have accepted the offer  . \n\nSecond mistake--which even further proves my point--is your decision to go all in on such a small company. Ten total ppl? Did i read that right? Yeah; you should know or someone like your parents or family,  should have warned you this is a bad idea even if its down the street from where you live if job security matters to you. It seems like a good idea maybe ; more chances of advancement if they can stay afloat and grow.  However in my experience they usually dont and while u might be able to keep it for a while; small businesses take advantage of you a lot, and they dont usually offer any benefits like insurance.  This was not a wise move or investment on your part, esp seeing as how you knew youd have to move and lose money . \n\n\nTrump had to push tariffs. Im sorry but he did. He promised to put America first.  Hes keeping that promise. He cant put America first and continue to let every other country we trade with charge us 3\u00d7, 5\u00d7, and 7\u00d7 the amount their resource is worth or what theyre charging every other country for the same damn thing.  Even if it fucks me too eventually; u and i are only 2 ppl and he has to operate for the greater good over protecting everyones employment. \n\nAlso not a bad idea to just keep quiet about political beliefs,  religion, etc when you're at work for the next job. Even if everyone else is and agrees and is on the same side as far as you know. You never really know and its one of those things; esp this election, what someone truly feels and we are living in a world where taking offense to every damn thing and pettiness with political beliefs can absolutely outweigh your job performance. Its not fair,  or right,  but it is how life goes. \n\nHang in there. We gotta push through the storm to get the rainbow",

            "body": "Here's something I've said elsewhere, but it applies here as well, since it focuses on the attitude one must have when laboring in a late-stage American Capitalist hellscape. \n\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\nThe owners and their ~~bootlicking sycophants~~ *corporate turdwookies* do not care about you. At all. \n\nNeither does your government or courts, as they've been bought & paid for by said owners.\n\nThey also own (anti)social networks & (m)ass media, using them as their personal propaganda mouthpiece.\n\nYour job search is never over. In AWA: At-Will America (99.7% of the population), you can be terminated at any time, for almost any (or no) reason, without notice, without compensation, and full loss of healthcare. \n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n# Your goal is to be the CEO of your life.\n\nYour only obligation is to yourself and your loved ones, like a CEO.\n\nYour mission is to extract as much value from these soulless megacorps as you can, like a CEO.\n\n*Milk the fuckers until sand squirts out of their chafed nips.....like a CEO.*\n\n\n\n# Professional Integrity of a CEO\n\n- Do not worry about results -- \"good enough\" is truly good enough. \n\n- Treat your jobs as cattle, not as pets.\n\n- Work your wage. Going above and beyond is only rewarded with more work. Your name isn't above the door. You don't own the company. So stop caring as if you did own the place. \n\n- Don't work for free or do additional tasks outside of your role, as that devalues the concept of labor. \n\n- Maximize revenue at all times - pump n' dump is a valid Wall Street strategy, so why shouldn't it be your strategy too? You're the sole shareholder of your life. \n\n- Protect your time away from work. When you clock out, you turn off your phone & email until the start of your next shift. Never work when on vacation or during a sick day. \n\n- Remember, there will always be work left undone. If there wasn't, then you're overstaffed and will soon be laid off. So always leave work undone. \n\n\n\n# Self-Care of a CEO\n\n- Sleep well, never skip lunch, get enough physical activity. \n\n- Avoid drinking coffee at work for your employer's benefit, as they don't deserve your caffeinated, productivity-drugged self. \n\n- Avoid alcohol and other vices, as they steal all the happiness from tomorrow for a brief amount today. Especially when used as coping mechanisms for work-related stress. \n\n- Take sick days as needed or desired. If you died on the job, your position will be filled before your body is cold. \n\n\n\n# Executive Authority of a CEO\n\n- **Knowledge is power.** Discussing your compensation with your fellow worker is a federally protected right (for now). Employers hate transparency, as it means they can't pull their bullshit on others without consequence. \n\n- Your first job is being an actor. Endeavor to be pleasant & kind....yet unremarkable, bland, forgettable, and mediocre. Though it may feed one's ego, being a superhero or rockstar isn't suited for this hellscape. Projecting strength invites challenge. Instead, cultivate a personality that flies under the radar. \n\n- Tell no one (friends, coworkers, extended family, etc) about your employment mindset. So many people tie their identity to their employment. And jealously makes people do petty things. Never give your enemy the means to destroy you. \n\n- Recognize that lifestyle is ephemeral. Live below your means. Financial security is comfort, and not being dependent on selling your labor is true power in Capitalism. \n\n\n\n# Be a Chaos Vulture\n\n-  Embrace the confusion. Does the company have non-existent onboarding? Poor management? Little direction, followup, or reviews? Constantly changing & capricious goals? These are the hallmarks of a bad company\u2026so revel in their misery. Actively seek these places out. Never correct your enemy while they're making a mistake.\n\n- Stretch the circus out as long as possible. This gives you room to coast, to avoid being on anyone's radar, etc. Restrained mediocre effort will be considered \"going above and beyond.\" Even if you slip, you can easily blame \"the system\", like everyone else at the place. Every single day, week, month of this is more money in your pocket.\n\n- 1944 official CIA guide for citizen sabotage of organizations: https://i.redd.it/7r0grz6dgsn81.png\n\n- Do not worry about \"the environment you leave behind\" when you depart a company. Do you think they're going to care about your personal well-being ~~if~~ when they lay you off? \n\n- Notice is a merely a courtesy, not a legal requirement (save for a few exceptions). Continuity of THEIR business operations is THEIR problem, not yours. They should have a plan if you accidentally got hit by a bus full of winning lottery tickets. Would they give you notice before laying you off?\n\n- Always be kind to your peers, but don't worry about them when you leave.

Lie, manipulate, and deceive. \n\nLet them think you're giving 110% all the time. You are passionate of their \"initiatives du jour\". You exist solely for them. Their shit don't stink. *\u2026you get the picture.*\n\nAnd if ever called out otherwise, deny deny deny. Gaslight them, use plausible deniability, etc. But you never confirm any of the above, even if they got you dead-to-rights and are walking you out the door. \n\nRemember: *They'd do exactly the same to you.*\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# They sleep perfectly fine at night.
