When they refuse, state you will stop the meeting due to their refusal but will not turn off the recording until you have exited and leave the meeting. Don't stop it until you are out of the room or bakc at your desk, so they don't try to force you into the meeting after you shut it off. \n\nYou need to announce the recording and give them the opportunity to tell you they do not consent, but you do have the right to say you refuse to continue without the recording and that if they continue to discuss then you will take that as permission to record. If they follow you out, do the same thing - I will continue recording as long as this discussion is ongoing. If you continue to discuss, then you are agreeing to my recording. That's how it works when you call into a recorded line. They don't stop recording because you refuse. The conversation ends.",

The only thing I could think of that would cause them to say \u201cyou can\u2019t record\u201d without it being sketchy or against labor laws would be if something like HIPPA would prevent them from doing so because it could release confidential information about people, but things like that are quite limited and if it\u2019s regarding PTO this should be something OP can record and bring to a lawyer to see if they think it\u2019s legal.

If you think there isn\u2019t, and want to advocate for yourself, here\u2019s some advice.\n\nRecording in WA state is tricky, but it\u2019s not that important. If the result of this meeting is something other than them complying with the law, there will likely be evidence and a recording won\u2019t be totally necessary.\n\nAsk to bring a \u201cnote-taker\u201d so that you can focus on the conversation, and bring another employee you trust. Have that person listen and take notes during the meeting. After, write a narrative of what happened and note the date the meeting happened and the date when you wrote your narrative. \u00a0If they don\u2019t want another party, you can take your own notes. If they don\u2019t let you or try to take them from you, don\u2019t fight it and just note that afterward when you write up your narrative.\n\nYou don\u2019t need your bosses to acknowledge your narrative is true or anything for it to be solid evidence in the future. You can write in an email \u201cthese were my takeaways from the meeting, can you confirm?\u201d But unless your bosses are monumentally stupid, they will understand what\u2019s happening and spin the response or not respond if they did something shady.\u00a0\n\nHaving a witness who can back up your account does a lot. Just having the account, even without a witness, is great evidence and a court will take it seriously.\u00a0\n\nAdvocating for yourself gets tricky as it can be hard to focus on finding a resolution that is just and acceptable to both parties when you are angry. There\u2019s no shame in swallowing your pride if it helps you get what you want. That doesn\u2019t mean you should be a doormat, but you want to stay focused on facts and practical solutions rather than blame and emotional grievance. Focus on this event, not anything tangential to it unless they have further questions. Your manager might be the biggest asshole to ever live, but that\u2019s probably not relevant to what your bosses choose to do about this. It\u2019s certainly possible that someone wants to fire your manager and they need grounds to do that without paying unemployment. In the big scheme of things, making you whole is probably cheap, and a reasonable boss will be willing to do so.\n\nIf during the meeting they ask you what you want to make it right, some things that might help:\n\n-A new manager to do your scheduling/supervise you\n-Backpay for any missed hours you should have had\n-A return to your previous normal hourly load and a promise to continue that in the future\n\nStuff that probably won\u2019t happen/won\u2019t help:\n-money for damages/suffering/feelings\n-some sort of apology (people often want this, but it\u2019s meaningless)\n-mandatory training on the law for your manager or others (again, this usually comes across as a power move and makes things confrontational).\n\nShowing that you are reasonable and just want to be made whole and protected from future problems will be a huge benefit if something comes up again in the future and you need to go over your manager\u2019s head.\u00a0\n\nAll that being said, if an attorney believes you can get real money, wants to work on contingency, and you think it\u2019s worth it to pursue, absolutely do so.",
