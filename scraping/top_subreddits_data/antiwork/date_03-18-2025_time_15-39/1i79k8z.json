The following social media sites may no longer be linked or have screenshots shared:\n\n* X, including content from its predecessor Twitter, because Elon Musk promotes white supremacist ideology and gave a Nazi salute during Donald Trump's inauguration\n* Any platform owned by Meta, such as Facebook and Instagram, because Mark Zuckerberg openly encourages bigotry with Meta's new content policy\n* Platforms affiliated with the CCP, such as TikTok and Rednote, because China is a hostile foreign government and these platforms constitute information warfare\n\nThis policy will ensure that r/antiwork does not host content from far-right sources.  We will make sure to update this list if any other social media platforms or their owners openly embrace fascist ideology.  We apologize for any inconvenience.",

He is legitimately one of the most hated people among certain schools of though on economics and business. He's just a total scum bag and he runs Google like it's a criminal enterprise.\n\nIt is actually incredibly sad to see a company that seemed to have such a bright future get completely steered into a cycle of self destruction and revenue optimization in place of innovation. The opportunity lost there is just unbelievably immense. It really is a total failure of leadership, but hey, the numbers look good, so the shareholders don't care. So, nothing matters.\n\nThey're doing a great job letting Apple lead them and being competitors I guess. What's the point of spending money to create new products when you can just copy cat somebody else's ideas?",

Typically the service you are providing to your customers is built on top of other services which are specific to AWS/GCP/whatever, and not just running on a leased virtual machine. (Which is also a service, but one that is going to be the same on every provider) Moving to a different provider would mean refactoring your product to use a new set of services. On top of that, the providers usually have some kind of commercial sting which keeps you locked in. Like they charge you a really expensive fee to extract your data in bulk, so that it can be moved to another provider. \n\nIf you know that all three of the main providers are in cahoots, then you are going to be less likely to be willing to pay in the development and financial cost of moving, knowing that the provider you are moving to is likely to treat you just as bad as the one you are leaving. \n\nIn another comment someone made the valid point that there are other providers beside AWS, Azure and GCP, but still I think that is a crazy amount of power concentrated in a small group of people. People who got front row seats at the presidential inauguration  while the actual elected officials were forced to sit in the overflow room.",

The audience needs to exist first for something to stick around. Bluesky is just a decent twitter style app with self-moderated content and some other decent user focused features. I think Mastodon put too much emphasis on the underlying technology. Apple and Steve Jobs taught the world users don't care about the underlying technology, they care about the user experience.\n\nI understand the irony after I advocated for it from a tech perspective, but I'm a nerd and I care about those things and also this is Reddit. Just switching to what I think Bluesky has to offer over Mastodon? Or AT vs Activity Pub? Marketing. It's easier to convince my friends to use Bluesky. So everyone will be there.",

Things grow too fast these days for infrastructure to handle. The reason you have hominid feces flinging like behavior is because the technical knowledge barrier to entry is low. It's so low we have videos of other species using iPads and other modern human technology.\n\n\n\n\nIt shouldn't be so easy that a fucking bird can fly down, swoop up an iPhone, and start scrolling bird porn immediately.",

I think this is where Bluesky has an edge over something like Mastodon. Bluesky hasn't really made the tooling the focus of the platform, they've kept it pointed at the user experience. I'm just interested in the tooling because I like programming and networking.\n\nWhen people use social media it's usually because they ask \"is everyone else on there?\" And does it have a good algorithm and moderation. Basically all user experience questions. Bluesky has those things. \n\nI'm not really sure it's fair to compare email and social media by asking \"if people don't enjoy email, why would they enjoy a social media platform?\" Well cause one is a tool for a specific type of communication and one is a form of entertainment and connecting with people. I thought that was self explanatory.",

The Chinese government is not afraid to Luigi some rich folk who try to throw their weight around or get in the way of a larger piece of policy.\n\nWe can argue all day whether China is socialist or capitalist or whatever, but they are whooping the west's ASS when it comes to economic planning. And that was *before* we handed them the entire green energy industry on a silver fuckin' platter.\n\nThe worst part is we have all the tools to do it ourselves, and we DO plan our economy, only it's planned by billionaires for the sole purpose of becoming trillionaires.\n\nLike, you know those \"empty cities\" people love to post, how all these buildings were built and nobody lives there?\n\nYeah, people live there now. Because China was building infrastructure from the ground-up for the purpose of industry and habitation, and not just letting everything sprawl out wildly based on what results in the best quarterly earnings report. They designed cities *years in advance* to be livable and efficient. \n\nAnd I'm not saying there aren't any problems to fix, and there's no corruption. But the fuckin' Walton family isn't in charge of the central planning.\n\nYou wanna' talk about efficiency. Capitalist, socialist, communist, whatever you wanna' call them, they're a hell of a lot more efficient than *us.* Not to mention people here don't seem to understand why mainlanders are so loyal--they've seen in the span of a single generation a society transformed from impoverished agrarian peasantry to a global superpower, and that wealth was *spread around.* EVERYONE'S quality of life improved in China on a purely economic level. You gotta' blindfold yourself to dismiss that so casually.\n\nThe idea of China being a \"hostile foreign power\" here in a sub that claims to be revolutionary is a fuckin' joke. I ain't saying China's the global heroes saving the world, but to pretend they're worse than any particular Western nation is ludicrous--blind not to China's corruption, but our own. Or worse, fuckin' proud of our own corruption.\n\nAnd on a political level, China's government is a lot more malleable by the public than the US government. There's a saying in Chinese political circles that's basically \"In America, you can change the party but not the policy. In China, you can change the policy but not the party.\" Meaning, the DNC and GOP agree on a lot of fundamental shit like immigration, Gaza, the capitalist economy, and both of them are largely designed to preserve the same status quo. In China, it's officially uniparty, but the party is a lot more reactive to public pressure, such as rescinding COVID lockdowns even when they really *shouldn't have* because the public was on the verge of mass riots. The Overton Window in China is a lot different than the US, but the public can exhibit enough pressure to change immediate policy, while the US parties have an attitude of almost anti-populism, where the parties deliberately refuse to do certain things purely because they're popular. Unpopular members of the party in China are dealt with harshly, and politicians who embarrass the party don't just get to hang out for 50 years being a problem.",

Many so called Uyghur advocacy groups, like the World Uyghur Congress, are funded by the US government and Western intelligence agencies. If you have firsthand accounts from Uyghurs actually living in Xinjiang, let's hear them but they shouldn't be filtered through imperialist institutions.\n\nIf you want to say that from 2017 to 2019 they were putting people into reeducation camps in Xinjiang before they actually committed a crime I'll agree with you that's fucked up and shouldn't happen, that is a human rights violation.\n\nBut the last vocational training centers were largely phased out by 2019/2020. Even at their height, they were never concentration camps, there was no systematic mass killing, forced sterilization, or destruction of an ethnic group, all of which are necessary for the term genocide to apply. \n\nYou're actually insane If you think there is a genocide happening in Xinjiang. Cultural assimilation sure, but that's a different conversation, one that applies globally and isn't a human rights violation. So let's not pretend that cultural commodification is the same as ethnic cleansing. If you want to see a real genocide happening right now, look at Gaza, not Xinjiang.",

In Nanjiecun, probably the 1k USD per month place you're talking about, citizens get a free apartment and furniture upon becoming of age, employment is guaranteed, you get a weekly dole of food (staples like rice, oil and flour), utilities and healthcare are free, daycare, K-12 education are free as well as your choice of vocational school or university if you opt for higher education. You only earn 1k usd a month but that's just leisure money. \n\nContrast that with Shanghai, which has a stock exchange. If it's a top down monolith every location would have the same policies. \n\nI'm literally in China right now, and have been for months. I've seen employees squatting on sidewalks to quickly devour a cup of instant noodles before they have to go back to work, I have seen employees get a 2 hour proper lunch break. I've seen construction sites with high vis vests and hardhats and a different construction site the next province over with bamboo scaffolding being climbed by a team of guys with cigarettes in their mouths and a pair of \u00a515 yuan sunglasses as protection while welding something. \n\nI have to explain this to Australians when I go back next month, but China isn't some utopia that tankies insist it is, but that delusion might be slightly closer to the truth than western media and Falun Gong propaganda.",

Unlike this hell site, RedNote has rules about engagement to create a pleasant and thus a good experience on their platform. People are kind and welcoming.  Even when there is disagreement, it\u2019s civil.  There are videos where scuba divers are just placing their cameras underwater so we can see and hear all the beautiful fish swimming.  The captions say things like \u201cI know it\u2019s a crazy world out there and you might need this.\u201d At the end they talk about how the environment deserves honor, care and good treatment & I do too. Literally just oceans to soothe viewers.  Tons of cooking videos!  I love these cooking videos as part of the CPC propaganda!  I can\u2019t wait to get back home to make orange chicken and beef with broccoli.  Also some funky potato dish that I don\u2019t even know what it is.  The queer content is SO good!  People being authentic relaxed versions of queerness instead of some sort of caricature about it.\n\n\nIf this is curated propaganda for left-leaning Americans, then goddamnit make some of that shit over here. Give us a platform that is better than the one we\u2019ve found. Provide a left leaning platform where people have a higher standard of engagement and better content than this or STFU.",

Reddit is great for now, Idk if it'll get sold on who knows. But rednote can be just one of the many mixed apps people should perhaps look at, if only for better understanding cross culturally.\n\nI don't want to be misunderstood in this way \ud83d\ude4f",

But, for an example, I believe banks and financial systems should be nationalized. I also think there should be a progressive corporate tax on compensation disparities. And, similar to a minimum wage, there should be a minimum compensation that is directly tied to company revenue and employee count. I think all healthcare should be public, including all pharmaceutical development, and in that sense \"Medicare For All\" is a miniscule part of that picture.    \n    \nBut, again, I want to clarify that I like Sanders a great deal, and I think he'd be more progressive if the system he's in allowed for it.",

Most companies in democratic countries are not completely beholden to their govt in NEARLY the same way that is the case for TikTok. If you live in a western democracy, you should be worried about companies like TikTok for that reason, not because it's Chinese neccesarily.\n\nI also encourage you to think about whether you want an autocratic govt to have the potential to directly use a platform to negatively affect the thoughts of citizens of the most powerful country in the world.

China has also not shown any meaningful movement in transitioning away from a state capitalist form of government into a socialist form of government.   If you want an actually good example of a socialist country then maybe look at Cuba instead, of course taking into consideration extremely unfair economic sanctions and trade restrictions by capitalist countries (especially the US) are making it extremely difficult for them to develop.\n\nCalling China communist is falling for US propaganda 101.",

They have made zero movement towards transitioning into a method of governance where workers own the means of productions.  Hell, they don't even have worker co-ops, and those can and do exist within a capitalist society; instead, all these massive state-operated or state-guided corporations have a structure where executives make an exponential amount more profit than the employees that actually do the work or make the product.

The mods are banning \"**Platforms affiliated with the CCP**, such as TikTok and Rednote, because China is a **hostile foreign government** and these platforms constitute **information warfare**\"\n\nThey aren't being banned because they are dominating American smartphones, and I don't see why that would matter? Except for the Meta platforms [Both YouTube and Google are more popular in the US than TikTok.](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/)\n\nIf we want to argue on the basis of Genocide, then there are active genocides going on in Israel, Sudan, Ethiopia and Nicaragua as well. But this is not an argument the mods are using.\n\nBecause of how governments interact with large companies in their country, you could claim that any company headquartered in China is affiliated with the CCP. Just like you could claim any American company is affiliated with its government. And to most people in the world the US would fit the definition of \"hostile foreign government\" more than China, in fact if you remove the foreign part I would guess a lot of Americans would agree as well. \n\nI think it's also important to note that Reddit is partly owned by Tencent, who surely would count as CCP affiliated. Would this also mean we can't post anything related to League of Legends as well, since they are also owned by Tencent?\n\nAnd when it comes to information warfare, surely Russia is objectively a lot more hostile than China? We already know for certain Russia played a large part in the first election Donald Trump was elected, and contributed greatly to Brexit, among other local EU elections. Russia doesn't do this through Yandex, but through RT and filtering their propaganda through American YouTubers like Tim Pool, or by propping up people like Nigel Farage.\n\nYou can argue that the Chinese government is bad, and I wouldn't disagree, but that doesn't mean that I think all of their platforms should be banned from this subreddit. Because of the \"great firewall\" Chinese people have very limited access to the internet outside of Chinese platforms. This effectively just means that we are potentially silencing Chinese voices, of people who are going through the same issues everyone else on here does, just in a different country.",

As a result of this, the company is extremely popular with both workers and consumers, and has been extremely successful because of this popularity.

It\u2019s easier to get re-assigned from city to city or rural area to rural area, although still with some hassles, but it\u2019s particularly hard for people to move from rural to urban or vice versa. \n\nFor example, the Chinese govt owns all land everybody just gets 70 year leases, but they up the price by crazy amounts for urban people trying to rent rural land and vice versa. Basically they are trying to avoid the situation we have in the US where a lot of people are spread out into suburban and rural areas where they\u2019re less productive economically and where it costs the government a lot more to build infrastructure and provide services (e.g., every neighborhood street that doesn\u2019t connect to a main road is really just a long government funded driveway, cost of providing that much power/sewer/schools to so many people in areas far away from one another, etc). So in China they regulate where people can live to keep most people in urban areas with just enough people in rural areas to maintain agriculturally productive communities. \n\nIf you\u2019ve heard of \u201cthe left behind children of China\u201d - kids being raised by family members in the countryside while their parents work in the cities - then you may be a little familiar with the results of this system. Those kids have to stay behind because they\u2019re assigned to the countryside and that\u2019s the only place they can access free schooling.",

Media reports in the West have sometimes exaggerated or inaccurately described this concept.[7][8][9] In 2019, the central government voiced dissatisfaction with pilot cities experimenting with social credit scores. It issued guidelines clarifying that citizens could not be punished for having low scores, and that punishments should only be limited to legally defined crimes and civil infractions. As a result, pilot cities either discontinued their point-based systems or restricted them to voluntary participation with no major consequences for having low scores.[7][10] According to a February 2022 report by the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), a social credit \"score\" is a myth as there is \"no score that dictates citizen's place in society\".[7]\n\n>The Social Credit System is an extension to the existing legal and financial credit rating system in China.[11] Managed by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Supreme People's Court (SPC),[12] the system was intended to standardize the credit rating function and perform financial and social assessment for businesses, government institutions, individuals and non-government organizations.[13][14][10] \n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System",

And the recent real estate issues were AWESOME! A real estate corp built a bunch of apartments after taking people's money for them, but then claimed they couldn't give those people all their apartments (because they company fucked around with foreign American investments and lost their shirt in US markets). So the Chinese government stepped in, arrested their owners, fined them BILLIONS of dollars, both the company and the owners, which essentially killed the company, took all those apartments and gave them straight up to the folks who had paid for them. THEN the government, using the money confiscated and a bunch of their own, because China runs on surpluses, paid their own construction company to build apartments for the folks who hadn't had theirs built by the company yet, and be built to their agreed upon contracts, and after two years, nearly every citizen has been made whole.

China has the world's largest democratically elected uni-cameral Congress (meaning no Joe Manchin's to hold things up when it passes in the House, but not the Senate).\n2. Their entire governance structure is bottom up. They translate it as The Mass Line. It means that all their 5 and 20 year plans and all their initiatives come from the people themselves and must be nationally popular. \n3. This is not the place to get into it, but stories about their authoritarian actions are mostly BS or wildly overblown. Winnie the Pooh isn't banned (search him on Red Note, he's super popular), Xi is popular with the people as is their government because he and the government have been working hard to improve their lives. And if you're worried about dissident groups I suggest you check out the BS that is Adrian Zenz (racist German neo-nazi who works for the US government and can't speak a lick of any Chinese language), and the Dahlai Lama's own admittance that the Free Tibet Movement was a CIA Op, and only stopped because it wasn't profitable for the US anymore. \n4. You really think a country of over a billion people who have had a violent military revolution within the last two generations, when most of those revolutionaries are still alive (old but alive), is really going to take shit from their government they put into power if the government wasn't doing what they wanted?! Like come'on! And yes, the Chinese privately own more firearms than the US, they're not disarmed (yet somehow mass shootings aren't an issue over there, huh).\n5. The Great Firewall was to protect their own electronic eco-system from oligarchs like Musk and Zuckerberg coming in and colonizing them. Which it did! It's great over there, and most Chinese who care get a VPN to access Western Internet media, because it's not illegal for them to go out, just illegal for Western media to go into China without promising things like no inherent CIA backdoors built into their Facebook code (hint, those are there in all of Western Internet media, even here).\n6. Back to their government, since just Westerners don't have any idea of how it functions. In China, their Congress is their main form of government. It's called that but it's more like a parliamentary system. Translation, wee! Every single member, including Xi, is elected at their local level, just like House of Rep members are in the US. Once you're in, they have elections for what's called the Working Group. These people have to be elected by the entire Congress. This group works all year, no breaks or recesses. Their job is to implement the current Five Year Plan and help the government officials do that successfully. Then from within the Working Group you have the Central Committee. Think of this group like the President's Cabinet. They are basically the heads of every segment of the government, and the President is elected from that group, and his only real power outside of the working group, unlike the US president, is to act as the face of the government, make speeches, and write about the current plans. His power is more akin to a Mayor on a City Council than the US President (not saying that leading China isn't powerful, he just doesn't have the discretion to make a bunch of Executive Orders about things).\n7. Political parties. There are more political parties in China that have real political power than there are in the US. The US has two capitalist political parties. They are the only ones in power. Every non capitalist party in the US holds zero political power. In China, the CPC (Communist Party of China), not the CCP (US propaganda to make them sound more Soviet aka the CCCP), is like an umbrella party that oversees the political parties in China. I could go into a full hour lecture on their history, but the short answer is that for a hundred years China was colonized by the West. They call it the Century of Humiliation (look up the Delano's and the Opium Wars for fun, yes FDR's grandparents). So they don't trust capitalists over there because capitalists are who destroyed much of China. So back to the CPC, their job is to make sure that any party that is running for office adheres to Marxist-Leninist economic politics and are not capitalists. That's it. Within that range there are a ton of political parties. I believe there are about 12 who hold office in China, and about 7-8 (I haven't checked recently) that are considered major political parties with large contingencies within their Congress. Do you consider the Democrats and the Republicans the same even though both are fully owned and run by the capitalist oligarchs who run the US? I don't, even though I do think they're a lot closer (both are pro imperialism and genocide and anything they benefits the oligarchy here) than most of you do, but I wouldn't call them the same at all.\n\nI could go on for pages, and even this will likely get me banned from here for not being within the guidelines of the  Federales mandated counter-culture (look up anarchy and COINTELPRO). But maybe this will wake enough of you up to start checking out non US sources over even spending a few days on RedNote to see what an unfiltered China is actually like (hint: their lives are waaaay better than ours).",

They even interviewed a few of the victims and asked them what happened and they spoke about it at length. This was all done to preserve evidence for the trials that were held to convict the lamas who had done such things. I watched it all on YouTube a few years ago.

LOL....\n\n>Why are they human drums and flutes and skin rugs that are in art museums all over the Western world (disgusting) that were all made after the laws were \"passed\" in the 1800s? \n\nFirst, what is disgusting about it? Second, go ahead and link an academic source saying they were made after the 1800's. Even the chinese historian Gu Jigang commented that the human bones and torture used were relics and not created by the current Tibetans. He then says that they were commonly used in slave and feudal societies including China. (Cited from Liu, The End of Revolution, p. 291). \n\n> Why are there Tibetans in their 80s and 90s who wrote about the horrid practices they witnessed before the Revolution?\n\nGo ahead and link their writings. \n\n>But again this isn't helping anything or anyone,\n\nIt is. I'm literally showing how you make all these claims and can't back them up. I'm also showing that you're getting *basic* history wrong. It's quite obvious that you again don't know anything about this. \n\n>. I hope someday you realize that all you're doing is pushing the narrative of a genocidal imperialist oligarchy intent on enslaving you and everyone you love and care about so that they can extract as much work from you until you're nothing but an empty husk all to make their imaginary numbers go higher.\n\nYes, this is what the Chinese is doing.\n\nAgain, come back when you can at least back up or source just *one* claim you've made :)",

Apparently in chinese factories, it's not uncommon to work 9am-9pm 6 days a week (hence the longer lunch breaks). The chinese users aren't describing 100% sunshines and rainbows like you're thinking. There's nuance.\n\nEdit: As another example, chinese users are jealous of our 40 hour work week. But their cost of living is much lower, so their wages can be stretched much farther like with purchasing food (which we describe as \"grocery hauls\").",

People are told that they can earn several thousand dollars per month washing dishes, that it's $1 for a meal from a restaurant, get 6 months paid maternity leave and cash payments when giving birth to a child, and that everyone can own a house here if they work for a few months. \n\nThe culture shock on xhs has been a two-way thing, Chinese are learning that life here in the west is much worse than they are told (ironically enough, their government media is too favourable and forgiving towards us), while Americans are learning that life in China is much better than they ever imagined, and indeed much better than many of them can even dream of ever having in the US.",

                            "body": "Cool, so let's also talk about:\n\nLegal slavery, via federal law, through the US prison system. Which is a private industry, not actually run/funded fully by the government and rampant with abuse and regular refusal of bare minimum health care. This is including, but not limited to, reasonable access to feminine hygiene products (no standardization and absolutely blanket not enough per inmate), having to pay for \"extra\" food as prisoners diets are lacking nutritionally, calorically, and often comprised of meals made from ingredient batches labeled as 'not for human consumption,' land poor to no medication management leading to significant issues in inmates with chronic illness. Recidivism is artificially inflated by lack of appropriate transitional care and funding for such programs, as well as the pervasive attitude that any record renders a person irredeemable. This disproportionately affects POC communities, which are frequently profiled and targeted for circumstances historically impressed on them.\n\nNative/Indigenous Americans and their lands. The US government is literally breaking treaty after treaty to claw back lands- see the pipeline in Lakota/Dakota/Dakota territory and the telescope on Hawaiian holy ground. There are still 4 government funded boarding schools open as of 2024 and CPS/DHHS dodges ICWA like it is a wrench in the movie Dodge Ball and even tried to repeal it. The \"60s Scoop\" was the US, not just Canada and it was not even the last time Native children were taken or required to receive government mandated education that stripped them of their culture and heritage. Children that went through boarding school in the 1800s and early 1900s could be married off to white families and stripped of native status entirely. That's not even the beatings, murders, rapes, etc in those hell holes, or the fact that Native children still face schools demanding they cut their hair, apologize for participating in and denounce their culture, and stop speaking the languages our peoples are desperately trying to revive or save. Then there are the MULTIPLE genocides starting from the first Spanish, English, and French colonizers that lasted straight through well into the establishment of the US, decimating 90% of the native populations in the name of \"Manifest Destiny\" and the firm belief that the \"savages\" had \"clearly stolen\" the land from civilized predecessors (often viewed to be Israelites or other Christian/white cultures) because they couldn't possibly have built the civilizations/structures they found as they took what they felt was theirs. \n\nHow about the internment camps in WWII. The ones the US government built for the \"Japanese\" but basically shoved any Asian American or Asian immigrants into them they thought might fit the bill? Women, children, the elderly, as well as men... No proof of affiliation with the Japanese government, just for the \"safety\" of white Americans. They were rounded up from their homes, only allowed to bring what they could carry in a suitcase, and relocated. Most never got their homes or other belongings back. George Takei has given first hand accounting of what living in one was like, just as a reminder of exactly how recent that atrocity was since I've rarely seen it mentioned in US history classes and I've taken several. \n\nThen there's the history the US has with African Americans/Black Americans and the continuation of Chattel Slavery long after even England was like \"Ehhhhhhh maybe that *wasn't* out best idea, oops,\" the persistent belief and treatment of them as being inferior or even subhuman well into the 20th century to the point that there were 'scientists' who devoted themselves to trying to prove it. The Tuskegee experiments. Jim Crow laws. The eugenics movement and deliberate, nonconsensual sterilization of young Black men and women- and anyone else they deemed unworthy. The targeting of young Black men and women by the police. Segregation literally up until the 60s/70s. American medical colleges, absolutely including ones receiving government funding, perpetuating that Black people and other POC don't feel pain in the same way and 'naturally' have a higher tolerance. \n\nAnd let's not pretend there aren't an abundance of Americans in completely dog shit working conditions, poor access to bathrooms/water/breaks/etc while corporate overlords skirt every single protection they can relying on employees fear, low wages, anti-union rhetoric and general lack of workforce protections knowledge to keep themselves out of trouble. Hell, when they do get caught the consequences are often negligible to the company's bottom line and it's resolved with a pay out and a couple scapegoats getting fired without real change. Nevermind how much is left to the states to determine how to burden the proof for those who do choose to move forward against employers breaking protections. We literally in the last 4 years have had states reducing child labor laws. \n\nI'd also like to remind you how the last 20-25 years of presidential elections have gone with at least 2 presidents losing the popular vote, iirc, and a literal insurrection/coup attempt on the capital. Nevermind the Primaries being a *joke* and the system being fully rigged to remove any candidate from making significant headway if they aren't the DNC/RNC chosen ones. You literally have to pay thousands of dollars to have your name placed on the state ballot- per state. Be *so* fucking for real right now. \n\nThe USA is literally a scifi dystopian Utopia novel come to life. Don't kid yourself. No one can sling mud and propaganda like the United States government because so many of our people eat it up and happily spit it back like we're the greatest thing ever.",

To further silence journalists, it accuses them of \u201cespionage\u201d, \u201csubversion\u201d, or \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d, three \u201cpocket crimes'', a term used by Chinese law experts to describe offences that are so broadly defined that they can be applied to almost any activity. Independent journalists can also be legally placed in solitary confinement for six months under \u201cResidential Surveillance at a Designated Location\u201d (\u201cRSDL\u201d) in China\u2019s \u201cblack prisons\u201d, where they are deprived of legal representation and may be subjected to torture. \n\nWow!!!! Just like the US!!!! The government I'm allowed to criticize like it's my personal hobby with absolutely no fear of any repercussions!!\n\nGet bent Nazi.",

I agree with that point. China censors people. Everybody knows that. The point is, why would the Chinese people that either know that they\u2019re being censored, or they plainly don\u2019t know, would be rooting for us because they know that we installed spyware? \n\nLike, it\u2019s either they don\u2019t know that it\u2019s spyware because they are censored, or that it wouldn\u2019t make sense for them to be rooting for us because they know that we would be subjected to the same censorship as them. So in either of the two, it makes no sense. Now, the only way this discussion would make sense is if you\u2019re claiming that they\u2019re all bots.

They are untrustworthy of [ML states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state). \n\nFor one, these states are known for idolizing work. In the Soviet Union, it was a[ crime to be jobless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_parasitism_\\(offense\\)) without some government approved reason. Even if what they are doing is based on truly thinking this is the path to stateless communism, maintaining civilizations built in this way (and with China the past 30 years, like a more extreme version of life in NYC, Chicago, London, etc.) is very work and resource intensive. Technology could automate some of that but it's still complicated and introduces a new problem where those in control of the technology would have power over the rest of the civilization that is dependent on it (see [left skepticism/criticism of high tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism)). \n\nToo many on the left also assume these countries are run by good intentioned diehard socialists that are on their side, that all the seemingly bad stuff has a purpose to help the western left. It's far more likely those running these countries are operating out of national (and personal) interest and not ideology though they can claim to align with whatever. Though some may believe whatever they think and do is actually the true socialism and the right way. Either way, it's more likely they would see the western left not as allies but part of the problem and fair game to be used to help weaken the US, along with the right, seeing the US and western countries as being the top opposition to their national and global interest.",

The guy from the video is fine and the only people that died were military and police. If you're on this sub you should already be questioning everything from a western capitalist source and yet all the bullshit they put out about China just gets a pass?\n\nMore about the Uyghurs: it's obviously not possible to hide a genocide so where is the evidence? There are thousands of videos and photos of the Palestinian genocide and nothing of the supposed Uyghur genocide. It's not possible to censor something that supposedly widespread. The US and other western governments have been doing everything in their power to suppress pro-Palestinian voices for decades (the genocide didn't start on October 7) and yet they are completely incapable of doing so. Furthermore, what was initially claimed as the genocide was just an anti-extremist government initiative in the region. You know how there are nazi enclaves in Idaho? What if the US government identified people in these enclaves and gave them the option to deprogram themselves or face jailtime? Would you cry foul about that? The \"Idaho Nazi Genocide\"? That's essentially what was happening in Xinjiang and it's embarrassing how many people fell for Adrian Zenz's sinophobic masturbation.

Taiwan is also a subject that could end in war or at least it's how i see it. But even then, r/genzdong was quaranteined here because it was too much anti west, so reddit is also \"totalitarian\". You must understand they are under attack much more than how much they attack the US. Just compare the news in each source and the ammount of lies that are throw at them. I wish there was 0 censorship but the CIA would 100% do what musk did with twitter with nazi bots and lies to desestabilize the nation. I'm sure they prefer rednote that way",

Yet neither is the American government, and you highlighting one over the other is self-serving at best. Saying \"you should be worried about American interference too\" as an afterthought highlights that perfectly. If you actually cared about both equally you would be saying \"this doesn't go nearly far enough to block US propaganda\" before anything else. \n\nMoreover I have over a century of American fuckery I can look back at, including direct interfernce with China. Now you'd like for me to take a hostile stance against China on Americas word that it's totally in my best interest? Funny how that always works out - America fucks around halfway across the world, the people being fucked with see America as an enemy after decades a decades of material impact to their lives, and America turns around and says \"look how they hate us for our democracy and freedom\".",

The borders have changed so much\" and \"well, is it really slavery if they couldn't be sold (but could be traded)\". \n\nBasically anything China has said about Tibet is listed as an allegation, even before the CPC took power. Then you get to the bit where it writes about mutilation as punishment near the very end, and you get very detailed descriptions of how people's arms and legs were cut off and their eyes gouged out, with a variety of Western and non-Westerns sources cited.\n\nOdd, that for any other example of serfdom or slavery, Wikipedia almost universally has a page titled \"serfdom in Nation\", and may have individual sections/callouts or dedicated pages for any relevant controversies. Yet Tibet gets a special treatment. The theocratic system, the system of serfdom/slavery, the practice of mutilation, all get one neat little page with sections like \"The idea of Tibet and the concept of serfdom\".",

That Tibet has not only been part of China as an autonomous region for centuries, but was a theocratic dictatorship complete with slavery and torture up until China did something about it **in the fucking 50s**? And just in case I need to spell this out for you - this meant the vast majority of the population was not only illiterate, but didn't have any contact with the outside world. \n\nThe Dalai Lama was born into that exact system of oppression and he fled the moment China actually said \"hey maybe don't enslave people and cut off their arms or gouge out their eyes as a form of punishment?\", all under a CIA operation that had - in advance - offered him a salary and US support? China even worked with the ruler priest class to enable to rule the nation, with the only major changes being no slavery, no oppression, and get people fucking literate. \n\nAlso fucking hilarious that you think the CPC is raiding average people's families because of shit like this. China has over 4x the population of America, and yet a prison population roughly on par with America's. Chinese state censorship is not anywhere near as impactful as you frame it. \n\nLike, do you actually know anything about China that wasn't directly spoon fed to you through corporate news, people quite literally on the CIAs bankroll, or fucking Shen Yuen?",

Ironic you say that was an authoritarian regime\u2026what\u2019s Tibet under now?\n\nThere wasn\u2019t slavery in Tibet. Go ahead and cite an academic source for this claim. If you\u2019re saying torture is judicial mutilation, this practice stopped before China invaded. But funny how China tortured thousands of Tibetans after they invaded. \n\nThe illiteracy rate was the same with neighboring countries including China.\n\nThe Dalai Lama actually worked with China and looked forward to reforms. He even asked to join the CCP. Oh by the way can you give another example besides Lungshar for eye gouging? Which Tibetan officials screwed up because they didn\u2019t know what to do and had to use old Qing texts. The Dalai Lama fled after there were rumors China was going to kidnap him. Oh and reforms started in eastern Tibet in the mid-50\u2019s. Him fleeing had nothing to do with reforms going to start..\n\nBut Tibetans are appreciative right? I mean that\u2019s why China needs to keep such an authoritarian and militant presence against Tibetans in order to control Tibet.\n\nYour last paragraph is ironic. Might want to self reflect. You know fuck all about Tibet but pretend you do. Go ahead and try and cite your CCP propaganda. I\u2019ll be able to refute all of it.",

An opinion that is quite literally the byproduct of a largely disclosed CIA operation, which is described as follows on its own dedicated Wikipedia page\n\n>It consisted of \"political action, propaganda, paramilitary and intelligence operations\" facilitated by arrangements made with brothers of the 14th Dalai Lama, who himself was allegedly not initially aware of them. The stated goal of the program was \"to keep the political concept of an autonomous Tibet alive within Tibet and among several foreign nations\"\n\nIf I saw something like this conversation in a movie I would think \"wow what lazy writing, that's so cliche\".

It\u2019s true that ByteDance needs to comply with CPC standards and that they\u2019re likely accessing their users data, but so are companies in the US and the US is also an evil superpower IMO. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to say, TikTok CEO was simping for where supremacists just like every other social media giant so we\u2019re banning them. But the hostile foreign government language was weird.\n\nU still supports banning tiktok on here because of what I said above, but I don\u2019t agree with the reasoning for it. \n\nEither way, I\u2019ve stopped using those social media sites now and only use messenger to communicate with my family abroad.\n\nThis is also a global sub, not everyone here is American.",

Or are you attempting to sidestep that comparison entirely.\n\n> I'm not a partisan so I'm not sure where the delusion would be coming from\n\nThe delusion is rejecting information that challenges your political worldview.

You've got Amazon workers pissing in bottles, child labor, practically no workers rights, and the exploitation of foreign workers in not only the world's richest nation, but one that's experienced centuries of relative stability.\n\nI hate to break the news to you, but one of these is nations is doing far better than expected, while the other is doing far worse. China has educated more people than the entirety of the US population over the past half century. It has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty. Meanwhile the literacy rate in America is 79%. China has less illiterate people than America, despite having over 4x the population.\n\nAmericans should be fucking taking notes.

The business class realized they didn't need the ruling class families anymore, and getting out from under the thumb of a tyrannical dictator does have its benefits--especially when there's actual democratic and fundamental human rights in place to counteract capitalism.\n\nYeah, no. Capitalism was directly birthed from the rise of the merchant class. A democratization of the means of production is about as far off base as you can get. \n\nMerchants acted as state-backed middle-men whose job was to trade goods in a rapidly shrinking world dominated by rapidly growing colonial empires. These empire's couldn't be as centrally managed as the smaller feudal states of the medieval era, and innovations in seafaring enabled longer and more lucrative trade routes. \n\nThe precursor to capitalism, mercantilism was quite literally build on the belief that the working class should be oppressed. Hardly a democratization of the means of production. Mercantilism transformed into capitalism as the first industrial revolution kicked into gear. A point by which the printing press had already existed for over 200 years, and access to information was rapidly threatening the ruling class.\n\nCapitalism has almost universally been defined by large monopolistic practices that were hardly any better than those present in the feudal economies of the past. Moreover, places like Ireland were completely ravaged by these \"more efficient\" practices in which the capitalists divided up the land to best suit cash-crops, and prevented the tenants from growing anything other than these cash-crops while still having to pay rent. This inevitably led to the potato-famine as the only food the Irish could afford to grow for their own sustenance were potatoes, which were devastated in the potato blight.\n\nYour whole framing of \"business class\" freeing themselves from the tyrannical rulers almost makes me fucking sick. I can't imagine what kind of closed education you must have had to hold such a patently false belief. You can pick any point in time since the inception of capitalism and find examples of labourers being exploited by a handful of elite capitalists who were functionally no better than the kings and queens that they often co-existed with.\n\n>You implying that China has done this all on its own is ahistorical, and reeks of tankies claiming the USSR was some juggernaut of innovation and prosperity, as if they didn't have countless number of gulags filled with slave labor all over Eastern Europe.\n\nAmerica literally houses like 25% of the worlds prison population, and also uses prison labor. \nWhat the fuck are you honestly on about?

When I said democratization in regards to the feudal class losing power, I was being tongue-in-cheek. That's why I said in a strict sense, as in the feudalistic ruling classes were over-invested in land as their wealth generator, which was losing power in relation to the wealth that merchants were gaining. As far as the working people were concerned, it was 'Under New Management' for them. I would hope that no one would think workers haven't been exploited, here or abroad under capitalism. My point is the US \\*does\\* have some fundamental human and worker rights in place that were fought for through social movements, that much of the world does not have. This in combination with education/free enterprise that is more unobstructed than that which a typical dictatorship provides leads to avenues of innovation and prosperity that cannot be discounted. This obviously wasn't as true before the rights were extended (mostly by force) to the working class, and does not include our economy monopolizing and oligarchs eroding our rights as we hit late stage capitalism. I'm endorsing democratic market socialism rather than capitalism. \n\n>  \nAmerica literally houses like 25% of the worlds prison population, and also uses prison labor.

I'm not saying that at all. Everyone in this thread implying that anyone critiquing the CCP must be in favor of the US as a whole, or is bigoted against other peoples is doing reactionary us/them thinking at best or simply bad faith side-stepping at worst. China currently being a dictatorship means that it's ruling class would rather have other democratic nations (or those that call themselves democratic at least) collapse to bolster its own regime's perceived role as indispensable rather than have to contend with an overworked and exploited citizenry that may opt for a different form of government if given an neighborly example to consider. The Chinese people aren't the ones that have final say over how their media algorithms on these apps are handled--that would be the CCP. In the US with Twitter, Meta, etc, the oligarchs have final say, as the past week has shown. They may even do away with any last pillars of democracy left in our system now that they pretty much ownl it. I don't trust the CCP just like I don't trust American oligarchs, because they all deal in authoritarian systems. That isn't even addressing how the profit motive incentivizes dopamine hits and how self-destructive this type of media is to people's minds in general. There's plenty of reasons to separate ourselves from these apps when possible and encourage others to do the same. \n\n>  \nAmerican industrialization started in the 18th century.

'Look how much food we have in our grocery stores', and the like. \n\nI didn't say America provided education to keep the people happy, happy =/= not rebelling. I'm saying there were opposing ideologies that they had to stop from spreading, and one of the ways is actually providing some benefits to living in society. That said, that was back when the US actually had a semblance of class consciousness left and still had FDR's New Deal policies in place, so there was some portion of the ruling class that had the sense to throw the working class a bone now and again. And companies were actually still innovating instead of cannibalizing. I think we would agree that's all but gone now.",

Everyone in this thread implying that anyone critiquing the CCP must be in favor of the US as a whole, or is bigoted against other peoples is doing reactionary us/them thinking at best or simply bad faith side-stepping at worst.\n\nThe point was that America didn't get to where it is overnight, and absolutely didn't do this without breaking the backs of countless groups and people's. Condemning China for lacking in certain aspects of the US doesn't help anyone. Just about all of the criticism directed at the CPC from Westerners is rooted in a belief that the CPC isn't legitimate and must inevitably collapse, rather than from a desire to see the government correct its failing and grow into something better. \n\nWhile yes, I do fully agree that we shouldn't trust the CPC any more than we should the American government, I don't agree with the proposition that the CPC is inherently a threat to itself and other nations by virtue of not being democratic. Democracy isn't a flower that blooms in a baren field. Democracy in of itself isn't necessarily a good thing. We have plenty of examples of democratic nations descending into state approved barbarism, and I'm sure I don't need to highlight the most famous example.\n\nThe liberal will always say that the failings of democracy are the failings of the constitution. That is a flawed assessment. A democracy is only as strong as its individual constituents. You can't protect a democracy from a constituency that wants authoritarianism, no matter how many safeguards and controls you have. So long as people continue to separate the idea of democracy from the foundations that support it, democracies will continue to fail. \n\nFreedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of mobility.. Yes, these are all core aspects of a functional democracy, but they are not its foundation. The foundation is a good quality of life and a robust educational system that isn't beholden to any financial or idealogical interests. \n\nIf your constituents are too busy trying to get through each and every day, you will never have a sustainable democracy. People in crisis prioritize their own immediate interests over everything else. They are easy to manipulate, and you will never convince them to suffer today for something as vague as they democracy or freedom - not unless they have already been radicalized.\n\nThe other aspect is education. This one should be obvious enough. People can't act in their own best interests if they don't know what those interests are. Once you have a functional and healthy democracy, a good system of education - one that is neither dedicated to the ideology of democracy, fascism, liberalism, or anything else, and one that isn't dedicated to generating wealth - is fundamental to maintaining that democracy. If people don't have the capability to understand their own objective reality, then they can not make rational decisions that control that same reality. \n\nThat means understanding the strengths of not just a democracy, but all other systems. That means the education system can't be dedicated to getting people to participate in the economy, but rather should be focused on creating individuals who can participate in the democratic process. That means ensuring the education system arms constituents with the ability to detect flaws in their democracy - ones that come from everything from wannabe fascists to aging systems of governance.\n\nEducation is one of the major reasons America has gotten to where it is today. Not only was it too focused on preparing people for the economy, but it also served to ideologically indoctrinate Americans. It created a majority that lived in a bubble, isolated from consequences of their own actions until those consequences were too difficult to ignore and the first foundation, their own quality of life was impacted.\n\nThis is also why it's entirely ridiculous to expect nations like China to be democratic. The nation is only now getting to the point where the foundation is solid enough to entertain the idea of a democracy. Yes, it's not great, but an impoverished and poorly educated population participating in a democracy is as dangerous as an authoritarian government. The earlier will either sabotage its own future, or descend into a much more hostile version of the latter. The latter may opt to destroy the foundations for a democracy rather than hand over power when the time comes. There is no winning in that situation, and the focus should always remain on improving the quality of life of the people rather than what arbitrary form the government takes.",

Direct democracy doesn't inherently guarantee anything good--no one goes into their neighborhood shopping center for their dental appointment and asks the quiznos worker, the dry cleaner, the macy's associate and the dentist to vote on how their root canal is done. The elephant in the room is that applies just as much to politics as anything else, and we have ignore it every election cycle. I've been thinking for a while now that democracy at large will only work if each subpart is itself a miniature model of the total system. The culture itself would have to honor and admire those that put in the effort to make the best 'cell' of democracy possible in your small community (you're only as strong as your weakest link). That would require people accepting that they'll have to work very hard to move their local community forward even a single step, and at best might get a statue of themselves in a small park somewhere if they are truly successful. Modern American culture is the complete opposite--everyone is fed power fantasies from a young age (Disney, superheroes, video games, etc.), everyone abandons their local communities entirely, are told that they're a main character destined for greatness, and that they should only focus on getting famous at the national stage and grinding their way to as much wealth as possible. It's pure narcissism dressed up as 'individualism'. What we're experiencing now is just as you said, the most narcissistic among us are making a power grab. If the appropriate organization of expertise and amount of power allocated to them isn't achieved, then authoritarianism is all that's left. It's a tough scale to balance.",

The CPC is actively working on transitioning to manufacturing high value goods, and that change should gradually improve working conditions as the job markets slowly shift from \"literally anyone with hands\" to educated professionals.

Formation of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\n\n>(vi) Centralisation of money and credit in the hands of the state through a national bank with state capital, and the suppression of all private banks and bankers.\n\n>(vii) Increase in the number of national factories,workshops, railroads, ships; bringing new lands into cultivation and improvement of land already under cultivation \u2013 all in proportion to the growth of the capital and labour force at the disposal of the nation.\n\n>(viii) Education of all children, from the moment they can leave their mother\u2019s care, in national establishments at national cost. Education and production together.\n\n>(ix) Construction, on public lands, of great palaces as communal dwellings for associated groups of citizens engaged in both industry and agriculture and combining in their way of life the advantages of urban and rural conditions while avoiding the one-sidedness and drawbacks of each.\n\n>(x) Destruction of all unhealthy and jerry-built25 dwellings in urban districts.\n\n>(xi) Equal inheritance rights for children born in and outof wedlock.\n\n>(xii) Concentration of all means of transportation in the hands of the nation.\n\n>It is impossible, of course, to carry out all these measures at once.

Once the first radical attack on private property has been launched, the proletariat will find itself forced to go ever further, to concentrate increasingly in the hands of the state all capital, all agriculture, all transport, all trade. All the foregoing measures are directed to this end; and they will become practicable and feasible, capable of producing their centralizing effects to precisely the degree that the proletariat, through its labour, multiplies the country\u2019s productive forces.\n\n>Finally, when all capital, all production, all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation, private property will disappear of its own accord, money will become superfluous, and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain.\n\nThat's what The Communist Manifesto says the general transition will look like--though it specifies it will be different in every country. That looks to be basically what's happening in China.

The global transition to socialism will likely take centuries, and happen in fits and starts, just as the transition to capitalism from feudalism did.\n\nAnd in the modern global connected world, you can't just go full communism on day one. The US (and the rest of global capital) will destroy you through coups, decades of illegal embargo, or straight-up war. We have dozens of examples of this.\n\nWhat you can do is leverage the socialist movements where they actually happen: in the periphery of the global system. And they can slowly build an industrial base until there is a tipping point.\n\nWe're almost at that tipping point. China went from a feudal backwater to the most important economy on the planet in less than 100 years (a pace of industrialization only matched by the USSR). The US, and the rest of the west, meanwhile, is collapsing into fascist impotence.\n\nWe will only see revolutions in the west if this collapse continues and the contradictions intensify. Though, more likely, we will see more fascism in the core because they still benefit from capitalist imperialism. The question becomes can the periphery become stable and self-sufficient enough before then. Will they be able to weather the storm of global fascism, and will the socialist movements in the west be able to defeat the fascists.\n\nIf socialism can win on the global stage, this is probably how it will happen--whether you like it or not, and whether Marx predicted it exactly or not.\n\nAnd if you're really going to needle in on purely economic equality as the sole marker of 'is this vastly complex, centuries-long global socio-political movement socialist or not', you need to at least acknowledge that maoism was a massive success by that one metric.\n\nMaoist China saw the largest and fastest increase in life expectancy in the history of the world.

China is an authoritarian state-capitalist country.\u201d\n\nthis is an oversimplification, either intentionally or due to your own personal ignorance. China\u2019s system is based on Marxist-Leninist principles adapted to their own conditions, called Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.\n\nwhen Deng Xiaoping introduced socialism with Chinese characteristics, the idea was to use markets strategically - not as an end, but as a means to build the material conditions for socialism.\n\nkey industries like banking, energy, and telecom are still state-controlled. market mechanisms are there to drive growth and innovation, but they\u2019re ultimately subordinate to state planning.\n\nlabeling this \u201cstate capitalism\u201d misses the fact that the market\u2019s purpose is tied to explicit socialist goals like eradicating poverty and strengthening the productive forces needed for further development.\n\n> \u201cSocialism is incompatible with authoritarianism.\u201d\n\n\nno. not really. this is another misunderstanding, of both socialism and authority.\n\nmarxism always recognized that the transition from capitalism to socialism isn\u2019t going to be peaceful or without authority. \n\nduring the dictatorship of the proletariat, the state plays a key role in dismantling the old ruling class and defending socialism from internal and external threats.\n\ncalling that incompatible with socialism ignores the realities of historical and material conditions.\n\nbuilding socialism is a process. it doesn\u2019t emerge fully formed; it has to struggle within a hostile global capitalist system. \n\nChina\u2019s governance isn\u2019t authoritarian for its own sake; it\u2019s a means of stabilizing the country and directing development in the face of massive challenges.\n\nbesides, if we\u2019re honest, every system relies on authority to maintain itself. this isn\u2019t unique to socialism, it\u2019s just hypocritical of you to dismiss this undeniable fact.\n\n> \u201cChina is actively engaged in ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nthis claim gets thrown around a lot, but the evidence doesn\u2019t really hold up to any scrutiny.\n\nmost of the claims come from heavily politicized sources, often tied to governments with their own agendas.\n\nin Xinjiang, for example, the Chinese government describes its policies as anti-terrorism and poverty alleviation efforts.\n\nit\u2019s a contested issue, and i\u2019m not there so i can\u2019t say for sure\u2026 but calling it \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d or \u201cgenocide\u201d requires proof of intent to destroy a group, which hasn\u2019t been shown convincingly under international law.\n\nit\u2019s also worth asking why these accusations are aimed at China, while Western powers with their own histories and current actions of ethnic violence get less scrutiny.\n\n> \u201cThey\u2019ve long left market socialism behind; it\u2019s squarely a state capitalist system.\u201d\n\ni really don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate. market socialism uses markets as a tool, not as an end in itself. in China\u2019s case, the state keeps control of major economic sectors while using the market to generate growth and develop infrastructure.\n\nlook at what they\u2019ve achieved: over 800 million people lifted out of poverty, massive public investments in things like healthcare and education, and collective ownership in rural areas, all in less than 100 years, and in the face of being demonized merely for existing for all of that time. \n\nsure, inequality and some capitalist elements still exist, but even Marx acknowledged that socialism arises out of capitalism and isn\u2019t immediately free from its contradictions. \n\nwhat\u2019s happening in China fits the idea of the primary stage of socialism, where material conditions are developed before moving further. you again, just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\n> \u201cNone of the so-called communist countries ever had a shot at developing real equitable utopian socialism; there was always a ruling class.\u201d\n\nhonestly, this whole \u201cutopian socialism\u201d thing is a strawman. Marx himself rejected the idea of a perfect society popping out of nowhere. \n\nsocialism is always going to be a transitional stage where classes and contradictions still exist, and the goal is to work through those.\n\nclaiming there\u2019s \u201calways a ruling class\u201d is misleading because it confuses state officials with a capitalist class. \n\nin a socialist state, those officials don\u2019t privately own the means of production or extract profit from labor. their role is supposed to serve collective public interests, even if execution isn\u2019t flawless.\n\nalso, let\u2019s not forget the external pressures these countries faced: embargoes, invasions, coups. acting like they failed solely because of internal issues completely ignores the hostile global context they operated in.\n\n> \u201cDenying this makes you a tankie, aka a Red Nazi.\u201d\n\n\u201ctankie\u201d is just a slur people use to dismiss anyone who defends socialist states. it is a thought terminating cliche intended to shut down conversation instead of engaging with the actual arguments. because what being a tankie really is, is being correct before it\u2019s socially acceptable to be so. \n\nand your \u201cRed Nazi\u201d comparison is actually fucking ridiculous. Nazism is based on nationalism, racism, and capitalist hierarchies, while socialism is about class struggle, internationalism, and dismantling exploitation. \nthe two couldn\u2019t be more different, they are diametrically opposed ideologies.\n\ncomparing them just shows a total lack of understanding simmering within reactionary rhetoric.",

That's how you end up dropping the tree on your own roof, or your neighbor's roof, or *a person.* You have to have a plan for disassembly.\n\nChina is successfully showing us what a transitory state looks like - obviously with plenty of missteps and pitfalls of its own. But the most critical thing right now is seeing that *no, life in that model isn't a fraction as bad as the McCarthyist rumor mill wants you to think.* People need to see that to shift the Overton window back toward the left, it is *instrumental* to international class consciousness and the kind of solidarity that *prevents wars* and improves material conditions. So this mod decision is either bafflingly incompetent at its most charitable or much more sinister if you don't blindly commit to the assumption of good faith.",

I agree with your last sentence completely.",

Different side of the same coin.\n\nPeople focus on it because it's a cultural touchstone. There's a very real chance a Chinese person's family was involved, to some extent, in some way, you're talking tens of millions of people protesting. Millions of soldiers. They react strongly because it's a tool used to de-legitimise the state. \n\nLike completely separate, but similar. You will find a lot of criticism for Stalin. Much of it is valid. You will never get it from soldiers that were in the Red Army during the war. They feel criticism of the man takes away from their experience. Even if they disagreed with him before. Tiananmen is a similar thing. A lot of people suffered for the modern PRC to exist. More than we can possibly comprehend in the West, hundreds of millions dead over the last century.

                                            "body": "* Powerful and Continuing Nationalism: You're never going to find a country where there aren't people proud of being part of that country.\n\n* Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights: Well if you look at articles that aren't published by the US State Department, like going over to see what China is up to yourself, [you find otherwise](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202407/t20240706_11449334.html). China is also responsible for the overwhelming majority of the global reduction in poverty.\n\n* Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause: ...who?\n\n* Supremacy of the Military: China's military budget has been pretty well tracking inflation, which means they're not really expanding its current size or operational envelope. In 2023 they also fired a bunch of high-ranking military leaders. \n\n* Rampant Sexism: [Is being legislated against, according to the USA itself](https://www.loc.gov/item/global-legal-monitor/2023-01-12/china-law-on-the-protection-of-womens-rights-and-interests-revised/). In terms of representation, 26% of China's Congress is women, which isn't great, but improving over time. In comparison, the USA is at 28%.\n\n* Controlled Mass Media: China does indeed forbid counter-revolutionary media, but that's not substantively different from other countries. When was the last time the NYT published a serious article about how capitalism should be replaced with socialism? Or WaPo, or HuffPost, or Fox, or CNN, or NBC, or MSNBC? If mass media being free is a concern, should probably look into that Sinclair thing.\n\n* Obsession with National Security: Most Chinese censorship measures are meant to diminish the effect and spread of capitalist propaganda. But they're not really militarizing their borders or obsessing about how many minorities are entering the country. \n\n* Religion and Government are Intertwined: No?\n\n* Corporate Power is Protected: CEOs are regularly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law because those with outsized power over others should bear consequences appropriate to the impact they have.\n\n* Labor Power is Suppressed: China has the most unionized workers of any country in the world, and while their One Big Union has been criticized for acting as a mediator between management and workers rather than an advocate of workers, it's also been instrumental in passing pro-labor laws. A work in progress but one that's improving.\n\n* Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts: China has more universities than any other nation and leads the charge on a number of research fronts because state funding isn't contingent on profit. China also funds art programs to further cultural development.\n\n* Obsession with Crime and Punishment: No?\n\n* Rampant Cronyism and Corruption: If you've been reading the news at all for the last few years it's basically unavoidable that you'd see a headline like \"China purges corruption in such and such committee\". Xi Jinping's whole thing early in his tenure was \"righting the ship\" and removing corrupt officials. I mentioned this in the military bullet point too.\n\n* Fraudulent Elections: The Communist Party of China is the only party that's allowed in elections, but it's hard to argue the elections are fraudulent because the nature of elections in China is to pick which member of the party will represent your community, and it's basically impossible to not personally know at least a few party members because the organization is so large. Local elections and politics are direct democracy, and at each subsequent level of organization that political body elects members to the next highest one, and so on to the National People's Congress. It's different from the American system or parliamentary republics but unless you're going to call one of them objectively the correct way to perform democracy all you can say is that they're different. 7% of the population of China are members of the CPC, which is extremely high. Voting for the Democratic Party doesn't make you a member of the party.",

While it can have a head for that government that isn't inherently corporate, such as a military officer, it is when corporations or those with capital (Such as the rich, upper class) take a direct approach to using the government. Rather than simply influencing policies, even if to a great extent, they directly decide those policies.\n\nChina controls its rich upper class by having control over their assets. In a manner of speaking, a rich person in China is only rich in China. Trying to subvert or sneak money away from this system is a form of fraud, and its punishment can include a death sentence. So, it is the opposite of a fascist government. That is to say, instead of corporations controlling the state and thus the people, the state, controlled through direct elections, control the corporations.\n\n It's style of economy is much like the New Economic Policy of the Soviet Union, though it'd probably just be easier to say it is a Socialist Market Economy. It has state ownership of many, if not most, large industries while allowing private ownership of many medium or smaller industries or enterprises. Workers have their rights enshrined in law to be able join workers' congresses/unions for both state and private businesses which gives them control over many aspects of work such as wages, the ability to supervise their leadership or even the ability to elect a director for their workplace. To tack on near the end here, 80% of Chinese businesses have a union or congress.\n\nSo, no, it's not Capitalist, nor is it fascist. It is a communist country building Socialism using a Socialist Market Economy under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.",

While in western countries they have more difference in between, though obviously, at the core all still mainly capitalist.\n\nI saw some of the news stories of billionaires functionally disappearing when stepping out of line, but that's because their expression of upper class solidarity is more of a unified front. Not for 'the state of the people' to be above them and have control over them, but for those in the class to be very strict. But if the state truly is above them for the sake of the proletariat, why do rich people exist at all? Why aren't that money simply given to workers?\n\nRegarding unions...everyone has a union...but it's the same one with big ties to the state. Independent unions are illegal. Workers are not allowed to consolidate local power among workers, it is all through the state. Most of the time it's a better thing to have more people represented under the same umbrella, but not legally being allowed to have unions in ways not permitted by the state limits what it can do. \n\nSo, a simple calculation would be that if my 2 points are true, that the rich control the state, and the state control the union...that means the rich control the workers.\n\nThere is a lot more to fascism than just state + capitalism. My preferred definition of fascism is [Umberto Eco's 14 features](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism). Not every fascist state has all them, nor do any one fully define one as. But that's why I said China is leaning into fascism, not that they are the most full blown psychotic fascists. Their nationalism and social conservatism though, that's way worse than most western countries. And opposition to the state is not allowed in any meaningful sense.\n\nDo you know about how the Uyghur muslims are treated in the west region of the country? Don't wanna write more of a comment and I simply don't trust you to be honest enough to not just dismiss whatever I refer to as ''western propaganda'' as a deflection. Or maybe it's completely real and it's part of glorious socialist solidarity.",

Nothing about the outcome, nothing about unofficial analysis that is in any way critical. idk really anything about OIC, but I see it covers countries with 1.6 billion people. If heavily supported by though countries, that also means there are a lot of big states with big business ties to the chinese state. Uyghur muslims do not at all have power as a people that rivals countries. If some rich oil states were to choose between covering for china to keep business going and calling out genocidal acts, what's your bet on?\n\nNot gonna read 27 pages on it now, but word-searching only brought up china in that one part. 'uyghur' never mentioned.\n\nA story of economic cohesion related to my country I remember from when I was younger was how when a chinese civil rights activist and philosopher (Liu Xiaobo) got the Nobel Peace Prize, China responded with sanctions driving down economic activities. Following that there was an increase in voting along with them compared to before. Economic pressure works to silence opposition. [Link](https://www.cmi.no/publications/6354-too-big-to-fault#:~:text=In%20October%202010%2C%20the%20Norwegian,products%2C%20and%20limiting%20diplomatic%20interaction)\n\n>Rohingya Muslim Community in Myanmar, which the West was relatively silent on.\n\nFully agree with Myanmar being fucked politically after the coup and civil war...but why the fuck did you mention it? In not a single one of my comment has there been any support of the western action towards muslim nations, so why did you bring it up? Still hung up on me being totally drowned in state department talking points? smh smh.\n\nI read the UN HRC letter...what the fuck was that? Seemed like straight out of a neocon war-or-terror propaganda piece. ''We had to but this group in camps because of terrorism, but don't worry, we are nice''. Idk...did you think that mentioning who is in support of it (nation states BTW, not my fav), that I'd agree that the chinese state is now good? Probably possible to find something I, as an strict atheist with anything more consequential than personal belief, would find abhorent from the Uyghurs. But none of that would get me to endorse re-education camps.\n\nI also didn't mention the word genocide. I don't think it was a full-blown mass extinction of a population, but it had lots of the traits of being more of a cultural genocide. There is a difference, but both are valid terms that deserve use in different situation. Re-education camps aren't just a pause-room to let people calm down from radicalization. It takes people from a culture, and stamps out that culture. The discussion was about fascism, and conformity to the state's culture and a strict lack of diversity is very much a feature of it.\n\n>Even the U.S. State Department's legal experts admit as much:\n\nAgain...I don't care. The american state department is not my master. It's you who are referring to them. Stop shadowboxing.",

And therefore I don't think that disliking their government is racist, just like disliking the American government isn't racist either.\n\nThere are definitely people that dislike the CCP because of racist reasons, and there is definitely American propaganda against China (social credit, as you mentioned, is a good example of that). We might just consume different medias, but most of the time when I hear others criticise China it's their government specifically, and not their people (except when people talk about tourists, but to be fair people do the same when they talk about American tourists).\n\nI don't even know what \"the projects\" that Beijing supposedly blew up is, but I can tell you that US propaganda is not the only reason why people dislike the Chinese government. If you decide to boycott something affiliated with the CCP because of US propaganda or because of racism, that's obviously bad. Doing it because it's an authoritarian country that doesn't support human rights and engaged in imperialism in recent times isn't bad, nor is it racism. That was my entire point.\n\nBtw, when you give examples of the US being bad, don't list them sanctioning Russia as an example, that is actually a good thing they did. Instead, mention their embargo on Cuba or something like that.",

I'm not trying to debunk China being 'bad' or 'good', I have no interest in value judgements based on anyone's own morals, because that's typically bound by our own culture and ideas of what nebulous ideas such as 'freedom' constitutes. As we saw from the exodus to RedNote, many Chinese netizens view the US as being a place lacking freedom, due to car dependency, rampant medical debt, commodification of housing, etc. It really depends who you ask.\n2. The 'I don't have anything against Chinese people, just their government' line is often just a facade. I'm not saying it is that way for you, but it's what you generally see with anti-China pundits (e.g. Drew Pavlou, Adrian Zenz, Tom Cotton, etc.), they use some faux concern for the Chinese people, but then you peel back a layer and they are horrifically sinophobic. People often say the same thing about Iran or North Korea - 'I just want them to be free', but what you are doing there is giving your consent to a deepening of hostile actions against them by the U.S. (E.g. further sanction or even an escalation of the ongoing Korean War). In a sense, a 'useful idiot' as some people say.\n3. The Projects is low-income public/subsidized housing. It's a popular expression: \"Bin Laden didn't blow up the Projects\", referencing the fact that U.S. workers were essentially swindled into supporting the War on Terror against their own interests. I found it fitting in this case. Workers in Europe and the U.S. are having their attention turned toward the 'tyranny of the CCP' to justify increasingly hostile foreign and economic policy globally, even when it hurts their own class interests.\n\nCountries being given breathing room to develop economically is only a good thing for U.S. workers, not only will it mean the U.S. can no longer sell off American labour to third-world underdeveloped countries (that they ensure stay underdeveloped), but it will ensure that the U.S. must compete with these newly developing countries, or risk a brain drain or labour drain more broadly. Part of the reason the British got the N.H.S. was because Clement Atlee (the Prime Minister at the time) needed to compete with the USSR. Part of the Americans got the New Deal from Roosevelt was, again, because the U.S. had to compete with the USSR. The collapse of the USSR, for better or worse, has objectively led us to a situation where wages and workers rights have got worse, and trade union membership has shrunk massively as the worker movement globally has been decimated.\n\nThat's why it hurts to see a pro-worker subreddit falling into the anti-China trap. It's not a big deal, really, just wanted to share my perspective.",

I don't think I fully agree with you though, because I can't just overlook my personal value judgements completely, because if I follow down that line of thought I would eventually not be able to criticise any action from a moral perspective. Obviously that doesn't give us carte blanche to stop any action that goes against our values, and we should obviously accept that different cultures have different morals to some degree, but I think that Russia is a country that goes against our morals in a unique and extreme way. It is a nation that has all the potential to be just as rich as the rest of the west, or at least the post-soviet Europe, but instead Putin and his oligarchs hoard their wealth and sacrifice their young to die in a foreign land for Putin's own personal imperial ambitions, while genociding the Ukrainian people. That is something that I think should be stopped, including through sanctions. But I can definitely see your argument for why we shouldn't be too anti-China, because I think that this argument of their values being different from ours is  a lot more applicable to them. I'm not an economist so this is something I definitely could change my mind on, but I don't think I support economic sanctions on China. Instead I would prefer if we try to improve our own manufacturing and ecnomies to compete with them in that way. I had not thought about the US having to compete with China leading to the US having to improve their labour conditions though. That is an interesting argument, and if true, even more reason to not be too anti-China.",

If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime's atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn't go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom.

I have lived in Shenzhen since 2017 and go to Hong Kong usually at least once a month. I was there, on the street, during the riots. And I use that term not because it\u2019s Beijing\u2019s term, but because that is exactly what I saw with my own two eyes. I saw black clad Hong Kongers smash in the screens of any mainland branded atm, and smash mainland bank windows. Saw them throw molotovs at MTR stations. Saw them graffiti everywhere up and down Nathan Road. Saw them chiseling up bricks from the sidewalks and piling them up in the streets. Saw them charge police with pipes and sporting equipment before police had taken any aggressive action (water canons, tear gas, etc.). When students holed up in the university and police attempted to enter, the students shot at them with bows and arrows. \n\nAnd let\u2019s remember it was Hong Kong police taking action against them. The PLA, People\u2019s Armed Police, etc. never entered HK. Beijing set some to SZ and told Carrie Lam (then Chief Executive of HK) they were at her disposal if she requested them, but differed to her judgment. She did not call on them. She kept the handling of events internal to Hong Kong.",

A Hong Konger took his pregnant girlfriend to Taiwan, murdered her and the unborn baby there, then returned to HK and confessed. He couldn\u2019t be arrested in HK because the crime occurred outside its jurisdiction and he couldn\u2019t be extradited to Taiwan for trial because HK had no legal mechanisms for doing so. He had found a loophole. So the HK legislature proposed\u2014not enacted, just proposed\u2014a law that would create a mechanism for a case-by-case possibility to transfer fugitives to \u201cany jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty\u201d in order to fix that loophole. China had NOTHING to do with any of that. The protests started in opposition to that proposed law, because it meant it was possible that fugitives who had committed crimes in China could be returned to China for trial. \n\nThey were peaceful protests at first. And literally less than a week after a peaceful march against the bill, the bill was suspended in the legislature. That bill btw was never enacted, and ultimately fully withdrawn. But the protesters also demanded Lam step down for even proposing the bill, added unrelated demands, and quickly grew violent. Making a reasonable demand, marching peacefully, and having the government take action on that demand is exactly how protesting should work. Turning violent and destructive when the government refused to listen to less reasonable demands (Lam\u2019s resignation) and firebombing civil infrastructure, targeting private businesses based purely on their country of origin, and refusing to stop until everyone arrested for those violent acts got full amnesty? Show me any country in the world which would accept that.\n\nOh, and remember the murder that started all of it? Because of the scrapping of the bill under the protests, he went free. He\u2019s at large now and faced nothing more than some minor detention over money laundering charges related to the murder. After the bill was withdrawn, the murderer volunteered to go to Taiwan and surrender to Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan refused, saying they wouldn\u2019t do so without full, formal judicial assistance from Hong Kong, doing so because the DPP government wanted to strengthen its pro-independence bona fides in the months leading up to the presidential election. The DPP claimed, without any evidence whatsoever, that his willingness to just surrender was a Chinese trick (the murderer was a permanent resident in HK, but was originally from Shenzhen) to weaken Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty by denying them an opportunity to formally negotiate with HK. The Taiwanese opposition and large segments of Taiwanese society excoriated them over this for politicizing a judicial issue and allowing a murderer to go free to score cheap points.",

This is a very large part of why there was so much agitation.\nhttps://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/mscas/vol2015/iss2/1/\n\nYou could basically sum up the situation as HKers feeling that their issues were all the result of mainlanders exploiting them, when in fact the provisions of the agreement for the handover insisted that HK retain most of its political structure for 50 years. That structure never was democratic as it was a colony right up until the handover, so naturally it had extremely colonial governing structures that benefited landowners who acted as your bog standard colonial indigenous middlemen managers. The point of contention really was that the HK government essentially was run by the landowner oligarchs who squeezed the average HKer to death, and they rightfully were angry. The issue is that they decided to blame the mainlanders for the problem rather than their own government, instead choosing this narrative that they had the superior democratic will and mainlanders were invading colonizers.\n\nEver since the riots ended, a lot of these protestors have left, while those who remained, especially non-protesting HKers, have become a lot more patriotic. This is because most HKers never spent a minute on the mainland so they were engaged in mythmaking about the evil outsiders, but once those barriers came down and they spent a few months exploring nearby Shenzhen, people have become far more engaged and conciliatory towards the mainland. This is coincidentally the same thing that is happening in Taiwan, which is why Gen Z Taiwanese are diverging heavily away from the independence folks, while Millennial Taiwanese have had all the typical anti-China brainwashing that paints mainlanders out to be horrific people in their primary and secondary school textbooks.\n\nFeel free to research this on your own, but you really have to question why, within the span of about 10 years, HKers and Taiwanese who were once famous for pushing the Chinese identity globally (especially for us diaspora) suddenly switched to extreme hostility towards a Chinese identity and started waving all these US/UK flags.",

Tibet wasn't a part of China until \\~1720s, and there's a major disparity between ethnic Han and Tibetans (for example, the party secretary in Tibet, the most powerful political position in Tibet ever since annexation, has been Han Chinese despite the ethnic Tibetan majority). It's also worth mentioning that the Tibetan \"child-pope\" was initially allowed to stay in power as a CCP puppet before the CIA-backed revolt happened.\n\nOn Taiwan, the policy that they're the Chinese government-in-exile was a holdover from the KMT dictatorship years. The ruling DPP party wants independence but only avoids it because in the PRC's perspective, it would constitute as a declaration of independence and obligates military force.\n\nI think the rhetoric about the CCP that you see in the US is often exaggerated and hypocritical, but that doesn't mean the PRC's policies are justifiable.",

You can also use Google and DuckDuckGo. I gave you brief info you needed to easily find what you\u2019re looking for without all the needless nonsense I\u2019m typing now.\n\nYou can also search on Reddit and will get hits, although mods have removed some already while they were gaining traction. I liked the posts and they are gone so I wouldn\u2019t even know where to revedit them.\n\nYou can also try searching things in TT. Try searching things with hashtags like fuckbiden, banned books, and you will get tons of things. But type a hashtag for fucktrump and you will get nothing or literally hardly anything. And if you type Nazi or Nazi salute you will get a blank results page with a \u201cfriendly message\u201d telling you to do research on the topic instead of just posting vids on the app made for vids.\n\nThings such as protestor walk against Trump also were not being displayed. Even big brands like BenandJerrys weren\u2019t getting as much traction on these protests as you\u2019d think considering this controversial stance from a major manufacturer.\n\nThe CA wildfires are almost entirely being recommended as videos from major news outlets despite the number of people who just take videos from there phone and post to TT. You can find the vids from users still, but they are not present like they used to be.\n\nSame point as above but for drone footage. Even if most vids were BS balloons, aircraft, or AI, the content is being moderated by stuff the ruling class has recently displayed controversial topics on. \n\nI will not give you more sources.

Lots of key technologies of the modern era are now dependent on semiconductors, including computer chips, but also solar panels, which are made of the same thing. \n\nBetween green energy investments, and diplomatic overtures through their international infrastructure projects, they\u2019ve begun exercising a strong soft-power push that complicates the US\u2019s global trade interests.

I made my account in China before it was banned there. \n\nMost people don't understand what it's like to live in a country with thousands of years of contiguous history. Americans can't relate at all. The important thing to remember is that China only really cares about China. That isn't a bad thing. I remember when Trump let Erdogan's thugs beat up American citizens during his first term and thought \"man, China would have put those thugs in their place.\" \n\nBut conversely, China does not forget sleights against them. None of you for example probably remember the First Opium War. It was a blip in history class. In China, it marks the Century of Humiliation, an era when China was manipulated and carved up by Western powers--and Japan. When I say the country *has not forgotten and never will*, it is an understatement. The entire paradigm on which China operates now is called 'National Rejuvenation', in which China recovers from this humiliation and takes its rightful place as center of the world stage. \n\nBut implicit in this is a historical resentment that most in the West don't understand. So as the West (England or the US it doesn't matter, it's all 'The West') filled China with opium, China fills the West with fentanyl and TikTok. For some, it's just business. But there are certain elements in China who see those particular items as poetic justice.",

That's the concern about platforms like TikTok, the fact that companies in China are legally beholden to the whims of the CCP and they have a direct line to the average American voter.

Facebook is the reason that a substantial portion of papaws across the country have had their brains poisoned by propaganda spewing AI generated Jesus videos.

                    "body": "When I arrived there I exercised an abundance of caution - due to things I\u2019d been told and impressions I\u2019d had - but as time went on I realised how a lot of that was way off the mark.\n\nThe first time (for me) when the cracks really started to show, was sitting in a cafe in a shopping mall in Xidan with a Chinese friend, when - glancing at the face on the Renminbi note I had received in change - she started asking me if I knew who Mao Zedong was, and what my views were on him. I looked around nervously, and asked her if it was fine to have this conversation in such a public place. She laughed and thought that was really funny. (In answering her enquiry, I chose my words carefully; her own point of view was that Mao was a bit of a \u201ctyrant\u201d, and had perpetrated some stuff that wasn\u2019t good for China)\n\n(For clarity\u2019s sake, I should state that all these conversations were in Mandarin.)\n\nI came to realise that Chinese people complain about stuff _all the fucking time_. Their co-workers, their boss, the government, some or other celebrity (or politician) who had been caught up in a scandal of something. Having a drink among friends, all bets are off.\n\nThe exceptions are around superiors, and people who are party members. Not because you\u2019re going to suffer any immediate repercussions, but more because party members tend to have superior positions and better leverage within an organisation, so it\u2019s just better strategy to stay on their good side.\n\n(A girl I dated briefly was a party member. We met in a piano practice studio. She had a CCP mousemat, which I thought was really funny.)\n\nThe game changes when you achieve a platform and a following. Once you hit **10k** followers on Weibo (and, presumably other services), you\u2019re required to register at your local police station within 30 days. At that point they will have your name and address associated with your account/handle, so you can expect to be under stricter scrutiny.\n\nBut for regular users (i.e. <10k followers) it\u2019s all a bit more loose. On the anniversary of 6/4 one year, another Chinese friend of mine (this slightly nuts punk rock girl) posted a Lego diorama recreation of the iconic \u201cTank Man\u201d photo on WeChat Moments (apparently attempting to post the original photo would be immediately auto-detected and taken down, but a Lego representation managed to fool the automated censors). The post stayed up for about an hour and then got taken down. But that was about it. Nothing else happened to her. There\u2019s no hard link between your internet accounts and your identity anyway, until you do the whole police registration thing (at the 10k follower mark).\n\nPersonally, I still didn\u2019t really go out of my way to initiate political/ideological discussions - probably more out of good manners than anything else. And when such discussions _did_ happen, they would often be rife with references to certain politicians by name, or some or other law that had been passed, or local/regional issue that I wasn\u2019t really well-versed enough in to contribute (though I would build up a more comprehensive understanding of the politics of the time later).\n\nAnother thing that impressed on me was the speed and spread of information. I was there in Beijing at the time of the terrorist car bomb attack in Tiananmen Square, in 2014. Within hours, the Great Firewall blocked off the specific article page of any news site reporting on it (at that time you could still open BBC News and I think CNN too without a VPN).\n\nI used a VPN to follow the reporting as it unfolded, and the next day I went to work thinking I had all this \u201cforbidden\u201d info that I could tell my Chinese counterparts. But to my surprise they already knew far more about the event than I did! No internet firewall can stop or even slow the speed of Chinese gossip (and yes, everyone knows about the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, and the subsequent violence around Beijing).\n\nI want to be clear I\u2019m not writing this with any pro nor anti agenda, nor trying to sugarcoat anything - there is a lot of fucked up shit that goes on under the guise of \u201cnational security\u201d - and I deplore it. One of my Chinese teachers told me how a neighbour of hers - an iconoclastic author - had been arrested and jailed for (she suspects) his writings (again, it\u2019s having a platform and a following that makes this stuff dicey).\n\nBut the idea that regular Chinese people live their lives in meek silence, cowing in fear under the government\u2019s authoritarian presence is\u2026 nonsensical. Chinese people are a hoot, and unabashedly vocal about all manner of topics. They know the game and how to play it. The more fruity side of the Chinese internet plays out as a game of cat-and-mouse between users and the information security forces - using euphemisms and homonyms to make reference to certain political figures, and funny memes to criticise them.\n\nOkay, your other question was work environment. Generally I found this to be pretty nondescript. Young Chinese change jobs a LOT. It was not uncommon for someone to be there like two months, and then jump ship when they got offered a better deal elsewhere, and this was just accepted with a shrug and was never a big deal (though I\u2019m not sure if the same is true today what with rising unemployment).\n\nWork hours could sometimes run long, but it wasn\u2019t prescriptive. If people had a lot of work, they\u2019d sometimes stay late to finish it, but I never got the feeling that was vastly different to other countries and companies where I\u2019d worked. The only part I truly didn\u2019t care for were the long-ass meetings. Meetings where everyone would gather and listen to some senior person waffle on for two, three hours or more sometimes. People would just keep working on their laptops, or play with their phones, and I\u2019ve definitely seen people snoozing in them as well. It never seemed to me like anyone was actually listening. It just felt like some collective drudgery we all had to endure together. There\u2019s this concept of \u201c\u5403\u82e6\u201d (\u201ceat bitterness\u201d), which lionises _suffering_ as some kind of virtue. Maybe that was the point of those never-ending \u201cmeetings\u201d - some shared bitterness to dine on. I dunno.\n\nBeijing is an amazing city, with so many awesome places to explore (spent many a wayward night in Sanlitun - sadly becoming a bit more sanitised and gentrified now - as well as Houhai, Wudaokou, Shuangjing, and the hutongs of Nanluoguxiang) and I thoroughly enjoyed my two years there. Since the pandemic blew over, I try to visit at least once a year. A lot has changed\u2026 it\u2019s a good deal cleaner and more modernised - and I\u2019d go so far to to say that some of its grimy charm has been lost - but there\u2019s still a lot to like about it.\n\nAdapting to China life was far from easy. My first half-year there - unaccustomed to the food and the culture - was particularly difficult, and I\u2019m sure I came close to pulling the plug a few times. And there are no shortage of things I could list that don\u2019t vibe with me - the maddening amount of bureaucracy, when you need to do anything official, for example. Plus I have my own opinions on the leadership and political systems\u2026\n\nBut to speak of the culture, the vibes, the people, the places - the wholeness of the experience of living in China - I cherish every single memory.",

Same goes for women who are above a certain age and don\u2019t have children. \n\nDisability? Huh? You get nothing, and you better be happy with that. Btw also no healthcare, if you have a terminal illness and can\u2019t pay for treatment you\u2019ll be shown the door very fast. I personally know people who have been denied treatment because their family couldn\u2019t afford paying for it. All treatment in Chinese hospitals has to be paid in advance BTW. \n\n\nYou have successfully been brainwashed and lied to. Congratulations.",

Banning it now is like trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube. \n\n- Has TikTok done anything to imply it's an unreliable source so far? I actually trust it much less if a U.S. oligarch takes it over. Imagine if Mr. Beast owned and controlled TikTok. Would you trust it then? \n\n- Reddit's collective banning of Twitter as a source feels like a way to hit Elon financially because they're mad he did the salute. But isn't the salute one of the *least* Nazi-like things he's done lately? I mean... dude's been a bad guy for a while. I feel like if you didn't know Elon was a Nazi, you weren't paying attention. \n\nAnd anecdotally, there's a ton of unfiltered U.S. leftist content on TikTok that this subreddit will be missing now that it's banned.",

            "body": "No worries.\n\n>Platforms affiliated with the CCP, such as TikTok and Rednote, because China is a hostile foreign government and these platforms constitute information warfare\n\nThis is it if we are to assume the mods are acting in good faith (e.g., they're not just infiltrated).\n\nIt is problematic.\n\n1) 'China is a hostile government' to whom? I would vouch that most of the world disagrees with this, and much of the world would see the US as a much more 'hostile government' than China is. The US President is threatening to invade Denmark, Panama, and Canada at present, and Musk has also gone on about invading the UK on Twitter, too. Aside from that, the US and senior US officials (including, but not limited, to, Musk) are openly destabilising various countries and trying to boost far-right, fascistic, and anti-democratic forces throughout the world. Namely: the AfD in Germany and Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (aka Tommy Robinson) here in the UK. More significant is the US's long standing policy of interventions in the global south which continue to the present day, such as its strangling of Cuba, its support for the 2019 coup in Bolivia, its illegal invasion of Iraq, its support for the GCC crushing of protestors in Bahrain, its support in organising and legitimising the 2013 coup in Egypt, its toppling and destruction of the Libyan state, its support for Saudi Arabia's artificial famine and invasion of Yemen, its support for military juntas in Latin America for decades, its support for genocide in Indonesia in the 60s, and so on and so forth. I could give a vast number of examples.\n\nThis is very Americo-centric, and I see no reason why US geopolitical interests have anything whatsoever to do with a 'global' subreddit that is dedicated to criticising capitalism across the world? It's absurd. If Americans want to see their class enemy, they should look closer to home, not half-way across the world.\n\n2) There is not much evidence that \"these platforms constitute information warfare\", or that the Chinese government has intervened over what Americans/westeners see on TikTok. I don't use it myself, but it's very easy to find, say, pro-HK stuff on there. If you search \"Hong Kong protests\", it's all anti-China and pro-HK, for example. If there has been any algorithmic manipulation or censorship, it seems insignificant, and certainly no more than the already confirmed censorship and manipulation that leaks (e.g., from Snowden) have shown western intelligence agencies doing.\n\n3) I would say the average westerner, ESPECIALLY the average American, is more threatened by their own government than from China's. China cannot really harm or influence the average person living in Europe or the US that much at the moment (perhaps this would change if they invaded Taiwan because of the latter's position in strategically important global supply chains-but this is not unique at a time when the US is threatening to invade multiple countries and has invaded multiple others in our lifetime), whereas our own governments can and regularly do harm us. I mean just look at the recent Executive Orders Trump passed. Shall we also ban every US social media site, considering they're all owned by capitalists and generally push a pro-US view + are clearly influenced by intelligence agencies here?",

So for the USA to do that to their _allies_ should have been damning.\n\nFurthermore, the USA has an extensive history of \"meddling\" - to put it politely - in the affairs of other countries, up to and including setting up coups and assassinations (I'll link to the [CIA's official declassified archive here](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/historical-collections), so everyone can have a look for themselves and not just take my word for it). Despite that history, billions of people use American-made products and services _and have **no** problem with ordinary Americans._ They're just trying to live their lives the same as us.\n\nSo I have to ask: how deep will this CCP-affiliated purity test go?",

Portraying the ordinary people of China as this gross cheating, thieving, dirty, selfish, and ugly minded culture. I dont agree with their government one bit but the dehumanization of Chinese people on reddit has gotten more blatant and casual. This has always been to create division between two very large nations so that those in power (Trump, Xi, Elon, etc...) could manipulate us. I have no doubt the CCP says similar things about Americans which are similarly untrue. China isn't the enemy and neither is the US, powerful billionaires are.

Literally one of the main reasons the US government wanted to ban tiktok is because they were afraid that the platform was turning people against the US. And it IS, but not because of Chinese propaganda. It\u2019s because of how many Americans are having discussions about the harms of capitalism. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve been on Xiaohongshu for the past week and basically every interaction between Americans and Chinese people is some version of \u201cDo Americans really have to pay for ambulances? Do Americans really get no paid maternity leave? Are Americans who work full time really not able to afford rent? Why doesn\u2019t your government help you?\u201d And Americans going \u201coh my god, is this not normal????\u201d Many Americans have already been radicalized against capitalism and the US government by seeing how other countries can live on both tiktok and Xiaohongshu.",

I\u2019m sure they are influenced by the US, but if they were completely captured they would not straight up be calling the Palestinian genocide, well, genocide- especially when the United States government has made its express position time and time again to support the apartheid state",
