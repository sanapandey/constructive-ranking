We want to do things in our leisure. And many of those things are quite complicated and expensive, requiring massive inputs of resources and effort to produce. Many of the fastest growing industries of the last two hundred years have been focused on our leisure.\n\nBut at the same time it's also clear that industry and capitalism have influenced society to devalue leisure and portray leisure as morally bankrupt. Those values are tightly woven into our culture now. So increasingly we strive for more work, and in particular more work in what can only really be described as bullshit jobs that serve no real purpose to better human society in any meaningful way.",

I don't think automation has cost jobs overall; rather, it has redefined the roles workers must take.  Those ordering kiosks at your favorite fast food joint?  They had to be manufactured.  They also have to be serviced and maintained.  In fact, there is SO much work to do that we need to import labor.\n\nAlternatively, plenty of people live offgrid inexpensively, and spend their time raising food, making YT videos, creating art, etc.  So the amount of time you spend working is related to the lifestyle you want.",

We also need shelter, and depending on our environment, most likely some kind of temperature control.\n\nThat's it.  That's all we really need.  The problem is, the best method we've come up with to distribute all those resources makes the air dirty, the water dirty, and reduces the amount of food that lives on the planet naturally. Maybe someday in the future we'll have the technology necessary to correct these issues.  But we don't know what that technology is or when we'll have it.  So it would be unwise to not do anything and just wait and see. \n\nSo what's all that mean?  It means, when we look at a timeline of our future... Looking at earth like it's an aquarium, and doing the math.  With this system, how long do we have until there aren't enough resources for everyone?  Well, it turns out, relatively speaking, not long. \n\nSo what factors could we adjust to correct this right now with the technology we have today?  We could increase our resources, or decrease our population. That's it.  And guess what?  We can't increase our resources.  So what's that leave?\n\nNo world leader wants to come out and say, \"It won't be long til we don't have enough resources for everyone.  We're getting closer and closer to fishing out the oceans every year, and when that happens, it's all over.  And, all over the world we've been farming the same land for generations.  The soil is dying.  There aren't enough nutrients left to feed our crops.  That doesn't even factor climate change, or our pesticides, or the fact that we're growing the same crops everywhere which makes them susceptible to disease.  Our system is unsustainable.\" \n\nSo instead of killing a few billion people, they're changing the rules of the game.  Resources are now far more expensive.  They're making us compete harder for our share.  Some folks will be left with nothing.  But at least it's up to each one of us whether we compete or not.  They're giving us a chance.  And they don't want to just come out and say what's happening, because that would freak everyone out. \n\nThe rich are in a great situation. They're not stuck in one country. Resources are worth more now.  The men that step in and make the hard decisions that make life harder for the rest of us will ensure they're survival.  And we don't know what the future of humanity looks like.  But all signs point to bleak.  So now is a pretty good time for the rich and powerful to quite tiptoeing and start hard stepping.  And that's exactly what they're doing.  There's more at stake for them now than there ever has been.  The difference between one billion and ten billion could be very important.  They're not taking any chances.  They're competing.",
