He couldn\u2019t absorb oxygen, and suffocated while still breathing. \n\nThe people in this area are exposed to so many harmful chemicals and have no choice. They are proud of their heritage in the region, a unique blend of Texan independence and Cajun tradition. Many aren\u2019t willing to leave a region that had been their home for centuries. Some of the only jobs that bring money in from outside the region are the refinery and chemical plant jobs.

I have literal damage to my DNA because of chemical exposure through no fault of my own. Many of my friends kids are born with rare genetic diseases. Many people die before they're 70 from multiple cancers at the same time.\n\nI did this article with a Pulitzer prize winner the week before COVID lockdowns started. My town is now in our 9th year and second NJ State Attorney General, trying to get Dupont to just CLEAN UP THE MESS THEY LEFT over the last century+. Their legal acrobatics by spinning off their most liable divisions into their own companies to sweeten the merger with DOW chemical, only to unmerge with DOW in the end and no longer liable for the damages their company caused is heinous. They are responsible, Chemours does not have enough money to clean up the mess, and even Chemours is suing Dupont because the company underreported the legal liabilities Chemours would be on the hook for after being spun off into its own company.\n\n\nI'm the one with the jankyass teeth in this article. I was able to crowdfund getting my top teeth taken out and a full upper denture. Still trying to afford the bottom. Give it a read it you have a moment. \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/how-dupont-may-avoid-paying-clean-toxic-forever-chemical-n1138766\n\n\nAlso, here's an episode I collaborated with NJ Spotlight's (PBS) Hazard NJ podcast. You can hear me about 15:30 into the episode. My friends are dying before they hit 40. Like 25% of my graduating class is gone from rare diseases/cancers. I hate it.\nhttps://www.njspotlightnews.org/podcast/hazard-nj-season-2-episode-1-first-a-miracle-then-a-curse/",

Others are afraid Dupont's legal team will come after them for saying anything bad. Others are afraid of having their pensions messed with. Then there's the good ole boys who have been in on the corruption and profited from it for many MANY years, who will straight up make threats to your face for talking about the fuckery. \n\n\nI am not afraid of these people. There's nothing for me to lose. I'm already unable to work full time. I literally can't be in the sun because of my genetic mutation (which neither parent has), which really puts a damper on outdoor activities. Everything I do at this point is to leave that place a better place than I was brought into it. \n\nThe movie Dark Waters is about another Dupont town in WV who got a LOT of media attention for their case. We don't have that kind of publicity, unfortunately. I'm the first one to talk to the media and spread the whole history of this mess. We invented teflon there. Now it's ruining the planet worldwide and is found in RAIN DROPS. *sigh",

Literal de novo genetic mutations in my DNA that neither parent has. Only other recorded cases of this happening with variegate porphyria were a town in Turkey back in the 1960's who got a shipment of fertilizer contaminated with hexachlorobenzene... from Dupont. Checked NJDEP records and they were emitting literal tons of that and dad would have been hauling/burying it. \n\n  \nTheir legal team is so insane though, and I need to pay for a lot of stuff medical-wise to be 100% able to sue the living bejesus out of them and just don't have the money for the testing and doctors I'd need to see for the case to proceed.

Getting folks talking about their experiences growing up around the facility has been absolutely horrifying and depressing. Stories about folks dropping dead and the company sweeping it under the rug to avoid tarnishing their safety record. Stories about the company paying contractors to dispose of toxic waste in unmarked pits that got covered up, only to have houses built on them later... followed by entire streets of people ending up with rare cancers and dying. People were afraid to talk. I had to demonstrate to them that you CAN talk about it and not end up at the bottom of the ocean.",
