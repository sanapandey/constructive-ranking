    "selftext": "Hired to assess a company to increase business performance, I\u2019m a data engineering consultant.\nUsually, I clean data pipelines and set up reports to free time, and allow workers to give better support to each other and think and strategically because they don\u2019t have to spend 20+ hours a week making reports themselves. My favorite part about my job is my clients who tell me they\u2019ve finally been able to go to their kids soccer games, it\u2019s what I work for.\n\nThis time, I\u2019ve come up with 8 solid automation opportunities / time saving process improvement that will allow the company to gain more revenue. The partner stopped by the client today and said that the biggest opportunity for unrealized\nprofit is decreasing commission rates for the salesmen. 50% of the workforce are salesman. Basically, the salesmen that got hired over ten years ago have absurd rate, and make a lot of money, those are the rates to be cut. But at the same time, the company is still profitable (slightly), but not enough to grow much more than it is, but honestly, the people are pretty happy there as is. At the same time, I\u2019d rather have the top 50 salesmen earn the projected $4 million (yes, I did the profit analysis) than just turn it into profit. Of course, I held my tongue and said nothing to my boss. \n\n I\u2019m realizing that my assessment was for nothing, and we were hired here to be the bad guys, to take the fall for new commission policy. Management had it in mind when they hired us",
