Then recently, after asking and asking, I finally got a \"we'll order one.\"\n\nFast forward to today. Got in a staff meeting about how we'll integrate AI into the company. I was told that the use of the AI is confidential. I said that since I'm using my personal computer, I am a security risk. Bossman said he'll follow up on the computer. \n\nHe spoke with the office manager and she got mad at me. Said I threw her under the bus by asking for a new computer when she said she already ordered a new one. Then she just started laying on me her personal grievances with me when all I've ever done was my job. I've never had any personal conversations with her. She said that she clocked my entire personality the moment she met me. I'm like?????????? \n\nAll the higher ups are using me as their personal punching bag. Putting in my two weeks. I am super done. This afternoon it's this. Earlier today it's being told my job can be done by AI. The other week it's being called a bastard for no reason other than my boss being stressed. I'm outtie 5000. I can't find a new job yet. But I can't in good conscience stay here. They can say all they wanna say about me. I never cared about reputation.\n\nFuck.",
