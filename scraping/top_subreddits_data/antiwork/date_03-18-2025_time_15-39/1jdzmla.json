    "selftext": "Until recently, everyone was supposed to learn to code. It was the magic pill that would uncover infinite job opportunities to everyone. Everybody was supposed to become a programmer and leave other fields in droves. Guess what happened\n\nBefore coding, it was general business degree I believe. Everybody was supposed to study business and become a manager or administrator. Guess what happened.\n\nNow, everyone (mostly people who have no connection to trades at all and push their own children to go to college and find a computer job) tells everyone to learn nursing or trades. But people don't understand that there are no infinite vacancies for nursing or plumbing, and these jobs can become oversaturated, too.\n\nCan society already stop with this bullshit? There is no guaranteed and reliable path. The job market is unpredictable and chaotic. And calling people dumb ot lazy for not predicting the job market doesn't move a needle.",

I recently switched from a pretty decent office job to work in a daycare because I felt the work would be more meaningful. I now do \"low status\" work all day long. I change diapers, I wipe noses, I feed children lunch. But there's nothing low status about it? It's not sexy work, sure, but it's very important. Critically important, actually, if COVID-19 had anything to show for it. Other people literally can't do their jobs unless I show up to do mine. Which is why I wanted to move into the field to begin with.\n\nAnd the world runs on these kinds of jobs, and we should have a great deal of respect for these jobs - and the people who work these jobs should have a great deal of pride in what they do. \n\nDevaluing so many jobs keeps wages low it and makes them prime for exploitation. It makes people feel ashamed to take these jobs and contribute in meaningful ways to their society because no one wants to work for pennies, no one wants to be looked down upon. It makes filling these jobs so difficult.\n\nThe world runs on the backs of these types of jobs and we should give them the respect (and pay) that they deserve.",
