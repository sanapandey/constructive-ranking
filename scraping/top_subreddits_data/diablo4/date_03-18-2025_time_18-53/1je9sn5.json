            "body": "If you're playing Eternal the best thing to do activity wise is to farm whispers until April 29. I tested it on the PTR and whisper caches obtained before 2.2 still drop xp orbs. The best to do is farm a ton of those before 2.2 so you can get a pally from 1 to 70 and geared for T1 or T2 in minutes . Save your boss mats as well. If Xpac 2 is anything like Xpac 1 then the pally/templar/crusader will be so OP that they will be able to one shot greater bosses and Uber Belial in T1 gear just like the spiritborn. Blizz has an incentive to make the Pally super OP to drive Xpac 2 sales like before. I guarantee you people who were on the fence about buying Xpac 1 or casuals who weren't very good at the game bought Xpac 1 when they say how OP the spiritborn was. It will be the same with each Xpac",

So why does it even exist? Literally no point, but you know what would make me play it over seasonal? If it had all the previous events integrated into it. That would be cool as it means that all the cool builds that you could ONLY do during their respective seasons will become literally ETERNAL. \n\nI missed so many cool builds from previous seasons that I would LOVE to play today but I can\u2019t because they were using season specific mechanics.",
