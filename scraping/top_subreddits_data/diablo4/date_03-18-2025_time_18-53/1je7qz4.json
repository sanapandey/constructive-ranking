Like, I'm genuinely curious here, totally willing to hear out a reasonable explanation as to why this would be a bad idea. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nOn paper, it creates a genuine choice between general Rares, and much rarer Legendaries, while still making both potentially interesting for different builds. Perhaps the actual level of power in this example is too much? But conceptually, choosing between an item with an extra stat vs losing that stat in exchange for some additional build crafting potential seems like good design. We LITERALLY praise D2 for having a similar system. Or is this a case of \"stats aren't worth much\", so it's a no-brainer pick of Legendary over Rare? (Edit: You would be losing 2 affixes over a Rare here tbf though - This system does sound better with 4 affixes Rares, and a little worse with 3 affixes, the more I think about it.)\n\n>We have uniques and legendary aspects for skill altering shenanigans.\n\nMost Legendaries tend to just be multipliers though - *Some* are interesting build crafting pieces, and I ADORE the design space Legendary affixes creates, but they're almost always taken for their multiplicative power, not their build crafting potential.\n\nI *will* concede this steps on the design space of Uniques a bit here, but... Why is that a bad thing? Unless Blizzard massively overhauls how skills work, we're never going to get any form of creative build crafting within the skill system, so *why not* shift that towards itemisation? The two can pretty comfortably coexist without making either system worse.\n\nPlus, items in D4 *suck*. They're boring stat sticks with an even more boring \"number go up\" GA chase. Giving items some actual meat to them via genuine gear choice would be nice imo.",

(Besides, you're encroaching on the Forbidden Loot Filter Zone.)\n\nWhat we really need is a better color ramp for higher tiers. You're absolutely right that Legendary, Ancestral Legendary, and Unique are a muddle, and it's all you see above a certain level/difficulty threshold. I think we only need one additional color, though. That rose gold color should move from Uniques to Ancestrals, with an in-between god ray. That looks like a \"Legendary Plus\" item. (Also, they need to get rid of the \"(Ancestral)\" suffix on the tag and let the stars do the work.) To replace rose gold on Uniques, add that gorgeous shade of blue you chose for Legendary in your mockup, with the bigger god beam that current Uniques have.\n\nSo the new color ramp would be:\n\n* Normal: White\n* Magic: Dark Blue\n* Rare: Yellow\n* Legendary: Orange, small god ray\n* Ancestral: ~~Orange~~ Rose Gold, medium god ray\n* Unique: ~~Rose Gold~~ Sky Blue, large god ray\n* Mythic: Purple, orbital laser god ray\n* (Sets, reserved because Rod swears we won't get them until we do: Green, smedium god ray)\n\nThe tricky part would be squeezing sky blue into color blindness modes.
