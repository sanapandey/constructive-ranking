    "selftext": "TLDR: NM dungeons are faster and less boring than hordes, so I\u2019ve switched to these for obscudite farming even if the rate per min is better (doesn\u2019t seem to work that way for me).\n\nAnyone else find rate per min better in NM?\n\nMy anecdotal experience:\n\n- Hordes: 10min, 1500-3000 per run, 150/min\n\n- NM dungeon: 3-5min, 800-1200 per run, 233/min\n\nThe benefit of a NM dungeon is how quickly I can clear it while also not being painfully boring.\n\nAt 3-5min, I can do more runs without needing a full gaming session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I could be wrong, though I thought I was getting around 2k a few weeks ago, so it was kinda in the middle compared to s ticrannies.\n\n As of now, I think it's the quickest way to get obducite since it's 4k in a few minutes, which is around the max for NMDs, and usually take more time since you wanna check/double check every nook and crannie.",
