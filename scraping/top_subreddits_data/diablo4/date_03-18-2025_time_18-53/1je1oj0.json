    "selftext": "**Huge damage multipliers, trillions of damage, number bloat, damage disparity among classes**\n\nThe current S8 PTR is a great showcase of how some classes have enormous damage advantage simply because they have access to very efficient (e.g. spend a single single skill point, occupy a single offensive aspect slot, get a Paragon legendary node) and condition-less (e.g. applies to all damage without being conditioned on things like element type and skill tags) damage multipliers that amplify not only their own damage, but in the case of S8, amplify the boss power damage.\n\nSome measures have already been implemented over the past seasons to reign in excessive damage multipliers, such as by placing a cap on multipliers that scale with certain stats. S8 will now have caps on Ultimate skill scaling up to 200%\\[x\\].\n\nHowever, there are still many **examples** of huge multipliers across different sources of damage. (There are likely other examples, this list isn't exhaustive.)\n\n*Key Passives*\n\n1. Rogue, Close Quarters Combat key passive, 25%\\[x\\] of Damage vs Close Bonus converted to condition-less damage multiplier. Easily get **over 200%\\[x\\]** by spending 1 skill point and tempering all offensive gear slots. Offensive tempers are usually merely additive damage that's easily diluted in the single additive damage bucket. S8 PTR made this a beast due to Belial Eye Beams boss power.\n2. Rogue, Precision key passive, 20%\\[x\\] of Critical Strike Damage Bonus converted to more Critical Strike Damage multiplier for Marksman skills. Easily **over 600%\\[x\\]**.\n\n*Aspects*\n\n1. Sorceress, Aspect of Splintering Energy, damage increased by 100%\\[x\\] of Critical Damage Bonus. Easily **over 1000%\\[x\\]** on a single aspect slot.\n2. Druid, Runeworker's Conduit Aspect, Lightning Bolt damage increased by 15%\\[x\\] for every 100 Willpower, converted to Cataclysm damage multiplier using Mjolnic Ryng. Easily **over 800%\\[x\\]** on a single aspect slot.\n\n*Paragon Legendary Nodes*\n\n1. Necromancer, Wither Paragon legendary node, Corrupting effects (shadow DoT) have around 70% chance to deal **over 300%\\[x\\]** damage. S8 PTR made this 1 paragon node a beast due to Belial Eye Beams boss power.\n\n**Why are such huge damage multipliers all over the place?**\n\nI can't remember which season introduced these damage multipliers that scale with stats. I think the concept is fine and can be fun as it adds more nuance to gearing and optimizing stats. However, my issue with the current implementation is that huge multipliers, especially multipliers that scale with stats, are **sprinkled randomly across different places without consistency**. \n\n* Why do some classes only have key passives around 25-50%\\[x\\], but some other classes can go beyond 200%\\[x\\]?\n* Why are most aspects around 15%\\[x\\] to 50%\\[x\\], but there are blatant outliers that can go beyond 1000%\\[x\\]?\n* Why do some classes only have Paragon legendary nodes around 25%\\[x\\] to 40%\\[x\\], but some classes can go beyond 100%\\[x\\]?\n\n**My opinion on how it should be changed**\n\nI personally feel that these huge multipliers need to be toned down and capped, but some players think this limits fun.\n\nAlternatively, if they are to remain \"uncapped\" (technically they are capped because there is a limit of how much scaling stat you can obtain so there is a theoretical cap, but the cap is very high), they should be grouped consistently under the same source across all classes.\n\n**Personally, I think they should all be centralized under Key Passives since Key Passives are build defining**, and the other sources of power such as gear and Paragon Board serve to support your build defining choice. Examples:\n\n* Wanna play a Fire Sorceress? Your Key Passive choice defines your foundation as a mistress of Fire magic and makes your damage scale exceptionally with stats like Damage with Fire and Damage to Burning.\n* Wanna play a Rage Barbarian? Your Key Passive choice defines your foundation as a master of rage and makes your damage scale exceptionally with stats like Maximum Rage.\n* Wanna play a Ranged Rogue? Your Key Passive choice defines your foundation as a master of bow and arrow and makes your damage scale exceptionally with stats like Critical Strike Damage and Damage vs Distant Enemies.\n* Wanna play a Poison Werewolf Druid? Your Key Passive choice defines your foundation as a master of poisons and Werewolf form and makes your damage scale exceptionally with stats like Damage with Poison and Damage while Werewolf.\n\nThe player then customizes the build further with skill tree choices, Paragon Board, gear, aspects, and all of the damage multipliers from these sources (e.g. generic multipliers, or multipliers that apply to specific skills and modify their behavior) should be much lower, like 20-60%\\[x\\] as what we see in typical aspects. This will also help to ensure that within a class, various skills can be balanced by tuning these smaller numbers.\n\nHere's a prime example since I was playing Druid main in S7. Cataclysm was so dominant and overshadowed all other skills. One of the reasons is the newly updated Runeworker's Conduit Aspect in S7 scaled with Willpower and could give over 1000%\\[x\\] on a single aspect. To me it is quite absurd. Such scaling should have gone into the Key Passive section like Perfect Storm so that all Storm builds benefit from the scaling and gives other Storm skills like Tornado and Lightning Storm a chance to shine.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'll conclude by saying that **class balance and skill balance isn't just for the competitive players.** It's only normal that players, competitive and casuals alike, will gravitate towards powerful builds to fulfil their power fantasy. A heavily imbalanced game causes negative user experience:\n\n* A casual player who just wants to have fun trying different skills and builds but gets kicked out of a party or struggles really hard in T4 because he/she isn't playing the meta build/class for the season that's easily 10-100x better than the second-best build.\n* Competitive players who are really very passionate about a particular class but are constantly disappointed season after season by poor class balance due to the existence of absurdly high damage multipliers in one class but not another.\n\nI think the devs need to do a better job if we the gamers/consumers/theorycrafters armed with spreadsheets and training dummies can see these issues from a mile away...",

The whole game is based on slotting legendary affixes that multiply damage for sometimes singular skills and then seeking out multipliers everywhere else to  stack. As long as that's the way the game is designed, they can fuck around with the numbers forever and the core issue of builds centering around boosting a single skill will always remain.\n\nI'm not a POE person. Bounced hard off POE1, but I've played through the available campaign on POE2 with a couple different characters and the way that game handles skill selection and support gems allows for build diversity and customization in a way that Diablo 4s simplistic skill tree does not allow for. I have a ton of problems with POE2 (game's basically a giant slot machine designed to waste your time) but the core gameplay and character building is on another level compared to D4. Putting together different support gems to make some cool feels good. Selecting a skill and 1 of 2 available modifiers does not.\n\nRunes were an opportunity to expand the skill system to allow for some cool crazy combinations but the way they're designed just makes them another avenue for more multipliers or boring passive buffs. How about runes that do something other than invoke a skill from another class or give you 2.5 crit chance? I think Runes are the avenue to making builds and skills in D4 interesting again but I don't know if they'll ever do it.\n\nReign in all the stupid multipliers and then put the power into synergies between skills and runes. How about a rune that...i dunno, makes fireball size +1000% and creates tornadoes that fill the screen, or a rune that summons a killer ice golem when you shatter a frozen enemy or something instead of...2.5 crit chance? These kinds of synergies would make the game more interesting.",

                    "body": "I played PoE1 since it was first released. To be fair, their min-maxing is also about looking for all the possible multipliers like 6-link skill+support gems, gem levels, crit damage bucket, loading up your skill bar with many buffing auras, automating curses etc. However, I don't recall multipliers in the magnitude of 100%\\[x\\] or 1000%\\[x\\].\n\nThe D4 runes system do have interesting options like summoning meteorites, pestilent swarms, vortex to pull monsters etc. But once you have pure numeric damage multipliers among the options (e.g. crit chance, max life that scales overpower damage), the min-maxers will jump on it especially when the subpowers like meteorites/pestilent swarms are numerically underwhelming, or the utility provided is not worth the opportunity cost of losing a 100%\\[x\\] multiplier.\n\nThe game designers really need to sit down and put themselves in the shoes of the player to understand their thinking process behind picking all these options. There are way too many options in this game that are so underwhelming (e.g. majority of unique items) that there's really not many meaningful choices. Most theorycrafters will converge to around 1 or 2 builds per class because everything is else too suboptimal.",

It just swaps out one big multiplier for tons of smaller ones and comes out to the same place. All the gems and the auras and passive skills and extra skill levels are multipliers and they all work out to the same thing as what D4 has.\n\nThis holds up in testing as well. I multiplied 10 by 10 (the equivalent of a 1000% multiplier) and then multiplied that by 1.3 (a 30% multiplier) nine times to get 815; this is analogous to how D4 works, where you do t have that many multipliers to work with but one is massive. For PoE1 I multiplied 10 by 1.3 18 times, double what I did for D4, and came out to 1124. In general, PoE1 lets you stack way more multipliers than D4 does and that works out to being about the same as having one or two really big multipliers and then fewer normal sized ones.",

D4 already has balance problems, imagine if everyone also had Vampire powers, Witch powers, a Seneschal robot companion, and the Barber blight gem thing that consolidates all your damage and makes it explode as an AoE. Even if you limited each power set to only one extra power it would still be an absurd power boost, probably equivalent to adding 3-4 free damage aspects to every build, and Blizzard would have to design new power sets with the knowledge that whatever the best of the new powers was would become baseline for everyone in the future. If you have problems with the balance **now**, I guarantee you they would pale in comparison to the balance problems if everyone got 4 free 30%+ damage aspects and we got one more every season.",

The two highest s7 clears are 123 for ultimate shadow and 118 blight.

Reducing dmg multis from classes themselves will only increase gap between boss and non-boss builds even more. Some of those high class multis are simply needed to enable builds that otherwise don't have access to dmg scaling like the top builds.",

I haven't played World of Warcraft in a long time, but I remember DoTs could crit. Why can't D4 DoTs crit?\n\nIn fact, Barbarians have a key passive Gushing Wounds that make Bleeding damage scale with Crit Chance and Crit Damage. What's the dev's thought process in parking such a large DoT multiplier for Barbarians in the Key Passives, while Necromancers get it in the Paragon Board? This is part of my message, why are such huge multipliers scattered all over the place? There's lack of consistency. Who knows one season Necromancers would get a legendary aspect that scales DoT damage with some random stat up to 1000%\\[x\\] like Sorceress Lightning Spear aspect.",

Some builds should op, not all of them. When we're talking problematic multipliers it's actually the op multipliers that need to be adressed. As long as people can have 30x the dps by making a build op, they'll do everything to do so. And these days you can pretty much make every non-dot skill reliably overpower. \n\nWhy is the necro dot multi a paragon node instead of key passive? Very good question, idk. I've suggested making wither a key passive several times. Because as it stands our dot key passive is entirely useless. It does not increases your dps at all, not even by x1%. That's why necro dot builds just use the general key passive that works for every build bc that at least gives x15% dmg increase.",

Every legendary glyph has a multiplier around equal value, everyone only gets 5 glyphs, so it's mostly about choosing the multipliers that fit your build. Legendary paragon nodes and key passives could probably be redesigned in a similar manner and balanced individually.\n\nMultipliers on gear are much more problematic though, especially since classes have varying amounts of \"room\" for legendary aspects and such. That's where I really feel the conflict between \"this is how I want to play\" and \"this just does more damage\".\n\nOn the other hand, I like how certain multipliers encourage different builds to seek certain types of additive damage (or other affixes) that might otherwise be overlooked. Multipliers like that can be reigned in as necessary by changing the scaling and/or caps.",

                    "body": "Regarding multipliers on gear aspects, my opinion is that all non-skill related damage multipliers should be removed, because they are functionally identical to Paragon Board legendary nodes i.e. multipliers activated under various conditions. In that case, most if not all numeric multipliers would only reside in the Paragon Board and are unlocked as the player gains EXP and Paragon Levels.\n\nAspects should mainly act as skill behavior modifiers and to a lesser extent numeric modifiers. E.g. make Fireball projectiles bounce X times among nearby targets at the cost of lowering damage. Almost like PoE1 support gems. Players have to be smart about mixing and matching the right ones because they have limited offensive, defensive and utility slots.\n\nUnique items should be supercharged versions of skill behavior modifiers and give special stats not found elsewhere that justify the opportunity cost of ditching the regular stats on regular legendary items and tempering stats. The unique items concept is currently good, but the number tuning on unique items is bad...\n\nAll aspects that are required for a build to even function properly should be deleted and merged into the skill tree. Since I played Druid recently, one thing that comes to mind is the aspect for Tornado to seek enemies. This should have been part of the Skill Tree as a baseline, then an upgrade could increase the number of targets seeked by X for players who prefer AoE, and another upgrade could increase damage substantially at the cost of Tornado dissipating after hitting X targets for players who need single target damage. This could help to open up dual Core skill builds that have 1 Core for single target and 1 Core for AoE.\n\nAnd if you think about it, skill behavior modifying aspects actually serve a duplicate purpose as the skill upgrades in the skill tree... What's stopping the game designer from moving aspects to a skill tree skill upgrade? What's the design principle behind parking something in the skill tree (e.g. mutually exclusive upgrades) or in the aspects system (e.g. stackable upgrades)? Should the aspects system be removed, or the skill upgrade in skill tree is redundant and move it to aspects? Lol!",

It gives more a sense of building towards something, which I generally find funner than just \"I hope for a unique drop with good numbers on it.\" Scaling usually also diversifies what I'm doing in the game, since often it means that leveling glyphs and masterworking scales the damage as well (like critical damage scaling).",
