On PlayStation buy it on main and every other account gets the benefit.\n\nJust found this about Game Pass:\n\n\t\u2018At home: Make your primary Xbox (if you have more than one) your home Xbox, which gives anyone who signs in to the console with their profile the ability to use your Game Pass subscription.\u2019\n\nSo I assume if you purchase it\u2019s the same deal.",
