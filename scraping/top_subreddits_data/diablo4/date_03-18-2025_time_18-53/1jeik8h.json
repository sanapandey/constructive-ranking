    "selftext": "My build has me taking Colossal which i know is for the Resolve stack dmg. However, It also increases Damage with Gorilla moves. Since all my Eagle skills are also Gorilla skills and I use Talon which increases Damage with eagle skills, If say I'm spamming Thunderspike, Do both those damage bonuses apply to the skill? and if so, how?\n\n  \nAnd example.. say im getting 50% increased damage to eagle from talon \n\nAnd 50% increased damage to gorilla from colossal\n\nWhat Dmg buff is my Thunderspike getting since its both a Eagle/Gorilla skill atm?",
