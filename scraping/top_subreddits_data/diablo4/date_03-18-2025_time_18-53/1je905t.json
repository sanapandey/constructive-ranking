    "selftext": "First, I appreciate the changes to the bosses and the attempt to increase the difficulty. I would like to talk about this first, so here we go.\n\nI What needs to be clear?\n\nDevelopers, you need to tell us what you want, make it clear what the balance point for builds is. What do you mean? What is the ideal level of The Pit that builds should do? What is the margin for more or less at this level? Knowing this, both you and we will know that changes to nerfs or buffs will be made in later paths in builds.\n\nII Leveling\n\nIt is good as it is now, except for fixing some activities that are giving too much XP, such as the campaign and the Helltides chest.\n\nIII Obols\n\nIt seems that the balance point has been found, please do not change this anymore.\n\nIV The Pit and Torment Tiers\n\nThere is a lot to be said here, but I will summarize it to the PTR.\n\nThe current Pit scaling is out of touch with reality. I know that many people play with the meta, but it is now clear that to progress in glyphs you have to play with only this. If this is passed to the final grades, can we have two Pit scalings here? One from 1 to 100 as it is now in s7 and from 101 to 150 as it is in 2.2.0. Regarding the Torment Tiers, if the above is done, it would leave Torment 4 between tier 80 of Pit.  \nOr in general, you can reduce the scaling a little and redistribute the torments. Please continue to make Torment 4 difficult at the end. Normal attacks from the Pit boss do not cause damage and, depending on the build, they do nothing (nerfing barriers in the future? Seeing immortal characters is ridiculous. But that is for another topic). Increase the damage of these common attacks a little and leave the shadows as they are.\n\nIV Boss Lair\n\nI like how the new bosses and the current bosses are, if you want to make it easier here, please only do this on difficulties I to III, leave difficulty IV as it is or go beyond that, I repeat, the bosses in Torment IV I would leave as they are or go beyond that in the amount of HP at least, Belial doesn\u2019t seem like a pinnacle boss, he has little HP, he\u2019s weak, he doesn\u2019t have phases on his HP bar. Make him a pinnacle. Balance the battle against Andariel lol it seems like she\u2019s the pinnacle boss instead of Belial. Reduce the 20 second time for the altar to respawn and make the smaller Belial appear less. I don\u2019t like how the item drops are, make each boss have its own unique table.\n\nV Item drop rate\n\nI like how it is now, that\u2019s all to say.\n\nVI Bug?\n\nYellow items don\u2019t have three affixes and blue ones don\u2019t have two in leveling.",

            "body": "My main concern with the changes was that leveling glyphs to 100 would be impossible unless carried by a broken meta build and I'm sad to see that is the case.\n\n I was hoping to go spiritborn using the new firestorm unique, But it looks like it won't be viable after t3. I really wish they would overtune the new uniques that come out each season so that they wouldn't just get ignored.",
