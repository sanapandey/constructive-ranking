    "selftext": "I'm aware of the general conception that +damage is an additive stat, as opposed to the damage increase from dexterity for example, but I wanted to test it regardless.\n\nI run an armor quill spiritborn for reference.\n\nTested 2 sets of items, a ring and an amulet. One set had dexterity that increased my skill damage for about 48% (265 to 313% according to the hover UI) and the other a combined + 130% damage. (The ring has a GA and multiple masterworking hits on the damage stat)\n\n(The rest of the stats are irrelevant since they match almost perfectly, or don't effect damage. So the test directly compares dexterity vs + damage)\n\nOne would think increased dexterity would win here, but my testing surprisingly proved the opposite.\n\nI'm seeing significantly higher numbers on testing grounds with the + damage items on, and I'm wondering why this is the case.",

            "body": "I think you misunderstand... damage % is damage regardless. Dexterity gives a certain % bump and it usually takes 8-10 points to equate to a 1%. So in direct comparison, it would take a ton of dexterity to be comparable with 130% Damage affix.\n\nThe reason damage % isn't preferred on gear is simply because of the RELATIVE value versus the alternative on the gear you get it. If you have cumulatively 5000-6000% in additive and conditional stats.... then 130% is a minuscule amount in relative % of what you had before. Like a +0.022% or something. Compare this on your Staff or 2H, where the alternative is 1300-2k Max HP. The HP is a much better value to your setup than a 0.022% damage gain.\n\n  \nIt's not that it does nothing, it's just that the alternative is just a better choice.",

            "body": "No one said additive affixes are useless. Most builds still have additive damage. But you don't use damage% because it's the lowest value. You use like critical damage% because it has a higher value.\n\nBecause you have a MIX of additive damage and multiplicative damage, you get big numbers.\n\nMultiplicative damage has to multiply into something. So, you need lots and lots of additive damage too. The more the better.\n\nBut, multiplicative damage gives more benefit overall. Because you have so much additive damage already from glyphs and such. So, when you add 100% additive damage to 10,000% additive damage that's a very small increase. When you add 10%(x) multiplicative damage, that's a significantly greater increase. Because it's not getting buried under 10,000% additive damage, it's multiplying into that. So, 10%(x) is *like* (the real formula is much more complicated than this) 10,000 x .10 = 1,000% additive damage. Which is 10x more impactful than the ~40% damage%.\n\nBut, if your additive damage was 1,000% then 10%(x) is less impactful and 100%(+) is more impactful.\n\nIf you have enough additive damage otherwise, main stat should come out on top.",

I don't know all the details of your build and I don't intend to do any math right now haha. That's my understanding of how the game works, based on everything I have read. I'm definitely not the definitive source. I hope the information helps you in some way, that's all.",

Their additive bucket if fairly small, and increasing it is extremely effective, as diminishing returns are not holding you back.",

If you have 5k additives (somewhat common for non-op builds while op builds will have 20k+) adding +100% will get you a x2% dmg increase.\n\nThat's why in endgame you always prefer dmg multipliers if there's a choice, eg you always prefer main stat over additive rolls.",
