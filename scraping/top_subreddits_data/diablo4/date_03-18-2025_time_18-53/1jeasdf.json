    "selftext": "Back in the day you heard ***\"FRESH MEAT!\"*** and your heart rate went up. Maybe a little sweat sprang up on your brow. You knew that you were in for a fight, and when you managed to take down the Butcher, you had a sense of satisfaction. Or you got spanked or ran away. No matter the outcome, it was a bit of excitement.\n\nNow, if he even bothers to show up, it's just a nothing burger anymore with the majority of builds.  Often, you don't even hear his full catch phrase, or you just see his cleaver lying on the ground. And it's sad that we don't get what used to be a good battle.\n\nWe really need a way to fix this. The Butcher needs to go on a workout plan to make him a threat to you, no matter what your build. How to do this? I really don't know, but I miss that \"oh, crap!\" moment when he would pop out. Same with the Son of Malphas. In Season 3, he was a challenge too. \n\nAnd if they can fix this for The Butcher, I think we need more encounters in more places, and we need other such monsters. Bring the Son of Malphas back and introduce new ones. Let them pop up anywhere in any content except The Pit or Hordes.  Cruising through the open world, there should be a chance for an ambush. Not just in dungeons. A good jump scare is a good thing for us all.",

Not so cool in hardcore. But like the bloodseekers in season 2, the idea of an ememy stalking you and showing up unannounced was fun.\u00a0\n\n\nThe hellborne do not give that same feeling, because it's a long build up and entirely predictable. They're also not rewarding anymore.\n\n\nWith Belial appearing randomly after a ladder boss fight, and malignant enemies spawning randomly after raid bosses and other fights, it would be great if the butcher could show up more than once a season.",
