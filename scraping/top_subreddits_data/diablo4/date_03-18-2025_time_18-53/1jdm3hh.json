They're supposed to be icing on the cake of getting the right affixes to begin with.\n\nThis is a seasonal game, multi-GA gear must not be mandatory. They are just a little extra.\n\nIf they become so much more powerful then they become mandatory and need to become common so that people with 25-50 hours per season can get fully kitted out.\n\nWe don't want multiple GAs to make the item so much more strong it becomes necessary to have multi GAs.",
