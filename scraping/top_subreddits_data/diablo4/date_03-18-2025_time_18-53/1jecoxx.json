    "selftext": "Hi. I bought D4 + VoH bundle and wanted to upgrade dlc. But when I added the upgrade to my cart on Steam, there was a message (roughly translated) - \"If you'll purchase this [upgrade Standard VoH to Ultimate], you won't get another copy of VoH\". Okay, but why? I already bought the bundle with Dlc, so why it shows me this message?",

You are just upgrading the copy you already have. Somebody might try to do what you are doing thinking they would get a completely new separate DLC that could sell or give away to a friend. So it's warning you that's not the case, and you are just improving the one copy you already have. \n\nThat's my guess anyway",

I do have both D4 and the dlc, and I noticed some people were confused about purchasing the game, so maybe this means it's just an upgrade and not a game. \n\nEdit:: I translated this message from my cart after adding the upgrade:\n\n\"If you'll purchase this for yourself, you won't get another copy: Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred\"\n\nThis product contains one time use content, which cannot be refunded\"",

                            "body": "On steam, it's usually they discount the purchase of what you already own. For example, if I buy a DLC bundle that contains 4 items (each is $1.99). If I own say one of them, it would show full cost minus $1.99 discount of what I already owned. Steam always says you won't get another copy because they are not charging you for it. Therefore, you shouldn't expect a free copy if that makes sense.",

Which wasn't something I wanted anyway.\n\nEdit:: now it says this:\n\n\nWarning: You own these elements in \"Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred - Standard to Ultimate Edition Upgrade\". After finalizng purchase you won't get additional copies of these elements: Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred\"\n\nI only bought the bundle, no upgrades",
