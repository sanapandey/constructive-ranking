All I have left for the seasonal journal is to either get 750 in the infernal horde which feels fucking impossible on my blood wave necro just because of the mechanics and the reliance on perfect RNG, 10 chests in a helltide, or kill 250 monsters before the Hellborne guy shows up.\n\nThe only one that seems attainable right now for me is the 10 chests in a single helltide but I'm hoping they start that buff so the grind isn't as mind-numbingly boring.\n\nI basically had a perfect setup for the 250 monsters one with the hellspire but it simply doesn't spawn monsters fast enough or I can't group and kill them fast enough with blood wave. Maxed out at 185 or something. In the infernal horde I had great RNG with Hellborne but could still only get like 650 because I just can't get around the map fast enough and spawn events fast enough.\n\nI know I'm a sucker but I want that fucking bird....",

Just kill everything in sight, click everything that gives cinders in between, maybe a spyre or two. You'll have it done in no time. For the 250, spyre.
