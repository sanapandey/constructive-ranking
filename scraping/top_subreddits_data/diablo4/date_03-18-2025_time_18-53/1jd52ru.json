Used to play d2 and did again recently when d2r came out, but now I'm back in it. I just made my first sorc recently and I'm very interested in the lightning spear build. However, I've yet to make a seasonal character and it seems like lightning spear right now is pretty dependent on Grow. Is it still worth it for me to make this in eternal? I dont need the very best, just to play the game on T4 and ideally get up to pit 100 if possible. Appreciate any response!",
