    "selftext": "Heads up, legends!  \n  \nWe recently identified two issues that we wanted to give you an update on.  \n  \n1) On March 11 there was a brief period of time where the Spark Bonus Meter wasn't updating. This has since been fixed, and all players who completed the bonus meter or lost progress on their bonus meter have been granted one Beast of Prey Pack.  \n  \n2) Additionally, there is an issue where it looks like Beast of Prey Packs do not count towards unlocking Loba's Heirlooms. This is a visual-only bug, and these packs do count towards unlocking her Heirloom.",
