But other times, it feels like it's my first day holding a mouse and keyboard. My hands start shaking every time I engage an enemy, and I struggle to even down one player in a game session.",

This is the same for competitive games, some days you will feel energic, focused and some days you will feel as if you've never played before. If you feel like you aren't performing well, then you probably should take a break and play some other games. You can't play at your best everyday. And that's human.",

I play Apex Legend, COD and more and while I\u2019m pretty good and tend to hit my shots and kills rather well I run into players that are just so consistent. I\u2019ve played matches with them repeatedly with mic communication and started to understand on a higher level why\u2026 Practice makes perfect but they also just aim to purely kill and have the upper hand on all other players with 9+ kills per game no matter their teammates. They have played to the point where they know when to tell if the opposition is going to back out if you keep firing on point or where to get a better position. You have to develop more mindfulness and just accept that you\u2019re going to die sometimes but have the pure concentration that you will win the battle and when to reposition. You\u2019re main impression is that you are giving the presence to the opposing that you are the \u2018predator\u2019 to them like how you feel when you are shaking. Confidence, mindset and practice. Teammates are also quite important so don\u2019t blame them because you never know where they are on their journey in the game. A lot of games provide practice areas so getting used to the guns you use and the damage to the opponents which are present will help you gain the upper hand as you develop the knowledge in how the game and opponents you face work.",
