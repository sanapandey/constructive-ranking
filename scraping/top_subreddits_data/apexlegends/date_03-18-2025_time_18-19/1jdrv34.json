    "selftext": "The random character aspect provides a good fix for a quality game mode. \n\nBefore it was common for people would quit at the start if the team didn't have a LL or NewCastle in the team. The random character removes that, along with choosing characters, which creates diversity. \n\nAlso you get both upgrades. Love that. \n\nI believe they also changed it to 3 strikes THEN you're out. Which I think is good. Extra ammo on drop. They provide weapons to replace red weapons on respawn. Very nice. \n\nThe problems? The ring I think is a bit too spicy. Does too much damage. You spend so much time in action then it's like oh the ring is coming. \n\nDoes seem like Shelia is OP. Seer obviously is need of assistance. \n\nAn idea would be to add a \"revenge\" noise since it's common a defeated team land in the same place for a rematch. \n\n",

I've never had teammates leave because of no support, as the regular revive is so fast you can survive for a while with just that, so I guess I'm kinda biased, but I do like that you can get 2 of the same character sometimes; spices it up a lil",
