    "selftext": "So I've struggled logging into apex all day today on ps5. My internet right now is actually stable. My ping averages around 190 to 250. Which I can handle. This time, however, despite that being the ping, I still can't log in. When I do load into the lobby, I load in, but I'm not directly in the lobby, it doesn't show my character icon by party members. So I can't join anyone, can't ready up. I can still roam the lobby. Skins, apex crates, ect. I just can't ready up or actually play. I've tried resetting internet, restart game, restart ps5. Everything. Right now as I type this. I've loaded into the lobby, but I can't play or ready up. ",
