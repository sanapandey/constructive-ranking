Which honestly I loved because it meant I never had to fight for my legend with randoms. I\u2019m definitely a pick one legend and master them type of person. Any time I end up on another legend my first instinct when I see someone is shoot my smart bullet. Depending on the legends Tatical that doesn\u2019t always go over well\ud83e\udd23",
