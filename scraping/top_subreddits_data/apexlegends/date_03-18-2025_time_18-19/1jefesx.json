    "selftext": "just the messenger here. i wanted to calculate the value of the chained offers. of course, it's up to you to decide what's valuable or not.\n\nif you have 0 apex coins and would like the entirety of the 123 packs, you have to spend $70 USD to get the  6700 coins + 1000 coins. you also get the Redemption Havoc skin, a couple legendary skins, and some battle stars.\n\njust wanted to share this so people don't have to do the calculations themselves!",
