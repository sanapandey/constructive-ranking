Lots of questions here, and I\u2019ll try to answer them as best as I can with as much context as I can. Okay here we go.\n\nYou\u2019re keeping a great pulse in the competitive scene and called it out rightly so \u2013 the competitive experience is a whole different world from the casual or ranked experience in Apex. Comp players will find what works best for them, what is the strongest weapon or legend meta for what they need to accomplish to meet their gameplay goals, and they will excel at those few niche picks, this is true regardless of the current weapon meta.\n\n**[...]**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1j3lnup/ama_lets_talk_about_takeovers_legends_and_weapons/mg8fegd/?context=3\n\nWe always consider all of our players when making sweeping changes such as this.

It just happened to coincide with moving away from the support meta and thus the long team fights with multiple resets.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1j3lnup/ama_lets_talk_about_takeovers_legends_and_weapons/mg8a5ou/?context=3\n\nCurrently no.

The more likely thing is that we see adjustments to those Legends more directly as we wind down on the class identity season themes and take on new directions for the feel of upcoming seasons.

But it's coming soon, hold tight!\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1j3lnup/ama_lets_talk_about_takeovers_legends_and_weapons/mg8gmvg/?context=3\n\nCheers!

And yeah, loved all the \"shut you up\" lines he used to have. As for the Assault scan - we'll have to see where that ends up once the season simmers down. It's actually an aspect of the Battle Surge perk that might be doing more work than it needs. We'll see!\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1j3lnup/ama_lets_talk_about_takeovers_legends_and_weapons/mga75sf/?context=3\n\nNo, sorry. Just outside my realm of knowledge. This AMA was focused on weapons & Legends and we don't have much to do with prestige skins, heirlooms, collection events or dive trails. Whole different set of folk look at that part of the game, didn't have the right people on hand to answer those questions today and it wasn't the focus of the ama. The feedback itself we can pass along though, just don't have the answers for you.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1j3lnup/ama_lets_talk_about_takeovers_legends_and_weapons/mga7evi/?context=3\n\nYeah, and LTM's always possible - we had wall-running in the Shadowfall events a while back as part of the Hallloween event.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1j3lnup/ama_lets_talk_about_takeovers_legends_and_weapons/mga7q9a/?context=3\n\nA Titanfall LTM does sound pretty sick!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1j3lnup/ama_lets_talk_about_takeovers_legends_and_weapons/mga82z5/?context=3\n\nhaha - You're all good. Never took it as rude :) Easy to see how it would be anyone's guess as to when a new Legend might come along nowadays vs the every-season cadence we used to have. Glad to shed some light on where we're coming from.

So we opted to ensure all characters followed the new ruleset.\n\nAdditionally, in this version, shooting someone with red armor, and seeing those red effects speaks to a prize you can earn and obtain. If that player was red, but they're also a Controller Legend - do they just have the perk? Or are they carrying something you can take?\n\n\n\nHowever, we're well into the season now, know how the Red Helmets play out across the field - so that may become an opportunity for Controller Legends in the future, and something we've been discussing.\n\nController Legends are not marked for a meta-shakeup season. They had the unfortunate luck of being the first class alongside recon that we launched in this initiative - and learned from that season that we needed to go harder to make a real impact. It's more likley we'll start to have a look at the Legends within those classes who have fallen by the wayside once the sun has set on these class-focused seasons.\n\n\n\n\\- and thank you for being so passionate about this game.\n\nThe Shiela tracker thing has come up before!

While I typically give a fair shot to every mode, I engaged with this particular mode for only one round and yet I'm confident I soaked it all in when the guy who happened to land on a double tap eva8 melted me two seconds into the match from above me while jumping from a staircase, no opportunity for counterplay. Nice try, queue again! (No thanks, I'm good.) I'm generally willing to take a chance on new modes. This one is just a stinker.",

I would love to see this attachment be reserved for under-utilized weapons to help balance what the player wants to prioritize (evo/ult gains vs. comfort weapons).\n\nI have seen a lot more CAR usage, which I think is great considering how overshadowed it had been.\n\n2.

In short, we found that despite this delicious cookie of extra ultimate and EVO gains, the Accelerated weapons still were not being used. As this was the first time we have added a hop-up coming by default onto a weapon, we wanted it to be strong, and be utilized, and to do so, we decided to put them on already well-performing weapons. The CAR was our true middle of the pack weapon at the time of developing the Accelerated weapons, so we also wanted to give it some love as well.\n\nRegarding Accelerated weapons working when stowed, we also had originally playtested a version where you needed to be holding the weapon in your hands in order to get the benefit of the system. The feedback around this was that it was frustrating when getting the knock or kill on someone and then realizing \u201cOh no! I forgot to swap to my G7 to get the final kill\u2026 Now I don\u2019t get the extra ultimate charge,\u201d And you would be surprised how often this occurred. After a great fight, you don\u2019t want to be kicking yourself in the foot for not doing a potentially un-optimal weapon swap just to get those extra gains, you want to feel proud, confident, and get prepared for the next one.",

Just 30 percents of your ult charge does not worth the huge risks of losing your games, since you will be easily defeated by those Nemesis Lstars eva8s and p2020s. Your evo or ult means nothing if you are dead. If the designers really plan to add the hopup to weak weapons like alternator 3030 re45 or wingman, then it would be better if the number was raised higher like 60 percents, which would almost recharge your ult in no time.

Is this done to allow players of lower skill to occasionally get kills on players better than them so the retention time can stay up?",

A specific oddball question: Arsenals, is it intentional that they will \"eat\" an attachment in your inventory if available and not provide a new attachment? (Example: you have a Purple Light Mag in your inventory and a R-99 with no attachments. You activate the Light Ammo Arsenal. The Arsenal will take the Purple Light Mag from your inventory and attach it to your R-99 and will give you a 1x sight upon completion of the upgrade without providing any new Laser Sight, Mag, or Stock.) I could see this as simply helping a newer player fix the situation or as an accidental glitch.  \n\nOverall, I love the Arsenal change and look forward to seeing how the Legends are revamped further in future. Off-topic, I would love more discussions on if tracking statistics of Mix-Tapes and other modes will be available in the future so that I can assess if I am improving over time.",

                    "body": "To answer your question directly: they were all made at once as the culmination of a couple design teams (namely weapons and Legends) working to shake-up the \"survival-heavy\" meta with the tools at their disposal. For weapons, that was widespread buffs and some loot massaging (inspired partly by how punchy weapon identities felt in Launch Royale and \"loot creep\" over the course of five years). For Legends, it was a new Class focus that excelled at intiating and closing out fights, with a goal to elevate a couple Legends that were always middle-to-bottom of the pack in terms of popularity and power fantasy. In early playtests, it just felt good to convert damage into kills more consistently... we knew there was something there worth pursuing.\n\nTo answer that second part: It's easier to find that middle ground by taking big (measured) swings and reacting. It also creates a more dynamic live experience season over season, and resets the skill floor in some ways, allowing players to rediscover and relearn elements of Apex that may not have been at the forefront before. \"Perfect balance\" is (1) unobtainable and (2) boring, even in a sweaty, competitive game like Apex. We just need to be diligent about keeping the sharp edges in check with things like frequent targeted hotfixes.\n\nAs a live game, we want things to feel fresh yet familiar. We're proactively planning season over season while also reacting to the live climate. We get more feedback in one hour of a seasonal update going live than we do in the months of playtesting leading up to it, and we'd be doing everyone a disservice if we didn't leverage that to better balance the game. It's easier to tune hot and dial back than it is to ship something that's compelling on paper but not sticky/powerful enough to get players off what's familiar to them. If they don't find success with the new thing early, they will stick to what I know and go back to gaining RP. Ballistic is an example of this: if [players are calling a Legend balanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/13foyhr/is_ballistic_the_most_balanced_legend_on_release/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on release, we know we didn't push hard enough. Now he's got some wild upgrades, his whole team gets a huge speed boost when he ults, and he can access unlimited ammo crate weapons. And now that people are playing him, we're better equipped to identify what is and is not working for him specifically and adjust accordingly. Same goes with other elements of the TTK design shift.",

Or that you start with a white helmet and have to level it up through a replicator. \n\nHow many replicators do you typically pass in a game? Three? Making one choose between that extra battery, Med kit, or a permanent defense boost seems like meaningful gameplay to me. And if you're lucky enough to have all the loot that you need, having the extra option of boosting your helmet make sure that replicators don't go to waste. I know personally, after a good looting path, I don't need a replicator after the first one unless I'm getting crafting banners.",

It feels like they have been left in the dust and the only thing they do is scan care packages.\n\n  \n2. Are any of the older Prestige skins getting their respective dive trails? I own the Wraith prestige skin and it sucks not having any trails for her unless I buy another legends prestige skin and use that one.\n\n  \n3. Are we going to see any original heirlooms? Universal heirlooms don't feel/look as good as Legend-tied heirlooms and look super bland.  \n  \n  \n4. Are CE just gone? Milestones are super anti-consumer friendly and whenever I see one get announced I just roll my eyes and sigh, I would love to be able to spend my coins or crating materials on things I want instead of having to kind of slot-machine my coins/materials on things I want.\n\n\n\n5. Is there any chance Pathfinders grapple gets reverted back to distance based CD? Having a 30 second CD on a legend that's supposed to be mobile really hurt him and playing him is almost a detriment to the team.",

However, many players feel that fights were drawn out not because TTK was too high, but because reviving and resetting were too fast and too forgiving\u2014especially with support class perks like 4-second revives and fast HP regen after revive.\n\nInstead of adjusting those mechanics, the solution chosen was to reduce TTK, which has now made fights end much faster but has also created new issues, such as making slow-paced legends like Controllers feel even less viable, and healing feels way too slow. The faster downed speed as compensation has been questioned by the community as well.\n\nSo the question is: Was reducing TTK really meant as a solution to the revive/reset problem? Or was it an entirely separate decision? And if so, why do you choose changing ttk as a solution which itself could potentially cause more chained-problems? Isn\u2019t dial back revive perk (e.g: only regen 75 hp after revive) a more direct approach?",

His utility comes mainly from his ability to influence the natural gun-skill output of a fight - so in the right hands he can be pretty powerful.

Would like to tackle all of these, will just be a matter of time a priority as to which ones go first.\n\n\n\nMore Legend releases? Yes. New Legends are coming.\n\nAs our design director has stated, they just haven't had as much impact on the game with the much larger roster - so our cadence of release has slowed to focus more on changing the core experience. Changes that impact more than just one Legend at time and can be felt by a large number of players in Apex to make the game feel like it's fresh and evolving - but that doesn't mean we don't want to add a new piece to the chess board now and again.

Wall hacks, passive gold magazines or passive gold shields have been beyond frustrating to fight against this last half year as those specific character's stats skyrocket with little effort. It really sounds like you guys \"Switched up the meta\" like you \"hinted at\" after lifeline's third or fourth rework while the same lowest pick rate legends remain as exactly that.\n\nThere will always be a meta; new metas are fine, as long as there are multiple viable counters. The current power gap between Legends doesn't have to be this intense it's like all attempts to balance things have gone out the window and unless you're playing those 11 viable characters the game is, truly, not fun. I hope they update every single class to the point they've left Support and Assault at. If not then I hope they at least take the time to fix Wattson's bugged fences and stop ruining a character that they don't plan to adjust for game balance.",

It\u2019s an exciting shakeup moving into what the next year of Apex Legends has to offer!\n\nRotating Accelerated Weapons? Short answer: Yes! Slightly longer answer: just like how our hop-up system ebbs and flows with the current weapon meta, as will the Accelerated weapon rotation. Expect to see the Accelerator hop-up move over to some new guns in the near future!\n\nWith the addition of Arsenals into the game, it felt like there were too many vectors to guarantee your ammo supply in the game, and in order to highlight all of the gameplay Arsenals has to offer in its debut season, replicators took a small hit on their ammo economy.\n\nI would say that the most popular optics really depend on what the weapon meta is shaking out to be. Marksman meta? 3x and 2-4x. Shotgun meta? 1x or no optic at all. You get the picture. Above all that though, the 1x holo still sat at the bottom of charts for sometime, despite the current weapon meta. For most players, it was the \u201cI\u2019ll use this until I find something better,\u201d and to clean up the loot pool, the decision was made to remove it.",

I've noticed that with the reduction of the TTK, there have been a hell of a lot more third parties. This also happens starting from diamond rank, which shouldn't happen because the entry cost into ranked is usually high there and the point of battle royale is to survive, not to play like deathmatch on a big map. And it constantly lowers your rank because third parties always abuse it when players have low HP. The situation is made worse by the fact that even bronze players can easily get diamond and they don't have enough experience/skill in countering with third parties. Do you have any plans to fix this? Will there be a new (or reworked) legend that can do something like an impassable wall to keep third parties out?",

The Support changes and prevalence of red armor were a very deliberate attempt to increase survivability and boost multiple Legends with abilities that help you reset, or simply have a moment to process what to do for your next move. But that also made fights more drawn out, increasing the risk for third-parties. But maybe because fights conclude sooner now, players have more time outside of combat and are more frequently looking to third-party? Looking at some dashboards, there doesn't appear to be any notable shift in \"dead time\" between this season and last, but lobbies are expectedly dying slightly faster than last season. Why do you think there have been more third-parties? Shouldn't there be less, if fights are concluding faster? Could it be the map rotation? These are some of the questions we ask ourselves when trying to understand player experience and motivation.\n\nAs someone climbing through Diamond ranks right now, I would challenge the assumption that there have been \"a lot more third parties.\" I sense a slight uptick, possibly because players feel more empowered to seek fights with an aggressive Legend meta and higher success rate converting damage into kills. This is compounded by the map rotation. But I also think the distinct lack of survival focused Legends makes us feel more powerless when things turn south, compared to last season. When the third-party came last season, you dropped Gibby bubble/Newcastle walls/Lifeline halo (or your Loba solo-queue third has already teleported to the crafter two POIs over). Reset potential gave good players more agency to *react*, whereas now there's more of an emphasis on rewarding preparation and strong positioning *before* a fight starts unfolding. I think \"managing the third party\" is a necessary skill to master in higher Ranks, and I think players at all skill bands are adjusting to the radical shift in \"combat feel\" between this season and last.\n\nPersonally, I think Ranked is not punishing enough for poor placement. As long as that's the case, regardless of meta, you will have players that are motivated by KP more than strategizing for end game. Unfortunately this isn't a Ranked AMA and I'm not a Ranked designer, but I do provide my input from a dev and Ranked player perspective. It's all I play, and I hear your concerns about ladder progression.\n\nOn your last point, on the impassable wall ability. I've thought about that exact same thing but I think the devil is in the details... how big is it... Seer ult size? A whole POI? Wouldn't that attract more players to the area? Can other players see it? Is audio muted inside of it? Can enemies leave it? Is it an ult? What other \"stuff\" should it do to feel ult-like? Make your pitch!",

His damage just wasn\u2019t very helpful before but now that players are swinging fights they are taking ample damage in some encounters. Shamefully his ultimate regardless of its upgrade is seemingly no more useful than his traps. It would be amazing to see his Nox Vision Passive be more useful and normal. I would love to maybe see gas damage nerfed for either the original stun coming back, or possibly a some kind of rework to his gas grenade. And if rampart has near instant wall speed we could really use a trap animation increase. Thank you guys for all of the opportunity to communicate as a community again. We love apex.

I feel many players share the sentiment that he needs at least some positive adjustments. Maybe bring back gas blur?\n2. Could we slightly Buff Revenant's ultimate? I completely understand why you took away the extra 25 health and instant health regen; those had little counter and were annoying to go against. However, I feel Revenant's ultimate may have gone too far into the negative. So, what if we buffed the less annoying parts of his ultimate? For example, you could give back his tac cooldown reduction while in ult, increase the time you're in the ult, or even just reduce the recharge time for it.\n\nThanks for reading!

Compared to his current perk, which grants access to all legend class items, **\"More Me\"** seemed far more fitting for his playstyle and didn\u2019t blur the lines between class identities.\n\nWith Mirage struggling to find a solid place in the meta, has there been any consideration of bringing **\"More Me\"** back or implementing a similar change to refine his niche? I\u2019d love to see Mirage get more meaningful utility that plays into his strengths rather than broadening his role in ways that don\u2019t fully suit him.\n\nAppreciate all the hard work you put into the game!",

See Legends under-performing like Wattson, Caustic, Crypto and Seer - it's likely they'll receive some love soon after the class wars have ended.\n\n\n\nI know Larson is itching to make some Caustic changes, and Wattson's another Legend we've been looking at to try and make have value to a wider selection of players.\n\nWill have to wait and see what the future holds for both of those Legends - especially once the dust settles on the class updates.",

For many of us, Pubs is a place to enjoy the core game of Apex without sweating it out in Ranked. When LTMs that massively change the core balance of the game takeover Pubs, you're taking away that casual option. \n\nAnd with the recent TTK changes, having max juiced up weapons makes the game feel like CoD. \n\n(Side note, wish you made Redemption the takeover instead, as it genuinely provided a vanilla+ experience that addressed the core issues of Pubs, ie lobbies dying out too quickly).\n\n---\n\n2- Ash's new dash is so incredibly fun, and its the main reason I decided to come back to the game after a 2 season hiatus. What's your opinion on extending that movement philosophy to other legends? Can we please see wallrunning come back to the Titanfall universe, perhaps as a class passive?",

The players obviously want it!\n\nOur job as designers is to separate what players want from what players need. Apex is a game with deep mastery, discovery, and interplay between Legends. Movement mechanics and map, loot, weapon, and Legend design are all interconnected... you can't touch one without affecting the other. What would happen if we gave Ash dash to everyone? It would feel fresh and fun for a week, but then some issues would bubble up. Caustic's whole kit isn't designed around that level of movement. He doesn't need to dash to conduct experiments on his enemies, and he doesn't want other people dashing because he's all about area denial and crowd control. Controller legends on whole would take a hit. Same with Recon. Grenades are less meaningful now because enemies can just dash away. Map design becomes less interesting... everything feels more samey when you can dash to the nearest piece of cover. SMGs take a hit because it's way harder to track enemies moving at fast speeds up close. Long range combat takes a hit.\n\nBasically, the game's not built for it. It's also why as a Titanfall fan, I'm still a wall-run hater in Apex. It would let you down more than it helps you.\n\nThat's not to say we shouldn't explore or dismiss what players want or ask for. Maybe there's a version of wall-running that's more traversal focused than as a combat tool, and level designers can plan for it accordingly. And we can rebalance and rework Legends as the game evolves. I just hope to shed some light on the level of thought and care that has to be put into core gameplay changes. There is a cascading effect that we must be cognizant of as stewards of the game.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll still be playing Ash (cuz she's fun) and eagerly await changes to a couple of my mains that have fallen by the wayside. Apex has evolved, and they must too in order to stay relevant.",

Give a version of movement to characters when it makes sense to do, maybe like the Skirmisher class, and like you did for Ash and Lifeline. \n\nLots and lots of players on the higher end use movement tech. And it's fun. It feels great to pull off a wall bounce, tap strafe etc.\n\nBut its not as easily accessible to all players, or console players. Let your more casual players experience that feeling with a smaller barrier to entry. A wallrun, dash, double jump, is that kind of accessible fun movement. \n\nIf we're talking technically, there's a pretty good spread of linear straight surfaces that can be used for a short 1/2 second wallrun.\n\nIt really doesn't need to be as strong as in Titanfall. Just like we now use wallbounce, and a hacky way to short wall run, a legit wallrun on a short decay would add so much to movement.",

Now, while his wall shares similar properties - it's directionality has always remained a core part of its weakness and counterplay, and has been a core differentiator.\n\nThat being said, we do believe that Newcastle is a little overtuned - and there is room for him to come down. We'll likely evaluate that more closely after the Assault and Skirmisher seasons have made their mark and the dust settles, since these new TTK changes coupled with the new Ash and Assault perks have driven him down the ranks significantly again already.",

This issue seems to only be affecting OCE console players specifically and there are multiple reports of this issue from many console players in OCE. Will this issue be fixed and sydney server players can go back to 120hz on our own servers? Issue has been going on since middle of last season. PLEASE HELP!",

Now, just a few weeks into the new season, we\u2019ve shifted into an even narrower weapon meta, dominated by L-Star, Rampage, and now P2020, while many other weapons remain largely unused.\n\nThis suggests that buffing all weapons didn\u2019t actually solve the viability issue\u2014it just temporarily created the illusion of variety while players were still experimenting. But as always, players naturally gravitate toward the most efficient solutions, and we\u2019re already seeing the meta tighten again. Given this predictable pattern, why shift away from structured balancing in favor of broad, across-the-board buffs? Unless weapons are differentiated enough to provide distinct value, only a few will remain viable in the meta. Accelerator seems like one step toward that\u2014are you considering more solutions, such as additional hop-ups, to create true variety beyond just raw damage increases?\n\nBecause right now, from a competitive standpoint, even though I love the R-301, especially with my Mythic skin, the reality is that Nemesis kills faster, is easier to use, and even recharges my ability. So why would I ever pick up the R-301? Even if it got a +1 damage buff, so did Nemesis, and that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Nemesis is simply the better option. Doesn\u2019t this show that increasing damage across the board doesn\u2019t truly solve weapon viability? At the end of the day, the R-301 doesn\u2019t offer distinct value compared to other ARs, not even situational value. Yes, it\u2019s easy to control, but most experienced players in the game don\u2019t struggle with recoil control in general.",

                    "body": "Oh boy! Lots of questions here, and I\u2019ll try to answer them as best as I can with as much context as I can. Okay here we go.\n\nYou\u2019re keeping a great pulse in the competitive scene and called it out rightly so \u2013 the competitive experience is a whole different world from the casual or ranked experience in Apex. Comp players will find what works best for them, what is the strongest weapon or legend meta for what they need to accomplish to meet their gameplay goals, and they will excel at those few niche picks, this is true regardless of the current weapon meta.\n\nThe TTK changes were designed for everyone who plays Apex, from new players to comp players, so let\u2019s talk about it more broadly.\n\nWhy did we buff everything? Well. Short Answer: Buffing is more interesting than nerfs. There are a lot of great psychological reasons why this is true and I definitely suggest reading up on some of them, loss aversion being the main one that comes to mind. The changes to TTK were not only to address viability with weapons, it only made up a part of reasoning behind the change, so viability of all weapons is not the only metric we are looking at when considering this new TTK a success. \n\nWhen we were deciding how to buff each and every weapon, we looked at their current pick-up rates, win-rate, damage per pickup, etc and made the call to buff our top performers slightly but push heavily on our middle of the pack and lower performers. In doing so, we successfully moved some weapons that were sitting at the top of the leaderboards for literal years out of those top spots.\n\nWhile right now, it may feel like only some weapons are viable, I would consider the new TTK like a brand new game - the first few weeks, maybe month, it's gonna feel like only one or two things are good, but as players learn, adapt, evolve, we all come together and realize that, actually, there are a lot of viable options, it just takes time. I completely admit, at first blush, we buffed a few weapons a little too hard \\*cough\\* L-Star \\*cough\\* but we are working with the community to do right by that and bring weapons back in line with our goals. Now that the new TTK is out in the wild, we will continue to look for more solutions to push our weapon balance to where we want it to be.\n\nLet\u2019s talk R-301 for a quick second because you brought it up. The 301 is our jack of all trades in Apex Legends. It\u2019s good. Not bad. Not great. Just good. It\u2019s truly a balanced weapon. Now imagine if every weapon in the game was also a perfectly balanced weapon\u2026 then do we really have multiple weapons? If everything is perfectly balanced, is it really that fun or interesting? So, why do you pick up the 301? Because everyone loves vanilla ice cream. It's approachable, easy to use, good in many players hands, regardless of skill level. Sometimes you need old reliable to get you through the day.",

Really glad to hear your perspective :)\n\nHere is a follow up: With the introduction of Accelerator, you\u2019ve given some weapons an added value outside of just raw damage.

Or maybe things like silencers, or other attachments that change how a weapon functions beyond damage output level? :)",

            "body": "I have suggestions:\n\nGeneral Suggestions:  \n1 - The biggest headache in Apex Legends is getting into a third party. To prevent this, my suggestion is that Gibby's Dome should be a survival item like Heat Shield or Evac Tower. Or Heat Shield can also have a damage-proof feature like Gibby Bubble. Instead of dome, create another ability for Gibby and make Gibby's Dome a survival item. This will both keep the game fresh and be a preventive element for third parties.\n\n2 - Before entering the game, Legends should have a survival item in their pockets. Let's choose which one to have in the game lobby or in the Legend Locker menu.\n\n3 - Choosing perks while in the game can be really annoying. Either there should be a perk selection menu for each Legend in the Legends Locker menu and let's choose the perks there. It should be clear which perks will be chosen before entering the game. Or the perk selection should be removed completely and all perks should be accessible.\n\n  \nCrypto Gameplay Suggestions:  \n1 - Make Crypto more aggressive legend. I claim that Crypto is the Legend who uses his ult the least when it is charged. Because sometimes we can't use it. I press and hold to switch to Drone's view to use my ult, but before I can switch to drone's view, enemies see it before me and destroy it. Or when I want to switch to drone view to cast my ult, I take a small damage (for example with Ash's Arc Snare). I am kicked from drone's view. And the drone is destroyed and my ult is wasted. Apart from Crypto and Valkyrie, there is no other Legend whose ult is wasted because they take damage. This is not fair.\n\n2 - The nerf for Crypto's perk Off the Grid makes the perk completely useless. Because even if I switch to drone view in a place far from the enemy, when I launch the Drone, I reveal my location to the enemy due to its sound. To prevent this, you can make the Drone invisible and silent for the first 3 seconds while it is launched. This can also solve part of the problem I mentioned above. Or you can increase the Drone's movement range.\n\n  \n3 - Don't let Crypto take damage from his own ultimate. This makes him more aggressive. You want to use your ultimate before starting a fight, but your teammates don't wait for you. When they fall, they ask where you are. The community needs this buff more than Crypto. Since Crypto can't play aggressively, players who constantly play Crypto are bullied.",

Which is something we don't want.\n\nWe want the game to feel more alive, more responsive to the community, and more fresh when you come back each season - which is why we've shifted towards more frequent, impactful ( and sometimes overly spicy ) meta changes that affect a wider swath of Legends and players - to drive a new flavour into Apex, see what sticks, what doesn't and continue to evolve and grow the game.\n\n\n\nSo, if by regular pace, you mean a Legend each season - it is very likely we won't see that in the near future.\n\nBut Legends are still in development, and new Legends will rise as often as we can while trying to push on evolving the game in between.",

However, these changes rely on mechanics that were previously addressed by devs as problematic or can easily be seen as exploitable and abusable.\n\nFor example:\n\t\n\u2022\tPathfinder\u2019s grapple was nerfed in early seasons for being too unpredictable, yet Ash\u2019s Dash is now an even simpler version of it. And as reactionary as pre-nerfed Wraith\u2019s Q.\n\t\n\u2022\tWallHack abilities have been consistently nerfed across multiple patches for being unhealthy meta, yet now they\u2019re added back to Assault class perk. Especially concerning since Bangalore is also assault class.\n\t\n\u2022\tLoba\u2019s instant 99% ult charge was acknowledged as a temporary buff, then removed again.\n\t\n\u2022\tThe support double-heal perk was removed after being seen as selfish.\n\nThese buffs undeniably increase a legend\u2019s power, but many of them seem to create long-term balance issues and provide power that doesn\u2019t requiring much player execution.\n\n1. What makes you choose to introduce these types of buffs, despite their potential for abuse or the fact that some are just returning previously mechanics considered as problematic? Is there a long-term plan to create healthier, more execution-based buffs that promote strategic play instead of just raw power for certain character/class? or is it just pure meta shift season by season?\n\n2. Also, by constantly changing how certain mechanics work\u2014especially after removing them\u2014do you feel that it devalues the time and effort players put into practicing or adapting to these mechanics? Since many of these buffs end up being revisited or removed much later due to their obvious issues, does this create a cycle where players invest in mastering something, only for it to become obsolete once balance adjustments inevitably roll back problematic changes?",

                    "body": "Really good questions\n\nMany of these recent buffs come from a place of trying to solve for the design intent of an ability or moment.\n\nFor example, Ash's Dash was a result of seeing the problem where Ash would snare an enemy - then have no clean way to move up and capitalize on her efforts.\n\nOr with the Assault's Battle Surge scan - the goal was to incentivize pushing on the shield crack, and showing the enemy you cracked as \"fresh meat\" is a pretty strong \"go git em\" call to action.\n\n\n\nInternally, the team immediately calls out the potency of these changes, and in previous times that would have been where those changes would stop. We would recognize the potential for an overpowered state, cut the feature, and move on to a more nuanced and well balanced solution instead.\n\nHowever, what we've seen as a result, is that players generally don't pick up on that nuance - if the feature doesn't have obvious face-value power, it doesn't just not get abused - it doesn't get used at all. No one tries to exploit it, no one tries to counter it. No one adapts, learns or grows - and we as developers don't get data to see whether something was actually really bad or just a new vector that takes time to learn.\n\nSo we've been trying to be much less conservative recently. We want to make sure we hit the goal, and it has an impact - and from there we can evaluate which parts are overtuned, truly exploitative or unnecessary and dial those back - which we've seen with the adjustments to the duration of the Battle Surge scan time, Ash's Dash and upgrades, Loba's Ult on land and Gibby's bubble hard counters.\n\n\n\nIn short: Make sure the goal hits, let people have fun first and prove the real problems, then dial into a healthier place as new things come online.\n\n\n\nIn terms of where we're at with regards to balancing class identities - we have Skirmisher's left to take the stage, and we will likely see each class settle into a healthier place in time afterwards, just as the support class did come the launch of season 24\n\nI don't think the idea that we want to see a more active shift in the meta season over season is mutually exclusive to the empowerment of a class or character - Ensuring we hit on the goals and impact of change helps with both of these angles, and keeps the game feeling fresh and interesting to learn and adapt to.",

Same goes for weapons, I would like to see a small buff for the RE45, but overall they all feel great now! \n\nI do have 6 quick questions:\n\n1. Has the team considered bringing back helmets at least? I feel looting now is a little redundant and you really only do it for ammo and heals, you have essentially removed any excitement from finding a purple helmet (or armor RIP). Finding purple mags/stocks is exciting, but seems to be extremely rare now. I understand the want to remove rng, but I feel a healthy amount is good for a battle Royale. Nothing like landing a finding something purple that would give a slight advantage for that first fight. \n\n2. The Ash dash is very interesting since without it she would still be good. You guys have essentially opened a can or warms with it! Has the team considered bringing on more unique movement passives? An idea would be moving Revenants pounce over into a passive and return his silence orbs. Another would be giving Octane a permanent double jump. Another would be Horizon having a mini lift passive, hold down jump and she slightly lifts for a short amount of time.\n\n3. How often does the team check reddit? \n\n4. Can we get any updates on the chances of seeing an energy pistol added? Or at least Fade and Rhapsody being added in? \n\n5. I was actually wondering if the team has ever talked about introducing a 6 game tournament, played on every map, and teams cannot chose the same legend twice (meaning every game your team will have a completely different legend comp)(think how Battlefield has Rush and other multi match modes where you play multiple matches in 1 game). Something like this either for the main game as a side mode or an actual tournament would be very fun and interesting. \n\n6. Is there any reason as to why the team didn\u2019t use other legends for Launch Royale (my favorite LTM). I was very disappointed to not see Rev or prime Seer in it\n\nOverall, once again, I have to say thank you and good job on fixing the legend balance! The new TTK feels refreshing (although I do feel the pain for newer players).",

We have considered more unique movement passives - we even tried exploring some of them with Revenant in his development before settling on the Shadow Pounce as a Tactical.\n\nMoving the pounce to a passive isn't something we've talked about yet, but it's an interesting take. But we have been considering this for other Legends and are evaluating those angles - we just have to be cautious of how we index into this and where it makes the most sense to do so to not turn the whole game into a blur of unreadable movement.\n\nThe trouble we were seeing with the old silence orb tactical was that it encouraged Revenant to stay back and poke, or zone areas off - which didn't really suit him.\n\nWe really wanted to push his fantasy into a much more aggressive light to better fit his character - which the pounce, low health passive and ultimate did for him.\n\nDoesn't mean he can't change or improve in the future though!",

I feel the pounce plus the silence would have great synergy, plus it would bring some needed team utility back to his kit that still suites his personality.

It enlarged the span between those who play aggressively because now they have weapons that kill faster and indirectly do more damage in the head, and those who play gently because they will be even more pressured to use covers and other movement strategies. However, I do have 2 questions : \n\n- why was the sentinel left behind overall ? Not only did it not receive any buff unlike other guns but it also got removed its built-in hop-up without any way to compensate for the removal (like a ROF buff for example)\n\n- what was the expected outcome by increasing the R99 and CAR damages by 2 points instead of 1 ?",

I'll chat Sentinel with the team at our next weapons sync and we'll see how it's doing. \n\nAs far as the SMG damage increases go we were hoping to see some more diversity in CQC loadouts so shotguns didn't feel so mandatory.",

So we likely need to look at Seer from multiple angles to get him out of obscurity.\n\n\n\nWe are not likely to see all characters have Ash's passive or Lifeline's glide.\n\nWe actually tried that internally - and it was a pretty confusing mess. You couldn't tell who could do what, building tops and second floors were suddenly able to be accosted by everyone in a squad. No where was safe, and tracking player movements or capitalizing on any well planned long-range assaults was difficult and frustrating.

Also, pls never ever bring relics back, we don\u2019t like them, like pls.

This is something we actually thought about a lot across the development of Arsenals.  \nTo make them activate after everyone has dropped, we\u2019d have to pause their activation for about 100 seconds (very near the time evo harvesters activate). However, doing this also significantly diminishes their use as a way for players to deterministically find the weapons they are looking for. Newer/lower experience players typically don\u2019t notice they come online, and our more experienced players often will already have their loadout set and won\u2019t change them even if they don\u2019t like their weapons as much. This ultimately causes Arsenals that \u201cactivate\u201d later on to fail at their core goals of giving players more choice in what weapons they run and getting you out of the \u201clooting\u201d stage quicker. We instead opted to tune how much ammo Arsenals give you in the early game as well as typically placing them in open areas or areas that don\u2019t have as much loot around. This way, you have a set path to get the gun you want, but in an early game fight you have to consider if it is worth being in a worse position with less loot.",

The passive dash is more powerful than any movement based tactical (she needs to be moved to skirmisher btw). Consider changing the purple upgrade to either two ults or a single dash. The ult range needs to be reduced, it's the most powerful pushing/rotational tool Apex has ever seen.\n\nWhy are wallhacks still being added?\n\nThe assault passive in general is insane.
