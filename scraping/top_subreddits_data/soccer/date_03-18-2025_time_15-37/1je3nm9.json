He is hell bent to completely punish Barca and he doesn't care if he will have to bend the rules to do so. He is so far gone from being an unbiased president, it starts to feel like someone has made a caricature of what an unbiased villain FA president would be. And he is also a Madrid supporter, but he HATES Florentino Perez so he isn't even doing it to prop up Madrid! All that and you can still say that his worst attribute is that he is a far-right nutjob (and no I don't mean right wing, he is genuinely far-right). Like, I have a couple of acquaintances supporting Rayo and while they do agree with some/most of his decisions regarding the league/clubs, they can't stand the dude because he is not only a nutjob but he is also fairly outspoken about it. \n\nIt's literally as if someone made a sitcom and created an outlandish evil character in a managerial position",

And there is plenty of ocasions where match times have been moved, so you at least play at the same hour you did 72 hours ago.\n\nAnd this past matchweek, Madrid played at ~17, having played 3 days ago at 21. So yeah, less than 72 hours. Thats what Ancelotti was crying about. They could have moved the game to 21.00, but they would have lost TV revenue",
