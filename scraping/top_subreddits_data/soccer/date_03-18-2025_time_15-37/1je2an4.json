If the xG for a penalty is 0.75 then the chance that the attacking team is being robbed of needs to be close to that or a different punishment should be given.\n\nI think I'd create a second 'area'. So we keep the current shape of the box and that's where the keeper can handle it, being fouled here will just get you a free kick. Then we extend the six yard box out to the edge of the box and this can be the width that would draw a penalty if you're fouled inside.

He's never injured, looks after himself and has become a lot smarter with how he conserves energy throughout games.\n\nNow the major reason I see no risk in this is that, even if he did fall off a cliff next year, he is the most attractive asset to Saudi Arabia outside of the absolute elite younger talents (Mbappe, Haaland, Vini). Next summer Saudi Arabia are 100% still willing to spend silly money on him even if he does have a down year, so theres little risk in paying him the money he likely wants.\n\nThen for new players, if they come in and want that money as well, tell them if they perform like Salah for a decade they'll get it as well.

The new offside procedure also renders linesman largely ineffective as they have to wait until way after when they would usually flag before they can actually do so.\n\nSo could we get to the point with technology that coverage and cameras and their latency get good enough that you don't really need officials there at all?

We would still need trained referees and those dedicated enough will at least aspire to be professional. If you don\u2019t have referees at professional level then you won\u2019t have them at amateur level.\n\nAlso, you need some kind of authority figure on the field. Someone to maintain some kind of order over the very basics. Just telling the players where to restart play from or to communicate with the players. It would be very bizarre to watch a game of football without a referee.",

Man City won the league and Haaland scores 36 league goals. This is where I apply the opinions that led to me the initial statement. That Man City is better than this season's Man City. Arsenal finished second. That team is actually basically the same team as now, with little to no improvement. Manchester United finished 3rd, they're now much worse. Very similar team, probably slight improvement. Then it's Liverpool, Brighton, Villa and Spurs. I would argue that one Villa have improved their starting 11 and squad (despite Liverpool League performances being better this year).",
