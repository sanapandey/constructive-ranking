Last season, my old coach called me because the team was short of players for one of the last games of the season due to injuries. For me, of course, it was a point of honour. I was straight into the starting eleven and had to be substituted after 20 minutes with a torn muscle fibre. I completely underestimated the intensity of football. Once the body is no longer used to the strain, the risk of injury increases rapidly.",

If you never sprint and are then forced to do it many times in a long session, your muscles will be injury prone no matter how good your cardio is. Coming back from injury is so tricky too because sprinting and changing direction includes much more strain. You might be able to run a decent pace for a long distance after an injury, but it's so easy to trick yourself into thinking you can sprint 100%. I've reinjured myself a few times this way.",
