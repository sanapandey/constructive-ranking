There would be almost no way of defending the case if not arguing his injuries were necessarily bad because the crash was very hard, but it wasn't exceptional for the type of play.\n\nIt, of course, failed because it was clearly an exceptionally hard challenge with awful consequences, but neither Millwall nor the lawyers crossed any ethical bounds with the defense as presented IMO.",

The worst of the 'fans' come from outside the city just to pull their BS most of the time too. \n\nThe ownership is kind of boring compared to other clubs, which can be both good and bad. They don't rock the boat much which is good for the club financially, but they let a lot slide that they shouldn't in doing that.\n\nRacism side is present especially with the older generation of fans. A few of them have that antiquated 80-90s \"He's alright if he's on our team\" mentality to it, while happily getting out the insults on opposing teams players... until they sign for Millwall and they suddenly retract it all... Ah, the double standard.\n\nWhat I wish is that the Southwark local area had another decent tier club that could actually serve as a rival. It'd hoover up a lot of people... I see people who support teams way down the pyramid just to avoid Millwall but stay local. Fisher FC anyone? Haha",
