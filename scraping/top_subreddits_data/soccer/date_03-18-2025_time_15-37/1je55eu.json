I\u2019ve been sent several models, and I\u2019ll have to choose between those that just cover the ear and others that cover the whole face.\u201d\n\n>\u201cI told [Liam Roberts], \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not that serious,\u2019 \u201d Mateta said. \u201cHe could have avoided doing that, but these things happen.\u201d",

You couldn\u2019t just hoist this on to current professionals. \n\nBut at the same time this is a global sport played by lots of kids in regions that wouldn\u2019t have the resources/desire to implement head gear requirements in youth sports. \n\nI just don\u2019t see it happening. It\u2019s the kind of thing that would have needed to be ingrained in the sport early on. IIRC American football didn\u2019t use helmets at first. But back in the 20s and 30s there were literally people dying on the field constantly, so they were forced to adopt helmets early on.",
