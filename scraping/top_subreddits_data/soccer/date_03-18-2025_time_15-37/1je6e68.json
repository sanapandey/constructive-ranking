He took his work very seriously and this would make him go beyond mad.\n\nHis boss was a carbon copy of my dad in terms of punctuality and taking other people's time seriously. Once they had a meeting in a pretty known religious place in Portugal with the priests and the people responsible over that whole thing. The fucking priests turned up 3 hours late (!!!). My father's boss is a bit of a madlad so first thing he says to the priest is that if there's truly hell he belongs there for making him wait for 3 hours in that fucking place.\n\nSuffice to say that meeting didn't go very well. My father's boss was livid as they missed on another extremely important appointment over that bullshit.

What else do people want?  \n\nremember, my original comment was response to someone saying Deschamps let him of \"lightly,\" which i  just find so silly. \n\ni am going to assume that my English has failed me, and i didn't articulate my point well enough. Rather than people lacking basic nuance and being stuck in their very  own black and white thinking",

Well Cantona, his name speaks for himself lol).   \nIt's under him that they went from \"France can't do it on the big stage\" to 1998 world champs, and under his assistant that they grabbed the euros 2 years later.\n\nIt clearly had a lot of impact on how Deschamps sees international football, and reflects a lot of the way he made the teams.\n\nDon't let that fool you tho, he knows how to talk sharply. And when he does he barely raises his voice and it really really conveys the disapointment through, he switches from caring grandpa to passive agressive with barely a tone change, and yet everyone in the room feels it lol.",
