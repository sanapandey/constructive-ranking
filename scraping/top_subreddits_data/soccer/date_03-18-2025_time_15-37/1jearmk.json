If that water bottle has been used by someone carrying a virus that can be spread by saliva, it becomes a potential method of transmission.\n\nAfter all, that's the reason spitting is considered a serious issue by the authorities. For example, one could permanently contract a type of herpes in their eyes if an infected person with an outbreak were to spit in them. So we come down hard on spitting largely for public health reasons, not because it's some grevious physical assault.",
