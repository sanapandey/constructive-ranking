On one side, you have the \"cartel\" clubs, pushing for the PL to punish City. Which is why we have this case in the first place. On the other side, you have City with their state influence trying to make it go away.\n\nThe PL is literally just the 20 clubs that are in it. The owners of those clubs all have massive influence, whether that be enormous wealth or, in the case of City/Newcastle, state backing.\n\nAcknowledging this fact is valid, but that's why the IC is independent of all these influences. I don't think it's fair to assume these judges are corrupt without any substantive evidence. I could equally say the IC judges are being bribed by the likes of Arsenal and United. If you ask me for proof I'll just say the same thing you did. \"The Americans are known for their propensity to bribe and blackmail\". You see how ridiculous that sounds?",

Then you have them commenting on Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea etc and they revert to soundbites and lazy analysis. \n\nAs fans of those clubs, we follow them obsessively. We live and breath information relating to our respective clubs. We know all the background, the main characters, the minor characters, we know all the problems in depth, we can see the positives even when everything looks to be falling apart from the outside.\n\nSo when you have people less informed on the minutiae setting the narrative for your club to all the other non-fans, it's incredibly aggravating. Neville can set the narrative for United, Carragher can set the narrative for Liverpool - they are experts in their clubs. It's grating for me to see them do the same for, in my case, Arsenal and I'm sure fans of other clubs feel the same.",

I think on Quansah's competetive debut one Liverpool pundit was talking about him being an exciting, attacking left back. Quansah was probably the breakout star of preseason and featured in a lot of games as a centre back, Klopp had talked about him positively, there was a lot of excitement in the fanbase about him so it's not like he was a complete nobody, you'd expect a pundit that has connections at the club to be at least somewhat familiar with him.",

Juve, Milan, Lazio and Fiorentina. Inter were also involved, but they hid the evidence until the statute of limitations passed, so they weren't punished and were even gifted a league title for coming third. Meanwhile, Inter's ex-president Facchetti was on wiretaps that show him trying to intimidate and bribe referees.\n\nInter and their allies (club shareholders, executives) ran the company that recorded and leaked the wiretaps (Telecom), ran the commission investigating Calciopoli, ran the newspaper that leaked the right wiretaps in their frontpages to create a popular sentiment and climate against Juve (Gazzetta).  \n\nSuch lovely people as Guido Rossi (FIGC comissioner and \u201creal Interista who avoids coffee at the juventus bar\" according to Gazetta), Marco Tronchetti Provera (Telecom Italia president and 2nd biggest Inter shareholder who released the Juve tapes and hid the Inter recordings then resigned the next year from Telecom), Carlo Buora (Inter vice president and Telecom managing director).\n\nFIGC investigator Stefano Palazzi found Facchetti lobbying referees (beyond what Moggi was proven to do) but was too late for the statute of limitations, a bit like City's case against UEFA. Coincidentally, Vieri\u2019s phone was being tapped by Telecom and Inter in 2006\u2026\n\nAll Calciopoli refs were acquitted except De Santis, who had nothing to do with Juve but had received calls by former Inter player and then-executive Facchetti)\n\nThat\u2019s how Inter dominated for the next years up to the treble, by trying to destroy their superiors and in the process destroying the Serie A, the best league at the time.",
