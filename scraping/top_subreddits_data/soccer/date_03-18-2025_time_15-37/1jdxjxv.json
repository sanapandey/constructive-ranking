That means the corruption that takes place in the UK drives corruption in hundreds of countries, so if you want to understand corruption, you must recognise the role of UK-based financial institutions at the centre of a nexus of global corruption.\n\nIt is also naive of you to state that this form of corruption is 'limited to the very biggest corporations' when those corporations, and the corruption they facilitate, hold massive economic and political power. \n\nFurther to all of this, corruption in Western financial institutions caused the 2008 economic crash, which I should not have to explain was profoundly damaging to the entire global population. \n\nSo, while it is correct to state that the UK is, on the surface level, far less corrupt than Uzbekistan, it belies a deeper and more systemic understanding of corruption and how it operates. It isn't just 'something that happens over there, in those poor countries, disconnected from Western capital and political institutions'.",
