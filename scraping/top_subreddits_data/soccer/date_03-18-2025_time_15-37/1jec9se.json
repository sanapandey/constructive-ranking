But I mean the player always has an opinion on this too and obviously players always want to play. Kim clearly felt like he could play so he played. Over the past couple weeks or so Minjae had I think 2 instances where he didn\u2019t start a game and Eric Dier came in (and played well too) but then Upamecano got hurt so Minjae stepped in again. \n\nI think at first Kompany was hesitant to play Dier because he\u2019s definitely lacking the pace of Kim and Upa but Dier is so good with his positioning and ball playing that he\u2019s figured out how to mitigate his lack of pace issues. So yeah, Dier has started to play a bit more recently as the 3rd option to rotate either of Kim and Upa but this only recently started happening. \n\nUltimately tho Kim has decided to keep playing. He got \u201crest\u201d from practice time to time and I\u2019m sure the medical staff was monitoring him closely. While I understand the frustration of Korea, I just think it really came down to Kim wanting to push through.\n\nE: clarity",
