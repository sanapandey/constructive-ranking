For some reason they benched him at PSV when he was - as I've heard - solid as well for a goalkeeper they sold after a season anyways but wouldn't let him in. And that was the end of it for Tyto\u0144 in greater European football. Relegation tier European sides, a stint in America and now warming the bench at Twente.\n\nSad, really.",
