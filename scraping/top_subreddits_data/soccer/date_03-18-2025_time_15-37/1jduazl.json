They had a meteoric rise and went from the third tier of Bolivian football in 2022 to the Divisi\u00f3n Profesional in 2024, and are now contesting a continental competition.\n\nBut the original San Jos\u00e9 never really folded, returned to the football pyramid in 2023 and, in 2025, will be in the second tier of Bolivian football, vying for a place in top-flight again. There's now a split within supporters between those who moved their allegiances to GV San Jos\u00e9 and those who remain loyal to the original San Jos\u00e9.",

Some chapters lead to the next chronologically, (like 1994 to 1998) but eventually he will tie in an idea to one that came before and go back and look at that earlier influence and what it led to. The theme is common threads throughout Brazilian football, rather than linear evolution.\n\nI'd love to tackle a project translating concepts like that into English, but my experience is in others areas entirely and I am sure there are many qualified people for that.

            "body": "There's a very weird power struggle happening right now in Serie A in pretty much all the top clubs. Milan, Juve, Atalanta, Roma and even Napoli all have things going on in the background that could end up shaking the league next season. Even Inter are changing their direction so there could be some drama there too.\n\nMilan are in the middle of two owners each looking to control the club. The recent news is that Giorgio Furlani, who's Elliott's guy in the management, is now the one solely in charge of choosing the next sporting director. The biggest rumor right now is the former Spurs and Juve sporting director Fabio Paratici, who will be bringing in Allegri alongside him. \n\nThe Guintoli and Motta project, outside of one week, has been objectively a failure. And the recent news is that both Guintoli and Motta could be on the chopping blocks even before the season ends. There's also a couple of rumors about Agnelli looking to get back into power, but that's still fan fiction at this point. The main story here is who replaces Guintoli as the sporting director?\n\nAtalanta on the other hand don't really have anything drastic going on behind the scenes except that there's a nuke that could drop on their heads at any second because the rumors are that Gasperini is potentially leaving in the summer. If that were to happen, what would Gasperini do afterwards? Who would Atalanta go for? Would D'Amico (the sporting director) go with him?\n\nRoma are on the hunt for a new manager. Their recent performances have helped to cool things down massively, but Ranieri has been clear that he's transitioning to a director role after the season ends. Do Roma look elsewhere for a manager? Or do they go with the traditional route and get a name known to everyone? But considering that there has been zero news about who the next manager is gonna be, it seems like Roma themselves haven't really made a decision on what to do yet.\n\nNow for Conte, the situation is exactly the same as everyone predicted. The club didn't invest in new players after selling Kvara, and their recent form point towards an inevitable meltdown from Conte that may lead to his dismissal. But even then, Conte proved that at the very least, he can still find success in the league. So if the inevitable occurs, would someone else decide to try their luck and try to lure Conte? And for Napoli, what's next? If things go south in the next two months, it could turn out to be a really ugly summer for them. And if not, would De Laurentiis put up with Conte for another year if they don't win the league?\n\nInter are living their best life, fighting for three trophies. But this next summer will be the first where their new owners have total control over the arrivals and departures. The new direction for them means no more free transfers and an emphasis on young talents that have room to grow. Plus the question of the wage bill. Inter will probably let a few of their older players like Acerbi and Darmian leave in the summer which will help with reducing the wage bill, but will we see one massive departure? Hakan seems like someone that Inter could potentially let go of for the right price.\n\nReally interested to see how all of this shapes up.",

Fortunately we progress the ball up the pitch so slowly that when that happens we still have ten players in our own half and it's only been punished with a goal 4 or 5 times.\n\nPlus how bad our defence is is vastly overstated.

Maybe we could stop leaving our wingers completed isolated 1 v 1 and often 1 v 2 for 90 minutes each week? That might stretch the play and allow someone other than Palmer to create chances while also generating space for Palmer to operate in. \n\nMaybe we could stop inverting our fullback into an attacking midfield role so that the likes of Cucurella and Gusto aren't receiving the ball on the edge of the box instead of someone with creative ability. \n\nMaybe we could stop having the slowest build up I have ever watched at the club inviting every opposition to get into their defensive shape before we try and attack like the match is some sort of training drill.\n\n> Multiple build-up blunders by defense & Gk have already costed this Chelsea team lot a points.\n\nYes. The goalkeepers are not good enough on the ball. A good manager might adapt to that. \n\nIt's not just that though, it's structural deficiencies meaning we are predictable and therefore much easier to press against. Our defenders get a lot of the stick, and they have made their fair share of mistakes, but in terms of errors leading to opposition shots Rob Sanchez is by far and away the biggest offender with Enzo Fernandez following him.",

We don't need 2 new starting forwards. One would definitely be nice to replace Nunez, but Gakpo and Diaz are more than good enough to play for us relative to what our domestic rivals have.\n\nWe need a left back, no arguments there. A right back is entirely dependent on what Trent does.\n\nWe need a 4th choice midfielder to replace Endo. Someone in that role shouldn't be making or breaking a season though.\n\n>Henry can be quite tight with the cash\n\nMoney is and has clearly been there to spend the last few years, our recruitment team are just willing to wait for the right players rather than splashing obscene cash and wages on the first player to become available. That's generally worked out quite well for us under Edwards.\n\n>Then I don\u2019t see the players they would want to sell (Tsimikas, Kelleher, Diaz, Jota, Nunez) getting a lot of money.\n\nThis is just delusion.

Rivals always act as though there will be no market for players who we want to shift and act as though our initial asking prices are absurd and quickly shut up when we get every penny we were reportedly asking for. It's happened time and time again, the most recent example was van den Berg going to Brentford when a group suddenly became very concerned with his welfare.",

It is knee-jerk and there's no indication the club is looking to sell him beyond supporters whining about him online. Maybe that will change, but until now there's been no reports about the club looking to move him on or about the player wanting to move on.\n\n>Kelleher will be third choice in the summer, so Liverpool won\u2019t have as much bargaining power with him\n\nWe can come back to this in 4 months. He'll absolutely go for \u00a320m minimum. Again, remarkable how people bury their heads in the sand with how well we've sold players consistently. \n\n>Tsimikas was bought for 15m, has been shit and is nearly 30.\n\nAgain, zero nuance. He's been okay.\n\nAnyway, we can leave it there. I've heard the same shite from United supporters for the past several seasons - we were done after 20/21, Van Dijk and co. were finished after 22/23 and United under Ten Hag were on the up, we were going to drop off massively after Klopp left us vs United who were busy winning the transfer window with their shiny new director of football who didn't last 6 months. \n\nIn reality we're on our way to #20.",

But based on what other similar ability players have gone for, and the already existing interest in both players, I\u2019d be amazed if they don\u2019t go for at least about 60m a pop each (if they\u2019re for sale). Put that together with Kelleher (25m) and Tsimikas and Morton (15-20 each) and that\u2019s approaching \u00a3200m to spend before the club have even entertained selling anyone else who would also bring in good money like Harvey Elliott, Quansah, or Ben Doak. And that\u2019s all before they\u2019ve used any of their record revenues. \n\n\nLiverpool will be absolutely minted this summer in all likelihood and I appreciate its hard to hear for people like you desperate to predict their downfall.",

Liverpool is also in a great position, with a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Vienna to qualify for the European Cup semifinals. Manchester United can have a tough time at Hungary, as Videoton can be a difficult rival in a hostile environment - the Red Devils carry a one-goal advantage from the first leg. Worst of all, sadly, is Tottenham. They have to overcome the own goal by Steve Perryman in the first leg at the mighty Bernab\u00e9u stadium in Madrid.\n\n*One of these matches will be featured in Sportsnight, on Wednesday night on BBC1.*\n\nAlso, some Canon League football to feast your eyes: in Division One, there's a battle against relegation, as Watford and Luton face again for the fourth time in two weeks. Also, Arsenal's last train for the League race against Ipswich, Leicester's visit to Newcastle, and Nottingham Forest v Sheffield Wednesday. In Division Two, only one match - but one important for the promotion fight: Manchester City v Birmingham City, leaders v sixth. In Division Three, the most interesting match is Hull, in second, facing Lincoln. Lastly, in Division Four, the top 4 faces each other: Bury v Darlington and Hereford v Chesterfield.\n\nIn the Freight Rover Trophy, four matches will be played: one from the first round and three from the second round.",

I know we always talk about R9\u2019s potential but Neymar was so complete as a player during his early years with PSG. Goalscorer, pace, and playmaker at the same time and at an insanely high level too. Only player I can compare him to in modern time was Messi in 2014/15 in terms of completeness as a forward.\n\nI think his nickname of \u201cThe Prince Who Never Became King\u201d fits him well. Overall, he probably isn\u2019t a top 5 Brazilian player ever in terms of legacy which makes it all the more disappointing",

If Est\u00eav\u00e3o, already being made to play out of position to buffer his market valuation, flops at Chelsea I think it will lead  to at least some reconsideration for the current model of shipping the best players abroad at 17.\n\nRealistically though, I think expecting a World Cup out of any one player is frankly insane even by Latin standards and that's not even thinking about how the sport has gotten vastly more competitive since 2000.

Zico is maybe above Neymar even though he has less to show for it because of his main man performances with Flamengo. Neymar was never the main man over the course of the season because of his injuries in PSG and only was a main man with Brazil with similar performances as Zico",

Zico the player is a ghost. Short of having a WC as the star a contemporary player is never going to be considered Zico's peer because of the emotional heft of what memories of Zico mean to people who watched him or learned about the sport from people who watched him. R10 is basically a religious figure on this board, for example, for a \\*lot\\* of reasons outside of who he was as a player. As it'll be the case for CR7 even in the case of a future Portuguese forward who scores 35 goals a year in the PL and wins the WC.\n\nI generally don't know Brazilian fans to really care about what players achieve in Europe. People and the press are generally invested in that stupid globe because a Brazilian hasn't won it in almost 20 years now but besides that all the goals and etc in Europe mean nothing (\\*maybe at Barcelona/RM, simply because tradition) but really what matters is national team + who you were/are in South American football, because that's what people actually watch. Roberto Firmino is a nobody amongst Brazilian fans, for example.  My ex from Porto Alegre couldn't possibly tell you anything about Rodrygo being clutch in UCL. She just knows him as the wanker from Santos who's supposed to be good but can't turn in a performance for country. What she cares about is Gremio, the national team, and Raphinha (from Porto Alegre.)\n\nHad Neymar stayed his entire career at Santos and won a few more Copa Libertadores without being such a gigantic cunt he would be as regarded as anyone who hasn't won the WC in that country.",

Every single one of them are killing a bit of their football soul and their connection to Brazilian football when they leave so early. I was hoping for Estevao to stay more but the most meme thing happened. \n\nStill am not surprised that the only player to understand Diniz's system was Neymar.",

It is hard to reminisce about past conquers when you're excited more about the future.\n\n\nWhen Cristiano left utd, you would see is he the best to play at Old Trafford (a comparison to a George best/Charlton..)rather than \"is he a legend?\" Although he would be fit for a legend, there was a possibility he could write more story at the club in addition to seeing him write unique stories elsewhere. Legend discussions mostly appears at the twilight of players' careers or after a decade+ of serving.",
