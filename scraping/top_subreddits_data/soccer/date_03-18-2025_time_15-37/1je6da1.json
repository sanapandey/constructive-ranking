Would be a great way to ease Fitz Jim in on the long term while strengthning our team on the short term. We miss a creative midfielder like that.  \n\nHenderson is at the end of his contract in the summer so both the age bit and the salary bit would have that covered. \n\n\nAccording to whoscored he still played 41 matches this season, so his legs aren't entirely gone at all as well. Would slot right into our team. \n\nWe still have a bunch of young players. Look at the starters against AZ who are 23 or under: Gaaei, Baas, Hato, Fitz-Jim, Taylor, Brobbey, Godts. \n\nThose are 7 players haha. Only 4 of the starting 11 are older then 23. And that is our strongest team except for Pasveer, but Matheus isnt young either so that doesn't offset the numbers. \n\nBut I do feel your sentiment though, you want a couple of players on their prime and only Sutalo and Traore are between 25-29. Thats the age were they peak physically. So adding a 33 year old doesn't help in that aspect.",

After years of unwavering loyalty, it's becoming clear that the soccer team\u2019s current direction no longer aligns with the passion and commitment I have cherished as a fan from the states.\n\nI will always respect the history and legacy of the soccer club, but recent performances and lack of our progress have made it difficult to continue supporting with the same enthusiasm.\n\nPlease sack Amorim.\n\nThank you for the memories. It\u2019s time to move on to other Manchester.\n\nSincerely,\nDie hard fan since 1997 (Sorry Sir Ferguson)",
