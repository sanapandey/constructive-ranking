I don't think you can just ignore that it's failed and caused an issue, in one of the first times it's been used in a major competition. \n\nOf course we don't know how long was spent trying to use the technology vs when they switched to the manual check but given it's caused another delay, I'd suggest it was a significant contribution. \n\nI think people are way too harsh on the league, if they aren't confident on its accuracy and usability then it's right to delay its use.",

Although again that's had its own issues this seasons that you can't ignore. \n\nBut that decision has been and gone, they've decided to go for a different and supposedly a more accurate technology overall and if it's not ready they shouldn't force through a flawed technology. They'll keep trialling it in the background of league games and hopefully we won't have any more failures.",
