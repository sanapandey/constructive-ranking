    "selftext": "Not long ago, Yosuke's Japanese VA Showtaro Morikubo, attracted hatred from the Chinese for participating in a reading play \"\u547d\u304c\u3051\u306e\u8a3c\u8a00\" related to the China\u2019s Uyghur detention camps. At present, Chinese games such as Genshin Impact and Arknights have decided to replace the characters he is responsible for. At the same time, the Chinese Persona community also strongly requested Atlus to replace Yosuke's Japanese VA in the future Persona 4 Remake and Persona 5: The Phantom X. Considering that Persona 5: The Phantom X is a game that Atlus cooperated with the Chinese production team, maybe this is possible? What do you think of this uproar?",

            "body": "I would expect him to be replaced on P5X (which after all is developed by a Chinese studio) but not in any P4G remake.  \n\nFirstly, any P4 x P5X crossover is likely to happen fairly soon, but a P4 remake is likely years away.  Not to mention there would be uproar in Japan if he were to be removed by a *Japanese* company, given the status JP VAs have in that country.\n\nIf he's being wholesale replaced in Chinese games, it's a good chance that that has come down from the government, so the P5X developers wouldn't have a choice.  This is the country that prohibits mentioning Winnie-the-Pooh, because Xi got that as a nickname.\n\nPerhaps it would even be split and he'd be redubbed for the CN P5X server, but retained for the KR and TW ones.",

As for overseas developers I don't see this happening at all because it would be promoting condemnation against those who depict any such real events and it'd be a global issue much like Blizzard when they cowardly banned the HeartStone player for wishing for the freedom of Hong Kong. Outside of that though I don't see anything happening. \n\nTypically though when the Chinese player base throw a tantrum they will do so on Weibo there social media platform but it doesn't really seem to have happened there nor has Persona 4 Golden been review bombed on steam which makes me think his removal from Genshin likely was a request from higher up. Naturally Genshin is a chinese developer as well so I can understand why it'd happen in that particular game.",

The fact about Xi Jingping was pissed about the memes is true though, lol.\n\nAnyways Kim Il Sung did WORSE in North Korea when he declaired JAMES FREAKING BOND a STATE FREAKING ENEMY because he watched Die Another Day \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 (he 100% did it because the North Koreans were the bad guys, but I love to think that he hated the film because it was SO BAD \ud83d\ude02)",

We'll have to see if the Chinese pressure is enough to make an exception, but I personally find it unlikely to happen anytime soon.",

Genshin Impact doesn't surprise me, it's a chinese developers looking to exploit 2 billion children with the kind of slop you'd expect from any moba. Atlus though, they don't have to.",

As for what's being said, it's disgusting and I could only hope if Atlus ever catch this they kindly tell them to >!fuck off!<. If they don't want him to be a part of games or art released that's fine they're welcome to they like but anyone actually wishing death on the man for just doing his job is not someone worth acknowledging. That said, I hope that doesn't cause offence to you or your friend and I appreciate you sharing it. \n\nAs for what Atlus will do, they really don't have to do anything as I don't think he's been announced for 5X and if they have issues with P4G they can just delist it in China. I don't think they'd ever blacklist Mr Morikubo given he's done absolutely nothing wrong and as for 5X I'm just going to assume he won't be introduced into the game even if P4 is as I think changing the VO would only highlight the issue rather than fix it.",
