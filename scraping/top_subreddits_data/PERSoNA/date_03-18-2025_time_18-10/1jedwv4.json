The game has a weighted EXP system so if you get a hit in you get a greater share of the EXP. you always want the protaganist to go first so that they always get more EXP. It also determines dodge rate which is the best way to be \"Tanky\" in the game.\n\nDex on the other hand determines gun damage and hit rate. Guns are very good since the SMG the protagonist carries is multi hit and the way status ailments bullet work every hit has a chance to inflict the status ailment.\n\nIt should be noted too that as long as you're keeping up with fusions no stat will really lag behind since persona give stat bonuses.",

Each option of each character will inflict a certain % of some emotion which is decided by their personality traces like if you play/make a joke to a playful demon it will increase their happiness or even interest but if it is a serious demon it will probably increase its angriness.\n\nWhen any of the emotions is completely full(or even 2 having different results) they will do something around that like sadness they will just go away, happy they will either gain the happy debuff(chance to skip his turn) or possibly give you an item or heal you and go away, angry they will either gain a buff I don't remember exactly or cause you damage/give you debuff and in some cases go away after doing, lastly is the interest the will give you 3 options, give item, heal you and give his card, the last one is the most important because the only way for you to fuse/create personas is using them so you really need to learn to negotiate.\n\nLastly is that no character is perfect as some can't make certain demons happy or interested like the yellow hat kid Just have playful actions and one intimidation/flirt(the silent stare works for I think female schoolgirl zombie as interest) and can't do anything other than anger serious demons so you need to play around with all options with all characters to understand how each trace of the demons react with them (Also be aware that when you start to negotiate with one demon you can't just stop or negotiate with other demon you need to end that negotiation).",
