I did wanted to try a little bit to be honest since the rap songs I was hearing in Japan back in the days were not my \"go to\", got me thinking maybe I could be one. I do remember Argentina, loved the steaks, loved the fans. The organizer messed up big time and the convention didn't open until 14:00 which in turn forced some fans to leave since they had to catch a flight. That depressed me but the fans were amazing.",
