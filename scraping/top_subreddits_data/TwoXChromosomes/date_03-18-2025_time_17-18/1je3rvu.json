I'm 35 and he is 31 and we both have a couple of health issues, but we both just really love life without kids.\n\nIt's just such a relief to be on the same page and not have to worry about. \n\nNeither of us have siblings (I have a half brother I haven't spoken to in nearly 20 years so I don't count him) and the idea of pregnancy just grosses me out quite a bit.\n\nWhat are some fundamental belief you felt a relief over with your SO?",

I only ask because my exhusband gave me the same story about not wanting kids, till my birth control failed 10 years later.  My son is now 18 about to 19.  He insisted it was meant to be and how complete our family would be, yep he talked me into it.  Then his mom died and he literally lost his mind.  I raised my son 17 years by myself.  Glad to have done it, love him with my whole heart but this was not the path I had chosen for myself.  So is he getting a vasectomy?  Mine is a cautionary tale, I was on birth control and used condoms because I was so afraid of getting pregnant.  I remember the night so clearly, the condom broke and I ran to the bathroom to use the potty to \u201cget it out\u201d crying absolutely terrified.  I was right to be scared as that is when I got pregnant.  Please ensure y\u2019all don\u2019t go thru what I did.  Stay on your path of happiness.",

Meanwhile, my friends who wanted kids had the opposite experience. It was so goofy! Unfortunately, our tastes were too different to just swap dates and see if we clicked... Of course. Isn't that the way of the world? \n\nWe were also on the same page about marriage, which is even harder to find. Both of us are against it but we did wind up marrying for entirely (and excellent) financial reasons after decades together, and that move was made in lockstep and via pragmatic discussion, not a proposal. He just fits my style in everything. \n\nIsn't it amazing when you start checking off the marks that matter most? It feels so much more worth the investment of time and effort. Because it is! Incompatibilities on kids are an impossible obstacle.",

I grew up in the baptist church and have very strong opinions on the matter of needing a faith. Totally unpopular opinion most of the time so I\u2019m always super relieved to get home to my husband who gladly joins in any vents I\u2019m having in regards to it. I still have family matters based around church stuff so it can crop up. I\u2019d *hate* to have to respect his feelings on this topic, I feel very strongly about it. \n\nAlso, as a mum of two and a daughter of one messed up mum, thanks for really thinking through the whole parenthood thing. You have my unwavering support on the matter. :)",

            "body": "When my husband and I started dating, there was initially a bit of friction over kids. I come from an abusive family, so I'd thought about it quite a lot and had decided that *if* I ever become a parent, it would be through adoption. DH comes from an amazing family and at that point in his life (18) he had never really thought about it and just kind of assumed that his life would go college, job, marriage, house, two biological children. But he decided that I mattered more to him than having bio kids mattered to him, so we stuck it out. Now that we're in our mid 30s, it's kind of reversed: I really want to start the adoption process, but he's not even sure he wants that much anymore. \n\nI'm not complaining. What really matters to me is that we both think through whether or not we are 100% committed to being parents before we start the process. I grew up with parents who were only committed to parenting when it suited them, and it left me with damage that I will be dealing with for the rest of my life. Whether I have kids or not, the cycle ends with me. And once my husband understood that, it was a huge relief.",
