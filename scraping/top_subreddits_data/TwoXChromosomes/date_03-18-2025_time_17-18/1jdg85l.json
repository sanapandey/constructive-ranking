    "selftext": "TLDR: This weekend I went to get my oil changed and found out that the car I bought in 2021 was not put in my name in Subaru\u2019s system. This means that if there are any problems with the car that require a warranty to be used I won\u2019t be able to use the warranty. \n\nSome background: In 2020 I went with my then boyfriend (now ex husband) to buy two cars. I bought both my car and his cash. This was during the shortages so we customized our cars on the app and ordered them from the factory through the dealership. It took 8 months for the cars to come and I paid cash for both cars. When the dealership guy asked us whose name to put on the titles I was very explicit that my car would have my name only and his car would have his name only. We signed all the paperwork and left with the cars. \n\nFast forward to now, my ex and I are no longer together and he kept his car and I kept mine in the divorce. I needed to get some things fixed on my car so I had to take it to a different dealership. (I no longer live anywhere near where I bought the car.) When I came in to pick up the car, the service center guy said how nice my car was and that he loved all the things the original owner added to it. I was confused and responded that I was the original owner. He explained that in his system I\u2019m not listed anywhere and then said my ex\u2019s name was listed as the owner of the car. He also explained that any warranties for the battery or interior wouldn\u2019t work if I tried to bring it in because I\u2019m not listed. He was very nice and gave me the number to call to fix it. I\u2019ve been fuming since Saturday about this. My ex wasn\u2019t part of the transaction for my car at all. There was no reason for his name to be put on anything relating to my vehicle especially because he was just my boyfriend at the time. \n\nNow I\u2019m waiting for Subaru to get back to me after I sent them the title and registration for my car so they can fix their fuck up. \n\nAs a warning to people, please double check EVERYTHING when buying a car.

When my still living mother transferred the title, she was adamant about using my *and* my husband's names. Only reason she could give me was \"in case something happens,\" which was really just a poorly veiled way of saying she's a misogynist who doesn't believe women should own things like cars on their own. We're married. In case something happens, it defaults to him since we're married! You know whose car is only in her name since she's a widow? Yeah, hers (come to think of it, even when he was alive I don't think it was joint.) You know what she also didn't mention? That my husband should put his leased car in both our names. Oh, no, that's not important. But the car I *own* needs to be shared.\u00a0\n\n\nSo that's not what happened, after many fights. I hate that my mother is an open misogynist (I mean she also just likes me less than everyone else and isn't shy about this) but it tracks with everything else she does/believes in.\u00a0\n\n\nI hope you get your issue fixed.\u00a0",

No matter what it was\u2014a warranty repair, an oil change, all of it, they would get a hold of him and call him about it.  \n\nWe finally found out why.  \n\nI was furious that they had elected to call him at work rather than me when I was listed as waiting on the service and sitting in their service area.  So I hammered the service tech and escalated and all that good stuff. \n\nCarmax lets people co-sign for the financial but their service and inner computer systems only have one name space available and usually when it\u2019s transferred and records created, they take the first name on the documents.  It can be 100% co owned with two people or more but they \u201conly have room for one\u201d in the computers.\n\nNow I don\u2019t have any doubt that there are ugly people everywhere but I did luck out and buy my Subaru from a lady who made sure that I was the only one signing the important bits and that I was the only one in their service system. \n\nSome of this is sexism and some of it is incompetence in their computer design.  Which *sigh* is likely more sexism hard at work.",

            "body": "You need to contact the dealership where you bought the car and ask them for a copy of the Buyer's Order. That's the paper that you signed when you bought the car, and they should still have it on file at the dealership if you didn't keep your copy. \n\nThe Buyer's Order is a form that is filled out with your name and contact info at the top, then it lists the price breakdown for the car, taxes, add-ons, etc. And then you sign it at the bottom of the page. (Search in Google Images for \"vehicle buyer's order\" to see what it's supposed to look like.)\n\nWhen you signed it, they would have asked you to verify the information filled in at the top was correct. Even if they didn't ask you to check, you absolutely would have noticed that your husband's name was at the top as it's only a one-page form. So it is very likely that the Buyer's Order correctly has your name at the top, and when they entered it into the computer, that's when they assigned your husband's name to the car.\n\nThis is the important part: >>> The buyer's order is the legal contract to buy the car, so if that has your name, that will override whatever they put in their computer, and that is your proof that you are the original owner.\n\nJust contact the original dealership, they should be able to email you the Buyer's Order if you can't go there in person.",

They kept asking us if we were sure we didn\u2019t want to include his name on the title despite me repeatedly saying I was the one buying the car, not him.  \n\nThen about a month later the dealership called me and asked for Mr. My Last Name.  There is no Mr. My Last Name so I was a little confused.  I asked them who they were looking to speak to since I wasn\u2019t sure who Mr. My Last Name was and they just repeated Mr. My Last Name.  I asked what he was calling for and he said it was regarding the Ford Bronco that was just purchased.  I said I was the one the purchased it and asked if they had the owner\u2019s name listed.  I have an obviously female name.  He said yes, he had my First and Last Name listed as the owner.  I then asked if he knew what the name of the owner was why he was asking for a Mr. Last Name when the owner was obviously female.  He then told me he was looking to speak to my husband since it was about the car.  I explained to him like he was a toddler that women have jobs nowadays and can buy their own cars without a man.",

Hopefully they were just decent people, but regardless I was thankful not to deal with shit like OP here did.",
