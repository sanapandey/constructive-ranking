We expect our users to adhere to the rules set in place, so as a reminder\u2026\n\n#Trans Women are Women.\n\nWe will ***not*** have any transphobia or TERFs in this sub.\n\nAlso keep in mind micro aggressions and casual bigotry. You may not intend to exclude trans peoples or to cause dysphoria, but it can and does happen. \n\nAny transphobia will be met with a permanent ban. End of story. ",
