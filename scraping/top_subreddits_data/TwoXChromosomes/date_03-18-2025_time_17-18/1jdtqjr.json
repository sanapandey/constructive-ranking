    "selftext": "\"Wearing glasses was like having a broken arm\u2014an impairment so glaring that trying to distract from it or compensate for it seemed pointless and silly\" \n\nI have huge self esteem issues around wearing my glasses, and I read this article today and I cant stop thinking about it. Its about this woman who finally feels pretty in her mid 30's after getting eye surgery. \n\n\"Glasses had not only obscured these imperfections with the blunt force of black plastic but had made \u201cfixing\u201d them irrelevant. Now, for the first time, my face seems worth improving.\" \n\nIm not sure if im just projecting, and Im happy for this woman, but honestly I wish this entire \"glasses are ugly\" narrative dies. Im sick of it and its wrecking my self-esteem. ",

People think there's something wrong with glasses then that's a 'them' problem.\n\n  \nI'd also go out on a limb and suggest that you did not read an article, rather you read some advertainment that's designed to target the core of your insecurities in order to get you to buy.\n\nStop giving a fuck and these things lose their power also.\n\nFind some glasses that make you feel gorgeous and own that shit.\n\n  \nThanks for listening to my TED talk",

I can't even see the blur of the letter now. Surgical eye correction is not possible with the current level of tech. My eyes are too bad. It's weird because I hated my glasses and then as my eyes continue to get worse and worse over the decades I can only weird certain kinds of glasses frames (because the expensive lenses can't be supported and protected unless they're a certain shape) and then I kind of regretted not being able to wear some of the glasses frames I could before.\n\nThese days I wear contacts because I get fewer distortions and light refractions than I do with the really thick glasses lenses. The frames are now quite heavy and chafe and rub. But I have occasionally broken out some no-prescription fashion frames just for fun while wearing contacts. I think there was something healing in it not being a necessity to compensate for a health condition and just something I could wear or not by choice. It kind of helped me reframe (pun intended) the way I felt about it.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't take these articles seriously. They're in it for the money. If everyone felt confident about themselves, then their readership wouldn't feel like they needed their opinion and they wouldn't sell.",

My glasses were cute, I like pictures from before, but three years ago I did clear lens exchange  (CLE).  It's not shaving your cornea like lasik,  my eyes were thin for that.  It's grandma's cataract surgery, with prescription lenses.  I got both distance and reading vision fixed.  Life changing, after 40+ years of wearing glasses.  No fogging, sports are better, I can see the.alarm clock in the middle of the night, no anxiety about losing or breaking my glasses and being functionally blind.   If you have funds, I highly recommend. Bonus, I'll never develop cataracts",

They probably won't even think twice about them, unless they admire how good they look on you. I hated wearing glasses when I first got them when I was a kid but these days I think I look better with them. Sure they get in the way at times and are annoying to clean. They're also more expensive as I age and need different glasses for different purposes but i try to pick fun ones that compliment my face and have fun with having poor vision. Many people really look good with glasses once they find ones that suit them.",

Some \"guys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses\" shit. In my life, glasses have never been embarrassing, it's just something most people need. I got LASIK not because I was ashamed of wearing glasses, but because my eyes were so bad, in case of an emergency or the catastrophic collapse of society would leave me heavily handicapped to the point of uselessness. I'm back to needing slight correction, and basically only wear something if I'm seeing a show or know I'm going to want to see detail from a distance. I wore contacts for many years because I wanted to wear sunglasses and my active lifestyle made glasses less practical. I needed to be able to swim laps and see the clock, lifeguard with sunglasses and see children, play sports and use power tools without something in the way. \n\nI'm guessing you just haven't found a style that suits you. For decades I had thicker framed, dark plastic rectangles. I was an emo millennial after all. Now I have some very retro 1960s nerd style ones my mom teased me about because they look like her father's, but I think they look good on me. I actually think glasses can enhance appearance, and I have about 2 dozen pairs of sunglasses that attest to that. \n\nI've never had a partner anything other than excited when they discovered I wore glasses. My husband was a little sad when I got LASIK because he liked my frames so much.",

Lots of people look great in glasses. If getting LASIK will make you more confident, there are a lot of great reasons to go with it, but don't do it because a fashion magazine says they are ugly. In a couple months a different writer for the same magazine will write about how good glasses look in an attempt to sell them as fashion accessories to people who don't need them.",
