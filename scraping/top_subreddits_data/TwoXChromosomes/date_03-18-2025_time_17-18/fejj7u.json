Women, men, nonbinary, agender, genderqueer, cis folks and trans folks, *everybody*. If you're not on board with that, you can fuck right off.\n\n#But what about the subreddit name? \n \n##[Read this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9283g/addressing_the_genetics_issue_you_dont_have_to_be/) from when 2XC was only a month old. We haven't changed our stance since then, and never will.\n\n#What about trans women?  \n\n##Trans women are women. TERFS can fuck right off. \n\n#What are the rules, anyway?  \n\n##TL;DR: Keep it civil, keep it relevant. Don't start shit, won't be shit.  \n##You can find the rules in the sidebar (community info for mobile users), or here's a direct link:  [2XC Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/rules#Rules)   \n\n####Most moderator actions are the result of users breaking Rule 1: RESPECT. If you keep Wheaton's Law* in mind and participate in good faith, you'll probably never hear from the mod team.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n ^*Wheaton's ^Law: ^Don't ^be ^a ^dick.\n\n\n-----\n\n###For more in-depth interpretations of the rules above, see the [2XC FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/faq) and [2XC Moderation Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/moderationpolicy).\n\n-----\n\n#Wow that's awesome!
