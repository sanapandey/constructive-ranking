    "selftext": "I\u2019m 39/f in the US and just had my 10 day post op appointment after getting my fallopian tubes removed. Here\u2019s my thoughts. \n\nFirst of all everyone should know that female sterilization is covered under the Affordable Care Act and my surgery was 100% covered by insurance as part of \u201cfamily planning.\u201d I got it done as soon as I could because I didn\u2019t know how long the ACA was going to be around. Dealing with insurance though was an absolute nightmare. \n\nActual surgery was laparoscopic, 3 small incisions and took 45 minutes. Only had to take pain meds that first day. After that pretty low pain, just a little discomfort. I was up and at it right after surgery. I\u2019m amazed by the dissolvable internal stitches. Worst part was the bloat from my abdomen being inflated. Took almost a full week to dissipate. It looked like I was 4 months pregnant. 10 days out and I got the go ahead to lift all restrictions. \n\nBasically, it was easier than expected and I feel a sense of relief, like I have a little more control over my body. I would 100% do it again! \n",

There are hurdles:\n\n- insurance companies can choose which procedure(s) they cover. OP had a bilateral salpingectomy, aka bisalp, which is quickly becoming standard. Ligation is more commonly covered.\n\n- contact your insurance to verify what is covered. Try to get their response in writing.\n\n- ALL providers and facilities must be in network. You can fight to have exceptions, but it\u2019s exponentially easier to ensure things are in network.\n\n- insurance companies are sneaky. Mine had only a Catholic hospital in network, and the hospital itself didn\u2019t permit the procedure. I was fortunate to find a better insurance policy at open enrollment.\n\n- they will almost certainly try to get money from you: surgical fees, facility fees, anesthesia, etc. Do not give money - tell them to bill your insurance. Open claims if your insurance fights you. Fight back.\n\n- CoverHer.org is an excellent resource. There\u2019s a list of *vetted* doctors over at r/childfree.",

Quite literally yesterday I received a letter from a collections company that this had been sent to collections. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I have never had anything go to collections before.

Those of us with a family history of endometriosis can also benefit from having them removed.\n\nNot to mention, ligations can be reversed... and can accidentally be done in a way that they're not effective.
