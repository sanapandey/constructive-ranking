    "selftext": "This should have happened years ago, but the too patient person I am, waited for him to come to this conclusion. \n35F / 35M \n\nWe only did 2 sessions of the couples therapy that I had to beg him to agree to, and then he finally said weeks later he doesn't want to keep doing therapy, and he doesn't want to change how he is. He doesn't want to talk about his feelings, he doesn't want to know why he's the way he is or how to make it better. I'm so disappointed that he won't even put in any effort in making us better when I have sacrificed so much of my wants and needs to keep holding on.\n\n He just wants a platonic roommate. He said it wasn't fair that I say he doesn't help w chores bc 90% of the stuff and mess in the house is mine, and that he cleans his own messes and does his own laundry. Maybe I'm messy because I'm doing the bulk of the mental and physical load of our relationship. He's never once cooked for me or got me a present that wasn't already preselected on a list. \n\nAll of that plus his reluctance to have a fucking sex life. The thought of him being with someone else that way infuriates me when he hasn't touched me in years. \n\nHe knows he'll never be the man I want him to be. Why did it have to take so long? I'm only thankful that we aren't married (he didn't want to get married) or have kids (he doesn't want kids). We share a house and a dog that I am keeping. As hard as this is hitting me now, I have a fresh start ahead of me.",

You deserve to have a person who can help you sort out how you got here and *why you needed him to say this out loud before you believed it.* \n\nIt's been 10 years of you giving excuses for the way he is. This is who he's been the whole time. You've just been hoping he'll be the best version of himself for you. A good therapist can help you get to the root of why you accepted this for yourself. They can help you treat yourself with the love and kindness that you deserve. \n\nI hope your days keep getting easier. \ud83e\udec2\ud83e\ude77 You should be incredibly proud of how much work you've done to get to this point. You from 5 years ago would be shocked at how much you've grown!",

Behavior is a language and based on your post, his behavior has been telling you for years he wasn't going to change. That he only cared about the things you did for him and not about you as person. And yet, you refused to believe it. If he hadn't just admitted that he wasn't going to change, would you still be with him, hoping this time things were going to be different.",
