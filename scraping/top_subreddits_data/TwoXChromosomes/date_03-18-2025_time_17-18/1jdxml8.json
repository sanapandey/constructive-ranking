We're fucked either way.\"\n\nI try to be the one that uplifts people, and the voice of reason. I'm very good at persuading others to look at the bright side. But I can't see it right now. \n\nI saw so many people mock Greta Thunberg while she screamed at the top of her lungs to rally people up and stand for the planet, and now I can't help but think her youth was wasted on a lost cause. \n\nThe worrisome part is that I can't get away from the news cycle because that's my line of work. So we weather a shitstorm every day, and as much as I paint and listen to music and try to keep it together after hours, a bunch of forks got me down in the pits. \n\nIs it all lost? Does it even matter?\n\nAnyway. I got the regular ones because the compostable ones can't stand any kind of heat before warping like the T-1000 in Terminator. ",

Recycling and composting are the least effective part of the pyramid but it's stressed that it's you're personal responsibility. Only a percentage of a percentage of the stuff you send for recycling actually gets recycled. The rest just gets to take a little ride before it ends up in the same landfill. \n\nPersonal responsibility is bunk, it's not going to off set large scale business and government malfeasance. That's the spin they're selling us. Pledge not to dump thousands of gallons of chemicals in the ocean or use your private jet to go across state to get In-N-Out. There, you are absolved from the fork dilemma.\n\nDo something practical and tangible to help your community and the people you love. Take the time to rest and take care of your health. It is very logical to be sad, I am sad with you. I hope you can find some peace in these times.",

They don't want you to think that they do because that knowledge can lead to their downfall.  \n\nThey need money. If we starve the oligarchs then they can shrink to a more manageable size. Most of their net worth  isn't liquid assets and their worth is in investments, including stock in their own companies.  \nPrivate jets and estates and yachts aren't cheap.

I don't cook it at home and have only eaten it a few times I the past 9 months or so. I chose to eat less beef because I heard that it's one of the biggest effects one individual can make aside from stopping driving, which isn't an option for me. I still eat chicken, pork, seafood and mutton. To me it makes sense to start with small changes. Cows take the longest to get to harvest age and are (one of) the largest animals we farm. So we must be spending a ton of resources on that meat. I also try to incorporate other sources of protein like tofu, chick peas, and alternative meat. And it makes me feel a little better about driving, and all the single use plastics I use at my job in the hospital and other ways I am privileged and wasteful throughout my life",
