    "selftext": "So today at work, my new boss asked me why I left my previous IT project. I was honest and told him it was due to gender-based discrimination. His response? He told me he could *totally* relate because he once experienced people trusting men with long beards more than him.\n\n...Seriously?\n\nThis man really thought his *beard struggle* was equivalent to the systemic, dehumanizing experience of being a woman in tech. Like, dude, nobody doubted your intelligence, dismissed your ideas, or talked over you *because of your gender.* You weren\u2019t paid less, excluded from networking opportunities, or treated as less competent from day one.\n\nIt\u2019s wild how some men will reach for the *most* surface-level, irrelevant comparison just to center themselves in a conversation that isn\u2019t about them. And I bet he walked away thinking he was being *progressive* by \"relating\" to my experience instead of just\u2026listening.\n\nI swear, the bar is on the floor.",

Especially in the tech field, I\u2019ve seen so many women who have had to fight to be taken seriously and this man is out here comparing it to his beard and feeling so proud about being a progressive male. \n\nReminds me a little of the professor who tried to relate to me when I was struggling in school because I was 8 months pregnant, going through a break-up, and dealing with his instruction, which was legitimately the worst classroom experience I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nOne day after class he hit me with \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through.\u201d No, sir, I am 100% sure you do not. \ud83e\udd23",

Juggling all of that while dealing with all the bs? You\u2019re incredible for pushing through, and I hope you had people around you who actually supported you <3",

I feel like while women also make this misstep, on average men seem to be exceptionally unaware, and I have to attribute this to a system that just makes everything easier for them. There was a kid who did a slam poetry thing at his school one time addressing his cis white male privilege and I think about that a lot.\n\nAnd yeah, I made it through. \u2764\ufe0f That was 20 years ago, I now have a kind-hearted 20 year old daughter as well as a 16-year-old son and a wonderful husband of 16 years.

Like, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he thought he was saying the nice, empathetic thing, but if he'd just stopped for a beat, he might have chosen his words better. Then again, if his instruction was that bad, he probably wouldn't have had the self awareness.\n\nI've actually worked to remove that phrase from my empathy bag. Sometimes I can know what someone is going through sort of, but I'll have never had the same lived experiences. I prefer, \"I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds painful.\" It's more accurate and less foot-in-mouth.",

Also his instruction felt designed to make people fail. He had a significant stutter, which was fine, except that he gave us absolutely no materials to which we could refer\u2014no textbook, no handout, no worksheet\u2014so literally all of the information had to come from his hour-and-a-half long lecture in which he listed many legal cases and precedents and names and dates. It would have been hard to keep track of on the best of days, and I was not having the best of days! \ud83d\ude05",
