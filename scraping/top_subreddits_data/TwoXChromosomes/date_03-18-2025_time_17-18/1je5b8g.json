    "selftext": "I'm not sure how much the details really matter here. This was our second date, he hadn't even attempted to kiss me after our first date. We had absolutely hit it off, both dates continued for hours after dinner because we just enjoyed sitting there talking & getting to know each other. He walked me to my car, hugged me good night, then went in for a kiss while he's arms were still wrapped around me. I wanted to kiss him too. Within seconds he become very forceful, pushing me against my car and putting his hand around my neck. He continued trying to make out with me, but I definitely wasn't participating. He tried choking me harder before he recognized how freaked out I was. He apologized and blamed having one to many beers, saying he had just gotten ahead of himself. I was basically in an auto pilot mode, being polite and agreeable until I was finally alone in my car where I bursted into tears.\n\nThis was a couple of days ago. My neck isn't bruised, but there is some discoloration and broken blood vessels. My concern at this point isn't really about him, or men at all. I'm just so disappointed in how I responded to the situation. I've experienced various assaults and types of harassment, and every time I'm suppose to have a fight or flight response, my body freezes up. My mind will be screaming, but I'll smile and say anything I have to until it feels safe to exit a situation. I'm sure there are various explanations for this type of response, but I'm left feeling completely betrayed by my body. I've put so much effort into learning how to respond differently and sometimes it feels like I've made progress, but then a situation like this shows me that I'm still exactly where I started. I suppose I'm mostly writing just to vent, but I'm curious if other women have the same type of response, and if they were able to accept it about themselves & turn it into a strength or if they were able to overcome it & really learn to stand their ground.

Your base programming is taking over, and that's really hard to override in situations where you aren't in danger; when you are, it can be nearly impossible, at least in the moment.\n\nMy understanding is there are things you can do that could impact your reaction in a similar situation in the future, such as training/building confidence in self-defense skills. But when the brain thinks it's in danger, it will do what it thinks is most likely to lead to a positive outcome, and sometimes without prior consultation with the conscious part of you.\n\nI absolutely get feeling disappointed or helpless - I think that's a really understandable reaction; feeling like I'm not in control of myself is probably the most distressing experience possible for me personally. I'm glad you're safe now, and I'm really sorry this happened to you. Hopefully these feelings fade a bit with time, but if it starts feeling really difficult to accept/understand/reframe/overcome/etc it, I think that's the kind of thing that could really benefit from talking with a therapist or someone similar, if that's something that's accessible to you.",

They\u2019re most commonly used for healing trauma. If a person has experienced trauma in the past and is triggered in the present, the map of how they experience the world has been redrawn by that trauma which can undermine their ability to choose differently in the present.\n\nWhen it comes to feeling safe in these physically threatening situations IRL, I think physically practicing things ahead of time is what makes the difference. \n\nI participated in a women\u2019s self-defense class about a year ago, and what really struck me was during our first session we had to practice establishing and holding a boundary. Even saying \u201cno\u201d to our male performers (pretending the be a perpetrator), the majority of the class struggled with that! Many women would say the word quietly or without confidence (\u201cno\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026no?\u201d), or when holding the boundary would request compliance. Over using \u201cplease\u201d or apologizing excessively, undermining what we wanted to communicate with our hesitant body language, etc. It was habitual.\n\nBut by the end of those four sessions, we didn\u2019t need as much conscious thought in the moment; we had trained for this. And now we had a new habit. \n\n\u201cI am not interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease back up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO.\u201d\n\nAnd that day, when our gracious volunteers disregarded our boundaries, we automatically reacted\u2014 eye strike, groin slap, elbow (whatever mix we could instinctively match to our attacker) evaluate surroundings, clear to flee and RUN. \n\nSo try not to be too hard on yourself, OP. Thinking about it differently is great, but your body needs to live it to believe it\u2019s a safe option. Give yourself some opportunities for safe practice, and build that  habit until you can feel that confidence viscerally in your bones. \n\nOh, and also: fuck that guy. Jesus Christ.",

It is anything but, even when done consensually and with adequate knowledge of human anatomy.   Choking - even a little - cause brain damage. Full stop.  Habitual or severe choking causes strokes. \n\nThis is why sex ed matters; when we allowed porn to replace sex ed, young men started assuming it was documentary - not fantasy.  They copy what they see modeled, and assume that\u2019s just how it\u2019s done. \n\nAnd what\u2019s worse is that because porn never shows the \u201cadvance verbal consent\u201d part, men assume this is something that is normal enough to surprise a partner without discussing in advance. \n\nPorn normalized this behavior very recently into the mainstream. It\u2019s only been common now in porn for about 15 years now.  The first time I saw it, I was shocked because of the casualness of the violence in what was otherwise a very typical x-rated clip.  It was like seeing an arm-wrestling match where someone pulled out a set of brass knuckles and punched their opponent.   Within a handful of years, it was everywhere.  \n\nAnd it really (IMHO) reveals how misogyny is present in porn because I have never once seen a woman choke her male partner.  \n\nIt used to be an extremely fringe practice because knowledgeable people in the BDSM community long ago discovered it\u2019s a fucking risky thing to do.",

Obviously your priority should be to not add another bad experience to the list. But if you think you can handle a stupid police officer not taking you seriously or sth like that please go and make a report. You deserve some justice.\n\nAnd your reaction was completely justified and normal and this man can go fuck himself. He is a major asshole and dangerous. What he meant was: normally I would wait with the strangling until we are alone and you are completely helpless in bed and it is my fetish, the beer prompted me not to wait. That was not an apology. It was an explanation.\n\nYou did right to protect yourself and that was in your case to not escalate. You don\u2019t know what could have happened and that is scary. You were right and he was wrong.\n\nEdit: about the learning to overcome the fawn-response. I did. I got bigger. Fat to be exact. I bought a very heavy leather jacket and filled it with metal patches. It changed how I walked. It gave me a general feeling of self confidence and protection (helps that it is a padded jacket with Kevlar lining so it really protects from attacks). At first I just talked back to cat callers and told them off. Then I realised I got more aggressive when people crossed my boundaries. I learned to scream No in a very aggressive way. Then I fought off a guy at a party who was too touchy. That was when I realised my response had changed. Now I don\u2019t need the jacket anymore. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t change that fawning can be reasonable too. Sometimes it\u2019s not the best idea to fight. And to train that away is to accept the consequences. It\u2019s not that I now have more choice over my adrenaline response. It just changed to aggression. But it\u2019s a fact that \u201ethose\u201c guys often go after women they deem as helpless or alone. To seem strong and confident can go a long way. Better it never comes down to testing it.",

And the porn industry feeds language into the social media ecosystem in order to normalize violence against women (like for example \u201cchoking\u201d vs what it is: strangulation), and to protect violence against women by making the women who don\u2019t want to be strangled - who to be clear are the VICTIMS) into villains (and the stranglers into victims) because if they move to protect themselves (and maybe save their own lives), they\u2019re \u201ckink shaming\u201d. \u00a0It\u2019s classic DARVO abuse, in this case designed to teach women that in order to keep a man around you have to convince yourself that you like being strangled, and if you don\u2019t you have to fake it in order to protect him from discomfort, while he\u2019s cutting off your airways.

I didn't say anything to indicate that that was okay for him to do and I also wasn't wearing a super revealing top. Not that a revealing top is any kind of invitation.\n\nI froze in that moment and put my hands over my chest so he couldn't go any further. I was super polite and informed him that I needed to leave as it was getting late and I had work in the morning, which was a total lie. I got in my car and left.\n\nWhen I look back at the situation, I sometimes feel like crap about myself because I am a very loud, strong-minded, opinionated person who doesn't let other people push them around. But in that moment I froze instead of standing up for myself. But when I really stop to think about it, I realized that it's a natural reaction and likely one that protected me from further assault.",
