I can\u2019t keep pretending like he doesn\u2019t matter to me at all. All this while he\u2019s out and about having fun with chicks. Fuck all this  but I\u2019m really sad. So need some comfort from internet strangers rn. Have you ever cut off a man you really liked? Does the pain ease with time? ",

Am I correct in assuming that he either doesn't know you like him or that you've made a move of some kind and he told you he wasn't interested? I think the context can matter sometimes. A lot of romantic interests I met were people I got along great with, but a friendship just wasn't in the cards and we ended up parting ways when one or both realized it wasn't going to work out beyond a simple friendship.",

He probably did all this because he wanted to get closer to get information so he can justify his hate. \n\nSuch an awful person and it hurt me. And the funny part he acts so kind and nice to other women, to other friends of his. Why was I not deserving of that\u2026.",

Just try to save yourself from more heartache and do what you know will be best for you in the long run!",

He used to neg me and make me feel as though I\u2019m not as pretty without makeup or would find flaws in me and compare to me to his talking stages or other women in his life unprovoked. At the time I was naive and thought maybe this is his way of opening up to me but I slowly realised he actually just hated me. So I distanced myself and ghosted him (he reached out a lot of times) but I guess now he\u2019s moved on for good. \n\nStill it hurts seeing him celebrate or congratulate others when he couldn\u2019t even do that for me. He\u2019s nice to other women but rude when it comes to me. But at one point we were really close and I guess letting go of that hurts. Anyways this is me being sentimental and stupid but I did care about him a lot. Sucks to know that there was secret animosity from his side",

It can help to focus first on feeling the hurt and anger from their mistreatment or carelessness first, as then that will help you have necessary backbone to stay no contact with them when you then go on to feel and process missing them, & the grief from losing the connection.",
