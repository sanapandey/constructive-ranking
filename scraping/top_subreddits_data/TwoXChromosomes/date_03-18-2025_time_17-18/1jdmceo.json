    "selftext": "  So one of my male friends was venting to me about how they had a talking stage with two girls and it didn\u2019t pan out because one of his potential suitors was looking for something serious. He then said to me that \u201cShe reminds me of you. You can never just vibe and be casual with someone. You only see someone if it\u2019s something serious.\u201dI basically said to him that there\u2019s nothing wrong with someone wanting something serious. It\u2019s nothing wrong if someone desires something casual. Y\u2019all just want different things but she\u2019s not wrong for mentioning what she wants . He then started laughing and then he made comments about how he\u2019s done with \u201cb****\u201d and other offensive comments about her being a single mother. Now there\u2019s nothing wrong with hooking up with someone you\u2019re not with or casual sex but it\u2019s not for me. This also isn\u2019t the first time a friend has made fun of me bc I\u2019m not a hookup person. Understandable it\u2019s normal in my early 20s but it\u2019s so annoying when people make fun of me for this.\n\nEdit: We are not friends anymore and Im ghosting him. I made this post when this situation was fresh so I wasn\u2019t politically correct my bad. Obviously he\u2019s not a friend so please don\u2019t assume I\u2019m still friends bc those comments are annoying me. Thanks. Also I already was in the process of ghosting him when I made this post. I don\u2019t like how people are assuming I was going to continue the friendship when I wrote this fresh when the situation was happening and I was processing everything. Any comments that says I only considered ending the friendship bc of these comments I\u2019ll block you . ",

Next time - think about just owning it unapologetically and saying something like: \"yes - that's me exactly - I know I don't want to waste any time if it's not potentially serious\". You don't have to tell him there's nothing wrong with that. You don't have to plead your case. It is what it is and you want what you want.\n\nIt sounds like he's the one that needs to just tell women upfront that he only wants something casual.",

But he really shouldn't shit on people for knowing what they want already.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso note, he's putting down this lady to you, in an effort to chastise you. Like making you feel ashamed for thinking in a similar vein.\u00a0\n\n\nAs if making fun of her would suddenly make you want to flip your lifestyle on its head and prove you were \"cool' and suddenly decide to sleep with him.\u00a0\n\n\nAgain, maybe he'll grow up. But if this poor attempt at reverse psychology is all he's got. Eh. Not sleeping with him was the right call for that other girl. (And I know it was her call vs his haha -probably another part of whats got him all butt hurt).\u00a0\n\n\nHopefully all other girls who have and want a mature relationship vs a fling suss him out as well.\u00a0",
