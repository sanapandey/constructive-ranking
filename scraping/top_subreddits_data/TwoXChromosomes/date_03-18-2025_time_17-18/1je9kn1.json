He has a show called \"Financial Audit\" where he helps people with their finances.  He is a very \"Gordon Ramsey\" style Youtuber.  He shouts and pounds his hands on the table in a comical way, but the advice he give is very good.  Especially if you are needing help with your finances.\n\nThis particular video is not funny.  And sadly it is all too common.  This poor woman is stuck, with a child, in a financially abusive relationship.  And this husband DOES NOT GIVE A SHIT.  Thank goodness she does have a job, but she knows she can't leave him in her financial situation.\n\nMy mother always said \"Never marry for money or because you think it is your last chance.\"  She has said that everyone she knows that got married for those reasons, is now divorced.\n\nIf your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, that is amazing.  But always make sure you have education and job skills to fall back on.  You never know what is going to happen!  Even if your spouse isn't a giant gaping asshole, people die unexpectedly.  If you don't have skills or a degree to support yourself, you can end up in a situation like this woman above. \n\nYoung women, married women, single women, trans women, you deserve for you partner to support you not hold you down.  And if you don't find someone who supports you, then you get out.  Those people will do nothing but drag you down.  ",

He doesn't care that he spends all their money \\*and\\* ran up the credit cards, because \"money is coming in next week\".\n\nHe also says, \"I pay for her house\" because he works away from home, and is rarely there.  So, he doesn't really think of their kid as his responsibility in any way.  He's not there for weeks at a time.\n\nI love that Caleb snaps, \"get your wife a fucking tissue!\".  The wife is crying over their debt, and the husband is refusing to do anything.",

He refuses to think about money beyond \"next week\", and he also is dealing with his emotional pain by spending freely, and telling himself that \"he works hard\" so he deserves it.  \n\nAnd I might have felt some sympathy if he didn't keep lying and lying and lying to her.\n\nI hope she has a big life insurance policy on him, because he is going to leave her in a mountain of debt.",
