    "selftext": "I am the only woman on a male-dominated team. I work closely with my coworker, although we are both remote. One day, on a call with one other person, I asked him if he had completed a task that affected both our projects. He said no, and I said no problem, I\u2019ll take care of it because I want to see if it has significant impact. I said all of this in a friendly tone, completely harmless. \n\nWell, somehow he took this as a slight, as me trying to embarrass him in front of this person. That was *light years* away from what it actually was and what my intention was. But he took it so poorly that he then got all of his buddies, who are offshore workers just like him, to basically dogpile me. \n\nThey all came at me in our weekly meeting, picking apart my work, finding fault with things that have never been an issue in the past, accusing me of not doing things that they know aren\u2019t even in my area. They were speaking to me like they hated me. It was insane. I have never had that happen to me in my life. And it was scary, because I thought these guys supported me. \n\nHas this ever happened to you? ",

She just wasn't over the top about things and would say stuff like \"Please have this report done by the end of this week, thank you.\" instead of things like \"I know you're really busy and I hate to bother you, really sorry for existing btw, but there's a report I need done by the end of the week, it would be absolutely amazing if you do your job, thanks so much sorry again for having the audacity to ask you do to something!!!!\"",

Besides documenting and taking this to the way higher ups \u2013 perhaps citing cases of mobbing against women that turned out quite badly for companies, like the one shown in the movie North Country \u2013 you could also have a face to face talk with the dude. Very directly questioning him about sending the others to harass you, staying completely calm while he denies and attacks. Bet that would be fun.\n\nPlease give us updates on how this continues!

They will be on your team as long as it is productive to their end but they won't protect you and they will always take the opportunity to look better than you. Managers are simple creatures and will probably take what the men say at face value because the entire construct of society has given them the edge.
