    "selftext": "Petty, but God I see this phrase CONSTANTLY! \"Men have trouble dating, cause we are expected to be 6feet, provide, and-\", or even shit like \"If Men would just stop providing, women would lose their shit and-\", or any meme variation of \"When WW3 breaks out, women will happily stay home and play housewife, cause deep down, they expect men to be the main provider aka dead man walking\".\n\nDon't get me wrong: I know that society/societal norms are still behind the times, in many ways. Toxic gender roles suck. Men. Women. And they stick to anyone, aka there are likely enough women who do believe men should pay/work for everything. Either because they are traditional/religious...or y'know. \"I'm pretty and have no empathy, so I feel everyone has to prove their worth to me\" Mean Girls.\n\nThat said: I just can't help, but feel pissy. Growing up, I was always surrounded by working women. Working women from ANY group: From blue to white collar. In rural areas, farmers of both genders would work fields and animals, never mind carry heavy stuff and operate mashinery. And in academia/middle-class families, it was fairly normal that both parents worked. Very commonly in the same fields e.g doctor couples. Even as a kid, I was taught how important school/work was, because \"Yes. Men are nice. But if he dies or runs away -who cares for the kids? Yes, you can cry. But you can't feed your kids on tears.\" to quote my very traditional grandmother. ^((the \"die\" part refers to most of our men dying in wars -we're European))\n\nGetting older, this sentiment never changed. On dates, you pay together. And sure, as mentioned there were girls who bragged about their bfs spending money on them -but even that was never put into the same category as dating for love. More dating for status. And in that, it was often mutual: The girl got presents/free lunch, and the guy got to show off his hot gf. Which. To be a bit fair, has been a tactic of many women in the past ^((and present, depending on where you live)) as well. Women who wanted to work, but couldn't due to sexism, and so capitalized on their beauty. *\"Don't you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty? You wouldn't marry a girl just because she's pretty, but my goodness, doesn't it help?\"* \\-Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n\nAnd yes, yes. I know. I know. A lot is just insecure men being whiny. Men that want a power-structure and are angry they can't have women dependable on them anymore -not just on Reddit, but also, sadly in politics, media & co. Hence keeping the mill rolling, rolling.\n\nBut you know. Just. It's not just insulting to you, but also to all the people you love. Y'know?",

            "body": "Hah. If providing means having a job, most couples I know both work full time and have to in order to not live in near poverty. Yet somehow despite putting in equal hours in the office, the women seem to put in more in the home. Who is it that is pulling more than their fair share of the weight really? The issue seems to me to be that providing an income is the *only* expectation.\n\n>Growing up, I was always surrounded by working women.\n\nThis idea that women only started working recently is a type of historical revisionism that seems to be perpetuated by certain groups in order to manipulate angry, isolated and insecure men into participating in the manosphere or the political right. In reality the so-called traditional housewife was restricted to a very small part of history and to a few locations.\n\nOther attempts to change things I have noticed are erasure of violent protests, downplaying of women's contributions to the war efforts, downplaying of womens contributions to science and technology, pretending everyone used to marry extremely young girls and overplaying of the prevalence of \"women and children first\".",

Especially those Memes I've mentioned. Every time, it's this American 50s picture of a woman with a casserole. And despite knowing it better, my German ass just thinks \"When?! When tf did women ever act like that in war?\" Because in my head, the first idea of \"women in war\" are women in factories, in field hospitals, or scavengers looking for food in a bombed country.\n\nI guess it's why it makes me so angry. Yes. Men dying as soldiers is horrible. But then you have the horror that just the women in my family lived through. Like. I have a Polish aunt, who had to make her way through WW2 Germany with 7 kids. And how my family lifts her up as a small role model, because \"she kept all 7 alive, and only herself & her oldest daughter got raped\". Including hiding from Russian soldiers in cold cellars, as rats tried to eat her alive.\n\nOr, just my grandmother. Who used her starved body to press herself into small spaces to get food for her siblings. It fucked her up for life. Any visit, she'd make mountains of food. Get concerned if you didn't eat enthusiastically. One time, I even got my mother in trouble with her once: When I was 4-5yo, I was a pretty fussy, impulsive kid. That day, it was just before dinner, and I was constantly grabbing for the pot, not understanding it'd be done in literal 5-10min. At one point, my grandmother called. And with Ma busy in the kitchen, I got the phone first when she called.\n\n\"How are you honey?\", she asked. \"Not good.\" I said sobbing. \"I'm so hungry and Mama doesn't want to give me food.\" (Pause) \"...honey. Give me your mother, please?\"\n\nit took 5-10min of arguing till my mother convinced her of the miscommunication.",

We're talking serious. You don't want to end up with a loveless marriage, do you?\n\n>**Dorothy Shaw:** Me, loveless?\n\n>**Lorelei Lee**: That's right. Because, if a girl spends all of her time worrying about the money she doesn't have - how is she going have any time for being in love? I want you to find happiness and stop having fun.\n\nContext: \"stop having fun\" refers to Lorelei's criticism of Dorothy always chasing sporty guys with no money, as beauty is linked to time, and the women's main asset (catching the eye of a man in the crowd). Obviously, she wants her to have fun. But she also wants her to be SAFE financially. Especially since it's implied in a song that Dorothy was so poor, she never even got an education, and potentially can't even read/write. With secretary being the main form of job, city women could often have. So a man that loves her, AND provides with a good job would be mutually beneficial.\n\nA man who resents you though? That's worse in any case. I mean. Not only are you providing for another person alone, you're providing for a person that actively hates you. Maybe even sabotage you, in their own insecurity.",

Mothers ages 25 to 44 are less likely to be in the labor force than women of the same age who do not have children at home, and they tend to work fewer hours each week when employed. This can reduce the earnings of some mothers, although evidence suggests the effect is either modest overall or short-lived for many. On the other hand, fathers are more likely to be in the labor force \u2013 and to work more hours each week \u2013 than men without children at home. This is linked to an increase in the pay of fathers \u2013 a phenomenon referred to as the \u201cfatherhood wage premium\u201d \u2013 and tends to widen the gender pay gap.\u201d\n\n\u201cMotherhood does have important effects on the potential earnings of women. Women who experience breaks in their careers after becoming mothers sacrifice at least some of their earnings. Some mothers may never work for pay after having children, passing on earnings altogether. But it is difficult to know what the earnings of mothers might have been and, as a result, it is hard to know for certain what the full effect of motherhood is on women\u2019s earnings. Estimates suggest that motherhood may account for much of the current shortfall in the earnings potential of women overall.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/",

I don\u2019t think most women feel that way but I do think there\u2019s been a massive push traditional gender roles on social media and since it\u2019s coming from a POC woman (as opposed to a conservative white man), people don\u2019t see an issue with it.",

I confess, I even followed stuff like that for a while as a teen. I was anxious, depressed and disappointed in violent men around me, so having someone tell me \"Girl! Know your worth!\" felt good at first. But after a while, I realized it was just a Mean Girl bootcamp. Even turning against other girls, for stepping out of line. And I mean: You got kicked, if you commented in subs they didn't like. Cult shit.\n\nThat said: While these coaches might indeed bring in numbers...as cheap as I'll sound rn...they are a very small, loud minority. At least in terms of influence. When you see women comment about men on the Internet, you generally hear a desire for respect, equal treatement and equal chores. Stuff like, not wanting to be the main organizers/caretakers for everything anymore, using their own shitty experiences as example. Like the bleak, very true example of men leaving their sick wives/gfs, while women stay for their sick husbands/bfs.\n\nMeanwhile, the provider thing is not just found in Tatertots. It's a very common phrase said by guys. And very little do you see these men use their own examples either. In fact, it's often single men, with main experiences being from dating apps. The only exception for this, might be in terms of emotional labor. Aka, depressingly, a lot of guys indeed make experiences where crying, or showing weakness is seen as an ick or \"unmanly\" by their partners, with many reporting being left because their gf \"just couldn't see them as a man\" anymore. Which...I'm sorry. There's no excuse in hell for that. If you are a woman that does that, you need to get your head checked. Like. Professionally. And your soul. What the fuck.\n\nYou also see it in statistics. Men become more conservative, pushing themself to the idea of \"Men are supposed to be providers\", while women tend to be more liberal. So to see that and then have those men blame WOMEN on that push...yeah. No.",

I see endless complaining about just that on TikTok.

Women have a lot of different opinions, but it's the angry, rude ones that get play on the social media algorithms. \n\nLike many of the women here, I was raised to be able to take care of myself, to want my partner to actually be a partner, not to act like my child or parent. I was told to never go on a date anywhere that I couldn't comfortably afford to pay for myself so that I could politely pay for my half and leave. Never go anywhere without my emergency credit card so that if it goes really wrong I can pay for the whole thing and escape. And to switch back and forth paying for dates, or insist on paying for small supplemental to the date if he insists on paying for dinner. I'm a real person who owns my own condo, and likes guys who are short enough to comfortably kiss (under 5'8\"). \n\nBut this sub, specifically, isn't going to have nearly as many people who follow the types of influencers you are talking about.

I'm serious: Just notice how she is written besides that. How she does only traditionally male sports, drinks beer, calls herself a \"not like other girls\", has little to no female friends and always, always looks like a 9/10 supermodel. \n\nBecause indirectly, everything feminine/womanly is bad, undesirable and worthless if it's not for sex.

            "body": "Any man who thinks that way is held prisoner by his own limited imagination. Because if you were to look around at all, there are plenty of relationships where women out-earn their male partners. There are plenty of relationships where the man is obviously not 6 feet, jacked or incredibly handsome. Most households are split expenses evenly across the board. They simply cannot imagine that there is more to personhood than being either rich or handsome. It's a victim mentality, plain and simple. Part of me wants to say that this logic is the result of being chronically online but it seems as though it's catching on in real life as well.\n\nMen who think like that don't listen to women at all and will fight for the right to be strong and wrong, even when insisting on their limited understanding is making them miserable. I know people complain about dating posts in gendered subs but it's kind of shocking how little men are inclined to research the wealth of information available in spaces like reddit. If you were to read a thread like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1jbjqqq/what_is_the_biggest_problem_you_see_with_men_who/), for example, notice how no one talks about how little money is being earned. It's more about the lack of ambition, prevailing feeling of detachment, no inclination to take accountability for their own problems, miserliness, etc. It's like if they bothered at all to factor in an opinion from women (not men that are trying to grift them into a visceral reaction to not feeling like they're enough) they might stumble upon a cause to shift their perspective and behavior.",

They go & marry women from poor countries, because they are sick of the \"Feminists\" in their country, and want tradition so bad. The women that marry them, as you guess, do it for money. Not just money for them -as a support for their family at home, especially. \n\nThat shit clashes pretty quickly. For example: There was this Tiktoker, named \"From Chad to Dad\". Rich guy, who went out and married a Filipina. Welp. That entire marriage lasted 2 years. Why? Well, not only had he disrespected his wife constantly, he made the mistake to openly disrespect his in-laws. \n\nOn camera, he also admitted that money was a big arguing point for them as a whole: Saying that a man's money is for his kids, not the family of his wife. Which is already the opposite of western \"traditional family values\" (hrough marriage two families become one) -but he said this to a Filipina. Filipinos have VERY strong family ties & values. And that's also why she left him: Disrespecting her, was one thing. But disrespecting her family was the nail in the coffin. \n\nBut yeah. \"Traditional\"",

I did my part and then some. Know what they did? Dangle it over my head, or mistreated me because I had no way out and they freaking knew it. \n\n\nI love to work. I love bringing in money and taking care of my own. Because at the end of the day, I don't have some asshole dangling (you wouldn't have this if it wasn't for me) over my head. I can manage my own finances and buy whatever I want as long as my bills and necessities are paid, without some controlling prick questioning every cent. Even though when I WAS playing that sahm role, I never once bought anything outside of groceries, because it wasn't money that *I* made. \n\n\nI don't have to deal with being stuck in ANY relationship I don't want to be in either, because the man is abusive, or can't keep his dick in his pants. I will never not work now. \n\n\nAnd, by the way, if there ever was a war where people had to be drafted, I'd send my kids to their dad and *I* would be the one going and sending money back home to care for them? Why? Because I have an insane amount of years worth of pent up rage and would go hog wild in the field.\n\n\nBecause of the traumas, abuse, and deaths I've dealt with, I'm able to jump into action during complete and utter chaos. Whereas I've seen the majority of men in my life freeze up or act like chickens with their heads cut off, when something goes sideways. It's not about what makes a \"man\" anymore, it's about what makes an adult. \n\n\nAs far as dates have went, even then I shamefully have to \"emasculate\" a guy. I can't risk it anymore. I've been in too many dates where a guy insisted on paying because they say, and I quote, \"the man is supposed to be a provider\". Which is sweet and all, until it isn't, when they expect sex at the end and get pissed off that you won't jump on their Joystick after a $20 dollar meal like it's owed to them. \n\n\nSo yes, even something as simple as a date, I won't let a man provide anymore. I tell them it's because I feel the dates are for both to put in equal effort and it's the getting to know each other and the vibes that are counting here. \n\n\nHad I have lived this perfect little fairy tale life, and never had MULTIPLE men abuse this \"provider\" status, I might not have this outlook. Sad thing is though, it's definitely not just me who's experienced it. It's millions of women, and centuries of this exact scenario as well.",

He's worked through all kinds of stress,  refused my offer to provide so he could go back to school,  refused to consider a lower paid role,  even if it could later lead to a bounce.  \n\nSome of this is financial anxiety.  We are well off,  but he has seen people fall from where we are,  as have I.  But a big piece of it is in his mind,  he's supposed to always move forward,  not backward,  and he's \"supposed\" to do better.   It's a legitimate social expectation and it's very damaging.

Men are so insecure with egos so fragile they feel they need to subjugate women aren\u2019t men worth knowing. They see vulnerability in conservative women that they can exploit. They make the vulnerable women feel powerful by proximity, put them on a pedestal (for show) but functionally demote them as either wives and mothers (less) or sex objects (less than human). The women believe their only value is in the approval of men because they usually lack their own accomplishments. \u00a0I have yet to see a relationship like this where the women aren\u2019t abused in some way. \u00a0Most of the women value themselves so little that they aren\u2019t even aware of it.

Most of the time, this lack of \"drive\" is about stagnation. Lack of curiosity/interest in the world. Maybe even the opposite: An active xenophobia/anger for any form of change. \n\nA few years ago, I talked about a guy that had interest in me. Even though he was nice, the problem was that we just didn't fit on many levels. Be it education, or interest in current events...the only real talks we could have were about gaming. But the worst thing was his lack of drive/curiosity. He didn't know, but also didn't care to learn. Didn't have a goal in life, or aspirations in his field. And while he was personally happy for whatever I had going on, he also often just \"didn't get\" why I would want more. Or get sad, that I couldn't get something.\n\nBack then, I made a comment like yours on a forum too. Oh boi. A LOT of men did not like that.

Some men are upset because they cannot provide in this economy and because of that they don\u2019t have the same power they had in previous generations.\u00a0\n\nWhenever bitter men make comments like this it\u2019s always because they can\u2019t do something.

It's why we also have more talks of maternity leave and less paternity leave. For one, obviously, because the woman needs time after birth. But two, as shitty as it is, because society doesn't take men wanting to be home into account so much.\n\nThat said, my focus lies on that \"economic status\" you mentioned: In reality, most women couldn't just stay home. The American 50s idea of the man working, and the woman being the carefree trophy housewife is...well. Just the idea of the idealised American 50s. Most of history, women worked. And if they couldn't it was often due to society not allowing women the same work opportunities. Hence my continous references to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, and its famous song \"Diamonds are a girls best friend\".\n\nAgain: Don't get me wrong. I believe & am sorry for your experiences. Especially with the rise of online dating, there's this huge push of \"having to prove value\" because everyone can just swipe on a new, \"better\" date tomorrow. Even worse, since Dating Apps are intentional scammy. It's been proven that algorithms push profiles unevenly/hide them, so especially male users pay more money and get more competitive/less good matches to stay longer. It just kills any connection. I can't imagine being dumped, for the sole reason for not paying an equal meal. I mean. Isn't that the point? You both want a nice time with each other? Both picked a place you like? \n\nThat said: My position remains the same. I can't imagine ANY normal person to be good SO material, if they think like that. Sounds harsh, but: Please stop. Don't pay. Communicate equality from the beginning. Respect yourself and set a standard for other young men to do the same. Cause that's my issue: A lot of young men don't blame in such detail. They might have experiences like you & just blame women as a whole. Which could be acceptable -but as we see in society, this often turns young men to shitty places. Not places that promise more equality, but to go back to even worse times, all because they think \"traditional\" means the happy, carefree American 50s.\n\nAnd trust me. The 50s were good for fucking no one. Not even the food",

The vast majority of women are not the way you describe in reality.  Don\u2019t hang out in online spaces where men assign demeaning intent to women or you will find yourself negatively influenced and believing misogynist propaganda.  The only way to know if a woman believes a man should be her provider is to ask her.  I think you will find that what most women want is equality and reciprocal respect from their partner.  Personally I would never dream of relying on a man to financially support me, I like my career and make more money than any guy I\u2019ve ever dated and would never give that up.  I find men who assume that their paycheck has anything at all to do with my romantic interest to be pathetic, sexist douchebags who need to believe women are whores selling themselves out to the highest bidder they can get.  All of my female friends believe the same.  1953 was a long time ago, back before women were allowed to even have a bank account of their own.  Times have changed.  You can spend your time feeling pissy believing an outdated misogynist phrase is true if you want to, but reality is that\u2019s not going to make you an appealing guy to women.",

Don't get me wrong: The dude is not lying -there are enough women who think like that.

Y'know. Trash? Or just not compatible in values? Why are you pushing yourself for an unequal relationship from the start? To not be lonely? Ok, ok, fair enough. But then stick to it. *Don't pretend* women are all like that shitty gf that you have actively allowed to be unequal to you. *Don't pretend*, women are \"privileged leeches\" to men, when most of us work the same shitty hours as you do.\n\n>Just money and some sense of emotional affection (though even that is debatable, as they refuse to be caregivers or do anything else except the bare minimum)\n\nthat last part especially. I'm a woman with CPTSD. I swear, I *want* to date, but at this point? I am just so terrified in how much indirect rejection I already got from men. Just a few months ago, one man told me to my face that wanting any empathy/accomondation from my partner was \"selfish\". \"Fatalistic\". To just go to therapy until I was \"healed\". 60+ people agreed with him.\n\nNote: I go to therapy. Therapy doesn't heal you, it just helps you to deal with your issues. Trauma will never stop haunting you. That's the \"C\" in CPTSD.",
