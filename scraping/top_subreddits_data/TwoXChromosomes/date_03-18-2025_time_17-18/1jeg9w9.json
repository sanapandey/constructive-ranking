Called the office and they\u2019re wanting to do a diagnostic mammogram with contrast and an ultrasound. All that has me a little worried. Just need some reassurance that people went through the same thing and it was normal. They also said my tissue is dense and I know that can cause issues with seeing things. ",

He took a sample to be sure, but as he was drawing it out was like, \"Yup. Milk. We'll test it to be sure though\".\n\nIt was, in fact, milk.

I just had a six month checkup a couple weeks ago and it was fine. I think it was just a small cyst, but nothing was growing and now they'll just check it at my next annual.\n\nFair warning, insurance may be dumb--I use Anthem BCBS, and I have to pay some out of pocket costs for the six month followup, because it's a diagnostic. So if they tell you to do a followup scan in six months, it might cost you some money. Also, you HAVE to get it done, or they may deny you future visits. At least that's what I was told at my hospital, which doesn't make sense, but whatever.",
