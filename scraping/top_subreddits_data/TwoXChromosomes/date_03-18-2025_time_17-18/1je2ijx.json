    "selftext": "Before I met him I was doing so good. I dated a person with npd for ten years but for 2 years I rebuilt myself and worked so hard on my mental health. \n\nI saved thousands of dollars to be able to get my first apartment to be on my own for the first time. I didn't go out to eat, I didn't buy luxuries, but I was happy. \n\nBut then I met him and I fell in love. And he made me feel safe. And convinced me to buy things that I didn't need. He even said aren't you happy you don't need to look for an apartment anymore? This is your home. \n\nThen things got bad. But I poured my entire soul into trying to help him. He was severely depressed. I would take care of his kid. I loved that kid, though it was overwhelming at times. I was left begging for love and affection. \n\nBut then he told me to leave. No warning, no you have a week to leave, just leave now. And I have no money. I was doing fine before I met him, but now I'm homeless. I have friends with couches, but when will they tell me to leave too? Even if they don't tell me to leave, I feel like a burden. I am mentally preparing myself to live in my car, but it's just not fair. \n\nI am never doing this again. I deserve stability, and I will give it to myself. I have a job, but I will get a second one. I graduate in May with my AA magna cum laude, and I will apply to finish my bachelor's and apply for as many grants as I can. I will rebuild my life. But I will never live with a fucking man again. I am full of love and empathy and kindness, and I will never give that to someone who will just throw me away like I'm trash. ",

I've read that people like us tend to end up in situations like these because we have the mentality that if we just work harder and power through the obstacles, we can make anything work. But in reality it just leads us to fix other's problems (in relationships) and we even enable the underlying cause. We need let things fail more - BOUNDARIES, basically!! I think in this context it is quite common - I know many successful women persevering with men that cannot live up to their aspirations. I think part of it is that we see the potential in them, but that is all it is: potential. They themselves need to realise it, and we cannot do that for them.",

If she was giving up her home she needed to know she had security.  He wanted more from her but couldn't promise stability, so she stopped seeing him.  A couple years later she met a man who said he would only put her name on his house if they were married, but by that point she owned her own house.  Eventually he moved in with her and got a rental company to manage his house (as an AirBnB, I think).  They did get married and now her name is on two houses.

I was making very little money and had no grasp of how little his salary (which was double mine) could buy in NYC. He wound up with thousands in credit card debt from things we had done together, which I paid from my savings. The relationship went south for reasons other than money, although it certainly played a role when I realized that we would be unable to afford to have children.\n\nAfter that , I made up my mind that I would never be financially dependent on a partner, and I stuck to that. I got married and had 2 kids. My husband didn\u2019t earn much for most of our marriage, but he is very responsible with money and savvy about investing, and we have more than we need. And he contributed in many other ways. But I think that if I had been depending on my husband to contribute more equally from salary, we wouldn\u2019t have worked out.\n\nOP, you sound like you are on a similar journey. You have incredible potential, and I think you\u2019re going to do great.",

With a sizeable debt, after having bought everything in our (rented) house.\n\nFortunately my family is well-off and paid my debt and helped me rebuild myself.
