The problem is yeah, you may be able to prevent it in software from charging the top 20% but you have no way in software to prevent your phone from dying completely which happened way more than previous phones so I totally fucked the battery that way. So the pro tip I have is just use the phone. Charge it to max berceuse you don\u2019t know what day you\u2019re gonna run it to 0% and it\u2019s gonna happen more frequently if you\u2019re starting your day from 80%",

In unexpected situations, sure your phone can run to 0%, but it dropping to 0% once or twice isn't going to significantly damage your battery.\n\nIf your battery drops to 0% enough to damage the battery it's probably on your own poor device discipline.",

The battery science behind this is sound if you can maintain the charge at both ends of the cycle. If you yourself (not you /u/-disagreeable- specifically) feel like you might not be able to prevent the draining fully it might not be worth it.\n\nIf given a second chance I would definitely do the same thing, just set it to charge to 90% or 95%.

Most people sip charge and don't abuse their batteries. So most people this is maybe like 10%. Meaningful but not that big a deal.",

Chargers have their preferred pulse type rate that is specific for each battery chemistry, and they have fallback circuitry that gives lower charge rate. What that means is that the frequency of the pulses of charge and the checking of voltage of the battery varies differently. A pulse of voltage too high is like having high blood pressure and it gives wear and tear on the chemistry of the battery. This is if you are using your phone or your electric device on a high term basis or a high discharge basis. I have a phone that's lasted 9 years and hasn't had a problem, it's capacitance has decreased. I'm sorry voice to text is messing up, the word is its capacitance has decreased, but only marginally because of regular wear and tear on the battery. I have another electronic device that I charged with battery packs because it's internal battery pack w o u l d only last one hour, and its capacitance has decreased to a maximum of 90% over 3 years. So yeah cheap lightning cables can deliver energy different rates, but does it really matter to non scientists? No. No no no no.

But they get...quirky, after a while, even after factory reset. With my first few phones, they'd last 4-5 years, no problem. Nowadays I feel lucky if I get 2 years. All Android btw. Nothing against Apple, just prefer Android.\n\nBut yeah, I'll keep this in mind for my long-term electronics, but for a phone it's not worth the hassle to me.",

I have no idea why she wouldn't strongly advocate being just a bit careful.\n\nI have no expertise in batteries, but I do use an app called AccuBattery.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digibites.accubattery. \n\nIt's freemium (I don't even think it has like full page or timed ads, just bar ads), and seems to have good science backing it. The app tracks usage, battery health, and sounds an alarm at charge percentages of your choice so you remember to unplug it. A lot of newer phones have the charge stopper natively.\n\nSo, everything I'm about to say is based on that apps claims, and my shoddy understanding.\n\nBatteries degrade. You only get to charge them a certain number of times. Eventually your 5000mah battery will only hold 2500mah. Let's say it takes like 1000 recharges / cycles and the battery is getting close to dead.\n\nCharging 0%-100 counts as 1 cycle.  \nFull 5000mah.  \n\nCharging 20%-80 counts as 0.2 cycles.  \nCharges to 4000mah, you get 3000mah.  \n\nThe top and low ends of charging account for the majority of wear.  \n\nSo, if you go into a store, and they're like 'would you like a 100g chocolate bar for a dollar, or a 60g bar for 20 cents?'... what would you choose?\n \nIf you 'swing' it like this you can see you're probably gaining at least a 60% better battery life.\n\nLike if you replace a phone every 2 years because the battery sucks, you can get at least another year of life out of it. The times when you do charge it to 100%, it will last longer. You'll spend less, and it's better for the environment.",

This is the rate of charge And discharge, combined. All batteries have a nominal C rate, and it\u2019s recommended to never go above it, as increased charging and discharging induces heat, which can gradually cause the chemicals in your battery to react, change, and therefor hold less of a charge. My biggest recommendation after learning this is to never charge and discharge your battery at the same time (if you can help it). If I am wrong, please correct me, as I do not want to spread misinformation, particularly about lithium based batteries known for their thermal runaway (once they reach a certain temperature, the chemical reaction taking place feeds itself [positive feedback reaction], and continues to rise until, well, Boom.",

If this was too long I'll make it simple; most people are unaware that the capacitance of their battery degrades quite slowly relative to how long they keep the device. Backup batteries kind of eliminate the concern. The signal to noise ratio suggests we just keep it silent.",

It's marginal or it's not marginal, you can't half agree on something being relative to a small degree unless you're saying a small degree is a great degree which means it's not marginal at all. So I'm going to assume you disagree with me. That sentence makes more sense on paper where I am drawing my equation. Strangely you are wrong about lead acid although you should be right, as I've let acid batteries that have zero voltage and put them right back to work after a few years. Engineering is detailed and not a whole bunch of fluff and crap, you are correct. Engineers make things work or find out where they don't. I like engineers. The general populace doesn't understand what Engineers say, because the general populace is quite stupid. Downvote this all you guys want. Most people can't think at the level of engineering and science. And most people don't care or need to care about losing 10% capacitance if their battery when they're replacing their device 5 minutes after they purchased it.",

You would open up the tap fully and then gradually shut it down as the glass gets full to avoid spilling.
