It would be impossible to list every reason why some people feel the need to seek attention, but the following are examples of some potential causes of this behavior:\n\n* They have low self-esteem and need continuous praise and reassurance from others.\n* They are jealous of someone else, so they attempt to divert all attention to themselves.\n* They are lonely and feel like their only option is to call attention to themselves.\n* They have unmet emotional needs that they are incapable of expressing in a healthier manner.\n* They have suffered a great loss (such as a divorce or the death of a loved one) and are feeling disconnected or unmoored.\n* They have a history of abuse, neglect, or other untreated trauma.\n* They were raised in a dysfunctional environment.\n* They have poor communication and/or socialization skills and thus find it difficult to engage with others in more appropriate ways.\n* They have insufficient stress management skills, and use attention to distract themselves from their emotional distress.\n* They have histrionic personality disorder or another mental health condition.",

But a lot of younger folks think the phrase is \"bop your head\" instead of \"bob your head\" because of mispronunciation, kinda like an r/boneappletea thing.  \n\nSo calling a girl a \"bop\" all came to be because people misheard/mispronounced the phrase \"bob your head,\" thought it was \"bop your head,\" and now essentially use the word bop in place of bob.",

You sound like such a kind, trusting person, and like I said before, it\u2019s your choice and your prerogative to talk to random strangers on the subway.

So, I will definitely continue to carry my pepper spray and I\u2019ll be ready to spray a MF in their face if they try anything funny!!\ud83d\ude01",
