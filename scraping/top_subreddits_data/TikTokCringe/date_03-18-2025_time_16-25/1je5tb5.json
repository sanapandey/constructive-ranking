It's incredibly unlikely to be enriching for your dog lol\n\nSo not only do people fake service dogs to circumvent regulations, but they're also probably just stressing their dog out for clout.",

The dog 's tail remained tucked until the dog used it to help move away from Tigger.\n\nHere's more:  When a dog shows you it's teeth,  it isn't smiling.   Exaggerated *yawns* & tongue flicking are signs of anxiety. \n\nDogs are not complicated.\n\nEdit add-on:\n\nIf the tail wags predominantly to one side,  that is NOT a happy dog.  A tail that is tucked tightly into the dog's butt, but wags at the tail's end is NOT a happy dog either. \n\nPeople will smile or laugh when they are nervous.   They smile when forced to smile for photos.   Some people smile to avoid conflict.  Does a smile mean a person is happy?   No.",

I never said anything like that. I pointed out it flops on its back, wags its tail, licks, and requests further pets. All of that happens. So the dog was clearly enjoying that attention.\n\nYou're saying it was uncertain and nervous to start, and I agree. Lots of things make dogs nervous and uncertain before they figure out the situation. My parents dog is nervous everyone I visit until he gives me a sniff and becomes a soppy baby. Does that mean I'm abusing my parents dog when I visit? Lots of dogs panic at people knocking on the front door, are door knickers dog abusers?\n\nA dog being nervous is not a sign of an unusual encounter is not signs of dog abuse. The fact the video doesn't show the few seconds of the dog acclimatising to the attention is not a sign it was abused.",

After the kids got their picture with Tigger I went up and was casually like \"Do you mind if I get a photo real quick? You were always my favorite when I was a kid.\"\n\nTigger whirled around, grabbed me by the shoulders, and pulled me in for (no exaggeration) the best hug I've ever had. He acted like he was seeing an old friend for the first time in years. I'm grown-ass man and I CRIED. In that moment it wasn't a sweaty college kid in a fur suit, it WAS Tigger.\n\nDisney can be an evil corporate monopoly, but the cast members that do those meet & greets are straight up magical.",
