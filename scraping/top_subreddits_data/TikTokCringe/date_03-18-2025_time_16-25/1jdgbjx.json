The concert was free in the parking lot for the old Atlanta Braves stadium, and you got all you can eat slim Jim's. They had sexy nurses come by with medical bags and they'd say something like \"you need 500cc of slim Jim\". Anyways, it was kind of this all afternoon event with midget wrestling, mechanical bulls, carnival games and a freak show. \n\nWhen the freak show happened, there was a guy just like this. It was kinda at night at that point and he would do tricks like smoke a cigarette and puff and smoke ring out of it as well as stick a flash light in his mouth to make him a human jack o lantern. That was a good day.",
