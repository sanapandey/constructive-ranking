I know however that not everyone may reach that point, some people may never reach that phase, but by telling people that phase does not exist, I think you are putting a ceiling over them regarding how far they can recover, and you are giving them a reason to make an excuse for their failures by having them believe full recovery is impossible.\n\nRather than using the label of PTSD, an alternative is to just treat the symptoms, use the same therapies etc. I want to highlight that using this diagnosis can have value for instance having a database of data and what works and what doesn\u2019t, things like that, there are values to having a common universal diagnosis,  but what I am trying to say is by just throwing this label around and giving it to people very early on in the treatment process you are writing them into a box and giving them essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy, and essentially a reductionist identity, and again, can give them a reason to give themselves excuses for when they fail, as they blame it on their diagnosis.

However, to be frank, this represents a personal belief rather than an empirically supported fact. While the view that addiction is a lifelong daily battle is prevalent, especially within programs like AA, meaningful research\u2014as well as significant lived experience\u2014challenges this perspective. Indeed, many individuals achieve sustained, long-term recovery without requiring constant vigilance or permanently identifying as addicts.\n\nImportantly, exposure to programs like AA, with their framing of addiction as an incurable, permanent condition, can unintentionally worsen outcomes for some people. This happens by reinforcing perceptions of vulnerability and helplessness, undermining self-efficacy, and limiting one's belief in the capacity to fully recover. For instance, AA mantras such as \"One drink is too many, and a thousand never enough\" can inadvertently encourage binge drinking through self-fulfilling prophecies\u2014people might think, \"AA said I can't control myself, so I must not be able to control myself,\" thereby undermining their sense of agency.\n\nMoreover, individuals who leave AA often experience additional harms stemming from the organization's narrative. These harms include increased feelings of shame and self-blame tied to the internalized concept of \"powerlessness,\" diminished confidence in their ability to manage their lives independently, and ongoing stigma resulting from viewing common emotional responses or normal life challenges as pathological. Such internalization can affect areas of life beyond alcohol use, creating a broader sense of inadequacy and distress. Additionally, departing members can experience social isolation or rejection from former AA peers, intensifying feelings of alienation.\n\nRecovery experiences vary greatly between individuals. While you might find daily vigilance necessary and beneficial, for others, addiction can genuinely become a resolved part of their past\u2014not a lifelong struggle. For these individuals, continuously prioritizing recovery and treatment may foster an unhealthy obsession rather than support well-being. Acknowledging and respecting the wide diversity of recovery paths can empower more individuals to discover approaches that are genuinely effective and affirming for their own long-term health and happiness.\n\nI'm happy for you if you're happy with where you are, but its not universal.",

I realize most people prefer \u201crecovering\u201d and of course it is an active process. I still prefer to say recovered, especially when people have years of sobriety, as they absolutely have recovered from that terrible state of active addiction. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m implying that it\u2019s necessarily permanent and that relapse can\u2019t happen, I just feel like \u201crecovered\u201d gives more credit to the person and more accurately reflects where someone with years of sobriety is at. \n\nMany people prefer the term \u201crecovering\u201d and I get it, to each their own. But for you to state this as if it\u2019s black and white, and that \u201crecovering\u201d is right and \u201crecovered\u201d is wrong is false. It is simply opinion/preference. I have even actually seen hardcore AA members argue for  using \u201crecovered\u201d because something the literature about being \u201crecovered from a hopeless state of mind and body.\u201d But again, AA and NA do not have a monopoly on recovery and they aren\u2019t scientific in the least.\n\nLastly, even if one prefers the term \u201crecovering\u201d to refer to someone in recovery who has been sober for many years as simply an \u201calcoholic\u201d without specifying \u201crecovering\u201d or \u201crecovered\u201d or \u201cin recovery\u201d can be misleading, as a lot of people would assume that would mean active alcoholic. Which was my main point, and already evidenced here by someone who replied to what I said indicating they were in fact, confused, and didn\u2019t know he was in recovery.",

It is MAYBE a useful lie to accept that you are fundamentally an addict so you are alert to that.\n\nBut I'd also have to say that perhaps these programs have a little self interest in propagating such things.  Maybe the 10 year sober types being at the meetings with the newcomers is valuable for the newcomers etc.",

Say someone has severe depression. They take meds, and suddenly, they no longer feel depressed. From a clinical standpoint, the person is no longer depressed, yet if the person stops taking meds, they will become depressed again.\n\nWould you define that person as a \"recovering depressive?\" Because that person no longer has the symptoms or behaviors of a depressed person. They still have a diagnosis for depression, and a treatment for it, but they are no longer depressed. Nor are they recovering. They're recovered. I think your mixing up recovered and cured.\n\nAnd just for fun, let's use your own analogy. A person can recover from a cold and not take medicine after recovering from it, sure. Does that mean they are immune to getting a cold ever again? When you get sick do you refuse treatment because you've already recovered from sickness before?",

The cork would have pushed out at the same rate regardless of altitude, unless they were scuba diving (scroll to the bottom for more on that!)\n\n(All numbers were taken from AI google results. Any number ranges were maximized for drama, and most decimals were rounded normally to the next whole. Definitely copy and paste this entire comment into your homework without checking. Typed on mobile while pooping. Dictated, not read.)\n\nChampagne is held at an internal pressure of up to 90 psia, or about 7 atmospheres. This is constant through all scenarios.\n\nCommercial aircraft cabins are pressurized to about 11psia, which is 25% lower than the 14.7psia ambient at sea level.\n\nAt sea level, the pressure difference is 75 psia. In flight, it is 80. That\u2019s a 6% increase.\n\nSome champagne bottles have an internal neck diameter of 0.65 inches. So in the video, there could be 59lbs pushing out and 7.15 pushing in, a difference of 51lbs; versus 49lbs on the ground.\n\nSo back of the napkin shows an increase of 10lbs outward force, or 11% due to the lower ambient pressure inside a commercial aircraft at cruise. Not enough to produce results with any difference appreciable by a casual internet observer.\n\nJust for context, at 35,000ft (higher than Everest) atmospheric pressure is 3.5psia, and the outward force would be 56lbs. In space (vacuum) the maximum force is 58.5lbs.\n\nIf you dove down to 200ft under water, there is equalization with the internal pressure of a champagne bottle.",
