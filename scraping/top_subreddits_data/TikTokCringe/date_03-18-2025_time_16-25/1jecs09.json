The intentional obfuscation of tax laws and creation accounting offices and tax software that specialize in just tax returns is a scam for sure, but paying taxes isn't the scam, the collusion between the government and those businesses are the scam.",

They don't want to help you they want to control you. They take away your speech to stop you from calling them out. They create laws that only apply to you while breaking those same laws. It's a do as I say not as I do system. They steal your wages time and ultimately your life all to further their own desire for power and wealth.  There is no freedom without liberty. We are slaves to a system they have created that only serves them. You scream I can't afford food and they say maybe eat cereal for dinner. You say egg prices are too high they say maybe skip breakfast no big deal. They poison our food and make us sick and then say Ozempic will help!!!    \n  \nWhen will you all realize we are being lead to our own destruction. Because we still give them the benefit of the doubt that they are compassionate and care. Why don't they help where its really needed? Why are there starving people anywhere in the world? Why do people suffer and die from treatable diseases anywhere in the world? Why are we still fighting wars and killing each other? Its because they control the narrative and they control YOU.   \n  \nI hate to say it but when you finally realize the gravity of the situation it will be to late. You're being lead to the slaughter and cheering them on like YEAH THATS RIGHT!!!",

                    "body": "Humanity will be destroyed by its own hedonism. Instead of acknowledging the challenges that stand in the way of global prosperity and identifying methods to address them, we are driven merely by the desire to live a life of luxury while ignoring the associated consequences. Americans in particular have become fat and lazy, allowing every corporate entity we interact with on a daily basis to pick our pockets while claiming that they're offering an essential service at a reasonable cost. Pretending that everything will work itself out while refusing to lift a finger when another false prophet comes along to make things worse.\n\nPoliticians are bankrolled by the same companies that stand to lose profit if any regulations are created that would expose their extreme exploitation of people and the environment. Every time the political cycle reaches a fever pitch, we point fingers at each other and play tug of war rather than having intellectual dialogue and debate over political issues. \n\nWhen anyone points out the obvious failures of our capitalist world system, they get called an extremist who wants to sow discord. When the atrocities created by our endless greed are revealed, everyone turns to thoughts and prayers and absolves themselves of responsibility. We shrug our shoulders , while stuffing another piece of processed food infected with micro plastics down our gullet. Or we take a mind altering drug to briefly forget about our sins. Or we continue to stare at a screen with such rapture that the world around us fades away.\n\nWe, as a species, are sleepwalking toward our own extinction while dreaming about a society that gives us \"limitless freedoms\" as long as we play the game according to the arbitrary rules defined by those who have the capital to buy favor with the officials who organize it. We bemoan our petty plights while happily consuming the world around us until there will be nothing left but empty skyscrapers, a layer of radiation in the soil, and plastic in the oceans.",

In the countries where this is a thing it\u2019s in a limited capacity, still requires the citizens input, and comes with its own set of negative complications.\n\nAdditionally, for the majority of Americans, the free tax filing options are more than sufficient. FreeTaxUSA.com exists and could not be more simple. The people who should be paying for tax services have complex balance sheets that benefit from having a professional look at them. Saying that \u201cAmericans spend millions on tax services\u201d is as disingenuous as saying \u201cAmericans spend millions on Yacht cleaning services\u201d.\n\nApparently hot take: If you\u2019re the kind of person who gets tricked by Jiffy Lube into buying a new air filter then yes the current tax system is being rigged against you by TurboTax lobbbyists. But if you finished elementary school math and can follow basic instructions you really shouldn\u2019t be struggling with taxes.",
