So, huge cooperations basically extort these extra fees from farmers, because to sell on a larger scale, not just the local mom and pop grocery stores, you need to grow these patented varieties. In some countries you aren't even allowed to grow any other varieties without a permisson. \n\nNow, if some third party would offer the same seeds for the same plants, would it make it fake seeds, growing fake plants and creating fake food this way?",
