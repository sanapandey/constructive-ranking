    "selftext": "I bought these two pairs of jeans directly from Madman\u2019s Taobao because I needed them urgently. Trusted his size charts, and surprise, they were hilariously off. The Big Ol' Stussy Denim Jeans, listed as a size 32, came with a 37\u201d (94cm) waist\u2014definitely not what I was expecting. Oh, and the size chart? It's helpfully in S to XL, because who doesn\u2019t love a little extra confusion?\n\nOn the other hand, the Dime black jeans at least kept their size chart consistent\u2014S to XL all the way. Unfortunately, the waist measurement was still about 10cm off, with the actual product measuring 91cm instead of the 81cm on the chart.\n\nI\u2019m now a proud owner of 2 pairs of completely useless jeans. If anyone is wondering, my waist size is 32\u201d 81cm. Lesson learnt, don\u2019t buy in the last minute, always go through agent and pay extra for actual waist measurements so an exchange or refund is possible. ",

            "body": "Hello,\n\nAbout Stussy: This is our traditional measurement method for making pants (natural top flat measurement). We have sold 3,000 pairs, and the basic error is very small.\n\nYou may wonder: size32=81CM waist size, but retail is not like this. We follow up all the details including all sizes. I compared our size chart with a randomly selected product and it was very accurate. .\n\nWe are the most professional in making stussy jeans, and other else's are garbage quality.\n\nAbout dime: This may be a batch problem, and it is indeed very different from my size chart. Because my size chart was counted 2 years ago. For DIME products, I can refund you or reissue compensation.\n\nSorry for the problems you had to deal with, we will try to improve and fix every issue. If your jeans size 32 came with 94cm waist please contact me on discord ticket or thru whatsapp but I think it if you messure it my way it will be the same as size chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n93gp2h3yhpe1.jpeg?width=1158&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d9ec695f25e6afa53f356bd280a99552fa56cdc",
