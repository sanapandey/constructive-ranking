    "selftext": "Most of the stuff I found on the trusted seller lists and from reviews posted on the sub. As you will be able to tell I really like Rick Owens and MM6. I hope you enjoy the review and maybe find some inspiration for your next haul\n\nProject bag: I will use this for groceries, I looks good but the stitching is really wonky.\n\nRick Owens tee: I was looking for this everywhere and I finnaly found it. Reallz happy withthis one, looks good compaed to retail, but its kinda thin, still wearable tho.\n\nStone island hat: Badge looks good, the fit is good too\n\nRick owens Subhuman jeans: Dont like the look of these irl. I think they are too baggy compared to retail, also the shade of brown just looks wrong.\n\nRick Owens band: Good quality, very cheap. Worth the price\t\t\t\t                                                   \n\nKsubi jeans: Good quality denim, They fit a bit skinny, I think they look good compared to retail, but kinda pricey. Also they fit small\n\nMM6 mask: Very small opening, kinda weird for wearing, I will use this for headrest in my car\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMM6 Cardigan: Love this, the quality is good, the fit is really nice, looks casual and formal at the same time. It fits true to size\n\nRick Owens: These look the same as my friends retail pair. Must cop if you like this model. Best item in the haul. They fit tts but are kinda snug, I think with wearing they will be good tho.\n\nDuffle: Overpriced, I was expecting exceptional quality, but its just mid.\n\nMM6 zip: Very nice, thick material, feels soft. The fit is really nice, slightlz baggy. and it fits tts\n\nAcne Studios tee: Nice quality, its a simple tee, but still looks really nice. Fits big\n\nMM6 shoes: Love these, I think this is the best batch, it looks pretty good, there are some minor flaws tho.\n\nHeadphones: These are supposed to be Sonys, but dont really look like that, stull took them cuz thez are verz cheap. The sound qualitz is okay, build quality is not that goo tho\n\t\t\t\nPurple brand jeans: Good quality, skinny fit, very similar to Ksubi ones\n\nDior B30: I love these, I dont know how these are compared to retail, but they were really cheap and worth the price imo.\n\nLego: I will be assmbling this in a few days and make an update. But for now it looks really promising, I just hope none of the pieces are missing\n",
