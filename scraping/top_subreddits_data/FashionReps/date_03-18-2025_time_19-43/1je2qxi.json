    "selftext": "Took the Alpha SV Arc'teryx (XXL) out again today, and it\u2019s holding up perfectly. Stayed completely dry and windproof after cutting through deep powder and handling some strong winds higher up. The hood fits nicely over my helmet, which really helps on those colder lifts.\n\nSince it was warmer at the base today, I went with just a base and mid-layer underneath. Much more comfortable without overheating. My local Japanese retail goretex pants are also performing great, keeping me dry and warm throughout.\n\nThe Alpha SV\u2019s pocket space came in handy again for keeping my ski pass and water bottle accessible, and the pit zips were a lifesaver when I needed to cool down. Definitely appreciating how functional this jacket is in these conditions.\n\n\nhttps://shop1648171445.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7321132673&spider_token=063e&ifr=itemdetail&state=H5WXshareOld&distributorId=1774167126\n",
