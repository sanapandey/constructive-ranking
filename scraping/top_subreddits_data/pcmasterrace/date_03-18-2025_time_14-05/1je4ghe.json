There are definitely better ways of doing it, but it works. The network equipment has their own UPS too...well, some of it does. It's a wifi mesh network, and I'm okay with partially degraded coverage during a power outage.",

Most UPSes won't power themselves from cheaper square wave / simulated sine wave devices, as it generates MUCH quicker heat buildup than normal, and those cheap ones are designed to run out of backup power under normal usage to *prevent* their overheating.",

Instead they run the device off the battery and just keep recharging from the wall.

When it sees the power drop, it SWITCHES over to the batteries and inverter. This has a delay, and sometimes this delay is too long for some devices, or it happens during a part of the phase that your PC power supply isn't prepared to hold up for the delay time, etc. Basically, 80%+ of the time it will work fine, but there's always a chance it won't switch fast enough and you'll lose power on a device or devices for a split second.\n\nLine-interactive (Medium):\n\nThe inverter/rectifier used for battery charging is also the output inverter. It switches direction when the power drops to provide power. There is still a delay, ,but it is MUCH less than the above. 95%+ reliability.\n\nOnline/Double-Conversion (Most Expensive):\n\nThe UPS is constantly charging the batteries on one side, and running off of the batteries through the inverter on the other. Since this UPS is always running off the batteries, there is absolutely no switching or swapping required when the power drops. The batteries... just stop being charged. 0 Delay time, 99.999% Reliable\n\n\nIf you want near-guaranteed zero drops, then you need a Double Conversion.",

You'll just find out by your PC shutting off when your power goes out. You also want to test it under load to check if it can handle the worst case scenario and for how long.\n\nMost UPS have replaceable batteries. Take the batteries to a battery store so they can pick the same type for you and recycle the old ones.

It's going to be about $150 for a 2000VA UPS.\n- Replace fan it comes with with a better one (e.g. Noctua) - they tend to be loud\n\nDouble conversion UPS does AC->DC, DC->AC conversion all the time.
