It weighed like nothing and screamed low quality.    I didn't use it as a result, used a quality power supply in it's place.    \n\nAbout a year later, a buddy (university student  \n) needed a power supply and asked about it.    We nick named it the whiffer.       I gave it to him and told him that it couldn't possibly be a decent power supply because it weighed 1/4 of what normal power supplies weighed at the time.   However he used it anyway.    \n\nAbout a month later we were playing a game together and the magic smoke and bright blue electrical arcing colors erupted from within the power supply.     \n\nOddly enough his computer survived unscathed - other than of course needing a new power supply.",
