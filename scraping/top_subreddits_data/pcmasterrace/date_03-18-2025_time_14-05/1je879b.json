Unfortunately, it just looks completely awful to play anything at lower resolutions. Some people may not be as sensitive to it, but for me, as soon as the target resolution doesn't match the display resolution, it undermines everything good about the image quality. Textures look low res, text is blurry, lighting looks fake, there's just nothing about it I find remotely usable. It's the same way that watching 1080p content on a 4K TV looks noticably worse than watching it on a 1080p TV. You need upscaling or else the extra pixels just become a recipe for poor definition.\n\nNow, with that being said, I do upscale my games from 1440p or 1080p using DLSS almost constantly. Especially since DLSS 4 came out, which looks remarkably good, even when turning a 1080p render back into 4K. There's relatively few games that I game at native 4K, but as long as there's a good DLSS implementation for the game in question, I end up with a terrific image.",

This is why I got a 180hz with my 4070S, because anything more isn't even going to make a visual difference since every game I play runs at 150 on high at best.\n\nI do miss when 60 was good enough for me. I try to go back and it looks really juddery. But in like 5-10 years I'm sure I'll get used to it again since I have absolutely no plans to get rid of this GPU before then. My 1050 lasted me 8 years and I plan to match that.",

Your fps doesn't have to lock to the exact max refresh rate of your monitor to make it 'worth it'. \n\nI have a 4K 240hz OLED. Some games max out the hz and some don't. Doesn't really matter because regardless its freaking awesome.",
