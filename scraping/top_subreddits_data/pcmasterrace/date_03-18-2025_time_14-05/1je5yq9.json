    "selftext": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share an incident that happened last night.\n\nI own a Gigabyte 4080 Aero OC 16GB, and I started noticing a burning smell coming from my PC. It turned out that the PCIe power supply pins were melting inside the PSU ports, along with the 16-pin 12VHPWR connector that came with the GPU.\n\nThankfully, the GPU itself is fine.\n\nI\u2019ve been using a Zalman ZM1200-EBT 1200W Gold PSU since 2016, but I was already considering upgrading to a more up-to-date ATX 3.0+ PSU. It seems my current PSU couldn\u2019t handle the power demands of my GPU.\n\nFor reference, all PCIe cables were properly connected, as I was already aware of the melting cable issues reported worldwide.",

            "body": "Yea your PSU is old, but I don't think that was an issue caused by your PSU.\n\nThose 12VHPWR cables are flawed. Add that the GPU does not load regulate anymore if any one pin fails, so it'll dump and pull the power from wherever has the least resistance. Then things heat up and start melting because of the over current draw through a single cable. But the cables housing for 12VHPWR are too thick for the housing they go into because everytime you have to plug it in, you're slowly shaving off pieces of the plastic which create risks of excessive heat and melting plastic.",

While it's great that it's holding up, newer PSUs are just generally better quality, and have better protective systems in place to help prevent issues with the newer hardware being more power hungry these days.",

It relies on a combination of overkill safety factor and reasonable board design. If that adapter is more or less just connecting 8-pin lines to 12-pin lines internally, an unbalanced connection could readily overload an 8-pin's single connector. The 8-pin spec requires less per-pin capacity than a 12-pin, so even if the 12-pin is fine here, it could have been well over what OP's decade-old 8-pins were able to provide on that pin.",

It's really sketchy when you look in the nvidia adapters. der8auer did a video ripping one apart literally and figuratively.",

Bad connection + too much power through small leads that can't handle it, that's always been what's established to be the issue. That's why 4090s melt when you don't have the cable plugged all the way in or bend it. This is common knowledge and why you have tons of warnings included with new gpus that have 12vhpwr in the instructions. Bending the adapters too severely breaks the solder joints, leading to bad connections, leading to extreme heat. \n\nI find it funny that you cite gamers nexus and then ignore what gamers nexus said on this a year ago.",
