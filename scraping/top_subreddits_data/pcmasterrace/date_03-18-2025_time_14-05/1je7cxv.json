Around the same time, my 10 year old nephew who is very shy gathered the courage to actually call me and ask for advice about PC parts. He had a budget of $300, and while I was laughing at that in my head, I ended up selling it to him for $200 (I bought it for about 3k around peak Covid time). I took a major L on it, but to him it was the deal of a lifetime. I\u2019m happy my nephew got bragging rights to tell his Fortnite buddies how cool he is. \n\nMy uncle sold me his SNES and like 10 games for $20 in the early 90s. Just trying to keep the tradition alive!",
