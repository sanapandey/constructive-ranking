Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX is sufficient, most people don't need 800 series chipset\n\n- PSU overkill. If you don't think you'll be upgrading within ~5 years, don't bother leaving too much power overhead. Take PCPP's power estimate, add either 250W or 20%, whichever is lower.\n\n- No need to buy Windows right now, you can use it with a watermark for a bit and then see if it bothers you",

My 3080ti works great at 1440p, but it struggles with RT effects enabled on my 4K120 TV. Checking RivaTuner, it seems like 12 GB just isn't enough for stuff like Alan Wake II and CP2077 at 4K with RT.\n\nI want to play these games at 4K with RT, but I want to make sure the 5080 can handle it. I've been poring over reviews, but most seem to focus on pure raster, or situations that are useful for comparing across cards but not how I'd actually use the damn thing (i.e., Gamers Nexus' marks are all done with FSR instead of DLSS. There is no reason to use FSR instead of DLSS on my couch.)\n\nIs the 5080 going to let me play games at 4K with DLSS and most RT effects enabled, or am I going to be in the same boat as my 3080ti: one or two effects on, but mostly traditional rasterized rendering.",
