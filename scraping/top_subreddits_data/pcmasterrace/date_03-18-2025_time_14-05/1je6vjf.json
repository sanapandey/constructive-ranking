So you're blind for that brief time. However, to account for that, your brain fills in that gap with older info and it just tricks you into thinking you're seeing something. \n\nYou can test this by looking at an analog clock with a second hand. \n\nLook away from the clock then look back and focus on the second hand. Due to the brain filling in the gap from the eye movement, the second hand will appear to be stuck in place for about a second before it starts to move at its correct pace.  This is because the second hand (and everything else) you're seeing for that second or so is \"fake\", just a placeholder your brain created.",

Higher framerates became a thing with video games because of the greater precision in shooter games, especially multiplayer.\n\nFor example, in animation, rotoscoping in 24 fps always looked unnatural and janky compared to proper 2d animation, which was more often than not 12 fps. And rotoscoping is a very old technique, used in the very first cartoons, and only LATER they found out 12 fps works better for certain shots.\n\nAll these standards are a result of decades of MEAN technical and social engineering and testing.

Assuming that upper bound of human vision at 15-20ms per \"view\".\n\nAt T+0:00::004 the 240hz panel shows you a head to click.\n\nAt T+0:00::008 the 240hz panel shows you the head to click now slightly to the right. \n\nT+::012, 016... New frames, head moving. \n\nT+ ::020 your brain interprets \"T player head running toward right\" and you begin signaling your mouse hand move toward the head.\n\nYour reflex triggered at T+20ms and you click that headshot 20ms later. \n\nThe 30hz display shows you the first frame at T::033. \n\nYou don't get the direction data until T::066 assuming you with out the travel direction in 2 stills rather than 5 stills you're clicking heads at the 86ms mark. \n\nThe issue is less you processing all 5 frames in detail or not, it's that the median time to first opportunity at 240hz is 2ms (the event to be shown on screen could happen anywhere between immediately after the last frame was drawn resulting in 4ms of delay down to immediately before the next frame resulting in essentially TOF of the elections and photons.) the median time for 30hz is 16.5ms. both are faster than your reaction time, but one is 8x closer to the starting pistol. \n\n\nLook at Olympic sprinters, a recent race did calibrated exactly synchronized starting \"guns\" as speakers behind the runners. The woman who came in first place beat 2nd place by less time than the speed of sound difference between the two. (Meaning a starting pistol would've set 2nd place in motion earlier enough than 1st place that 2nd would've won if they hadn't made the time of flight equal.) Obviously reaction time is FAR slower than mach1, but we're not running on a perfectly synchronized clock, we don't delay the stimulus until the next cycle, we just take lag time from stimulus to action.",

It doesn't help that some of the empirical tests that have been done are awfully subjective, with questionable sample pools & sizes, methods limited by image content, etc.  But the best & most likely correct studies conclude a perceptive ceiling around 500Hz.\n\nIndividual photoreceptors fire 5-20 times per second (roughly 10Hz on average).  But the human eye contains millions of them.  They don't fire in synchrony.  The cycles are constantly overlapping.  So, physically, from the perspective of the sensor, the collective framerate is somewhat dynamic and orders of magnitude in excess in 10Hz lol.  The biggest impact on vision framerate comes from processing, which leads to a dynamic range of framerate based on image content (i.e. motion).\n\nAt most, there's a typical limit beyond which it is not possible to discern a difference, but it doesn't vary as much as people say it does within age groups.  More or less, any young person with properly corrected vision (and no atypical brain structure or injury) can see the difference with a little bit of training & experience.  If someone thinks they can't, they are most likely underestimating their abilities.  Think about it like this: a difference only needs to be perceived sometimes in order to conclude the difference is framerate is perceivable.  It doesn't need to be obvious or perceivable all the time, just some of the time at a frequency higher than random chance.",

Partly because our eyes don't \"vsync\" with the computer - so it's very possible your eyes could refresh twice when your computer only refreshes once a lot of the time at 60 FPS...\n\nBut the more interesting reason is that even if your eyes are only 60 FPS, each \"frame\" for your eye still absorbs all the analog information flooding into your eye during that moment. So if light is changing during that time (i.e., your computer screen jumps from one frame to the next), we essentially get partial information from CPU frames in our \"eye frame\" blended together.\n\nThis creates a motion blur but also registers a lot of information for our brains to make sense of, in terms of motion, speed, etc., just like it would when seeing things move in the real world. So it will feel more natural and meaningful.",

If playing a VRR game, as long as frames are generated consistently over about 80hz I don't really notice the problem.\n\nBut 60 to 100 is night and day.   Which, doesn't surprise me, in the CRT days 60hz was almost intolerable with the flickering.   72hz was far more stable.   So, I know for sure I can perceive more than 60hz.\n\nI think the 240hz thing gets more into latency reduction.  60hz is 16.6ms per frame.   120hz is 8.8.   240 brings it down 4.4.   While you may not perceive visual difference from a 120hz refresh and a 240hz one, you might notice the more instantaneous response to pressing a button, which needs a \"round trip\" of you seeing something, pressing, and then seeing the change.    I think it's kind of like competitive gamers needing the lowest possible latency internet connections, because all of the latencies in the chain add up to where it is perceivable.",

I'm speaking in regards to my experience in audio engineering so I'll use a relevant example that makes sense to me - a microphone will capture soundwaves and generate an electrical current with the same waveform as the sum waveform that the microphone captures. That electrical signal (which will travel to a preamp and run through a series of electronic components until it's either captured via some analog or digital method) is inherently analog but the sound waves that generated it are not. The soundwaves are simply a realworld physical phenomenon all on their own - the analog (which in this case is the electrical signal) is a parallel.\n\n\nThe brain does generate electrical signals based on realworld data it measures, and those signals are certainly analog by definition, simply because the electrical signals are an analog to the realworld data - but the brain is also performing operations that aren't at all analog because some of the things the brain does are things that don't occur outside a brain in the real world, ie engaging in phenomena that has no analog.\n\n\nAn analog is something that is parallel to a source upon which the analog was built - it's not part of a binary choice of existence (analog vs digital)",

The multiple cursors isn't your screen deciding to show multiple cursors it's retinal persistence, it's your eyes and the number/distance of cursors is determined by refresh rate.\n\nThe eye works in a different temporal framework than screens, refresh rates has no meaning for our eyes.\n\nOur eyes works with persistent images that depending on the luminosity \"of pixels\" will persist for longer, this is called retinal persistence. Retinal persistance lasts for about 30-100ms in general, meaning that it's technically impossible for us to distinguish a bright pixels blinking at 30Hz+ and a dimmer pixel that isn't blinking, there is more to this story obviously but we can already see where the 30hz is coming from.\n\nOur eye sensors are ***extremely*** sensitive to light, we can see individual photons, yes individual subatomic light particles, the accuracy of our light detection is unprecedented, at the cost of a less ability to temporally resolve when the light arrived.\n\nHowever retinal persistence combined with our ability to detect individual light particles, means that our eye's strongest point is detecting and processing movement and especially following our own movements, it seems obvious that precise measure of movement is more important in nature, we excel at that.\n\nNow why does it matter for screens and refresh rates, let's take a 500Hz screen, let's have a very small white dot that will cross a black screen in 10 images which means 10 images in 20ms over 30, this is the speed of a fast \"flick shot\" for a sniper in FPS games. how will that look like to a human eye ?\n\n\\--> you guessed right: we'll see 10 small white dots with 3cm spaces\n\nHowever in nature because we'll get photons the entire path of that light source, it'll be a straight line that we'll see, not matter how fast, so long that photons are emitted, we'll see a straight line, and our eyes can see individual photons so anything other than a straight line is quite impossible to achieve.\n\nNow why does it matter ? it matters because our whole ability to process movement is based on retinal persistence, when we have discrete spaced images, our eyes can't process that movement as efficiently as a nice continuous thing, if the images are too far apart in distance between each frames, our eyes/brain simply discard the movement processing and process them as a series of still images (hence headaches when watching action/fast-paced movies in low refresh rates )\n\nSimply put if an object moves fast on your screen, so long that the distance an object move between two frames is greater than our eye's visual accuracy, we'll be able to tell that it's an image from a screen.\n\nEven at 50000Hz our flickshot experiement still shows 0.3mm which albeit small is still above what most people can distinguish when close like we generally are to our gaming monitors.\n\nI'd say that around 100k-500k Hz, there is unlikely any \"normally\" happening movement in a normal setup or game that can be distinguishable from retinal peristance in nature.\n\n***however*** this looks absurd because screens make still images to make us feel movements, if screens were developped to mimic a fake retinal persistence of humans, which will have to be done for each person individually (if that's even possible at some point) then with much lower refresh rates (maybe 50-100hz) screens would be practically undistinguishable from reality to our eyes.\n\nI hope this shed some light to this topic for a least someone",

The amount of time that takes can be correlated to how bright the light is. Brighter lights last longer, meaning at a certain frequency (you mentioned 30Hz+) its impossible to see it discharge enough that it \"turns off\" in our retinas.\n\nconsequently, a dim light constantly on is effectively the same, since its constantly \"charging\" the retina.\n\nThis as a result is why we see multiple of something in motion, such as the mouse example you gave, because in that particular example, the bright white of the mouse stays \"charged\" in our retinas even after its actually moved on. Eventually our eyes \"discharge\" the old image as its no longer receiving it, resulting in it going away after leaving behind a \"ghost\"\n\nRight?",

They can be grouped by cones and rods. Light hits the receptor, some chemical breaks down, raises the level in the cell and at some point it activates the nerve. Then, it regenerates and can do the same again. This takes (depending on many factors and cell type) about 50ms (there are huge differences between types, cones are much faster than rods). So, each nerve can recognize light every 50ms. That's the reason why a fast enough flickering light will be perceived as non flickering. It's usually called  flicker fusion threshold (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker\\_fusion\\_threshold). So, if the frame remains the same, you could flicker the frame at like 60fps and no one would really notice but that only tells half the story. If there is a big contrast between frames, you'll see more \"frames per second\".\n\nThe minimum time a cell needs to activate is about 1-3ms for cones and about 10ms for rods. So, depending on what you're looking at, about 300 to 1000 \"FPS\" is what the eye can see. \n\nGenerally, cones are much faster than rods and important for colors. Rods are more relevant in brightness. \n\nOversimplified: The color contrast between frames the more frames you'll see.",

First is that those signals from activated rods and cones are not synchronized to the time to reconstruct them.  Second, is that the brain is better at interpreting *differences* in the signals rather than the signal itself (like how vision gets weird when you stare at something for too long) which is why humans are still sensitive to thinks like flickering effects at high frequencies.  Third, which really just adds another layer to this rather than points in a specific direction, is that your eyes are always sending a signal to the brain by default and activation of a rod/cone *interrupts* the signal (e.g. black is \"on\" and white is \"off\", this actually has some benefits in noise reduction and is the opposite of how our other sensory perceptions work) so the rate at which individual rods and cones activate isn't directly related to the rate at which we process signals.",

This is why motion blur exists as a feature to help mask the effect. But you wouldn\u2019t need it given a fast enough frame rate.\n\nFor example, say you move an object across your screen at 3 fps in one second, you\u2019ll see the ball on the left of the screen, then in the middle, then on the right with big gaps between.\n\nNow double the fps. You\u2019ll see twice as many balls and half as much of a gap. Increase the fps enough, and you\u2019ll hit every pixel on the screen without missing any. Now you can\u2019t perceive any gaps and it\u2019s just as smooth as if a real ball crossed your vision at that speed.\n\nNow speed it up. Have the ball cross the screen in 0.1 seconds. Now you see gaps again. You\u2019ll need a faster fps to remove those gaps.\n\nTo take this to its logical conclusion, you need an fps fast enough that if an object crossed the entire screen as fast as you could possibly perceive, but still hit every pixel along the way, then you\u2019d never need a faster fps.\n\nI did quick napkin math on this a few years ago, and got approximately 10,000 fps. That\u2019s for a 1080p screen, an object moving diagonally from one corner to the other (the longest possible distance), within the span of the average human\u2019s reaction time which I used as a shorthand for our minimum perception window.",

Eyes and brain does not work this way. But as approximation, values are about 60 physical inputs and about 280 images overall.\n\nAnd I still use 60 FPS monitor, because for casual gamer it is more then enough.
