There are only three manufacturers of gaming chips, Nvidia hasn't given a shit since the 10 series, AMD are now taking advantage of the situation and Intel are still very new in this category. \n\nIdeally the three companies have competitive products at all levels thus making pricing competitive, but the reality is they just found their niche, Nvidia high end, AMD mid/high end and Intel budget/mid end.",

Saw that the 9070xts were kicked back 3 months and I just gave up and got a really good deal on a Aorus Master 3080 for 399. (Barely anything since I had gift money I saved for a GPU.) \n\nI was going to get a XTX, but I got a QD-OLED for 399. I honestly think I enjoy it far more than I would've gotten a GPU with that really rough VA panel I had lol. (They're both 1440p but 240hz on the OLED is crystal clear while the VA had diabolical smearing at only 170.) \n\nI'll just save 2k or so and wait for the UDNA flagship next year or so myself. It's so pointless trying to shop for a GPU right now, and I'm happy with the 3080 + DLSS4. It's not like Nvidia is offering any good value here and makes any extra performance cost more and more. They couldn't even beat the 4070S consistently with the 5070...much less a 4090 lol",

Like I've said before why would they leave money on the table if you know you're still going to buy a new gpu either way? The only way a lot of these companies would go lower is if they got boycotted across the board. On the other end these companies know a lot of people won't buy for that price they're just listing them high to get what they can get before they eventually lower them gradually I just think XFX really dropped the ball and over shot with their pricing and I don't even know how the tariffs play into this for them.",
