Nvidia made DLSS Frame Gen followed by FSR Frame Gen.\n\nIt should be noted that these are not cases where \"Nvidia forced the market to go along with their particular strategy\", but solutions that were already demanded by the wider industry.\n\nBy the 2010s, real-time graphics specialists knew that the end of Moore's Law was drawing closer, and raw rasterised graphics would hit insurmountable limits. Techniques like upscaling or frame interpolation were already seen as necessary to enable long-term improvements in graphics effects, and to keep up with the growing resolutions and frame rates enabled by new display technologies.\n\nAnd ray tracing solves issues that are fundamentally unsolvable with rasterisation. Rasterisation always relies on tricks for reflections and global illumination that are either very limited (pre-baking and light probes), unperformant (like software Lumen), or require significant custom effort to implement (solutions like creating actual mirrored geometry for a mirror image)",

Within 2 generations, upscaling became an incredibly useful tool that made a huge impact on the value of a GPU.\n\nWhile Nvidia's original launch version of DLSS in the RTX 20-series was pretty bad, they made the right call to equip those cards with the necessary hardware. The 20-series has massively improved since then due to software updates. With the 30-series, DLSS had advanced to a state where most people would always use it if they had to compromise between FPS and graphics quality.\n\nMeanwhile the RX 6000 and 7000 series were greatly held back by the lack of a good upscaling solution, which even beefier hardware could not make up for. And now 7900 XTX users still don't have proper upscaling because FSR 4 is exclusive to the 9070-series so far.\n\nRay tracing likewise wasn't great on RTX 2000 yet, but became a significant benefit from the 30-series on and a must-have with the 40 and 50-series.

DLSS is nvidia exclusive, whereas FSR targeted everyone but this meant they couldn't use specific hardware to improve clarity, performance, and stability and this was essentially a bid to get people wanting to upgrade to move over to AMD as it's essentially good will, and now they're going exclusive with FSR 4 which is comparable but serves a different purpose to FSR 3.\n\n\n>While Nvidia's original launch version of DLSS in the RTX 20-series was pretty bad\n\nI'd rather tear my eyes out than use launch DLSS and FSR.\n\n\n\n>For the RX 6000 and 7000 series, the lack of a viable upscaler posed a gigantic disadvantage, which even beefier hardware could not make up for.\n\n....what? FSR is still usable and viable. Its not as good as DLSS due to not using specific hardware but it was a bid to garner goodwill.\n\n\n\n>And now 7900 XTX users still don't have proper upscaling because FSR 4 is exclusive to the 9070-series so far.\n\nThey have proper upscaling called FSR 3. The argument that 7000 series users lose out because AMD have decided they've gone as far as they can with general purpose upscaling isn't a negative, if anything it's a positive the issue is it's also a positive for Nvidia but they can't exactly lock people out without public outcry.\n\n\n>Ray tracing likewise wasn't great on RTX 2000 yet, but became a significant benefit from the 30 series on and now a must-have in the 40/50 gen. And to compete at the high end, path tracing is becoming a mandatory feature.\n\nYes 20 series was shit with RT but everything was then since it was new tech. It's not a \"must-have\" to have ray-tracing be especially performant right now, we're getting there but it's not expected currently and barely any games, especially on Steams current top sellers, that properly implement it. Competition at the high-end is a gamble right now, AMD may be right that the mid-end is the place to be as we've consistently seen Nvidias 60 class GPUs sell well for years with the high-end 80 and 90 class being a fraction of the player base which is understandable due to the increased cost not only from the chips cost perspective but also the taxes, inflation, and upselling.\n\n\n\nTo say AMD doesn't have a viable upscaler is untrue, it serves a different purpose and demographic which unfortunately due to wanting a more general appeal means they can't rely on specific hardware.",

While it still needs higher base resolutions than DLSS and therefore provides less extra performance.\n\nDLSS 3 and FSR 4 were the point at which upscaling artifacts became so infrequent and low-key that upscaling became a widely useful technology. FSR 3 was miles away from that.\n\n>  It's not a \"must-have\" to have ray-tracing be especially performant right now, we're getting there but it's not expected currently and barely any games, especially on Steams current top sellers, that properly implement it.\n\nMost games that don't have ray tracing don't need a current gen GPU to begin with. Solid RT has even arrived in the budget segment since the Intel B580.\n\n> AMD may be right that the mid-end is the place to be as we've consistently seen Nvidias 60 class GPUs sell well for years with the high-end 80 and 90 class being a fraction of the player base\n\nLooking good at the high end also drives interest in the lower range products.\n\nAnd the RTX 4000 cards sold very well at the high end. In the last Steam Hardware Surveys, 4070Ti, 4080, and 4090 added up to the same ~5% share as the 4060. While the *only* RX 7000 cards that made the cut were the 7900 XTX (0.43%) and 7700 XT (0.2%).",

Never had problems with AMD drivers.\n\nBeen with Nvidia since then (2015) and with new cards there was always some hiccups in the start. I would say there has been some major driver issue at least once a year for the last 10 years which often required rollback to fix and then not upgrading driver for a couple months.\n\nSince I bought the 9070 I have yet to face any issues.

Presumably they refer to sales since the launch of the 9070 cards, or a one-month window or something like that.\n\nOf course the 9070-series had a great start. AMD built up a stockpile for months and released it into a market with a huge GPU shortage, while Nvidia cards have been trickling from the factories straight to customers. But it will take a sustained supply and much more time to greatly change the overall market share.\n\nAt least from what I've seen among Japanese streamers, Nvidia was just as dominant in Japan as everywhere else for the past few years. I've seen a lot of Nvidia 10/20/30 series, nowadays a lot of 4080 and 4090. I've seen a single 7900 XTX between maybe 10-15 systems. Maybe streamers put up more money or chose Nvidia specifically for the better video encoding, but it seems more likely to me that the 45% figure is way off.",
