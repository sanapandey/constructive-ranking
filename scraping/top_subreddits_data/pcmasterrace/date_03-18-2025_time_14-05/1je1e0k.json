Certainly nothing that supports it is going to have trouble with 1080p.\n\nI'd be willing to bet what they were actually dealing with is [chroma subsampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling).\n\nWiki has all the details, but the tl;dr version is that it's common in the video world to sample color at a reduced resolution compared to brightness to reduce the storage and bandwidth (analog or digital) requirements, and for most video applications it's hard to see the difference without studying a static image or generating a test pattern containing a lot of single pixel lines or subpixel details.  Basically every video distribution format uses it for this reason, and as a result a lot of TVs will default to negotiating subsampled modes and some don't even offer a way to force them to do otherwise.\n\nThis was fine until people started hooking their PCs up to their TVs and wanting to do more than just play games or watch movies, as a computer desktop is basically a worst case scenario for subsampling with all sorts of single-pixel lines and subpixel rendering of details like smooth fonts.\n\nSome TVs will assume HDMI inputs are video devices and DVI or VGA inputs are PCs, some TVs require manual mode selection, some TVs require silly things like naming the input \"PC\", etc.",

Since the human visual system is much more sensitive to variations in brightness than color, a video system can be optimized by devoting more bandwidth to the luma component (usually denoted Y'), than to the color difference components Cb and Cr. In compressed images, for example, the 4:2:2 Y'CbCr scheme requires two-thirds the bandwidth of non-subsampled \"4:4:4\" R'G'B'. This reduction results in almost no visual difference as perceived by the viewer. \n\nGranted, that's contradicted by the parts further down which you quoted, but only because they were obviously written by someone who doesn't understand that subsampling is lossy compression. A simple google search will turn up plenty of authoritative sources which refer to chroma subsampling as [chroma compression](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22chroma+compression%22).",

They may all have different features, but they're still able to be used on various devices.  \n  \nAlso, please no one go off about lightning being an example ffs. Lightning was invented because the USB-IF were dragging their feet on finalising and releasing USB-C. Apple are part of USB-IF and were pushing for USB-C so they could use it in their phones but the release wasn't even in sight. They created lightning and then the USB-iF got their shit together to finally release USB-C because apple started making their own",

But, usbc isn't really designed for the same things military stuff is. A military grade usbc system wouldn't look much like what we usually have, especially if it's mean for something like a radio. It'd need further ruggedizing and waterproofing",

Thunderbolt is a protocol.  SDI, XLR, CON are connecotors designed to support different types of video, audio, or rf transmission in much the same way that USB-C is capable of different types of data and power transmission.  It would be terrible standard if we were forced to move to a new physical form factor every time the underlying protocol changed.",

BUT it should 100% be a requirement.  The shitty thing is that there's so much that's optional that even if they tried to write it on the head of the cable, there's not enough space.

That prong inside the female port is very prone to damage since it's so thin, and you have tiny gaps around the prong in the female port and inside the male port, where dirt can get stuck.\n\nIt makes no sense to me that they didn't just take the lightning design and add some conductors and a better protocol. The lightning female port has a much wider gap, so dirt doesn't get stuck as easily, and it's easier to clean since you don't have to worry about the little fragile prong that usb has, and the male port has no holes at all.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do not like Apple.

Instead the forces are applied to the outside where there are no electric connectors.\n\nLightning connector also is probably designed to break at a certain point, but pressure applied will apply it on the sides with electric connectors.",

But largely, damage to the pins was never an issue with Lightning, and continues to not be an issue with USB-C.  Devices being dropped and taking hits and pulls to the plug are significantly more common, and with USB-C that can mean breaking the male side.\n\nWith Lightning, when that happened it was simply a pair of tweezers to extract the broken connector from the device, and a new cable.

Those things retain some serious heat. \n\nMy battery (and, car!) were fine... but, the drive home with the dead-battery guy that torched his own truck was extremely silent and awkward.",

Great piece of hardware imo.\n\nYeah, this is I think is capped at 125W. The plug shouldn't get too hot since that's usually a result of higher current which the 240W mode avoids by stepping the voltage up to 48V to maintain the ~5A limit of the cables.\n\nDefinitely, the caldigit is powered by a barrel connector haha. But it's now only a single cable I have to connect/disconnect to get my whole desktop (well, laptop) environment docked which I like since I travel a good amount for work.\n\nYou're definitely right, USB-C in industrial settings isn't super common (nor should it be really) but it does happen so this is a happy middle ground to safely and securely use that connector. I've had similar experiences with RS-485 and ribbon cables... like why am I even considering buying them for personal use lol\n\nTo top this all off, I don't think the 240W thing with locking should pop up every where. It's just one solution of many for specific applications, and this change/support allows for it to go beyond what it was initially designed for.",
