Bonus points if I threw the blanket into the dryer beforehand for extra toasty. If it is a good thick comfortor or a good sleeping bag, you can keep your hands nice and toasty. It's the nose and ears that bother me most.\n\n If it is a game that uses a  keyboard, like a shooter,  I use a pair of  gloves that I can squeeze hand warmers into when the gloves stop holding body heat in (though that is only for exceptionally long sessions, I'm talking full day off binges). \n\n\nGenerally though, since my pc is quite large and poorly maintained, it puts off a LOT of heat.

Just like having the panel open doesn't make it produce more heat, it also doesn't produce less. \n\nAlso it won't actually equalize with the room faster, because this model disregards the existence of fans and the concept of airflow through the case. The solution that replaces the air inside the case faster will keep the system cooler, and opening the case will hinder that goal. That's a whole other discussion though.",

That does not mean it's **producing** more heat, it's just reaching a higher temperature because it isn't dissipating it as quickly. The amount of heat it produces depends on its load. Hot air doesn't magically make the electrical processes on the chip create more heat. \n\n>By having each component cooling itself with room temp air \n\nThis is why you want to close the case, and run the fans. By replacing the air inside the case with room temperature air many times an hour, you keep the air hitting your heatsinks room temperature. Opening a case kills the airflow and means that the air around the components will be able to get and stay hotter. Again, that's beside the point of how the physics of why computers produce heat works, but it's relevant to the choice to use a side panel. \n\n>condenses\n\nThis word does not mean what you think it means. Heat dissipates, and in this context has nothing to do with the phase change of matter from a gas to a liquid.",

The front of the PC is towards the right side of OP's image.\n\nDo not put the tempered glass near anything that is harder than it. So keep it away from ceramics! Tiled floors are usualy the culprit for ruined glass side panels. One small bump or even a scratch on the edge of the glass can cause it to fracture.",
