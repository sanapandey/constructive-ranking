Someone made a render before of this and a user commented on how one cable fuse shorting would lead to a cascade fuses blowing and cutting all power to the card meaning it is passive safe. If someone could find the post again I would edit to give credit where it is due. \n\nI also thought about using 15 amp fuses (fuses are dirt cheap) but wanted to do some validation testing first, I checked with an ohmeter and it barely registers resistance.\n\nEDIT: here we go \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/s/Gk56OYB8Nn](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/s/Gk56OYB8Nn)\n\nI can't test the cable yet. I am currently building a SFF PC for a client that just backed out so if anyone wants a 9070XT, 7800X3D in an NR200P case let me know.",

Connecting or disconnecting 8-pins from the adapter changes the state of the sense pins and tells the GPU how much it's allowed to draw. Your PSU will have the same sort of thing going on internally if you have a native 12VHPWR setup.\n\nThe sense pins can't save the connector from failure. That's the job of the GPU to balance its load across the parallel conductors it's pulling power from. The GPU can be well under the rated limits and still fail, meaning it can be within what the sense pins will allow and fail. The connector doesn't care how much current goes through each pin, but each is rated to about 9.5A max. It's the job of the GPU to not exceed that, and the designs we have seen on pretty much every use of the connector give the GPU no chance to do that.",

Once that fuse rating is passed that wire is no longer usable and the rest of the wires have to take the load, exacerbating the problem like the above comment.
