    "selftext": "What is the kindest way to break it off with a woman who appears to have serious substance abuse issues? We have been together 7 months and I feel she has been hiding her \"true self\" from me, but I have now seen behind the veil enough to know I want no part of this relationship. \n\nWithout getting into all the details, I have not been happy in this relationship for a number of reasons. I think it's all come to a head with this latest revelation. She is on vacation with friends and she has been absolutely hammered 4 straight nights in a row. I'm not talking tipsy, I'm talking marbles in the mouth, slurring, making no sense and talking gibberish when she calls me at night. \n\nI know better than to bring any of this up while she is in the middle of the vacation. But last night she took it to a new level. She was already slurring but then really started to fade and nod off. I asked her if she'd be honest with me and she said yes. I asked, did you take something? She said yes. I asked her what and she said \"Xanax.\" This was after she was already shitfaced drunk. \n\nAs the conversation wore on, she was making no sense and I told her she should get some sleep and we hung up. I was terrified for her well-being. I'm honestly scared she could die down there. I did not sleep well. I don't know what to do here. Any suggestions?\n\n",
