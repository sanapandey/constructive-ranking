    "selftext": "My boyfriend (25M) and I (22F) live only 2 minutes apart by car and 10 minutes on foot, yet he never makes the effort to meet up with me. I\u2019m a more spontaneous person, but he is overly planned, to the point where it feels obsessive. Our relationship is built on mutual respect for personal space\u2014I make time for my friends, school, family, and hobbies. However, I always make sure to dedicate time to him as well; in fact, I even prioritize him at times. But he doesn\u2019t do the same.\n\nIf we lived farther apart, I would understand, but we don\u2019t. Plus, we both stay up late, so once he\u2019s done with everything he needs to do during the day, I feel like he could spontaneously say, \u201cLet\u2019s grab a coffee,\u201d and we could actually do that. I don\u2019t understand why we only see each other once a week. Is this normal? If not why is he acting this way?",
