    "selftext": "Long story short, me (28F) and my Husband (25M) have been together 5 years, married for 1 year. We do have a Baby together (2F). I found out last month that he\u2019s been cheating the entirety of the relationship. From what he\u2019s told me(and what little I\u2019ve seen), physical cheating has only happened once, the rest is sexting/texting, dating apps, alt social media accounts. I was ready to leave honestly, but when he broke down I couldn\u2019t. He mentioned wanting to try therapy (he\u2019s traumatized from childhood therapy and won\u2019t go into details about it, but he suggested it anyways) and I agreed to stay and try to work on building our relationship and trust back up.\n\nAnyways, my emotions are quite literally everywhere. I\u2019ll be fine one minute and then the next I\u2019m crying, angry, shutting down. I\u2019m also struggling with being extremely in the mood? Like I look at him and get all the emotions and it\u2019s like I get hit with just wanting to jump his bones. I\u2019ve been turned down soooo much. I don\u2019t understand.\n\nWe can\u2019t really afford therapy right now until he starts his new job which will be MAYBE another month once they call him. I\u2019m really struggling I\u2019m not going to lie. I\u2019ve sacrificed dreams for him, I\u2019m working full time, have our baby full time (she comes with me, I\u2019m thankful for that), taking care of the house, cooking, and paying half the bills. It\u2019s never really bothered me before until this situation happened. Now I\u2019m just frustrated all the time because I can never really get an answer to \u201cwhy\u201d.\n\nI have never cheated on him or even thought of being with another man. I get physically sick thinking about it. I\u2019m SO confused. I do get a lot of \u201cfriends\u201d telling me to get even but from watching other people I know that doesn\u2019t help and I cannot even fathom traumatizing someone that way. I don\u2019t really want to leave. I want the family I\u2019ve always dreamed of having and he says he does too.\n\nHow do I get a real reason \u201cwhy\u201d from him? How do I communicate with someone who doesn\u2019t know or like being open due to trauma?",

They naturally tend to be attracted to more than one person at a time, and can romantically love two or more people at once. Your husband is a non-monogamous person.\n\nThis wiring is likely genetic or inherent. You can't control it, and suddenly become okay with sharing your partner, your husband can't stop it and suddenly become okay with only having one partner. You are monogamous, he is not, you two are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nHOWEVER. This does NOT, does NOT, does NOT excuse your husband's cheating. Non-monogamous does not mean cheater, nor does it mean \"well, he was born that way, so it's okay and I have to forgive him,\" No. That's bs.\n\nCheating, is breaking the mutually agreed upon rules of the relationship. The rules of your relationship included exclusivity, with no other sexual or romantic partners- and he broke that rule. That shows a fundamental lack of respect for you, and for your relationship. \n\nThere are MANY other ethical ways that a non-monogamous person can conduct themselves: they can be honest about being non-monogamous on the first date, and let you make an informed decision about compatibility, they can be with someone who is open to a non-monogamous relationship, they can negotiate boundaries and stay within them, they can leave the relationship if they are unable to tolerate a monogamous lifestyle... All of that would be okay.\n\nLying to you, and cheating on you, is not okay.\n\nBut if you want a clear, simple \"why,\" there it is. He's not monogamous.",

You didn't want kids but now he's trapped you with the very thing you never wanted. He can cheat and you will stay because of the baby (in his mind at least). It wouldn't surprise me if he pretended to not want kids either until you were married which is also a common entrapment technique.\n\nAlso does he help out around he house at all? It seems from your post that you do all the child care, cooking, cleaning and the sole breadwinner? He's got himself a maid too \ud83d\ude2d\n\nETA: I re read the post and see you got married post baby but not gonna change what I wrote",

There are subs on reddit that help with that too. I think it is crap, the relationship is permanently different once someone cheats.\n\nFixating on the why isn't going to do much. You may get the full answer from him, and it won't be enough. You may get the full answer and it may hurt you more than if you didn't know.\n\nWhat you need to know is that the value he gave you was so little that he cheated on you your whole relationship and while cheating had a child with you. Now it is on you to muster the self respect to leave someone who values you so little, and work on yourself to question why you are still with this person.",

About80% of that 20% get a divorce because the other partner usually wife found out. \n\nSo you decided to stay married. For whatever reason reason doesn\u2019t matter, you need to be very realistic not dumb like this is something you can manage but realistic on what this all means. \n\nLet\u2019s get into it. \n\n1) you have zero reason to trust him again. The formula for a relationship is trust+respect=love with no trust, no respect there is no love. Deep down you know this, you know it\u2019s a loss and you are now grieving. \n\n2) in order to be able to reget any of that back, you will need a very very strong support system. Already he manipulated you into staying. The whole \u201c crying melt down\u201d very typical reaction and most women with empathy fall for it. The thing is he\u2019s not the victim you are. So you have a lot to learn. 1) what\u2019s his tail when he\u2019s lying? 2) if he can become a victim from his wrong behavior and actions what does that make you to him? His savior or an escape from his wrong behavior?\n\n3) forgiveness is a very lengthy process. Going to a therapist is very much needed to entirely for you, but for him. He showed you that he can\u2019t communicate, and that he would act on disrespecting you along with self Sabotage behaviors that for 5 years is a very long time to have. This form of habit means he\u2019s never been radically honest to you. With out a professional to actually help him, he won\u2019t ever figure this out. \n\n4) while you think \u201c I took him back, he owes you\u201d it\u2019s all nonesense unless he gets serious help and relearns how to be honest, he will cheat, or have an affair again. This is the risk you just accept going forward. It\u2019s not a \u201c fool me once shame on you but fool me twice shame on me\u201d for nothing. This means you risk having this repeated, because he hasn\u2019t learned or been on his own to know how to maintain the respect in the relationship and like a toddler will most likely do it again. This is why it\u2019s a bit above your head. \n\n5)Not your fault. Taking radical honesty , means they look you in the eye and tell you every detail. Not going to Reddit and asking why he cheated. Going to your husband and asking why he cheated, how he cheated and really getting down the truth. If you walk away, skimp, let him off the hook, give empathy or he just plays the victim he will never learn this important part of what cheaters and infidelity need to learn. Talking and being radically honest is very difficult. This also means him stating HE cheated, he hurt you, he did this and caused a rift in your life. That\u2019s taking responsibility that you cannot take for him. Again if he can\u2019t he will do it again. \n\n6) resentment; although right now it\u2019s fresh new and way to soon. Resentment and anger will grow and the change will be showing in the relationship and this is the burden of what people take on when they stay. So understand that it\u2019s normal, it\u2019s also why you will now have to go to a therapist. Again not that you did this but he did. So now you also have to heal. If you don\u2019t the resentment will end your love or affection or any kind of ability to have a healthy trust. Now he doesn\u2019t deserve it yet but if he actually did the work in 4-5 years maybe he will. \n\nYes it does take some serious time, no it\u2019s not for everyone which is why most leave and if you did look at the bigger picture leaving would make alot of sense. You have a right to a peace of mind just as much as he does. You also don\u2019t have to be in a cheating or affair marriage. \n\nYou will have to work through it and go over the process If you stay and this means he will have to do a lot to bring in stability and security again to you. So understand this is going to be a process and change for you both. Good luck in therapy I hope he does take it seriously and don\u2019t let him play a victim for his actions. Even in high emotions it gives him zero right to ask anything from or of you. It\u2019s his behavior not yours that needs to change.",

But it\u2019s so hard when you\u2019ve given someone you\u2019re all and they cheat. Wishing you all the best.",

He probably, regularly steps out on you but is using this where he can use your SELF as a scapegoat because you were pregnant and hormonial.

Take it from someone who also never got her \"why\" answered, and this comes with the years of wisdom and reflection nearly two decades after the abusive relationship ended.     \n    \nFirst, there is no answer to your \"why\" in this world or any other that will heal or rationalize the hurt, betrayal, and mistrust you are feeling and will feel for a long time. Besides, he lied to you over and over again before, during, and after any cheating he did. Why would he for ONCE do the decent thing and tell you the ACTUAL truth, especially when it serves him the least? And also, how could you EVER trust him not to be lying to you every time you ask him anything?    \n    \nNo reason or explanation he could give you will make what he did forgiveable, understandable, or justifiable, so save yourself the hurt, and start getting the help you need to start the healing process for you to get to the place you need to be, which is that no matter what he says, you did nothing wrong, you WERE nothing wrong, you didn't deserve what he did, he did this TO YOU. You are and always will be a VICTIM of his choices.    \n    \nNext, this is more like post-mortem advice, if that makes sense. Having an insecurity problem in your next relationships as a response to infidelity is perfectly normal, however, try to get out in front of it as much as possible. My go-to discussion with my partners was, \"Hey, for a good while, I'm probably going to need more reassurance than you think is reasonable until I feel safe trusting someone again. I try my best to give everyone a clean slate until they mess up, but I'm only human. All I can do is promise to try my best not to make you pay the bill for what someone else did to me. And I will ask for your patience and understanding while I try to navigate this. If that's too much this early, I get it. But if you're willing to tough it out with me, it would mean a lot.\"    \n   \nNever had a guy complain that it was too much work. They liked having the heads-up and knowing where my mind was at without getting caught off guard or having some crazy jealous girlfriend appear out of nowhere. If I acted insecure, they gently pointed it out, reminded me that they were expecting it and they weren't mad, and let me get out of my own head about it.
