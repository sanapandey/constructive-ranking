    "selftext": "We\u2019ve been together for a few months, and I\u2019m her first. I love focusing on my partner, so she has been very satisfied with sex. However, for the past several weeks, she\u2019s been really busy and tired, and we haven\u2019t had sex in over a month.\n\nEvery 1-2 days, I ask if she wants to go somewhere to be intimate. When she says no, I always respond with, \u201cOkay, no problem, love,\u201d and I genuinely mean it\u2014I don\u2019t show disappointment or pressure her in any way. I respect her boundaries, and I\u2019m completely fine with \u201cno\u201d as an answer.\n\nRecently, she got frustrated and said, \u201cWhy do you keep asking when you know the answer is no? I\u2019m busy and tired.\u201d I replied, \u201cI\u2019m always okay with you declining, but managing your emotions on top of mine isn\u2019t my responsibility. You need to be able to say no comfortably, just as my emotions are as important as yours.\u201d She called me insensitive, and I didn\u2019t know how to respond, so I just went silent.\n\nI don\u2019t want to pressure her, and I always respect her space. But at the same time, I feel like I\u2019m in a tough spot\u2014if I don\u2019t ask at all, it feels like suppressing my needs, but asking seems to annoy her. Any advice and perspectives are well appreciated.\n\nUpdate: \n- We are very intimate on each other at every spot we find without people, sending nudes, kissing etc. (She initiates a good portion)\n- We live with families so spontaneous sex is not possible we need to go to a hotel (Short trips as she has no time)\n- We are constantly going to dates every free time we find. We are very affectionate and loving to each other.\n- I\u2019m going to her work place as she couldnt find time to come to dates, help her, massage her when she is tired, study next to her even though I dont need it.\n- I never said a word anytime she cancels a plan and always said your work and school are your first priorities dont worry.\n- Trying to make group plans with her friends so she feels she does not feel like neglecting them, if she cancels our plans for them I say its okay we have our time dont worry.\n- I started asking regularly this last week after 3-4 dry weeks.",

I do not believe most men see their partner that way either.\n\n\nIf they had been together longer, my answer would be different, but it has literally been 2 to 3 months and one of those months was sexless. That is when the average couple should be having the *most* sex. Being \"too busy and tired\" for sex at this stage is very abnormal and if OP places that much importance on sex, it will be worse for him in 6 months.\n\n\nI will admit, I didn't read the update part where he said they need to book a hotel room to have sex, which may play a huge role. At the end of the day, though, that isn't sustainable either unless one of them is a multi-millionaire or they are willing to get risky and creative. Sooo...I would still say it isn't going to work. Ending it now is the best choice while the emotional investment is minimal.",

Well, that could be her normal for all he knows, and even if it isn't, they barely know eachother. It just isn't worth working out unless he is so madly in love with her he wants to make it work. How long does he wait for someone he hasn't invested very much time in? I certainly wouldn't be sticking around and I don't have a high libido. Now if my partner who I have been with for five years started being too 'busy and tired' for sex, of course I would be much more patient and give him time and work on working it out for quite awhile before we started to have serious talks about our relationship status.",

Failing to say yes to you may make her afraid she's upsetting you and you're just saying it's ok.  You may know that's not the case, but we're talking about emotions and sex; there's not a lot of logic happening here.  \n\nHave a talk with her about this. Ask her what this situation makes her feel and why. Then, shut up and let her answer fully. Don't try to fix anything, just listen to her.  It may help to give her a chance to vent and emo-dump and feel heard. This may not get you sex, but it will definitely get you intimacy. You're giving her a chance to be real and honest and vulnerable with you. If you show love and acceptance and respect, it'll go a long way towards making her feel better.   Then, at the end of the day, instead of carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders and feeling like she's disappointing you and risking losing you,  she'll feel supported like you're helping her carry her burden with her and she can trust and rely on you.\n\nIf she feels you're the supportive, trustworthy, safe, and reliable bf that she can be relaxed and vulnerable with, she's likely to feel way more randy when given the opportunity.\n\nI heard a sex therapist phrase it as: \"Communication is lubrication.\"",

Can you do more around the house, like clean, laundry, dishes, cooking, etc.?\n\nSometimes it has a lot to do with the mental load of things. Right now, you're putting the mental load of intimacy on her.\n\nOnce you've exhausted all the ways you can help remove stress without asking her. Then, sit down and ask how else you can help. It might be helpful to make a list of the items you've taken on to help out so she can add anything to that list. I'm a list person so if she isn't, this might set her off.\n\nI'm not saying you aren't doing your part either, I'm just trying to think of all the possibilities.\n\nSex is important as is intimacy that's non-sexual. Does she feel like she only gets the intimacy if it's in the form of sex? That could also be a factor here.\n\nI don't think you asking for sex and taking the no is wrong, but the frequency might be the real issue. It's hard to say without her side of it.\n\nJust know that if your sexual needs aren't being met and you are no longer sexually compatible, it's okay to break up over that. I'm not saying you should, just that it's a valid reason because sex is important and that's okay.\n\nWhen it's stressful in my family, I wear a certain item of clothing to signal that I'm game for sexual advances. These are talked about beforehand and we both fully understand. It can be kind of fun too, I don't always know when he will take me up on the offer so to speak lol.\n\nI hope you both can work this out.\n\nEDIT: \n\nSince there are far too many people who don't get this. \n\nYou can help out SOs and friends who don't live with you. If they are stressed or having MH issues, you can help them clean, cook, laundry, meal prep, etc. It's okay to show those in your life you love and care for them with actions. It doesn't make you wear or a pushover or any other negative thing. \n\nSometimes people need help in life and that's okay. \n\nI will go to my friends places and help out when they are super stressed or just not in a good mental health space. I didn't grow up with this, it's something I learned and do for those I care about. \n\nI get not everyone is like this and that's okay, but don't vilify those who are.",

They've only been together a few months, and not only do they not live together, they both live in family homes.

He's literally *not* putting the \"mental load of intimacy\" on her, which would imply that he's leaving it to her to take the initiative and lead on all things intimate between them.

It is a good policy to ask beforehand, and if you communicated to your partner that you do not want to make more decisions and to make his own judgement calls, that is good. You communicated that and now he can start doing that.",

I also wasn\u2019t keeping in mind in that moment that they didn\u2019t live together. The point still stands that if he wants his girlfriend to be more sexually available in this super stressful time, he has to help remove stressors from her life so she can be sexually available. It\u2019s absolutely wild how you see taking care of your partner as being something that just equates to neglecting oneself and doing something for someone and getting no gain. Scary, actually. I really like how you had to intentionally mischaracterize absolutely everything I said and then make some wild assumptions and accusations to make your argument. How embarrassing.",

Sometimes he\u2019ll bring me take out dinner or cook dinner so I don\u2019t even have to think about that even if I meal prepped and it would be \u201ceasy\u201d, even though we usually switch off who cooks and cleans he\u2019ll take on cleaning as well even if he cooked, he\u2019ll tidy up the place, he\u2019ll take my dog for a walk or play with him to get extra energy out of him so I can relax or do whatever I want with the little time I have left for the day. My boyfriend and I talked about these things at first, and every once in a while check in to see if anything has changed and how we\u2019re feeling, but he\u2019s not asking me every time he comes over what he can do to help, he knows things that I\u2019m ok with him doing (and appreciate it so much) and just does it so the little time im not working during the day I can fully focus on him or myself if we\u2019re not hanging out that day. \n\nObviously OP can\u2019t help with work if that\u2019s what stressing her out, but there are definitely things he can do even though they don\u2019t live together.",

I wouldn\u2019t call you insensitive, because I\u2019m 40 and a man, and I just figured this out a few years ago. \n\nSo my advice is to stop asking for sex and instead ask what you can do to help her relax. She\u2019s busy and stressed, so I\u2019m not surprised your well intentioned and normally very reasonable asks are just building pressure. Take up more of the household chores, asks if there\u2019s something she\u2019d like to do on her day off. Or just give her the space to come to you. I would drop all requests for sex for a while, and give her time to come to you on her own terms.",

Sickness, kids, high stress etc. Thats normal and reasonable. But we are talking a seasoned relationship. The honey moon period of any relationship is like 6 month to a year and thats when you fuck each other brains out and after that it reduces down to a more reasonable maintainabke level. Note I said red7ced not flat put die. You went from lots of sex to no sex in less than a year. O call bullshit.\n\nI recently saw a video in regards to sex and monogamy that I though was spot on. So you want monogamy (I do) ok I commit to monogamy. Ok great but if you take sex out of a monoganous relationship then that isnt fair is it. The contract was sex exclusivity with one person. No sex at all is a different contract as in you signed up for a monogamous relationship, NOT!!!a selibacy relationship. You joined a relationship bot a monastery.",

So yeah ask, what\u2019s your ideal sexual life/routine, how do you like sex initiated, and why do you want to have sex or like having sex to yourself and her, and potentially you can come to a place where you have understanding of what you want sexually.\n\nFor example, I find it strange you can\u2019t have sex at family houses. As someone who lives at home, as does my partner, we just do it in our bedrooms. Granted my partner is a twin who shared a room for awhile so we had to be more creative then, but \u201cgetting a hotel\u201d every time sounds like a load of work, and is probably adding to the stress and pressure that your girlfriend feels. Even like car sex is an option, but in the situation you\u2019re currently in now I think (if your relationship is gonna continue, and no guarantee about that) you should discuss how to make having sex easier and less stressful than having to have a mini-vacation. Turns it from an hour exercise into an all night/half a day exercise and she might feel, (correctly) that she doesn\u2019t have time for that.\n\nI think inherent to the conversation you have too is yeah a conversation about initiation, cuz when there\u2019s no conversation there you end up in situations like this where it\u2019s easy for people to feel pressured, rejected, unheard, etc. so definitely talk about (and ask yourself) how you want to initiate sex and what makes you feel loved, cared for, seen and respected. (Universal you here, so you AND her, obvioisly).\n\nLast thing, sex is about pleasure, not performance. I don\u2019t know you so this could be totally off base but sometimes \u201cfocusing on partner\u2019s pleasure\u201d can also come with a pressure for the partner to perform said pleasure to you that adds pressure or emotional difficulty to sex. Focusing on just the pleasure of sex and non-penetrative acts of intimacy, rather than things with the goal of orgasm (or multiple orgasms) or a pressure to perform enjoyment can sometimes take pressure off of sex for people, and again that goes both ways. \n\nHope this and the other comments help, good luck OP!!",

Chickens need eggs and eggs need chickens, but to be a healthy function man you don't need validation.\n\n\"I'm insecure/lack confidence because my partner rejected me too many times\" is simply another way of saying \"I'm currently struggling with my insecurities/lack of confidence because my partner no longer provides the validation that I was dependent upon\". If someone takes away something you don't need and really don't pay attention to, in this case validation, it doesn't have a negative impact on you. Meaning the insecurities and lack of self confidence left the chat before these guys partners lost interest.\n\nEven if that weren't true, but I don't think there is a way to argue it isn't, why choose to maintain mindsets and repeat actions that are causing yourself frustration and are even possibly interfering with you developing the types of relationships you desire?\n\nThe answer is again validation\n\nIf you are being rejected by your partner regularly you would have to be a narcissist to not assume you yourself aren't a big part of the reason why they are rejecting you, because if you believe you aren't part of the reason why they aren't having sex with you that means you believe your partner is intentionally not having sex THEY want to have.\n\nThe funny thing is most of these men who proposition their partners without consideration of their partner or other context of the moment often also believe their partner isn't all that into them...  people ignore all these indications of why that specific moment and the way they approach it is more likely to fail not because they have expectations or needs, they do so because they are simply seeking validation, and if they end up having sex in spite of all the reasons that was unlikely in that moment it only increases the validation.\n\nJust like sex isn't a need validation isn't a need. There certainly are people who are dependent on these things, that doesn't make them a need.

Your balls will not explode, I promise you. Then have a talk with her about intimacy; please remember that this talk should not involve you asking to fuck her and you should not expect it to lead immediately to sex. Talk about how you both can COMPROMISE on how often you have sex and what she needs to make it enjoyable for her.\n\nYou can dump this one, but your shit is going to be a problem in every relationship you get into. Sometimes couples go through dry spells. Sometimes whoever you're with will have too much going on to want sex. At some point - prepare to be astonished and disbelieving - even *you* might be too tired, busy, and annoyed to want to have sex, possibly for many days on end. Good partners take it in stride, communicate, and get through it. Bad partners whine for sex from their tired, busy, and annoyed partner on the daily. Which one do you want to be?",

And it\u2019s fair to end a relationship if you don\u2019t get those things, or to communicate to your partner that you need them in a relationship.\n\nFirst off not expecting sex is not the same as settling for a sexless relationship\n\nNext expecting sex in a relationship is expecting your partner to desire you unconditionally, that is not how desire works and very few people are narcissistic enough to truly believe that.... but lots of people still think expecting sex, and usually not just any sex but mutually enthusiastic sex, is reasonable.\n\n>Staying in a relationship that someone else has voluntarily made sexless is not for me.\n\nThis continues the idea that if you expect sex you believe you are gods gift to women. I'm not talking about top 1% here, but the one and only.\n\nA lack of sex has to be a voluntary choice on the woman's part, or that is the most obvious choice because it is laughable to consider you did anything that was less than extremely desirable ever, and ridiculous to consider that external stressors could ever compete with your raw sexual energy.\n\nThis is such false bravado. People treat sex this way because they want the validation that comes from being able to feel like you are so damn sexy that you can just assume your girl wants you without you having to consider her feelings, her mood, or external stressors in that moment.\n\nAnother way to say the same thing: This is an approach you see a lot of insecure people use because if your partner is enthusiastically having sex with you in spite of the way you approach them and sex in general there obviously has to be something pretty damn desirable about you even if you have no clue yourself what that actually is. Let's not ignore the fact their desire is present in spite of your undesirable actions.\n\nAdditionally the expectation of sex is always tied to other expectations. I've never seen a situation where someone expected sex simply because they were in a relationship even when they claim it is a reasonable expectation, its always transactional and manipulative.\n\n>Sex is not an add-on, it\u2019s a need.\n\nSex isn't a need, it is a want, and if you believed it was even half as important as a true need why would you continue to do things that make it more difficult to come by?\n\nPart of the answer to that question I already covered, if sex is harder to come by the sex and attention you get provides greater validation. But other than that whats the fuckin point? There isn't one right? Why act in a manner that doesn't align with who you are, treat people in a manner that doesn't align with your true feelings, and do things that make what you really want more difficult to come by?\n\nTreating sex as a need and/or reasonable expectation does all of that\n\nIf frequent sex is extremely important to you and you also want a long term commitment it is in your best interest to not treat sex as a need or expectation, and recognize that if someone who once had strong desire for you no longer is showing the same desire that is likely a lot to do with you. It isn't them making a choice to ignore how much they want you.",

Did you have that conversation, or did you just wait 3-4 weeks and then start hassling her for sex every day?\n\nYou want to understand her emotions? Here they are. Women get pressured for sex *a lot*. I don't know where you live that it's common for people in their mid-20s to still live at home, but I can almost guarantee you that that society sends women plenty of messages that sex is all they're good for. If you count having a strange man grab your boobs, your ass, or between your legs as sexual assault, the odds are *very* high that your girlfriend has been sexually assaulted in that way at least once. It can make us very sensitive to the implication that the only thing a man wants out of us is sex, even if we like having sex with that man.\n\nNow, enter your girlfriend stage left. She's tired. She's busy. She knows that you know she's busy because she tells you about whatever's making her busy, and she knows that you know she's tired because you are presumably not blind. She comes home from work, she's beat and just wants to veg in front of the TV, and here you come all \"Hey, you want to put your shoes on again and go out and check into a motel and have to bring your things into the motel and maybe skip dinner to have sex with me?\"\n\nNo. She does not want to. Because she is tired and hungry and has many other things to worry about. Which you know. So she says \"No, because I'm tired and busy,\" with the understanding (apparently incorrect) that you will fill in the blank spots where she would have said \"...and that makes me not want to have sex. At some other time, when I am not tired and busy, I will want to have sex again.\"\n\nShe thinks you're okay with that. She thinks that you will pay attention to her state of fatigue and what is going on in her life and use that information to figure out when would be a good time to invite her to a motel for, well, motel sex. She is wrong.\n\nThe next day, she is still tired and busy and doesn't want to take time out of her life to go to a damn motel for *any* reason. She knows that you know both these things. And yet here you come, all \"Hey, you want to put your shoes on again and go out and check into a motel and have to bring your things into the motel and maybe skip dinner to have sex with me?\"\n\nDay. After. Day. After. Day. You're not hearing her that she is TIRED and BUSY and can you PLEASE JUST WAIT for a day when she's not tired and busy? Sex starts to look like one more fucking chore. *You* start to look like someone who's doing all the things you do because they will allow you to get your dick wet. She is now frustrated, with you and with her life, and every time you ask her to leave wherever she's comfortable and resting and go find a damn motel - and she's probably getting sick of motels, too - it makes her vagina resemble the Sahara Desert just a little bit more.\n\nIf you want to have sex with her again, you're going to have to be an adult and have the conversation. Or break up with her. But quit nagging her or you're never going to have sex with her again.",

Give her some space to vent.\n\nAnd if it doesn't help in the long run - start talking about it. About it means what's going on her mind, not strictly about her libido.\n\nAnd if after that she's giving you some shady answers - start thinking about things she wouldn't admit, like she's not interested anymore or you just have different libidos and it's time to go away.",

If, every day, she's communicating that she's busy, she's exhausted, and she doesn't feel like she's getting enough support from you, and then you ask for sex when you know she's exhausted and probably going to say no, then that's adding to her problems.

How frequently do you want to have sex? What's the minimum you can tolerate? What are some things you can do in a dry spell? Given the limitations from both of you living with your families, what are things you can do that will scratch the itch that don't involve getting a hotel room or trying to find a dubious venue?

It\u2019s time to sit down and discuss what you can do better for her while making sure you\u2019re satisfied.

Either you aren't paying attention or you're disregarding her mood and desires in that moment, either way it isn't being considerate of her.\n\n\n\n>\u00a0I respect her boundaries  \n\u00a0I always respect her space\n\nConstantly pushing up against her boundaries and always expecting her to verbally define her boundaries in the moment isn't really respecting her or her space.\n\nWith that in mind, if you were single and hoping to find another person interested in hooking up would you just wander around propositioning women? I'm guessing you wouldn't, why aren't you willing to give your girlfriend the respect  you would give strangers?\n\n\n\n>if I don\u2019t ask at all, it feels like suppressing my needs, but asking seems to annoy her. Any advice and perspectives are well appreciated.\n\nFirst and foremost recognize that sex and validation aren't needs and that treating them as such only causes issues that interfere with having a healthy and satisfying sex life. You said yourself that you seem to be annoying her and she has stated that she sees your actions as insensitive, not exactly things that are creating the mutual feelings that lead to hot monkey loving. I do believe your actions towards her have been inconsiderate and even disrespectful, but I'm guessing that isn't who you are as a person, your feelings that needs were being withheld drove you to act in manners that don't reflect who you really are as a person and don't reflect how you truly feel about your partner.\n\nNext look at how you are viewing this. Why do feel there are only two options, those choices being continuing to proposition your partner without consideration of her in that moment or you trying to always hide all of your desires from this point forward? This is a false dichotomy, and this black and white thinking (likely influenced by viewing desires as needs) ties back to you behaving in ways that aren't true to yourself or in your own best interest. \n\nMy advice, learn how to flirt. This means you have to be considerate of your partner, you have to give them the same respect you would give a stranger if you were single and wanted to get to know them because you were attracted to them. Giving your partner the respect you would give a stranger isn't a big ask right? So make the effort to meet your partner where they are at in that moment and express yourself in a manner appropriate to that moment, you can than escalate if/when a slight escalation seems like it would be well received. **It isn't about suppressing your desires, it is about expressing them in a way that is in your own best interest and is respectful/considerate of others in that specific moment.**",
