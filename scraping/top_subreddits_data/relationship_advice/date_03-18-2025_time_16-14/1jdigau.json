You guys have made me feel leagues better and helped me to not feel alone. Thank you Reddit \ud83d\udc95\n\nWell I\u2019m done, I left with my daughter. \nHe was entirely unwilling to break things off with the other woman(who has a family of her own, mind you). I\u2019m not going to show my daughter that it\u2019s okay for a partner to mistreat you. \n\nI have nothing, I have to start from nothing, I have to move back with my parents and I don\u2019t have a super great relationship with them. I\u2019m shattered, I miss who I thought my husband was, I wanted a family. I waited years to get married to him and have a baby for this EXACT reason. But I have my daughter, who I love more than anything in the world.\n\nWe still have to figure out divorce and custody, but I want to focus on myself now. Getting my color back, taking care of myself again. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented and reached out, I truly couldn\u2019t have done this without you",

Instead of helping with the house and parenting, he was out having an emotional affair with a married woman.\n\nAnd yeah, she\u2019s just as guilty. She knew about you, knew what you were going through, and still didn\u2019t care. You should find her husband and tell him what\u2019s up\u2014he deserves better too. He\u2019s probably out there working his ass off for his family while his wife is sneaking around, giving her attention and energy to another man.\n\nYou 100% made the right call leaving that guy. You\u2019re gonna rise from this like a damn phoenix because you\u2019re a warrior and an amazing mom. Soon, you\u2019ll see you\u2019re way better off without him\u2014no more playing married single parent and his maid on top of that.\n\nBe proud of yourself. You put yourself and your daughter first, showed that you respect yourself, and set an example for her that this kinda treatment is not okay.\n\nNow, get a lawyer ASAP and start the divorce process. Fight for you and your daughter\u2019s rights. Since you were a SAHM, you\u2019re entitled to alimony and child support. And don\u2019t just separate\u2014while you\u2019re still married, his debts are your problem too, and you have no idea what he\u2019s spending money on. Have you even checked the bank statements?\n\nAlso, change all your passwords, open a bank account he can\u2019t touch, and get tested for STDs. Even if the affair was \u201cjust emotional,\u201d you don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s been up to\u2014or how long he\u2019s been lying to you. The only thing you do know is that you can\u2019t trust him.",

He was an alcoholic who physically, emotionally, and financially abused my mom for years and cheated on her. She was a SAHM with no money or education, and society didn\u2019t exactly support divorced women. \n\nMe and my sister eventually managed to force my mom to leave him. He stopped drinking and got his shit together, completely changed as a person, and my mom went back to him\u2014mostly because she was tired of working shitty jobs that barely put food on the table. He never cheated or abused her again, but she never truly forgave him. That became very clear when, years later, she abandoned him in the hospital while he was dying of cancer. After he passed and she was finally free, it was like a huge weight had been lifted off her.\n\nMe and my sister were able to have some kind of relationship with him, but we never truly forgave him and could never be close to him.\n\nThat\u2019s why I always tell women not to put themselves in a situation where they have no power in the relationship. If you don\u2019t have financial independence, it\u2019s way harder to leave a toxic relationship and fight for your rights. As a SAHM, your whole life\u2014and your kids\u2019\u2014can take a turn for the worse if your partner leaves you, you leave him, or he dies.",

But that first part is all important. \n\nClear communication\n\nYour husband utterly failed that part. Which in this case suggests that he is not separating role play from real life very well. \n\nThere are people who meet in RP-heavy MMOs while single and form a relationship that is RP/game -only. Others form relationships that move on to RL. \n\nContrariwise, there are those who keep their spouses up to date on their in game stuff and what is happening in their RP guild, and would say to their spouse \"Hey, based on the storylines here, I think my character would be likely to get together with this character. What do you think?\"\n\nI've done all three, pretty much in that order, but found that I didn't need that layer of connection any more, so that last one hasn't come up in a while. But not everyone will be the same. I know there are people who still do that third option all the time, with different characters in different storylines have romances with different characters run by different players. \n\nAgain, your husband utterly failed at keeping these things separate and doing things the right way. You are correct in having left him for his utter BS. It is cheating; he is getting an emotional and sexual charge/reaction/pleasure from the relationship.",
