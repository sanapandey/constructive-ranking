    "selftext": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/dG3Zx3279V)\n\nHello all, I thought I\u2019d provide an update on things since my last post received a lot of input from this community.\n\nThings are actually pretty good. We went to relationship counselling together, and even though the therapist wasn\u2019t a good fit for us, I could tell we both left feeling better about things and a bit more aligned.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my partner about how I was feeling. Neither of us want the relationship to end but we both know it\u2019s a real likelihood of things don\u2019t improve. I think this was the catalyst.\n\nOur sex life is still non-existent for now. But we are both trying to make things better through working on ourselves. We are both exercising, eating healthy, and arguing less. I can see how much she is trying / making changes and it gives me a much more optimistic outlook on our relationship. As a result I\u2019m finding myself more attracted to her.\n\nI know things aren\u2019t solved, or even ideal, but my partner has shown me enough for me to stay committed to our relationship and I\u2019m going to focus on doing what I can to make her feel better too.\n\nI\u2019m certain some of you will think I\u2019m insane for staying. Others will think I\u2019m a shallow guy who somehow shouldn\u2019t have these feelings. Right now I\u2019m just focusing on how our relationship is at the moment - I\u2019m not letting my anxiety for the future get the better of me - if things go backwards then I may have to reconsider, but today, things are good.\n\n\nP.S - Thank you to everyone who weighed in on my situation with genuine advice on my last post. I really appreciate you taking the time.\n",

If you said that you didn't love her anymore because she struggled with mental health, simply had aged and didn't look 20 years old anymore, or had unrealistic expectations (expecting her to spend thousands of dollars for painful surgery, personal trainers, and starvation diets) to please you, then you would be shallow. She's struggled for your whole relationship, and I'm glad you are supporting her to do what's best for her health now.\n\nIt's not shallow to start to lose attraction for a partner who has developed poor hygiene and loads of unhealthy habits. And you clearly still love her as a person and are concerned for her. And you started to feel attraction again when you saw she was making an effort. That's a big green flag. The effort is the most attractive thing.\n\nI hope this healthy living trend continues!",
