    "selftext": "I last posted a variation of this a little over 5 years ago. We're a little overdue for a repost.\n\n---\n\nYou know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all \"A+++ would ride again.\" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.\n\nYou can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for \"break up with them\" and \"get rid of them\" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:\n\n1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. \n\n2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. \n\nThe majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened\u2014your account\u2014with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. \n\nThe number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:\n\n* Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. **Zero stars** on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.\n\n* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because \"once a cheater, always a cheater.\" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**\n\n* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**\n\n* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. **Three to four stars.**\n\n* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is **four to five stars.**\n\nYou can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.\n\nBasically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.\n\n---\n\n##TL;DR: \n\nThe vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.\n\n(inspired to repost this thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dc05p7/had_to_end_my_birthday_party_early_because_a_1/l7vtsis/?context=3) by u/NotAmericanDontCare.

Most commenters jump to the cheating conclusion or come up with allegedly universal rules for not having friends of the opposite gender, not being amicable with exes, and so on. Which, for me, is the definition of toxic control. People are different.\n\nAnother topic that is like fire on fuel is the \"boyfriend not proposing\" trend.\n\nMany people also don't really read between the lines \u2013 if they read the full post at all and don't detect or take into account very obvious bias from the OP in narrating the story.\n\nAll of this said, there are so many stories every day of obvious, textbook emotional and physical abuse, or years-long relationship with a partner who behaves in a blatant disrespectful, childish, unfair way, despite being a full grown adult. Many times, the \"break up\" comments are actually the best advice. It's a reality check that can give you a hard but useful idea of how your relationship looks like to someone who is not deep in the fog as you are. But of course, some deeper analysis and more thoughtful advice is more useful.\n\nPersonally, after these 3 years following the subreddit, I find there is often very biased, non-pertinent, drastic advice when it comes to the jealousy/insecurity sphere, but I always see very well written, thoughtful, useful comments when it comes to toxic relationships.",

Basically, the \u201cPower & Control Wheel\u201d, like instances of sexual harassment/ assault, emotional abuse, being intimidated, being isolated, economic abuse, male privilege, gaslighting, being coerced and threatened. These are all very valid abusive behaviors that should be highlighted as such and not pushed into the general consensus of anyone \u201coverreacting\u201d.\n\nI might even argue victims that are still in abusive relationships passively reading those posts and subsequent comments are receiving (recognizing the above listed abusive situations) valid reassurance about their own situation & then leaving without having to post themselves. *On that note, there should be a pinned post with the \u201cPower & Control Wheel\u201d.*\n\nOn another note, we're not therapists. So, as much as legal advice is reserved for lawyers, I think relationship advice ideally should come from therapists.
