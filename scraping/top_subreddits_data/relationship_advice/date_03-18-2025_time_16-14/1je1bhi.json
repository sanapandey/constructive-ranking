My parents would always ask all 3 of us to go away with them. I\u2019m annoyed and frustrated but still not entirely sure how I should be feeling. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s mum hasn\u2019t even bothered to ask if wanted to go with them, I feel left out as she\u2019s asking them but not even though I\u2019m the other half and the dad.\n\nIt frustrates me as me and my fianc\u00e9s family have always got along well and wonder if I should say anything but don\u2019t want to seem rude or like I don\u2019t want them to go but I feel it\u2019s rude of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mum.\n\nIs there anything I should say to my fianc\u00e9/fianc\u00e9\u2019s mum?",

The majority of break ups are caused by a lack of communication. People aren't mind readers. If you haven't said anything to your fiance chances are she doesn't know there is a problem.\n\nThe problem I see here is that there is a potential red flag. If she just agrees with her mother all the time over you then she hasn't got her head round the fact she's moved into the next phase of her life, partner and child. If there was no child in the mix and it was just mom wanting a family holiday taking just your fiance then it wouldn't be an issue. It's the fact she's taking fiance and child, but hasn't even mentioned the dad. It says mom doesn't consider you part of the family and disposable. Do you two live together? If you do it's even weirder. If you don't then you have been shown where you stand in the family and it's on the outside. \n\nStart by having a conversation with your fiance about how hurt and upset you are that her mother didn't even consider you. Or at least say something along the lines of \"I really want to take them away so she can have a break and I can get some grandma time with the little one, but I can't afford to pay for all of you, Do you mind\". That at least would have acknowledged your existence. As it is others are making decisions about your child without including you in the conversation. It's not on the level of circumcising him and giving him an earring without asking you, but it's certainly disrespectful.",

I went on holiday with my parents and siblings with my children without their dad (when we were still together) as my mum was paying to take us all away for her birthday. He wasn\u2019t bothered at all, he got a nice week break to do what he wanted and wasn\u2019t left to look after the children alone. I also got a break as my whole family helped with them and we got to spend quality family time together which I wouldn\u2019t have had if their dad had been there. He had also been away with his family and our children before similar way. \n\nEven as a family unit with children it was always still nice to have time with our own families without our partner. I do not believe in the idea that we should ALWAYS come as a joint package that\u2019s weird and unnecessarily codependent. \n\nHOWEVER you clearly want to go so if you can afford to pay for yourself then just ask MIL if you can join, though to me it seems like THEIR family holiday and your son is only going because he is so young.",
