    "selftext": "My husband and I are trying to spice up our sex life (I am the one actively trying to, he\u2019s just along for the ride). We were watching a racy movie and I asked him if we can choose two toys out of our collection tonight. He gave a \u201cdo we have to?\u201d kind of reaction and made a vibrator joke. We went to the bedroom, I pulled out the box of toys and he chose the wand, and I asked him if he can choose another, and he said no. Because it feels like pulling teeth to try to get him to be proactive in our sex life, it upset me enough that I told him I don\u2019t want to have sex anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever rejected him, whereas he probably rejects me at least several times a month. \n\nHe demanded I come back to bed \u201cor he was going to get really pissed.\u201d \n\nI think that reaction is insane. Tried to communicate how I feel like how we go about our sex life makes me feel unsexy and undesired, he refused to communicate with me and now I\u2019m sleeping on the couch.\n\nWe\u2019re already going to couples counseling, what the hell am I supposed to do. \n\nEDIT: There was no point where I was forcing him to do something he didn\u2019t want to do. We got the toys as part of a compromise for the lack of effort he puts into our sex life. \n\nFor example, I have asked him to blindfold me for five years. He doesn\u2019t say no, he says \u201cdo I have to?\u201d I have had conversations with him about how remarks like that kill the mood. And then he tells me he wants to try more kinky stuff but when it\u2019s actually in the moment he\u2019ll sigh and act like it\u2019s a chore. \n\nI feel like I make such a big effort and this man has not once given me a massage without me asking. And of like the 7 massages I\u2019ve ever asked him for, not once has he been able to respond with anything but \u201cdo I have to.\u201d ",

Using my mom as an example, she got married for the second time to her now stbx husband about six years ago. They never should\u2019ve gotten married to begin with imo but my mom is a firm believer in making it work even though the signs were there that she shouldn\u2019t have. The one I recall the most was in relation to how he treated others and was so bad that I explicitly told my mom I would never go out to eat with him again because his behavior was so bad. They should\u2019ve gotten divorced within the first year for a reason I can\u2019t recall atm but they almost did. So to \u201cmake it work\u201d they went to counseling. He never improved. In fact he got worse. Then he lost his job due to contracting covid during the pandemic (he worked in the medical field and was responsible for putting patients on ECMO) and tried to end his own life. He was committed after being saved and proceeded to get even worse which resulted in him threatening my mom and her life and got the cops called a few times. It\u2019s been over a year now and the divorce is still ongoing because he has delayed things so much after explicitly stating he \u201cwill ruin\u201d my mom. \n\nI doubt OP is going to experience things like that with her partner because I would like to think that not all men are like this POS that\u2019s still attached to my family but if someone feels it\u2019s not worth it to keep trying after they\u2019ve tried, it\u2019s okay. It does take two to make things work in a relationship. Things cannot and will not ever work out if the other partner doesn\u2019t actually take part in all of the work too which appears to be the case in this post. Things absolutely should not need to be a Big Issue\u2122 every time. Sometimes it\u2019s the same little thing that never changes no matter how hard you try to work it out or let it go. Eventually you need to have enough self love and self respect to say \u201cenough\u201d.",

If a husband liked rough choking, and spanking, but the wife didn't would you say that the \"wife was having lackluster and dull sex and was unwilling to make adjustments\"?\n\nTo me they are married, which means the sex was fine before, but bc of how long they've been together, perhaps its lost it's passion or intensity, or could be entirely something else.

I dated a guy like that four four years in my twenties. When I finally succeeded in breaking up with him, everyone (at first) was like, \"Aww, but he's such a NICE GUY and he's so SAD.\" He told everyone he was right on the verge of proposing to me and had bought a ring (yeah right). \n\nI stopped hearing those sentiments after he tried to attack me twice in public. I'm not saying your husband is going to do that to you... but it's possible. And, frankly, even without the punching-the-wall nonsense, I'd be questioning whether I wanted to stay with someone who *this early in your marriage* is acting like a petulant child about simply fulfilling your needs. (The fact that you're the bread earner and seemingly do all the household chores doesn't bode well either.)\n\nIf I were you, I'd cut my losses and move on. Easier said than done, I know \u2014 but what seems most likely to me, based on everything you've said, is that you'll either 1) end up breaking up within a couple years anyway and rue the time you wasted, or 2) have kids, your problems will get worse, and you'll have to extract yourself from a much worse quagmire 5-10 years down the road.",

Blindfolding is entry-level BDSM or CNC or both, and if he's not into that nothing in the fucking world will make him change his opinion.  That's a wiring issue, pure and simple, y'all ain't wired the same.  \n\nWhy are you browbeating this man into submission when by your own words you're \"attractive, physically fit, work on yourself\" etc etc and you describe him like this?  There's a dude out there that wants to do the things you want in bed, I promise you, but this guy just isn't the guy.  That's okay, is what it is.  \n\nBut I gotta say it's so weird that you'd rather crowdsource advice on how to train this fella than just go find someone you're more compatible with.

Your husband\u2019s hypocrisy - that he rejects you regularly but got infuriated when you rejected him once. The fact that you\u2019re the one doing all the work to spice up your sex life. That your husband acts soft-spoken/gentle around others but punches a wall in anger when he\u2019s alone with you.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m curious how he has reacted when you are assertive or give pushback in other realms. Or voice any dissatisfaction. Does he listen to your feedback without getting defensive or shifting blame?\u00a0\n\nAlso, whose idea was it to find a compromise with the sex toys, and to go to couple\u2019s counseling?\u00a0\n\nIt feels like the best case scenario here is you\u2019re married to a man who is extremely emotionally immature, and who does not pull his weight in the relationship because he has learned that he doesn\u2019t have to, because no matter how badly he behaves, you will continue to stay with him, financially support him and to do the lions share of the housework. He does not love you enough to change and he has zero material incentive to.\u00a0\n\nA worse (or maybe worst) case scenario is he uses his low libido to control you. Saying he wants to do more kinky stuff but finding fault with your attempts etc. As long as you\u2019re focused on jumping through hoops to fix the sex issue you\u2019re distracted from the other ways he\u2019s failing you as a partner. Hard to gauge without knowing more about your dynamic but it\u2019s something to keep in mind.\u00a0",

I would feel pressured as fuck ESPECIALLY if I got the \"now I don't want to anymore\" afterwards.\n\nShe wants to have it her way and ONLY her way and that's just not healthy.\n\nEdit: and whatever happened to \"no is a full sentence?\"",

If this was a man constantly asking for kinky sex from a woman and the woman continually responded with \"do I have to?\" (then from the sounds of it had sex anyway on multiple occasions). it would be easy to see the abuse. I think the comment of anger after sex was off the table is a HUGE problem, and the probably the main problem here.   \n  \nThe situation feels abusive to start based on description though.   \n  \nI want to ask: Has there ever been any kind of punishment emotional or otherwise if he just says no? Im talking cold shoulder, obvious disappointment / pouting, passive aggression. From the statement it is hard to know if its \"get back here and have sex with me because you owe me\" and \"lets just have sex so I can have a decent evening in peace for the love of god\".  \n  \nIf my wife ever responded with \"do I have to??\" the mood would shift from sexy to conversation IMMEDIATELY because only enthusiastic consent is consent to me.   \n  \nStill going to the toy selection process after that statement is wild to me.",

Anatomy.\n\nIf a woman brings a vibrator to the bedroom she most likely uses it simultaneously with her male partners penetration, as hopefully many men and women know most women cannot orgasm by penetration alone. However if you bring a fleshlight to the bedroom, unless you are some octopus with multiple dicks you can only put it in one place, leaving your partner untouched and unsatisfied most likely because your too busy playing with a fake vagina while the real life one attached to your so called loving partner is\u2026 watching? It just doesn\u2019t work. Unless of course it\u2019s just mutual masturbation which isn\u2019t really sex. \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of toys made for men that is not a fleshlight\u2026. And can be used simultaneously during sex. I\u2019m not sure why you focus on fleshlight as an example, the toy that is made for solo time. Odd. \n\nNow if you were to ask \u201chow is it any different to a man bringing a cock ring to the bedroom\u201d myself and many others would say it\u2019s no different! Because it can actually be used together. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty straight forward to anyone with a basic concept of the female anatomy and sex education. \n\nHope that helps",

Most women orgasm from clitoral stimulation. Also fact. Vibrator is able to be used to do both at the same time. Dildos and fleshlights are not made for clitoral stimulation therefore not relevant to what I\u2019m talking about.",

These are real fears men have and reasons they give for trying to forbid women from owning or using toys. While understandable, because society, we do find it ludicrous that y'all feel threatened by pieces of plastic. I just don't see your hypothetical scenario playing out in the same way - and it doesn't, as we can tell because it's not a ubiquitous occurrence that women trade stories about constantly, unlike the other thing; but also, our entire identity as people and as partners just isn't tied to one body part in a way that would cause that level of insecurity.",

I've literally never in my life heard a story of a man taking a fleshlight to bed with a woman, so perhaps the reason women are more likely to complain about their partners objection to toy usage is more directly correlated with their partners lower incidence of genital replacement toy usage by their partners.\n\nBut no, let's draw a 1to1 that doesn't exist and tell me both that mens insecurities are too much while also claiming reverse but equal treatment deserves more judgement.\n\nIf you want to criticize the clarity of THIS post, go right ahead, but if you intend to do so at least please recognize first that debating your level of cognitive dissonance requires at least a little getting into vagueries.",

Neither of those make him a bad guy doing mean things but the comments act as if he is a horrible person. It should be acceptable for a man to have a preference for not including things like blindfolds in sex and getting mad at him for being uncomfortable with it is wrong. Just like it would be wrong to keep asking a woman to do something after she has clearly shown that she doesn\u2019t want to.

Turned me down regularly and of course told me I could turn him down as well if I didn't feel like having sex, but would spend the rest of the day being purposely quiet or passive aggressive. We were together about 4 years, and in my experience, it only gets worse. Go to counseling if you believe he's in a spot where he might be reasonable about it and change his behavior, but from the way you described him I'm not sure he is. The \"I'm going to get pissed off\" is too much, even if it doesn't seem like it now. It starts small and before you know it you're letting them disrespect you and cross boundaries you thought you were firm on.

I also asked if they wanted a sexless relationship & I'd be ok with it because I felt weird asking - \"no no, keep asking! It's just rare & I won't tell you until you ask!\").\n\nActions over words. Even if it feels like you're not trusting them / they SAY you're not trusting them. Because if their actions don't match their words you actually can't trust them. An enthusiastic yes is the only yes when it comes to sex. \n\nEvaluate how you feel about a relationship where his actions are the truth and how you feel about Yourself in a relationship where his actions are the truth.

We don\u2019t abide by the old adage \u201cnever go to bed angry\u201d because it\u2019s often worse to end up angry *and* sleep deprived. \n\nIn your situation, I could see you being the one to volunteer for the couch, but I\u2019m genuinely curious if that was actually the case. Because if me & my partner were in the situation and I had stated I was sleeping on the couch, he\u2019d tell me \u201cno, I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d He\u2019s the one who initiated the argument, I\u2019m the one still mostly upset, and he\u2019s not been willing to talk it out.\n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t think your partner has the emotional intelligence to acknowledge the role he\u2019s playing, here. He\u2019s trying his hardest to be a passive participant in y\u2019all\u2019s relationship. Just a bystander watching you put in the effort until it\u2019s his turn to enjoy the rewards. You withdrew the effort, resulting in his loss of benefits - how dare you! (/s)\n\nIs he participating in couples counseling, or are y\u2019all having to pull his tongue just to half-ass his way through it? Is the therapist a good fit for both you? Are they experienced in the specific issues you\u2019re wanting to address, which sounds like communication *and* sex/intimacy?\n\nI think it\u2019s worth putting an expiration date on this man.
