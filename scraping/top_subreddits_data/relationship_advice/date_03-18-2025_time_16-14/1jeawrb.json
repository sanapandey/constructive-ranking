    "selftext": "I\u2019ve moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years Eric, and we\u2019ve agreed to split cooking 50/50, which means one week I cook all the meals and the next week, he cooks all the meals.\n\nTo say he is a chicken nugget boyfriend is hyperbolic, but to put it into context, I grew up with a French chef for a dad, so I\u2019ve learned to cook good, varied and healthy meals. My boyfriend can make spaghetti, chilli con carne and other quite basic \u2018meat and veg\u2019 sort of dishes.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to make mad elaborate dishes like coq au vin or anything, but he doesn\u2019t like any kind of fish unless it\u2019s breaded, so no salmon, mackerel or anything like that. Cant serve any meat that is \u2018on the bone\u2019 so no wings, chicken thighs or anything soups that require a meat broth. For vegetables I can\u2019t go too elaborate either (broccoli, peas, carrot fine). Took the first year to get him to eat a salad.\n\nRecently he came to visit my family in France for Christmas where my chef dad wanted to make a huge elaborate meal for us and I had to veto basically everything except classic meat and veg, which was a bit embarrassing (and was served on the bone which he ate!!). If forced (ie in front of dad) he will eat everything and always enjoys it!\n\nI would like a healthy varied diet, and on the weeks I cook, I\u2019d like to try new recipes - Thai, Vietnamese, fish dishes etc and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s unfair to just cook what I like and tell him to lump it, or to cater for him when it\u2019s my week to cook and just do what I know he\u2019ll eat. His cooking weeks are pretty basic but I don\u2019t complain. However I\u2019d like to do what I want when it\u2019s my week. \n\nAny thoughts? ",

So, you might make a lovely salmon and serve it with baked potatoes or maybe a thai curry with plain rice. \n\nWhen I was encouraging young kids to enjoy a varied diet, I never forced them to eat anything and always made a familiar option available, but I also didn't make that option very attractive. For instance, they would eat an unending amount of boxed mac and cheese, and they would always choose that over anything else. So if I wanted to encourage them to try something new, I shouldn't have the mac and cheese available; instead, they could have plain rice and baby carrots if they didn't want the new food. No one was tormented or went hungry, but they also had a bit of a push to the new things.",

I'm still working on fish. (I also didn't drink water until I was 21, not proud of that lol) \n\n\nAnyway, I dated a bunch of people who were very much like \"I'm gonna get you to eat vegetables\" and I'd sort of try stuff, but still dislike it. It wasn't until I actually decided in my head that I needed to be healthier and that it was getting annoying having to constantly eat before parties just in case they didn't have something I could eat. Or, going to nicer restaurants and seeing all this really good smelling food come out, but still being disgusted by it.\n\n\nIt just started to weigh on me and really just made me feel embarrassed and like I was a child. And, less desirable by the people I was interested in.\n\n\nI knew it was going to be hard, but basically I just forced myself to suffer for a bit vegetable by vegetable. I'd do broccoli dishes for 2 weeks until I finally liked broccoli, then I did corn, then carrots, then onions, and so on... For like the first couple dishes of each thing I made I'd honestly still be gagging a little at first and forced myself to finish things or eat as much as I could stand. After that I finally realized how good all that food can be.\n\n\nUltimately it took me feeling ashamed and feeling like I had to make a change before I actually buckled down and did it. Maybe if he felt like he had to change, he'd actually put effort into it.",

It\u2019s more convenient for you, sure - you get to make and eat what you want. But it sounds like you\u2019re willing to eat everything he likes\u2026 so then it\u2019s not a fair division of labour if he\u2019s making food for both of you one week, and then making food for himself the next. That\u2019s only going to breed resentment, because he\u2019s always having to make food while you get every other week off.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my partner for 20 years, and we both have things we love that the other doesn\u2019t eat; I won\u2019t eat anything out of the water and don\u2019t like meat on the bone, while my partner won\u2019t eat rice or gourds. But there are plenty of things out there that don\u2019t contain fish, or where rice can be substituted with something else. And if I really want a curry and they really want fish, we go to a restaurant, or make separate dinners. \n\nYou need to deal with this as a team. So draw up a 1 or 2 week menu of foods you both like, and maybe throw in a \u201cwildcard\u201d night each week where 1 person gets to serve whatever they want, and/or 1 night where you each fend for yourselves.\n\nThen, on _some_ of your \u201cwildcard\u201d nights, you can serve something that\u2019s a little out of his comfort zone. Substitute chicken breast for thigh, or take the meat off the bone before it\u2019s served. Try things that have  similar flavour and texture component to the things he does like - if he likes spaghetti, try different pasta and different sauces, add spinach to your meat sauce, etc. If he likes stew, substitute lamb for beef, or add tomato to change the broth profile (or both, tomato lamb stew is so good). Go through recipe books and recipe websites together, and try to find things that he likes the sound of, or that could be adjusted a bit.",

My wife knew this going in. We agreed since I was better at cooking the *very* limited menu that I would eat, I got to do the cooking. When we had kids, we would switch, because we didn't want any kids to grow up as picky as me if we could avoid it.\n\nAs it turns out, those kids never happened, so almost three decades later, I still do all the cooking.\n\nOur meals were *very* repetitive. I actually enjoy cooking, and was very good at a very small number of things. But there's a ton I won't eat.  Seafood is out. I hate it all.  Breaded or not, it's a no go. My wife likes it a *little* more than I do.  A couple times a year she will order fish and chips when we go out. This one isn't a big issue for us.\n\nI don't eat *most* meats, and I absolutely can't eat beef. I won't keep it down. While I like some more exotic, and pricey, meat, the only really budget friendly meat I will voluntarily consume is pork. I work around that most of the time without issue.\n\nI hate most vegetables, and the few I like almost all need to be raw. For example, I like raw carrots, but I *hate* them cooked. This is harder to work around.\n\nFor the first eight years of our marriage we basically rotated through half a dozen things I would eat. My wife was very patient. I *was* willing to try new recipes, as long as they were made of things I liked, so there was some relief for her.\n\nThen for about five years we had a significantly larger amount of money, so we ate out *a lot*. But good fortunes come and go.\n\nAbout a decade ago, I had a stroke while I was still in my 30s. I couldn't work. So now I was cooking *all* my meals, three times a day. I was fairly content eating the same things every day while she was at work. Supper was frustrating though. After close to two decades, the repetitiveness was getting to her. The longest part of supper was deciding *what* I would make. And my reduced ability post-stroke meant some things were off the table on some days. Then quarantine happened.\n\nNow I was making *both* of us food three times a day. Suddenly making the same things every day became a problem. I'd always found my own pickiness frustrating.  Like your boyfriend, I could force myself to eat *some* things when I was with company, but there were still very strict limits. Eating at other people's homes was often problematic. Even going out to eat *always* meant Googling a menu so I knew there was *something* I'd eat.\n\nPOST TOO LONG - CONTINUED BELOW",

Meat wasn't changing, but I was determined to eat outside my comfort zone, if only to add some variety. So with a commitment to three meals a week, I started making things I never had.\n\nAt age 46, twenty-five years into our marriage, I made rice for the first time. Mayonnaise was suddenly a part of a disturbingly high percentage of our meals. More vegetables than ever were being consumed. I was determined I would try anything at least once.\n\nSome things were only once.  It wasn't magic. I still *hate* a lot of foods. But it was better. *A lot* better. I'm never going to eat beef. Mushrooms are still anathema. But I routinely have bok choy in the fridge. I think I have *four* different kinds or rice on hand, each for different applications. I own a rice cooker. I voluntarily buy mayo, mustard, and vinegar, *all* things I wouldn't touch before. Sure, it needs to be the *right* kind of mustard, and a *particular* vinegar, but I eat them now.\n\nI'm still a picky eater. But I'm 1000% better than I was.
