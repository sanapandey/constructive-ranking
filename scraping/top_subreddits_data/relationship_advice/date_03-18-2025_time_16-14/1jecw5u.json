    "selftext": "I (F20) met my \u201csomething-more-than-friends-but-nothing-more-than-friends\u201d partner (M20) at the beginning of our freshman year at college. Ever since the first day we hung out together, we have been all over each other. \n\nAt first, it was a \u201csituationship\u201d where we occasionally had intimacy, and a date here and there. But then I started asked if we could move on to the next stage. He stated that he was scared to get into a relationship because of his last one, and told me no. Despite saying no, we continued to do \u201crelationship\u201d things. Dates, sleeping in the same bed, intimacy, kissing, etc. \n\nAround the 4 month mark, I felt myself getting agitated with how slow things were moving. I tried to say that I was okay with waiting but that\u2019s when all my friends told me that he just wanted the benefits without the title. \n\nOne night he broke down in my arms saying that he felt as though he was losing me. That\u2019s when I stated that maybe we should build our \u201cfriendship\u201d qualities more than what we have right now. Following that, we still couldn\u2019t keep our hands to ourselves. \n\nFrom 5 months in, to now, i\u2019ve been asking him about an actual relationship, and if he\u2019d be willing to at least give it a shot considering it\u2019s been almost a full year of being \u201ccasual\u201d\n\nLast night I asked him one final time. I asked \u201cWhy do you keep me around if you don\u2019t want a relationship,\u201d \n\nHe explained that he liked what we were, and being in a relationship would be a big responsibility for him, and eventually he thinks it would turn into a liability. He doesn\u2019t want to feel obligated to stay with me. \n\nEven his friends have been against him. \n\nI then explained that I should\u2019ve listened to him sooner. The way he doesn\u2019t like to think of \u201cus\u201d in the future, the way he hesitates to say \u201cI love you\u201d like he means it, the way he doesn\u2019t like getting close in public but is all over me in private. It all made sense, and it hurt. \n\nI never felt so\u2014 disposable? In a little bout of irritation I called him selfish, and he called me greedy for wanted to move so fast. I thought sitting here and waiting for 8 months was slow. \n\nWe left the conversation very open ended. He said he wanted space to cultivate himself and his craft. I asked if he thinks he\u2019ll function better without me around, and he said yes, but he doesn\u2019t want me to be a stranger? He says that \u201cIf we don\u2019t take things slow, this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d and that he still wants me around him like normal though. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.",

You\u2019ve let him use you for 8 months. Now you\u2019re looking for someone to tell you to hold on, that deep down he loves you and if you just let him use you for another 8 months or 8 years, he\u2019ll come around.\nWhat you need to do is get some therapy and find out why your self esteem is so damn low that you would let any man treat you this way.",
