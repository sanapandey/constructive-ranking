    "selftext": "EDIT*** Fiance is Male didn't mean to write 29f he is 29m\n\nHi I don't play DND, I don't know much about it other than when he shares what's going on in his campaigns. I've read some of the player handbook mostly about the classes and races. I really try to take somewhat of an interest in it but it isn't for me and we are both ok with that. \n Whilst I love that it's a passion of his I'm tired of having the same conversations over and over about how often he is on his phone playing this game. He has an online campaign and also an in person one. He meets with the in person group 2 weeks on 2 weeks off.  But the online group is continuous. They play every day and it's really getting to me. Due to us being in the UK and his players being in the states they just text whenever they can. However there will be times I just catch him when we have a conversation or go out to dinner or even at the vets for our cats appointments texting the DND server. I really really hate it. I want to tell him to limit the online campaign to twice a week at designated times but I feel that sounds super controlling. I really don't mind that he plays the game I hate how much he isn't able to fully focus on me or something we are doing because he is anxious to reply to them. \n\nAlso at work he has been told he is on his phone too much. He came home and told me this and he was super defensive about it but today whilst I was on his PC playing a game I saw pop ups on discord and he was playing DND whilst he is meant to be working. \n\nHow do I address this without coming across as unreasonable? What kind of boundaries can I put in place?\n\nTldr: fiance plays DND a lot and is often distracted on his phone because of it. I want to ask him to play less but fear that's me being controlling and stopping him from doing something he loves. \n",

It was also much easier to split the party and do smaller or individual things, because no one was sitting there being excluded. Sometimes we\u2019d get a good chain going where a bunch of people were around on the same evening, which was fun\n\nBut replying constantly, _while_ having an in-person game going every weeknight, sounds like way too much time spent on D&D to the detriment of the relationship.",

Communication is key here, you might find it helpful to sit down and have an open chat with your fiance about how his DND activities are affecting your relationship. Maybe you can suggest setting aside specific times for both of you to share what's on your mind, which could include his gaming experiences as well as other aspects of life. This way, he can still enjoy playing without it feeling like a big deal... and it gives you the chance to feel heard and valued too. Trust me, talking things through is often more productive than bottling up feelings. So give it a shot, and hopefully, it'll help smooth things out between you both",

And one of the things about them is that they're asynchronous by nature.\n\n\nI understand where he's coming from, to be honest.\u00a0 It is *incredibly* rare, in my experience, for one of those games to last if you're not, like, continually updating.\u00a0 It sounds like he's worried that if he stops being so committed, his friends will lose interest.\u00a0 But clearly his current activity is unsustainable.\u00a0 It's not only affecting your relationship but his work as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHonestly, as someone who'd give his left kidney to be in a committed D&D group?\u00a0 I'd tell him he should probably go cold turkey.\u00a0 Giving up your part in a gaming group doesn't mean giving up the hobby.\u00a0 He should still play either in-person or via webcam at set times, but the asynchronous RP is interfering with his life too much right now, and cutting back will in all likelyhood lead to a slow death of the campaign due to lack of interest, so I would recommend just ripping that bandage off fast and encourage him to quit the group and refocus on life.",
