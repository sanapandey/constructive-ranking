    "selftext": "Me (27M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for nine months. I really like her, she's funny, intelligent, incredibly supportive, and the prettiest girl I know. Everything is perfect except for one issue that has been stuck in my mind for some time.\n\nWhenever I tell her that we can't be together on a certain day, she gets really mad, stops messaging me, and makes me feel bad.\n\nFor example, one time when we were already on a date, I started feeling sick because of my IBS. She suggested that I should go home to rest. I agreed, thanked her for being supportive, and said I would follow her advice. She then got mad and started crying, saying that if she hadn't said anything, we would have continued our date, but now I was going home. This has happened multiple times, whether because of friends, family, or illness.\n\nThe last time this happened was when I told her I wasn\u2019t sure if I could see her that day because I had to meet with a seller about a car I'd been looking for months. If I didn\u2019t go, he would sell it to someone else. She got mad, saying she was never the priority and asking whether I would rather see the car or be with her. I stayed with her.\n\nI talked to her about this three months ago, explaining that it had gotten so bad that I now feel anxious whenever I can\u2019t be with her. She apologized and seemed to understand, but her behavior never changed.\n\nWhat can I do to solve this? I really like her, but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. ",

That is her making a situation that is not about her, \\*about her\\*. You were the one who was sick and needed to go home. It's not like that's what you wanted to do. Her first emotion should have been concern and sympathy, not feeling angry and sorry for herself that the date is ending and she doesn't get attention from her bf anymore. I think she is just really immature for 23.  Are you her first relationship or something? That's the vibe this gives off....like something I would have been mad at my high school boyfriend over when I was 15.",
