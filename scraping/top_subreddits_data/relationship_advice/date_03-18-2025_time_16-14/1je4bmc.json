    "selftext": "My soon-to-be ex-wife and I are divorcing. We haven't been to mediation yet so are still sharing combined finances and living under the same roof. I am employed and have been the breadwinner for the past 10 years. She is not employed and is looking for a job.\n\nShe has requested that I use my PTO to watch the kids during the entirety of their spring break so that she can go on a vacation with her affair partner. \n\nThis puts a lot of pressure on me because I don't know that I feel comfortable asking for a full week of PTO at this time. And even if I did ask for a full week of PTO, shouldn't I get half of that to go on a personal vacation while I watch the kids for the other half? And then she would do the same? Wouldn't that be fair? To me it seems as though she's acting entitled to a vacation for the full week and expects me to use my PTO to cover it.\n\nAnd finally, we haven't split finances yet. I don't feel comfortable with her using family money for a vacation that I wouldn't agree to use family money for. I think her boyfriend should pay for all of it. \n\nIs my line of thinking reasonable? Am I being uncompromising? I'm having difficulty navigating all of these things because I'm distraught due to the divorce and other life stresses - so I'm not sure I'm thinking clearly.\n\n**Edit** I'm deeply appreciative of all the input.I'm going to learn from a lot of the feedback. All in all I think I didn't do a very good job of explaining things. It's just too much of an emotional issue. My soon-to-be ex-wife and I will be working with lawyers for custody and financial splitting. ",

There are also legal aids that will advise, but not represent.

We also lived under the same roof for a while due to financial reasons so I understand how tricky this is. Because you share finances and aren't divorced, you can't withhold money from her unfortunately without getting into trouble. By the same token, you refusing to take PTO to keep the kids so she can leave might seem spiteful to a judge, especially since you said she doesn't work so she is likely their default caregiver. If I had to guess, I would say feeling burned out might have contributed to the demise of your marriage but that is only a guess. I suggest you tell her that you cannot get the time off for spring break. I would also divide the finances evenly based on what is left after bills and put your half in a separate account and leave the rest for her. That should keep you in the clear legally. You should plan to take PTO during summer and take the kids for a week then. Most judges award part of summer to fathers anyway so you should expect that your PTO will likely be used on your kids from now on until they are older and have more say in the situation. I will say that if your wife has been the primary caregiver throughout your children's lives, she is likely to get full custody while you get visitation. If that isn't what you want, then try to work out an agreement on your own.",

I\u2019m the sure the betrayal hurt, & you\u2019re still grieving this marriage.\n\nAs I\u2019m reading this, I\u2019m breaking it down to the nitty gritty without all the fluff. Your ex wants a week off from her job (SAHM.) From the comments it sounds like you can understand how that\u2019s reasonable, since at one point you had 4 months away from the family altogether. \nIt sounds like her asking you to take a week PTO to watch the kids was an attempt at her finding a solution for childcare so she can have a week off. Do you have any family that can help if taking PTO isn\u2019t an option? \n\nAs for using family money - was she a SAHM due to lack of childcare if not? Would you allow her to use your shared family funds if she had just told you she needed a week away & the bf wasn\u2019t involved? If previously she was allowed to make financial decisions with the money, I can see why she would feel like she\u2019s entitled to use the money for a break. IMO, SAHM can be a full time job, & nobody should be doing that for free.\n\nTo be clear, I in no way at all condone infidelity. It just sounds like the ex needs a break. \nI hope you can enjoy some one on one time with your kids, I hope you both can be great coparents for your children\u2019s sake, & I wish you all the best in this healing period through your divorce.",

I mean, they are your kids. It's called parenting. If you don't want to take time off, then make arrangements for childcare, like you'll have to do once your wife isn't living with you anymore. You'll be responsible for them on your own, this is good practice. \n\nAs far as \"family money\", I mean, I guess I'm wondering how much access she had to money for herself in the last 10 years? Was she able to spend as she saw fit? Did she have unlimited access, or was she given an allowance to spend on herself? Does she have a credit card that you pay? As far as the divorce goes, can you make a n agreement (in writing) that this vacation money comes out of whatever she will be awarded?\n\nShe is responsible for the children while you are at work, with no ability to take \"PTO\" from her work. To say that you want to split spring break with her, when you will be getting paid to be off work, but you don't want her to use \"family money\" for her vacation, is kind of wild to me. Like... That's her work, why shouldn't she get paid time off from it if you can?",

His father would try to get out of taking care of him when he was sick and that responsibility always fell to me- thus leaving me with less PTO time for an actual vacation whereas his father would have plenty. This often seems to be the complaint of most women who share rearing children with a spouse or an ex. \n\nSecond- I planned and paid for 99% of the vacations for my son or the three of us. He rarely ever took the initiative to do that- even for just himself and our son. It was almost always usually a family event that he had to attend and took our son- and not an actual vacation. \n\nThree- whenever I wanted to take vacation for myself, childcare became a huge issue for him and often caused arguments or left me having to find alternative means of childcare, or my son came with me (which was fine)- except that in over a decade I only ever took 4 weekend overnight \u201cvacations\u201d without my son. \n\nFour- As far as I know, All of his vacations have been taken without his son and almost always his girlfriend for several days at a time- whether or not it accommodated my schedule. What bothered me more than anything was that he never planned these lavish vacations for his own son- trips to HPW or even Universal. That irks me as he can spend this kind of time and money on a woman, but not his own child. \n\n\nI would suggest you take a look at the dynamics of your marriage and roles. Is what she is asking over the too and one sided? Or is this finally a vacation she wants to take for herself and her new partner now that things are moving on??? Unlike marriage, in which responsibility can fall easily more to one parent than the other, co-parenting is going to be more divided. You can take it to your attorney, judge, court- but co-parenting from a court room is going to cause both parties to step up in ways they have not had to before. And if a majority of the child responsibility fell to her to ensure your PTO was protected in the long rub, then it may come down to you now having to fork out that PTO to do what she was doing for years- if that\u2019s the case. Again, I don\u2019t know your situation. I can only offer insight from what I went through.",

I'm on your side here. The boyfriend needs to pay for it all.

The two of you are no longer working as a team. Yes, yes, you are trying to co-parent, and many would say that's a team activity, but you're used to her thinking about your wants and needs when she makes choices, and she's not obligated to do so any longer if you're divorcing. So from her perspective, it's up to you how you deal with the week she wants off, if that means PTO, so be it. But it's not her problem how you handle the responsibility of caring for your kids when it's your parenting time. \n\nBecause you don't yet have a custody arrangement, it's unclear whose parenting time it is, but the fact remains she doesn't have to factor in how you'd handle yourself when the kids are your responsibility. \n\nRight now, it sounds like you take on more responsibility nights and weekends. But, unless you cede majority custody to her, you're going to have to figure out how to take care of your kids while working at least some of the time. And if you do decide to give her majority custody, it will still be your responsibility to figure out how you parent your kids during whatever time you do get (summers, weekends, specific holiday periods, that kind of thing). The only way you're not going to have to deal with all that, and you really don't sound ready to do so, is if you give her total custody of your kids and don't get any time with them. \n\nThis is why your dream of doing the divorce on the cheap without lawyers is foolish. You need to hash out the details of how post-divorce parenting is going to work, and you need to recognize that in that post-divorce reality, you're not going to be able to protest about taking PTO and somehow have it supersede whatever parenting arrangements you've settled on. \n\nYou need legal advice, and you need a legally binding agreement. Neither you nor your wife sound equipped to do it the no-lawyers, just-mediation route. You're both stuck in the place of \"well I want/don't want X, deal with it\" mode.",

So you\u2019ve done yourself a disservice in getting measured advice as a result. \n\n\nOP, you know what is going on in your job, house and with your relationships. Nobody else here does. At some point, you\u2019re gonna have to hammer out a child care agreement with your spouse where you will 100% have to deal with all their needs during their time with you. Equitably, that\u2019s not gonna just happen on weekends. And it\u2019ll probably look like split vacations. So might as well start figuring out how that\u2019s gonna work now.\n\n\nIt also sounds like you believe your STBX deserves some sort of vacation (and with shared finances you CANNOT just freeze the budget, that\u2019s financially shitty if you). You should strive to work out both money and time budgets for your STBX to take the vacay. If it\u2019s not yet hugely acrimonious, sit down with the budget, make a reasonable proposal for time (say, Thursday through the weekend explaining why you don\u2019t have the luxury of a week off at this time) and money (a reasonable expenditure per your household budget). You can also make different offers, like, she can take Tuesday through the weekend but with a lower money budget because you need to pay for childcare while she is away. \n\n\nIMO, as someone who mediates for a living, to get through this divorce uncontested, but still getting what you absolutely need should you put your foot down, it\u2019s best to start out calm and reasonable and with open negotiations, including for spring break. Don\u2019t let emotions get the better of you right now, you\u2019ll lose more - negotiation-wise - in time, money, and life force if you do. And definitely don\u2019t let Reddit rile you up.",

Alternatively, many jurisdictions offer vacation week day camps and special-interest programs for school-age kids during typical work hours, so the BF could pay for their enrollment.\n\nBest plan of all is for them to put off their vacation until after the divorce.

Open an account in your own name and transfer at least 50% into it from any joint account.  Take note of any money left and when it comes to the divorce ask to see an itemised list of what she has spent money on.  Any money she spends that is not on the kids or day to day expenses you can ask her to repay.  Or at least ask a lawyer if that\u2019s possible.  So to answer one of your questions, no she shouldn\u2019t be using any joint money on holidays until the divorce is finalised.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point.  Why aren\u2019t you using a lawyer.  I\u2019m sorry to say this, but based on what you\u2019ve written, you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re in the right headspace to fight for a fair settlement.  No shame in that as long as you recognise it.  If she can\u2019t afford a lawyer that\u2019s her problem not yours.  At the very least please don\u2019t sign any mediated settlement until you\u2019ve had a lawyer look over it.  That shouldn\u2019t break the bank.\n\nAs for asking you to use your PTO, that\u2019s should be entirely up to you.  If you want to spend the week with your kids then do it.  But do it for you.  If you don\u2019t then suggest a parenting arrangement where you thrash out how custody arrangements should work going forward.  Do this before she goes anywhere.  If you let her pull this crap now she will do it in the future, even after the divorce.  And don\u2019t fall for any attempted guilt trip that she is stressed from looking after the kids.  She found time to go out and find herself a boyfriend, so it wasn\u2019t that traumatising.\n\nLook.  I understand you not wanting to be an asshole and it\u2019s commendable.

I am employed and have been the breadwinner for the past 10 years. She is not employed and is looking for a job. She has requested that I use my PTO to watch the kids during the entirety of their spring break so that she can go on a vacation with her affair partner. This puts a lot of pressure on me because I don't know that I feel comfortable asking for a full week of PTO at this time. And even if I did ask for a full week of PTO, shouldn't I get half of that to go on a personal vacation while I watch the kids for the other half? And then she would do the same? Wouldn't that be fair? To me it seems as though she's acting entitled to a vacation for the full week and expects me to use my PTO to cover it. And finally, we haven't split finances yet. I don't feel comfortable with her using family money for a vacation that I wouldn't agree to use family money for. I think her boyfriend should pay for all of it. Is my line of thinking reasonable? Am I being uncompromising? I'm having difficulty navigating all of these things because I'm distraught due to the divorce and other life stresses - so I'm not sure I'm thinking clearly.

            "body": "Typically you and your ex would have a schedule where one parent takes the kids during spring break this year and the other gets them the next. Whatever the other person does during their \u201coff\u201d times without the kids is not your concern. If she\u2019s still involved with this person, she\u2019ll be going on vacations with them at some point, whether it\u2019s at spring break or some other time. You need to just learn to ignore that. \n\nIf you\u2019re not going to take time off for the kids\u2019 spring break this year, you should be planning to take time off for one of their later breaks this year, and then alternate that so that you do the reverse next year. \n\nI get that there are sometimes better or worse times to take PTO, but you don\u2019t seem to be discussing anything other than this spring break. You might get more cooperation if you aren\u2019t just saying no to this spring break but are ready and willing to commit to future breaks in the not too distant future. \n\nI also get that a SAHM that takes on the vast majority of parenting can have some serious caregiver fatigue, especially with special needs issues. If you haven\u2019t been carrying your share of the load at this point, I can understand why she might want her time off to start now. But again, why aren\u2019t you already discussing summer weeks and other school breaks? If you can\u2019t do a spring break week now but could do a summer week in June, that might be more palatable to her. \n\nBoth of you will have plenty of time off from parenthood if you\u2019re planning to share custody the way that most divorced parents I know have done it. You also are likely to have responsibilities during times that you won\u2019t be able to take PTO, so you are also going to need a plan for how you will manage the kids when they are out of school and you still have to work. Start recruiting family members or babysitters now before you need them and investigate day camps in your area, as there will almost certainly be times that it will be your turn to have the kids when they are out of school but you can\u2019t take a full week off work.",

If she wants to go have play time, take it as a blessing that you get to have time with the kids and don't look back.

In the states I practice in, most family law attorneys offer free consultations. You need to figure out what you need to be doing now to make the process as easy as possible in the long run and protect your custody of the kids. A family law attorney can help you navigate who leaves the marital home (and one of you will have to, preferably soon), how to split assets (or not) leading up to the actual divorce, what to expect in terms of custody in your jurisdiction, etc. \n\nDespite our reputations, most attorneys went to law school because we want to help people. If you\u2019re unsure of where to turn and you\u2019re in the US, contact your local Legal Aid or the state Bar. Many of them have lists of attorneys who are willing to work with lower-income people on a sliding scale, if you do need to take it beyond an initial consultation. Also, if you\u2019re in the US, your JAG office can usually recommend civilian attorneys who do family law.  Good luck!",

Where is my position is that I didn't commit to anything and we didn't plan anything. \n\nSo in that sense I admit it's probably more of a failure of a communication. But now she is not willing to acknowledge her part in the communication Fair earlier and she is demanding the full time and to use our money. \n\nI also want to acknowledge that she denies this person is her a fair partner and that she only met him after we discussed divorce over the phone. I don't necessarily believe that. But I can't prove it. But I'm not sure if it matters in this case.",

I absolutely don't think that that is a statement that makes a commitment for all day every single day. But I take responsibility that that is a communication failure on my part. But I think it is on her part too. \n\nWe are currently still  sharing all money because it hasn't been split yet. I absolutely get a say in how family money is spent. We've always budgeted for an amount of personal money per month each. I've never tried to control what she spends that money on. That's entirely up to her. She has historically spent way more than that. And is trying to spend more than that on this vacation. That family money is earmarked for savings, emergencies, and kids purchases. \n\nI'm not assuming she's cheating. I know she cheated. There is evidence. She says she met this particular guy after we agreed to divorce. But I know that there was other infidelity before him, if not him. So either way infidelity. \n\nI have not tried to hide my parenting at all. I've always co-parented. Any second that I'm not on my income earning job I'm parenting or doing something domestic like dishes cleaning or laundry. \n\nWhen I was gone for training, I discussed a robust babysitter plan so that she could get breaks every single week.
