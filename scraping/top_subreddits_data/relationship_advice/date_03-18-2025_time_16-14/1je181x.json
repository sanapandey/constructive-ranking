    "selftext": "I don\u2019t know what to do this has been playing on my mind Since it happened Saturday night. I don\u2019t know if he just got carried away with himself.\n\nOur sons play football together Saturday and Sunday we spend most our weekend with the rest of the parents on the team as a group. Anyway one of the moms had a party we\u2019d all been drinking dancing what you do at parties. I said I needed to get some cigarettes he said he\u2019d walk with me we were just talking about random things having a laugh nothing inappropriate, just as we got round the corner on the way back he stopped and I said he had to say something to me he said \u201c your so amazing and beautiful\u201d I laughed awkwardly said \u201caw thanks your amazing too I\u2019m glad we\u2019re friends\u201d before I knew what was happening  he grabbed me around the waist and kissed me I didn\u2019t kiss him back I just kinda of froze. When he realised I didn\u2019t kiss him back he started to apologise and said he thought I was attracted to him aswell. I told him he can\u2019t do that we\u2019re both married and I\u2019m very much in love with my husband, he had a beautiful thoughtful wife he shouldn\u2019t be doing things like that, him and his wife have only recently got married she\u2019s such a lovely women I don\u2019t want to be the cause of any problems in their marriage so early on and I just don\u2019t like drama. He said sorry again and I told him we\u2019d just forget it had happened he\u2019d had to much to drink and he made a mistake just don\u2019t make the same mistake again. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my husband because again I didn\u2019t want to cause a problem it would blow our entire friendship group apart and the kids genuinely love each and want spend all their time together. However I can\u2019t help but feel guilty for not telling my husband we don\u2019t lie to each other and I realise I\u2019m not lying I\u2019ve just not told him what\u2019s happened I want to but I\u2019m scared of what will happen and how he will react not towards me but his friend. He knows I would never ever cheat we\u2019ve been together 18 years high school sweethearts it never been anybody but him. I\u2019m starting to question my behaviour trying to think back I\u2019d said to make him think I\u2019d want him to kiss me? \n\nEDIT\nI\u2019m going to tell my husband tonight I know it may seem like a stupid question to ask but I was confused and overwhelmed by the situation I\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve also made a mistake but there was no way I was going to tell my husband who was drunk. \n\nFor the people suggesting I liked what he did or did I secretly want the attention. I get plenty of attention from my husband I don\u2019t need any from any body else we have a happy healthy secure marriage. It\u2019s easy for people telling me I should of told him immediately I froze I didn\u2019t know what to do I never expected him to do that ever he trusts this man with his life they served in the army together, when he was away his friend helped with our son did any manly things that needed doing whilst we lived on base because we were so far from family at the time. \n\nMy dad is a serial cheater I\u2019ve watched him ruin several lives growing up and my husband knows how against cheating I am. I\u2019ve watched my dad actions Implode our family I would never cheat. I made a choice at the time admittedly a bad one. ",

            "body": "I think this can be a grey situation despite people making it seem super obvious. But I think how I would handle it 100% depends on your relationship with your husband. If you tell eqchtoher everything and you aren\u2019t the least bit worried about how your husband will react, then you HAVE to tell him. Not only do you have already a truthful dynamic with him so telling him maintains that honesty, but if you know that he\u2019s not going to blame you, then it\u2019s important to take that opportunity. Because if he finds out in a year or two, you\u2019re going to be stuck explaining why you tried to hide it from him. That\u2019ll cause way more issues than anything else. Personally, I trust my wife to be understanding and have a conversation and trust me. So if a woman kissed me, I would tell her the second I had a chance to. Whether it be that night, or later that day, or whatever. I\u2019d tell her instantly, but that\u2019s the kind of dynamic we have. So it\u2019s important to me to keep that honesty. Plus I know she trusts me and knows that I would never seek out another woman. So she wouldn\u2019t blame me for it.\n\nHowever, I say it\u2019s a grey area because I can imagine a situation in which a woman might be afraid of how their husband might respond. And I\u2019d say there, you know your husband better than anyone. And if there\u2019s a chance that he might blame you and take it out on you instead of his friend (many guys might), then I personally don\u2019t see a point. Because if a partner is going to blame you anyway, then it\u2019s going to cause trust issues regardless. So there\u2019s an argument to be made that if you are going to have him angry at you and blaming you, would you rather it be guaranteed right now, or procrastinate it and hopefully he never finds out? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d take the chance if I knew or had a strong feeling that my partner wouldn\u2019t be understanding anyway.\n\nBut like I said, it depends on your relationship. And you mentioned that you don\u2019t think he\u2019d be mad at you. So in your case, I suggest telling him. You have to be honest, friend group be damned. You have no idea how many women he\u2019s done this to, and not speaking out could put you or other women in further danger as well. He sounds like a predator.",

There is no point in messing up her life; he will straighten up, or he will not; not up to you.\u00a0\n\n\nI am undecided about having a further conversation with him; others will chime in on that one.\n\n\n\u00a0Part of me says you ought to say something so that he won't hurt her - but the other part of me says he would just ignore that and do whatever he's going to do anyway.\n\n\nI just don't want you to really act too awkward around him...\n\n\nI guess you have to decide how close he is to your husband. Maybe he just made a mistake, fucked up, and he'll realize it and be over it. Maybe it's who he is.\u00a0\n\n\nAlmost the same thing happened to me early in my marriage - next door neighbor spun my wife around and kissed her; I probably should have knocked his head off, but I wasn't really a fighter, I was more the type that I would be real cool and calm until it went just a bit too far and then I would - well, anyway.\u00a0\n\n\nMy last thought is yeah, probably, you ought to say something to him when he's sober, kind of clear the air, let him know that hey we're all adults now and this is real life it's not high school, he's got to grow up now.\u00a0\n\n\nMen really, really hate those words.\u00a0\n\n\nBut then I would guess 80% of all men... Are really just older and still immature boys...",

If my man comes to me and tells me that a friend of mine kissed him some time ago and he hasn't told me because he wasn't sure what to do, my first instinct is going to be to check if he is okay and my second is going to be to check if our relationship is okay that he didn't feel immediately safe to come to me. What I'm not about to do is blame him for needing time to think on things after he was assaulted.\n\nSeriously, if you have so little faith in your partner that them not running to you immediately when something happens to them is enough for you to accuse them of \"trickle truthing\" or \"betraying you\", then just cut them loose because you are a ticking time bomb for blowing up at them for some perceived slight in the future.",
