    "selftext": "Like I said my girlfriend recently graduated college and is looking for a full time job. Since she\u2019s out of school she can no longer be on her parents health or dental insurance and she always either by joking or being serious says let\u2019s just get married for my insurance. It\u2019s starting to take a toll on my mental health. She grinds her teeth at night and every time she complains about her jaw hurting or her teeth cracking I feel like if I married her right now it would solve all her problems. I sometimes feel obligated to marry her and want to marry her out of guilt but I know if my friend was going through this I would tell him not to do this. It clouds my judgment as well. I can see myself marrying her because I love her but I\u2019m not in a rush and don\u2019t want to get married to \u201crescue\u201d her from her problems, and it\u2019s hard to see past that when she constantly brings up how her physical therapy would be better if she was on my insurance and she could get proper dental work if she had my insurance. I just feel really guilty and just I feel bad for her. Sometimes I feel like I wish she would just break up with me and find a guy who would marry her right away so she could latch onto him and use all the benefits but I just don\u2019t see marriage that was I see it as a choice to spend the rest of your lives together because you love each other, but it seems like the main driving factor for her is for the benefits. It\u2019s almost giving me relationship burnout because a lot of our conversations revolve around talking to her about her medical problems which inevitably leads to me feeling guilty about not marrying her to help her.

Go ahead and tell the middle-aged Gen X mother graduated college in the '90s that she has zero resilience because her Boomer parents kept her on her health insurance and she was 26. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And that's why the Gen Z also have zero resilience... LMAO \n\nThat's the last four generations which generation of parents have refused to allow their children to feel any discomfort and has resulted in them having zero resiliency? Because I got four generations here. Do you want to go back another one? Because this kind of health insurance didn't exist for my mother, but her parents helped her with a down payment for her house and helped her and my father throughout my childhood whenever my parents needed money. So, did the silent generation ruin the boomers? Because the silent generation was helping their kids just as much. And my grandparents? They weren't wealthy. They grew up in the projects in Southie with poverty that you can't even begin to imagine. I'm pretty sure that you weren't living in public housing just after the Great depression.\n\nThis is all an excuse for you to shit on other people. And think that you are better somehow than they are. For some reason, you enjoy shitting on other people's lives. Lives. Probably because it makes you feel like you have any value whatsoever. But it doesn't.... It just makes you look like a hateful idiot who refuses to learn anything new.",
