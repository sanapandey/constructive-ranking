    "selftext": " I (F24) broke up with my boyfriend (M22) because he lusted over online girls.\nI broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years because I found out that over the course of us being together he constantly searched up specific girls he had liked over the years. When I confronted him about it he says that it wasn\u2019t him that had searched up, he keeps lying about it. But I know it was him because it\u2019s not just a one time thing, it\u2019s a weekly habit he searches up these girls on social media almost everyday. And how I know this it\u2019s because it\u2019s on his search history it says the date and timing. We argued about this for a few days until he just ended up saying that it was \u201ctiring \u201c being with me, all because I confront him. I have stated to him before that looking up other girls is considered cheating. Also these girls are mutuals that live in our city. ",

This is likely a bad habit that he picked up before you even met, it's actually an epidemic in young men. Before we were old enough to actually think for ourselves we were given smartphones and access to all kinds of stuff we shouldn't have been looking at. It's a comfort zone for a lot of people, but it's a cycle of self disgust as well.\u00a0\n\n\nI understand not wanting to be with someone who behaves that way, but I'd wager that he doesn't want to be that way either. I worked it out with my girlfriend and we were able to get past it. But it takes a lot of effort to break free from those habits, and unless he's willing to put in the work and acknowledge why it's wrong of him to do, I would move on.\u00a0",

Christ said that if your right eye causes you to sin, cast it away from you, better to lose your right eye than to sin. He doesn't mean it literally of course but the idea is sin is something we fight against that is in our nature, and often we have to make sacrifices and cut things out that lead us into temptations that hurt others or ourselves.
