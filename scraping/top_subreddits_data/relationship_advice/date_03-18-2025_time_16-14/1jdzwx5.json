I\u2019m so tired.\nI shouldn\u2019t have to remind you to brush your teeth, or change your boxers in the morning, or to clean up the messes you make, or try to encourage you to go to a barber to keep your beard tidy and not be like a werewolf. Shouldn\u2019t have to tell you when to make doctors appointments, shouldn\u2019t have to try to convince you to buy clothes that are your size instead of too small, shouldn\u2019t have to help figure out where your money has gone (\u00a3400 that just \u201cdon\u2019t know what I spent it on\u201d) shouldn\u2019t have to wake you up up in the morning or you\u2019ll sleep in until 12. 6 years and I don\u2019t think I can do it anymore. I\u2019m a mother instead of a partner.  People keep saying \u201cit\u2019s a man thing\u201d or that I need to \u201ctrain him up\u201d\u2026\nWhy do I have to be the one to do everything? Why do I have to be the adult and be the one thats depended on ? ",

I was really scared to leave! I didn\u2019t know who I was without him, really. Eventually, I just bit the bullet and did it. I cried every day for a little while. I didn\u2019t know how to be in the world. This went on for about 2 months, and then things started to get better. I started really enjoying my life in a way I hadn\u2019t been able to before because I had been so busy catering to someone else\u2019s needs and emotions and immaturity.\n\nI met my husband about a year later. He was a bit wild and I didn\u2019t really know what my expectations for a partner should be.\n\nThis man has never needed me to parent him. Like yeah sometimes he spend money randomly; so do I. Sometimes he leaves the vacuuming until the next day. But the things you\u2019re talking about? Never. We are able to complement each other and pick up slack when the other needs a break. That\u2019s real partnership.\n\nI cannot tell you how glad I am that I left the earlier relationship. I had no idea how lovely having a partnership could be.\n\nThis was a while ago, and from what I\u2019ve heard, that dating world is insane now. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s scary in that regard, too. But I strongly suggest just getting a glass of wine or cup of tea and just sitting with yourself\u2014 no phone or anything; maybe just a notebook and pen\u2014 and thinking about your life and what you want. Are you happy? Is this relationship viable? If he up and fixed all these tiny issues, would you be happily in love? Do you want to marry this man (if that\u2019s what you eventually want)? What\u2019s keeping him from taking care of himself?\n\nJust think about it. Do that a couple times, spaced a few days apart. You\u2019ll know what to do. \u2764\ufe0f",

It's not your job to parent adult men. Go into future relationships with the assumption that what you see is what you get and the person as you see them now will not change, make your decisions about dating with that framing.

What had the biggest impact though was reading bell hooks' The will to change, and then later Fair Play by Eve Rodsky. Probably motivated by reading an article about emotional and cognitive labour.\n\nSince my late 20s a lot has improved. I brush my teeth every day, I take proper responsibility for tasks and dealing with the kids and so on, I'm on board with the idea mentally. \n\nBut it's no panacea. I still end up leaving some stuff around, my ability to keep track of things is entirely dependent on alarms and lists and calendars. \n\nSo the question is whether you mind this stuff enough to be unable to put up with it forever. Not that it will be this bad forever, but the basic human underneath the discipline and systems is unlikely to change enormously, and any significant change will be internally motivated, not motivated by criticism. \n\nIf I were you I'd give him a sit down talk and explain that you can do this stuff for him any more. That you need him to be clean (mouth, body, clothes), neat, properly dressed and punctual. That you're handing any responsibility for that explicitly back to him. That you're happy to help him with anything he wants help with, like working out lists or routines, but he will have to drive it and be responsible for the result. Don't criticise, don't lay out all your resentment. Just clearly explain the situation and explicitly hand over the responsibility. You're happy to be on the team, but you're not taking that role. \n\n*And then follow through with that*.\n\nStop reminding, stop carrying that load for him, put it all down. Either he picks it up or it's over, you're not picking it up again either way. Resist any urge to criticise. If needed, state where something is contrary to the stated requirements, but don't tell him what needs doing or how.\n\nMany men go from mother to girlfriend (etc) and never actually pick up their own responsibility, and I can tell you it's a hard lesson.",

If I left the mess or his tasks it would just start to stink so bad people would complain about it to me. Of course he was bad news in a lot of other ways as well, that didn't stand out to me until a few years later. I dumped him when he started to repulse me. Should have dumped him after half a year instead. Since that was when he started abusing me. The things I wish I'd known when I was young could fill a book. The smell of those socks still gives me nightmares sometimes.\n\nAnyway. It was super hard and awful for a few months. Then it got better steadily. I have been with my partner for eight years now and my life is unrecognizable. I feel so happy and loved. My man is a really typical \"just guys being dudes\" man who works a blue collar job and wears flannel. He also pulls his weight around the home (I feel like he does more than me) and specifically picks up the tasks that he knows I don't like to do. We had unexpected twins and he is just as much the primary parent as I am. An attentive, doting and loving husband + father. We both work the same amount of hours. I can already see what the healthy role model is doing to my children, just like his parents influenced him (his dad is the baby whisperer and diaper hero of the family). \n\nIt's not a \"man\" thing.

Sometimes a reminder can be helpful and show that you actually care about the person as well. I totally get where you're coming from with not have to police or be a mother to your partner, but sometimes that extra reassurance does help. Especially if your guy has anything like chronic depression or just gets in a bad mentally foggy place. People who have ADHD sometimes also forget these kind of things pretty commonly. I'm not at all saying it's okay that he's not taking care of himself, but just to be a little bit kinder to him in the end.",

He's not here to communicate his side of the situation and we are only getting her side. Imagine only siding with the female in the situation (I am female btw) and completely ignoring the guys feelings and reasons. Seems if it's been long standing then that communication, If any, just isn't working. If she wants to leave she can. I just feel it's more practical to understand the whys before jumping the gun. I'm the same age as the OP and have been in a happy relationship nearly as long.",

The OP has every option to leave if they are uncomfortable with the situation. The fact they have stayed that long with the person means they care about them. Aren't you meant to care for your partner? In sickness and health? Has she even asked why he refuses to do simple health and upkeep options? Has she asked how his mental health is? Is she just blaming it on laziness or is there another reason? Does he take anxiety or depression meds? Does she? You do know what that can do to you right? Even simple tasks like showering and caring for yourself can feel like a mountain. She needs to really get to the route of WHY he's not doing it instead of yelling, Judging or berating him.",

Some days are so bad I can't even get out of bed to brush or shower. Mental health is no joke. If it wasn't for my fiancee I likely wouldn't be here to brush said teeth. Sure, I used the term \"finer things\" incorrectly here, I'll admit that. But, generally the lack of personal hygiene is typically from a poor mental state not just from laziness or unwillingness. There's ALWAYS a reason. As for his mental health YES she IS responsible for his, just as he is responsible for hers.  Maybe my thinking is more empathic and not as harsh as others, but if my guy is suffering and not willing to care for himself I AM communicating to him and finding help. Point blank. A wife, husband or partner makes that commitment the moment they are married or in a long term relationship. Again I state she can leave if it's not working out.  I will be the one to be there to brush his hair when he's down, to wash him when he's too mentally weak to stand on his own and to feed him a home cooked meal when he cannot even stomach the basics. THATS what I'm getting at. There is simply not enough information and context here.  I only bring my age and relationship status up as a point of relatability.",
