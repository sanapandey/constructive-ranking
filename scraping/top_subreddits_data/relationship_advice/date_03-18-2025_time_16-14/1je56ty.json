    "selftext": "For more context, my GF works in the film industry and sometimes has events. She has had lots of relationships in the past and some of them have been through work. She previously told me that she was likely to bump into them from time to time  at events and obviously I accepted there was nothing that can be done about that so that's fine.\n\nThen out of the blue, a few weeks ago, whilst on the phone she asked me if I'd be ok if she went for coffee with her exes if they asked. \n\nI told her that I wasn't really happy with the idea and that I wouldn't feel comfortable but that she can do what she wants. She didn't really seem to understand why I would be bothered and then followed it up by saying they weren't just exes, they were friends. I asked how often she talks to them and she said that she messages a few times a year. The one she seemed most upset about was apparently a good friend after they broke up but they haven't met up in a couple of years. Another she sees at festivals a couple of times a year.\n\nI said that to me that doesn't seem like particularly close friends if she's not in regular communication and that it didn't really make a difference to how I would feel.\n\nAgain however, I said she could do what she wanted and that she'd kind of backed me into a corner out of the blue and maybe I would change my mind if I had time to think on it.\n\nIt got brought up again today as she is going to an event next week and one of her exes is likely to be there. I said that's fine, as long as you're not going for a coffee with him (still maybe a little butt hurt from before). \n\nAnd she really wasn't happy. She got very upset with me and started shouting that it would only be if he asked her (she thinks it's different if she says yes to him than if she asked herself) and that I don't have a right to tell her she can't and also she has apparently googled it and everyone says it's normal and ok. (Hence me going online myself to find out). She says that if he asks her to leave the event so they can talk quietly she would do so.\n\nAgain, I reiterated that she can do what she wants but I wouldn't be comfortable or happy with it and I wasn't sure why she was so forceful in getting me to 'sign off on it'.\n\nI did ask a friend who said that they shared my views but that's just an echo chamber of two.\n\nSo I'm now asking here to see what people's genuine thoughts are. I'll say that I'm not trying to say one of us in particular is necessarily right, but I know how I feel and I'm not comfortable with being told that I should be ok with it. \n\nWhat are your thoughts and how would you have responded?\n\nThanks in advance ",

What's off putting is the level of anger in response to your feelings, which you only offered when asked. As you touched on in the post, it doesn't sound like there's any legitimate reason to spend time together. I'm in touch with my exes in the same capacity she described, yet I don't think we'd ask each other to coffee after a stop and chat at an event. The stop and chat would be enough.",

I would be fine with a coffee once every few years to catch up, especially if they are in the same industry or had mutual friends. My husband is in music, both as a performer and a distributor; there are women in the industry that he casually dated and sees at shows and events. If I had a problem with him socializing with those women, it would severely strain his networking capability.

If I didn't trust him and didn't feel safe assuming best intentions of his choices, we would not be together.\n\n  \nWhich way you lean here depends very much on your own personal experiences and values. If she feels it's fine and you don't, then you may not share sufficient values to continue. That doesn't make you wrong, or her.

So if you already feel the need to control who she has coffee with, either she's not trustworthy, or you have trust issues\u2026 and you need to figure out which it is. Because if it\u2019s her, making her feel bad isn\u2019t going to stop her from cheating. And if it\u2019s you, you\u2019re not being fair making your issues her problem to manage. \n\nI'm an old woman in a 30 year monogamous relationship, and I've liked all of the men I dated for more than a month, or I wouldn\u2019t have kept dating them. But we obviously weren\u2019t long term compatible. Most of the shorter term BFs I lost touch with, but I still have coffee with my ex husband when he's in town, and we've let each other know when big things have happened in our lives. There's another guy I dated 4 decades ago for a couple years, and when we're sharing our family photos, we still include each other. He checks in on how my folks are doing too. And my sweetheart of decades, he'll ask how everyone's doing, and then makes me remember why I picked him. \n\nIt's okay to stay friends with people you loved romantically once you're over them romantically. I don\u2019t know what your relationship with her is like, but it's been five months since she's dated anyone else, so if you\u2019re otherwise happy together and you know you genuinely like each other, don\u2019t make her feel bad for having coffee now and then with guys she's moved on from. They\u2019re just friends catching up. Let her know you were just a little nervous, be interested in how their visit goes in a gossipy way, and move on. But seriously, if you don\u2019t trust her, just let her go. That\u2019s not a healthy way to live.",
