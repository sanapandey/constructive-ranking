Almost bought a used car that was around 30% off expected asking because the seller'd scraped it against a wall and it had big paintwork scuffs on the rear passenger door and quarter panel, but someone else got to it first.\n\nUrsula Vernon (one of my favorite authors) has a procedure when she gets a new vehicle of \"taking the curse off\" by taking a hammer and dinging a couple of body panels, so she doesn't have to sweat scratching it up driving on overgrown country roads.",

And due to copyright, a lot of dupe businesses are pop-ups, I swear my Herman Miller Aeron dupe ,  was around for like a week, no brand. \n\nAnd that's in the office chair world, especially when covid hit and everybody wanted the Aeron, when it comes to like house furniture, there are warehouses full of dupes you can go into, especially in the furniture liquidation.\n\n I'm kind of speaking outside of the question at this point, but if you want a genuine Herman Miller anything for really cheap, That is the place to go because so many offices stop functioning during covid and they couldn't get back up, and there's an undescribable amount of furniture in large quantities being piecemealed. My real Aeron was $35, I just had to go pick it up, it was actually cheaper than the dupe itself",
