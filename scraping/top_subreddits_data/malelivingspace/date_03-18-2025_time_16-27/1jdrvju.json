You're going to have a really difficult time building any relationships with a home in the condition yours is in, and if that is a goal of yours it might be time to reclaim some of your territory. IF not, I hope you're doing well and staying sane/clean in there!\n\n\n\nPersonally, I could not live in this room; I would rather be back in my old Chevy van down by the river (yes i get the joke, but I'm actually serious) I can smell this room through the photo and I just know that wouldn't work for me. Shit, I came home yesterday and someone had put something stank in the garbage and left it open; it was the first thing that hit me when I walked in and I had to clean it out. I've got a really bad reflex for smells, to the point where I vomit as a very literally instant reaction to intense smells like rotting chicken for example. I always power through, but often it comes with a few buckets of puke.\n\nThat being said, you seem like a genuinely caring guy. That post you made about the flies is not for me, but you've got a serious respect for life and that's super fucking rare; so if you're happy here than keep on my dude. However, you also mentioned in another post you're about to be engaging with a new lady friend, I will tell you this my guy: ***If you find a woman that is okay coming back to this house, keep her forever.*** I'm not sure how it is in your country, but women in my country expect to have some place to sit, engage in conversation or a meal/drink, and hopefully at some point will want to exchange some more, horizontal pleasantries. This ***will not*** happen if you're bringing her back to a room/house in this condition.\n\nI want you to do you, and live your best life being as happy as you can man. You seem to have a desire for a relationship; and it's a pretty safe bet that you're going to want a secure, clean and safe area to help cultivate and grow that relationship. Right now your home is not that place. If you want it to be, you've got to reclaim some (not all) territory from your animal brethren, and put in some elbow grease to bring the sights and smells back into acceptable limits. \n\nThat's just my 2 cents brother, but like I said: if you're happy, keep on keeping on. But if you're not happy, or you're wanting something more; it's time to do some work.",
