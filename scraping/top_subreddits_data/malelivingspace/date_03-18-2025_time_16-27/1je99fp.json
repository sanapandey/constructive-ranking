My cousin has a room full of hot wheels hung up on all 4 sections of the wall. I'm talking COVERED.That was something his dad and him did together, they'd go get the newest cars every once in a while. Now it's a sentimental collection for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\nI own a bunch of toys that were given to me by my grandpa as a kid. They're all old and \"childish\". I will never get rid of them because he's passed away and they were gifts. They will always be proudly on display in my room, where they belong. \n\n\n\n Being an adult, I'm sure you can look past the childish appearance of something and realize the value that it holds as a collectors item or sentimental piece.
