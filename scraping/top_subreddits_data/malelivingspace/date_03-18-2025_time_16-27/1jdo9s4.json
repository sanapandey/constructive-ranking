It is entitled \"Naturum De Montum\", roughly translated: Book of the Dead. The book is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. It deals with demons and demon resurrection and those forces which roam the forest and dark bowers of Man's domain. The first few pages warn that these enduring creatures may lie dormant but are never truly dead. They may be recalled to active life through the incantations presented in this book. It is through the recitation of these passages that the demons are given license to possess the living.",

Being a steam sauna also means that the chair is only absorbing the heat from the ambient air, and isn't being heated directly by infrared. It's small, so the air is gonna get up to temp long before the chair starts to get equally as hot. Even if he preheats it, sitting on a 120ish degree thin metal chair might be uncomfortable for a bit, but it will quickly cool down after coming into contact with your body, and probably won't stay hot long enough to burn you. \n\nIt's still literally the worst material for a sauna chair, so it's a valid question, but it's not quite as bad as you might think.",

That broke the barrier. Years later when we sold that house, we made a decent chunk of equity on it.
