The reason given is not about stating that you're gay or straight in your posts or titles, its that constructive discussion has fallen off a cliff and now is mostly shitposting comments within the majority of posts. We'd like to see if this makes discussions a more productive space to improve your personal homes. Much love to the gay, straight and anything in between members of the community. Let's give it a swing, a try, an experiment.",

Now is one of the worst times to be implementing something like this Mod Team. \n\nI understand that people do shitposting on here, but that's been the case in this subreddit way before the \"I'm sharing my identity with my living space\" trend started. \n\nA living space is a reflection of a person. This rule basically tells LGBT+ men that they are not allowed to openly exist in this subreddit for a month (or possibly longer), because some people like to go off topic and troll. Now imagine if this trend had started with people sharing their race or ethnicity with their living space on here and the Mod Team decided that they now can't exist in this subreddit for a month.\n\nI know I probably sound crazy to you, but as someone who has been a victim of homophobia their whole life, fighting for the right to be allowed to exist and be treated with the same rights as everyone else is a never-ending battle.",

You can also have funny conversations without sharing what you like to do with your genitals.\n\nThe \"meme\" was funny the first week or month but then started to seem like a way to push some political agenda or something like that. \nAttention: I'm not saying that i am against that agenda but this is not the context for that. \nThere are people that just like to scroll cool images of beautiful man spaces and occasionally look at some cool suggestions in the comments.\n\nAccusing random people about being homophobic or bigot is a part of the problem and it's the reason why the woke movement is losing attraction and a part of the reasons why Trump won: moderate people started to look at them as spoiled paranoid know-it-all kids and decided to vote for someone else.\n\nSo before accusing (or ironically imply) that someone you don't know is something bad like a homophobic think it twice: am i really helping or am i causing useless tension?\n\n\nWhen you say \"I would actually respect it more if you were openly homophobic\" to a moderate person who's not homophobic, the effect is that of a manhunt.

If you want to make a rule it doesn\u2019t matter if people like it or not, just say \u201cwe don\u2019t like it don\u2019t do it\u201d. An explanation isn\u2019t owed. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to reconcile that it\u2019s impacted constructive discussion or calling it all shit posting because the posts with two pictures and no engagement almost universally seem to be free of sexual orientation in the title. Even today, it\u2019s literally front and center. The ones with 900 interesting conversations happening  and tons of photo content seem to be the inverse.\n\nI\u2019m just saying you don\u2019t need to give an explanation. If messages from people saying \u201ctalking about gay stuff is gross\u201d and it just rubs you the wrong way, or is annoying,add it to the rules. \n\nThis eeems like a good start but it also seems like the experiments and discussions will continue forever until the majority of the sub is on board with the decision. Maybe just doing it and saying \u201cdeal\u201d is the better way to go?\n\nEvery time I see a \u201cdiscussion\u201d talking about how I\u2019m not allowed to talk about my sexuality in a post title, see a response that makes an excellent argument for it, but then it\u2019s brought up again basically saying \u201care you suuuuuurre? Lots of people message  saying they don\u2019t like it\u201d it just feels very futile to explain all the positive experiences or the sense of community it\u2019s made people feel  was a waste of time for them to articulate.",

He one of my best buds, so I'm not goina press the subject, but if it can be said that we won't be totally roasted, he might fully agree. He looks at all this stuff and he knows how bad his situation looks. He cleans up randomly, but I know for a fact he is in a slump right now and a good example.
