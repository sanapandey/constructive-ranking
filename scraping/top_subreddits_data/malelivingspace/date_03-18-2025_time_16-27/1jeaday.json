    "selftext": "some friends of mine came to visit last night before they move out of state and one of them that's really into what I do with my spaces mentioned this sub so I came to check things out and figured I'd share my current space along with a *titanic* info dump on how my brain is wired for this stuff in case that's helpful to anyone. right off the bat I feel like I gotta mention if the sectional in our living room looks a little weird it's because I built it with a former roommate for outdoors at our previous house but it was too big for our patio where I moved so instead of buying a new couch like I planned to when I moved here I just kept the cushions from our old couch and put it inside.\n\n1. I guess that brings me to my first piece of advice: **if you've got the space to build your own stuff, don't be afraid to try.** I threw together a lot of the furniture I have like that sectional, most of the wooden stuff on our patio, the ceiling light fixtures in the living room and my studio, the coffee table I made huge as hell specifically to have space for doing game nights, the desk in my studio, etc. The only power tools I have are a circular saw, drill, and orbital sander. All of them were cheap models. I rarely draft plans for what I do and just kind of measure as I go with an idea in my head. If I can do it, you absolutely can. Scrolled past a post where someone was asking if people posting in this sub were rich but I'm absolutely not, I do freelance graphic design and compose music for tiny indie games (my money goes to investing in my studio gear when I can spare it). I've got like $90 to my name right now. You can save a lot of money going the DIY route if you're able to.\n2. Second piece of advice which won't be shocking after seeing my pictures is **bring some plants into your space**. I feel like as Things That Are Alive, it's not great for our brains to be disconnected from nature. If you're bad with plants you can always get some fake ones. If you just need a helping hand you can get grow lights with timers and look up self-watering hydro spikes (the kind with a little tube attached to them to put in a water container) so the plant can water itself as long as you keep the water container filled. This takes some guesswork out of keeping plants happy and also means you don't have to worry about your plants if you go on vacation. Just make sure if you have a pet the plants you want either aren't toxic to your pet (e.g. Pothos/Devil's Ivy is toxic to dogs and cats) or you can put them where your pet can't reach them.\n3. Third piece of advice is **indirect lighting will do a lot for your space**. I don't think this is any more unique of a tip than \"go get plants\" but it's worth repeating because nice lighting does *a ton* of heavy lifting for making a space look more inviting or intimate. Maybe it feels overdone to go with rice paper floor lamps with sub 3k Kelvin bulbs but I'm telling you dude, you grab some of those amber tinted fake edison LED bulbs and put them somewhere that's not a ceiling fan directly overhead and you're gonna feel cozy as hell. If you're handy, imo track lighting is great for if you want overhead lighting but with the flexibility of having it be more directional and diffuse. The track lights attached to the ceiling baffle I made for my studio as well as the LED strips on the faux exposed joists I put in my bathroom have temperature control so if warm light makes you sleepy and you need to be more alert during the day to work from home but want that warm soft vibe when you clock out, lights with temp controls are awesome.\n4. Advice #4: Doing a 2 in one here. **Textiles are your friend/echo is not**. Not only do things like throw blankets and rugs add a tactile appeal to your space but also if you've also got a fairly blank canvas, something that might throw you off with your space is the echo from all the reflective surfaces. That kind of reinforces that you're in a fairly empty room and I think it can be subconsciously unsettling. The bummer about this is I feel like decent rugs can be really damn expensive but you can always take baby steps and get some reasonably priced drapes and a throw blanket to start with. Furniture obviously can help with this but that's a much pricier solution to dampening sound reflections that you may not have room for. Hell, if you're into the look of the baffling I made for my studio's ceiling and the one on the wall my banjo, mandolin, and ukulele are hanging from, those are made out of 1\"x2\"x8' furring strips from Home Depot which as of this post are only $1.50 each. This starts to blend into the next bit of advice I was going to drop but not only can these be great for dampening sound and looking cool, they also provide a surface for you to screw things to without leaving tons of holes in the wall. All those instruments and extra effect pedals I have are hanging off of something that has only 3 screws going into studs. Same with that long guitar hanger I threw together. That's 10 guitars hanging off of only 3 screws in studs (just make sure you use good screws lol). Last bit on this one is I don't think it typically looks great to have rugs right up against the wall/corner if you can get them in the visual center of a space. The one in my studio is only like that so I have room to roll my chair around. Rules for thee, not for me.\n5. Advice #5. **Consider the materials in your space. Also wood, wood kicks ass.** If you get into architecture and interior design youtube, a word you'll likely hear a lot is \"materiality\" which, kinda self-explanatory here, is basically just talking about the materials used in a space. This is somewhat of an amalgamation of a lot of what I've already said but yeah. If you're not rolling in cash to build your own place and think about materiality in the context of how a space is built, for example with lots of polished concrete or whatever, you can still apply this to what you do with a preexisting home. What are the materials in your space, what can you add? Is there a lot of plastic and metal? Those can work as accent parts of what you have (for example, the hairpin legs on the small side tables I have), but I think a space can feel infinitely more comfortable when you start thinking about more organic materiality. I've already hyped up textiles and wood but I'm reinforcing that here. Get or build some wood furniture.\n\nMiscellaneous stuff: jumping off that last bit of advice, a great style you can google for ideas is **Japandi;** a portmanteau of *Japa*nese and Sc*andi*navian. It blends the clean, simple minimalism and functionality of Scandinavian design with the emphasis on natural/organic materiality from Japanese design. It's all over the place but with good reason; it works. I think the biggest cornerstones of my taste are Japandi, Tropical Modernism and Boho/Bohemian (but boho in a tasteful Moroccan decor way, not in the cluttered hippie way). Maybe those things aren't your thing but you might still get some ideas to pull from them with some image or video searches.\n\nIf you're stumped for what to put on your walls on a budget you can look up tapestries with other keywords for things you like. These days that'll get you a big design on lightweight fabric that only costs $10-$30 rather than an ornate illuminated historical depiction hand woven by a monk or whatever. If you like the national park posters I have and want to get something like that that has nice minimal nature designs on it, I get those from [https://thelandmarkproject.com](https://thelandmarkproject.com)\n\nBonus lighting tip related to the last picture in the set I've got here: can't get a good picture during the day but those cheap ass sunset projection lamps everyone was promoting on viral posts 5 years ago actually go pretty hard shining through plants. Huge hack for anyone trying to give their space golden hour energy along with lights that have a 2000 Kelvin temperature or lower.\n\nNever Too Small, The Local Project, and Open Plan are great youtube channels for seeing well designed spaces. TLP and OP are generally bougie rich people houses but most of them hired designers with good taste so you can still rip vibes and ideas from them. If nothing else they always have really chill music so it's great background noise haha.\n\nAnyway that's it I guess, sorry this is so *ridiculously* long, my ADHD took over and uhhhh here we are. Thanks for reading all of this if you did, I hope it was helpful and didn't come off as patronizing with anything that might be well trodden ground. My space isn't quite the ideal I have in mind for it but I'm into where it is with the limitations of my income and the space (especially since the studio has to be somewhat functional). Good luck with your places!",

The baffle in my studio is WAY too heavy for that though so it's screwed into the ceiling joists that the drywall is attached to. Take no risks especially with ceilings and get yourself a stud finder (preferably one that can detect power so you don't accidentally drill into an electrical conduit and zap yourself), and make sure you're tapping into a stud or joist. Drywall can be up to 5/8\" thick so I'd advise you make sure whatever screw or screw hook you use is at least 1 1/2\" long so you know it's actually going into the stud/joist.",
