    "selftext": "My wife and I moved here about a year ago, and this is the first room that we fully finished. \n\nI'm a painter and a product designer, so while I didn't have any formal training in interior design, I have some soft skills in the visual arts area that carry over pretty well. Unlike most couples, I'm the guy doing most of the decorating around the house. It's fun for me to do, and fun for her to watch.\n\nThe theme here was \"retro travel\", and started at our previous rental, where we had the idea of having a giant world map where my wife and I could mark our travels down. We started hanging up little keychains from every place we traveled to, with the keychains reminding us about something memorable from that trip, like; \n\n-a little pillow from an Airbnb in Canada with bedding that smelled so heavily like body odor that we bought new sheets for the room\n\n-mini brake rotors to remind us of a taxi car driver in Spain that gunned it around the countryside \n\n-a chicken from Hawaii, because we were surprised at how many wild chickens we saw around the islands \n\nWe also love theme parks and theming in general, so I took a lot of inspiration from pop culture depictions of travel and adventure (think Indiana Jones, the Mummy, Adventureland)",
