I think I paid $200 for the speakers. \n\nYou can find some good stuff on Facebook marketplace and OfferUp. Usually from people moving or garage sales.\n\nI then found a sale on a Klipsch 5.1 surround setup and used the 4 corner speakers as height speakers (this also got me 1 subwoofer and an upgraded center speaker).\n\nI then SLOWLY upgraded the 4 tower speakers, added side speakers, added the second channel subwoofer. Once I had a full set of decent speakers, I upgraded my speaker wire to OFC (pure oxygen free copper). The upgraded speaker wire made a noticeable difference in sound. To be honest, I still want to upgrade to even better speakers.\n\nBelieve me, it\u2019s WORTH IT!",
