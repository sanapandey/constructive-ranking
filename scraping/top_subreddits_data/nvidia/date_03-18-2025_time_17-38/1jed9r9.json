            "body": "Performance is around 30+ FPS in my experience on the low render preset, so completely playable if you're okay with 30 FPS. You can technically get 60 FPS if you turn off ray reconstruction, but the image is insanely noisy otherwise and looks really bad. Regardless, I wanted to show off how impressive both DLSS 4 Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction are for a GPU that isn't in the specs sheet to run this game.\n\nEdit: Not too sure why the first image is really blurry, but the others are just fine. Some graininess is noticeable since it's a still image, but playing in motion it's hardly noticeable other than on fire and smoke effects.\n\nEdit 2: This is actually on the perform preset since Ray Reconstruction can't be used on Ultra Performance. I was mistaken since the option was still selected so I assumed that RR just gave a resolution bump as well.",
