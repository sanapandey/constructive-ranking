    "selftext": "Hey everyone! Another round of invites just went out (Tuesday, 12:30 est). The exciting thing about this wave is that they seem to also be going out to non-4090 owners! I received an invite and I own a 3080. I registered within the first hour the sign-ups went live. Other than that, I can't think of anything special.\n\nDid other non-4090 owners receive invites? I'm very excited, as I thought it would be months before I would be eligible for a 5090FE!\n\nEdit: Also my Nvidia account is nine years old, and I've used GeForce Experience (now Nvidia App) and GeForce Broadcast. I also signed up for GTC (virtually) using my Nvidia account, so maybe that gave me an edge?",

Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if verification put you into a priority tier, then Nvidia lotteries for each tier as available. We don\u2019t know the full extent of telemetry data used, so there could be many factors in verification including current card ownership and maybe even what you play and for how long.",

It's probably more that the 3090 and 4090 owners were willing to pony up the big bucks for the 5090, so they signed up for that one, and the 3080 and 4080 owners were wanting to stay in the xx80 range, so they signed up for that one, etc. I think it's just a numbers game and the people we're seeing signing up for these cards, by and large (meaning not all the time, but usually) are the ones who have been in the same tier of GPU in the past",
