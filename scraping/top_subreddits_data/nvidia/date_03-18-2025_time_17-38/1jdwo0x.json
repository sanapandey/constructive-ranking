I\u2019m getting heavily into overclocking and currently waiting for various custom water loop parts to water block the cpu, but for now here is how she sits. I\u2019m glad with my purchases, no buyers remorse, and I\u2019m perfectly fine financially before anyone tries to pocket watch lmao. Just wanted to share this build. This motherboard is a beast when it comes to supporting CPU overclocking. Able to hit 5.71Ghz on the cpu and completely stable. Boot times could be better but that\u2019s typical AM5 lmao. \n\nFull specs: Ryzen 7 9800X3D / Asus Rog astral 5090 OC / MSI Meg x870e godlike / Corsair RM1200X psu / 4Tb Crucial T705 / 64Gb G.Skill trident z5 neo DDR5 Ram / Arctic LF3 360MM Aio / Lian li wireless reverse blade LCD fans / Lian li uni infinity fans / Hyte y70 case ",

OP here might be one of like 1000 people worldwide who build a setup that in total costs around $10k and uses it for gaming. The vast majority of such builds are multi purpose for video editing and gaming. Or AI and gaming etc. Because you can build the best possible gaming system, monitor included, for way less than $10k. It just shows how completely out of touch Jensen and by extension Nvidia has become. It's infuriating. But snarking out on you here is pretty lame. So sorry.\u00a0",

Plus I would ultimately be paying $300-400 for the upgrade after selling my Z790 Extreme which would be the regular cost of a mid-tier motherboard.",
