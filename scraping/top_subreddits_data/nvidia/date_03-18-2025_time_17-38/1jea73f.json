If you already have the top of the line card, odds are you are financially well off and this is your hobby, and you're not gonna have to put much into dropping 2k to have the latest and greatest again. Doesn't really make sense to apply logic to purchasing a 2k GPU. Obviously there's no real way of knowing but I'd wager many 5090 purchasers are coming from a 4090.",

Simply because the kindof people that want to get a 5090 will tend to be the kindof people that got a 4090, whereas someone on an xx70 card would likely want to get a  newer xx70 card for the same reason they got their current one, budgetary reasons.",

What we're seeing correlates far too strongly, especially taking into account the fact that people can lie or leave out pertinent information.\n\nIf Nvidia **was** only sending 5090 priority access emails to people with a 4090 registered to their account, I would expect we'd have more inaccurate data points reported that contradict that, simply because people are people. In this thread we already have several people suddenly reporting that they're getting these emails despite not having 4090s, and at least personally, I haven't seen a single instance of that until now.\n\nAs ad-hoc and non-specific the data collection might be, there's a really strong trend I'm seeing here.
