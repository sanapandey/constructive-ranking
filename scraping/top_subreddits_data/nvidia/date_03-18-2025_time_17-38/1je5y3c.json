On max settings in the normal Alt + X menu (didn't dive into the additional developer menu), DLSS Quality gave above 60fps at 1440p. Around 80fps on DLSS Balanced.\n\nFor framegen, I agree with this article that 2x looked the best. 3x and 4x has some noticeable artifacts. at 1440p 2x framegen and DLSS balanced gave around 140 fps and very useable 35-45ms PC latency on the nvidia overlay. \n\nAfter looking at benchmarks i thought it might be rough, but its running really good so try it yourself. if u have 4070ti super or better, i think you'll have a good experience at 1440p with dlss. Also no shader/traversal stuttering like a lot of modern games, it still does have the few seconds loading at set points in the level though like the original HL2.",

TVs used for showcase 99 % of the time are not showing a static image (but a short movie to show how good the color and contrast can reproduce the display), so the risk of burn-in is low with non-static images, but that is not a valid point to say that OLEDs burn-in is a \"old news\".",
