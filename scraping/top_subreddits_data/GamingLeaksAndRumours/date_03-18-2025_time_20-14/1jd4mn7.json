And the \"main\" game is still reasonably popular/successful too, though OSRS is more active.\n\nI recently picked up OSRS after nearly 20 years since being into RSC/RS2 as a kid. It's honestly a fun time, and it has a super active community on Twitch and YouTube as well. I got my wife into an amazing series on YouTube called Gielenor Games, which is a sort of Survivor homage that takes place in OSRS with a bunch of content creators as contestants. It's absolutely top tier editing and presentation, with some super entertaining content and personalities. She has never played RS in any form but she is just as into the series as I am. (For anyone potentially interested, and I do highly recommend it, I'd suggest starting with Season 3 and 4, and if you like them, you can go back to 1 and 2 after.)\n\nAs for this new game, I don't have strong thoughts really. Jagex haven't fared well with other non-RS ventures in the past, but I can see a RS-themed survival game doing well if it's made with care and deliberation. I believe it's in alpha right now, and while not much is being shared publicly, it does sound like there's some potential here.",
