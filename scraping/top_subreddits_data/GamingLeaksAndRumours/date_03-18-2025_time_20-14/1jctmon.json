Some enemies can impale Hinako in neck or rip her face apart. There is gore in cutscenes, burning characters alive, entrails, amputation and partial nudity.  \n  \nSeems like this rating appeared day after the Transmission stream reveal but I didn't see anyone mention it.  \nSurprisingly, South Korea doesn't seem to have rating for it yet, but we know Japan gave it CERO:Z \n\nFor Comparison Silent Hill 2 Remake got rated on April 1st on ESRB (Feb 29 in South Korea) and came out at the end of September, so it's possible SHf might be a Q3 2025 game, getting rated 2 months earlier we could be seeing a July or maybe August release date",

Annapurna said that they will honor all existing contracts still when all of this went down. \n\nBut you never know, I guess. I'm sure a lot of stuff in the works and overseen by Annapurna got pushed back and delayed (internally) due to the sudden nature of that whole ordeal",

But most importantly what I want to say and this is pretty much a fact, historically when game gets ESRB/PEGI it comes out 2-8 months later, you can easily check this yourself",
