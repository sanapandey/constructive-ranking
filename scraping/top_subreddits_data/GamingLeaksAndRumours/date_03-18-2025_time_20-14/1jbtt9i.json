There are a lot that you can do even when your teammates aren't coopareting.\n\nFor the wormfaces, you can stun them with fire damage and use boluses for the deathblight but that depend on your drops. Honestly most times we usually sprint past the enemies to the Wormface boss and spam our ults and weapon arts to take it down fast. Or we would simply ignore the ruins.",
