As per him, the game\u2019s true unveiling at the upcoming presentation will \u201cblow everything else in the direct out of the water\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile Reilly cautioned that Nintendo is constantly tweaking its Direct presentations right down to the last minute, as of now, he is 90% certain that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be make an appearance. Going by his choice of words, it seems that the game will be showcased in a major way.\n\nIf Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, a cross-gen release, will be the most impressive title shown during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the next-gen version has to have considerable graphical upgrades over the version that runs on the aging Switch hardware. It\u2019s possible that the extra horsepower of the Switch 2 is used not only to boost image quality and frame rate, but also to add modern features, such as ray traced reflections. Only time will tell whether this is the case, however.\n\nOther first-party titles expected to be showcased during next month\u2019s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct include a new 3D Mario platformer, the already teased Mario Kart 9, and a new Super Smash Bros game. The brief Mario Kart 9 teaser showed a total of 24 players/characters racing away across the circuit. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe limited the headcount to up to 12 players/characters. The sequel appears to double this count, owing to the greater processing power available on the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is set to happen on April 2, 2025.\u201d",

Metroid, especially Super, especially Prime, Hunters, Dread, and admittedly even Other M. (Good graphics and engineering does not necessarily good gameplay make.) \n\nPrime is chock full of good engineering that work so well you might not ever appreciate it. (Think about all the third person platforming games with cameras which suck, and then think about how it was never a problem with the morph ball through all the Prime games. [Interview here](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/ex-retro-studios-devs-laud-metroid-primes-camera-system). Like, sure it had some of the best graphics on a Gamecube game, but it was also chock full of fantastically engineered gameplay systems.\n\nZoid had some good posts on Twitter that I can't see anymore given the Musk changes, which is a shame, because they had a great series of retrospectives leading up to the 20-year anniversary. [Some of them are cited in this post at least.](https://www.gamesradar.com/metroid-prime-devs-reveal-the-games-weirdest-secrets/)\n\nRetro Studios still has a ton of their original talent who now have 20 more years of experience.\n\nSo, **having no insider knowledge,** it's a no-brainer that Prime 4 will be gorgeous. I don't need contacts at Retro; I could've told you this in 2019.\n\n... That said, the \"Prime 4 will blow everything else out of the water\" might be overselling it. Any bit of Prime 4 will be my personal highlight, but I admit the appeal is niche. I can't see Prime 4 beating a new Smash, a new Mario Kart, or a new 3D Mario for petes sake.\n\n**TLDR: I think it's speculation, but an easy guess to make. Prime 4 is going to be gorgeous because Retro is really really good at what they do.**",

MP1, 2, 3 full remasters and then a release of 4 would probably oversaturate the market.",

Metroid especially in 3D has always been positioned as a big console showpiece even on limited hardware, even Dread recently was timed to launch with the Switch OLED and the backgrounds in that game really pop on that display, so even if it's just on base Switch, it's probably going to be a looker anyway. I still think OG Metroid Prime even being on GameCube still looks graphically superior to stuff that came out around that same time like Halo CE or Morrowind",

Graphically it's definitely not the best thing the Xbox turned out as even Halo 2 was a major step up just in terms of the details of characters and weapons, but it was obviously very impressive for its day",

And then for Smash 4 obviously that didn't actually begin development until 2012 since it was announced while Sakurai was still doing Kid Icarus Uprising, and add onto that bringing Bandai Namco as a partner.\n\nHow fast a new Smash game takes to come out is going to depend on if Sakurai's working on literally anything else at the moment, as SSB4 and Ultimate were basically one huge development period with pretty much no break, which is why the release turnout was way faster for Ultimate in general. He started early work on Ultimate while he was still doing SSB4's DLC and even said himself he submitted his project plan to Nintendo immediately after the last Direct they did for Smash 4 where they dropped Cloud and announced Corrin/Bayonetta",

Every Smash game so far has been developed in under a 3-year timespan - nothing's approached the 13 months of Melee since then, but at most they're just shy of 3 years, as they were with Ultimate. I don't expect to see it in April, but it technically isn't impossible that they would aim for this year. I think they'll give it more time in the oven, though, to account for longer development in general and making sure they can avoid too many cuts.

Dread also had a massive marketing campaign behind it, with billboard advertisements, a weekly \"Dread Report\" release on Nintendo's website, and lots of Youtube trailers, with even one of the Japanese trailers having [licensed rock music created for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLIAewt6Cqs)\n\nFinally, Dread released in an extremely favorable release window in early October 2021, with no other major releases coming out near it and at a mature period in the Switch's lifespan where it was not too old or too new. This is important because many previous Metroid games were crippled by these factors:\n\n- Super Metroid released late in the SNES's life when many expected the system to be slowing down\n\n- Prime 2 released in Nov 2004 and was sunk because it was a first-party prestige title competing against many other prestige titles from competitor companies. It came out in the middle of the time when GTA: San Andreas, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, and Metal Gear Solid 3 all released.\n\n- Prime 3 released too early in the Wii's cycle and was kneecapped by also having to be a tech demo for the system, hence all the obnoxious Wii-mote actions embedded in the game.\n\n- Samus Returns released way, *way* too late in the 3DS's life six months after the Switch had come out\n\nWith all these factors, I can see why Nintendo wouldn't be too happy selling only 3 million copies.",

Even Skyward Sword on the Wii had a big drop off from how well TP did and actually ended up selling more on Switch than it ever did on its original console\n\nAnd Metroid I think just functions as a game that could sell the hook of a new system the same way Breath of the Wild made the novelty of having a big open world game on a handheld a huge selling point. Prime's always been a big showpiece for whatever console it's on so something that looks as good or better than even Prime Remastered on a more performant Switch could be something they can play up anyway, especially if they also enable the mouse mode for aiming and that could be something they show off the same way they made a big deal about the Wii Pointer being used for shooters on that system",

Ocarina sold really well and then outside Twilight Princess each subsequent game just sold considerably worse than its predecessor until the recent ones. Again, most of them came out on Nintendo's weakest-selling consoles and that naturally limited the audience for them, or in Skyward's case, the motion controls and complaints about its linearity probably turned more people away from it to begin with\n\nAlso Zelda is absolutely not their second best seller. It's still well below the numbers that Mario and Pokemon pull in and it's probably even below Smash and Animal Crossing now as well. The Switch gen was like the first time since the SNES days that Zelda was actually pulling in sales comparable to all of those other games",

It doesn't fit with how Nintendo handles launch titles lately (they pretty consistently have aimed for 3 games since around the DS, at least in one region of the world, with one being a big core title, one being a new IP, and one generally being either a smaller game using a dormant IP like Excite Truck or Pilotwings Resort or another new IP like Snipperclips), and with Mario Kart being the one game they've shown off already, it is extremely likely it's the intended core title of the bunch. Metroid is also very niche in Japan, and would only suffer from going up against what's almost certainly going to be the Switch 2's best-selling game with at most 2 months of proper promotion. But there's going to be a lot of buzz about anything they release on Switch 2 early on, and so if it's out 3-4 months after the Switch 2 Direct and 1-2 after launch, it will likely get more eyes on it than at any other time.",

Might not happen here but it's definitely a Year 2 or 3 release. Smash is way too big and for a lot of people, basically the only reason to buy Nintendo consoles even if they're not interested in any of the other games. These games sell way too well for them to just say it's okay to just skip a gen or rely on Ultimate for several more years. MK8D exists more out of necessity as it's also very uncharacteristic of Nintendo to not just re-release an old game in a series without a new game also in the same gen, but especially to support a game as old as MK8 is like it's basically a new game again. Not to mention Ultimate not only doesn't need to be re-released since it's going to be playable as is on Switch 2, but re-releasing it would also require going through all the other third-parties for copyright stuff and that's probably just never going to happen",
