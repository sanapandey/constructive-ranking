I know people like to say JRPGs (or games in general) don't sell on Xbox, but technically speaking, it may make more sense for Atlus to partner with Xbox for marketing rights than with PlayStation. \n\nThink about it. If Sony had the marketing rights to Persona 3 Reload, as an example, the game would have probably sold considerably worse on Xbox and PC than it otherwise would have. Persona has historically been a PlayStation exclusive series, and for Atlus to take a Sony marketing deal with the first multiplatform mainline installment in the series would be kinda counterintuitive because it would have de-incentivised sales on non-PS platforms. If all the marketing for the game was PS-only, casuals would have assumed that it's a PS exclusive, like, you know, every prior game in the series.\n\nThat doesn't happen with Xbox, though.  I don't think the Xbox marketing for the games negatively impacted PS sales in the slightest because no one thought Persona was an Xbox exclusive. It probably did, however, cause more Xbox and PC players to buy the game, cuz they were made aware of Persona going multiplatform.",
