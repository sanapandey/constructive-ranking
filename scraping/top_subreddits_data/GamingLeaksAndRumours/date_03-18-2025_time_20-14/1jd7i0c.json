    "selftext": ">The thing I think people will realize when RE9 is revealed is the reason this game is taking so long is because it's like a big reinvention of the series, to the same level as RE4 & RE7. It's not going to play just like RE7/RE8 or the Remakes, it's trying new things & very ambitious. It will almost definitely be revealed this year, so just hold tight.\n\n[https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1901499663741755853](https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1901499663741755853)",

Oh no, now I have to play a tedious game of Ring-Around-The-Rosie because the devs didn't want to commit to a pure Puzzle game. Oh no, I'm playing a digital game of \"The Floor Is Lava.\" Not like Mario ROM Hacks haven't done that before.  \nMy own reflection and current world events are more scarier than what Amnesia offers.\n\nRemoving combat from a horror game doesn't enhance it. It actually devalues the game because the devs don't have hopes in the \"Scary\" value of their game. Or they didn't want to make a pure \"Puzzle\" game.\n\nOG RE3:Nemesis is the perfect example of a good Horror game. Nemesis is described as an Unstoppable creature. Video Games condition players to \"If It Bleeds, It Dies.\" Nemesis can be taken down, sure. But Nemesis **Does Not Stay Down**. It creates a genuine mix between if a player should flee to conserve resources, or fight to buy yourself time. THAT is Horror. Sure, repeat playthroughs lessens that initial \"Horror.\" But even then, the feeling that Nemesis does what's advertised, of being an Unstoppable monster, lingered through the medium for a reason.\n\nHeck Silent Hill 2's Pyramid Head is also a fine example for different reasons. It is a creature meant to punish James for what he's done, unfaltering and unfazed. But at the same twisted time, it's a disturbing guardian. It kills Maria because Maria is a distraction for James, and Pyramid Head needs James to learn the lesson. It pursues James to remind him that he can only run so far, that inevitably, he will get what's coming to him. Fighting back does cause it to flee, but it can't truly be stopped until the purpose is done. Which is why Pyramid Head is a fine example of the Unstoppable Monster alongside Nemesis.\n\nBoth of these examples are how Combat can enhance Horror, narrative, and gameplay. Pyramid Head and Nemesis are out there. You can only pause it. You can't stop it until you're properly ready.\n\nAmnesia....What does it offer? Jumpscares. I don't know why I should be afraid of the things. And \"Because the Game says I should be\" doesn't work. Fighting back is always a viable option. But I can't do that in Amnesia because The Developers arbitrarily decided not to include it.\n\nHell Apex Legends' older \"Fight or Fright\" event was scarier than Amnesia. And it's a Battle Royale FPS game, far and away from the Horror genre full stop.",

Has big opener areas with a lot of secrets, epic battles, cool monsters, it's scary, still has linear sections and the best of all its super immersive.\n\nIt's would not be hard to implement puzzles, it's would be a proper evolution to re4 remake.\n\nIf resident evil haven't evolve so much it would not be where it is today probably would not be alive. Of course I don't want them to go to space or some shit like that (just look at dinocrisis \ud83d\ude2d)",

Then her name was revealed, and he said she was meant to be Wesker in prior iterations, until the art director spoke on it and did not mention that she was ever anything else other than Lady D.\n\nHe also peddled that some guy from Resistance was going to be in the game, then they showed Heisenberg in the trailer and he said that was it, then they said his name and he completely abandoned the idea.\n\nHe then backtracked on everything and said that all of the things he had leaked about it were actually from ANOTHER game entirely, said that it was going to be released within a year of RE8 (this was after 8 was already fully public) and also said all of this\u00a0[was going to be a Switch timed exclusive](https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1360760157936914443).\n\nAlso, I still remember when the girl from Resident Evil 7 was called \"Camile\" and that RE3Remake was so large it needed a subway system fast-travel just to get around (lmfao).\n\nEvery guess this guy does is stuff he can backpeddle on, which is why since his humiliatingly stupid tirade about how RE8 was actually completely non-functional on a PS5 he just stopped speaking in specifics because people immediately screenshot what he says. Everything else he \"correctly\" guesses is either stuff that just happens to turn out real -- and it's always braindead stuff like, \"The next RE remake is RE4\" -- or it's stuff that Jesse from Biohazard Declassified leaks first, and he just repeats it.\"",
