I noticed I gave up on them a lot quicker than I would have if I bought them. (Maybe that's a good thing...) Then Jedi Survivor released mid my month so I scrambled to get through that. Still though for $15 it was a helluva value but I wouldn't want to live like that if that makes sense.\n\nReally though, I think the original comment was just firing a console war shot.",

I'd rather buy the games that i am wanting physical, as they are never full price rrp here anyway, and actually own the games to play whenever I like with out having to pay a continuously rising subscription to rent them. Not cost effective in my books. I don't play every single game that comes out just because. I don't have the time.",

For example, new Doom comes soon, so I go to grocery store and pick card with 1 month Game Pass code for 15\u20ac and will beat shit out of Doom during those 30 days and while doing that I easily complete South of Midnight also, 45\u20ac. Compared to 125\u20ac they ask for those, I see 15\u20ac extremely cost effective.",

No possibility of paying for a yearly membership so you pay about 300$ a year to play on gamepass. PS+ offer yearly subscription for 129$ a year during sales. I prefer paying for yearly ps+ and buying some games I want vs paying 300 a year on xbox and supporting an american brand",

Try comparing the sale prices of both and make sure you're comparing the highest tier of both subscriptions too.\n\n\nThe actual determining factor should be the games you play. If you're a casual gamer who only plays a couple games a year then neither subscription is going to be good for you. However, if you play a lot of games then both subscriptions can be good.\n\n\nIf you're interested in the games releasing day one on GamePass then it's a no brainer unless you need to own the games.\u00a0Personally I've played/will play Indiana Jones, Avowed, Ninja Gaiden 2, Ninja Gaiden 4, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Doom: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, The Outer Worlds 2, the rumored Oblivion remaster/remake, and a handful of smaller games all on day one via GamePass. I also own a PS5 but if I wanted to play all of those games on it on day one I would have to pay over $600 for them. That's only one year of games too. Over the course of a generation it's possible to save thousands of dollars by playing games through subscriptions instead of buying them. Again though, if you care about owning the games or you don't play many games then that's different.",
