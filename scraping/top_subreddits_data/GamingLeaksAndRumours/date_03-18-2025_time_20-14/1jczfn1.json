It's almost time for some new news about what Nintendo's doing over there and it's honestly one of the most exciting times for me. It's always such a great time when we get another round of Zelda and Mario. So, here's the question I'm prompting:\n\n**What major franchises do we think are gonna launch day and date with the Switch 2? Mario and Zelda? Metroid? Gamecube NSO??

            "body": "Was looking at the [breakdown of Nintendo studios](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/s/a3E6fOsoTN) from a few months back in anticipation of the Switch 2 Direct, here\u2019s the studios that I think have a shot of revealing something new and releasing them this year\n \n- EPD9 and Retro Studios already have confirmed titles with Mario Kart 9 and Metroid Prime 4\n \n- EPD8 (3D Mario) hasn\u2019t released anything since Bowser\u2019s Fury and no full game since Mario Odyssey, with the 40th anniversary of the series this year it would totally make sense to have a new game\n \n- EPD5 (Animal Crossing / Splatoon) typically release a game every three years so a new one in 2025 lines up. Unlikely to be Splatoon 4 due to the final Splatfest being a major factor in the next game\u2019s development, so Animal Crossing is probably next. Or maybe a new IP? Every Nintendo console has that one new IP at / near launch\n \n- Next Level Games\u2019 (Luigi\u2019s Mansion / Mario Strikers) release schedule would have a game this year. Could be another sequel to those two games but with both Mario Kart 9 AND most likely a 3D Mario this year there could be too much Mario, enough to push NLG\u2019s game into 2026. Or maybe they do something else? Revive another IP like they did for Punch Out?\n \n- Camelot Software (Mario Sports / Golden Sun) has had the longest gap in releases in the studio\u2019s history. Same with Next Level Games there\u2019s a possibility they push their next game to 2026 if it\u2019s a Mario game to prevent oversaturation, but apparently Nintendo does have some interest in the Golden Sun IP, and it would explain the long gap in releases\u2026\n \n- Intelligent Systems (Fire Emblem, Paper Mario, WarioWare) has had one game every year during the Switch era (minus 2022, but 2023 had two games to make up for it), most likely this year is Fire Emblem which would coincidentally complete the 3DS Fire Emblem path of \u201cthe fanbase\u2019s new favourite game\u201d, \u201cthe one that was considered Too Anime Trope-y\u201d, and \u201cthe remake that released after the next console was released\u201d if the next game is indeed a remake as many rumours have said\n \n- While not a brand new game, it would make sense for there to be some sort of an update to NSO to coincide with the new console, whether it\u2019s a third tier or additions to the existing Expansion Pack it\u2019ll absolutely include new consoles with emulators developed by NERD as the first party N64 and GBA libraries are drying up fast (GameCube, DS, perhaps even Wii if they want enough games to drip feed through an entire console generation? Probably just wishful thinking)\n \n- Masahiro Sakurai\u2019s next game started development in April of 2022, next month will mark 3 years of development which is how long Smash Ultimate took from start to release. I could totally see a reality where we have Mario Kart for the Summer / launch, 3D Mario for the Fall and Smash 6 for the Winter / holiday season. Assuming it\u2019s Smash at all, but it wouldn\u2019t make sense to not follow-up the third highest selling game on the last console",

They're exactly the team you'd look to for a mouse-con showcase game\n\n\nHAL Laboratory is also probably due for something soon, even if it's just that rumored Planet Robobot remaster for the current Switch\n\n\ne: Also with the patent that attaches multiple Splatoon directors (Amano and Sakaguchi) to that NSO playtest game, there's a possibility it's EPD 5's next title (and it could also fill the \"new IP at/near launch\" niche)",

Sakaguchi has been with EPD4 for a bit as are the two programmers on the patent. From what I can tell, the playtest game fits a lot with Kawamoto's production style. It could also theoretically be a new EPD group since EPD1 has been vacated for a while (staff all moved to EPD2 which is now called the Co-Production Group)",

I do think there is a chance that if we don't see Monolithsoft's new game at the direct, then I think we will for sure see it before the year is over at either the summer or fall direct. the co-director of the Xenoblade series Koh Kojima hinted he was already working on a new game on the eve of Xenoblade 3's release and had no involvement with Future Redeem and likely had no involvement with X definition edition, so I think Monolithsoft is almost in the due for a reveal camp.",

I don't see it being a new Xenoblade outright, I still think we're in the break period until around 2027, 2028 or smth, but a new IP still makes a bit too much sense to me. It's also been around 3 years since Xenoblade 3 (and about 4 since Xenoblade 3 finished production since they likely finished in late 2021) and Monolith Soft frequently works on titles in-tandem (see Xenoblade X in 2015 and Xenoblade 2 in 2017). \n\nGiven the timeframe of the Switch 2 Presentation will have games between 2 and 12 months out (comparable to how Xenoblade 2 was revealed and released in december of 2017) it doesn't have to be this year, just soon.",

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, alongside Mario Kart which is a lock for launch, a Smash, AC and Splatoon dropped all within the first two years at least.",

I unfortunately think that Switch 2 will only see a dump of games they\u2019ve already released elsewhere, like FF7R, Visions of Mana, maybe KH3, and FFXVI if Switch 2 can handle it or they can otherwise boil it down enough to port it. It could be just me but I think they\u2019re just silent because they release so many things in close succession and don\u2019t pace at all, so they have a dry spot.",

There's no way they're spending time making system sellers like the new mario kart or 3d mario crossgen but surely they're not sitting on like a good amount of switch 1 games. \n\nMaybe the rumored robobot port is gonna be like the epic yarn 3ds port where it's the official final game on the system?",

            "body": "All I have to say is that without any significant leaks, it at least means that the entire bucket is full to pour over our heads in ~2 weeks. \n\nIt\u2019s funny for me because I was a Nintendo-centric, almost handheld-only gamer for most of modern gaming history (played more GBA than PS2 and GC, more DS than Wii, and waaaaay more 3DS than Wii U, supplemented with PSP and briefly with a Vita, and mostly only ever played newer PS or XB systems at friends\u2019 houses), and the Switch kinda snapped me into modern-ish AAA for the first time since GC/PS2 era. As a result, after a very brief stint with a PS4 that I sold because I never played it often, I got a gaming laptop and later a Steam Deck, with a hearty amount of industry defining games from the prior decade to gnaw on. \n\nBut I still just feel my spirit and enthusiasm for the medium start to wane and deflate when there\u2019s a drought of Nintendo news or big new releases to look forward to. This has been the most protracted end of a system\u2019s life and transition to new hardware I have ever experienced in my life. I made a pact with myself months ago to pack it in with Switch and save the few games I haven\u2019t finished yet for Switch 2, so I\u2019ll have a buildup of experiences coming to supplement whatever launches with it, and mostly moved over to Steam exclusively for the time being. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting that I\u2019ve gotten quite a few games late last year and in the past few months that I love- FFVII Rebirth and MH Wilds chief among them despite the fact that I can hardly run either adequately on my hardware- but there\u2019s just this feeling of boredom and exasperation at solely playing long winded, large production games without at least interlacing the often more breezy and easy-in/easy-out Nintendo offerings into the mix. There\u2019s also just this doldrums-esque mundanity I personally feel when there\u2019s no immediately known Nintendo works on the horizon, like some portion of my psyche that patiently looks forward to certain forms of joy can\u2019t properly exercise itself. \n\nAnyway, I feel like it\u2019s safe to say that this is buttoned extremely tightly shut, and it\u2019s most likely that we won\u2019t have any major Nintendo leaks in the next two weeks- only rumors. But that\u2019s fine- I can do two weeks standing on my head eating only dry whole wheat toast. I have my money set aside for presumably the hardware itself and 2 or 3 games, and I\u2019m about as stoked as can be- unless there\u2019s like 4 or more must-haves on the launch list, in which case I gotta start selling things.",

Despite multiple rumors, they didn\u2019t drop a direct since Summer. Even stranger is how Nintendo seemed to move things around (such as compiling all their events in August) just for nothing to end up happening in September or for the remainder of the year for that matter. Nintendo has been super quiet, even with the Switch 2 reveal trailer just being very simplistic. Not to mention as well how Nintendo seems to love shadow dropping a lot now, with the Origami King trailer, Xenoblade Chronicles X trailer, Switch 2 reveal trailer, and the Super Mario 35th Anniversary. \n\n\n\nAnyhoo, main point I\u2019m trying to get across is that it feels like video game companies try to conduct as minimal video game advertising as much as possible.",

Plus Prime 4 looks like to be just more Metroid Prime, which the Metroid formula isn't exactly mainstream appeal.\n\n-Its a crossgen game with a 150 million install base. Nintendo was able to get away with making TP and BOTW crossgen games as the flagship launch title, because the last gen versions were on such a small install base that they could get away with it. \n\n-Mario Kart has already been teased ans shown to be running on the Switch 2.
