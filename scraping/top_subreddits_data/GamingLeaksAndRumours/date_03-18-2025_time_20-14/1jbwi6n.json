If said game doesn\u2019t do well then it gives them a reason to stop support for that Nintendo console.

Hopefully, the state the industry is in and the strength of the switch brand means those days are over. However, I will choose to be skeptical until I see otherwise.

Most of the people that bought it did so to recreate an experience they had in their younger days, and the game does a good enough job in that department. That was 6 months ago. Those same people have played the single player content, probably spent some time in MP, and then moved on. They now have access forever so they can play the game whenever they get the itch, or whenever the homies are around, but they\u2019re not playing it every day because life is different now. They will check in for content updates, and occasionally play with friends, but they won\u2019t be talking about and playing the game actively enough for it to really be noticed online. So what you do see online is going to come from a small but passionate group of the community who value this game way more than average. Their opinions will be nitpicky by nature, but I guess that\u2019s what Reddit is for. Just enjoy the game yourself",
