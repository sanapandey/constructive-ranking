    "selftext": "[Source](https://thegamepost.com/devs-scrapped-plans-marvel-gaming-universe-mcu/)\n\n\u201cWhen I first started working on Marvel games, there was this idea that they were going to create like a Marvel gaming universe that was going to exist in the same way that the MCU,\u201d Irvine said.\n\nAccording to Seropian, who worked at Disney as SVP & GM of Core Games from 2009 to 2012, he was part of early efforts to make this idea happen. But there were major hurdles. \u201cWhen I was at Disney, that was my initiative, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s tie these games together.\u2019 It was pre-MCU,\u201d Seropian explained. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t get funded.\u201d\n\n\"Even back then, we were trying to figure out, 'If there's going to be this MGU, how is it different from the comics? How is it different from the movies? How are we going to decide if it stays consistent?' And I think some of those questions got complex enough that there were people at Disney who didn\u2019t really want to deal with them,\" said Irvine.",

            "body": "Makes sense. I think a MGU could work for games made by the same developer (i.e Insomniac Marvel Universe). But publishing level across multiple developers it's just too much of a hassle logistically to handle. Especially since games take so long to make and pivots happen mid-way through development. And it'd be incredibly difficult to keep everyone alligned and have the same continuity across developers.",

Standalone continuities like what Insomniac will be doing with Spider-Man and X-Men or what EA's potentially doing with their multi-game deal are probably the best solution we have\n\nStill crossing my fingers for Insomniac doing Daredevil.
