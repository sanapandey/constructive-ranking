Also I don't know what reviews you're talking about, but the vast majority of the reviews I saw were positive. I think you need to find a better review system than IMDB's broken system. I mean it doesn't even require you to have seen the show or movie before you vote on the score.",

AC Shadows is probably going to be a perfectly fine game. It'll look, feel, and play like an Assassin's Creed. And what \"political message\" ghosts are you flailing at that you think She-Hulk had?

I just hope they will find a better use of the spoken Infinite system (or Animus Hub). To bring more content into the game over upcoming months.

Because less competitiveness will be a huge loss for the whole market.   \nAnd I really want to see more games like The Division, Ghost Recon (even tho I didn't like Wildlands), AC, Far Cry, The Crew, Splinter Cell and please- another Watch Dogs! \n\nAlso - hope we will see as soon as possible at least first teaser or info about the next AC Hexe, which gets me really excited!",

His quiet yet always angry nature is also conveyed through his combat, being some of the most brutal in the series (only behind alexios). He\u2019s full of so much anger and hatred because his life was stolen from him at such a young age and all he has to guide him is the brotherhood, so while hunting Lee down he latches onto it desperately, not fully grasping either side but knowing that the man who wronged him and father who abandoned him choose one side, so he must choose the other. Idk if any of this was actually accounted for during the writing for 3, but it made for one of the most compelling protagonists in the entire series imo once you dig below the surface, kinda the inverse of ezio. As you said, ezio is charming on the surface but doesn\u2019t have much beyond that, while Connor is one note on the surface but below that he\u2019s a soldier drafted into a war he knows almost nothing about, his anger and sadness taken advantage of by Achilles, who points him in a direction and says \u201ckill\u201d",

I felt like the progression system was lackluster and not engaging in the long term - it seemed built for linear run rather than a free exploration. The lack of interesting landmarks also did not help. I agree the stealth was tighter than most AC though.\n\n  \nIt is a good game, but the smaller scope/studio shows IMO",

I can't see it making more than Valhalla though.\n\nValhalla now is pretty divisive but before launch it had a lot of hype. There was a lot of interest in Viking themed stuff at the time, there was lofty promises about making stealth good again and cutting the bloat (both of which turned out to be complete nonsense). It also released in Covid so got a big boost from that.\n\nI don't think Shadows character controversy will affect it much. While online it might seem like it's this big huge deal. Outside of the world of terminally online eternally rage baited people most people really don't care or aren't even aware it's controversial. There was a similar controversy around AC3 and IIRC that game is still the best selling in the franchise by actual sales numbers. Gamers who discuss games a lot online don't represent the average gamer as much as they think they do.\n\nI think the biggest impacts on Shadows will be:\n\n1. Ubi's overly simular formulaic games have caught up with them. This is actually a good example of the difference between online gamer discourse vs average gamer. Online discourse has been complaining about the Ubi formula for over a decade at this point. The average gamer didn't seem to get bored of it till after AC Valhalla.\n\n2. Ghost of Tsushima. People were asking for a Japan themed AC for decades and GoT basically beat them to it. Which will dampen sales a bit I think.",

Remember, the peak of the 360/PS3/Wii era was roughly 2008 to 2011 and that was all pure Great Recession economic conditions.

I was also literally a child (and definitely had too much access to the internet). \n\nIn retrospect, 8.8 is like as bang on the money as you can get for TP, and I say that as someone who really detests any scoring system that granular. TP is a fantastic example of a game where everything seems to have been done flawlessly in isolation, but it never quite comes together. Also the intro is too fucking long.\n\nIf it were my way, if reviews *must* have scores, they should all be out of 5. It would make people far more comfortable with middle of the road scores for decent but unremarkable games and bad scores for actually bad games. Right now we functionally already have that kind of system, with everything below a 6/10 bring considered unplayable garbage, and then 6/10 to 10/10 being the remaining points from \"not very good\" up to \"excellent.\" I think people are subjectively much more comfortable with 3 out of 5 stars for a decent but unremarkable game like AC Valhalla than they are with a 6/10 even if they're mathematically equal.",

But the story, the setting, the characters, that still changes. Isn't that enough to make each entry interesting at least?\n\nLike, if you have something that works, why not keep doing it? As an example, I'll mention my favourite franchise, Half-Life. There's actually very minimal changes in terms of gameplay between the games, and yet they're fantastic, and I wouldn't mind it if HL3 released tomorrow and played exactly like Episode Two, only taking me to new locations.\n\nHeck, back when I was a kid, I always dreamed of a Sonic game that was just more of Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and that's what Sonic Mania was, sort of. I don't need every game to change up the formula, as long as they keep adding new locations to explore, new characters and such.",

TotK is only the second game in the series' new open world formula - and it still heavily commits to its new central mechanics, especially Ultrahand.

No innovation, same formula, they don't change it. If you've played a few, you've played them all.\n\nBut that's not relevant to the discussion, we're talking about why people online don't like these games, not if they sell or not.

And I'm not talking variety between 2 different entries, but within the game itself.

I expect that argument to be made by a 12-year old at a Middle School lunch table when debating games with his/her friends as someone that young lacks to nuance of argument and situational awareness. Odyssey, Origins and Valhalla all sold well over 10 million. In addition, Origins sits at an 85% all time user rating on Steam and Odyssey at 89%. So this notiom that \"nobody likes these games\" lacks any factual context and just some statement you pulled out of your you know where.....\n\n>The target audience seems to be more casual/new gamers.\n\nIn theory the target audience for MOST games are \"casuals\" as they are the one that runs this industry in terms of consumers. Even Elden Ring was aimed at new/casual players as it, unlike other Souls games took the trendy open world approach and offered ingame ways to make comabt easier that previous Souls games didnt have. Its the reason it also went on to sell as well as it did....because of casuals and new players.\n\n>That one is easy, variety, a good combat system and a fun challenge.

The combat loop from Demon Souls is the exact same in Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Elden Ring. They all involve around the dodge/roll combat mechanic. Hell, they all even share the same exact UI in terms of health/magic/stamina all the eay down to the exact same colors. Again, nearly all games share/keep the same/similar gameplay and combat mechanics with only some minor changes here and there. No developer is going to completely throw out a concept from a previous iteration and reinvent the wheel for a sequel. If that were the case then every single game would be a full 100% innovation from the previous game. This goes all the way back to the original Mario Bros games as they all share the same foundation but just with some new iterative additions over time.\n\nShadows is no different, keeping the foundation of the RPG AC games while adding new things.",

But perhaps that would be resolved if the proposed merger or buyout goes through.\n\nRegardless, Assassins Creed has been a reliable cash cow for quite some time now, and considering this game carries the same general gameplay elements and tone of the recent best-selling Antiquity trilogy, I don\u2019t doubt this game will do well.",

Pretty sure Mirage had the same, and so I'm confident Shadows will too.\n\n\nReally, Origins feels the least stealth focused of the five. It amounted to stabbing people in the back (assuming your kit is good enough to kill them) and hiding their body in a bush, which is about as barebones as it gets.",

So being offended about stupid shit is fine! cause I'm a gamer, I'm so important and I get offended because my life sucks and I work at an Arbys\"\n\nDon't overcomplicate things, you felt offended about Yasuke, don't play the game, you like to create drama on X or whatever bullshit social media of your choice, go ahead! enough with making drama for clouth,.enough with the same rubber banding crap about ONE GAME,.enough!\n\nUbisoft is diving his company to the shit, I think they got the memo about what you think.",
