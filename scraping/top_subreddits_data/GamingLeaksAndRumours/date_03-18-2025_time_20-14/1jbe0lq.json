Probably after the heavily suspected Windwaker / Twilight princess releases, they'd get there much later.\n\nBut then it would fill up with stuff like Resident Evil 0/1, Ty the tasmanian, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's Nickelodeon type of games as well.\n\nMy biggest hope is for games that have tricky licenses to end up on it. Eternal Darkness and Twin Snakes are historically messy, but maybe it's easier to find a legal / financial agreement if it's not sold, but timed releases on subscription services, we can have it if even for a few years.",

It's the first system they have that has games that wouldn't need full remakes to pad out their library. Games like Double Dash, Melee, the Pokemon spinoffs, Animal Crossing, the Mario Parties, WarioWare, etc. would all suit GameCube NSO for one reason or another - they're the kinds of things Nintendo doesn't ever revisit. But games like F-Zero GX, Metroid Prime 2, Wind Waker/Twilight Princess - even stuff like the Star Fox games, Kirby Air Ride (more because of HAL than anything), and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance are things they could skip over to remaster. If they want to gauge interest in series like Custom Robo, Chibi-Robo, Eternal Darkness, 1080, or even things as niche as Battalion Wars, NSO drops aren't going to be able to do it, either. I'm not at all against GameCube NSO (aside from the fact that I don't keep up with the NSO library well at all but would be more likely to actually play standalone rereleases, but that's a me problem), but unlike every other platform on NSO, its games wouldn't need full remakes to be modernized. Pikmin 1 and 2 getting standalone Switch releases is particularly curious, even though it's likely because of the pointer controls - and that's because I believe they're running on an emulator from NERD, who's been handling the NSO emulators for the most part. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if they essentially do GameCube Virtual Console under a different name and continue to charge for rereleases from that era.",
