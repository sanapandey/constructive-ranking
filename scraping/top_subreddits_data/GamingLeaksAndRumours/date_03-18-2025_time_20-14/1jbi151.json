It was even a core part of the story of Jedi Survivor, which is one of the bestselling Star Wars games ever made\n\n\nOn the other hand, Tales of the Jedi ended after just 35 issues (no novels were made) and then the Old Republic era went on a  5-year hiatus with no content in ANY format. It never really had a chance to be seen in the way that the High Republic was",

The worst era to set it in imo would be the OT era (which is sadly probably what they're going to do), because it's just so overdone recently, with most of the recent shows (except Acolyte) and games being set in that era. \n\nWe don't have a High Republic era game yet, so that would actually be really fun to see. Ideally it would have High Republic, Clone Wars, Galactic Civil War and the sequel era, but i think that's unlikely.",
