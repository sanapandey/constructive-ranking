I think all of them are better than solo leveling. ORV is a pretty good system story and is popular for a reason. Myst is a more unique take on the murim story, infinite mage is a bit of a generic mage story but has likable characters and systems, mookhyang has a great story but honestly gets very convoluted with a bunch of countries and people but if you can keep it straight it's pretty good.",

Redice studio who did the manhwa is goated taking a dog tier story no one cared about and turned it into a phenomenon with some really really good looking panels. \n\nThere will never be any tension or interesting characters. The background drawings of the named shadows gave them infinitely more character than any single character in the written version.\n\nThe novel was so bad I dropped it near the climax, like one volume off. Just stopped checking the updates and had 0 interest to see where it ended up. \n\nThe worst bit of all is it's a fucking gate novel with a system. 2016 when it first started coming out, fine I guess (systems were already super overplayed and still are a blight on the scene) but I was quickly super over it. I remember like 2 other gates at the time and the market instantly became more saturated than the vrmmo era (thanks SAO and LMS).

Genuinely show any of these people a good tv show, book or movie and they'll loose their mind. The quality of writing in most anime (especially the dialogue. holy shit the dialogue) is so godawful in comparison to basically anything, games included. And surprise surprise, the games that are most inspired by anime also suffer from this.\n\nIt's so funny to see anime fans fight each other about which anime is better. Waging the battle of mediocrity.",
