I bet a lot of people would go to escape life on Earth, but yeah\u2026it will be some time before Mars would be very fun.",

Because of its thin atmosphere, Mars should prove to be much warmer for people than it is for thermometers. Those of us who live where the winter is colder than the winter in south England regularly experience weather that feels colder than the midlatitudes of Mars during the afternoon of an average summer sol. This includes much of Asia, North America, and northern Europe. Some sparsely populated frontier areas of Earth feel at least as cold as much of Mars does, year round.\n\nRegardless of how one regards the thermal comfort of winter in England, or of summer in Resolute, they suggest a much improved prospect for summer on Mars than the one rendered up to now by raw temperature readings transmitted from its surface. The image of winter on Mars has also been enhanced, for it is not as fiercely cold as spacecraft weather reports have made it seem, but might actually seem warmer than the winter in some frontier areas of our home planet.\n\nThere may very well be good reasons why Mars is not suited for humans, but extremely cold air is not one of them. Mars simply does not have enough of it to be an insurmountable problem. Scratch one dragon.\"",

It probably boils down to the same reason why wedding photographers take hundreds of photos and the albums only have a few dozen or so: In photography the best way to assure one good photo is to take 20 and weed out the bad ones. This was probably a lot of photos stitched together and the burry portions are angles that the camera arm couldn\u2019t cover.",

If you go to the NASA rover websites, you\u2019ll see most of them are squares placed over the top of each other forming a mosaic. The rover is blurred because it\u2019s difficult to take pics of itself that aren\u2019t skewed. The shots you see are distance shots.  The cams on the rovers are pretty amazing.  There are teams of people on earth that take these images and piece them into the mosaics you see here.",

So if we work towards \"bootstrapping\" such a circular economy on the moon or mars then we could do the same here on earth.\n\nAn advantage for mining on the moon is that you have no atmosphere so you could build a giant railgun and ship materials or manufactured goods to earth or anywhere in the solar system.\n\nOf course there isn't really a need to do this, but it's cool so we could maybe \"trick\" ourselves to become a better civilization.",

To clarify, the air pressure is roughly equivalent to earth's atmo at 80,000ft (i.e., barely there), and about as cold (generally more than 100 below Fahrenheit).\n\nAll this gab about humans going to Mars is pure hogwash.  Not saying it will never happen, but certain lunatic billionaires throw the phrase around like we could just go now if we committed to spending the trillions it would cost.  This is bullshit.  It will take, at a minimum, decades to even gather data on long-term trip like this.  At this point the USA can't even commit to a stable system of government for more than 4 years.

They've been feeding this shit for generations and you guys are eating it up like it's fucking cake. We've never been to space because everything that we've been taught in school was only there because the higher elites want us to know that information. Propaganda is crucial to control. The more deceived the masses are, the more easy it is to manipulate them. Your being fed deception and you don't even question it. Why? Just because a fucking news head line says so? What kind of logic is that. IGNORANCE. It's not stupidity, being stupid is harder to fix so you wouldn't really want that. But ignorance is evil, knowledge is good. Why do you think they keep it from you? Because they don't want you to know. Your what's known as the proletariat my friends. Were all PROLETARIATS, The proles, the poor most would say. And the Bourgeoisie, the rich, the elite are the people doing this. Like you go about your day to day life and you see shit that you don't even question. Not JUST because you don't know what it is, but because they've been programming you since you were fucking born. Entertainment. Movies, games, drugs, sex, fashion, food, and the goddamn school system. They control your belief system therefore they control what you do. Everything around you is influence. Straight up. Let's take evolution for example. They take a topic like evolution and shove that FAR deep into your poor little easy to control and manipulate fucking mind and they call it a FACT, reality, true. Why is it true? Oh, well the sciencetist that made that textbook said so. See how stupid that sounds? That religion can be only true if the earth was billions of years old. And we as a species wouldn't be like how we are today. We have emotions, we're not animals, we are a single species that are alone, no one else like us. Man what the fuck does that tell you? God. Thats what it tells me. God.",
