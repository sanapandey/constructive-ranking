When roller coaster goes down a steep descent, you feel a free fall, which makes you feel like you are going to fall forward.\n\nIn a simulator, the chair suddenly tilts back, so your brain is tricked into feeling that you are going to fall backwards and makes you push yourself forward to maintain an upright position to avoid a fall backward which along with the visuals make you feel like a free fall.\n\nThe vice versa also happens similarly.",

I'm probably wrong though.  I went to Disney with my wife a decade ago, after having bees there as a kid and then teenager, and was immediately thrown off by the opposite directions the simulator was turning in the star wars ride.",
