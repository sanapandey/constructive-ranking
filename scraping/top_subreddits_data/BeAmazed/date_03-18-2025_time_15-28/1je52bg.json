They are very sensetive when they're new and fuzzy velvet, but as soon as they stop growing aka the bone dies - sensation goes down.  \nThey still do have nerves but since the antlers are dead, it doesn't supply the nerves with the stuff it needs to function properly, and therefore the sensation is basically nill.\n\nAnd no, they don't feel any pain when the matured antlers fall off. They don't break, they just fall off.  \nIirc, the antlers are basically controlled cancer growths.",
