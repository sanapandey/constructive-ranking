Jump off some mountain and see how far you could go.  People were jumping off some mountain in the alps and landing 10 km from where they started.  \n\nThen some dude released a video gliding 10M off the ground and everything changed.  The new yardstick was how close could you get to the ground, and flying between / over / around obstacles.  \n\nBut what also changed was the danger.  If your chute doesn't open up at 2,000 feet you some have time to cut away to a backup.  However, if you hit a rock formation at 200 kph you're pink mist.",
