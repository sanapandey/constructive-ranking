A short while later, I hear loud screams, looked up and saw the DEA agent running for his life being chased by my angry rodeo bull. With each step, the bull was gaining ground and he seemed sure to be gored before he reached safety. The officer looked terrified and continued to run for his life.\n\nI threw down my tools, immediately ran to the edge of the fence and shouted at the top of my lungs,\n\n\u201cYour badge, show him your fucking badge!\u201d",
