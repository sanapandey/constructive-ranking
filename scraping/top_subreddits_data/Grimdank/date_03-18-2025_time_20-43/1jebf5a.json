It was enjoyable enough, but I kind of felt like Shadowsun herself almost came across as inexperienced and floundering a lot of the times considering her age and reputation. I also tend not to care much for Nurgle-related stories, so that didn't really help that much.\n\nI'm listening to the Elemental Council novel atm and am about 3 or so hours into it and it's been very engrossing so far. I actually like all of the main cast so far and they all seem competent in ways that goes against the grain for what their castes expect from them, like the water caste character being a jaded old spy who sometimes forget to be deferential to the Ethereals before remembering exactly who he's talking to, a fire caste warrior who knows she's the latest in a line of clones from a hero that she's trying to live up to the expectations people have of her predecessors' reputation without falling to the same follies that doomed them, a young earth caste engineer who basically built her own crisis suit to help with being able to better technically support the fire caste on the front lines, a veteran air caste pilot who sacrificed his fighter to destroy an enemy about to overrun a friendly position, and the ethereal who seems to think a lot of traditions are relics from an era before realizing how dangerous the galaxy is and he is collecting these specialists to help him even if they are being censured by their castes. It's very amusing that he's insisting the other characters speak to him as an equal and they're like shitting bricks because it's basically like having a demi-god you've been conditioned to see as infallible and all knowing and capable of destroying you on a whim if they think you failed them suddenly ask you for advice and call them by their first names.\n\nIt's been good so far!",
