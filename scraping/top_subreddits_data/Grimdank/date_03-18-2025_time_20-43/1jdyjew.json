And it took a lot to take her down, as in a squad of terminators, the first captain of Iron Fists and multiple other assassins, including several grand masters of the assassin temples had issues and a lot of them died before killing her.

Officio Assassinorum made a stable Human Tyranid DNA hybrid that was immune to the Hive Mind control or other Tyranid patterns of behavior. What it was though was not sane in any imaginable capacity whatsoever. It was an absolute monster. It had the powers, training, gear and mental conditioning of all 4 common Assassin temples plus Tyranid powers. Basically its power level was that of a super Predator/Alien Hybrid from the Alien movie-verse. Literally. She could endlessly mutate to become an even more perfect creature by taking in specific DNA from bio mass and lay eggs to make herself clones, henchmen or even revive herself in case of death. What went wrong was that she/it had a massive god complex and decided to destroy everything and remake the Galaxy starting with the Imperium. Think Carrigan from StarCraft but not hot. Such was the threat she presented, that the Officio Assassinorum willingly made pacts with daemons and Chaos Space Marines from the World Eaters to attack her. Khorn does not care from whence the blood flows unless the Legienstrasse is the one spilling it.",
