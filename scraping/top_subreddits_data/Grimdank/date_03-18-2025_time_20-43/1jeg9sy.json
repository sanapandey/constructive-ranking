This is possible because they have reliable short range (relatively speaking) FTL travel and weapons optimized for long range combat.\n\n\nThe problem is that Imperial ships are designed for short range (relatively speaking) slugging matches and they can jump a long way, with varying degrees of reliability/accuracy.\n\n\nSo sometimes an Imperial ship will warp in at the edge of a system and the Tau get days or even weeks to plink at it, giving the Tau the advantage. Other times an Imperial ship will warp in practically on top of them and it's like a pitbull named Princess let loose in a daycare.\n\n\nGenerally the Imperium loses fewer ships because if the positioning is bad they can simply warp away, damaged, but alive. Whereas when the positioning is bad for the Tau they're either caught with their pants down or forced to try and defend a planet or something, which works against their strengths.\n\n\nThis is partly why the Tau NEED to expand the borders of their empire, in space they defend by attacking, they need their mobility to fight effectively.",
