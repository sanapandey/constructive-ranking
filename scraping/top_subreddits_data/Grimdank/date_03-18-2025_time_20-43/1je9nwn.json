These tribes were different types of Tau with very different cultures and bodies. They ended up fighting a war that lasted centuries, and due to famine, disease, and killing the Tau were at risk of extinction.\n\nThe Ethereal\u2019s then emerged and convinced the tribes to set aside their differences and work together for the shared benefit of everyone. They called this philosophy \u201cT\u2019au\u2019va\u201d, meaning the Greater Good.\u00a0\n\nTau society was reshaped around living this philosophy. The tribes became castes, with the very different peoples of the tribes being given the roles that best fit their unique attributes. The Hunter of the Plains tribe became the warriors of the Fire caste. The merchants of the River tribe become the diplomates of the Water caste. Each caste became a specialized piece of the larger whole, relying on each I\u2019m a way that meant no caste could go it alone.\n\nOnce the Tau journeyed to the stars and met other species, those who would accept their way of life were adopted into their society. However, not being Tau, they weren\u2019t limited to specific kinds of tasks, and could contribute however they were best able. Other groups become trading partners, or allies.\u00a0\n\nSome cultures in Tau space are fully integrated into Tau society. Others are more separate. The Tau are flexible in how they deal with others, and will work to come to the arraignment that creates the best outcomes.",

They organize and conduct themselves how they see fit, but are subject to any restrictions the empire places on them. Much like how kroot or human auxiliaries exist in the fire caste, the other castes (minus the ethereals) would logically have something similar. Like farmers or miners for the earth caste, or clerks and assistants for the water caste.\n\nDepending on how you look at it though, you could read a level of soft discrimination as being inherent in the system. \n\nFor instance, each Sept is governed by an elemental council that has 5 seats for each tau caste and one seat for non t'au races. That's not a seat *per* race, that's one representative for *all* non-t'au within the Sept, regardless of how many there are and how many races that includes. It's framed as an \"outside perspective\" and a different representative might be chosen each time, but it's also at best a token gesture.",

Malekith before his fall more or less hated his mother. He is the one that personally rooted out her cults and dragged her to the capital in chains. He only really sided with her when she tricked him into believing her prophecies that the Phoenix King was going to betray him.\n\nOnce that happens, he fairly quickly does his Anakin/Arthas betrayal moment and ends up burnt to a crisp. And once he has his suit, he's incapable of taking it off or ever eating, drinking, or feeling a sense of touch again. That is to mean, he's not really capable of having sex. So more than likely, the incest would be emotional than it is necessarily physical. Or at least the physical had a very short window to have happened.",
