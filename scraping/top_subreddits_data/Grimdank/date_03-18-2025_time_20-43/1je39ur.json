You dare? Suffer not the witch to live, so says Cassor.\u2019 One heavy mechanical claw closed around the carnifex\u2019s throat, holding it in place. The beast, as if understanding what Cassor had planned, began to struggle, but to no avail. As surely as it had the Dreadnought pinned, Cassor had it held fast. Before the monster could release the burst of bile it had prepared, the Dreadnought brought up his wrist-mounted meltagun and shoved the barrel between the creature\u2019s jaws. With a dull hiss, the back of the beast\u2019s skull vanished in a cloud of superheated gas.\n\nThe best Dreadnought, period.",
