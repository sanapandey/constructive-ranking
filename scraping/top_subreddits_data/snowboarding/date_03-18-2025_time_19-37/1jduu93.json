That\u2019s what the actual jump is for.\n\nWhen you have a Kicker or something similar you have to hold the pressure and just slightly pop. It feels more like pushing down on the jump than actual jumping in the air.\n\nIf you bend your knees more you probably are not able to hold this pressure and loose a lot of upwards momentum. Hope this makes sense.\n\nWatch this. Best explanation out there:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-bCYIDG_2wg?si=Yu9x0EwsFL-3kmGo",
