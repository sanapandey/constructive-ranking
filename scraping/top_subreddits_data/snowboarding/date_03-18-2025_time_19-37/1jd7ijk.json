I had questions where some were answered by just thumbing around questions. \n\nI was a natural skier growing up little (black diamonds, nothing could stop me), but fifteen years, and switching to a snowboard was harder than I imagined. I still have some natural skill transfer but I had problems. No black diamonds, no switching, I'd fall over (mostly when going slower), and had the apparent beginners issue of the board pulling out from under me. But I wasn't the worst at it, I learned good control, controlled my speed, didn't go too hard, even hit some jumps (bunny hill stuff). \n\nI do have to wonder though, if I don't find the question elsewhere: is snow machine snow less forgiving or what? It was heavy and it was all chewed up when I came (late in the day), and when the temperature dropped it turned into ice. \n\nAlso, is it supposed to be this hard and unsafe to go in a straight line?\n\nAside from that, I'm the happiest I've ever been going back.",
