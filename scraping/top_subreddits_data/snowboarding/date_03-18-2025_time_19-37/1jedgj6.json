Was able to get back into it this season and am looking to progress further in the park. \n\nBeen getting lots of reps in this spring but I can\u2019t seem to figure out how to control my arms. Need some advice. I don\u2019t want to look like I\u2019m hitting the griddy when I slide off every rail. Any tips / feedback would be appreciated. ",

It's harder to keep your arms from flailing when doing bigger and more tech tricks. Keep doing reps. The more comfortable and controlled you are doing tricks the easier it will be to control your arms.",

On some of those rail shots- you are hunched way over, that of course, means that you\u2019re not balanced very well on your board. A nice stacked posture will greatly decrease your need to have your hands up high. With all this said- if you jump, usually arms go up with your body going up. So, a lot of it is just physics as well.",

It\u2019s honestly not bad but super small, they only have one good kicker and you have to bomb the entire run from the lift to even clear it. Personally I love the rail section it\u2019s good for progressing. Best part about it is you\u2019re pretty much dodging ski kids the whole time cuz the park run is also the bunny hill / main lift lol",
