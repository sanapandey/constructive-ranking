Also, despite his likeness not meeting with Mr. Barksdale's approval, he was apparently considered very handsome in his time.\n\nI believe your factual correctness should be weighed more heavily than your admittedly snarky attitude, and since the original comment is quite off-topic in any case, I myself judge that it justifies both your (and now my) digression. On balance, I'm upvoting you.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed this zigzagging journey as I have. If not in content, perhaps in form it resembles the skidding, winding, bouncing path we snowboarders take through moguls, particularly in variable snow.\n\nEdit: I caught an edge and ate it. Hamilton is on the $10, not the $20. \ud83e\udd26",
