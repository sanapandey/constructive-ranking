    "selftext": "After a few intense weeks of designing and building an elegant yet structurally sound snowboard boat, she was ready for the high seas! Or at least a pond skim.\n\nI went down to Snowshoe Mountain to set sail! Unfortunately corporate risk management told me a few minutes before I was supposed to go that the boat was \"too well made\" and they wouldn't allow me to participate in the pond skim even from a greatly reduced drop in.\n\nIt was definitely a cannonball to the old stomach and took the wind out of my sails. Next year I'll have to go to a resort that can appreciate a beautiful, sea worthy craft.",
