You tweak your cover letter to sound \u201cpassionate\u201d about a job you\u2019ll probably never hear back from. And don\u2019t even get me started on the interviews\u2014three rounds, an unpaid project, a panel with five people, and then\u2026 radio silence.\n\nThen there\u2019s the classic:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll circle back in a few weeks.\u201d (Never hear from them again.)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re overqualified.\u201d (I still need a job though??)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to move forward with another candidate.\u201d (Job is reposted the next day.)\n\n\nHow did we get to the point where applying for jobs is basically unpaid labor? And why does networking feel like begging people to acknowledge your existence?\n",

Spending countless hours crafting a cover letter and resume specific to each job only to be instantly rejected or to hearing nothing from their robotic ATS systems. \n\nSearching for a job is a frustrating experience. But we all have bills to pay, so keep taking a new step forward each day.",
