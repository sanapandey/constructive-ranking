I had one with a manager who asked some questions in relation to marketing well and how we\u2019d market in the LA area and he spoke if in and outs of the company, then I met with a pretty higher level manager who talked about those details more throughly and asked me some questions, and then she called me the day she offered me the job with a few more questions because she said she and her co admins were having a hard time picking someone. Not sure who I was competing with for it to have been that hard because 1. She told me a few hours later before offering me the job that they were tired of trying to make a deicison so they were going with me but also because marketing in advertising is not rocket science, it\u2019s really just common sense based. I didn\u2019t take the offer because when I went to see her at her office for a final meeting she said some off putting stuff that related to how she values employees",
