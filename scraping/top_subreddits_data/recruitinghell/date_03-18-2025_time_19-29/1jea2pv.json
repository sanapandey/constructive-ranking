    "selftext": "Spent 6 months applying to what I deemed were \u201crealistic\u201d positions in my field. 500+ applications, dozens of interviews, got nowhere. About two months ago I decided to apply for my \u201cdream\u201d position on a whim\u2026 figured the worst they could do was say no! But they didn\u2019t. They said yes! I did it! I landed a job I thought was so far out of reach that it took me six months to work up the courage to even apply. I beat out 600 other applicants, most of whom were already local to the area (I had to relocate from 10 hrs away). It\u2019s a dream. It\u2019s so much better than anything else I was willing to settle for. I can\u2019t believe this is real life. I started yesterday and it was the most amazing first day I\u2019ve ever had at a job. I just wanted to share because I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d land anything, let alone my DREAM position. Thanks for listening!",
