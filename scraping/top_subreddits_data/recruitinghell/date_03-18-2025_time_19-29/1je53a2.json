At the same time, I hope I can for the last three months. The way I looked at unemployed people today for a while, the unemployed people for months ago, is entirely different. Wishing you all the best in your battles as well.",

I hate the waiting game, especially after three months. if anything, this has taught me to believe that I did not get the job and immediately starrt applying again.",
