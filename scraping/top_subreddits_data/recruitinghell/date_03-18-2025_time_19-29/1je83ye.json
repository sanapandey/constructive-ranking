We sent in +100k applications, analyzed +56,000 of them interviewed 112 recruiters and audited 32 ATS. The portion of the study that relates to your post is this:\n\nOn average, 64% of all resumes sent for a job application remain unopened and automatically get rejected + the average amount of time recruiters spend on a resume is 7 seconds. That's because every job (especially if it's remote and pays +$100k) gets 600+ resumes per day for any given position - So multiply that by the # of days a job is open, add to that the fact that the same recruiter sourcing for that job has 15 other jobs to source for, 20 followups a week 12 screenings, 6 trackers to keep up to date and is paid $30/h to take shit from a hiring manager who expects him/her to find Steve Job's love child...you get your answer.\n\nThe only proven way we found to improve the rejection rate is to apply early (within 6h of a job being posted) with a tailored resume, and apply to as many jobs as humanly possible or use AI for that.

Bye bye shitty old job and it's struggles, hello new job and new shitty struggles.\n\nSalary increase, and increased responsibilities. Several engineers will report to me. The manager said that he's never seen that and likes the type of personality that has the courage to do that. I had nothing to lose, and it turns out I beat all the online applicants-they didn't even get to interview.\n\nBut you do you, hooe it works out.",
