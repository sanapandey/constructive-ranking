    "selftext": "Had the strangest experience with a company during the application / interview process and thought this group would appreciate it\n\nSequence of events:\n- Friday 03/14, I was invited to complete a one-way video interview for the role (first interview). \n- I\u2019ve been pretty sick, and the deadline was Tuesday, so I rested up on the weekend and did it Monday afternoon, 03/17.\n- I finished the video recording at about 4:28pm, and checked my email at that time.\n- To my surprise, I had a rejection email time stamped for 4:10pm.\n\nScreenshots attached for funsies. I did email the recruiter asking for clarification on whether I was still being considered for the role, and no response yet. \n\nHonestly can\u2019t tell if this is just snafu on their part or if they were pissed I didn\u2019t complete the video interview within the first few days? One of the stranger experiences I\u2019ve had in this weird job hunt O_o Probably file this under a dodged bullet, lol",

I\u2019ve heard a lot of chatter about how you should throw specific words in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for each job posting, but then that\u2019s just beating the AI isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m still a little stubborn at this point lol I\u2019m not ready to do all that extra work to beat the system just yet",
