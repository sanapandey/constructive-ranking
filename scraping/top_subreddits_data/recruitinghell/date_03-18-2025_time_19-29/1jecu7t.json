    "selftext": "This is not a shit post about recruiters, but there is a big problem in the recruiting world that needs to be addressed.   \nI recently concluded a study with a team of nerds where, as part of the study, we interviewed 112 recruiters from all kinds of US companies to understand how they source for jobs, review resumes, and decide who to call/reject. What we found was shocking: \n\n1. Understaffing: 96% of the recruiters we surveyed worked +50 hours per week just to keep up, and their companies had no intentions of hiring help despite acknowledging the issue\n\n2. High workload: The average number of open reqs per recruiter was 23. That's 23 jobs open simultaneously, each receiving an average of 431 resumes per day. \n\n3. Low pay: on average, recruiters make $62k per year working 50h a week that's \\~$24/h\n\n4. Changing priorities and unreasonable expectations: 41% of the recruiters we surveyed believed hiring managers' expectations were unreasonable, with 27% qualifying hiring managers as delusional\n\n5.  No show: On average 25% of candidates will fail to show up for at least one interview and 35% of all candidates will drop off at some point during the interview process and that usually falls on the recruiter to keep them \"warm\"\n\nThese are just the top issues, and none of them are caused by recruiters but rather by the companies they work for. I am not saying all recruiters are angels but to blame it all on them in unfair. I used to shit on recruiters myself but having talked to a lot of them I genuinely think they are just the easiest target to blame. ",

Hiring managers always have unrealistic expectations of profiles but the pressure is more external I think right now - businesses are not in a position to take what they deem unnecessary risks that might be perceived to translate to loss, and this filters through to either highly risk-averse HMs or overly prescriptive briefs that can lead to protracted hiring. It is ultimately the job of recruiters to manage expectations and mitigate risk but a challenge when recruiting teams are simply used to fill seats rather than act as credible business partners.",

After applying to a fake LinkedIn job that was posted by Robert Half, I've gotten separate emails about jobs from no less than 12 different recruiters from them - often in quick succession. So there's definitely a lot of cannibalizing of leads going on there. \n\nBut I dealt with a pretty good one today - I'd met her before at some different things. She was a little... I hesitate to say pushy, but things are moving kind of quickly. That being said, I did try to leverage the fact I'm pretty far in with another job interview when the topic of pay came up. But she was pretty forthcoming with the pay while technically being employed under them and contracted out to the company I'd be physically working at, and the entire setup that that would entail. Tbh, it doesn't sound like a terrible program if they can deliver.",
