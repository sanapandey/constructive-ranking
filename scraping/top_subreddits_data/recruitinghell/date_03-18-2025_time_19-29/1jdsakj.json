    "selftext": "So this was just luck tbh, very very very lucky. \nI interviewed with a company went through 3 interviews, and the position went to someone else. I was legit bummed because I really liked the place and the people it seemed like a really really good fit and they were really open and honest with me and I was with them. They asked me how my job searches were going and I mentioned how the ghosting was the worst part etc. So a few days ago I got a call and they said they had an opening for another position they haven\u2019t been able to fill and it was in the exact same line of work I was doing when I was laid off, they said they were really impressed with me and they also thought I was a good fit as well. I go in the next day to have a chat with the person in charge of this other department and we all just hit it off, and later in the afternoon they sent me an offer. I counter offered and they countered again ever so slightly lower than my counter and I accepted this morning, all for a job I didn\u2019t even apply for! I\u2019m speechless and excited.\n\nI want all of you to know I\u2019m rooting for you, I have no magical steps or guidance but just don\u2019t give up. I know it\u2019s tough out there, just keep your head up, you got this!\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone, it means a lot! I\u2019ll still be here to root for you all!",

I'm presently waiting for them to onboard me, but I'll be working on yet another spacecraft program for a large space company. Unfortunately it's a contracting job, but any port in a storm & I just got a call last week about a job I had previously interviewed with that same company but didn't get that other job. This is a different manager than before so there might be a chance to score another direct-hire position & continue my financial goals of buying a house sometime soon. They're doing some interesting work in my academic wheelhouse, semiconductor device physics, so it might be a good fit, I just got submitted today. I hit it off with both the recruiters I spoke with for their agency, so they're enthusiastic about pushing me to the company. So to recap, I've already got a job & no I'm waiting to maybe get a better job, all within the space of 3 weeks. A month ago, I didn't really have much going on, a lot of applications, but no solid replies.",

If a company knows you're desperate they are almost always going to low-ball you and try to screw you over. I feel like countering is a much better look than immediately jumping at something. You nailed it, why would you want to work for a place that's actively trying to screw people over?",
