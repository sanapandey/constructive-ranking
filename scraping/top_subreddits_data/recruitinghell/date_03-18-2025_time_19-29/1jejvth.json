    "selftext": "As of last Friday, after overcoming a layoff in August 2024, 400+ applications, 35+ interviews, 8 months of searching, I finally have accepted an offer!\n\nBefore you even begin ask - throughout this time I did everything. Spent weeks revising resume for ATS. Networked on and off LinkedIn. I reached out to connections for referrals and advice. 8 months of brutal uncertainty and finally the wind has shifted. Here\u2019s what I have to say: \n\nLayoffs are interesting. \n\nIt\u2019s like falling down a short cliff into the bottom of a cave. It\u2019s sharp and painful at first, but after a moment, you collect what\u2019s happened and you dust off your pants, get back up on your feet. \n\nThen it quickly becomes this unknown thing you have to navigate. You don\u2019t know many steps it\u2019ll take in total, hours you\u2019ll spend, tracks you\u2019ll retrace over and over again.\n\nEventually you\u2019re going to find a way out, but there is not the slightest amount of time, or intuition that will tell you how soon it\u2019s going to be. It took me months and months to realize that, no matter how hard I work \u2014 I could be the perfect candidate with the best experience, give excellent interviews, have an impressive referral from a connection, and still not be the one to land the role. \n\nWhatever advice is on here that you\u2019ve already seen\u2014 it\u2019s all mostly true. It\u2019s really difficult out there and I cannot stress how bewildered this job market is, but if there is ONE singular piece of advice I could share now that I\u2019ve made it to the other side: always be yourself. \n\nTo really share your true self is a great chance to open up doors. I really believe when you are yourself with others, whether that\u2019s a friend or hiring manager, it allows you to create connections, and bring these professional individuals into your network. Take time with your thoughts, share your personality with the interview panel, whatever it takes to get these people to really meet you - not the version of you desperate for your next job. \n\nI\u2019ve heard studies hailing the \u2018beer test\u2019 theory of managers hiring someone base off if they\u2019d \u2018go out for a beer\u2019 with them - I find this to be true, and also a reflection of the times I\u2019ve previously been offered roles just possibly because the directors liked me. \n\nGood luck out there - and take it one day at a time.
