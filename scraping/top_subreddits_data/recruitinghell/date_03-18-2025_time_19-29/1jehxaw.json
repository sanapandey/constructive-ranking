The comments is full of people struggling with landing even an interview for a simple job, yet he thinks it's insane if you can't find a job within two weeks.. sorry dude I guess everyone else is just too fussy",

I'm worth more/have more pride than that\" the company is question is usually McDonald's or Walmart or the local grocery store. These idiots have never been unemployed and literally don't know what it feels like.",
