I thought \u201cboy my resume saved me.\u201d\n\nNope. You won\u2019t be surprised but when I got to work the first day everyone was super attractive.  4 boys and like 15 girls, and their CREEPY male bosses. \n\nIt was clear they were using the system to pick only attractive people.  They picked me not because of what I did, but I guess because they thought I would be good eye candy to their weird ass art harem.  I accepted a different, slightly lesser position in an entirely different line of work the next day (private school logistics).  This must have been 2013-2015ish iirc.",

As far as I know, most companies using this kind of service don't ever watch the video, they just review the report that calls out performance on the specific things they asked for, so the filtering is not this obvious.\n\nImo these services are a way to launder discrimination because if something off happens they can point to the service & its black box algorithm and claim they had nothing to do with it.",
