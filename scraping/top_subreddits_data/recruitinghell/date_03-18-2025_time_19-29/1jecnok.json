    "selftext": "I am getting a job as a driver for a concrete mixer after 13 months of unemployment. They are going to pay for the training and liscensing for me to get a class B CDL and pay me a wage as I am getting it. Now I wouldn't call this my dream job at all because I am going to be working very long hours in the early morning but, at this point I'll take it.\n\n\nI don't really have any advice for other job seekers because I thought I didn't do very good at the interview. I think I had much better interviews for a lot of jobs that rejected or ghosted me.",
