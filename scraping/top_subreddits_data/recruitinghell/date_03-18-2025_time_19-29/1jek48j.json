    "selftext": "It has messed up my mental health.  Why will I apply for jobs for over a year and get no offer?\n\nIn 2021/2022 I will get screened and interviewed over the phone and the same day by 5pm or next day by 9am, the offer letter and onboarding documents would be waiting for me in my email inbox.\n\nNowadays, Job hunting is like begging someone to put food in your mouth because you're hungry.\n\nI grew up in my home country and business is a more popular thing over there compared to jobs because it's a third world country with limited jobs. I only moved to this fucked up country USA because I was born here and felt my citizenship was \"waisting\" if i stayed back in Nigeria.\n\nAfter the humiliation and insults from numerous companies especially **NJ TRANSIT** that made me commute all the way to port authority terminal for an interview only for them to repost the job this week; I am NO LONGER interested in job hunting!!\n\nFuck this, I will go and look for money to provide for myself, I'm no longer depending on this shitty job market and the stupid, clueless talent acquisition department.\n\nWhat sort of foolishness is going on in this country that a qualified, able-bodied 25 year old will be begging for A JOB and nobody is willing to hire??\n\n",

I'm thinking there is no way in fuck someone around these parts can compete with me. Got a second interview. Wore a suit and tie. Nope. Denied this morning. I would just love to see the people who are getting hired over me. It felt bad just because I didn't think anyone could come close to wowing the \"judges*, but at the same time I don't want to drive in massive traffic for 2 hours a day on most days anyways. I'm back into fitness and I've been having a lot of fun with that while working my super easy part time remote job even though it's not great career wise.",
