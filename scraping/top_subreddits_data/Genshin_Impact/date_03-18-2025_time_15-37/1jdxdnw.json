If Skirk is tangentially related, so be it, but she currently isn't so it's not her marketing.\n\nPatch-wise, we already have our marketing. 5.5 is the Volcano and the end of the Natlan's World Quest. As for 5.6, it's most likely the Mare Jivari and Dainsleif's Quest, probably both being connected. Enjou being there also gives us more evidence for this, and especially Enjou death flags since he's now part of the main story, via Kinich's quest. \n\n5.7 is most likely empty, and 5.8 is the Summer Event, we basically know that already.",

I think they might've better paced the whole theme in Natlan and will continue with the nation's story into further patches as well. Nod Krai is only teased as of now, but we're still in Natlan and still exploring big chunks of its lore. The upcoming patch is still Natlan's core regions.

And with fontaine especially, the lines from travail were just referenced, but the story wasn\u2019t built around them, like they were just referenced them for the sake of it not being wrong. Travail has a line where it says the hydro archon wants to judge all other gods, so furina gets a line where she says she\u2019d judge all other gods, but she never actually does or attempts this in the story, the story is about something else.\n\nThen you compare it to the dendro gemstone, added in 3.0, which very obviously references the events of the sumeru AQ, way more clearly than any other gemstone or travail line. Definitely gives the impression that they only had a general idea of each nation\u2019s story at the start (not to mention the original beta description for the dendro gemstone was completely different and had nothing to do with sumeru\u2019s story)\n\nThe travail description for natlan hasn\u2019t had anything to do with the natlan AQ yet, so we\u2019ll have to see if they still try to connect it.",

It becomes incredibly obvious once we actually look at the lore.\n\nThe Scarlet-Eyed Youth was the successor to Xbalanque, and the Pyro Archon immediately after Xbalanque. He became the Pyro Archon, most likely, after his success in ending Och-kan's reign. The reason why it'd be redacted is because he directly asked somebody to erase his name from history, to inspire others to follow in his footsteps without having a direct idol to look towards. \n\nXbalanque being the \"he,\" also makes sense. His dream would've either been for humans to rise up against those who controlled them, or for Och-kan to not be corrupted given that the two were basically best friends. In any case, the Scarlet-Eyed Youth would've succeeded in both examples, as he both defeated Och-kan, and became the second Pyro Archon. \n\nNow most people would argue that the Scarlet-Eyed Youth isn't part of the Archon Quest, but he indirectly is given that Bona can be part of it if the World Quest is completed. This basically canonizes the entire World Quest to the Archon Quest as well, along with the lore related to it.\n\nSo basically, we have a legendary Scarlet-Eyed Youth who **erased** his name from history, and followed in the footsteps of Xbalanque, who's entire intention of defeating the Sovereign was to allow for humans to defeat the tyrants that ruled over them, **his dream**. That's just what I've noticed though, but it makes the most sense given what we know.",
