My understanding is that if you are ar a negative balance for too long or too far down you can be banned.\n\nI don't know if codashop works differently or anything, never used it myself, but there are plenty of incidents of people getting \"gifted\" a welkin, only for someone to do this and get the reciever in trouble.
