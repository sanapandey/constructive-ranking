She can fit into a lot of teams.\n\nIn the early game though, when you don't yet have artifacts to sustain Oz's field time, Lisa may be more useful for easily triggering Electro-based reactions without any downtime.\n\n* A very basic pairing would be Lisa and Barbara. Both are freely obtainable as you progress, both are catalyst users that apply their element on regular attack, so you can make a very low-investment Electro-Charged reaction duo with just these two.\n\nIt's also feasible to build both. Fischl is primarily built for off-field electro application, while Lisa *can* be built as on-field dps. Lisa's skill doesn't generate many particles, which can be fixed with Fischl. It's not a bad idea to have both if you need lots of electro damage.\n\n* This is typically referred to as \"battery\", where one character's skill generate plenty of particles, so that other team members' bursts recharge faster. Fischl is one of the best \"battery\" for electro characters.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you and which character you enjoy more. You are still in the early game (I assume?) so any character will work once you understand their roles.",

Since you can play with only 1 character at a time; you are encouraged to use 3 characters that provide support when they are NOT on the field, in the way of buffs or elemental application. In this regard, you would switch to Fischl, use either her Elemental Skill or Burst (only one or the other) so she summons Oz to the field, and switch back to whatever character you want to play. While you are doing stuff with the other character, Oz (Fischl's Bird) will be there doing damage and providing electro application in case you can/want to react with it. Once the Oz is gone, you would switch back to Fischl and use the Burst or Elemental Skill (whichever you have ready) and repeat.\n\nMind you, Kaeya (Eye Patch Cryo Guy) is meant to be played similarly; bursting with him to create those icicles around your character at play, and switch to someone else. Thou in early game your Energy Recharge will be really low (nothing you can really do, since you just don't have Artifacts/Weapons/Levels with enough ER; you are meant to Burst with him on cooldown to have those icicles around you most of the time, while playing another character on the field.",

Chasca is sightly faster than Wanderer and I believe can reach sightly further, but I think they share the same \"fly up\" limit. Xilonen does feel way better to climb than anyone else. And Mavuika is just... Mavuika. Most notably, she has a jump-fly-cancel boost that can do up to 7 times in a row (outside of Natlan) that will give her A TON of speed and distance covered.\n\nCheck [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1hubr8v/with_this_skill_mavuika_is_now_the_fastestrunning/) Reddit Post with a video of Mavuika if you want to see what it looks like. Mind you, that Mavuika is C6. Her C1 grants more skill/bike duration, and her C6 refills the \"energy\" bar once every X seconds but the cooldown is such that it allows her to keep refreshing it with her Elemental Skill forever as long as she doesn't get into combat.\n\nStill, C0 Mavuika can do that speed-boost jump you see in the video 6 times in a row before going into cooldown; and cooldown is not that long (she can spend more time on bike than without).",

Ez rotation, Arle E > Xilonen E > XQ EQ(E) > Bennett EQ > Arle CA and go ham\n\n\nJust be ready to climb the pillars with Xilonen E when they appear so you can stun the boss, it loses 15% HP and it enters its weakened state",

Considering the abyss is one of the \"end game\" modes, yeah a newer 1 or 2 year account may have some trouble with it but an invested 2+ year account should have a slightly easier time clearing it. \nSkill issue is a big thing. My lineup is essentially the same for most abyss' (welkin user) and some rotations are much more annoying than others. I hate the wolf lord with a passion, struggled a few times to get 36 stars. This abyss I cleared almost in record time. \nIt may just be optimizing your rotations, borrowing an artifact here or there, etc. If you're at 35(I mean depending if your clock says 6:59 or like 4:45), I think you'll definitely make it to 36 after a few different cycles of abyss buffs :3 maybe today's was just bad. And like the other commenter said, you can always post your roster and/or teams your running and see if there's something to be said for that.",
