All you gotta do is look at the cyber truck for an example lol, how many years were they behind on release vs what Elon promised? And his genius requirements of stainless steel body panels which is notoriously difficult to stamp form into shape because of the springback, resulting in horrendous variance in the panel gaps on every vehicle?\n\nHe\u2019s the face of the company, he didn\u2019t get these astronauts home safe himself. He\u2019s busy running around with his son by his side gutting the government lol, he doesn\u2019t have time to do this himself",
