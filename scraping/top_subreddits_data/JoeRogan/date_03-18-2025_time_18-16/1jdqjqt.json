Biden made such a mess before he left or technically the Democrats that were behind his presidency, we could be looking at ending up in a conflict because of them.

That\u2019s a sick person. It was never like this. Whoever won, won and every American went on with their life.",

After Starliner\u2019s thruster malfunctions and helium leaks, NASA deemed it too risky to use for the return, opting instead to integrate Wilmore and Williams into the ISS crew rotation with Crew-9. Former NASA officials, like Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, have disputed Musk\u2019s claim, stating no such offer reached senior leadership. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson also denied awareness of any direct proposal from Musk, suggesting communication breakdowns or exaggeration on Musk\u2019s part.\n\nso there was no actual formal offer by musk, he just wanted to use it as a talking point so Elon could say \"biden didn't want to bring home those astronauts\"",

One of which Trump shamelessly did an ad read for his car, when was the last time a president was so tacky? Not to mention the person who runs DOGE literally gets billions of government contacts and then had that 400m Tesla contract that had to be walked back. \n\nIt\u2019s a terrible thing because it\u2019s completely avoiding the process that was already in place. Criminals still have rights that can\u2019t be ignored. It\u2019s fucking terrible when the administration is going against a court order too. \n\nI didn\u2019t realise the art of negotiation was completely leveraging against Ukraine, basically insinuating Zelensky is a dictator while having a spat with him in the White House and removing intel to Ukraine. All of the positions he and Hegseth have revealed gives up so much to Russia as a starting point. \n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t war hawks. No one wants war, such a stupid fucking talking point. There\u2019s no point in a deal that results in the conflict being a stalemate, then hundreds of thousands of men died for absolutely nothing. Ukrainians don\u2019t want to be stuck in limbo having Russia fuck with their internal politics, back separatist movements like they do in multiple nations. The loss of territory, enforced neutrality and no European peacekeepers isn\u2019t good enough. Why is Ukraine being leveraged harder instead of Russia?",

Biden was one of the more pro union presidents in a while. The difference is Trump is doing a ad read for a unelected bureaucrat in his government who happens to own an automaker because he feels Musk is getting too much criticism.

Billionaires could not solve world hunger overnight, a lack of money isn\u2019t the problem, a lack of logistics and abundance of corruption at all levels will ensure that it remains a problem. Tens of Billions are spent year after year to try eliminate world hunger and nothing happens. California spent billions on trying to solve homelessness and instead it ballooned, all the while $250k a year jobs managing the various programs cropped up and were given to unqualified people.

How many liberal tears comments do I have to hear to totally throw that idea out the window?\n\nThey party has lost touch with the working class, that's for sure. There's also a lot of other problems with the party itself, but that's usually solved by just having a strong candidate come forward and rallying everyone, like Obama and Trump did.\n\nBut the main reason is media. Most people get news and information from social media, especially younger people. The supposed Democratic strongholds of legacy media only have liberal boomers watching any more. Tiktok and Twitter have been super anti Democrat from all sides - the right is totally captured by anti establishment lunacy, the left is as well, and Dems are sitting in a shrinking media bubble that only old people pay attention to and are attacked from all sides. \n\nWhich is why it's perfection vs chaos.",

It may not be Nazis but the Nazis weren't Nazis in 1928 either. Elon's role of going through the entire government and unilaterally stopping congressionally approved agencies and spending, Trump's letter for letter adherence to the government takeover laid out in project 2025 - it's absolutely the most authoritarian administration we've ever seen and we are closer to losing our democracy than at any point since the civil war. I get that people can be hyperbolic with language, but forgive me if after 25 years of being called a communist because I think a public healthcare option is more efficient and effective, the right can collectively get their panties out of their asses if being called a Nazi is just too much, but oh yeah we're also blindly following the most authoritarian strong man in US history.

To say that SpaceX isn't anything but NASA is just recognizing that SpaceX got all its roots from NASA and is now doing the stuff NASA should be doing. Ergo, why does no one realize it's just NASA, post-billionaire privatization selloff of America^TM. \n\nThe rest of the world has accepted what's going on and are transitioning to wartime economies. It's our first rodeo though so we genuinely don't have a past set of experiences to draw from to be afraid of what's going on. Never before have so many WWII veterans and survivors said \"I never thought it would happen again.\" I find it hard to ignore that canary in the coal mine. \n\n\nI wanted to add a bit about how there have been conspiracy theories for decades about how the World Wars were a depopulation and rocket propulsion systems testing exercise by the worlds oligarchy cuz the nobles were getting too uppity, but I didn't think anyone would take it super seriously if I did.",

Williams became the station commander in September and both she and Wilmore have worked conducting experiments and spacewalks during their time there.\n\nSounds a lot like Trump is blaming Biden for the astronauts being 'stranded' so he/Elon could take credit for their heroic 'rescue.'",

The same guy who just said he found magic money computers? \n\nThis was talked about at the end of January when Trump told Musk to go get them now and he still doesn't get them until 2 months later which was the apparent agreed upon date with Biden bc he didn't trust Boeing after getting them stranded. \n\nAll credit to Musk's team for being able to get them bc Musk has no idea what he's doing with that. If he did I'd love to know the 5 things he's done in the past week since he's somehow running Tesla, SpaceX, X, and going through all government agencies and finding \"fraud and abuse\" while finding time to go on podcasts, doing interviews, flying around in Air Force One. \n\nHe wants everyone to return to the office I'd love to know the last time he was in an office working. \n\nPoint is the guy is full of shit and bought Trump's campaign. Who is shocked he'd throw Biden under the bus? If he was ready to do it he would have done it in January when Trump told him to.",

And now that that mission is completed, the four have been replaced and were able to return. As scheduled. So they weren't any more stranded than the two astronauts who didn't go would have been stranded if they went.  They were on a mission, and because of circumstances, had their mission extended. There was no rescue. It was nothing more than a scheduled return, as mundane as every other scheduled return that we don't hear about because Elon can't figure out how to claim he's being a hero.\n\nElon makes it sound like they were up there just twiddling their thumbs, waiting for someone to come and rescue them.
