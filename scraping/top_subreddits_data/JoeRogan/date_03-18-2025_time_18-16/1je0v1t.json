And so in that regard, I will have respectfully disagree with you, and it\u2019s actually largely because of my interpretation of what you outlined: *you are absolutely correct in that the US was in the midst of a recovery.* Biden\u2019s achievements or lack thereof were ultimately irrelevant in the scope of the election, as the people were hurting and wanted an easy scapegoat - something which they could all too easily assign to Biden. Right or wrong, it was what happened, and the approval ratings leading up to the election made this fact clear. That said, it seems terribly misguided to have selected Biden\u2019s second in command to run in the face of this, especially considering that she was so hesitant to distance herself from his policies. Again, whether these policies were successful or not is irrelevant when the perspective of American voters had already been decided - it would have been far more practical to have selected another Democratic candidate who could offer Americans an alternative to Trump without all the baggage of Biden.\n\nI don\u2019t think stating this is propaganda - it\u2019s just the reality of the situation.

Less than a fourth of Americans approved of project 2025 but voted for someone who has followed it almost to the letter. Are those who voted for Trump and did not approve of 2025 remorseful? For the most part no, because the policy was secondary to the candidate - which is something voters do care about.\n\nKamala was associated with Biden, and so voters didn\u2019t want her. Her only chance was to distance herself from him, and she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s really as simple as that.\n\nTo be clear: I am agreeing with you about voters not wanting the person who is in power, but Kamala for all intents and purposes was seen as an extension of the person who was in power (Biden) hence why she was a terrible candidate.",

Were the shoe on the other foot and Republicans were swept, my assessment would be the same: they ran bad candidates who didn\u2019t win.\n\nSo while, yes, incumbent administrations absolutely had an uphill battle, a candidate\u2019s quality rests in their ability to adapt to and overcome the challenges of their election. Democrats should have realized this and either run someone new or put a fresh coat of paint on Kamala so that she appeared new. And yes, I do believe that had she gone up and presented herself as having a different perspective on the economy than Biden it would have helped. The details of these alleged differences wouldn\u2019t have ultimately mattered, as again, policy is secondary, but it would have provided voters with a talking point when Republican\u2019s economic criticism comes out. Kamala seemed to understand this at some level when she insisted, \u201cI\u2019m not Joe Biden\u201d but then she proceeded to present herself as more of the same.\n\nSo yes, I think she was a terrible candidate. If the word \u201cterrible\u201d is too strong, then she was at the very least the *wrong* candidate. This isn\u2019t propaganda - it\u2019s recognition that something went wrong and that a different solution could have been found. We have the benefit of hindsight now to provide clarity on this, and to simply throw our arms up and claim that there was no winning for Democrats regardless of election strategy is a waste of that hindsight and is akin to surrendering. I\u2019m hopeful that Democrats, instead of just saying \u201cthere was nothing we could have done,\u201d will learn from what could have been differently and adapt. Come 2028 they can stick to the same song and dance or they can update their approach, recognize when the public isn\u2019t vibing with something, and adapt.\n\nAlso just want to say that I appreciate your perspective and the discussion on all this.",

It's OK to not agree with everything nor have to do everything that our allies do.  All of this is for nothing.  Again, Putin and his associates are well known, and he isn't going to far outside of Russia for as long as he is on planet earth.  His country has been drastically impacted by economic sanctions, no one likes him and the only allies he has is a poor ass North Korea and the other Asian nations to the east of him only because he is a buffer between them and the West.  Spending any amount of time to investigate and prove he is a war criminal is a joke.\n\n>Do you think the choices being made have no effect on our own national security?

I love my country to the nth degree, and I'm all for securing our interests when it makes the most sense not only for our society but our allies at large.  However, I'm not OK with getting involved in every conflict that occurs, supplying one group with military resources one moment while supplying their enemy the next while this terrible cycle continues. NATO and the US are not this non fallible entity that does no wrong ever.\n\nThe middle east is a mess and much of is due to our direct involvement with that area over the last 40 years.  They as a society have to figure their shit out regardless of how we feel of their governments.  In regard to Talsi's stance, she wants peace and every time we go and remove a \"dictator\" the country ends up in turmoil for the next decade that winds up bleeding into surrounding countries.  So, no I'm not all that outraged because she went and spoke to Assad to gather insight into the Syrian issues at the time.  Now look, he fled the country, and Syria is now on the brink of another civil war.    \n\nI'm all for ensuring that our allies and ourselves are protected and frankly to think because we aren't a part of some group that doesn't condemn Putin is a joke.  It's pointless.  There is no need to investigate anything nor put an ounce of effort into it.  Do you really need a group of countries to get together for them to announce Putin is a war criminal?  Furthermore, no matter what your stance is, if you actually believe this administration is not going to work with other countries for intelligence or that our allies aren't going to provide intelligence because we don't do dog and pony show of announcing Putin as a war criminal you are gullible.",

Europe has agreed to raise its debt ceiling in the interest of defense and secured a loan for $900bln to build their own defense industry. The UK is having 'coalition of the willing' meetings and discussing boots on the ground in Ukraine. Poland is expressing interest in developing its own nuclear weapons program. France has extended its nuclear umbrella to all of NATO. All of these things are consequences of what you consider a joke. If avoiding WW3 is the aim, we're doing it wrong. \n\nThings are considerably worse than you seem to think. Eastern Europe's primary security concern is russia. Having a director of intelligence that's hostile to the only mechanism of defense of their entire identity as independent states isn't good. Regardless of how you feel personally, go have a look at the europeans reaction to JD Vance's speech at Munich security conference. They don't consider us allies anymore, bro. I can't say I actually blame them.",
