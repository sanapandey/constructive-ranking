Social security is necessary. Healthcare is necessary. We have these programs for a reason. I'm totally okay with getting rid of truly corrupt things. But we have no reason to believe that has happened, or will happen under Trump. He literally fired the inspectors general right off the bat. \n\n>Saving money and leaving more control to the states is more in line with the ideals in which our Republic was formed. \n\nAdorable that you've convinced yourself that this is actually what's happening. \n\n>The Democrats weaponize the judicial branch and use judges to stall legal executive actions for political reasons.\n\nYea, no. That's literally what Trump is doing. And you're spreading his lies that he uses to excuse this behavior. Fucking moron.\n\n>\"You people\" just proves you're ignorant and have an absolutist us versus them mentality.
