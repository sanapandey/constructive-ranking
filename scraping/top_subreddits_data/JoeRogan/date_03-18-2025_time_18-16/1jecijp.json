They are too fucking stupid to understand that they are doing the Streisand Effect and making the case for inclusiveness, and its real world example, which isn't a strawman of 'blue haired libtards', instead people who stood up for American ideals regardless of their identity. But alas, their followers will never acknowledge that this exists because that would require them to actually engage with what they say they believe and the real world, which is an intellectual task that is a bit too complex than just following blindly, which is all they know how-to do.",

They lack the power and control to be able to control all sources of information, thus they overplay their hand and expose more people to these stories to remind them how full of shit they are. Most people did not vote for this, seeing it reminds them of that, and reminds them that the administration still isn't dealing with issues that are directly effecting them but they do have the time to waste doing things like this.",

You cannot say that there exists a world where all persons are created equal and then say that some people do not count because of arbitrary factors in order to create a system of superiority and harm.\n\nIts not that hard to understand, but you will keep begging the question because you don't want to deal with the conclusions of your ideology while I have already spelled out mine.",

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. **If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past**\n\n- Sartre\n\nWe are at the bold part.",
