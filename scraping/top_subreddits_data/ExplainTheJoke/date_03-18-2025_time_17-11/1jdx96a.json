But he even attacked the people supporting him today by cheering and wearing his merch and he started pointing out people in the crowd wearing that shirt (they're in Brussels and he's in his final year wrestling, so WWE is selling customized shirts for every location he makes an appearance at). And he makes a comment that none of those people wearing his shirt truly cared or supported him, they just took from him, including that kid over there - and then the camera cut to this kid.\n\nThe meme is referencing an adult whose inner child must feels as shocked and betrayed as that real child seeing John Cena become the opposite of who his character has been for nearly his whole career.\n\nHere's the video of the full promo, this section referenced here is around the 16 minute mark: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExQYm6gintE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExQYm6gintE)",

Generally, they have the creative control of how their matches play out, but big story beats (including who wins the match) and how that plays into the promotion's narrative will have been agreed when booking the match.\n\nIt's important to note that fans of wrestling are generally looking for *drama*, not for predictable outcomes, like a soap opera. They want to see strong characters, high stakes games, bitter rivalries, inspiring underdog stories, upsets and frequent title changes, shocking betrayals etc.\n\nAs such, most wrestlers aren't looking for wins per se, they are looking to be included in key narratives that are good for building their character and reputation, and given the spotlight at the right time so that they can ultimately shine.\n\nOf course, the biggest narrative tends to center around the world championship of the promotion, so having your character win key matches and be seen as one of the strongest is important if you're going for the big leagues.

He\u2019s in the middle of the match so all he knows is he definitely can\u2019t finished this match as planned but also wrestling doesn\u2019t have injuries\\* anymore than opera has injuries.

John Cena, during his full time run with WWE, was the top babyface in the company and the entire industry.\n\nHowever, there was always a split in the audience between his child fans who loved him and the older male fans who booed him. As he got towards the end of his full time run, he started to lose more and do more to \u2018put over\u2019 other wrestlers (that is to use his status to make them look good). \n\nCena is a 16 time world champion. He wants a 17th title to eclipse Ric Flair\u2019s record. He won the right to a world championship match at Wrestlemania at Elimination Chamber. This will be against the current top babyface Cody Rhodes.\n\nIn storyline, he has aligned himself with The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) who is playing a corporate overlord character, apparently so he can have the weight of WWE behind him to win that 17th title. \n\nLast night, on WWE Raw, he spoke for the first time about his actions and was heavily booed throughout, showing a whiny, complaining attitude and how everything was the fans\u2019 fault, even saying he was in an abusive relationship with them. \n\nThe children who supported him are now seeing their hero act like a mean-spirited, angry bully. \n\nOf course, none of this is actually real, he is just ensuring that there is interest in his match and that the fans will back Rhodes. He\u2019s being as generous as he was during the later days of his full time run.",

At that time, his cousin Roman Reigns was on a record-setting run with the main championship, and a lot of people wanted to see Rock vs Roman. However, Rock is busy with Hollywood, so while everyone was waiting for him to show up, Cody Rhodes took the opportunity to get over with the fans and become the face of the company. WWE had to change their plans fpr Rock vs Roman because of how popular Cody is.\n\nAt Wrestlemania 40 last year, Rock and Roman teamed up against Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins (Roman's old tag partner, and Cody's old nemesis). Since Rock and Roman won, the main event of Wrestlemania was made a no disqualification match. Cody then beat Roman and ended his 1400+ days long title reign.\n\nEven though Rock is a corporate heel who only looks out for his family, Cody kinda won his respect. For the rest of 2024, Cody fought off the rest of Roman's cousins (who had been getting themselves over while Roman was away), and kept the title for the whole year. Rock only appeared once, to make a weird 3-finger gesture after a match between two family members. And then he appeared again a month ago to tell Cody he \"wants his soul\".\n\nJohn Cena meanwhile announced that 2025 would be his last year wrestling. After he failed to win the Royal Rumble, he simply said that he wants a 17th world title, and that he's entering the Elimination Chamber. After Cena won the Chamber, Cody came out to congratulate him, and then The Rock came out (with Travis Scott, randomly). Cody rejected selling his soul to the Rock, Cena hugged him in a \"good work kid\" kinda way. And then Cena looked at the Rock, Rock made a throat-slitting gesture (this time with two fingers), and Cena turned heel by kicking Cody in the balls.\n\nPeople expect Rock to appear a few more time leading up to Wrestlemania, and possibly have a match (but probably not at Wrestlemania, maybe sometimes later). Otherwise though, he only shows up a handful of times every year.",

Every good story needs a villain and the goal of any wrestler is ultimately to put on a great show for the fans. It's also worth mentioning that one great show could be preceded by months and months of build up and character growth. Sometimes years of character growth and build up in the example of John Cena. He's been a bad guy once at the very beginning of his career, and then went 20 some odd years being the good guy. It's why this heel turn is so compelling. You can probably find some clips from Raw last night where he could barely get in a word over the boos of the crowd. All of this is to make his opponent (Cody Rhodes) look like the greatest hero in the world so either we get a moment of triumph when Cody eventually beats him at WrestleMania. That or maybe the more compelling result of John Cena winning and being hated that much more.\n\nIt's why wrestling is so great",

It eventually evolved into the colourful T-shirts, baseball caps and jorts wearing character that was the face of the company while simultaneously being hated by a large, older male segment of the audience. \n\nWhat Cena never had, however, was what we call \u2018go away heat\u2019. Heat in wrestling is when the audience hates you. Normally, it\u2019s a good thing, it means your character is working as the audience wants to see the babyface beat you. Go away heat is a bad thing, it means the audience is actively changing the channel and not showing up for shows.

Even thought the IRL stuff is kinda interwoven into the storyline when it\u2019s convenient. \n\nWrestlers as characters have different motivations, but generally they all want to win titles. Theres a rough hierarchy to the belts themselves, but just ignore that for a minute. \n\nWrestlers as people who are trying to make a living also *kinda* want to win belts (or maybe really want to win them) because having a belt placed on you is a rough approximation of your place in the company hierarchy. \n\nTo have the top belt (in WWE this is the Undisputed Championship which Cody Rhodes currently holds) is a company publicly annointing you as the number one \u201cin storyline\u201d face of the company. Basically the highest career achievement for an individual and the vast majority of wrestlers will never touch this belt. \n\nOther belts are given for all kinds of reasons: it\u2019s convenient for the story, it\u2019s a test to see if you can handle the pressure of being champ, it\u2019s a thank you for months or years of good work, it\u2019s an accident because someone got hurt or couldn\u2019t work, or it\u2019s straight up a better move for your character to win or lose a belt. \n\nSome belts have certain attributes associated with them. The WWE Intercontinental Championship is historically known as the \u201cworking man\u201d belt, usually placed on a wrestler who has been making lots of appearances, doing their job well, and carrying shows week to week. \n\nThe top top belt (the Undisputed) is for the top level faces and heels. The up and comers have less prestigious belts to fight about like the US title or tag team titles. \n\nAs for how winners are chosen, that can vary a ton. There have been winners decided literally during the match, just before, or even months or years in advance.",
