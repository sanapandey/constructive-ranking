Normally, when you say someone (almost universally a man) left the toilet seat up you\u2019re pointing out a simple mistake. Her having stuff in the bathroom isn\u2019t a mistake, so OPs question is valid because there is a hidden dialog that the creator of the image is hinting at but not saying:\n\n\u201cMen (occasionally) leave the toilet seat up. Whereas women (constantly) leave all their makeup paraphernalia in the bathroom.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. Doesn\u2019t work perfectly, and it\u2019s a very tired man v. woman observational joke.",
