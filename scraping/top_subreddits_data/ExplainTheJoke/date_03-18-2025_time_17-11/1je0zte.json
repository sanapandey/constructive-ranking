If you go a long while without it you will feel the same but then when you nut again you notice how tiered you get all of a sudden with no will to do anything. It's a big load of energy and the best nutrients your body has to offer to create a new life. And you give it away. So you become blind cuz you become very low energy, unable to have awareness of the spiritual side of reality. It doesn't make sense for most people cuz we are so disconnected with this reality that it just makes no sense to us",
