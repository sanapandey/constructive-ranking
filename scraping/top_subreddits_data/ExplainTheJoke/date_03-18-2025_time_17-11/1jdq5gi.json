When stricter spelling rules were established in the US they decided that a bunch of words could be simplified. Other English speaking places all shared their spelling with the UK and so when they further standardized their spelling it meant there was a distinction between American spelling and British spelling. This fact also explains the difference in word evolution between the two nations. \n\nFunnily enough, some words like color could be argued to be more accurately spelled color if you are using a historical precedent. The dropping of the U was in part an effort to get closer to the Latin root words, whereas in Britain there was an attempt to keep the language \"French-like\".",

I certainly agree that the idea of the commonwealth certain has empire and colonial tones too it but it's just a friends club. View it like an EU lite minus the trading: [https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us](https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us) or maybe closer to the UN but on a smaller scale. The Empire is died in 1997 when the UK handed back Honk Kong to China but arguably ended in the 1950s after the Suez Crisis and the start of decolonisation.. Frankly I think the main benefit of being in the Commonwealth is to take part in the Commonwealth games...\n\nIt doesn't even require a British Royal to be the head of it. It has only had two heads and they have been British Royals but it is not a requirement and is not a hereditary title. Nor is the Head of the Commonwealth declared head of sate for all the members . Heck, there are countries like Togo and Gabon which were ex-french colonies not even British ones in it now.\n\nKing Charles is the king of the \"Commonwealth realms\" which include: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. But again, that isn't the same as the Commonwealth. Nor is there a unified foreign policy or anything like that across these nations and are all independent of each other and the UK.\n\nEdit: had the quote in spoilers instead.
