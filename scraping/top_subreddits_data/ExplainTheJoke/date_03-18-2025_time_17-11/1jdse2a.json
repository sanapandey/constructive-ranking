The red haired child dies at the climax, but the back haired child lives and goes on to have a daughter.\n\n\nHis daughter is seen in the second image, making a sand castle in front of her grandmother. But the other woman never had grandchildren because her son died and it's very likely she was never given a real reason as to how or why her son went missing and never came home.\n\n\nIt's a dark joke, surrounded by tragedy and heartbreak.\u00a0",

He fought all so he could help his friend Jotaro save his Mom who would die otherwise and stop a freaky Vampire that controlled him to try and Kill Jotaro when they first met.   \nKakyoin never got to grow up, have kids, or tell his mom goodbye.",
