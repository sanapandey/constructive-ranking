But I think her ex is too much of an outlier to make any determinations about height/strength. Definitely doesnt always mean strong, but it probably helps by virtue of having more muscle volume- even if cross sectional area isnt all that different. I dont think its a coincidence that the current strong man is 6 foot 9. And while Haf\u00fe\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson is definitely an outlier, you can look over all the people in his strength category. I would be very surprised to see someone at 5 foot 2\n\nKind of like how being a woman doesnt always mean being weaker than a man, but generally men have an advantage in raw strength.",
