It works, thats how hes always hugged me since I was a little bitty kid that would hang off his neck and probably be about to get picked up, it hasn't changed as I've become an adult(I'd say \"grown\" but I didn't grow much over 5 feet).\nDon't any of y'all try to make that weird or ruin the hugs.",

But I just walk around doing the head nods to people as I pass them. You can generally feel leering eyes on you or sense the people you should avoid. \n\nBut basically we just live life, not looking for help. If there's something out of reach we just climb, or chuck something at it to knock it down and move on, or we find something to stand on to help get up and over stuff. \n\nIt wasn't till I was next to someone that was over 6 feet(I'm not one of those people that think anything less than that is short. Cause everyone's taller than me, it's just that this dude happens to be  6 feet+) and he  looks like the hulk(sweet teddy bear of a guy though) that I was hit with the realization of the size difference and was like \"my gawd. You're as big as a building and could lift a car, and you're broader than about 4 of me. If you wanted to do bad out there in the world, or even to me, there's not much I could do to stop you unless someone hands me a gun....\". Thankfully sweet guy though.\n\nEdit for spelling.",

They're very sincere little beings,not a malicious bone in their body. They're sweet, they love you to a fault and would die for you(and I'd die for any one of my animals)You can be 100% comfortable being yourself with them without judgement. You can tell them your deepest darkest secret, feel ok changing in front of them, cry into their fur and they'll still come up to comfort you and want to be goofy or bring you a toy.\n\n I don't consider dogs, cats, bunnies any other animals,  to simply be \"just\" dogs cats and bunnies, or \"just animals\". They're little animals that love and need to be loved and that need to be taken care of and will take care of you in their own way and do everything they can to protect you. I don't consider them to be \"owned\" by me. \n\nI don't compare humans to the stereotypical, \"obedient good boy/ girl\" that may get a head pat and sleep on the porch. I consider my animals that I care for to be my  children and put them on a pedestal and treat them like royalty.  \n\nIts actually pretty sad that people out there don't share the same view on animals as me, so then they think what I've said is an insult when I certainly don't mean it that way. \n\nIf I say youre like a golden retriever it's because you are sincere and kind and make me feel comfortable, and at ease and I just want to be around you, no matter what we're doing. \n\nAll of this wasn't to go off on you, but to explain that being put in the same category as an animal is a HUGE , very rare compliment coming from me, since animals are the purest, kindest, most  Angelic little creations out there. So if I say a human can make me feel as comfortable and content as an animal, you're an incredible human being.",

I've had ex's I wish had smaller boobs, but I've never wished an ex's boobs were bigger (and not because I wouldn't date someone with small boobs, my last relationship before my current one for example I think would be considered quite flat, and again, I would absolutely prefer fully none than too big). And by too much I don't mean from obesity just too big, I find quite a lot of porn very unappealing because of it, and not just when its like absurdly unnatural or something. But yeah anyways, all I'm saying its that anything like this is going to be a personal preference thing, and not something universal.

Incredibly awkward for BOTH parties. I dated a guy for most of 7th grade that I was a full 11\" taller than. At school dances we would slow dance with me on my knees so I could put my head on his shoulder. \n\nAnd honestly, if I don't trust you, I'm NOT letting you potentially pin my arms by hugging from beneath, even if you ARE taller than me. \n\nSo. . . It may be a trauma response to not hug from above, unfortunately. \n\nOr it simply doesn't occur to me as I've been hugging from above since I was 11 years old. At fifty now, it's decades of experience I've never contemplated until reading this thread.\n\nI don't really think about my boobs at all when hugging someone.
