One day, same format meme appear, but the name changed to Xavier. Some people claimed it was copying Pakalu Papito, some say he just change his name to Xavier. As a result, older users remember the profile as Pakalu Papito, so usually when Xavier meme pop up there is usually some people that comment \"its Pakalu Papito!\" to describe the dislike towards Xavier who copied Papito's work.",

Then about 7-10 years ago this guy called Xavier literally just stole his pfp and memes and just changed the name to his own, literally photoshopped the memes with his name over the top, same face and all. He reposted them aggressively, and eventually they became the dominant meme. \n\nIts been so long most people don't even remember lol Pakalu Papito was the original. Seriously though just Google pakalu Papito and you can find out more about this.",
