Tl; Dr: Modern conservatives (after 1950) probably didn't know the origin of the phrase, but the phrase has a recorded history that makes it unambiguously religious in origin.\n\nThe phrase bleeding heart was popular in the 14th-16th centuries, and was associated with the bleeding heart of Jesus, and was used in a positive context. It seems to have dropped off in popularity between 1600 and 1900\n\nHowever, the phrase reappeared in a right wing columnists writings (Westbrook Pegler), as \"bleeding heart liberal\" and \"bleeding heart humanitarian\". It seems it didn't gain much traction outside of his writings for a while, partially because he was so far right for his time.\n\nLater on, it was picked up by prominent politicians such as McCarthy, Nixon, and Reagan. However, it is possible that these politicians did not know the religious origins of this phrase and were just copying a far right columnists catchphrase.",

They were failed by society!\"\n\nThat's why we have victim impact statements at sentencing. It's also why we've passed a spate of laws requiting parole boards to notify victims when their attackers are coming up for parole, or are going to be released. \n\nFor a more recent example look at the push for no cash bail. Back in 2022, in New York, Adam Bennefield was released on no cash bail after violating a protection order that was put in place after he assaulted his wife. Once he was released, he promptly kidnapped her in front of their young children, and murdered her.\n\nThere can be such a thing as too much empathy. Sometimes it gets innocent people like Keaira Bennefield murdered.",

Therefore, no, I do not believe in either extreme of perfect free will or predestination. I\u2019m trying to use Christian terminology because it is more intelligible to most English speakers, but full disclosure I\u2019m a pantheistic-Neoplatonist who\u2019s spent a lot of time studying and being shaped by Buddhism.

'Cherry picking' is 'well this is all true but not the part about shrimp and pork, obviously, but the part about the gays is obviously right.'  They can't speak to internally consistent logic towards which parts are ignored or accepted other than \"well I don't like it,\" or \"because that's what my Pastor told me\" or whatever.\n\nSome Christians recognize that the Bible is a document written and translated by fallible humans, and that a book as important to controlling the populace as it is has not gone without edits designed to fortify that control.  (It's farcical to believe that it would not be.)  To my mind, part of being a 'Good Christian' would be looking at the book with such a critical eye.",

Using that concern to reach out and help them. Empathy is like jumping on the sinking boat with them.\n\nThey said the reason we should be more sympathetic is that we are better able to help by remaining outside of the situation itself.

Your link talks about how important it is to have boundaries and be realistic in your empathy. \n\nHere\u2019s the synopsis from Stuckey\u2019s book from the publisher. \n\n>> Toxic Empathy, Allie Beth Stuckey argues that empathy has become a tool of manipulation by left-wing activists who bully people into believing that they must adopt progressive positions to be loving. She explores the five most heated issues through which toxic empathy is deployed: abortion, gender, sexuality, immigration, and social justice. Progressives use catchy mantras to present their perspective as empathetic, like \u201cabortion is healthcare,\u201d \u201clove is love,\u201d or \u201cno human being is illegal,\u201d but in each case, they ignore the other side of the moral equation. For example, abortion is presented as compassionate for the woman, but what about the human life the procedure kills?\n\n>>This book isn\u2019t about killing empathy; it\u2019s about submitting our empathy to God\u2019s definitions of love, goodness, and justice. Stuckey exposes the logical pitfalls and moral consequences of toxic empathy, equipping Christians with research-backed, Biblical truths to dismantle the progressive lies that have permeated our culture\u2014and our church.",

The commandments are for **you** to love god and for **you** to love your neighbor as yourself. There is no exception to not love your neighbor if you think they are sinful. People can be rebuked out of love, but that has nothing to do with the Bishops message - it is a call to empathy that you do not get to ignore because you believe they are too sinful",

Jesus also said the most important commandment was \u201clove your neighbour as yourself\u201d (Mark 12:31), and obviously this flies in the face of the Trump movement. So they have to reinvent a lot of traditional Christian teachings to fit in with MAGA. This means when they come across actual Christian values such as empathy, they don\u2019t really know what to do. You can generally tell Fake Christians based on how they respond to traditional Christian values.",

So trumpers just do what their told and are saying empathy is evil. This was about 2 months ago, around inauguration time.\n\n\n\nextrapolating from that, the \"devil on her shoulder\", which is what tells you to do bad things, is now confused as apparently it's evil to care about other people. not pictured here is the angel on her other shoulder, which tells you the right thing to do, and would probably also be confused.\u00a0\n\n\nthe author didn't bother to put the devil actually on/above her shoulder because they assumed people would understand what they were trying to do I suppose.",

Assume they do all they say they want to, and end entitlements entirely.  No more Social Security, Medicaid, Disability, etc.  \n\n\n\nWhat are all of those millions of Americans that are too elderly or infirm supposed to do?  There is a substantial population of Americans that rely on government programs to survive.  Literally survive.  So if they take away all of those entitlements, either the states step up their entitlement programs or these people just...die.  Can you imagine a state like Alabama stepping up entitlements to close the gap?  Neither can I, and I live here.\n\n\n\nSo here is where the \"sin of empathy\" rhetoric comes in.  They are laying the groundwork for people to watch these mass deaths without revolting against their masters.\n\n  \nPart of me think this is the tip of the spear for a population culling.  Look, as long as there have been classes in society, the aristocracy has railed against the filthy plebeians getting any resources allocated to them.  The \"parasite class\" in their thoughts, and certainly not worth any empathy.  However, the plebeians have always been essential in a way, doing the work that no one else would.\n\n  \nHowever, this time around there is a wildcard.  Most, if not all, menial jobs will be soon automated with AI and robotics.  Doesn't matter if this is based in real fact or not, if Musk and company believe it and are shaping the world around it.  So, run small businesses and farmers into bankruptcy, megacorps buy up all the assets and replace the workers with AI-run robots and let all of the suddenly extraneous lower and lower-middle class folks kill each other and starve to death.  \n\n  \nThen there is less competition for resources, less needs to be allocated to the filthy poors, and there is no drop in goods and services thanks to the robots.  More money for a trip to Mars by the way.  \n\n  \nLogically, if most menial jobs will soon be replaced by AI and robotics, there are only two options for the displaced worker class.  Provide a Universal Basic Income, or let them die.  Which option do you think will appeal to the current administration?  If many people \"commit the sin of empathy\" then this whole plan falls apart, hence the foundational groundwork being laid here.",

These are not the same thing and the terms are not interchangeable.\n\nSerial killers have supreme empathy but zero to negative sympathy. They use their keen understanding of the thoughts and feelings of others (ie empathy) to prey upon them more effectively, but they are either indifferent to or *enjoy* the suffering of their victims (ie no sympathy.) Ted Bundy, for instance, would pretend to be injured so that women would approach to help him.\n\nThe **SIN OF EMPATHY** refers to supposedly unethical actions taken under the guise of empathy or sympathy. For instance, forcibly shaving everyone bald so that cancer patients do not feel excluded for losing their hair.\n\nThe problem is that political puppets, presuming whatever they do not like is objectively unethical, pretend that empathy = sympathy = sin of empathy. And rather than set the record straight, social media warriors instantly concede this grand delusion, and strut around with their hands on their hips irrelevantly boasting about how they're committing the sin of empathy, because smugly cawing stupid things that have no bearing in reality is all social media is able to do.\n\nThe entire \"debate\" is founded on poor comprehension, conceit, and objective falsehood, and should be shown away at the door. When speaking of adult topics we should not seek wisdom from children.",

A balanced approach is ultimately what should always be the goal on any matter or solution to a problem.\n\nToo much order is tyranny. Too much chaos is anarchy. Neither is good. But a balance of the 2 is.  A balance doesn\u2019t automatically mean 50/50. Balance is circumstantial to any current situation its needs. So 70/30 or 40/60 could be the ideal balance between 2 opposing forces.\n\nToo much empathy has lead to some obnoxious problems in society over the past decade or so.  PC culture, death of comedy, lower quality entertainment (in the west), cancel culture, gender wars, extreme division in politics, etc.  \n\nThere has been a serious imbalance and overabundance of empathy to the point where it\u2019s been weaponized and used by corporations, media outlets, politicians, influencers especially, and many more for personal gain far more than for actual good.\n\nIt\u2019s literally the same logic that was used during the Crusades where something supposedly good like spreading civilization and Christian values was used for personal gain and subjugation of others under the guise that there action were sanctioned by a god.  Empathy is just that god this time. \n\nI came to the conclusion that there was too much empathy in our society to the point where it was doing more bad than good a couple of years ago. I\u2019ve spoken with a few friends and my parents about this subject. Gotten quite a bit of push back, and probably will here too. But everyone learns sooner or later than balance is the key to most things. Doesn\u2019t matter how we feel about an opposing concept or approach to something. Balance is usually still the ideal goal that appeals to all aspects of a problem or desire or whatever.\n\nToo much empathy is just as problematic as too much of any other approach to the problems of our society today.  Attack or downvote me all y\u2019all want for saying this.  If I cared I wouldn\u2019t have posted this comment.",

Most people use SYMPATHY as a weapon. Most people try to act on behalf of others because they THINK they have empathy for them. Please recognize the difference. Lack of empathy is Sociopathy.

But it\u2019s been justified because of empathy or counterfeit empathy or whatever you\u2019d want to call it.\n\nJust like how the Crusades didn\u2019t portray or spread real Christian values.  But they said they did and history looks poorly on Christianity as a result, despite the lack of Christian values there.\n\nEmpathy is the intent behind much of what I described. Even if empathy isn\u2019t what\u2019s been exercised throughout all of those things.\n\nBut I actually think empathy has been very present. I believe it\u2019s why so much of society and the common public have bought into and given so much power and authority to most of the nonsense. Lots of bad or ineffective things happen despite good intentions.  People with agendas and power have just taken advantage of the empathy present.\n\nIt\u2019s the same reason why powerful world leaders like Hilter have been able to come into power through the vote of the people. A large build up of mutually shared sentiments becomes a tool that can be tapped into, used to unite a people for common objectives. For good or for bad, or more often something in between. It\u2019s the same reason why someone like Trump was able to win the popular vote. He took advantage of a common sentiment of dissatisfaction with the government mingled with the promise of \u201cchange\u201d.  Whether those changes will be good or not is another discussion. But changes are being made and we\u2019ll get to experience the positive and/or negative repercussions in the coming future.\n\nEmpathetic intent has been weaponized over the past many years to the negative consequence of many, despite some of the good that may have also come.  I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll experience some similar things with the desire for \u201cchange\u201d being implemented in the government.  Hopefully more good than bad, but that\u2019s ultimately unlikely given the track record of history where these uniting sentiments always get taken too far. We\u2019ll have to wait and see with time.",
