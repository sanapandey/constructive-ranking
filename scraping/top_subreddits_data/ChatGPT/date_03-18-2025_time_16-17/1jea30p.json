Just in China, the CEOs found to grievously threaten health and safety can occasionally be put in prison or executed, something that would never happen in America. Regardless, looking at reality in the present year is pretty bleak. America continues to rely on its treats economy to postpone dissent.

How would someone against capitalism buy anything, why does it matter if it\u2019s Amazon vs any other capitalist company? This is clearly made by someone who knows nothing and has never thought about politics, and they think they\u2019re doing a sick burn on people\u2019s hypocrisy. It\u2019s embarrassingly stupid juvenile garbage.\n\nI will give them the \u201cempower women\u201d one because it (may be) getting at a different point, which is embracing representational wins for elites (more women CEOs or best picture nominees or whatever) while they embrace disempowering women that aren\u2019t elites in businesses they own or work with, and as elites have no need to own or work with or interact with.
