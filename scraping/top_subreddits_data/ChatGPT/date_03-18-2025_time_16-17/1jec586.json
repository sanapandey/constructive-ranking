    "selftext": "And I can\u2019t even code\u2026\n\nA friend told me about something called email tagging. I had never heard of it. But here\u2019s the idea:\nWhen you use Gmail, you can insert a \u201c+\u201d in your address to track where you\u2019ve entered it.\n\nExample: Let\u2019s say your email is myname@gmail.com.\nYou sign up on Google and use: myname+google001@gmail.com.\n\nNow, if you suddenly get spammed and the email was sent to myname+google001@gmail.com, you instantly know who sold your address. No guessing. Just facts.\n\nI asked my friend if there\u2019s an app for that \u2013 something automated. Nope.\nSo I turned to ChatGPT and said: \u201cHey, can we build something to generate these emails automatically and keep track of where I\u2019ve used them?\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s response?\n\u201cSure, let\u2019s build a Chrome Extension.\u201d\nAuto-fill feature. Unique email tagging.\nAnd a history log that shows where and when I used each address.\n\nExport it? Of course.\nNow I can trace exactly who\u2019s trustworthy \u2013 and who\u2019s not.\n\nWhat can I do with this info? No clue.\nBut at least I finally know who\u2019s spamming me.\n\nP.S. Slightly evil thought:\nImagine a public database that exposes all the companies who\u2019ve sold your email.\n\nJust saying\u2026\n\n++++++++++++ Edit ++++++++++++\n\nChatGPT gave me list of ideas: \n\nWhat else can you use email tagging for?\n\nTurns out it\u2019s more powerful than just catching spammers:\n\n\u2022 Identify spammers\nFind out exactly who\u2019s selling or sharing your email. No more guessing.\n\n\u2022 Organize your inbox like a pro\nUse tags like +newsletter, +shop, +career to auto-sort your emails.\n\n\u2022 Create unlimited emails with ONE address\nPerfect for trials, tool testing, and sign-ups without needing new accounts.\n\n\u2022 Bypass \u201cone account per person\u201d restrictions\nSome platforms limit you \u2013 now you don\u2019t have to care.\n\n\u2022 A/B testing your own stuff\nSend emails to +versionA and +versionB to see what works best.\n\n\u2022 Debug forgotten accounts\nSee where your password reset emails are actually coming from.\n\n\u2022 Avoid fake email detectors\nTagged emails still look legit \u2013 way better than using temp-mail.\n\n\u2022 Drop Easter eggs for shady sites\nTry myname+yourespammingme@gmail.com. Just for fun.\n\n\u2022 DIY CRM\nNo expensive tools \u2013 your inbox becomes your personal tracker.\n\n\u2022 Catch-all emails without owning a domain\nUnlimited variations, all going to the same inbox.\n\n++++++++++++ Question ++++++++++++\n\nWould like to publish it for free (forever). \nWould you use it?\nCould I still monetize it?\nIt\u2018s finished and ready to use.

However, it\u2019s important to understand the correct syntax and limitations of these modifications.\n\n\n\n**Using the Plus Symbol for Aliases:**\n\n\n\nYou can create variations of your email address by adding a plus sign (+) followed by additional text before the u/gmail.com domain. For example, if your email is [myname@gmail.com](mailto:myname@gmail.com), you can use:\n\n\u2022 [myname+newsletters@gmail.com](mailto:myname+newsletters@gmail.com)\n\n\u2022 [myname+work@gmail.com](mailto:myname+work@gmail.com)\n\n\n\nEmails sent to these addresses will still arrive in your primary inbox.
