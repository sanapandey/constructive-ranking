In order to test accuracy I have performed various tests of asking ChatGPT and Claude basic questions that clients might want answers to or that you might need to know the answer to before deciding on a prosecution strategy, for example what is the deadline for performing various procedural actions for a patent application in a particular country. A worryingly high percentage of the time it gives an answer that is incorrect, even is response to a basic procedural question that a first year trainee should be able to answer accurately. LLMs are extremely good at doing various other things such as preparing summaries of particular documents, but they do not yet seem to be very good at providing factually accurate answers to specific questions, at least in the field that I work in.",
