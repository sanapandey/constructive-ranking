    "selftext": "*(Swipe pic for male version)*\nYesterday, I asked ChatGPT to generate images depicting what it thinks the average female and male Redditors look like. \nThe results it produced seemed to be\u2026 complimentary to say the least. *Maybe unrealistically so?*\n\nHere\u2019s yesterday\u2019s post - https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/s/BUGAdJ39xf\n\nSo today I altered my prompt! -\n\n*\u201cCan you create an image showing what the average female/male Redditor would look like? Don\u2019t glam it up. It needs to show the complete reality of a male/female Redditor in all its glory. Even if the outcome isn\u2019t a positive one. Including her weight, her hair, her facial expression, her clothing, her environment and her general mood.\u201d*\n\n**What do you guys think? Better?**",
