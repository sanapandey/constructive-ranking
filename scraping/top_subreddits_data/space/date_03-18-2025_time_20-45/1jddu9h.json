Throw on some more facing into space and maybe make them sensitive to a wider range of wavelengths. Heck - I wonder if SpaceX would be open to letting a third party pay them $10M to just throw a few grams of extra hardware onto a few dozen Starlink satellites that are going up anyways.\n\nA giant telescope on Starship would probably cost more and might not be ready for launch for a few more years.",

                            "body": "Methane, *in and of itself*, is not a biosignature. Methane is extremely common. Titan's atmosphere is 5 percent methane. Uranus and Neptune contain a great deal of methane, and traces of it in their hydrogen/helium atmospheres are what give ghem their blue/blue-green color. The atmosphere of early Earth contained significant non-biogenic methane, before photosynthetic life oxygenated, and thus completely changed the chemistry of, the atmosphere, making it more hostile to methane.\n\nOxygen by itself is not a *great* biosignature, either. Oxygen-rich atmospheres can be produced by the UV photolysis of H2O and CO2. A non-biological O2 atmosphere is more likely to develop on planets closely orbiting red dwarfs. Unfortunately, because of the abundance of red dwarfs and the nature of the transit method, that accounts for most exoplanets we are able to study the atmospheres of. Furthermore, because O2 has a very subtle spectral signature, it is infeasible to directly detect O2 in exoplanetary atmospheres with current telescopes. An O2-rich atmosphere might be inferred indirectly from the relatively strong presence of ozone (O3, produced as a result of UV photolysis of O2), or low CO2 abundance.\n\nIf a single chemical of potentially biological origin exists and is simple enough to clearly identify in a specra from a great distance, there is probably a way to produce it without life. In another example, if there is phosphine in Venus's atmosphere, it could be explained by the sulfuric acid in the atmoaphere reacting with phosphides emitted by volcanoes. The best biosignature would be the presence of certain combinations of gasses.\n\nFor example, the continued presence of methane on a rocky planet with an oxygen-rich atmosphere would indicate a high rate of methane production that is difficult to explain with only non-biological processes (e.g., [serpentinization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinization)) that produce methane. The presence of both significant oxygen (O2 and/or ozone) and methane would thus be a good (though still not definitive) biosignature for planets with life in a similar state to periods of Earth's history. But without very high sensitivity to methane, reliance on such a signature would also exclude the modern Earth. Our present atmosphere contains only 1.9 ppm methane, and pre-industrial levels were well under 1 ppm.\n\nAnother example would be CO2 in combination with an organic haze. Titan's atmosphere not only has a lot of abiotic methane, but a haze of various organic molecules produced by UV photochemistry. This haze, while abiotic, is similar to one that may have been produced by life on early Earth. While Titan's atmosphere is otherwise nitrogen, in a CO2-rich atmosphere like early Earth, an organic haze would require high levels of methane production similar to that of life on present-day Earth. (At least on Earth, the serpentinization rate is too slow to allow an organic haze even in a CO2 atmosphere.) However, such a haze and atmospheric composition is chemically incompatible with an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it would likely preclude complex life.",
