Then, when the cold comes around and the CCA(cold cranking amps) is much more critical, it suffers when cranking due to not having enough CCA. Therefore, its the winter when the problem becomes actualized, and so we associate a direct cause and effect even though it's usually a little more nuanced.",

With the expansion and contraction over a huge temperature range it can break solder joints, it can also potentially encourage production of tin whiskers which create new unwanted electrical connections that cause shorting. Batteries are another possible failure mode, which can be worked around but it requires designing for it. Some materials lose a lot of integrity when cooled to near cryogenic temperatures, so they can shatter or fall apart.\n\nSeveral landers that weren't specifically designed to survive lunar night have managed to wake up successfully but typically there's a luck factor that just runs out eventually. It is possible to design electronics that can survive such temperature extremes but it's very expensive to do so and it's generally easier to design systems which keep the electronics warm over the two week night.",
