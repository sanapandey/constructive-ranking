Anti-anxiety meds can AND WILL kill you if you try to cut them cold turkey.\n\nLets not downplay the damage xanax and other anti-anxiety medications have caused to our society just because the opioid epidemic was and still is, so in our faces.\n\nEdit: All the people that downvoted me don't know the difference between psych meds that are meant specifically for anxiety and psych meds that can be prescribed for anxiety. Benzo's are specifically prescribed for anxiety only for psychological issues. All other \"anti-anxiety meds\" are SSRI's, anti-psychotics, etc which are not *specifically* for anxiety.",

When she was in TK, I walked in to her school office for the first time to check her out for something (I forget what, maybe a doctor's appointment).  They did not ask my name, they looked at me, told me (Insert daughter's name here) was about to get out for lunch, and to just sign her out.  I had attended back to school night, but these were office staff, not the teachers, and this was the first time they had met me in person.  My daughter has the same hair color,  hair thickness/wave, facial structure, similar body build, and eye color.  My brother, when he saw her in person for the first time in about a year after covid, did a literal double take because of how much she looked like me.  \n\n  \nAs she gets older, the effect is wearing off a bit, but its still there.",

He argued that he was entitled to make Asian jokes because of his relationship with Song, and because of his future fatherhood to multiracial children, stating that he would \u201cunderstand the struggle\u201d.\n\nFrom Wiki. Anyone want to take a guess if Macaulay still feels that way?",
