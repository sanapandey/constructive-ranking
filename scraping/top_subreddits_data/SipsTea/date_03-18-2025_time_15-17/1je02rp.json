I'm sure I'm not the only one on here who has had to deal with it in real life but it's extremely insulting and idiotic to just label people such things when it's a very hard diagnosis in the first place. My parents only got diagnosed due to being so horrendously abusive towards myself and my sister that they had to see court ordered psychiatrists/psychologists for psych evaluations. \n\n\nSo next time you want to call someone a narcissist just remember there's a difference between acting on narcissistic traits vs actually having NPD. Sorry this one and gaslighting bothers me because it's just ignorance at its finest and causes confusion to everyone",

Sima Yi's precarious situation could also have been known by zhuge Liang and could have been an exploit made by him and if it was any other general he would have had not worked so I do agree with you on the politics part as it was almost definitely made as a propaganda move as this was during a period of troubles so it would be good to use this event as a way to convince the people that they were under a great leader possibly exaggerating it so it could have happened just not at that scale",

Because once he defeated zhuge liang the cao family would execute him as he is seen as too much of a threat. \n\nIn the novel it's portrayed that he was too paranoid of zhuge liang's genius because the novel is heavily, heavily biased towards kingdom of shu. Thus he didn't attack. \n\nEither way ur kinda right. He didn't want to lose his asset. In the first case it was his value as Wei's counter to zhuge liang, in the second it's his troops.\n\nBut trust me, he does not care about the lives of his soldiers.",
