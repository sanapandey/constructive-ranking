I asked for her phone so I could watch YouTube (I had a flip phone still at the time).\n\n\nThen, I carefully got her credit card out and took a picture of it, front and back.. and sent it to myself.\n\n\nThen I deleted the messages on her phone so she'd never know.\n\n\nI used that card on Steam for months, racking up a total of $400 until i got caught.  I spent the next 3 summers paying it off by mowing the neighbors lawns.",
