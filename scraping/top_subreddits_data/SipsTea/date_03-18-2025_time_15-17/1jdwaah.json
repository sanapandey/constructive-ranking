It's either still dark in the morning or no one notices it because it's light when they leave in the morning. \n\nAnd possibly somebody forgot to turn it on at night. Maybe they came home and it was still light out and it didn't occur to them to turn it on for other people. \n\nI don't think these are people who want two different things. It's highly unlikely the first woman is saying they want no light ever. It's equally unlikely that the woman in the dark is the  one who has figured out that a light is sometimes needed.\n\nThis is just editing and some sexist inference. I think it would be foolish to believe that these people can't make up their minds about whether or not they want light in the dark.\n\n A motion light would be helpful though.",
