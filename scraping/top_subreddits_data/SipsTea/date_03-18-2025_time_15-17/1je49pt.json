Better ways we can work on it - not have the faucet running when not needed, don't water your yard as little as possible, don't do grass lawns go natural or mostly natural with local drought resistant plants. And of course force the rich to stop building golf courses and stop growing crops in places crops shouldn't be grown and stop growing some crops that require such huge amounts of water. Etc. Etc.",

It rarely goes below -25C here so I haven't really had to figure out a plan B for something like -30C or -40 or something wild.

The shower removes the odor, and the deodorant helps keep it away for much longer.\n\nI find that shaving or at least trimming the hair can help too. Sometimes it's the hair that stinks, not the pits themselves, and it's much harder to get rid of the smell if that's the case. I don't like shaving completely because it gets itchy, but if I notice it's particularly hard to get rid of the smell, I'll trim it a bit.\n\nEdit: Could it be possible that after showering you're clean and smelling good, and it's not that your armpits start smelling worse shortly after, but rather that your nose gets used to the fresh post-shower scent, and when your regular body odor sets in again, it takes a while for you to adjust?",

Just because you don't shower everyday it doesn't mean you're not hygienic!",

Once he retired, he might shower once a month.\n\nI have never known him to 'stink', but he has a natural odor about him that ive come to be used to. He does wash his clothes religiously and is a smoker. He smells more like cigarette smoke than BO. And we live in the south, hot and humid and when he sweats, it looks like he just got out of a rain storm. He has to peel his jeans off, thats how sweaty he gets. The worst thing ive seen with him is his hair growing mold like Beetlejuice, which is what he uses as a marker to finally shower. He always feels better after a shower but he just cant be bothered for some reason. But he did grow up when you'd only bathe twice a week, for church Wednesday and Sundays, because running water wasnt a thing for him growing up. Hed only shower on Fridays becuase he was a weekend warrior and knew women wouldnt be cool with him not bathing.\n\nAll that being said, when i was depressed at one point i tried to live that similar lifestyle. After about 3-4 days, i start getting a funk that id enjoy if i didnt know how rank it was. I stink therefore i am kinda scenario, but i know nobody else would appreciate it. And in that time i only wore deodorant if i was going out, so it wasnt some sort of chemical reaction as i wasnt going anywhere, didnt have a job etc.. I get, at most, 3 days before i start to get a funk. Donno if its genetic differences, dietary differences, or what. I, at the very least, rinse off for 1-5 minutes every day even if i dont use soap just to get that 'slime' off of me that builds up in my cracks and crevices. Granted, when i was depressed i would, to prevent showering if i was going out, hand wash my cracks and crevices with water and a wash cloth. No soap.\n\nDonno if its a genetic difference or what, but for two people who share genetics we have wildly different funks.",

That situation might be different for a place like Europe, which experiences harsh winters, that makes things like personal hygiene bit more difficult, prior to modern invention. \n\nPresent day, I do not shower every single day nor twice a day, and clearly I\u2019m not dying from minor infections, nor is my personal hygiene ever lacking. If your body requires you to bathe every day and night, then you do what you have to do to stay clean and not offend the noses of those around you.

The bottom of my feet & palm of my hands developed a severe red blistering & itched very badly. I hardly slept because the itching was so bad.

Reality is that people do have different \"rates\" of BO, sweat production, etc, and they also need different products. Sometimes it's trial and error to find them and the right rate of showering.\n\nFor instance, I personally know I can wash my hair every 2-3 days before it starts getting oily because I figured it out. I washed my hair every day, and then every other day, and then once a week. Once tried to do a no-wash type of thing. It just didn't work for me. I'm not waiting months to \"reset\" my hair. I've accepted that we live in the 21st century and I like my hair 21st century clean. For me, that's 2-3 days.\n\nAll these people who do things like not wear deodorant and they still stink, yeah, they're not doing something right. They're just believing shit they read/heard and not actually putting any effort in.",

Even a thin layer of sweat, dead skin, and grime will transfer to your bed and build up over time. You\u2019ll end up sleeping in sheets filled with accumulated sweat and dirt, which will then transfer back onto your body. That\u2019s why we shower once in the morning and again before bed.

The skin is more or less designed to keep itself somewhat clean, if allowed, but there are always reasons you may WANT to take a shower.\n\nIf you are highly active, highly sweaty, have a dirty job, or live somewhere humid... You probably need to shower more often. An as needed shower isn't a bad thing, but daily showering very well could be.",

The people who experience eczema like symptoms are usually causing it themselves by showering too often.\n\nYour scalp and rest of your body needs to produce these oils to hydrate the skin.\n\nHowever, what do people do when they shower daily? Remove these natural oils constantly. Then they replenish them with artificial oils via store bought cremes and other nonsense.\n\nSo effectively you are removing your body oils to replace them with company produced products. Yep that's what they want you to do and think.\n\nThis doesn't mean you will smell like shit. I didn't say to not wash your ass or pits. I am saying don't power wash your body daily it's not good for skin health.\n\nThere are exceptions to this clearly. If you are a manual laborer none of this applies to you. If you are an office worker chances are you don't need to shower daily it's pointless. Especially if you stay indoors in an temperature controlled environment.\n\nUse a bidet, wash your arm pits as needed. Baby wipe your genitals post work out to take away sweat and build up.\n\nI shower once to twice a week at most and it has helped me tremendously with skin and scalp issues. Also I live in Florida where it is disgusting outside, but I am not usually out there.\n\nJust sharing my side of things, not a crusade, not a hill to die on, not telling anyone they have to do anything.",

Intense sweaty workouts have never been an issue either. If anything those are the days I get more compliments; if your crevices are clean I don't think the sweat that re-absorbs into the rest of your body is necessarily an issue for some, if there is an odor it's so faint and might even be pleasant to some people. But I do mostly hang out with mentally ill introvert alt goblins so who knows if your mileage will vary with people's opinions on your hygiene.

He tells me that some of his fellow countrymen aren't used to showering every day because it's not necessary over there.  They assume it's the same here, but it's not. (He also thinks that deodorants over there aren't as effective as the ones here, but I can't confirm that.) Because of the climate, no matter how much deodorant you use, you'll end up sweating by the end of the day. People here are aware of that, so it's customary to shower once or even twice a day.",

Washing and scrubbing removes these, especially if the water is hot. As a result:\n\nSkin may become dry, irritated, or itchy.\nDry, cracked skin may allow bacteria and allergens to breach the barrier skin is supposed to provide, allowing skin infections and allergic reactions to occur.\nAntibacterial soaps can actually kill off normal bacteria. This upsets the balance of microorganisms on the skin and encourages the emergence of hardier, less friendly organisms that are more resistant to antibiotics.\nOur immune systems need a certain amount of stimulation by normal microorganisms, dirt, and other environmental exposures in order to create protective antibodies and \u201eimmune memory.\u201c This is one reason why some pediatricians and dermatologists recommend against daily baths for kids. Frequent baths or showers throughout a lifetime may reduce the ability of the immune system to do its job.\nAnd there could be other reasons to lose your enthusiasm for the daily shower: the water with which we clean ourselves may contain salts, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, pesticides, and other chemicals. It\u2019s possible these may cause problems, too.\n\nThe case for showering less\n\nOvercleaning your body is probably not a compelling health issue. Yes, you could be making your skin drier than it would be with less frequent showering. This is not a public health menace. However, daily showers do not improve your health, could cause skin problems or other health issues \u2014 and, importantly, they waste a lot of water. Also, the oils, perfumes, and other additives in shampoos, conditioners, and soaps may cause problems of their own, such as allergic reactions (not to mention their cost).",

NO your skin doesn't get dry. NO your hair will NOT fall off. NO you will NOT get acne from showering. YES we use SOAP and DEODORANT EVERY DAY.\n\nThere are jokes amongst ourselves about how much europeans smell. How taking the metro in Paris is worse than diving in a dumpster. Every visitng european I met SMELLED BAD (the ones that live here quickly learn that there is no harm in keeping yourself clean).\n\nCleaning yourself will NOT KILL YOU\n\nAgain, we're 200 million people showering MINIMUM once  day. Every one is healthy. Everyone smells clean. People love to sexualize brazilians and talk about how healthy and beautiful we are, maybe take a look on what we're doing?\n\nsorry about the rant, I'm ready for the downvotes lol\n\nedit: [Bathing Habits by Country 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bathing-habits-by-country)",

Performative is definitely not the right word, even in quotations. \n\nThe human body has mechanisms to keep itself clean and needs minimal assistance. The \"problem,\" is that minimal assistance for one person might be showering once a week, and for another, twice or more a day.\n\nMyself, I'm a once a week, and a \"dry bath\" every other day kind of minimal. For the longest time, I was showering once or twice a day, and my skin was drying out and getting to the point I thought I had eczema. Even with a bunch of lotions and treatments \n\nTurns out I was literally stripping away the natural barrier of oil and dermis that would otherwise be fine. I don't produce a lot of oil, and my skin is on the slow side of replacing itself. \n\nOnce I dialed back on the daily showering, and switched to dry bathing (scrubbing down with a stiff cloth and hot water), things got better inside of a week, and I was back to normal inside of a month.\n\nNo weird smells, no acne, just clean skin.\n\nSoaps and shampoos are not a natural part of our body dynamics, and while they can be helpful, there are definitely thresholds where they do more harm.\n\nIt's New York Post, so I'm not going to look up the article, but if it was intent on being genuine, I imagine it'd be saying much of the same thing",

Most body washes will clean dirty and grim off, but they doesn't necessarily have antibacterial in them. Which it's the antibacterial that kills the smell. So for people who still smell or smell quickly after just taking a shower, switch to an antibacterial soap like dial bar soap.  \n\nIf you have a strong smell or body acne etc use chlorhexidine gluconate 4% such as hibiclens, tho I prefer the CVS store brand that comes in a 18oz foaming bottle. Also the chlorhexidine gluconate continues to work after the shower. That's why if you ever had surgery they give you a small bottle of it and tell you to shower the night before the surgery with this soap because it inhibits bacterial grow for 24 hours after using it.  \n\nYou scrub it on your armpits, groin, fat rolls etc, let it sit for 3- 5 minutes, THIS IS KEY you HAVE to let it stay on the area for at least 3 minutes, then rinse it off. Don't put anything on after, no lotion, no deodorant, no sprays, nothing. I can shower in the morning and use it. Not put deodorant on, then spend 4 hours out in the Texas heat doing yard work or whatever without smelling. Sure I sweat but I don't smell.

Why, and about what?\n\nHere, let's expand their reasoning:\n\n>Well, you see, these \"experts\" just think they're so smart, but they're so out of touch and inhuman as to waste money and time on something as simple as \"are showers good\". Yet another example of how experts shouldn't be trusted - and how science isn't practical and doesn't help with *real world* problems.\n\nThe headline practically *begs* for the exact response we're all now seeing and commenting on, to the same effect as above:\n\n>The health benefit is so you don't smell like shit, hope this helps\n\nAs you can see, the engagement something like this gets is off the charts. It makes you feel smart for being smarter than an \"expert\", and makes them seem dumb.\n\nWhy would this be the goal? Well, this is just one tiny piece of a larger agenda. These pesky experts talk about more than showers. They're talking about climate change, negative effects of social media (especially as a propaganda outlet), the rise of fascism, the wealth gap, etc. All things that are fought vehemently in the information war we're in. If they're talking about all of that and are insisting that showers aren't beneficial, then maybe the other things are bullshit too!\n\nNow, of course, what really is happening is a trick. \"Performative\" in common parlance usually conflates with \"unnecessary\". However, here, \"performative\" basically just means *social* as opposed to *biological*. Experts aren't saying \"showers are unnecessary\" they're saying \"we thought there may be more than a social function, but we've yet to find one\". This is the worst kind of correct - *technically* correct, but seemingly violating common sense. Ripe for propaganda - just enough meat to not be strictly *disinformation*, falls right into the *misinformation* warping and twisting the truth to change your mind.\n\nHopefully this exercise helps you to spot things like this in the future, it's really important to resist propaganda to keep ones mind sharp and clear in this trepidacious media landscape.\n\nAlso, just simply never trust the New York Post, it's really propaganda all the way down for them.",

Getting rid of oil or dead skin, or anything like that, or \"surface germs\", all that crap and justification for showering excessively is just bonkers, complete nonsense. All of that is just personal preference or your own body. \n\nAs for hair, I for one am really weird and can not wash my hair for weeks and I barely produce any sebum/oil, I think that might be a sign of Sjogren's or some automimmune lmao as i'm in my twenties, not elderly with extremely dry/thin hair. But regardless, most other women I know go between 2-7 days without washing their hair. Or they might use \"no-poo/low-poo\" shampoos and no silicone conditioners, and go a few weeks in between proper/full shampoo applications (but they do \"wash\" it with water or low-poo shampoos more often then that).\n\nSo we've eliminated the hair variable here, so why do people shower once vs twice a day, vs every couple of days, etc?\n\nShowering/bathing is primarily for odor reduction. And some people smell more than others. These are just facts. Some extremely sweaty, usually guys, doing any sort of physical labor or going to the gym, NEED to shower afterwards. Especially any high-intensity workout, it's practically mandatory to shower. Some people can get away with low-intensity physical labor not showering daily, but it REALLY depends on the person. If you are in an extremely humid climate, you likely feel like you need to shower way more often to get rid of the sweat stank. For those that are morbidly obese, odor/sweat/stink can be a big issue, and they need to shower more often. Or you LITERALLY have hyperhidrosis, and you just sweat more biologically than everyone else for no reason. We're all different.\n\nBut if, say you barely work out, you have a sedentary job, you don't sweat often or have drier skin than average, and you are gifted with more pleasant/subtle body odor for when you DO stink, you can go longer than others without showering.\n\nI do find a big difference though just between men and women though, i'm trans and when I transitioned hormonally, my body odor and oil production dropped off a cliff. Body odor changed to be \"different\", but also just inherently less potent. Sweat production dropped off across my whole body. It's GREAT. But it also turned my skin type from combination-oily skin to dry skin all over my body, which kind of sucks living in a desert.\n\nI just wish there was less of a stigma or that society was less dogmatic about it, that even though there are plenty that DON'T shower daily, it's kind of the expectation of a one size fits all daily shower for everyone on earth lmao. So if hygiene is ever brought up in conversation, which isn't really much, I usually just lie about showering daily or go along with the group consensus.\n\nI do encourage tits, pits and \\*\\*s cleaning if you don't want to take a full shower after you've noticed any odor. I found out about benzoyl peroxide from a dermatologist on Youtube, and apparently she uses it as a \"body wash\" replacement for odor areas (not the sensitive areas though, just pits, tits, and NOT the nether regions) rather than the acne treatment benzoyl peroxide is usually used for. It basically completely annihilates bacteria/odor after you leave it on a patch of skin for a few minutes. Really nice if you notice your pits smelling but don't have time for a shower, you don't even need to get in the shower, I just put in on the pits, let sit, wipe off with wet rag.",
