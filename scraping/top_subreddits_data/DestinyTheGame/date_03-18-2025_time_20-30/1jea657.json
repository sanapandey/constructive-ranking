If you want to complete it this week, you have 3 full days to do it.\n\nAfter that, you either need to hope it rotates back into the cycle or Bungie auto completes it at the end of the season.  Do yourself a favor and play it now if you really want to knock out that challenge.",

Where a teammate runs in to dunk but dies, and I come in to clean up and dunk. Best you can do in that case is finish your challenge and genuinely help your team in that case by not picking the spark up again. But instead properly providing cover.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAn alternative way is to message everyone in the lobby to just trade pickups. Slow and unreliable, but it can work.",
