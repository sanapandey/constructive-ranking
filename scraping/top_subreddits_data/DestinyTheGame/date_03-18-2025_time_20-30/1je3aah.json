The absolute spam from Husks (because you have no option to take out large groups with crits only) absolutely obliterates you. Tormentors, well only the boss ones seem to be overkill; normal ones seem to be just fine. Subjugators have been the same amount of annoying and again really only an issue with the boss variants. Haven't had any notable issues with Attendants or Weavers, but they seem few in the Nether and Court compared to the other dread.",

Thankfully it seems to only appear during the Mausoleum boss fight and it's only two in pretty fixed spots. I didn't see any in the open areas or during other encounters with Taken in the Nether. All the Taken in the Nether seem to be extremely easier to deal with over their Dread equivalents.",

Frozen me because I spent too long in the lingering hitbox (except that one Taken Knight boss from the Season of the Lost 6-player activity before WQ, that guy was evil). Attendants freeze me at least every time I play Sundered Doctrine, and usually while I'm trying to kill them in a room with a Strand Subjugator or in the Husks room, or literally any time in final boss.
