Activate that to open a portal. Go thru that and yoink the right side chest. It should give you the heavy spine fragment (or whatever exotic mission thing). Take this back to slab to exchange for \"A hammers path\".\n\nStep 1 of it - must be rank 12 with path of ambition (and have all the tome upgrades)\n\nStep 2: complete expert nether with shotgun, dyad (and something else) equipped. [Unsure if it can be 1 encounter or it has to be all 3. Also unsure if we can damage with whatever and switch to required weapons as boss dies or that EVERY weapon damage instance must be done with one of the 3 required weapons]\n\nStep 3: get (xyz) caty. I'm still on step 1 of this so idk. A buddy of mine is on step 2 and we all want to catch up to him\n\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk",
