So you don\u2019t do it one at a time each week it rotates, you have access to do the GMs that will be in rotation for the future and previous weeks. Once you complete one though, you lose access to do it again unless it\u2019s the weekly rotator. Could \u201cCP\u201d farm by completing the strike with 2 ppl while the 3rd leaves to not complete to start again.",

If you did it in rotation last season, it would appear again this season. Pretty sure once you\u2019ve completed it, you can\u2019t select it to do it again.",
