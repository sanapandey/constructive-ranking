I\u2019m gonna be honest I\u2019ve given up on broodweaver getting any buffs, it\u2019s been two years and I\u2019m fine if broodweaver is only ever good when horde shuttle comes around. (Even though other classes can use horde shuttle and have the potency of broodweaver, but hey at least we\u2019re the only one\u2019s with a one off super!) \n\nthere was clearly no care put into this subclass, how is it the only subclass on warlock without a summoner when bungie made warlock the summoner identity? Why did broodweaver get a worse artifact mod (wanderer) a season after? Weavers call was just ass at launch and is still pretty meh. Mindspun was only used for its suspend and it got destroyed with suspend nerfs and thread of generation nerfs with the only build being grapple threadlings which is niche in itself. Weavewalk makes no sense for this subclass\u2026 when strand is all about high action, why did bungie make Weavewalk one of the most passive aspects in the game? The subclass design just makes no sense. I just want to know what happened while designing this subclass.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna even talk about the shit threadling and needlestorm tracking, and how threadlings basically require thread of evolution.",

It\u2019s always fine. Everything can\u2019t be arc this season, and I suspect next season it\u2019s going to feel way different as a power level. This is the cycle of the artifact.\n\nCould it be buffed? Sure. I think you could say that about Stasis and Void too, and arc when the artifact goes away. So that leaves Solar and prismatic as outliers, and why not reign those things in instead?",

And I do agree that the current subclass verb perks for strand are very weighted towards sever and we don't really need more of that.",

Hunter stasis super and warlock stasis super are kind of just bad, and even after bungie double the shatter damage, we also had last episode where you could increase shatter damage even more, and send out slowing projectiles, and that was like the only time Stasis really got used\n\nI'm not really sure what Bungie is going to do to get people to use stasis in general",

Instead it\u2019s used as a seasonal/episodic flavor-of-the-month sort of thing.\n\nIt also annoys me that they introduce Bolt Charge, then immediately buff it even further with mods. Once Heresy ends, it\u2019s not going to be as strong and feel as good to use. It also makes it harder to gauge if something is \u201coverpowered\u201d or not if it debuts with augments that make it stronger than it actually is.",

Make Lightfall free like Beyond Light.\n\nNew Super for either Strand/Stasis depending on the class, new Aspect depending on the class.\n\nStrand Titan feels great, maybe just give Flechette Storm a boost because it\u2019s a hard trade off to not have Banner. Into the Fray feels kinda mandatory. Drengr\u2019s is in a weird place where nothing really needs that much Suspend and if Suspend is good it\u2019s probably trivializing.\n\nI definitely feel like Stasis Titan needs more help than Strand Titan, Strand Warlock needs more help than Stasis Warlock but a new Super for Shadebinder is very desired, and I\u2019m split between Stasis Hunter and Strand Hunter.\n\nEven Prismatic needs some tuning in my eyes. Warlock and Hunter cannibalize the best parts of multiple other subclasses and Titan has one playstyle albeit an insane one.\n\nI\u2019d also love for the Artifacts to feel less like borrowed power. I\u2019m afraid once we lose the current artifact Arc Titan might go back to obscurity in PvE. Arc has felt like the red-headed step child in general so it\u2019s nice to see it in the limelight.\u00a0",

Maybe we\u2019ll get a strand equivalent to Destabilizing rounds that grants unraveling rounds instead, but that wouldn\u2019t do much for Broodweaver imo.\n\nWe have gotten Hoard Shuttle multiple times already, and every time we have asked Bungie to add it to Broodweaver, we have gotten nothing (not suprising considering how Bungie has responded to other Broodweaver criticisms). And honestly, considering the strength (or lack thereof) of the Broodweaver aspects, I doubt we\u2019d get the full strength of Hoard Shuttle.
