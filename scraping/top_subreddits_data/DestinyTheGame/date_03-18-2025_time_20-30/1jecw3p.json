    "selftext": "ATTENTION ALL STRONGHOLD PLAYERS!\n\nSeen and heard a lot about new stronghold players not tanking bosses effectively so here's a quick guide on how to lock down a boss for your team while also not being too passive!\n\nIf you didn't know standing next to a boss will cause it to do a melee stomp attack attempting to knock the player backwards so it can continue using its ranged attack. This is where sword block comes in with its COMPLETE IMMUNITY TO KNOCKBACK! Meaning you can \"lock down\" the boss into just spamming melee over and over and while the boss recovers from its melee attacks you can start dealing damage with your sword. Flash counter storms keep does a decent amount of damage but there are even more ways to provide value to your team than just holding block!\n\nVideo guide here: [https://youtu.be/POtXusPRa5E](https://youtu.be/POtXusPRa5E)\n\nIf you have any questions I'd love to answer them! I have around 900 hours with stronghold and love it to death!",

Rick Kackis for the sudden interest in using Stronghold, it was actually your videos that turned me on to how much fun it is to use these gauntlets.  I\u2019ve only used it in solo activities so far, but I\u2019m having a blast with it and the new flash counter sword.  Expert Court solo isn\u2019t too bad with this setup, although I\u2019ve only made it through five bosses solo so far.  Thanks for the videos and keep em coming.",
