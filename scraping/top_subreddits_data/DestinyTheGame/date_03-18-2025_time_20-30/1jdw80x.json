    "selftext": "I\u2019m hoping to draw some attention to this as from what I have found playing with other fireteam finder players the drops are far lower for adepts (much less shiny adepts) for act 2. Is there anything specific that can be done to boost the drop rates here on the players end or is it just really bad RNG? I have done at least 30 expert runs personally and have not got a single adept\u2026 whereas it was quite common in the nether. \n\nIm hoping this isn\u2019t intended and drawing some attention to it can get Bungie to see it. The shiny drops, totally understand them being rare, but adepts shouldn\u2019t be this bad imo compared to their drop rate in the nether activity. \n\nFeel free to share your experience in farming for these, like I said I haven\u2019t got a single adept personally.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the responses over night. It\u2019s been \u2026 interesting??? reading the various outcomes people have had since Act 2 dropped. Keep posting your experiences so that worst case scenario other players can have a realistic expectation of the drops for these, assuming that the drop rates don\u2019t change and are intentional. ",

If you drop to Gold, your NF weapon drop chance effectively (on the lower difficulties) goes to nil.\n\nHell, this week alone with double drops I got probably 6 or 7 sidearms for shy of a dozen or so runs between all my characters.
