It was rather eye opening seeing the gradient in quality when it comes to recycling weapon models throughout the game. While some are extremely obvious, you may find it pretty surprising that even some rather distinct models are just a recycle.  \n\nAlso hoping to contribute to the recycled weapon debate with this. Recycled weapons are a must to keep the loot flowing, so it helps to see what can be done with them and maybe adjust your expectations accordingly.",

            "body": "Honestly I think it's really cool! \n\nIt's just hard for me to get interested in new linear fusion rifles when 99% of them use the Veist model. Can we get a cassoid, hakke, or Suros LFR model?\n\nAlso my biggest issue is Trials weapons. It's technically not free to play, you have to own the most recent expansion in order to play trials, yet in my opinion it's the biggest offender of reskins/recolors.\n\nIf you look at raid or dungeon weapons, they either are unique, or heavily modified to where they better fit the theme of said raid or dungeon.\n\nThe last time we got a semi-unique looking Trials weapon was igneous hammer back in 2021. Yes that used a Suros HC model, but at least they tried to make it look a little more unique, and they gave it a unique firing sound. \n\nBut now at least for me, it's not exciting to get one new trials weapon per episode or season because it's just going to be a world drop weapon that's painted black and gold, that sounds exactly like the world drop weapon, but it just has juiced stats and juiced perks.\n\nI feel like, imo, in short, I wish that trials weapons got more artistic style in their models and in their firing sounds, bringing them in parity with raid and dungeon weapons.",

If you look at raids and dungeon guns over the years it becomes apparent when the reskin issue really started to get nasty (Hint: LIGHTFALL!). Not gonna get into seasonal guns, but just looking at all the major dlc weapons makes it pretty apparent when reskinning started to get really bad. Forsaken brought tons of new models, so did shadowkeep (which were reskinned in LF), so did beyond light, and so did witch queen. You could maybe argue the final shape guns are different enough to be reskins, but that's subjective at best. So no, reskinning hasn't really been a problem for the majority of D2's lifespan until now. Hell CoO and Warmind had more original models than lightfall and final shape did which is laughable to say the least.",

The grip is round and not rectangular. The frame lacks the sharp corners and fully encloses the back half of the blade. The distinct accent line is missing and instead the frame is partially hollowed out. It\u2019s not done in a superficial matter where you can see the seams and mentally separate them, but rather it is simply molded differently.  \n\nThere is a slight double standard as something so prominent as sharing an entire blade would normally be merged together, but hopefully my reasoning makes sense.",

            "body": "It's really cool to see this all laid out. Would have been helpful a few weeks ago when I was trying to figure out what model a gun I was looking at was based on, could have saved me some time. However, could you give a little more insight into your methodology for determining what goes together, as there are a few places where it's not clear why some weapons were grouped together despite major differences, and others where similar weapons were separated. I haven't had a chance to look closely at the whole document, but these are the things that seemed off to me:\n\n* LFRs: Threaded Needle/Doomed petitioner are quite different from the other \"Veist\" models. Even the parts that are similar - just the handguard, mag, trigger, and lower stock - are subtly different and not just a geometry copy like the other Veist guns. This is also inconsistent when compared to Trace Rifles, which are split into two categories despite sharing large swaths of identical geometry.\n* Cassoid Pulse Rifles: Definitely a shared lineage, but there are enough major but repeated variations that I think this could be broken down into at least 3 sub-families.\n* Hakke Pulse Rifles: Blast Furnace doesn't seem to belong with Hakke group - different barrel, shroud, body, stock, mag design, and mag insertion angle. Only notable similarity is the shape of the cut where the mag is inserted.\n* Cassoid Scout Rifles: Like the pulses, this is another that could use some separation, as there are shared aspects to all, but also repeating varations among the members.\n* Omolon Scout Rifles: I probably would have separated the 'open frame' and 'closed frame' variants into separate sub-families.\n* Cassiod A/Tex Hand Cannons: The distinction here is not clear. For example Fatebringer and Luna's Howl are in different categories, yet more similar to each other than many of the others they are classed with.\n* Cassoid/Crux Rockets: Hezen Vengeance feels more in line with the Crux/Lomar category. Notably it's lacking the distinct chunky flared barrel opening of the Cassoids, and shares some upper body and tail geometry with Cold Comfort.\n* Hakke/Bad Omens Rockets: These are clearly related, and should probably be one category. If kept as separate subfamilies, Crowning Duologue should be classed with Bad Omens as it's a near-copy geometry-wise, including the distinctive 'tail rings' at the back.\n\nAnyways, those are just my thoughts, and I would love to hear about how you decided some of these matters. Appreciate the hard work!",

One of the biggest complaints World got was that a lot of weapons were just the generic bone or ore weapons with monster bits glued onto them.  This was so unpopular that Capcom had to promise that Wilds wouldn't have it.  Why is that acceptable here?",
