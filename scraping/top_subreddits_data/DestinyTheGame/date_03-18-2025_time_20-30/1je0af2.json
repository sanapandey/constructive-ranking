    "selftext": "Not many people realize this, so I wanted to share. Several factors make this exotic **S-Tier**:\n\n* **Maligned Harvest Boost** \u2013 This is the big one. Not only does it give free weakening bursts, thanks to its new BOOST, every *hit* with a leeched weaken grants a new Void overshield: 70% damage reduction plus free HP! Insanely strong!\n* **No reloading** \u2013 One CO perks' states that obtaining devour *or a Void overshield* automatically reloads this weapon. Since every hit is giving you a Void overshield, you\u2019ll basically never have to reload!\n* **Volatile from Artifact** \u2013 We have several artifact perks that apply volatile, so a free source of volatile. This gives us more options, like running Orpheus Rig instead of Gyrfalcon\u2019s Hauberk for more supers.\n* **Fixed Tether Interaction** \u2013 Bungie finally fixed leeching suppression from tether supers. Since CO is an exotic primary, you\u2019ll get your super back fast. Pair it with a weakening suppression grenade and the volatile artifact mods, and you\u2019ll never run out of Void debuffs to leech.\n* **Anti-champion & Lightbearers** \u2013 Suppression lets you stun overload champions, and volatile lets you stun barrier champions. Suppression also makes targets disoriented and takes lightbearer (mini)bosses out of their supers! \n\nThis [setup](https://mobalytics.gg/destiny-2/profile/83276ebf-d818-45d6-b1e0-f12708edf073/builds/23dd7ab1-2999-4c76-97f3-4651f891412e) is seriously powerful! It reminds me of the Polaris Lance meta from back in the day. I think this may even be stronger.",
