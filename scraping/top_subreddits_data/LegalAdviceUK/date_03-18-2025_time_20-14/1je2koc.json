That day is unsuitable for me as I wish to be present, I have informed them of this, hoping to book a more convenient date. I have also offered to send photographs. They replied this morning and said they are allowed to use management keys to let themselves in if I cannot provide access (they said it is in the tenancy agreement I have not seen this) and will be doing so tomorrow.\n\nI was hoping for some advice - are they allowed to do this? What is the best way for me to respond in this situation?\n\nThank you so much for any advice, it is appreciated.",

If a landlord does enter the property without notice and permission, this is a violation of the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment - [https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/contents](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/contents)  \n  \nEven if your tenancy agreement includes a clause that allows them access, this should be really done at a time that is suitable to you and with your permission. Letting agents are unfortunately bad at pushing things like this for little or no reason.  \n  \nI'd send them a strongly worded reply, quoting the relevant legislation they'll breach if they enter the property and ask them to reschedule a date. You are a tenant, that means it's **your home** while you are in the tenancy agreement and you are entitled to your privacy.   \n  \nIf this is a routine property inspection, then I can't imagine why it would be so urgent that they cannot make it work at a time that is suitable to you. Most tenancies do include a clause that allows for inspections, so fair enough - but it's totally fair to insist this is done at a time that suits you. \n\nGood luck and sorry to hear you're having issues!",

They're just trying to bully you and assume you don't know your rights.\n\nYou have the right to quiet enjoyment of your home and part of that involves not wanting to have people in your home that you don't want there, wether you are present or not.\n\n>they said it is in the tenancy agreement\n\nIrrelevant. You cannot agree to sign away your statutory rights like this. Any clause that exists in a tenancy agreement (if you haven't seen it then have you even signed one) is completely unenforceable. Doubly so if you haven't seen one to sign it.\n\n>What is the best way for me to respond in this situation?\n\n\"I am exercising my right to quiet enjoyment of my home. As you well know, anybody entering the property in a non-emergency situation requires permission from the tenant in order to do so regardless of wether the appropriate notice has been given. It is also my right to refuse access for any and all future inspections. In the interest of maintaining a good working relationship with <agency name> I am, for now, willing to allow inspections only when the arrangements are agreeable with myself. I am not giving permission for anyone associated with <agency name> to enter the property at any time that is not first agreed with me. If I discover that access has been gained without my permission I will have no choice but to seek professional legal advice and will report <agency name> to the relevant local authority.\"\n\nNow go get your locks changed. Just change them back at the end of your tenancy. You are well within your rights to do this. \n\nIf you have an HMO the above will apply to your bedroom but not any communal areas of the property.",
