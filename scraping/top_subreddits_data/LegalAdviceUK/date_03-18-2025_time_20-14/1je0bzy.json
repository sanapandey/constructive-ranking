    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nThis is only a small amount of money - \u00a325 -but it's bothering me.\nSo I order 6 bags of groceries from Sainsbury's via justeat, to take advantage of some offers they have on there.\nA guy on a motorbike turns up with 4 bags and says the rest are \"coming later\" with another courier.  I also get an email from justeat confirming this. We are in all day but the second courier never arrives. \n\nI go into the app and check the boxes for all the food that wasn't delivered  - about 15 items. The app tells me that I will have to wait \"several days\" for them to investigate and they may decide not to return my money. \n\nI need that money to buy food for the week,  since Sainsbury's hasn't delivered it.\n\nI try to contact Justeat and Sainsbury's but there is no way of talk to a human being,  all their customer services are automated either phone or through the app. I reply to the email they sent me but there is no confirmation. \n\nIt feels wrong that they can keep my money for an indeterminate amount of time and not allow me to speak to a customer service agent about it. It's possible I might not get a refund at all. \n\nI probably won't ever use Justeat again,  just because the feeling of powerlessness is so unpleasant.  But in the event that they don't pay me back at all, what are my options? Taking them to small claims court over \u00a325 seems silly...\n\nUpdate: Thank you for your comments,  I told them I would just charge it back through my bank given evidence from my ring doorbell, and they replied quickly to credit my account.  I've now got my groceries (from coop) and I'm deleting the app, it's less stressful to get a taxi to the supermarket!",
