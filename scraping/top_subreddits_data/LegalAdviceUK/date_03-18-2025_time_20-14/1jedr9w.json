    "selftext": "my late grandmother made her will in 2009 leaving my sister and myself some money everything else to my mother but then later made amendments to the will stating her illegitimate son is to not receive anything upon her death. The solicitor has since closed, my grandmother has passed and the will has been lost. We have letters and receipts saying the solicitor will retain the will and amendments have been made and we have is a draft of the original will (pre-amendment) but no official document, so now my mother is legally obligated to split the estate with her half brother which goes against my grandmothers wishes. Do we have a case to fight this decision, will the receipts and draft copy be sufficient evidence to support our case?\n\n  \nedit: I forgot to add, the national will register have conducted a search and have come back with no results and my mum paid a will finding service to try and recover the will which has also come back with no results",

When was it lost?\n\nIt's possible for a copy of a will to be approved by the probate registry. Here, you've got a copy of the original will, but you don't say you've got any copies of the codicils. The evidence you've got may or may not be good enough for the court - I can't say.",
