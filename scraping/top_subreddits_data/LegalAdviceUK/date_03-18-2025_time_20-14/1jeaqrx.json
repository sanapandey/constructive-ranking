    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI recently rejected a \u00a324,000 used car within the 30 day short-term right to reject period to the finance company that I purchased the car with. The car was purchased from a Volvo main dealer and has since developed numerous faults some of which were discovered 8 hours into ownership. I'm not interested in accepting repairs as the repairs are totalling \u00a33000 and as the dealer is 5 hours away I was told I'd have to pay for these fixes and then seek re-imbursement from the dealer. \n\nI formally rejected the car to the finance company via email with a time line of events. I received no response, called them and they advised \"we have the email but this is nothing to do with us you have to reject with the dealer and they will unwind the agreement\" Citizens Advice advised they should absolutely be dealing with this.\n\nI then formally rejected the car to the dealer via email to the salesman, cc'd in the sales manager and the finance company stating reasons for rejection and I've had \\_zero\\_ response from them either. I've stopped using the car entirely.\n\nNo idea what to do here.",

Why would the finance company even have any involvement? \n\nThat's like me taking out a loan with Barclays to buy a car, rejecting the car and trying to get Barclays to handle the return/refund/whatever, all they're going to do is refer me back to whoever sold me the car. \n\nYour contract with the finance company is to repay them regularly, it has nothing to do with what you've actually spent your money on.",

Specifically Section 57 of CCA offers consumers protection by getting the finance company (or credit card company for that matter) to act on their behalf to recoup losses.",
