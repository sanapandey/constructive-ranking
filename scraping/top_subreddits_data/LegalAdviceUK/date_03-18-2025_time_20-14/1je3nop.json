    "selftext": "I recently checked my credit score just to see what it was like and noticed that it was extremely poor. I did some digging and found a CCJ dating back to 2019. After contacting certain people, I found out the name of the company that the debt is held with.\n\nTurns out it is a shop that my mum used to use all the time and I think she has made an account under my name and then not paid them back. I now have a CCJ on my credit for almost \u00a31300\n\nI have seen similar post about this and everyone says to either except and pay the CCJ (which I don't have the money to do) or to report my mum for fraud and get the CCJ removed.\n\nMy mum is a recoving alcoholic and I'm scared if I report the fraud then she'll fall back into her old patterns. My question is, if I do report my mum for fraud, what are the legal consequences she will face? I have read that she can get a criminal record, receive fines or even face time in prison. I DON'T want to send my mum to prison so what is the best option I have?",
