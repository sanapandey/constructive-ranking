    "selftext": "In June 2024 I ordered a pair of tyres online and was delivered the wrong type by the company. I spoke to them on the phone and they eventually sent the correct ones after about a month. \n\nThe agent on the phone said that the delivery driver would collect the incorrect ones at the time of delivery. When the replacements were delivered the driver had no collection instructions and thus the incorrect set were left with me. I queried the company I ordered them from about a return and heard nothing back. \n\nAs I live in a top floor flat, I was struggling for space to store these tyres, so in January of this year I sold them on FB Marketplace to make space.\n\n\nToday after just over 9 months with no contact from the seller in the preceding time I received an email with collection instructions for tomorrow. \n\nAs I've now disposed of the tyres I'd like to know what my rights are, if any, here as I can't seem to find an answer to my specific situation on the Citizens Advice site.\n\n\nI'm based in Scotland if it makes any difference.\n\nTIA.\n\n*Edit with additional context:*\n\nI sold the tyres for below new value (\u00a3100 vs \u00a3190)\n\nThe company I bought them from is based in the EU, specifically Germany.",

            "body": "Given the time of year, it's likely this is just them covering their bases before they process them as a write off loss. Even had you still held the tires, the value has depreciated given the unverifiable storage for 9 months (sit them next to a rad in direct sunlight that gets mildewy in winter for the better part of a year, and they may be less 'new' than when they came direct from dedicated storage, and that's before they assume you haven't been using them as a table to store your shuriken collection or some such which they can never promise to a future customer). Given that, the insurance payout and/or tax write-off is likely better than what they could resell the mystery-state product for. But they need to prove they tried to recover. The fact they just scheduled a collection, without even trying to contact you to ensure you'd be in, feels very much like they're just ticking off that checkbox and not expecting anything to actually come of it.\n\nContact them, explain the situation, and offer the proceeds of the FB sale. If it's a larger place, they'll likely not even bother about the cash and tell you to just refuse the collection (they want the evidence but not the more awkward paperwork of a partial claim); smaller business might take you up on it and appreciate saving funds by discontinuing the collection slot/getting some immediate cash while they wait on any insurance payout or reduction in tax bill to bear fruit. I would not panic, especially given the timing and lack of communication involved. At least not yet.",

Ideally you should have given them a deadline by which they had to collect and informed them that if the items weren't collected at that point you would dispose of them in the best way possible and pay them the proceeds, if any, of that disposal.\n\nAs you've sold the tyres you should inform them of that and send them the money you made from the sale (less costs). At the same time let them know that you contacted them to try and arrange collection but they didn't reply and so you sold the goods as, as is your right as an involuntary bailee, as you couldn't store them indefinitely.",

            "body": "When you were left with the tyres, you became an involuntary bailee. \n\nDid you try to contact the company again, after they failed to collect them the first time? Did you tell them what you planned to do with the tyres?\n\nThe proper way to deal with this situation would have been to inform the company you bought the tyres from that you would dispose of them by a certain date if they failed to collect. Then after that date you could sell them, or otherwise dispose of them - and you would then have a duty to send the net proceeds of any sale to the company (less your costs). \n\nUnfortunately, it seems like you might have skipped the step of notifying the company you planned to dispose of the tyres. So in theory the company could make a claim against you for the value of the tyres. \n\nHowever, I don't know how likely to succeed that would be, as you've acted pretty reasonably.\n\nThe best course of action now is to offer the amount you got when you sold the tyres to the company - and if that's a reasonable fraction of the cost of the original tyres, hopefully they will accept this and move on (probably after some grumbling). \n\n**You must give them that money though - legally, when you sold the tyres, the income from that belonged to the proper owner of the tyres.** \n\nIf they do accept this, make sure you get something in writing which shows they consider this closed.\n\nBut if they don't accept this, and threaten you with court, then you will have to decide whether it's worth gambling with going in front of a judge. \n\nDepending on the specifics (eg the difference in value for the cost of the tyres vs what you sold them for), I think there's a reasonable - not good, but reasonable - chance a judge might think the company is being unreasonable in not accepting the amount you would offer. \n\nOTOH, a judge might decide you should have chased them more, followed the rules, etc - and you'd be hit with the full bill, plus court fees. \n\nSo you might decide it would be better to settle. \n\nBut I would suggest you should not agree to pay any more than the original value of the tyres. The delay of nine months is on the company, and any costs they try to foist on you are there problem not yours.",
