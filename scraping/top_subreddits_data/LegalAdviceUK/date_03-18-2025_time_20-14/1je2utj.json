So, every 6 months we have a rental inspection and this is all fine but, this time I didn\u2019t see their notification that they were coming to the property as I was away when they sent it. \nIt wasn\u2019t till this morning when I was awoken by a man coming into my bedroom taking photos of my room that I had any idea about this. This was obviously terrifying at the time, I was alone in the house, naked under my covers, I had just woken up and there\u2019s a stranger in my room and I had no idea what was going on. \nI will add that where my bed is you can\u2019t see it straight away but once he had taken a picture he walked out, came back in, then realised I was there, said \u201coops\u201d under his breath and walked out. \nNormally no matter what they knock on each persons door to make sure they can enter but this guy didn\u2019t. Is this my fault because I didn\u2019t see the notification? If he had knocked before coming in my room I would have felt different, sorted myself out and allowed him to enter but I was left in a very vulnerable state.. (I am female) \n",

They will often take no reply to their notice of intention to inspect as permission to enter when they really shouldn't do.\n\nI would complain to the agency now. And make it very clear that in the future if you do not reply to their notice of intention to inspect then they are to continue under the assumption that they DO NOT have permission to enter the property. If you feel like it (as is your right), you could also state that you simply will be refusing all future inspections from now until the end of your tenancy.\n\nIf it's an HMO then they can enter the communal areas without notice and without permission but the above still applies to your bedroom.\n\nLook into getting the locks changed too. So long as you change them back again at the end of the tenancy you have every right to do this (even if your contract says you can't, it's unenforceable).\n\nCurrently there's no real legal action for you to take but after your complaint if this situation happens again you could possibly seek to report them to the police for harassment. It's unlikely anything will be done, but police involvement might scare them into rethinking their business practices.",

I am a PMO and 99% of people do not reply to notices of inspection or viewings, please ignore what other people are saying in regards to this being \"ilegal\" BUT A big failure in etiquette in terms of not knocking on your bedroom door to check you are in but again this is not ilegal.\n\n  \nIn terms of recourse there are no damages so there is no action to take. you can complain and ask it to be escalated to a manager and leave a bad review if you like which will likely lead to said agent being scolded as letting agnecies seriously care about there review score.
