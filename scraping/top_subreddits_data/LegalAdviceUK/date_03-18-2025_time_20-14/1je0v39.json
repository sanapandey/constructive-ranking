    "selftext": "We bought our house 15 years ago and 11 year ago installed a hot-tub and patio area in a private area of the garden.  My morning routine ever since is that I wake up, make a coffee and go and sit in the patio area to drink it in my dressing gown.  If the weather is nice enough and the mood takes me, I will de-robe and jump in the tub for 20 minutes, au naturel, before heading back in to shower and getting on with the day.\n\nThis was my morning routine for 8 years, until 3 years ago, someone bought the small parcel of land behind our house and applied for planning permission to build a house.  We objected as strongly as we could to this because the rear aspect of the new house had skylight windows looking towards our 'private' hot-tub area.  The planning officer agreed with our right to privacy and required the plans to be updated to include a line of screening trees between the two properties - they are detailed on the subsequent plans as such: \"trees for privacy screening to neighbouring property\".\n\nSo far so good, except that when the new house was finished, there was a distinct lack of trees.  We raised this to the builder/owner who took us round to show us the trees were there, they were just so small they didn't yet reach above the fence-line.  It was clear it was going to take 10-15 years for these trees to actually provide any sort of screening. So we engaged the council again who sent the planning officer round.  She eventually came to us and said that she wasn't going to require the builder to replace the trees because they had convinced her that these trees were the largest they could reasonably install at the time and, she said, in any case she'd been up to the attic rooms and that in order to see into our patio you actually had to be 'standing on a box with your head in the top corner of the sky-light recess'.  We weren't happy, but we relented to just get on with our lives.\n\nOnce again things were OK and I got on with my morning routine, though for the sake of my own dignity, I now carefully de-robe facing away from the neighbours skylights so the most they might see if being curious was my bare arse.  This went on fine until the neighbours sold their house 9 months ago.  Our new neighbours must be curtain twitchers because almost immediately they came round to complain that they'd seen me naked from the window of 'their daughters room' and they were not happy about it. I relayed the whole story to him and how you can only see this if you're standing in the window and we reached an impasse.  It seemed to die down and life went on.  Until a few weeks ago, when the neighbour came round again to say his daughter (teenage) has seen me naked in the garden and was 'upset'.  I told him pretty bluntly that I wasn't going to change my routine of 11 years just because someone built a house behind ours and perhaps he should tell his daughter to stop peeping out the window because you have to be watching from a pretty specific un-natural position to be able to see this.  This led to a pretty heated exchange with him then threatening to report me to the police if it happened again.\n\nI realise I'm being a little stubborn, but there is a small but life-style significant difference between jumping in the hot-tub on a whim in nice weather vs. planning to get in and changing into swimwear and having to dry them out afterwards etc (which I do if we ever have guests around!).  I'm not parading around naked and you can't see 'into' the tub from the windows, so it's literally the 5-10 seconds it takes me to take my robe off and step into the tub.\n\nWhere do I stand legally?  Firstly, is this a criminal matter and what would happen if he did report it to the police?  Secondly if it's a civil matter, what can they do?\n\nEDIT\n\nThanks for all the responses so far.  To clarify the setup, the neighbours house is about 40-50 meters away from the hot-tub, so the angle of the 'overlook' is about 40 degrees, they are looking almost 'sideways' onto the tub area hence why they can't see into the tub.  The fence line is much closer to their property however, as a result any screening applied on top of the 6ft fence that already exists would have to be an additional 10-15ft tall to obscure the skylights, which is not practical hence why the planning officer specified mature trees.  There is a large evergreen shrub on our side of the fence that we used to trim annually but we're now allowing to grow up vertically and should provide some screening to the offending window in a couple of years (it seems to be growing far faster than the crap trees they planted). Installing screening directly around the tub would block our own view of our garden which we don't want, though I think one of the commenters posts about installing a shorter screen at waist height would mostly do the trick and I will investigate that. I suppose it depends how 'persnickety' the neighbour wants to be as to whether he accepts this as a practical solution, as my top half would still be visible and they would 'know' I was still naked behind it.

Put the dressing gown on (back to the skylight). Take speedos off. Squeeze them out. Drape them over something (garden table/chair?) until the next day (OK, if rain is forecast bring them inside). Writing all that took longer than it would take to do it! Just seems a lot easier than writing to the council, making notes of things, etc etc. \n\n\n\n(Also you are putting a lot of weight on the word of the council worker who said that you could only see the tub standing on a box in the corner of the room - I assume you haven't been in the house and checked for yourself? Maybe she just wanted to close the case without any further work required and so exaggerated a bit. Maybe the girl CAN see you whenever she looks out of her window in the morning...)",

But as the Stephen Gough known as the \u201cNaked Rambler\u201d found, the reality is different. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Gough\n\n> In 2003 and 2004, he walked the length of Great Britain naked, but was arrested when he did it again in 2005 and 2006. Since then, he has spent most of the intervening years in prison, having been repeatedly rearrested for contempt of court for public nudity and imprisoned.[2] He has been convicted of public order offences at least 40 times. Gough brought a lawsuit in the European Court for Human Rights, arguing that laws requiring him to wear clothing violated his rights to privacy and free expression. His claim was rejected in 2014.[3",

Any screening along the fence line would have to be about 15feet tall, on top of the 6ft fence, which would be virtually impossible to install securely.  That is why the planning officer specified 'mature trees'.  Sadly it seems she failed to specify the minimum height.",

This would involve deliberately exposing genitalia towards another person with the intention of them seeing and being caused alarm or distress (sometimes referred to as indecent exposure).\nThe common law offence of outraging public decency\napplies when a person\u2019s behaviour is so lewd, obscene or\ndisgusting as to shock a reasonable person.
