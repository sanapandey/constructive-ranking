    "selftext": "Long story short - my license number has been used to pervert the cause of justice for other drivers\n\nThe person who has my details has been using my DLN to nominate me as a driver for different vehicles I have no connections to.\n\nThey used an address I\u2019m not a resident at and also no way of me finding out.\n\nI found out after realising I have points on my license  by getting a letter from the post from dvla saying my license has been revoked.\n\nI asked dvla if they can change my license but they just keep saying they\u2019ll put a admin marker on my profile - this will make it so I won\u2019t be able to check my status online nor if I call them up by phone\u2026 only way is to contact them through post. This is not affective enough\n\nI really want to change my license number and need help and some sort of guidance to turn to.\n\nAny help with be appreciated ",

DVLA CEO wrote to my MP and confirmed that I needed no restrictions on my licence and I keep a copy to this day though I can happily drive a manual or automatic with a prosthetic now.",
