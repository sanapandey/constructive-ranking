    "selftext": "A few days ago I bought an item at 400\u00a3 in England which was actually cheaper than it usually is, as it\u2019s normal around \u00a3550, so to me this was already odd but just felt like a good deal.\n\nFast forward to today and they have sent me an email saying they made a mistake and they sold me a \u201cv2\u201d model for the price of a \u201cv1\u201d and they requested that I either pay the difference or return the \u201cv2\u201d for the v1. \n\nAm I allowed to ignore them as It is their mistake? Or will I be taken to court?",

An offer to tender was made, a consideration was transferred and the item delivered to complete the contract.\n\nThey could have refused to send the item and refunded you. As many stores have done.   \n\nWas the price and item you saw advertised the v2?  Or was it the v1 that was offered for sale and they shipped something different?   I am guessing the former from your description of the good deal.",

Which is a reasonable understanding of the events - given they trailed v1, and that's the one which went through the till.\n\nGiven the context OP described in comments I would say the store are within their rights.",

It's called a mistake of fact and is different to them mispricing an item and selling you the correct item for the wrong price.\n\nTechnically failure to return it could be a criminal offence (Theft by Finding) or they could pursue a civil claim against you.\n\nDo not listen to any advice about \"they've agreed a contract\" or whatever. You have a contract to purchase one item, which they will need to supply you or provide a refund. You've technically never purchased the item you have and it still belongs to the store.\n\nVery likely of course they would be prepared to offer you a discount, especially if you've used it, to keep the current item but if not go and swap it for the right item.",
