    "selftext": "I went out clubbing with a friend of mine and about 20 others. We're dancing, having a good time, when suddenly my friend is accused of accidentally breaking a TV. They take his number and name and he gets incredibly stressed. A couple of days later, he's messaged them asking to see CCTV footage of him doing it but they refuse and say \"we just know it was you\". Nobody in our group saw him smash this TV but the guy from the club is telling my mate he has to pay for the damages. My mate is now stressed out of his mind worrying he's going to pay for something he can't afford and is now trying to sell his belongings to try and afford it. \n\nWhat can he do in this situation? We've suggested he cut contact because they're probably trying to scam him and to only pay when he sees the CCTV proof of him doing it.",
