    "selftext": "I live on a new build estate where all the gardens are connected at the back of the houses in a rectangle. One of my neighbours has a cat, who is outside basically all of the daytime. My garden is in the middle of a bunch of gardens, so the cat regularly uses my garden as a thoroughfare, chasing birds in my garden or just chilling in the sun in the summer. It\u2019s a very friendly cat, it approaches me and lets me stroke it, so I don\u2019t mind it being there. \n\nThe cat frequently uses my barbecue, which is next to the fence next to the cat owners\u2019 garden, as step down into my garden. At the weekend, very unfortunately, the barbecue was lit and very hot for the first time this year. I was inside, but i heard a shriek and ran outside to find the cat cowering licking its paws underneath my garden chair. The cat had clearly jumped onto my barbecue and burnt its feet quite badly, it looked like the skin had stuck to the barbecue lid and then came off when it had leapt down. \n\nI immediately grabbed the cat and began to hose its feet, as thats what i thought i should have done. I had to hold it by the scruff of its neck, as it understandably did not like this at all. After a few minutes of this, i took it round to the neighbours house, and they rushed it off to the vets.\n\nThis evening, they have come round and given me a letter, written by themselves, not a solicitor at this point, saying i am responsible for what happened and asking for money for vet bills. They have included an invoice from the vets, and it is significant (>\u00a32000) as it involved skin grafts and overnight stays. They are claiming that because:\n\n1. I have been seen to \u2018entice\u2019 the cat into my garden by stroking it and giving it attention\n2. I shouldn\u2019t have left a lit barbecue unattended ( i was only in my kitchen and have sight of the barbecue most of the time, i was checking it regularly anyway)\n3. I added unnecessary mental trauma on top of the physical trauma by hosing the cat down and returning it soaking wet ( i only tried to get its feet but it was struggling a lot so it got very wet), and the cat hates to get wet. \n\nI am absolutely beside myself from what happened to the cat, but i do not believe i should be held responsible legally. I will definitely not be barbecuing against the fence any more, but i did not entice the cat into my garden, and never have. I\u2019ve done some research and seen that cats are considered to be \u2018free spirits\u2019, in that the owners cannot be held responsible for what a cat does. I imagine it goes both ways, but i cannot find anything explicitly that says i would not be responsible. I can only find information that cats are regarded as property, and so if intentionally caused damage then i would be responsible. \n\nDoes anyone have advice? They say if i don\u2019t come to an agreement they will be seeking legal advice. Thanks ",
