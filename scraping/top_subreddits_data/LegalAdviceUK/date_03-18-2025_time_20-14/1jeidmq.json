    "selftext": "Last Friday I signed the lease for a new flat (unfurnished, letting agency serviced) and paid 1.5 months deposit and the first months rent. When I viewed the flat at a first glance (it was a group viewing) everything seemed in good shape. Today however, I picked up the keys and upon closer inspection the flat in a serious need of repair and painting/decorating. There\u2019s holes in all walls from fixtures used by previous tenants, wallpaper is peeling off walls, scuffs and dirt marks on all walls, the floor boards are chipped and corners are sticking out. All internal door handles are seriously worn out. What\u2019s worse, I was never told that the electric and gas operate on a prepaid card (you need to top it up at the shops) which is the most expensive way of getting supplied. \nI have received the detailed inventory today and all the above issues were detailed but the pics were taken from the distance and don\u2019t reflect the poor state of walls and general poor condition of the flat. \nIm now very anxious about living in a flat with so many issues especially when I paid 1.5 times the deposit.  The rent is in line with the market for a newly renovated flat, so no discounts had been made. I have 2 questions: \n1. Can I ask the landlord to cover holes in walls and redecorate the flat throughout as well as repair floorboards and install a proper meter for electricity and Gas? \n2. Is it too late for me to pull out this tenancy? It\u2019s only been 8 hours since I picked up the keys. \n",

            "body": "I would highly doubt you could pull out after having had a viewing. What I would suggest is very first thing you do is picture/video everything. Every problem. Document it all, and email it all to the agent/landlord. It\u2019ll save yourself a lot of trouble down the line. Unless things are a health hazard I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll rush to fix anything. \n\nIn regards to the meters you\u2019d probably need to check your contract to see what it says about it. There may be historic reasons why the energy supplier won\u2019t install a meter in which case you may have to change supplier.",

            "body": "1. You can ask, but as the issues are cosmetic rather than repairs issues the landlord is under no obligation. \n\n2. Unlikely. There is nothing in your post that would allow you to unwind the tenancy.\n\nThe plus side is that you only have to return in that state at the end of your tenancy.\n\nFor your own security, take your own dated photographic record of the condition and email it to the landlord. And let them know of anything that actually needs repairing to work.",
