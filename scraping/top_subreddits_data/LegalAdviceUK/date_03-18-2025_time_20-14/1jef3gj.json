    "selftext": "Hey there, I've recently moved house and our landlord at our old property sent us the full deposit amount from one of the deposit scheme companies and is now turning around and trying to say we owe him part of the deposit back and that we agreed to pay that portion.\n\nMy question is as he skirted around removing that money through the deposit company do we need to pay him? My ex-flatmates believe that we're fine and that as he didn't use the legal means he's just trying to take money from us (Which is believable, he was a horrible landlord, who broke several laws in our time there we were just young and naive.) however the whole situation just has me really stressed, I can't seem to stop thinking about it and I guess I just wanted some advice on what to do and whether I should just send him the money? Based in Scotland by the way.\n\nTLDR\n\nLandlord sent us full deposit back through deposit company,\n\nHe's saying we owe him a portion for damages sustained during our time living there,\n\nI'm wondering what I should do as its stressing me out a bit.\n\nBased in Scotland, and thank you in advance for anyone willing to lend some advice!\n\n  \nEarly update\n\nIt seems pretty clear my flatmates were correct, thank you everyone! I kind of felt like this was the case however my brains pretty anxious about these things so sincerly thank you.",
