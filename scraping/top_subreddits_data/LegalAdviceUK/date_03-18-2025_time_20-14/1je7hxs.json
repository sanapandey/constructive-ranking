    "selftext": "Based in Northern Ireland. Just been quoted \u00a38000 for a replacement engine from a Hyundai dealership due to \"oil starvation\" after car wouldn't start. \n\nThe car is 10 months outside warranty, only 1 month after full service at said garage, 44k miles on it, 14 HP payments still to make.\n\nWe booked the car in for a service in December and notified them off and engine warning light that had came on the previous week. The mechanic flagged a few issues that needed fixed but we didn't sign off the work on time and car was taken off the ramp. We had to rebook for February.\n\nTwo days before the mechanic visit the car died, wouldn't start and couldn't be jumped. Had to be towed to the dealership. That when I was told it would be \u00a31000 to open the engine to diagnose the problem. That done I'm now being told I need a new engine and more due to oil starvation yet I checked the oil and it was fine. \n\nThe car had been serviced in 2023 in an independent mechanic and I provided receipt of the service including part numbers, oil grade and quantity to Hyundai. They did the most recent service. The dealership said because the service in 2023 was late by 4 months I was responsible however this was at the height of COVID and we only went with that mechanic because the dealership was backed up. The most recent service was 5 months over a year, this was an oversight by me. Both years milage fell below 10,000 miles at the time of service. The car has only 44k on it.\n\nWe have 14 HP payments still to make and the cost of repairs are the same as our settlement figure from the finance company. \n\nI have asked Hyundai for a goodwill warranty contribution to part or all of the repairs but haven't heard back and I'm not confident after the dealership telling me they don't think I have a case. \n\nDo I have any recourse? The last oil change, a month before it's death was at the Hyundai dealership. Surely signs should have been spotted of a critical failure then. We haven't had any identification of a problem apart from engine warning lights shortly appearing before the first service. Additionally, when we had to pick up the car after the service, the warning lights were still on and weren't addressed in the diagnostic report.\n\nAny help would be massively appreciated. I am being asked for \u00a38000+.",

            "body": "Hello, I know its not too much help but oil starvation could be completely unrelated to the oil level, for example you could have exactly the right amount of oil in the engine but if your oil pump fails and does not supply it around the engine then its game over.\n\n  \nYour best course of action might be to find other similar cases online, perhaps a second independent inspection and then make a plea to Hyundai Head Office for a gesture of goodwill. Arguably an engine failure after this period of time is premature. \n\n  \nPlaying devils advocate, if I read it right you drove a car with an oil problem from Dec to February knowing this and could arguably have caused this by driving a known faulty car.",

There was no oil light on at that point, it came on intermittently a few days prior to the December service. But it went away again. The engine light was solid throughout. Because the dealership couldn't do the work (change two tyres, repair damaged diff seal) we had to take it back until our rebook in February. I made a point of asking them was it OK to drive and they said \"the tyres needed replaced asap\" which I did that afternoon on the way home.\n\nI am a cautious person so we used our other vehicle all through January. The one time I tried to start it was in February two days before our appointment to take it to the car wash and that's when it wouldn't start.",

Even a mechanic friend who can spare some time.\n\nThis is anecdotal but I have zero trust for Hyundai dealerships after I took on a car that had been stood for two years. They tried to claim everything needed replacing and had some big prices there. I had another garage do what was actually necessary and suddenly, the \u00a32400 Hyundai had quoted me for a new air con compressor and rear axel disappeared off their IMPORTANT/URGENT list on the health check.\n\nWhat car mode and year is this? Hyundai KIA lost a class action law suit over so many engines dying in some models.\n\nWhat did they say caused it? Lack of oil, improper oil filter installation, or a pre-existing engine issue that may have been exacerbated by the oil change. This is all very important information and why a second opinion may be helpful. If it was something such as bad oil filter installation and Hyundai have done \\*all\\* your oil changes, then that gives you a strong position to fight from, for example.\n\nThe warning light being on, you driving the car with the warning light on for months and only getting a Feb rebook from December thought goes against you. A lot more information is required.",

It's a 6 year old car, we've had it for 3 years.\n\nWe were due to book the car in for a service as MOT was due in Decemeber. The week prior my wife said she saw the oil light come on and go off a couple of times on her trip home as well as the engine light. I immediately checked the oil and levels were good. This was the week before the service. I took the car out and got no oil light but solid engine light. I notified the dealership of this when confirming the service and MOT check. \n\nThe car was brought in and service done. We were told to change two tyres, new wipers and a diff seal needed replaced. No mention of the warning lights. My wife   didn't sign off on the work after viewing the diagnostics video on time so it was taken off the rack and we were told to collect it and bring it back in February. I notified them that the engine light was still solid and told it would be looked at in February. \n\nWe decided to not drive the car and rely on our other Hyundai. Just before the Feb appointment I went to take the car for a car wash and it refused to come on and couldn't be jumped. It was towed to the dealership.\n\nAfter agreeing to \u00a31000 to remove and inspect the engine we were told it needed a new engine. \u00a38000 in all. I asked what was the reason and they said \"oil starvation probably\". They were not able to give me a definitive cause or say exactly why it happened. \n\nI called Hyundai and they made me jump through some hoops to prove an independent service done in 2023. I had to get proof of part numbers for the replaced filters as well as proof of the oil grade and quantity used by tbe independent mechanics. I did all this and have heard nothing back from either the dealership or Hyundai. I am waiting on a call back now.",

It has an oil belt, the oil belt broke and I got a \u2018low oil pressure warning\u2019 as soon as it broke whilst driving. Luckily for me it was fixable as I didn\u2019t drive it for very long afterwards. It\u2019s cost me \u00a31700 as it also stretched my timing chain so had to have that replaced too but the engine was otherwise ok. My cars done 50,000 miles. I asked the garage why it happened as it\u2019s only just 5 years old and he said the oil belts are meant to be changed at 40,000-50,000 miles (ludicrous really as that could be as little as 3.5/4 years driving). Also on the focus the oil belt is in a stupid place which involves getting the engine out to change it so it\u2019s not a cheap bit of maintenance. \nLong story short I\u2019m now very dubious of the longevity of any car made 2018 onwards as they now seem to be suffering from the bullshit all companies are peddling - sell it expensive, make it break, continually collect money from idiot consumer.
