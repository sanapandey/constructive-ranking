    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m seeking advice on how to handle a situation my uncle is facing with EON Energy, which has been ongoing for about 2-3 years. He owns a second residential property in England that has been under renovation, and no one has lived there for an extended period, so meter readings weren\u2019t submitted. As a result, EON has been estimating his bills for both gas and electricity.\n\nInitially, his bills had accumulated to around \u00a324,000 based on these estimated readings. After submitting proof and letters explaining no one was living at the property during certain periods, the bill was reduced to \u00a34,166, valid until June 2024.\n\nHowever, my uncle is retired, living on a pension that barely covers his essential bills, and the outstanding amount has now surged again due to the estimated readings. As of 12/03/2025, the amount due is \u00a39,192.29. This isn\u2019t the first time there\u2019s been an issue with these charges, but we were able to resolve it by sending the correct meter readings, which brought the bill down to \u00a34,214 previously.\n\nWe\u2019re currently in the process of updating the meter readings again to correct the balance, which should bring the amount owed down to approximately \u00a34,000. However, my uncle has now received a letter from HMCTS, notifying him that EON has issued a money claim for \u00a38,668, along with a court fee of \u00a3455 and legal representative fees of \u00a3100, making the total claim \u00a39,223.\n\nI immediately called EON\u2019s helpline to discuss this, but the agent was unhelpful and rude, repeatedly asking how much I was going to pay today, without addressing the fact that the balance includes erroneous charges due to estimated readings. I was unable to make any progress with them, and the system is still being updated with the correct readings.\n\nGiven that the amount EON is claiming includes inflated charges, how do we explain this to the tribunal? I\u2019m unsure how to proceed from here, as we\u2019ve never encountered a situation like this before. Any advice on how to resolve this or handle the court claim would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",
