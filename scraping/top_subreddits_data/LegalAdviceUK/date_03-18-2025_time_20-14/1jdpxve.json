    "selftext": "Worked for current job for 6 years, 3 years ago I was given the position of training manager after doing a course to gain a qualification.\n\nI was now given the position to train other employees across the company, however my main duties still involved day to day tasks so it was basically an additional role to my normal work.\n\nMy contract was not updated, I only received a letter to say that I was now in the position of training manager and would recieve a \u00a31 an hour pay rise (I still have this letter)\n\nI trained new employees when we had them for around a year, then 2 years ago we had a long period with no new employees but recently we had some new starters about 6 months ago.\n\nI found out that regular employees were training them and inquired but was told that it was because I wasn't available at the time and they needed to be trained fast (I did have some time off for sickness)\n\nI learned again a few weeks ago after more new employees started that they were again being trained by regular employees.\n\nI asked again why I wasn't the one to train them or even been informed they were starting and our boss overheard and asked me why would we get you to train them?\n\nI told them because that's what my job role was.\n\nThey then told me that no, that position was made redundant 1 year after I qualified (2 years ago) and that I would have been told this (I wasn't) so they needed to investigate this.\n\nI was pulled into the office suddenly today with a HR representative from head office and my boss saying that my job had been made redundant 2 years ago and I need to sign this paper authorising them to take back the extra wages I had earned in those 2 years as this would count as overpaid wages.\n\nI asked for evidence I had been told this role was made redundant and they said they couldn't provide any and I would have been told in person, but they were telling me now and if I don't sign it they would sack me and take me to court for the overpayment.\n\nI did not sign it and said I was going to get legal advice, they tried to coax me into signing it even though it didn't have a total, just said \"overpaid wages\".\nWhen I questioned this they said they are still working out the exact amount m, so they want me to sign for an undetermined amount? But agree before I see the total.\n\nEventually they told me that I would need to sign it by the end of the week or I'm out as they would see this as gross misconduct as I owe them money, and to take this as my official notice of termination unless I sign the paperwork.\n\nI haven't been able to find anything online about this and haven't been able to contact a solicitor during the day, I couldn't get through to anyone.\n\nIs this something they can legally do?\nIt doesn't seem legal and can they make me redundant in the past if they forgot to tell me?",

You have a contract stating X, they have continued to pay you in like with that contract and they have never superseded it. They need to produce evidence of a new contract that they and you have signed since that other one you hold.\u00a0\n\n\nTo all intents and purposes, you are a training manager, it's their fault they haven't given you anybody to train.\u00a0 You have offered your services to provide training, so they can't accuse you of trying to hide the fact.\u00a0\n\n\nYou are 6 years into employment so any threat or action they take against you can and will be in scope for constructive dismissal.\u00a0\n\n\nTLDR; they paid you in line with your contract, if they want to revisit your contract going forwards they need to follow the rules around that, but they can fuck right off if they want to unwind 2 years of transactions just because they \"meant\" to do something back then. HR and your boss are likely trying to cover their ass.\u00a0",

At all. \n\nTrust me when I tell you that was any of this true, the first thing your boss would\u2019ve done is go to a HR BP and get their advice. HR would\u2019ve contacted payroll to calc the gross and net overpayment amount. If that couldn\u2019t be done before the deadline for the next payroll you\u2019d have been advised of the gross amount (as that\u2019s easy to work out). You\u2019d have been asked about repayment. If you refused like you have done then Payroll andHR would evaluate Estoppel in your case and you\u2019d be told that because of those rules, you\u2019re not liable to repay anything. \n\nThey wouldn\u2019t need you to sign anything. Employers can recover overpayments of salary and expenses without notifying you in writing or obtaining your consent, as per section 14 of the employment rights act 1996. \n\nThey\u2019re asking you to consent because they know that you do not have to pay this back to them. Email them NOW and tell them you\u2019ve met all of the Estoppel criteria (I\u2019ve pasted them below for you) and that the letter they gave you was not Fixed Term or a secondment and is therefore a permanent pay increase. \n\nEstoppel criteria (basic language): \n\n- employee must not have caused the overpayment (I.E submitted false expense claims, overtime forms, etc) \n- employee must have been led to believe, by the employer, that these funds were rightfully theirs (I.E the letter they gave you and your role changing to account for new tasks)\n- employee must have acknowledged the increase in pay and reasonably adjusted their living costs to account for it, and spent some or all of the overpaid funds (e.g getting a new property, changing diet, etc) \n\nEstoppel criteria (legalese for the email to them):\n\nTo qualify for protection under promissory estoppel the employee must satisfy 3 conditions:\n\n1. That their employer made representations of fact that entitled them to believe that the sum if money overpaid was theirs; and\n2. That the employee has \u201cchanged their position\u201d (by spending some or all of the money) and in doing so acted in good faith and without notice that their employer wished to recoup the overpayment; and\n3. That the employee was not primarily at fault for the mistake\n \nSend the email now and tell them you\u2019ll be in touch with ACAS regarding the threat of termination. As you have 2 years service, you do have the ability to take them to tribunal. I would mention both of these things in the email.",

ACAA/Union/Lawyers well help you with successful claims. The employer handbook will help you understand the correct steps the company should have taken to communicate the changes as well as the current situation - which they are clearly not doing still.\n\nDepending on what kind of people are above your manager and manage HR, they might sack them instead but I think that's less likely than your having to leave because of this. You have the makings of a successful claim though, based on what you wrote.\n\nSeek advice outside and at the company ask to explain the basis of those requests you mentioned, in writing. Even the meeting you got called into should have a written summary to inform you of the demands or else it sounds like bullying you into talking the fall. Good luck.",
