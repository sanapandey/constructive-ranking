    "selftext": "Asking a question for my mother -\n\nMy mum is due to retire at the end of this month. She has been off sick for a week and has been further signed off by her GP until the end of the month, coinciding with her retirement date. She works for her local council, has been employed there more than 20 years, and lives in Scotland. \n\nHer issue is that her line manager is persistently contacting her, adding further stress to her sickness. The line manager is demanding she come into work to fill out an 'occupational health form' and attend an appointment. In addition she messages my mum privately via WhatsApp to tell her 'personnel are on to me about when you are coming back', '[other management] want to know when you're coming back', and other demands of a similar nature.\n\nMy mum has had issues with this line manager in the past, in which her union was involved, as her line manager had attempted to put her on a performance improvement plan (essentially to manage her out).\n\nMy mum is retiring early because work has been an ongoing stress for a few years now, coincidentally when this line manager took up their role. Unfortunately, this hasn't been the seamless retirement she hoped for, and is now fretting that her line manager will somehow ruin it by impacting her pension, which I've tried to reassure her she absolutely does not have the ability to do.\n\nIt's my understanding that when signed off by your GP your employer should only be in touch in a supportive manner. However, as my mum is retiring, does she have more to answer for? What actions can she take in this scenario? Does she have to contact HR or alternative channels? Any advice would be great, thank you.",

I wonder if the HR team will agree with this managers interpretation of what level of contact is required for someone signed off. \n\nMention previous issue with this manager, and seems like this is boarding harassment and is severally impacting her mental health and recovery.\n\nAsk why any manager other than her own would possibly have reason to ask when she is back. They may have a good reason or just be concerned if they have known your mum a long time, but still, is private medical info being disclosed to those that have no need to know it. \n\nDo not be afraid, if your mum has the appropriate Dr's certs she is covered. Get the union to do its thing and protect its members",

And if she's retiring anyway, pointless harassment at that.\n\nI would go straight to the nuclear option given that there is previous history regarding this manager. \n\nThat is to say, one final reply to the latest comms from him, basically saying that she has nothing to say to him; if there are questions regarding her retirement then personnel can call her directly - my money is on there being no involvement from personnel at all; and any further messages from him will be regarded as harassment, and will result in your mum raising a formal grievance against the manager, with his harassment being the reason for said grievance.",
