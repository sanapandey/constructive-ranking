    "selftext": "The Labour Government have published a series of bills that will make significant changes to some bits of the law in England, Wales and Scotland that are discussed here on a frequent basis - things like unfair dismissal rights, and no-fault evictions.\n\nTo try and keep on top of where those proposals have got to, we'll update this post as the various bills progress. The law has not changed yet, and we do not currently know when it will change.\n\nImportantly, it won't change for everyone straight away - there will be transition periods for lots of these changes. However, [the government have said](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2024-09-10/5134) that they intend the changes to housing law (abolishing fixed-term contracts) to come into effect in one go, so existing FT contracts will become periodic.\n\n**Housing law** (applies mainly to England, but some parts to Scotland and Wales as well)\n\n* [Renters' Rights Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3764)\n* [Commons Library briefing paper](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10106/)\n* [Explanatory notes](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/59-01/0008/en/240008en.pdf)\n* Status as of Nov 24: most of the way through the House of Commons, still got to go through the House of Lords\n\nThis Bill is likely to make very significant changes to \"assured shorthold\" tenancies in England - these are the normal \"private rented\" tenancy that anyone who doesn't rent from a council or housing association is likely to have. In brief, it will abolish them, reverting to \"assured tenancies\", which will be monthly periodic, but will roll on forever. Landlords will no longer be able to evict people using \"section 21\" notices which do not require a reason, but tenants will be able to leave with 2 months' notice.\n\nThe Bill will also outlaw in England the practice of \"bidding\" to rent a property, in England give tenants a statutory right to keep pets which landlords cannot unreasonably refuse, and in England, Wales and Scotland make it illegal to discriminate against people with children or people on benefits when it comes to letting & managing properties.\n\nThere will also be more regulation in England: a single national ombudsman for complaints, a database of landlords, and common standards for private homes that all landlords must provide. Enforcement powers will also be improved.\n\n**Employment law** (applies to England, Wales and Scotland)\n\n* [Employment Rights Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3737)\n* [Commons Library briefing paper](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10109/)\n* [Explanatory notes](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/59-01/0011/en/240011en.pdf)\n* Status as of Nov 24: waiting to go into Committee in the House of Commons, and after that through the House of Lords\n\nThis Bill makes significant changes to employment rights law. Most notably, it abolishes the minimum two-year period of employment required before you can take your employer to a tribunal. This means that employers will no longer be able to dismiss someone with less then two years' service, unless they have a good reason. There will be a statutory \"probation\" period during which it will be *easier* to dismiss someone.\n\nThe Bill will also make changes in respect of:\n\n* zero hours contracts, introducing a right to reasonable notice of shifts and to be offered a contract with guaranteed hours, reflecting hours regularly worked\n* flexible working, requiring employers to justify the refusal of flexible working requests\n* statutory sick pay, removing the three-day waiting period (so employees are eligible from the first day of illness or injury) and the lower earnings limit test for eligibility\n* family leave, removing the qualifying period for paternity leave and ordinary parental leave (so employees have the right from the first day of employment), and expanding eligibility for bereavement leave\n* protection from harassment, expanding employers\u2019 duties to prevent harassment of staff\n* \"fire and rehire\", making it automatically unfair to dismiss workers because they refuse to agree to a variation of contract",

Landlords will only be able to evict under certain circumstances - like selling the home or moving back into the property - but how easy is it for them to just say they are doing that but never following up. There is no way councils will police it. Tenancies should be allowed to have fixed lengths if both the tenant and landlord agree",

The landlord cannot just seek possession during the fixed term for spurious reasons like wanting to sell the property or moving back in. The new act provides no long term security and as I already mentioned who is going to police that the landlord moves back in or sells the property? It would be a civil matter and only followed up on if the evicted tenant pursues. What happens in practice will be very different from what is written. If you have any idea about how the industry works I think you already know this.",

In practice how often is someone going to check or be able to check that, say, a close relative of the landlord has moved into the property?\n\nI also wonder what happens if there's some good reason a person doesn't move in or the property isn't sold (eg. a relative was going to move in but changed their mind - that's not under the LL's control). Or if the landlord dishonestly claims this is the case.\n\nIIRC the Local Government Association has argued that penalties for landlords should be increased, which could serve as more of a deterrent.",

                    "body": "It's a good question! Clause 10 inserts new sections 16A-C into the Housing Act 1988. s16C will specifically provide for circumstances in which the landlord can refuse consent for the pet:\n\n>(4) The circumstances in which it is reasonable for a landlord to refuse consent include those in which\u2014  \n>  \n>(a) the pet being kept at the dwelling-house would cause the landlord to be in breach of an agreement with a superior landlord;  \n>  \n>(b) an agreement between the landlord and a superior landlord prohibits the keeping of a pet at the dwelling-house without consent of the superior landlord, and the landlord has taken reasonable steps to obtain that consent but the superior landlord has not given it.\n\nThe new sections will not have any effect on agreements other than assured tenancies, so they will not affect the operation of leases. So the bottom line is: if the lease prohibits pets, then the landlord need not consent to the keeping of them.\n\nHowever, interestingly, it is possible that this statutory provision will conflict with this subreddit's favourite piece of legislation, [section 12 of the Allotments Act 1950](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/14/31/section/12), which permits the keeping of rabbits and hens even in a flat.\n\nThe good thing is that section 12 operates against provisions \"in any lease or tenancy or in any covenant, contract or undertaking relating to the use to be made of any land\". New section 16A will imply a term into every tenancy agreement: this is not the same as that term having the force of statute.\n\nBut the proviso in s12 says:\n\n>Provided that nothing in this subsection shall authorise any hens or rabbits to be kept in such a place or in such a manner as to ... affect the operation of any enactment.\n\nYou could well argue that section 12 \"effects the operation of\" new section 16A.",
