    "selftext": "Hello I was just wondering if this deco placement is good, not exact floor plan but its close enough to get a visual for how the deco will be placed with walls and such that could be getting in the way. The house is 2,171 SQ FT and I want to have a good internet/ethernet connection in the bedroom were deco 3 is showing. I am wondering if I should move deco 2 to a room that is upstairs a bit above the kitchen or would that not be ideal to keep internet connection good for devices that I have in the living room? Currently theres a PS5 over there that has some issues currently with connection issues with the ISP modem/router combo so I was looking at getting\u00a0TP-Link - Deco XE75 Pro AXE5400 or the Deco X25 AX1800 but I was afraid that my speeds in the bedroom deco 3 would be slower than what I am looking to get, Currently I have 1.2GBPS package with ISP but get only 100MBPS with their xfi pod in the room deco 3 would be located. Let me know what would be best thank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epoaf25bfjpe1.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=87b9da352f173d349d6c5dd78dfeef36c7994a5b",
