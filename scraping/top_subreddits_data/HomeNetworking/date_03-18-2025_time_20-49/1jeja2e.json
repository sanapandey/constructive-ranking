    "selftext": "Looking for some very practical home networking advice. In the pictures is the line that runs to the ONT for our fiber Internet. You can see in the second pic how baked the cable is getting in the hot western sun. Does anyone have a good solution for protecting it from the elements? It\u2019s curved so it\u2019s a bit tough to put inside a conduit. I\u2019m thinking some wire loom, but wanted to open it up to see if anyone had any other suggestions. Thanks!",
