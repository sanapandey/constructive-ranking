Other, future posts will be deleted.\n\nThe following is an AI summary:\n\n> **The US government is considering a ban on TP-Link routers due to cybersecurity concerns and potential national security risks.** \n\n> #Why the consideration?\n> \n> **Security flaws**\n\n>  TP-Link has had security flaws and some say the company doesn't do enough to patch vulnerabilities \n> \n> **Links to China**\n\n> TP-Link is a Chinese company and some are concerned about its ties to China \n\n> **Chinese threat actors**\n\n> Chinese hackers have broken into US internet providers, and some worry TP-Link could be compromised \n> \n> **TP-Link's response**\n> \n> * TP-Link says it's a US company that's separate from TP-Link Tech in China\n\n> \n> * TP-Link says it's working with the US government to address security concerns \n> * TP-Link says it doesn't sell routers in the US that have cybersecurity vulnerabilities \n> \n> **What happens next?**\n> \n> The fate of TP-Link routers is still uncertain \n> \n> If the government decides to ban TP-Link, it might replace existing routers with American alternatives \n> \n\nAs noted, no ban has been instituted, nor is it clear whether some or all TP-Link products will be included.",

The erx bricked with an update and I had to buy a special cable to fix it, or wait for them to warranty it. Ubiquiti eventually pulled the update, the subsequent updates killed the performance of the erx, so I had to keep it on an old firmware. The ap just plain sucked for WiFi, my ISP provided gateway had better coverage and speeds plug and play. I spent hours numerous times trying different controller versions, firmwares and settings trying to match what my ISP gateway provided out of the box. The uptime on the ap wasn't bad, just the performance and experience.\n\nFor Omada, I am just happy it works with minimal configuration I am getting the performance I expect and almost zero downtime.",

So I'm not fully in the unifi ecosystem either.\n\nMy point is I'm not sure your experience really is that relevant to what most people think of as the \"unifi\" experience.  It's not my cup of tea personally because I like more flexibility than what the unifi network application provides, but most people who compare omada to unifi like omada based more on price vs performance rather than any shortcomings in the ubiquiti hardware.",

Just like I don't care about your private VLANs, or local networks being compromised. I don't want those devices, your devices or anyone else's, on the internet participating in an ever growing threat of botnets on an unimagined scale. \n\nAll a private VLAN is significantly reduce the likelihood of propogation from IoT device to private network. That's one attack vector, and as pointed out above its not the most existential threat certainly not the one that's currently the most prevalent, nor the one people should be most concerned with.\n\n>Maybe some of them can't be local control and require to have internet access to be remotly controlled even with a solution like home assistant or openhab?\n\nLike what. As you've been told, you're doing it wrong.\n\n>Maybe I want to have alexa or google voice control with them?\n\nDo you always live with so much doubt?\nThis can be done entirely privately without providing the people who have more data about you aggregated than your own collection knowing in micro detail what is happening in your home at any given time. Call it reverse proxy for your schizophrenic smart home that requires both Amazon & Google's voice integration services.\nThe alternative being to use your own voice assistant with support to the full extent of the LLM of your choice, voice of Arnold Swartzenneger, and begins taking input when say \"Umm maybe...\" - \"turn on the TV\".

And it doesn't matter if it's a little left or right long it's close it'll work. Clearly sound electrical engineering training I see. \n\nFuckin clandestine trip to the electronics manufacturing facility in some 3rd world country that nobody had noticed, not to mention facilities to unload the containers, because I totally see covertly entering a foreign trade port unloading containers then just idling in circles for a few days, with an entire crew oblivious to the random stop and wait/behaviour entirely different to the every single trip they've had previously - All whilst the labour force that teleported into said country in order to stay James Bond, manually unbox, disassemble perform magical chip removals and what hand soldering them back on looking exactly the same I suppose? Then reversing the entire process including replacing all broken seals and packaging, stacking . Did they board the entire staff of the NSA on that container ship in order to pull off the covert OP with a requirement reliant on entirely manual labour on thousands or tens of devices? \n\nI imagine they just googled the hardware and the schematics of an unreleased product was just sitting on the open internet, so they jumped on alibaba and had thousands upon thousands of these chips manufactured and priority shipped to Nigeria at that clandestine facility nobody knows about. Where they've already reverse engineered the source code they don't have yet so that it's ready to program all 50k chips that have also been made physically unidentifiable from the finished product they haven't seen - at this point the annual electricity consumption of Nigeria has reached a new high and its only July. \n\nNone of that hinging on the slightest mistake in any process being an extremely costly failure of a mission and exponentially increases the risk of exposure to almost certain. \n\nNow say all of that rubbish is true. Your country already owns you and every eletronic communication already, so what is this multi million dollar investments going to bring them that they didn't already have?\n\nNow, I'll say it again;\nWhere are the independently verifiable sources for this pathetic plot of for a TV mini-series that validates your claims into incontrovertible facts?\n\nUntil such time, it's your hyper-bullshit heavily detailed version of bullshit opinion, along with an infinite possibility of scenarios of opinions, each of which claiming to \"know\" the \"truth\". This is just so endemic on Reddit it's actually becoming disturbing how many people don't have a clue, yet can tell a really good story that backs up the falsehood and have people come away believing something which is false. For digital generations, there sure is very little care for authenticity. \nExistence does not provide implication for fact.\nExistence from your own cognition does not provide implication for fact.\nExistence in you and a thousand other members of your cult. \nJust like there is a standard to define a mathematical problem /solution as\n\nIt's amazing how much you **know** and aren't bound by NDA not to disclose, about the intricacies and play by play by % of a covert operation of your country sabotaging itself. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2b50\n\n> **The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove**. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever. However it is important to note that we can never be certain of anything, and so we must assign value to any claim based on the available evidence, and to dismiss something on the basis that it hasn't been proven beyond all doubt is also fallacious reasoning.\n\nCough up or shut up, i don't share your inhuman desire to disagree with others purely for the sake of (pathetically poorly chosen method of) attempting assert your dominance over those around you for your own self gratification. I'm not going to spell out the requisite for attainment of said proof. So either collate the proof for everyone to see, or start your arguments of response, but you're either going to be right or wrong relatively, so I really don't care to nor will I read beyond establishing what you've provided.\n\nI will however give you some time, because with the level of detail you've said is easy for your agency to achieve, so I imagine it's relatively easy to verify that information based on your level of (your narcissistic over inflated ego from previous keyboard warrior triumphs as though they're any level of measurement of anything except being an absolute tool) confidence.\n\n\"R.I.P Gone but will always be right\"",

Listing's are \"used - untested\" my package was sealed in box. \n\nIt's not the only brand I noticed a weird collection of, but it's by far the largest and widespread. I wish I could put a date on when I noticed it in relation to this event \n\nI literally have a TP-Link NVR I was planning to setup today thankfully that one i can at least isolate my AP & switches not so much. No national secrets here though.\n\nNor am I at all surprised by this stage. The first one or two were \"oh wows\" but now it's, assume that it's at least been attempted or occurred in every piece of electronics. If USA has already shown its capable of doing the same thing, and not just to the rest of the world but its own citizens by utilising the fact that it's a major transit path or destination for internet traffic.\n\nThough, on the contrary I like fact that blindly following what the mainstream media is reporting as fact is not something that can taken for granted in any country globally anymore I don't believe. Is it really convenient that these \"Chinese manufactured electronics\" are seemingly popping up in alot of places they shouldn't be being discovered by big US companies, or those who have a chunk of that market segment? Are they actively stepping up their game, or are you actively being gaslit by that man thing with dead animal in his head and his powerful friends, maybe his buddy with his own personal social media platform?\n\nI don't poke fun from afar unwavering, the world has a problem, nobody is immune it's just getting worse. Is this what the decade leading up to an international war goes like? I just know the wind has definitely changed direction and comes from a direction that doesn't smell good and leads to a place that doesn't look good.",

This is a user education problem. No matter what the device, users will end up disabling everything, because it is hard, and layers of protection are seen as obstacles.\n- cheap devices do not come with good enough practices. There should be a baseline for configuration. Think as requiring a physical button to change sensitive settings or adding a new device to a wifi network.\n- Alternative firmwares: there is dd-wrt, open-wrt, tomato, gargoyle, a ton of work has been already done to support those devices.\n- FCC does have procedures to test RF interference but no entity is testing for software security. Requiring manufacturers to provide source code and auditing of the devices could be done with relatively minimal effort.\n- Same thing for ISPs modems/devices. Those should run open source and be audited.\n- Also, one of the main objectives should be to provide a workflow as passwordless as possible. We humans are good moving switches. not so good at remembering or changing passwords.\n\nSo.. in escence any kind of ban is stupid, and if the objective is to really tighten up security, it won't be useful.",

There is evidence that TPLink routers and access points have pretty severe security flaws that could potentially expose a secure network to cybercrime.  Tplink could in theory solve this with firmware updates.  Whether or not they will is another issue altogether.  That said, a lot of the security vulnerabilities I read about relate to someone gaining access to the physical device, not just doing something over the network.  \n\nThe other side of the coin is more about politics than security, and it's the general consensus that China and the CCP are using TPLink devices to spy on American networks and traffic.  Whether or not that's true is difficult to say.  I personally haven't been able to find any evidence of this.  I've found a couple of people on Reddit claiming they found suspicious traffic on their network \"from the access point/router\".  I'm not sure if they knew what they were doing, or what the evidence was either, as I don't have the details.  I personally have had a TPLink EAP650 on my network since late October or early November, I don't remember exactly.  I looked at my opnsense firewall log this morning due to this concern.  I have 0 packets sent or received from my AP's MAC address or IP address through my WAN port.  So as far as I can tell nothing is going on currently.  \n\nIs it possible they could flip a switch and start spying on my network in soon?  I suppose.  Maybe the solution is to just block all inbound and outbound WAN traffic to the AP's address, and then nothing could access it remotely and it can't ping any servers. \n\nThat said, if they do end up banning sales of the devices, I won't be able to purchase any more matching AP's for my network, or who knows what else they ban.  So either I gamble and hope they don't ban them, or I need to find a replacement soon.  I tried Ubi APs and don't like it and had performance issues.  Now I'm looking into Mikrotik.",

Just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll buy the Decos again. \n\nI feel fine in using them as I don\u2019t use them in conjunction with the Tether app - just had no choice with the Deco.",

                            "body": "TP-Link are in fact multiple companies. The original company is still in China, while there are seperate companies - with different \"surnames\" with HQ in US and HQ in Singapore. This happend as late as spring 2024. Yeah, TP-Link likely saw what was coming... The HQ-part of TP-Link is under control of the brother of the guy running the Chinese part of the company. \n\nManufacturing as well is split between also other countries, including Vietnam and Thailand if I remember correctly.\n\nBut this sub-companies should still considered \"under control\" by the chinese HQ. There are also other brands that are owned by TP-Link, like Mercursys, that is starting to pop up quite a few places. I also have a suspicion that there is a another new brand that has appeared that is linked to TP-Link.  \n\nWhen it comes to the security issues in TP-Link products, I think it is similar to what we have seen from many others. And we have to remember how large the company is and how many users. When talking about \"number of security issues\", we have to remember that this company have a wider user base, there are more focus on them etc. Also, some of these issues are quite generic, meaning it is issues related to e.g. Linux services and chipset SDK from US companies like Broadcom and Qualcomm. Some of these issues, will aslo affect other vendors.\n\nIn my understanding, the main issue is that it can be seen as TP-Link is still tied down by potential orders from China. As in terms of security and privacy threat, we do need to remember that this is a \"fire once\" weapon. If it can be proven, the company is practically dead.\n\nAs of existing issues, we do need to remember that security issues created for future exploit, does not need to be a part of the shipped firmware. Most modern solutions have automatic firmware update - you can instead deploy them later, so that there are less chance of people noticing it.... For some of the security issues, they have also been on older devices that are still not under support. That said, some of the security issues are either bad implementation or \"suspicious\" (but i lean on just bad implementations....).\n\nThe other part here is also where is the software developed. Here in my understanding, the software development still is in China, even if the product is from a sub-company. So e.g. for TP-Link Systems Inc with HQ in the US, the software development is mainly in China, within the \"mother company\" (even if it is not the mother company on paper).\n\nCan also be started that for quite a few non-Chinese equipment vendors in this category, the software development is in China now.\n\nAlso - banning TP-Link, and there will be multiple other Chinese companies ready to step in. \n\nOverall, without further proof, I would still say the case as of today is mainly politics.",

Think of all the public libraries out there. What matters is the provenance of the software (i.e. who wrote it or has control over it). Open source public libraries are not a problem because they are usually monitored very closely. But, there have been cases where bad actors have tried to sneak vulnerabilities in. There was one [incident](https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/cyber-risk-management/news/xz-utils-backdoor-open-source-software-attack/) last year. It is concerned because it wasn't caught sooner.\n\nProprietary software is problematic because we have no visibility. But it goes back to provenance. \n\n> All items have the potential to be risky.\n\nBut all items do not have the same risk. In engineering design, risk is often characterized along two dimensions:\n\n1. The probably of a risk occurring\n2. The impact of a risk if it occurs\n\nFor example, you can have a risk that has a low probability of occurring but with high impact (e.g. the Hoover dam failing). Or a risk with high probability but low impact (e.g. a typo in online documentation).\n\nIt's not fruitful to be equally fearful of all products. We have to be more discerning.",

It seems to work well for home.  I also use Cisco's small business L3 switches and three 150ax wireless APs.  It is a nice setup for home.  There is no controller required for the wireless APs.  They are built-in as well as the backup controller as every Cisco small business AP has a controller built-in which automatically takes over if the primary controller goes down.  \n\nUsing Cisco small business switches and APs has firmware support for the life of the product. No license is required.  They are not up to enterprise standards but for home and small businesses they are great.",
