    "selftext": "Hello. \n\nOrdered a new 75\u2019 roll of Cat6 to run from router to Wireless AP. Used a tester to check before running and says split pairs on 1-2. \n\nCan I use this or return it to the shop? My 2 other rolls of 100\u2019 check out fine. \n\nTester is Sperry GMC-3000. \n\nThanks ",

Return them to where you got them from and provide the test images as proof or take the cable tester with you in case you go to the store personally. I believe you shouldn\u2019t have to much trouble sorting that out and exchanging it for a new one.",

            "body": "A split pair error occurs when one wire from each of two different pairs gets swapped identically on both ends of the cable.  So when a split pair occurs the tester should show the error on *two* pairs, not just one.  If just one pair is showing as a split pair my first inclination would be to suspect the cable tester is flawed.\n\nI would try disconnecting and reconnecting the cable to the tester, perhaps wiggling it to make sure it's making good contact.  Then try testing another known good cable.  Only then would I return the cable.",

The LEDs illuminate first to indicate which pair is being tested, then illuminate again to indicate the result. It also tests wires in pairs instead of individually (i.e. 1-2, then 3-4 and so on).\n\nThis is different than the usual budget tester where both transmitter and receiver have LEDs that illuminate in sequence one wire at a time.\n\nThe split pair indication doesn't seem particularly informative. The example provided in the manual only indicates one pair that is split, not two pairs.",
