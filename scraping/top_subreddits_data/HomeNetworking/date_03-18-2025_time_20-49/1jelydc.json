    "selftext": "Hello  \nThis is my first post here, I am sorry if I was not supposed to post a question on that manner around here or something, but I am completely lost on the problem I am having.\n\nSo  \nFor the last 2 years I have been using a CAT6 cable with no problem, getting around 300mb internet or so. But a few days ago, my internet started going absolutely horrible connection, not going over 10mb. I tried everything to fix the problem, but it didn't work. So I figured out that the problem might be the CAT6 cable.\n\nI then switched it for a spare CAT5E I had. And boom, internet weirdly enough went 2x times better than it was before with the CAT6. Problem fixed, but I was getting random oscilations and high ping.\n\nSo I bought a CAT7, went to test it now, guess what, internet can't go over 10Mb again!\n\nAny ideas what this might be?",
