    "selftext": "So I'll keep things simple, my provider is Xfinity, and I am forced to use the app. For a year I was able to host game servers via port forwarding just fine then once mid January hit, I was unable to host anymore. I have tried many options, I have refreshed the router, I have deleted all ports, tried UDP/TCP, allowing inbound/outbound rules on my firewall, nothing is working for it.\n\nI have NOT tried factory resetting the router as the internet is not under my own name, I set it up and everything but I don't remember how I did it. I also have not called the provider because when speaking to assistance from personal experience, especially over simple things, can be very troublesome.\n\nI am just uncertain what I had done to have broken the port forwards. Any help is greatly appreciated and I'll provide anything needed to help get this situation sorted!  \nThank you so much in advance!!",

I have XFinity and I have my own modem and my own router that I can configure with whatever tools my router supports (it happens I have an Eero which only uses an app, but my previous netgear could be configured with an app or a web page). If you're using XFinity hardware, you're probably also paying them a monthly fee which after a year or two is more than the cost of your own device.",
