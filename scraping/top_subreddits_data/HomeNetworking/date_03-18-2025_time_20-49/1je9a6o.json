    "selftext": "The disclaimer: I know extremely little about home networking! \n\nI'm trying to think about what I'll need to outfit our new house with in terms of ethernet wire and I think I have a decent idea of what we need. The mile high overview of the network is:\n\nONT --> switch\n\nSwitch --> PoE APs in basement/1st floor/2nd floor\n\nSwitch --> various rooms \n\nSwitch --> PoE doorbell & cameras\n\nAll in all I think I'll need about 48 runs. What I'm struggling with is how best to manage the wires. Should I use a patch panel as well as the switch? It seems redundant to me, but I don't know what I don't know. \n\nI'm also toying around with the idea of doing a single home run per floor such that each floor has its own switch. Does that make sense?\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "body": "you typically want to use solid copper for long runs, but the down side is that solid copper shouldn't really be moved or bent tightly. meaning that you dont really want to be plugging it into devices directly. \n\nthe idea is that you go from solid copper to a patch panel or wall jack. and then regular, flexible stranded patch cords from there to the device. \n\nusing patch panels also creates a clear seperation between structured cabling and things you can and might remove from time to time.",

But if you terminate, then plug in the cameras and then dont move them after that, you should be OK.",

Termination is the word used for the point where the cable stops at a connector, whether it is a jack or a plug. When you terminate your home runs to a patch panel, the cable is generally left alone. No one is tugging on it or repeatedly unplugging/plugging it.\n\nWhen you terminate your home runs to plugs, they get tugged on and moved around every time you have to mess with your equipment. That might not be all that frequent, but it's more frequent than if you used a patch panel.\n\nTermination failures are the #1 cause of physical media failures. I've spent hours chasing down bad terminations, and in large installations, you end up with a literal list of bad terminations that you just don't have the time / budget to fix, so you simply put them out of service until you're forced to do something.\n\nAvoid these headaches by terminating all your home runs to a patch panel, and buy patch cables of the appropriate length for all of your equipment. The end result will be a tidy install that is more durable and will give you fewer issues in the long run.",

The small plastic locking piece on the male connector breaks more often than not, which makes the connection between the male and female connector at best unreliable.\nAnd to replace it would mean losing a few centimeters/inches of the cable length. That would eventually not be good with permanently routed cables. \nBut if a short patch cable between the panel and the switch breaks it's easy and inexpensive to replace. The same reason makes med advocate using female outlets through out the building as well.\n\nAnother reason - if you should do the wiring and mounting the connectors yourself is that its much easier to do the female connectors. I prefer the toolless ones my self, but the ones with punchblocks ar also simple to work with and easy to get right.\n\nThe male connectors tend to be mor tricky.\n\nThats my 5 cents to the discussio .\nGood luck with what ever solution you choose\n/Jonas \"SweJob\" Bergstedt",

The two main culprits that result in cables needing to be replaced are wear-and-tear and electricity / power surges. Structured cabling puts that risk on a short cable that's easily replaced so you're less likely to take damage to a long cable in the ceiling/attic that's hard to replace.\n\nAdd to that, if you're gonna have a cable melt and potentially start a fire would you rather have it in the interior of your house where it sets off a smoke alarm, or would you rather not detect it until it catches insulation on fire and becomes an open flame?",

By using copper patch panels, you can maintain the integrity of the cabling and avoid physical damage or unnecessary wear and tear on the copper cables. Proper cable management also helps to minimize interference or degradation of signal quality. Best industry practice is to use a patch panel at one end and a data jack at the other.",
