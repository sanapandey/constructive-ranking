    "selftext": "Recent swapped from one internet provider to another, the new provider is meant to be slightly slower but the speed decrease is far greater than it should be.\nPreviously i paid for gigabit and got a link speed of 1201Mbps and the network band thing said 5GHz, new internet is 866Mbps but my download speeds have gone down from like 50MBps to 4MBps on the new one? Havent changed anything on the pc I use the internet on? Any recomendations to try and fix this?",
