I have a TPL VX 420 modem which is connected to an NBN box to give me a HFC connection to the internet, which up until the last week has been working fine. However, I have changed ISP a week ago from dodo to origin and now am having all sorts of difficulties establishing a stable internet connection. I have been avidly reading and trying to troubleshoot since the problem started and understand I may need to configure my modem to work with my new ISP but am unsure as to where to find the settings I need to change, although I can log on successfully to the admin page of the TPL modem....is there anyone that could pleaseeeee assist me as tech support from new ISP is being less than helpful as they didn't supply the modem and it's now ostarting to do my head in lol..Ive tried all the initial suggestions in troubleshooting houses such as disconnecting power to both the modem and NBN box, checking cables , checking for local outages etc and helpful suggestions at this stage would be more than appreciated...\ud83d\ude42",
