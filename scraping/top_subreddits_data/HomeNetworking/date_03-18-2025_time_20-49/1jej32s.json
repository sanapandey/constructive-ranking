    "selftext": "For three years now, I have been rocking a Unifi setup, and I have had a mixed experience.\n\nSmall backstory:\n\n* I live in Germany and never much cared about my network setup since the local AVM Fritzbox was bundled with every contract, and they were all around. They were, and still are, quite ugly, but they worked reliably. \n* Then, my Google Fan Boy phase kicked in, and I got myself an \"upgrade\": Google WiFi (Gen 1). They were presentable and had a nice interface to manage them, but they lacked some advanced management features I had on the AVM machines.\n* A friend always talked great about Unifi and how they have great devices. He rarely praises big corp tech, so I researched a bit, and it seemed daunting. I gave in and bought a few Unifi things here, primarily secondhand, to test things. That's when I got kind of trapped...\n\nSomething was always lacking, so I upgraded to the better option to solve the problem, but the number of the issues never really went away. \n\nThere was always some kind of weird problem present. For example, some IoT devices couldn't communicate via 2.4 GHz due to faulty firmware, or the express gateway dashboard was constantly unreachable and had to be restarted to get to the settings until it got stuck somewhere again. I got myself a new U7 to try out WiFi 7, but 6GHz drops the moment I look at the AP the wrong way with all my devices. And now, the best part is that my WiFi is always unstable. Random dropouts on my phone, laptop, and steamdeck take my devices offline, ranging from a few seconds to a minute.\n\nMy frustration was even bigger when I visited my parents for two weeks: I gifted them my Google WiFi setup, and that thing runs rock solid to this day! There are no dropouts, and I have a good and stable connection throughout the house, even when I jump over two devices via wireless mesh.\n\nWhile the Nest Wi-Fi setup is daunting, I still do not like the app-driven control of the setup. I would prefer a web UI where I can control everything, even from my laptop.  \nWhile not mandatory, having a system with a built-in modem would be great to lessen the clutter.  \nHaving some features like encrypted DNS, DynDNS, and Mesh would be important to me, but advanced features like smart traffic blocking, traffic analyzing, and other stuff, which Unifi promotes, are not really important to me, especially since most things are turned off...\n\nI was thinking of switching back to AVM, especially the 5690 Pro, which looks quite good and would cover all my needs now. But a friend of mine (not the aforementioned one) said the Wi-Fi sometimes behaved weirdly. He is pretty nitpicky, so such stuff wouldn't probably bother me much. And to be honest, I would be surprised if it got much worse than the current situation.\n\nDo you guys have any suggestions or tips and tricks on choosing the proper setup for me now? I just want a stable network and some slightly advanced features, but definitely nothing super-expert!",

I have avoided wireless backhaul systems and changing systems can often mean new install locations given coverage differences.\n\nSome Asus routers can run Merlin which is nice, but I don\u2019t care for their AIMesh.\u00a0\n\nI also require modern fast handoff as I love in a 2 story home with a basement.",

            "body": "Honestly, it sounds like you will be disappointed with all options as nothing will give you everything you want. The best way is to select individual pieces and build a network with self-hosted services to get done what you want, but you sound like you still need the package tied together with a UI bow. Unfortunately, you will not get that with professional grade networking devices as they are usually lean, mean, and CLI based. Mikrotik is not your speed as it is not as intuitive. Firewalla, OPNsense, etc, are really step downs from Unifi with less capability. \n\nI would post about your issues in the r/unifi or r/ubiquity subs as they can probably help you overcome some of those issues. When you get past the consumer grade systems like you did, things don't just work out of the box. It takes some tweaking and learning to optimize your network. With more power comes more responsibility.",

I ended up going from Ubiquity Edgerouter... then tried their unifi routers but felt it was a step backward from EdgeOS and ended up with Mikrotik. But I was looking more for feature/price v. UI. I do use Unifi for my APs. I also manage Unifi routers for some of my extended family as it fits the bill for them and easy for me to manage remotely.",
