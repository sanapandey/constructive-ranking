    "selftext": "Area is quite remote. Our local telco only has copper \u201cplain old telephone wire\u201d service in the area and the local cableco has fiber but says it doesn\u2019t go to where this utility pole is. It was covered with a metal box but someone struck it with a vehicle, exposing this. If it\u2019s fiber from the cableco, I would be so happy since I have really bad internet options here!\n\nPS: no I did not remove the metal casing. A drunk contractor did this a couple years ago \u2014 but that\u2019s a whole other story. ",

In my neighborhood, there are overhead copper lines that get blown down in storms and AT&T just leaves them blocking the road or sidewalk. Drives me crazy.",
