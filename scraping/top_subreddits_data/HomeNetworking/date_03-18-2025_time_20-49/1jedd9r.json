    "selftext": "I have 1G cable internet from my ISP. Their cable runs straight to my modem. Modem is connected to a Ubiquiti ER4, then into a TP-Link gig switch. CAT6 from the switch to a goCoax MA2500D adapter, then coax from there into an Amphenol ABS318H 8-way splitter. Then coax to the other 5 goCoax adapters in the house. No more splitters are involved. There is a filter on the IN port of the 8-way splitter.\n\nOne the PC that is connected to the switch by CAT6 (no coax involved), I get \\~750Mbps download from the ISP. But any device which has a goCoax adapter in the stream only pulls around 250Mbps. If I run a LAN speed test between devices that have a goCoax adapter in the stream, I also get transfer rates in the mid 200's. So I'm not getting anywhere near the gig speed my switches are capable of. File transfer speeds between devices that are CAT6 connected only are in the 900 range, which is expected. So the MoCA system is the bottleneck. It \\*could\\* be the coax wiring. This house was built in the early 90's, so the coax cable is 30 years old. Replacing it is out of the question. Although re-terminating the ends is possible.\n\nBut before I do that, I'm wondering if connecting to each of the MoCA adapters and tweaking the settings would have an appreciable effect. I've looked for tutorials on the settings, but most seem to be just basic setup. Does anyone now of a site or YouTube vid that actually looks at the settings and suggests improvements?",
