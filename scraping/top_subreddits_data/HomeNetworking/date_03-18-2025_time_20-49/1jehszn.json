    "selftext": "Started having random disconnects lately (lastly 60 sec) but trying to understand why. Not sure where to start. Can my tplink router logs tell me much? It's harder because I have like 100 devices and lots of servers running (home assistant for example is constantly sending data) so I guess km a bit stuck of how to really check this since I have a home grade router. Any guides or help is appreciated ",
