My online backup has always been there for me to get my data back.",

            "body": "Story time, then !\n\nIn March of 2021, some of you might recall that an OVH datacenter burned almost entirely.  \nBack then, I was working on a small Minecraft server with friends. Nothing huge, but we still held games multiple times a week.\n\nAs you can imagine, the server we were renting was in said datacenter. Although not everything was perfect in our technical approach, we had also taken the OVH backup option. Just to be extra safe. What could possibly go wrong ?  \nWell, you guessed it, the backup was lost too ! We were devastated. Most of our work was lost, and it felt so unfair ! We tried to play by the book, and still lost !\n\nAnd then, suddenly, a miracle. One of our system admin had set up a backup on an external pc. It was a weekly backup, so we didn't get everything back, but most of it was saved ! I don't know if he feared such a situation, or if it was just luck, but we learned our lesson : do not store backups in the same physical location. Even if it isn't the same server.",

            "body": "I wish I had some strong wisdom to share with everyone but this is somewhat new to me. I will say this, whatever amount of storage you think is going to be enough, you are wrong, lol. I started with 10tb, then added 14tb, and now am looking at having to expand further. Much like how long lost family and friends show up to your door when you win the lottery, digital files will begin to appear out of nowhere when you suddenly have tens of terabytes to use. Don't find yourself needing to upgrade the week after you first get fully set up, and make sure to include some redundancies in your NAS. This is from a first year NAS operator.",
