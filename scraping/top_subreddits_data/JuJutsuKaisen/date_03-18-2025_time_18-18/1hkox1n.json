But they do reinforce the ending that the characters are now back to doing regular jujutsu sorcerer stuff. I also guess the epilogue implies a more peaceful world with the characters having time to live their lives. A \"normal\" life is a nice reward for everything everyone went through.",

Actually it was so obvious that it could happen that the author supposedly killed the characters that could make that ending a lot of time before. Was nice, tho. A little bit rush at the end, but, a nice ending anyways.\n\n\nI confess that what pissed me a lil bit was the prologue. I really was expecting something more concrete about megumi and what happened with the jujutsu world without gojou...

Beyond acknowledging the Shibuya and culling game incidents... this was just, okay? \n* Kind of fucked up Panda is just slowly dying in a closet, periodically alive, like a discarded toy. If Yuta is really the head of the Gojo Clan now, presumably with Maki, then I have a hard time imagining how they're both okay with their former teammate/friend being left like this. Like, what the fuck? Also, why go so far in the future? Why not show Yuta and Maki presumably get together, how Yuta became head of the Gojo  or something with Panda resigning to his decaying condition? \n* Honestly, I didn't get much from the Nobara epilogue. She had been gone for so long, I didn't remember shit about her deadbeat mother to really give a shit one way or the other about this confrontation. \n* The Uraume and Sukuna bit was definitely the best of the four despite being a flashback. This would have been better placed during the actual story. \n\nI appreciate the additional content, but beyond feeling terrible for Panda and the interesting Uraume flashback, I don't really get anything from this. Plus, I reckon there were other things that readers would have rather seen than any of this tbh. It is what it is though, I guess. Honestly, I'm more concerned about Akutami's lack of confidence, burnout, and overall mental health. The translation I read was pretty choppy, but he sounded exhausted, exasperated, and just done with this story. Here's hoping he's able to recuperate, reflect, and able to put his best foot forward for whatever else he works on.",

It doesn't even have the change that was suggested to add Non Heroes it's still only heroes.\n\n430 has Deku passing on the torch and telling someone they too can be a hero but in his own way, analysing their quirk and giving advice.

I always suspected that he has ADHD or something due to his weird antics, interviews and overall messy writing style and not really being able to properly plan his story or focus on fundamental story aspects. I\u2019ll probably never want to read anything from him but for his (mental) sake, I hope he stops being a mangaka on a weekly shonen shedule, as he clearly never really was up to all the stress and expectations which comes with it. He should probably continue writing shot stories in the future, as these were the moments where he could really shine as an author.\u00a0",
