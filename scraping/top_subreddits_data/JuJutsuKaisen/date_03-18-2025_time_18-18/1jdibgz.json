But I think that might have been from improvement in Gege\u2019s art style between HI and Shibuya Arc as zombie Toji also looks pretty good (but not as good as Mappa did with him especially in the Blu-Ray \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd75).",

I love it. Even if the ending of the manga has this rough rushed style, my unpopular opinion is that I'm kinda fond of it, it has its flaws but it what it makes it unique and I just connected with it I guess hahhaha",

There are so many panels that are really phenomenal throughout the series and I\u2019ve tried to recreate some of them myself.\n\nBtw, I got a couple of the limited edition blu-rays mostly for the Toji and Nanami posters but the English release of the Shibuya Incident is coming out, I\u2019m supposed to get it tomorrow.",
