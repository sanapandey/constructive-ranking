I think when kusakabe talks about it being a better version of SD (I\u2019m not sure what the raw translations say), I think he\u2019s referring to it being a more advanced barrier technique built off of SD, not necessarily a more effective anti domain technique. I think the biggest evidence honestly is Sukuna using HWB instead of domain amp to defend from sure hits. There\u2019s a chance that domain amp could help defend against them, but it would be less effective than just using the technique it\u2019s derived from that is solely for domains. It looks like it could be the result of a sort of binding vow in the sense that it trades off things from hwb/SD in exchange for its effects. We can sort of see the difference between SD and HWB in this regard with HWB basically being useless outside of domains, but likely being stronger against sure hits (I don\u2019t believe for a second Sukuna wouldn\u2019t be able to copy SD like Yuki did and use it instead of HWB unless there was some form of tradeoff). SD on the other hand has extensive use outside of domains, but is likely weaker against surehits in exchange. Even their shape seems to suggest hwb would be sturdier since it\u2019s a woven spherical shape whereas simple domain only appears visible on the ground and seems to sort of peel apart when clashing with domains. Domain amp is likely the next step with it losing more effectiveness against sure hits, but gaining even more utility outside of them and leaning more into aspects that are normally not as practical with SD such as interfering with the domain inside one\u2019s body and in turn disrupting their CT (see mechamaru vs mahito).",

He's not affected by having his hands stuck in a handsign because he has four arms. \n\nDomain Amplification disrupting someone's technique like Mahito vs Mechamaru just doesn't work due to how that encounter happened. Mechamaru very specifically stuck simple domain inside Mahito and activated it, and we know that the inside of the body counts as somebody's inner domain (It's why Sukuna can't slash Gojo's brain to bits for example, he can't spawn the slashes inside of Gojo, only on top of him.) \n\nAll of the Domain Techniques work by putting up a barrier that absorbs an enemy's technique.\n\nI do agree that Domain Amplification is more useful as utility in that it's an offensive AND a defensive technique, compared to the other domain techniques being purely defensive.",

The only positive is that the domain won't overwhelm it, but it doesn't work against a lot of sure hits. Against MS, the person still gets hit and if they don't have RCT, they'll just die from the slashes, making the technique useless and it doesn\u2019t even work against sure hits like UV. It can be used for combat outside domains, but that hasn't really been shown.\n\nHWB is said to be the prototype to SD. Maybe it's not as effective against domains, but that's just speculation from me. Its handsign isn't hard to maintain, which is a plus. There hasn't been any mention of it being able to be used outside combat and Reggie, Sukuna or Kashimo never used it in fights, so it's likely that it's only able to be used against domains.\n\nSD has a lot of positives. It raises the output of sorcerers and weakens attacks. It can be programmed, like Miyo making it about sumo or Kusakabe's own creation of intercepting things that are in its range, making it quite versatile. It's also part of the New Shadow Style, which has a bunch of techniques. Just as a technique, it's already the best. But it also functions as an anti domain technique. Both HWB and SD will eventually get overwhelmed against domains, but working against all sure hits is better than FBE not having this disadvantage. The only downside is probably the stance to activate it.\n\nSD is the best anti domain technique, although HWB is a close second and for Sukuna, it is the better option. FBE is the worst anti domain technique.\n\nLooking at it combat wise, I think SD is still the best, after that DA, then FBE and lastly, HWB.",

Normal cursed techniques (like barriers or normal shikigamis) cannot be imbued in a domain so they thus cannot be negated by domain amplification.\n\nThe fanbook does put domain amplification as an anto domain technique, and it isn't hard to see why. The sure hit is an application of an innate cursed technique, so it will get imbued into domain amplification and nullified. \n\nHowever, it would pose the same issue as falling blossom emotion. While it cannot be be collapsed by the domain expansion like sd or hwb can, it also won't fully nullify the sure hit. Above a certain output threshold, the sure hit will seep in and hit the caster. Considering that sukuna wasn't able to fully nullify gojo's blue and red, that threshold isn't that high so domain amplification isn't that useful as a domain counter (gojo's fbe was able to make cleaves into papr cuts so it seems like it has a higher threshold than domain amplification does).\n\nHowever, the main issue with domain amplification is that it prevents you from using your innate ct. This isn't the case for anti domain techniques such as fbe, sd and hwb, so they allow you to better fight. \n\nIn a way, that's the beauty of how gege designed the anti domain techniques. Each one has different mechanism through which they nullify the sure hit, and each one has advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the situation and the user, any one of them could be the optimal one, and any one of them could be the worst one (continuation in the replies)",

This means that the user is in a clash with the domain caster, the sure hit not being able to be activated until the clash is resolved. Therefore, the sure hit is fully nullified but the anri domain technique will quickly be collapsed by the clash.\n\nBy maintaining the activation ritual (stance for sd and handsign for hwb) you can increase the output of the anti domain techniques and therefore make it last longer or indefinitely.\n\n**2. Fbe**\n\nThis works by enveloping yourself with a sheet of curse energy, and programming it so that when the sure hit materializes on you, it is attacks by the curse energy in a discharge. This has the benefit of not being able to be collapsed due to not being in a clash, but it has the downsides of only working on physical sure hits and it also has a threshold on the output due to the limit of the user's curse energy output compared to the output of the sure hit\n\n**3. Da**\n\nI already talked about it.\n\n.\n\nSukuna's best use is hwb as he has 4 arms, so him using 2 hands to maintain the handsign isn't a big downside. However, that is a pretty bad case for most sorcerers as they need their arms to properly fight.\n\nIn general, if the sure hit is conceptual (like uv or idle transfiguration) fbe is useless. However, if the sure hit is physical (like ms) then fbe might be your best option.\n\nGojo used used fbe on ms, while the crew learned sd to counter it. They both actually used the best technique for the situation. The crew was planning on todo teleporting them out, so they only needed to last for a bit (except it didn't work and choso and yuji were screwed). Therefore, sd or hwb would be the best option as they can fully stop the sure hit for a short time\n\nFbe was the best option for gojo as he wasn't going to get bailed out by anybody. Fbe heavily minimizes the sure hit of ms, so gojo is free to use rct on his brain and get his ct back. Something like this wouldn't have worked for the crew as miwa and ino would have been killed by the sure hit even if it was reduced in output by fbe.\n\nDa would work the best in a situation where you are already in ct burn out so you wouldn't be able to use your ct anyway, and when you can afford some of the sure hit seeping in.",
