    "selftext": "# Anime Questions Thread\n\n**All manga spoiler questions should be redirected to the MANGA Questions Thread crossposted from** r/Jujutsushi **each week.** ***This thread is anime-only.*** **Manga spoilers will be removed.**\n\n## FAQs\n\n# What chapter should I start reading the manga at?\n\n>The anime leaves off at Chapter 63, or the start of Volume 8.\n\n# Where can I read JJK?\n\n>If buying physical copies isn't an option...  \n>  \n>Officially: [**Shueisha**](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100034) \\- Only the first three chapters and the most recent 3 chapters are available. New chapters are released every Sunday at around 10 PM MST (UTC-7). [**Viz Media**](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/jujutsu-kaisen?locale=en) \\- Only the first three and most recent 3 chapters are available for free, but for $2 a month, you can read the entire series (and every series on their site), including Volume 0, Jujutsu Kaisen's Prequel. New chapters are also released on the same day and time as on the Shueisha site.  \n>  \n>Unofficially, Google \"read Jujutsu Kaisen free\" and make sure you have an adblocker installed.\n\n# What is the movie about?\n\n>It covers Volume 0, a one-shot prequel that Gege wrote before writing the main series of Jujtusu Kaisen. Yuta Okkotsu is the main character and it the story takes place 1 year prior to the main series.\n\n# Should I read Volume 0? And when?\n\n>You can read it whenever you like, but Chapter 63 is a good point to read it. It explains some of the events and motivations that happen in the JJK storyline.\n\n# Where can I watch the anime and movie?\n\n>Legally on Crunchyroll. We unfortunately have to keep links to aggregate sites off of the sub or risk it being flagged for takedown. Otherwise, try Googling \"where to watch anime free reddit\".\n\n# Which chapters correspond to which episode?\n\n>u/HououinKyoma23 created an amazing guide that covers every episode:chapter in the series!

In shibuya, however, kenjaku had 3 objectives. \n\n1. Seal away satoru gojo. This is the most important one since the entire thing was for this.\n2. Steal the evolved form of idle transfiguration from mahito. This was secondary since he can do this whenever it just worked out that mahito evolved his technique during this time. The technique he stole is a 1 time use of idle transfiguration.\n3. Give sukuna the fingers. This is 3rd on the list since sukuna can sense his fingers, and he can even track them down himself, so not really important.",

There's 2 ways he modified people. 1 group was like Junpei, they were born with a cursed technique but weren't able to use CE. Essentially, they had the software, but not the hardware. The other group was fed Cursed Objects and fake Geto modified them into beimg vessels, which means the cursed objects will incarnate, taking over the person. Like in season 1, when Mahito fed a person a Death Painting Womb and that person turned into Kechizu.",
