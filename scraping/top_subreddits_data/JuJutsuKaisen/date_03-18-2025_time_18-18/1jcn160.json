    "selftext": "Gojo is the only character that only needs one hand for his Domain Expansion, at least from the characters we get to see. \n\nEven Sukuna went to some lengths to give himself an extra pair of arms so he could expand his domain while still having an extra pair of hands free. \n\nWhen Yuta does domain expansion, his hands aren\u2019t touching, but they are both still clearly being used. \n\nAt first, I thought Gojo\u2019s second hand being at his side was required for him to expand his domain. But he does it against his fight with Jogo while holding Yuji in his other hand, so that doesn\u2019t seem to be true. So could he theoretically fight with one hand while doing it? Are some people just inexplicably lucky, and their domains only require one hand? Is it a Gojo family secret?",

YOU JUST GET BORN WITH RANDOM BS QUIRK and only can train it. Although you can get one by ingesting their DNA, so CONSUME like in JJK i guess... or steal.\n\nThe only way to GAIN CTs is to CONSUME or BE CONSUMED like how Yuji, Sukuna and Yuta /w Rika do. And BVs operate like coupled sliders - you gain something by giving something up. It's also reversible, but if you want too much right now and can't give much in return, it becomes irreversible.\n\nThe only exception to this is Mahito - he can give anyone an ability to use CE or even a CT if he knows how it works. \n\nSukuna is a jujutsu prodigy, the only ones who could come even close with the use of Binding Vows are Satoru FREAKING Gojo and maybe Mahito if he didn't die.",

Gojo domain is so busted he doesn't need to waste alot of energy on making sure it sure hits all of his ct effects .\n\nfor example it doesn't apply his neutral infinity to everything in his domain. Otherwise you'd be crushed instantly like hanami and the wall.  Or in sukuna case it made his domain time limit based, rather then the usual stamina based. that is why he was able to start off in burnout to begin healing naturally rather then use the forced regen of rct.",

True. But rather than it being to defend himself while using the domain hand signs, it's more so to defend himself so he can make that \u200bhandsign in the first place. Like in 261 when yuji attacks him and sukuna holds him down with one hand while making domain handsign with the other. I wouldn't call it outright fighting though.\n\n\\>thought I read that, and that he gave himself a second mouth so he could always be chanting without interruption as well\n\nThis part is also true.\n\nWhat I'm really trying to say, is gojo using one handsign or two to activate a domain doesn't really matter. Because Domain's activate so quickly (especially his) and you don't need to keep holding the same handsign for it to stay active.\n\nOne handed signs are at best good if you don't have rct and you lose one of your arms.",

This ties back into what Kusakabe says during gojo vs sukuna where he talks about the parameters of domain barriers and such often being preset which is why it is often so difficult for sorcerers to even learn DE let alone start changing parameters. It took 4 bf\u2019s from Sukuna to rewire his brain to state where he could do the one handed hand sign and recover his domain. As for why it\u2019s the exact same one as Gojo, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s just imitating Gojo as he\u2019s not only seen him do the handsign, but also seen him rewire his brain for RCT with 2 bf\u2019s. The handsign seems to \u201cunique\u201d to the sorcerer/body rather than the CT itself evidenced by Yuji having a different one than Sukuna (though he is a weird case since he has 2 innate CTs without being an incarnated sorcerer) and Yuta using Gojo\u2019s handsign for UV when he bodyhops.",
