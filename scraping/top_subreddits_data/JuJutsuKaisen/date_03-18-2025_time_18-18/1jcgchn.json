Do you think people will understand that the surplus of fights is the vehicle of his story telling or just be wowed by the animation, believing it's nothing but fists thrown and spectacle.   \n  \nAnd if the former, what fight do you guys need to be done justice to and what moment do you think will become the fan favorite and break the internet! I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts.",

The animanga fanbase right now is insufferable and whenever any popular new gen anime comes out, everyone loves it, the animation, etc but usually there is a great switch down the line where everyone just starts following a trend of hating. Same thing happens to music albums. Jujutsu kaisen is going to be extremly hated no matter what in the future",

Naruto, Bleach, Tokyo Ghoul, AOT, Fire Force,  and so on received similar amounts of hate only for everyone to switch up on it including the people who overly criticised them when the anime came out is common. Its a constant cycle basically",

So I can actually see them changing this for the anime, since Gege usually works with animators and production crew to clarify and approve things here and there. If they can fix that part the rest of the games should be enjoyable for the anime crowd since the main complaint about jjk is that it's too confusing.",

More manga readers were hyping the season.\nThe CG are worse with fewer characters most people care for.\n\nBut I think Mappa cares more for the home market.\nSo not sure how most Japanese fans see it. \n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Movie release of HI will be more successful than the 3rd Season.\nI also wonder which character will get merch, right now Nobara, Gojo and (adult) Nanami get merch, despite what happened to them in Shibuya.\n\nI had to force myself through the CG Arc and regret that I bought the manga.
