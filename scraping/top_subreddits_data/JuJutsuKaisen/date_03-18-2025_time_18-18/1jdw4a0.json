    "selftext": "Looking at Gojo's usage of limitless, I believe there is much more he could have done that would have resulted in fewer issues in the manga.\n\n\nIn, shibuya or Shinjuku:\n\nAfter hidden inventory, he was working on using multiple reds and blues at a time. I doubt he would not be able to do it after an extra decade of working on it. This is Gojo, not Geto with RCT.\n\nMoving forward, could he not have used multiple blues to restrain all limbs and hold an opponent still, or maybe even rip them in 5 pieces. It would have finished the disaster curses with the exception being mahito, and then Gojo would only need to worry about the transfigured humans.\nIt would throw off Kenjaku's plan as well since his timing would then be off. Leading to Gojo not being sealed and him joining in to Jump Uraume and Kenjaku.\n\n This also would have helped with Sukuna and a pre adapted Mahoraga.\n\nHad he this to sukuna in Shinjuku, he could have landed more hits, and possibly more black flashes, further shifting the tide of battle and making Sukuna transform earlier. Gojo would likely still die, but the chain reaction could cause Kashimo to reconsider jumping in as he did. Kashimo's extra firepower would help the squad big time, or he could have helped Hakari stall uraume. \n\nUsing science gojo could have reached even higher speeds using red and blue to narrow distance ahead of him while enhancing it behind him.\n\nHonestly I believe many JJK character could have been more powerful if they understood science.... Especially Jogo.\n\n",

And when it came to the disaster curses, he was really enjoying himself torturing them.\n\nSo it's probably that Gojo just like to scrap. \n\nAlso, Gojo DOES use blue when he's hand to hand fighting. He uses blue to suck his opponents into his blows. Yuta and Hakari experienced this and said they immediately collapsed and threw up after 1 blow from a blue enhanced punch from Gojo",

But he'll throw everything at them if his life is ever in danger....but I believe It was already explained that he couldn't use his CT because of the normies in shibuya.\n\nAgainst Sukuna, tbh I doubt it would work. also he didn't want to show Sukuna everything he has. Also Maho's adaptation. Yes he can do it but the only reason I can think of that would be why he would spam multiple blues and multiple reds would be to spam unlimited hollows. But this means megumi goes bye bye. Which is fundamentally against Gojo's character. Remember this is a guy who... probably the first thing he asked right out of the box was if the civilians in shibuya were okay? He talks tough but it really bothers him when innocents catch strays.\nAll this plus a tiny bit of plot induced stupidity.",

After the domain wars the ONLY reason Sukuna wasn't constantly using DA was to not interfere with Maho's adaptation meaning if it weren't for Maho he would still be using DA to weaken all of Gojo's blues and reds which even without DA are NOT enough to significantly injure him unless they're combo'd with Gojo's physical attacks.\nYou say Sukuna couldn't do anything about the blue spams is you yet again misunderstanding the fight as at that point Sukuna was purposefully on the defensive to give Maho time to adapt. I don't know where you got the idea that he was helpless against the blues seeing as he was literally dodging like 99% of them.\nAnd once again you Gojo was forced to detonate a hp on top of himself as he had no other way of getting one off against Mahoraga and Sukuna(who again wasn't using DA and so could only touch Gojo when Maho turned his infinity off) and this was after lucking out and restoring his output with multiples black flashes.
