Making him a character who can very easily slide into cruelty, lives for the fight, and yet he has a bleeding heart for a select few which decimated his past apathy,,,, makes him so much more interesting. Plus all the symbolism with Buddhist philosophy and how it plays out in his life? chef's kiss",

(he says) He chose to live out of cowardice, he chose to live because he didn't want to die. His heroic reasoning was just a rationalization.  \nHowever, as audience members, it is easy for us to see that this isn't truly his fault. We can also see that Yuji is genuinely heroic and will gladly put himself in harms way in order to help anyone.  \nThis is a very human characteristic, where our self-doubt takes over and we easily dismiss our altruistic deeds for the more easily understood, selfish desires.\n\n  \nPlus he tanks brutal damage and his fights are always badass as he is an underdog that has to figure out how to beat stronger opponents with just his fists.",

Ultimately I think it all boils down to personal preference and who resonates more with you. I think Gojo is better simply because I love the powerhouse archetype, which is also why I love Todo (or Todou? I\u2019m not sure), as soon as you see them, you know things will go better",
