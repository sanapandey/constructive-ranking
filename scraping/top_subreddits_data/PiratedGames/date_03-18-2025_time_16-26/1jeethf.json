    "selftext": "So I made a post yesterday and learned how to use the Fucking Fast DDL on FitGirl repack because someone started a dm with me and helped me for hours, thanks to him. But in the first video he sent me of him doing it, when he copied the links and JDownloader2 opened, the pop-up on the right side only took like 1 second and he had the links in LinkGrabber. However, when I copied the links, the JDownloader2 pop-up did show but it said Online: 0 and the status said \"Onlinecheck...\" for a really long time. Eventually we settled on steamrip but thats a pain in the ass because it takes so much storage and is slow asf. A community post on JDownloader2 asked about something similar and a mod said to change InternetConnectionPreference blah blah blah to IPV4\\_IPV6 then restard JDownloader2. I did that and now at this moment, its still doing it, and its a different game this time, so its not the game. Basically it sits there checking them for SOOOOO long and the parts are gradually added when its done checking them, but this literally takes so long and the guy who helped me didn't know why it was like this as for him, all links were added to LinkGrabber immediately. Also, we tried using the website URL that had all the DDL's and then paste them into JDownloader2 directly, but it worked once and it only had as many parts that were checked in the earlier process when it was sitting there for like 30 minutes, which was 33 parts and it said none of them were online. CAN SOMEONE PLEASSEEE EXPLAIN???\n\n  \nEdit: Is it possible that the reason it takes forever for me is because I do not have IPV6?",
