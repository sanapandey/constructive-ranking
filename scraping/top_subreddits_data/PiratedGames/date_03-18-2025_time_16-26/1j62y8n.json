We are a small team so please allow for some time before a response can be expected. Constructive community feedback is highly appreciated!\n\nEdit: correction",

Without repackers, everything still work fine. There are dozens of better sites on csrin, people who actually buy the games and participate in the cracking process. Repackers just sit back and wait for those people to do the work. The uneducated people here tend to exaggerate the work of repackers, thinking that it is an important and indispensable job in the process of releasing cracked games, these guys also tend to accept whatever repackers give them lmao.",

But that doesn't mean their work is any less important.\n\nEither way my point still stands, Dodi has never intentionally added \"poison\" to his repacks. The only kinds of websites that will run ads are those sketchy 3rd party stuff. I don't think Google Ads would be too keen on running ads on a website that \"steals\" games.\n\nIf you can't navigate that, then its a skill issue.

When someone asks me about repack, I always suggest Fitgirl, not DODI. Of course I have internet skills, I am also one of the contributors to ublock, the redirects he uses are a bunch of garbage, I have blocked them many times, but a few days later, it is bypassed. Sometimes when I block them strictly, DODI will use another host/domain instead. You know what this behavior is? He intentionally wants users to click and download those damn ads. They are not normal ads like other websites. Recently gamedriver website also has the same behavior, it has been removed from the list of safe sites. While DODI has been doing this for years, people just ignore it on purpose whenever this is mentioned.\n\n\n\n**Admins of websites that don't control the content of ads** are DIFFERENT from **admins of websites that try to get users to download malicious ads**. Those are two completely different concepts. Would you trust someone who tries to get you to download as many malicious ad files as possible?",

I myself have gotten confused on what the hell this is. There might be an excuse for this, like to not get caught by automated web scraping bots for copyright infringement or something.
