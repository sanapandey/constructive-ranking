So they go to their lawyers, the lawyers go to your ISP and then they get your name and address. You subsequently receive a ceise and decist with them asking for about 1k USD per torrented item or you face dealing with that in court and potential jail time.

                            "body": "Idk about Germany and about seeing what files you download is specific to torrents because of trackers iirc. I'm not an expert with these things but I do know anytime someone receives one of those letters from their ISP it's because they downloaded via torrent. I'm pretty sure it's because of the tracking that makes it easy for them to track people.\n\nI've had probably over 20 of those letters over the last 25 years but the last one I received was 15+ years ago and nothing has ever happened. I never used a torrent for over 15 years now.\n\nThe funny thing is that the movie studios and music record labels in the U.S. just brought on a lawsuit against Altice (the one that owns optimum and other ISPs) suing Altice for this exact reason that the letters they send don't do anything because Altice never took any actions against customers who receive these letters LOL They claim Altice never took action against the customers who receive the letters because they don't want to lose that customers business do they're indirectly profiting from pirating lol \n\nBest thing is to just use direct downloads which doesn't require a VPN and then instead of spending money on VPN you can pay for premium subscription to the direct download provider that the place you get links from uses the most to host the files. Your speeds and reliability will be better than torrents as well but that's just me \ud83e\udd37",

            "body": "Heres how pirating works in Canada:\n\nYour internet provider isnt allowed to give out your personal information to the people claiming the violation but they are required to send you notification to stop. Because the complainant doesnt know your personal information it is very important that you dont respond to the notification or they will find out more about you.\n\nIf you get a lot of these notifications then your provider can cut off your service. I have seen a few stories of this hapoening but its rare. \n\nAs far as what can happen to you ill give you worst case scenario but understand this is so highly unlikely to happen. Worst case scenario: you get a $1500 fine. Thats the most you can pay in Canada. Its also not accumalitive so if youve pirated 1 movie or 2000 movies the most you can be fined is $1500 total. Even then most likely it would be far less as $1500 would be reserved for the worst offenders(people that host content)\n\nBasically what happened was this: companies were being formed that would basically act like debt collectors and work on copyright infringements. It was big business as they would go after anyone that downloaded anything and make big fees. It became a money making business more so than protecting intellectual property. Canada didnt like that. They see the danger of someone exploiting people this way so they capped the maximum fine.\n\nSo long story short. Its not worth all the lawyer fees and hassle for at most $1500. They send out notifications hoping you reply so they can get a \"settlement\" out of you by scaring you into paying. \n\nThose tricky bastards then figured out that bundling a lawsuit is more financially viable so they have done mass filings where they will have 1 case but 100 defendants. That way they cut their fees with a bigger pay out. I have actually heard of this happening but rareand in this case you would want to contact a lawyer. But again worst case would be $1500. \n\nBut ya after all that, get a VPN. Its not worth the worry. Lol",
