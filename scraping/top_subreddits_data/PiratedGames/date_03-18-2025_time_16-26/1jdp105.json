Just download the friend pass version from Steam, drop in the DLLs and you can play. Best thing is that instead of using Spacewar like they most of the time do, the online fix for Split Fiction registers as Split Fiction itself which means you can even earn achievements, use cloud saving and all the other stuff Steam provides, all without paying a single cent. While every other company tries to hinder piracy, Steam actively aids people in playing pirated games.",
