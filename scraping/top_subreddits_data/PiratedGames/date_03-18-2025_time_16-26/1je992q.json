Buy the dlc from steam.\n\n2.Download and back up the clean files of dlcs.\n\n3.Use the CreamInstaller to bypass the dlcs.\n\n4.Refund the money from steam.\n\nI\u2019m doing this because some of the steam clean files from cs.rin.ru, the provided links are invalid for me. So, I would like to know if my method is working.\n\nThank you for you time, I\u2019m looking forward for your answers!",

Since I own the game but not the DLC, I can just keep an older game version and not update the DLC files, which is a chore.",
