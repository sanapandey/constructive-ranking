    "selftext": "Hello !\n\nWhen i was young, i downloaded a ton of cracked games and i was serene about it since my computer was basically a play station.\n\nBut now, it's also my life, with a lot of personnal docs in it, and since life is hard, i don't have a lot of money so i want to try the games before buying it.\n\nI just dowloaded a game on SteamRIP, via go files with an adblocker, so i'm pretty sure i downloaded the real file, but i'm still thinking about a few things :\n\n1. I heard that some repackers can add some viruses or bitcoin miner in the game, is it still true ?\n\n2. What do you use to be sure you don't get some shit ? I'm currently using Windows Defender (since i wasn't a pirate for years), but it's maybe too weak i don't know\n\n3. If i download a game from megathread links (here SteamRIP with Brave), do i still need to be paranoid or can i install the game with no worries ?\n\nThanks a lot, fellow pirates \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f",

Also many anti-viruses use the same detection definition as their enterprise solutions, where it makes sense to detect such things to avoid fines but not for the average joe who barely makes ends meet.",

                    "body": "I would not run any AV at all, while you are right about AV companies adding things to their detection definitions, an AV besides using a list of known malware / viruses they scan for behaviour based on the known behaviour definitions lists. I don't know what exactly you use your system for but basically you are vulnerable to literally anything and you have no way of knowing this. An AV will only be able to detect possible malware / viruses if the behaviour pattern is known so while you may even get infected with an AV I would not run a system without it unless you are 100% sure you will never get infected and that is mot possible with a system that is connected to the internet, a network or where you attach external devices to. Basically you may have a false sense of security but that depends on what exactly you do on your system and if it is conmected to a network etc.\n\nYour system could be infected with the most basic malware logging all your key inputs, capturing your screen, even having access to your encrypted data which is only safe as long as there is no vulnerability in that encryption method.\n\nAny software legit or pirated can contain a vulnerability which has not been discovered yet, if your system is connected to the internet or connected to your network but no direct internet access, this is bad advice for anyone especially for the OP.\n\nIt's better to have an AV and use exclusions than having no way of knowing your system is possibly infected at all.",

You don't need much more than that, really, the risk still exists but that's unavoidable, even if you don't pirate and only use official sources the risks of data leaking and stuff like that still exists, so I suggest you backup on cloud storage whatever is important for you and don't overthink too much about it.",
