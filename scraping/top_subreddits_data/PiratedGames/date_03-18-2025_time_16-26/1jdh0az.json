When the download is finished I go on my pc and everything's going weird when I launch the installation. \nThe progression bar is slow as hell. Worse it slower than on my wife PC. \nNormally I never have issue with this so I cancel. Download again, imagining something went wrong with the files. Same atrocious speed. \nI restart my computer, another fail. \nWifey's computer a 77% and I start panicking when after 15 minutes I'm still at 1,9%.\nSo I put this aside, time to eat. We talk about it and she try to help me figure it out. \nMaybe you run out of space, maybe you should try to install it on your external drive. \nAnd epiphany my drive was plug in and have a games folder. \nStupid me didn't pay attention to the installing folder and the game try to install for an unknown reason. \nAnyway it was good fun for my wife to see me panic like this ^^\n",
