It installed all dlcs, but those two that are can be bought repeatedly from steam (crafting materials and stat boost set) crash the game when trying to claim the from the ingame menu\n\nFound version [5.0.0.0](http://5.0.0.0) And there it is stranger. It does list those dlcs as possible options, but after installing them, they are not in game at all. Any help? Wouldn't mind skipping some grind\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwnr7hxrbipe1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=3081734f9048339abb9a96052aa2c9d048356c1d\n\n",
