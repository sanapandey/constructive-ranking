Great for one stop shopping Games, Movies, TV, Music and XXX so easy to use as everything was so organized for a public site. Sad to see them go. They always had the latest scene releases for games and more importantly they hosted game updates and re-releases etc.\n\nFitGirl is probably my current fav for games but again don't game much nowadays. I just buy the games these days and I down games for demoing. Hate direct download sites give me torrents any day. IGG is good example of why.\n\nStreaming or constant online connection will or is killing P2P games. Hell these days most games are indie or budget titles. AAA's are hard to come by or take a really long time.\n\nXXX no probs with those. Have dozens upon dozens of member and public sites. Games I can always buy. XXX? The wife and kids wouldn't like that. And PRON makes games look dirt cheap ; )",

I was playing AC: Valhalla game the pirated version.   \nI love that game personally, just a good lousy time waster and game never ends for me :D.\n\nToday on steam sale I got the complete edition for $26 dollars, I bought it. Now, the question is: I played about 40-50 hours on the pirated version. Is there a way to move the save file over to the steam version of the game as I don't want to start from scratch that game :D.\n\nP.S. I still haven't downloaded the game in steam.",
