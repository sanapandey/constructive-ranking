Just know Amazon has occasionally screwed the pooch and not given you the actual drive you ordered, but something else instead. \n\nYou should also know this is not re-certified by Seagate, but by Amazon.  That may be OK or not OK in your books, that's your decision to make.\n\nIf you want HDD's certified by Seagate, you can buy them here: https://serverpartdeals.com/collections/manufacturer-recertified-drives\n\nI'm not affiliated with them except being a happy customer.",

The SMART tools will claim a very low amount of run hours. But in reality the drives have run far more hours and aren't new at all. When pulling the FARM data the real usage hours come to the surface. You think you are buying a new drive, but it's actually a pre-owned one.",

This means the warranty, goes through the vendor and may be less than the 3 or 5 yrs for nas/server drives. \n\nOverall, very nasty behavior from the spinning rust producers.",
