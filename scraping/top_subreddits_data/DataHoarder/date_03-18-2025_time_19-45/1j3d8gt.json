As the rescue part of the project slows down, there will be efforts to store and catalog data for long-term public access. Please use the submission form to add your data to the project. Thanks!\u00a0[https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/](https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/)",

I've added it to the above tracker, however if folks would like to help back this data up since it only has a few seeds, you can do so via this torrent:\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:da7f54c14ca6ab795ddb9f87b953c3dd8f22fbcd&dn=ftp2\\_census\\_gov\\_2025\\_02\\_17\\_torrents&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.torrentsnipe.info%3A2701%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.heihachi.pw%3A6969%2Fannounce\n\nNote that this is a torrent of torrents, because the total dataset is >6TB and >4M files. Also, due to an error on my part, file 31 is just an empty directory structure.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any trouble getting the data.",

You are WARRIORS, those of you compiling all these files & saving them!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udcbe\ud83e\udd70\n\n\nThough I'm still curious as to how DOGE got into all these agencies with little to no resistance... I mean you just don't waltz right into a government agency & claim that you're in charge - & say you demand the data! It doesn't work this way!! There are rules, regulations, protocols to follow! And especially with Federal offices - well you breach that or burglarize that & guess what YOU get!? HUGE fines & LOTS of prison time, got it???\u00a0\n\n\nI'd like to help with the Social Security, Medicare, HUD, & Census Bureau if there's any left of those. But all I have is my phone. Waiting on a laptop to be sent to me soon .... \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\n\n\nGood luck guys, Happy Paddy's Day \ud83c\udf40\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea Erin Go BRAGH!!!!! \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f",
