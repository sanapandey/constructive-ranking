                                    "body": "In the UK it means tossed in the trash bin, yes.\n\nBut in the electronics industry, it means \"tested and sorted according to some parameter\". It's adjacent to \"matched pairs\" of transistors, or \"dye lots\" in fabric and fiber. Manufacturing variations mean not all products are identical, even if they might not be outright defective. \n\nI first encountered it with LEDs, where LEDs coming off the production line have slight variations and all meet spec, but if you put a bunch of 'em on a wall next to each other, the color might not be perfectly even. So you measure each one and group them: There's a bin of greenish ones, a bin of reddish ones, a bin of bluish ones. Maybe two bins of each color, for slightly brighter and slightly dimmer. And maybe one outer catch-all \"technically produces light but it's so wacky it doesn't fall into any of those bins\" bin. Not defective, just different enough from the others...\n\nSo now a fixture manufacturer can order a reel of A2-bin LEDs and know that they're all so tightly grouped as to be indistinguishable, a smooth wall of uniform light. And an enthusiast building a world-record light can pay a premium for a couple gems from the unusually-high-luminous-efficacy bin. And a cheapskate (or someone producing one-offs who doesn't care about color matching or output as long as it's above the minimum spec) can get the unbinned ones which are probably sold at a discount. \n\nIn the case of hard drives, it's long been a common practice to try to build drives with all good platter surfaces, but if one surface is bad, they don't disassemble the drive and try to remove the bad platter (additional handling would _increase_ risk of further defects), they just mark it as a 7-head drive instead of 8, and sell it as lower capacity. For example. Any number of attributes can result in a product that's still saleable, just not at flagship capacity or performance. \n\nThe question for us, then, is whether it's a perfectly fine drive with 7 good surfaces and the defect is contained to the bad surface, and the overall drive will live as long as any other, or if that defect is a sign of something deeper and it'll likely have a shorter lifespan or otherwise be less reliable than a top-tier unit.",
