    "selftext": "I'm finding a Windows program that could track the data within a folder. Like GIT or GIT LFS, it could detect changes within a folder, track the changes like adding files, moving files, deleting files. Commit a \"version\" of the changed dataset.\n\nAnd the most important part, and it's not easy to do with GIT - **Able to apply the changes to other cold storage copies according to the commit.** You could do git push when you have a git server running. But I don't prefer setting up a git server, and I only have multiple copies of cold storage, none of them are \"primary\".\n\nIt'll be amazing to just handle a single copy of data, arrange it, update it, and when other cold storages are online, I could just press a button to pass the update to the other copy instead of manually arranging the folders in the other copy again. And it'll be very clear to see the other backup is X commits behind.\n\nI've been using syncing programs like FreeFileSync, it does pretty well on syncing the adding data, but there's no way it would work pretty after rearranging the files within the copies.",

Or if you want to create a time machine like copy, using hard links, I think you might use rsync as others suggested. Or code your own sync, it\u2019s not very complicated.",

You install it on each machine accessing the files, and they all connect to a synology NAS, and it does two way syncing with conflict resolutions. Works well enough.",
