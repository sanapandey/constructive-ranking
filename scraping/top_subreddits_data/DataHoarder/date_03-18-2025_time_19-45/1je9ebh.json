It's more of a draft then anything super polished, but it was a lot less harder then I thought to get working.\n\nI still really need to get all traffic forced though NA region IPs to get around the extreme low upload speed of 100kbps right now.\n\nMy next goal is to play around with the torrent system to see if I can get that working properly and seeding.",
