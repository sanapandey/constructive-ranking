You can communicate to them via IRC on the #down-the-tube channel on Hackint.

What is the data? When do they need it stored/backed up/mirrored by? Where did they get the data? Why can't they store it themselves? How did they get the data?\n\nTwo of the easiest places to store large amounts of public domain (i.e. non-copyrighted) data that has a clear value to the general public are 1) the Internet Archive and 2) AcademicTorrents.com. I would recommend the person who has the data get in touch with those two organizations by email.\n\nFor specifically U.S. federal government data from 2024 and/or 2025, the Data Rescue Project is an additional organization I would recommend contacting: [https://www.datarescueproject.org/about-data-rescue-project/](https://www.datarescueproject.org/about-data-rescue-project/)",

No clear idea when that is, but the writing's on the wall, so to speak.\n\n* Where: They have a publicly available API to access data, as long as you've authenticated.  Where to is the question to solve.\n\n*  Why: Nasa scientists are scrambling to make sure that their life's work, which represents decades of research into the climate and is a critical part of, among other things, weather forecasting, is at risk due to the current administration.\n\n* How: We have a few engineers coordinating the technical side of things, but \"how\" depends on where we can put the data.  A distributed solution may involve, for instance, IPFS.  If there are folks interested in helping out and that represents enough storage, great.  If the Internet Archive is able to help, we plan to distribute some way to upload to them in a coordinated pattern.   ArchiveTeam may get involved.  The situation's evolving.\n\nThe volume of data is large enough that most existing systems would struggle, this isn't just scraping web pages.  It's complicated by the fact that you need credentials, even if it's publicly accessible.",
