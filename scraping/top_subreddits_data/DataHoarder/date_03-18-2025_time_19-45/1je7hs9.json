            "body": "My backup method is quite deep. I had a mishap with one hard drive, which led to the loss of about 3TB of data. Not very important data, but it made me think that it could've been my most precious data: Photos. So, over the many years, I've come to a backup strategy that I am satisfied with, and I still change a few things from time to time. I'll describe it as it is now:\n\n**Stage 1: Camera**\n\nAll the camera that I have used since 2012, and the one I am currently using, they all have dual memory card slots. This is where my backup starts: as soon as I take a photo. I always use two memory cards, configured to save images on both cards at the same time. I have had a few memory cards fail on me, and this backup step have saved me a few times.\n\nI use multiple sets of cards: currently I have three sets of 512GB cards (so total 6 x 512GB cards). I do not delete photos from cards. Once a set is full, I took them out of the camera, keep them safe, then I use the second set. And then the third set. Once all sets are full, I go back to the first set and format them in camera. So basically, until I cycle back to the first sets, they are still acting as backup.\n\n**Stage 2: Main storage**\n\nI keep all my photo in my PC. I have an Enterprise grade hardware RAID controller, which has 8 x 16TB hard drives configured in RAID6. All the hard drives are Enterprise grade. This is my main storage. RAID6 ensures data integrity even if two hard drive fails, also it gives me the necessary speed that I need for fast read / write. The controller ensures the drives are healthy by doing patrol reads and also checks for data consistency, both these tasks can be scheduled.\n\n**Stage 3: External backup 1, 2 & 3**\n\nI backup three times a month. I have events created on my phone, so I never forget to do them. First of every month, I do a full backup on an external RAID enclosure (DAS). This is configured in RAID1 (Enterprise grade HDDs). Backup takes about 15 hours.\n\n10th of every month, I do another backup on a few single SSDs. All are Enterprise SSDs.\n\n20th of every month, I do another backup on a single hard drive, this serves as my offsite backup (Again, enterprise grade HDD)\n\n**Versioning: 3 month / 1 year**\n\nI keep a separate copy of backup for three months; this only gets overwritten once every three months. If I accidentally delete a file or something happens and I am missing files, this is my way back.\n\nSame goes for a 1-year backup. I actually am reaping the benefits of this as I found a few files that I deleted, but now I'd like to look at them again. I'm going through the year-old drive and finding a few files that now I want to keep.\n\n**Offsite backup: At my sister's place**\n\nThis is the third copy of my monthly backup. I keep it at my sister's place, which is about 8km away. This is just in case there is a disaster, and my place is compromised / everything-lost-situation.\n\n**Cloud: 8TB lifetime plan**\n\nI have an 8TB lifetime cloud plan, where I upload only the most important files. This is done in random, whenever I deem something as important enough to have a cloud backup.",

For that, I am fortunate to have my wife who has unintentionally given me multiple opportunities to ensure that everything works OK.\n\nIt started with the corruption and imminent failure of a laptop harddisk containing important thesis files for which no backup existed and that I had to recover. Then some time later, she wanted to make a backup copy of her data, but accidentally used 'rm' instead of 'cp'. Turns out that 'rm' is not an effective backup command.\n\nAnd more recently, after I had just setup a new storage machine with MergerFS and SnapRAID, she deleted more than intended of some \"Linux ISOs\". Low priority data that I don't do proper backups for, but it gave me a good opportunity to test the undelete function of SnapRAID.",
