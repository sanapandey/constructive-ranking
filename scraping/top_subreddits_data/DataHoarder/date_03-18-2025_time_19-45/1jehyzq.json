    "selftext": "I recently ordered a dual bay NVMe SSD enclosure that takes up to 8TB each for a total of 16TB, for longevity / future use.\n\nBut for now, I only need 4 TB, so I just purchased one 4TB \"drive\" (is this the right word?). I didn't do two x 2 TBs because I wanted the option to buy the second 4 TB \"drive\" when I needed it, instead of having to overhaul the whole thing.\n\nHowever, it just dawned on me that perhaps this might cause instability issues -\n\nIs it generally a bad practice to leave one bay empty in this type of enclosure, or is it safe to proceed with just one 4TB drive in the 2 bay device?\n\nThank you in advance for your generous time - Theresa",

                            "body": "Some fancier devices (like 2-bay NAS's) offer some extra features. Like if you install two drives they can make sure both hold exactly the same data (called \"mirroring\", or RAID1) so if a single drive dies everything seamlessly keeps working from the other one. Or, they can interleave data reading/writing to both drives to make them appear as a single larger+faster drive (called \"striping\", or RAID0).\n\nI believe you *can* buy some dual-NVMe enclosures that also do RAID0 or RAID1, but they're expensive and not common. Most of them just expose both SSDs as separate drives (like different drive letters in Windows).... and if you want any extra features you need to add them yourself in software.",
