For example watching recent Napoleon movie and learning about the French revolution. They don't use primary source materials they just fuck around with fan fiction and call it teaching material.

Hitler and his artifacts are relegated to museums and history books, where they remain uncensored, to learn about. The exact opposite of erasing history.\n\nThose confederate statues represent the fight to preserve slavery.
