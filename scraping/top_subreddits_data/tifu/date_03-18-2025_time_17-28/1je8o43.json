    "selftext": "\n\nI was getting ready for school and was running late, it happens. it was pouring rain and I tried running but I missed it. I forgot to replace my umbrella since the possibly of rain never crossed my mind. I was soaked, I didn\u2019t want to ask my grandma to drive me because someone needed to wait on the plumber. So i called an Uber, i can\u2019t drive but I\u2019m studying for my learners permit and I can\u2019t ride a bike to save my life without training wheels. \n\nI wanted to save some money because I want to buy an extension to keep my gaming laptop from overheating, I got the cheapest option which was an Uber XL for $13.07, I\u2019m not obese (anymore), but it was my best option.\n\nwithout realizing what I did, I ordered an uber 20 minutes away and the old guy was \u201chard of hearing\u201d and only communicated by text. I stand outside 5 minutes before my Ubers arrive so I had time. I see the MF show up at the wrong address but before I can respond he text me \u201cI arrived\u201d, then immediately cancelled the ride. For example I live at house 431 and he arrived at house 425, far enough to see but I would have to walk for a minute. \n\nThis was the first time an Uber cancelled a ride on me. I was about to be charged a fee but I didn\u2019t have enough funds after the first charge so my bank kept declining, I only keep about $15 in my checking at a time and the rest I put in my savings. \n\nI ended up being even more late because of this, my grandmother reluctantly drove me after hearing what happened. I had to text customer support to get a refund and for some reason they gave me $20 in 2-3 business days, I\u2019m never using Uber again though (except for UberEats).\n\nTL;DR, called an uber because I missed the bus in the rain but the uber showed up at the wrong address then canceled, fuck you lance I\u2019m cold.
