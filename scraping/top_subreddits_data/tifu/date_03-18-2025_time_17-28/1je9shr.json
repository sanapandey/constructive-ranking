    "selftext": "College student here. Haven\u2019t cooked anything for the past few days, and wanted to eat something else. I thought of tacos, and then I went out to buy ground beef for tacos, didn\u2019t seem anything off with the beef so I bought it. I get home, and open the bag, fuck, it smells kinda off, but I\u2019m like this probably won\u2019t be that bad when I cook and add the seasoning. I cooked it and it was good. After eating, the grease I strained from the beef did NOT smell good. It smelled like the grease you\u2019d clean from the grease trap, just not that bad (Probably 20%). Regardless, the smell lingered in my dorm room and I\u2019m currently looking for ways to get rid of the smell, the dishes too had the bad smell because I didn\u2019t wash it immediately. I opened the windows and lit a scented candle my parents gave to me 2 years ago and it seems to be working? Anyways fuck the supermarket where I got the beef, and fuck me for not checking it clearly. I got an iron gut so I think I\u2019m gonna be fine.\n\nTL;DR: cooked spoiled(?) beef, stunk up my whole dorm room. ",
