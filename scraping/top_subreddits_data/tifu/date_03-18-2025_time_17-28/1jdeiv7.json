    "selftext": "Obligatory, this was a mess up over the past 5 years that just came to light today. \n\nSo in May 2020 I bought a house and moved to a different town/county. However the zip codes were VERY similar (made up zip codes but basically 76499 and 76449). The \u201ctown\u201d I was moving out of was a city with a relatively high crime rate and the town I was moving to was much quieter and safer. \n\nWhen I moved, I updated my address with Progressive and have been regularly receiving mail from them at my house. My account is on autopay and I haven\u2019t made any claims or changes in the last 5 years, so I don\u2019t ever log in to my account or pay attention to the paper work. \n\nWell today I just happened to finally log into my account for the first time in years and I noticed my street address was right, but it had the old zip code. I figured I\u2019d just update it quick so that it was correct and didn\u2019t create any possible issues in the future. \n\nAs I was finishing updating the zip code, I was informed my bill would be dropping by $22 a month! For the last 5 years I\u2019ve been overpaying for car insurance because I confused my zip codes. $1200+ given to Progressive for absolutely no reason. Certainly not a life changing amount, but infuriating nonetheless. \n\nI guess I should just be happy I finally got the savings on my car insurance I\u2019ve been wanting lmao. \n\nTL;DR: 5 years ago I moved to a new town with a very similar zip code but a very different crime rate than my previous address. Updated my address with Progressive but used the wrong zip code. Finally updated it 5 years later and discovered I\u2019ve been overpaying for car insurance the whole time. \n\n",
