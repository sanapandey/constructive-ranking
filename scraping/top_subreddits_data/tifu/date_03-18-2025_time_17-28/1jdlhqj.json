    "selftext": "A few days ago my astronomer brother learned of the oppertunity to photograph the ISS with dragon attached, and wanted to know more details about the pass so i fired up gpredict, it's probably the best satalite tracker out there, used by radio hams all over the world, i use it mainly for tracking weather and amateur sats, such as the ISS when they announce an ARISS event, or when there will be a weather sat pass so i can grab the signal and pull the image from it.\n\nThe first red flag was that the pass he mentioned wasn't showing up in the ephemeris, there was plenty of passes, just not this one as this specific time, but i found a decent pass, and he asked where the ISS was now, just in the gulf of mexico.\n\nNext he asked me to cross check the offical ISS tracker to make sure it wasn't off, and that's where i discovered my mistake, the ISS was actually over austrailia.\n\nIt turns out gpredict uses something called TLEs to make accurate pass forecasts and to work out where the sat is, it's some numbers that describe the orbit of the sat, they need updating, but gpredict doesn't update them unless you use the software regularly, last time i used gpredict was over a month ago.\n\nI updated the TLEs and everything is nice and accurate, but the damage was done, my brother now thinks gpredict sucks, doesn't reccomend it to anyone, and uses stellarium instead.\n\nTL;DR: Wrecked an astronomers first impression of a world renowned satalite tracking software by not updating the satalite trajectory magic in over a month, leading to completely inaccurate passes and orbits",
