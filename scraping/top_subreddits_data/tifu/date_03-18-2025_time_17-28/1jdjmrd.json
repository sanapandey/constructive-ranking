    "selftext": "Last night I got off work early, had dinner and  was looking around trying to decide what to do with the several hours before I had to be in bed. \n\nI didn't want to watch TV, play games, read or stare mindlessly at my phone and I wasn't particularly interested going outside seeing as it was absolutely pouring. \n\nLacking anything better to do I started reorganizing my yarn. Well I come across some yarn I had forgotten about and it sparks a memory of a pattern I had been looking at, so I pull up the pattern to check if it was the correct size yarn and it was! \n\nNow I've figured out what I am doing for the evening. I put on a podcast in the background, get out my knitting needles and cast on. \n\nI get so into knitting that it isn't until the latest episode of my podcast end and it switches to a random one with a deeply annoying presenter that I shake myself out of my zone, front panel of the sweater half knit. \n\nI stretch and check the time only to realise that not only have I completely missed my bedtime but I only have 3 hours before I have to be up for work. \n\nAnd the worst part is I know myself well enough to know that if I get really involved in something that I will not notice time passing at all. I almost always set a timer if I have a specific time I need to do something but because I was sure I had so much time before needing to get ready for bed I didn't set my alarm to get myself to put the needles down and now I'm dragging ass in the middle of my work shift.\n\nTL;DR: I forgot hyperfocus was a thing and didn't set an alarm to make myself go to bed on time so I got less than 3 hours of sleep on a work night ",
