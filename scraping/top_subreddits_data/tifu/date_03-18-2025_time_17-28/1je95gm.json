    "selftext": "TIFU Hi Reddit, I messed up big time. I got an email during work from a fake Netflix email saying my payment failed. I thought it was because I changed my debit card recently. I didn\u2019t think before I acted and tried to quickly update my info before my boss came back into the room. The moment I sent everything through was the moment I realized I fucked up. I saw that it was an email from a \u201cnoreply\u201d. I gave them my debit details, name, address, phone #, SSN, mother\u2019s maiden name. You can call me stupid. That was one of my stupidest moments in life because I\u2019m usually skeptical about these sorts of things too. But in the heat of the moment I absolutely blanked out and gave them my info.How would you go about this fuck up. I already froze my debit card.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI fell for a email phishing scam and gave them all my info.",

Then you can go and update your payment information anywhere it's used.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for depending on the information they have is account recoveries. There is often a system to recover accounts if you lose access to your email, or lose access to you 2FA. This can often be done with enough personal information. Generally, you will receive an email about it. The problem with this is they will switch the account to a new email, with a new password and you will have to recover the account back.\n\nIf they do mange to get in to your email, make sure to check if they added things like forwarding rules to the account. They often like to do it just to fuck with you when you take the account back. Last email recovery I looked at, they blocked all emails from a specific company that the person did a lot of business with. It made the email account look normal but the person and the company were no longer seeing emails from eachother.",
