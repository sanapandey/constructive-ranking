    "selftext": "I haven't eaten in hours, so I decided 'I'll just have a few peeps.' Since it was in my room and easy to have. I get sick extremely easily, especially with food. I have a small stomach and puked over and over if I eat what should be a normal meal. So I never try to eat too much, especially before bed. I was going to eat dinner but it was late, so I decided against it. My stomach started rumbling and I looked around my room. I didn't really have anything on hand, and for mental health reasons I can't go into our kitchen alone at night. So I decided to eat some peeps. It was an 8 pack, I thought I would have a few, drink some water, and go to bed. Nope. I just kept eating and eating. I ate all 8 of them. I felt fine at first, but once it hit 11:50 I started to feel it in my stomach. Now it's almost midnight, I have school tomorrow, and I'm gonna be sick. I should NOT have eaten those peeps man. I had crackers in my room, why didn't I eat those?? Anyways... \nTL;DR: I fucked up tonight by eating 8 peeps on a school night, now I feel like I'm gonna be sick. It's not as bad as anyone else's fuckups but damn it it's still a major fuck up to me. I was not thinking AT ALL.",

It was a pain that one couldn't even imagine, I could literally track where in my digestive system this fucking mountain of baby carrots were travelling and I just wanted to just do anything to get those damn devil fingers out of my body. One of the worst nights I've ever had, haven't touched a little orange MFer since then and as far as I am concerned, they can all burn in hell.",
