    "selftext": "Just remembered this little incident while flicking through comments.\n\nI used to have a job where I went to businesses, schools, etc to empty the sanitary bins in ladies toilets, as well as other things like refill air fresheners, replace urinal mats etc. Not a glamorous job I know, but it's better than being on benefits and it kept a roof over my head.\n\nAnyway, one place I went to (everyone had set routes that were either weekly, fortnightly or monthly so we were  the regular service operative for said place we went to) was a little office and I pressed the buzzer to get let in. As I was waiting, I looked around and saw the word \"receptionist\" underneath the buzzer.\n\nUsually in situations like this, they answer and I just say \"I'm here to do the bins\". But today I had a complete brain fart and as soon as someone answered I blurted out \"I'm here to do the receptionist.....sorry, the bins! I'm here to do the bins!\"\n\nTo say it was awkward when I went to get the sheet to say that I'd been there and done what i had to signed by the receptionist would be an understatement. \n\nThankfully that office was one of my monthly routes so gave a bit of time for everyone to forget it ever happened but my coworkers didn't let me forget it for a while.\n\nTL:DR I unwittingly found myself in an adult film because of a brain fart\n\n",

My husband still has this cringe to remember.He was working in his dad's gas station, back in the day when they used to check your oil after a fill up. This lady with enormous breasts got her car filled and he was going to check her oil. He meant to ask her to release her hood lock or pop her hood but what came out was \"will you pop your tits?\"",
