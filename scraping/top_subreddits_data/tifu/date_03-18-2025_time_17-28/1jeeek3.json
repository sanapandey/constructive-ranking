I feel ashamed asking my parents for money, and I wanna make money myself.\n\n I literally have no money as it is, and I always grab at chances to get money. So when I saw this investing thing going on, I decided; why not put some money in? Well, the dude requested it to be on PayPal. And so, I ended up paying him \u00a340. Nearly ALL the money to my name. I fucked up. Big time, and I couldn't really do anything about it. Tried to appeal, say 'my account got hacked' or some shit. Didn't work. World's been against me for the past few weeks. ATP I wanna give up. If you've seen my previous post, you'll see my life is a fucking misery. Shit goes wrong in my life all of the time, I guess. \n\nTL;DR: Got scammed, lost nearly all of my money, now I have \u00a320 to my name.",

Also, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. There's no fast track to big money, you have to work for it. You can't just put money in a website and it triples in 2 days. It's all lies.

Learn a lesson for 40 rather than end up like some people who have lost over 40,000. \n\nBest advice I can give is that you should be more skeptical - if you stay smart by realizing nobody will give you money/help you profit online, and nobody will randomly fall in love with you online, you\u2019ll avoid a large majority of scams. Perhaps there are some 1% chances these things will happen, but it\u2019s not worth the 99% chance that you get scammed.  Especially since you already admit you\u2019re gullible. \n\nIf you want money, get a job. Given your age, real employment might be tough but even some odd jobs like yard work, etc would help. Find real jobs that are in person doing real work rather than anything online; unfortunately there are lots of remote employment or task scams. Please read up on those on r/scams",
