    "selftext": "So about last week I went to a Walgreens-Urgent Care combo since my partner needed to get a urine test for a UTI. While waiting around for the appointment to be finished, I ended up looking in the sexual wellness section because I needed lube and sometimes like to laugh at the strange male sex health products. \n\nSince all I hear about gas station boner pills is that they\u2019re snake oil and do not do anything, I had the bright idea of trying one out. I spotted one on the shelf that seemed the most interesting, the Extenze Original Formula Male Enhancement drink. Cherry flavor to top it off. The package was covered in a strange sticky substance (should\u2019ve taken it as a sign) but said screw it, grabbed it and checked out. \n\nThat drink sat in a cabinet for a week but we both agreed to try it out when the UTI passed and we were both in the mood. That day finally came and I grabbed that bottle, ripped the top off, and took a massive swig like I was in the desert and dying of dehydration. \n\nThe first 30 minutes, I felt nothing. After that, I entered hell. \n\nThat shit made me feel like the incredible hulk. That shit made be feel like the terminator. That shit made me feel like the predator. That shit made me feel like max payne. That shit is what Hunter S Thompson was on when he was writing The Rum Diary. I could feel my heart beating out of my chest and I do not know if it was even beating in time. I thought I needed to go get an EKG but took a muscle relaxer instead to kill the feeling. Probably one of the worst feelings I\u2019ve ever had and I do not recommend it. \n\nTL;DR:\n\nTook a gas station boner pill, felt like I was going to have a heart attack. Never doing that again. ",

This includes amphetamines, cocaine, etc but technically also stuff like coffee, although that's not really what people consider uppers.\n\nDowners are the opposite of that, slowing stuff down, like benzos, opiates etc.\n\nThe biggest risk in mixing uppers and downers is that you take too much of one, and when the other one stops working the balance you had is off and you overdose. This is how most people on speedballs die (heroin + cocaine).\n\nBut mixing uppers and downers is not generally bad, healthcare professionals stop an overdose of one by giving you the other (very broadly speaking)",

Yohimbe was the worst drug I've ever taken (aside from this one time when I actually ate the brown \"acid\")\n\nWasn't doing it for horniness. Back then I was more \"let's read extensively about this on Erowid, take a dose, lay still and see what happens\".\n\nCan't remember how much I took. It was just pure yohimbe. But a half hour later I grew irrationally agitated. Skin crawling discomfort. Hot and mad and mad. Heart racing. anxiety. Mad, hot, itchy, discomfort. Mad. \n\nYohimbe made me feel like a jerk to no one. I was lashing out at nothing but generally mad at not myself for this discomfort. It sucked. \n\nI've done almost every mainstream drug aside from PCP, and yohimbe was the worst with crack a close second.",

And unlike any other salvia experience I have ever had previous to that. I just never felt like I needed to go back after that one, felt like it might be acting greedy and I would be punished. It was one of the most positive experiences of my life LOL.

We also told them not to mix it with any other drugs, to drink lots of water (or something with electrolytes), and to monitor how their body is reacting (see a doctor if it gets weird).\nPart of working there was sex education- other stores aren't going to care about that and will just sell it to you. Even other Spencer's stores might sell you it no problem, but the two I worked at took shit pretty seriously.",
