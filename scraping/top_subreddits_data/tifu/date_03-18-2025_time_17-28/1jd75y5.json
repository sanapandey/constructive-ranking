    "selftext": "I'd like to explain because the situation isn't as bad as it sounds!\n\nI'm 20 and about to be 21 in three weeks. My boyfriend of 2 years is 21. He recently broke his leg and is in a full leg cast and using crutches. Which means he cannot carry anything while using his crutches. We are visiting some friends of ours who live in a different state, and every time we travel, my BF likes to buy a bottle of liquor from each place. He has a pretty big collection now, and it's pretty cool.\n\nSo, because we were traveling, he decided he wanted to pick up a bottle of Kentucky bourbon from Kentucky. So we headed to a liquor store near our hotel. The store had a sign on the door stating that nobody under 18 was allowed inside and nobody under 21 was allowed to buy anything.  We headed inside, and I waved to the guy at the counter. He greeted us, and my BF asked him if he could point us to the section that had \\*real\\* Kentucky bourbon in it. The guy was pretty nice and told us where to look. We headed to the section, and my BF took a while looking around and finally decided on a specific bottle, which happened to be on the lowest shelf. \n\nSince he one can't reach the shelf and two is on crutches and struggles to hold anything, I reached down and grabbed the bottle. We also grabbed 2 other bottles our friends asked us to pick up for them. We both headed for the register, and I set the bottles down. We chatted with the guy for a bit before he asked for my BF's ID. He showed it, and the guy began to ring us up. Before we got to pay, he turned to me and asked to see my ID. \n\nConfused, I asked why he needed it since I wasn't buying anything. The worker said I looked young, so I just shrugged and handed him my ID. He checked it over and even scanned it before handing it back and apologizing. The worker then informed us that he couldn't legally sell us anything. \n\nConfused, we asked why, and he said that since I wasn't 21 and clearly the one that was carrying the items, he couldn't sell them to us. Confused again, I asked him to clarify why he couldn't sell us the liquor. He explained really kindly why and then said that since we technically broke the rules, he'd have to ban us from the store permanently, and since we were really nice about the entire situation, he wouldn't call the cops.\n\nWe apologized and quickly left. In the end, we just headed to our friend's house, and he went with my BF to get the items. So, no biggie, but I did end up getting us banned from shopping at a random liquor store in  Kentucky.\n\nTL;DR: I didn't know it was illegal for anyone under 21 to carry bottles out/around a store for the person who is 21 and purchased them, which resulted in me and my BF getting banned from a liquor store in a state we don't live in. \n\n",

But that's illegal. Anyone participating in the alcohol sale in any capacity has to be of age.\n\nI look a fair deal younger than my husband, and have had to go back to the car for my own wallet to show ID for him to get a case of beer I didn't even know was in the cart. But because we are adults and we're an obvious couple, it's reasonable to assume that we both will be drinking it. I'll say I've seen it go too far- once a gas station cashier saw me in the car at the gas pump and asked for my ID when I wasn't even in the store. (Babyface)\n\nIf a cashier sells alcohol to someone they know or can reasonably assume will be giving said alcohol to a minor, that's contributing to the delinquency of a minor and they can get in major trouble.  Sure, an underage person is probably drinking at home and it's very unlikely to get caught. But if they got into a car accident, first question is going to be \"where did they get the booze?\". \n\nSo the degree to which a cashier will care whose ID they see really depends on their own judgement, but they can say no to anyone.",

In my case, with an invisible disability, I'm more likely to be harassed or even assaulted (it's happened) for \"faking\" a disability than I am to get someone willing to help me. I look young and healthy.\n\nIn my experience, clerks don't help people much at all anymore. They're not paid enough to care. They do the bare minimum, and they go home. Some are great, and I appreciate them, but others, not so much.\n\nClerks not helping people with disabilities would itself be a problem with the ADA, but...you kind of get used to a certain level of people being unhelpful, and just learn to deal with it. Given that lack of assistance, people come up with solutions, like having their family members carry the groceries.\n\nMy mother sometimes walked with a cane. Suppose (here I go with speculation again) that I pushed a shopping cart for her when I was underage, that had wine in it, along with all the other groceries. Does that mean my mother and I should have both been banned and ejected from the store? So then at that point, how does the ADA come into play? That's the sort of question I'm asking here.\n\nAsking questions is how we learn. When people get mad at someone for simply asking a question, there's a problem.",

The cashier started to ring up our stuff and when she got to the bottle of wine she asked to see all of our IDs. I asked why and she said that she couldn't sell alcohol to anyone that had a minor with them. I asked her if that would apply if he were 3 years old and in a stroller. I asked her to call over the manager and she said that was their policy, even though he was our son and we were well over the legal age and only bought one bottle of wine. She wouldn't even let me go out to the car and come in by myself to purchase one. I had to actually go to another store. \n\n  \nI get that they were trying to prevent one legal person from buying for everyone else, but come on, that was extreme.",
