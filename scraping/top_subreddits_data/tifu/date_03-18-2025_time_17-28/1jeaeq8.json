    "selftext": "I have a dental appointment tomorrow. My 3 year old son has a dental appointment the day after. His appointment is at a different place from mine, and they have different admin systems.\n\nToday, I got a text message telling me to complete a form about my medical history before my upcoming dental appointment. I clicked the link, filled in the form with my details and then clicked submit. I then got to a page saying something like \u2018thank you for filling in the medical history for (son\u2019s name).\u2019\nThis was when I realised my mistake. \n\nSo\u2026 I told my kid\u2019s dentist that he is currently pregnant, that he had his appendix removed as a teenager and that he has recently been prescribed medication for a yeast infection. \n\nTLDR: filled in my 3 year old kid\u2019s medical history form with my own information, including saying he is currently pregnant.
