    "selftext": "I recently started PT and was assigned several exercises to do to improve my core strength. This evening I was down on the floor doing all of them and I did all of the hard ones first, then I stood up took a quick break before doing the last couple that are more relaxing stretches. I deserve a treat though right for finishing the hard ones??? So I popped a slice of chocolate orange into my mouth and then got on all fours to do the yoga move \"cat/cow\" where you alternate between arching your back up like a scared cat and down like a relaxed cow. So I start doing this with the chocolate in my mouth as you do, And of course since it's yoga I automatically start doing the deep breathing that's associated with yoga in the nose out the mouth... On the second rep when I bring my head up and do a deep inhale through my nose I suck the chocolate into my nose causing an instant burning sensation. I try to ignore it and just finish the reps but it's getting worse and worse and then I start sneezing and chocolate is coming out my nose. Who knew that eating chocolate while doing yoga was so dangerous....\n\nTl:Dr ate chocolate while doing the cat cow pose and inhaled it into my sinus cavity",
