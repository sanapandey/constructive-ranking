    "selftext": "So I (16f) was in the car with my mom and my brother (13m) on the way home from a drs appointment. My brother jumped into the front seat and made a sarcastic comment. My mom called him an asshat. This is where the problem starts. \n\nMy mom said that she was sorry she called my brother an asshat, and he said he was used to it because I called him an asshole all the time. My mom got mad at me, and we had a very civil discussion on my actions and my brothers. Now here is where I fucked up. My mom said that when my brother does annoying things, I have to gently call him out. I responded with \u201cyeah, usually I just call him an asshole.\u201d So you may be thinking, not that bad, but then my mom started yelling because she thought I was calling him an asshole again. And long story short, I was a smartass. \n\nShe was saying things like \u201cyou have to be nicer to your brother\u201d and I responding with \u201cat least I\u2019m not the one yelling.\u201d She then started prattling off a list of things she was going to take away from me, including my PT appointment tomorrow. \n\nLong story short, I have chronic hip pain from hip dysplasia, that gets waaay worse if I don\u2019t see my PT. She does a lot of manual therapy that is great for my hip that can\u2019t be done at home. I really rely on my PT. \n\nBack to the story. I responded with \u201cwell, I will know who to blame when I need hip replacements at 30 from arthritis\u201d when then responded with \u201cor you will wish you were nicer to your brother\u201d and I responded \u201cor you will wish you didn\u2019t overreact over a single fucking comment.\u201d Now through all of this, my brother was still in the front seat. \n\nWhen we got home, my brother locked himself in the basement. After, my mom and I got into a yelling match. So uh yeah. I fucked up pretty bad during this match. \n\nWhen my mom wanted me to apologize, at first I refused saying things like \u201cit is my brothers fault too, he is a jerk to me\u201d and then when my mother (rightfully) continued to insist an apology I said \u201cI am sorry you mis interpreted what I said\u201d\n\nYeah. Not my finest moment.\n\nTL;DR, tifu by being a smartass to my mom when we got into an argument about the way I treated my brother\n",

She is actually a really amazing mom who would do anything for me. I think in that moment she was blinded by the fact that I was hurting her other kid, so she leveraged something that was really important to me. We talked it out like 10ish min ago, and I am going to PT. She is really trying her best to get me to get along with my brother, and I honestly think she is VERY far from a horrible person.",
