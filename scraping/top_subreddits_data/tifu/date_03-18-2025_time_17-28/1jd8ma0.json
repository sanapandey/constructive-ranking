    "selftext": "I was hosting a housewarming party at my place, and I invited a few of my friends. One of them had recently broken up with his girlfriend of a few years. He had just started dating another girl, and they came to my party together. She seemed like an interesting and fun person. She even brought me flowers and learned my full name, which is pretty difficult to pronounce. It seemed like she would be a really nice friend to have.   \nEverything was going well, we were all having fun, drinking cocktails, talking and so on. At one point in the evening (I was already pretty drunk), I wanted to ask her what she does for a living, and I accidentally used the wrong name. I called her by the name of my friend's ex, which is in no way similar to her name. I instantly sobered up enough to know I had messed up. It was soooo awkward. I immediately apologized and corrected myself, but the damage was already done. Being the nice person that she is, she did not make it a big deal and said it was okay, but when I looked at my friend, he was so uncomfortable. The other guests tried to laugh it off and make it less awkward. The party finished a couple of hours later, everyone went home and I never saw this girl after that. I think they are still together, but I made everyone feel uncomfortable so it makes sense they did not want to hang out after that. As a seasoned people-pleaser, I look back at this moment as my nightmare. It goes into the list of TIFU moments I think of when I can't fall asleep.  \n  \nTL;DR I was drunk and called my friend's new girlfriend by his ex-girlfriend's name, which made it really awkward, and my friend never invited me to hang out with them afterward.",

Invite them over, DONT DRINK, and explain that you didn\u2019t mean it and that you really liked her and deeply appreciated her learning your name and that you thought she would be a cool friend to have. Hand her a fork n ask her to stab you in the neck for some levity. Ask her if you can just start over cuz she seems cool. Surely she will understand it was an innocent drunken mistake & extend you some grace.",
