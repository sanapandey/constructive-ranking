    "selftext": "Obligatory, this happened back in June of last year.\n\nSo, yeah. Title pretty much sums it up.\n\nI live in Texas and it was a hot summer day, and like the absolute genius I am, I left two pancakes in my car. It must have been there from 10 am to about 6 pm as I was doing quite a bit of errands and shopping, long enough that it basically slow-cooked itself in the sweltering heat. Now, instead of throwing it away like a normal person, my dumb ass thought, Hey, this is fine, right? I ate one of the pancakes when I got home and put the other in the fridge.\n\nNext morning I felt a little off but hey it is what it is. I pulled the leftover pancake from the fridge, took a bite and realized it tasted a lil funny. I chalked it up to bad fridge taste. \n\nI went out with family to a buffet and felt kinda off, a little confused and not very hungry. I drank alot of sprite and ate some shrimp but felt like I got hit by a truck. \n\n\nA few hours later, right before bed, my body was like, We\u2019re gonna make you regret every decision you\u2019ve ever made. I got hit with the worst fever, chills, and pain imaginable. You know when you feel so bloated you know you need to throw up to feel better? I struggled to get comfortable in bed and it hit me, i need to throw up like right now. I made it to the bathroom just in time to throw up a pink sludge. Perfect. I thought i could just go back to bed at this point but n o p e. I must have thrown up at least eight times. My throat was absolutely raw at this point it was 2 in the morning. I had work in a few hours but I had this feeling where I just felt like I was dreaming and I was pretty confused. \n\nI let my family know, hey I think I need to go to urgent care. Turns out, I had severe sepsis. Ended up being moved to the hospital where they kept me for a week hooked up to IV antibiotics, feeling like death itself.\n\nWhile they were running a bunch of tests and scans, the doctors were like, Hey, you\u2019ve got cysts on both ovaries. Might wanna check that out.  \n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\n\nDuring the scans, they also found a weird lytic bone lesion on my hip and femur. More tests, more scans, and surprise!\u2014I had multiple myeloma. \n\nAnd those ovarian cysts? Long story short, surgery happened this past week, and I lost both my ovaries. Turns out, those cysts weren\u2019t just cysts. They were teratomas\u2014aka creepy tumor babies that had h a i r. Sizes of lemons. Both of them.\n\n\nSo, to recap: my incredibly dumb decision to eat a sun-baked pancake somehow led to finding out I had two ovarian monsters and cancer.\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t gotten sepsis and ended up in the hospital, I wouldn\u2019t have known until way later, and things could have been much worse. So, in the most messed-up way possible, that stupid pancake might have actually saved my life.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Ate a pancake that slow-cooked in my car, got severe sepsis, lost both ovaries to teratomas, and accidentally discovered I had bone marrow cancer. \n\n\n\n\nEdit: Some clarification because I didn't word this correctly lol\n\n\n-The pancakes were from a restaurant I went to that morning. I asked for a to-go plastic box and I placed that box in the back seat and just left it there while I ran errands.\n\n- I suspect it was the pancakes and not the shrimp because by the time I was feeling super sick it had to have been 25 hours since having the pancake and maybe an hour after the shrimp. Plus my brother gave the extra pancake to our dog who subsequently had violent Hershey squirts and had to be taken to the vet because she wouldn't eat. She got better after antibiotics.\n\n- I think the pancakes hit hard because of the underlying undiagnosed cancer that lowered my immune system plus I would take Zofran, an anti-nausea medicine that would keep me from throwing up, and alot of pepto bismol. So my body couldn't get rid of the pancake until the next night after the Zofran had already worn off.\n\n- I'm a little smooth brained, I know you're not suppose to eat food after it's been sitting out but I had a moment of weakness! The pancake was so good at the restaurant!\n\n\n",

They kept saying that it was from her smoking weed and cigarettes or it was just indigestion/ulcers whatever. Finally it got so bad that she couldn't eat so they finally did an endoscopy and she had stomach cancer. It was too late to do anything and she died like 6 months later. It was over ten years ago and it still makes me mad when I think about it.",

I've lost 47lbs in about 4 months through no effort or change in my diet or fitness. My stomach hurts all the time sometimes going to my back in the shoulder blade area. I'm nauseous multiple times a day. I've had an abnormal ana but the rheumatologist isn't really doing anything (too focused on looking for lupus and if it's not lupus he doesn't seem like much help). I told him about my gi issues and he said he wasn't a gastro to bring it up to them but there's so many immune diseases that also mess with your stomach. Idk. There's so much more symptoms and abnormal blood tests and results but it still doesn't feel like they care or want to know what's wrong. :/",

A persistent cough that was only sometimes productive, and shoulder pain. In ten years, they did one x-ray of his shoulder and told him everything looked ok and he probably just pulled something and to take it easy. They treated his cough as allergies, bronchitis, asthma, and kept giving him various medications. He'd complained about general body pain here and there, but he's a pretty stoic guy, so they told him to take some ibuprofen and to take it easier on his old body.\n\nThen one day he sat down in his chair and the shoulder pain was so bad he physically could not move to get up. My grandma called the life squad. It was the day after Christmas. He had end-stage bone and lung cancer (lung cancer was likely the original primary cancer) and they told us six weeks would be an optimistic estimate. He immediately signed a DNR and they moved him to hospice a few days later. He died on Valentine's day, seven weeks later. \n\nWatching someone you love die of bone cancer is indescribably hard, and I'm sorry you had to do that too. I'm sorry the doctors failed your mom. It shouldn't be that way.",

In late November the pain was bad enough she went to the ER, where they discovered her pancreas and abdominal wall were full of tumors. She rallied to enjoy Christmas with my daughters, then passed away a couple weeks later.\n\n\nAbout 6 years ago I had a persistent cough. I went to get looked at and was told it was pre asthma. A year or so later my heart rate started gradually dropping. I went to a cardiologist, and with no great sense of urgency they scheduled a couple tests a month or so out. By the time I showed up for the tests, I had developed \"total heart block\". They wanted to roll me down to the emergency department on a stretcher, as if I hadn't just walked into the building. At least I got to feel like I was in a Dr. house episode; turns out it was sarcoidosis.\n\n\nDoctors have no idea most of the time, but are generally incapable of being straight forward or humble about it.",

You\u2019re right about the out of pocket expense being nothing compared to the expense of a cancer diagnosis. The out of pocket cost of a PET/CT is THOUSANDS, rather than hundreds, so that wasn\u2019t an option for me. You\u2019re also right about the costs associated with treatment. \n\nEven with \u201cgood\u201d insurance, the deductibles for the imaging I *did* get and for all the surgeries, plus procedure copays, and repeated specialist-level copays, the hospital stay copays\u2026that all financially crippled us. For one of my diagnoses, I didn\u2019t even have infusions, \u201cjust\u201d monthly shots in the infusion room for years, medication copays, plus additional surgeries still to this day\u2026especially with certain diagnoses, it\u2019s not just a one and done process like people think. Much of this can also go on almost indefinitely, even without metastasis, and that\u2019s just the *monetary* expense. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your dad and I\u2019m hoping he had a decent survival time. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nIronically, when my mom had a CT for pneumonia (with preexisting COPD), lung cancer *was* found. It could have been a met from breast cancer or a new primary, but we never got the chance to find out. She didn\u2019t survive, but she didn\u2019t die OF cancer in her lung, she died WITH cancer in her lung. So we never even got to the biopsy or treatment phase for it (medical negligence \ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd2c) but it appears to have complicated things based on her blood work. That was exactly a year ago now that everything was happening and she passed on March 22 of last year. Now I\u2019m thinking how things might have turned out differently for her if she\u2019d had earlier detection and monitoring like you do? She smoked for more like 50 years! \ud83e\udee3\n\nYour GP is an absolute unicorn! I\u2019d seriously travel to see her if you could talk her into taking one more patient. My GP is very good, as well, and also spends a lot of time with her patients. She does schedule too many, though, so spending that time with her patients means waiting room times are often over an hour and up to two hours. She just can\u2019t bring herself to, and just won\u2019t say no to her patients needing to come in. I *do* think she might have finally stopped taking new patients. \n\nI do get routine CTs of chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast to monitor my other diagnosis, so I technically am still getting monitored. CTs won\u2019t pick up everything in my case, though. Now that I think of it, already having those done was probably why I didn\u2019t qualify for that program. A \u201cnodule\u201d *was* actually found in my lung, but it hasn\u2019t increased in size, so it\u2019s less suspicious and no biopsy so far. \n\nI\u2019m so glad that you\u2019ve had clean scans and I hope you continue to. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffcYour doctor is proactive and if something in your lungs *is* ever found early enough, it *could* \u201conly\u201d require surgery and monitoring. I think it\u2019s fantastic that she\u2019s doing this for you!",

I\u2019m so sorry. \n\nMy mom actually worked with fabric dyes\u2026I think that\u2019s what it was\u2026when she was in fashion school or when she was a working in the department stores before she was a buyer, she was somehow regularly exposed back in the day? I don\u2019t remember exactly at the moment. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, though, that seemed to be important to her breast oncologist. So it\u2019s a similar situation about chemical exposure. \n\nShe never got the chance to get to the point of seeing an oncologist for her lung. She kept getting different strains/types of pneumonia from the rehab facility she had been in for her back. She had a contracted quite a few nosocomial infections from there. I do still have time to have her records reviewed. \n\nHer ultimate cause of death was a hypoxic brain injury from coding\u2026because of incompetence by the hospital. She coded because of a MUCUS PLUG!!!  They had moved her to a stepdown unit that was run by know it all APNs and PAs who decided not to bronch her as the ICU DOCTOR had planned for the day before she coded. \n\nHer EEG showed that multiple lobes were just gone. She had a *very* small chance of having ANY meaningful recovery. Add the lung mass finding, and there would never be any *meaningful* recovery. Her life would have been absolute torture with no quality of life. \n\nThe REAL bitch of it is that we took her off the vent on 2/28 last year and she lived 23 DAYS in hospice. She may not have been *fully* aware, but I was. The point is that she obviously didn\u2019t even need the vent. Even without having the bronch, simply paying attention to her, she really only needed suction to get rid of the mucus plug. \ud83e\udd2cStill considering having her hospital chart reviewed, too. \n\nThe only reason I didn\u2019t have an attorney look at either facility\u2019s charts right away was because she was 78 with multiple medical problems, so even if we *won*, a malpractice/wrongful death, in her condition it would have cost more time and money than we\u2019d *ever* recover. I had to pay funeral expenses and grieve, so I couldn\u2019t afford or emotionally have dealt with all of that initially. I\u2019m just now able to use the words \u201cmy mom died\u201d until now. I was still using euphemisms. \n\nAnyway, now that it\u2019s been almost a year since she died, I\u2019m able to think a little more clearly about the whole situation. I\u2019m also realizing that I could maybe affect preventing that level of negligence from hurting/killing other people. I just don\u2019t know if we\u2019d actually have a case without resorting to using one of those dirty, frivolous malpractice attorneys. I do know a good, ethical one who would at least review her charts, though, and would be honest about the situation. He mostly does malpractice, but he\u2019d also helped me to get guardianship for my dad. That\u2019s how I even know him.\n\nSorry for the long rant. This particular time of year, exactly a year since this all happened, has been difficult. I guess I should thank you for letting me vent. \ud83d\udc94",

I was actually in the medical field for a long time, as an MA to get clinical experience for my med school application. Life happened and I wasn\u2019t able to go. \n\nAnyway, I *was* commented with emotions, but the rehab facility did also have infractions like violating the patient to nurse ratio, not cohorting COVID or other contagious patients, hence the nosocomial strains of pneumonia my mom got. \n\nThe night my mom was transferred to the hospital, there was a huge delay. They tried to convince me that my mother wasn\u2019t altered, \u201cjust tired\u201d and called a transport company vs an ambulance. I called my brother to see if I was overreacting and they managed to gaslight both of us even though I knew better. She had been taken to the hospital by ambulance previously by the facility for lesser reasons. It was a frantic time and we had multiple aides messing with our heads. Once they got an actual nurse to come to the floor, they moved quicker, but the transport company was going to be there \u201cany minute.\u201d She was intubated less than 2 hours after she got to the ER. There was more, too. \n\nAlso, at this particular hospital, the APNs and PAs exclusively cover the floors, particularly at night and on weekends. This was a weekend. They all have an inferiority complex, which manifests itself as being condescending and refusing to call hospitalists when there\u2019s a problem. They\u2019re were allowed to completely cx the criticalist\u2019s care plan because she was, without even notifying me, she was move to a different floor. \n\nThere was also the problem of the RNs repeatedly ignoring the tele board. She was down for a total of 9 minutes, several of which were spent ignoring my mom\u2019s sats going down and waiting for the code team. Another nurse admitted this to us and we got her name. The nurses did low quality CPR, as well. They tried to cover it up by \u201cwarning me that she may have broken ribs.\u201d She was osteoporotic and there were NO broken ribs or sternum. \n\nThe threshold for med mal is standard of care AND that the outcome would have been the same. The outcome was not the same. This is why I would have had the chart review done before seeking out certifications of merit. Unfortunately, the hospital would have been a weaker case, particularly because of the strength of their legal team. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen extremely weak, frivolous cases where a jury, with no medical training, just has to feel bad enough for the plaintiff. \n\nI probably won\u2019t do anything about the hospital because a family member is a surgeon on staff there and would be retaliated against. That\u2019s how they are and I\u2019ve watched this happen first hand. \n\nPS. The care my dad had gotten at an LTAC was true ICU quality. It was, in some ways better than the ICU. For example, the entire staff seemed way more invested. Just one example is the doctor there actually went with my dad to the ER and waited for me to get there before he\u2019d leave. I was wary of having my father transferred to one, despite my NOT giving consent\u2026I still can\u2019t believe that. Thankfully, they gave him great care.",

It's distressing how often pain is also ignored because that's your body telling you something is wrong. We may be more likely to have aches and pains as we get older, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to figure out what's going on and resolve it. \n\nI'm sorry about your mom. She deserved a provider who would have taken her pain seriously and would have caught the cancer at a treatable stage. There's no excuse for letting people suffer, especially with the level of pain that bone cancer brings.",

I was told to exercise more, lose more weight because I was too heavy for my age and gender (I was on the cusp of being underweight for my BMI, I'm tall) and that it was just anxiety. I was pissed. I told him, \"exercise more? I cycle everywhere, do multiple intense martial art classes a week, I go bouldering on the weekends, I try and run a few nights a week, I walk a ton with my friends playing Pok\u00e9mon and you're telling me this is anxiety and me being unhealthy?! I've never had an anxiety attack doing martial arts in my life. I love it.\" \n\nI see the asthma nurse, I should be blowing 580 into the peak flow meter, I'm getting 320 at best, going down into the high 200s when I was having issues. I got put on meds and it was insane. I went from the most unhealthy person in my classes, always struggling to finish a warm up, to easily finishing the warm up before everyone else. It was absolutely crazy. I'm still shocked it was so different. Everyone was stunned and I was like yeah, I got asthma meds. Oh and my peak flow meter blows are now in the 400s. Still not where it should be but better. I should have been diagnosed as a kid but it was ignored.",

So I never said anything to my mom (single mom, not a lot of money, didn't want to bother her with it).\n\nMeanwhile apparently my coach did notice and just assumed I was anorexic. He kept calling my mom and telling her I was anorexic. He never mentioned the vomiting or blacking out. I found out about all of this later. I was skinny but a healthy eater.\n\nIt blows my mind as an adult that nobody called EMS or my mom when I was passed out in the field.

None of my symptoms were those of women with pelvic floor problems. \n\nFinally, months later, after begging and crying at them, a scan was sceduled. Again with a long wait as it wasn't urgent.

You need to understand. This isn't a funny \"haha, silly ignorant man\" moment. This is a \"my husband almost facilitated my death\" moment.\n\nWomen die when they date men who tell them they're overreacting and discourage them from going to the doctor.\n\nWhen a woman makes a post like that, \"something is wrong with my but my husband rolled his eyes at me and made me feel stupid so I haven't gone to the doctor yet\" my first advice (besides go to the hospital...) is divorce.\n\nWOMEN HAVE DIED. Because of your attitude. Because men don't believe women. It's rooted in sexism, dude. Women are *statistically* believed less often than men. Your ex was probably never a hypochondriac, but may have acted like one or felt like she had to ham up how bad she felt at times, due to how often she was disbelieved in her life. It's a positive feedback loop... you disbelieve a woman, so she gets more \"\"dramatic\"\" in an attempt to get men to listen to her, which only reinforces the man's bias that she wasn't worth listening to.\n\nI specify man because I'm talking about hetero relationships, but women also believe other women at lower rates than men. Shit. is. fucked.\n\nSeriously. The worst thing a woman can do is date a man who makes her feel like she is overreacting when she feels sick and unwell. That's how women end up on their deathbed with advanced cancer, or why they drop dead of heart attacks instead of going to the ER. It's extremely easy for a husband to play on a wife's insecurities and make her feel small and silly, and thus put her down enough that she gives up and doesn't go to the doctor.\n\nEspecially since, as you know, doctors have an awful habit of dismissing women and not treating us and just making us go away. Women *need* partners that will encourage them to keep trying to go to the doctors when we have bad experiences. Dating someone discouraging can literally kill us :( ... and HAS killed us. She would have died, at least in part because of you telling her her symptoms were nothing (apparently) if she didn't get lucky.",

                                    "body": "That's the stereotype that keeps doctors believing men over women, yes...\n\nYou need to understand though, so many things that people think is a \"man\" thing is actually a woman thing, or at least a both thing.\n\nWomen are terrified of going to the doctor. Women always get told they're overreacting, they're dramatic, etc.\n\nI had so many bad experiences with doctors that when I was actively dying from pneumonia, I kept saying \"one more day.\" Actually made my bf cry because he was so upset at me for not going, bless him.\n\nAND THEN WHEN I FINALLY WENT, I GOT TOLD I WAS OVERREACTING LMAO. Until the x-ray came back. The doctor was very quiet after that.\n\nI say this not to discount your experience (I know men often have trouble taking care of themselves) but to say: this actually DOES happen to women, just as much. Fear of going to the doctor, I mean.\n\nBecause we should all be encouraging each other to take their health seriously, women included. Only acting like men have doctor-aversion leads to everyone only discussing it about men even though women are less likely to be taken seriously, and are likely MORE afraid to go to the doctor than men... women need to be encouraged too.\n\nWomen have worse survival rates for a lot of problems because of hesitating to go to the hospital, getting treated poorly and disbelieved at hospitals, and in general because of male-centered medical procedures that primarily only researched male bodies.\n\nWomen die because they're so afraid to go to the doctor... often pressured out of going by their husbands. Whereas typically men will be pressured INTO going to the doctor by their wives/gfs.\n\nSo it feels like men already get tons of encouragement to go to the doctor. But women are still left behind, told we are overreacting, often by our partners. Then we get diagnosed with end-stage cancer and fucking die.\n\nAll this to say, yes, encourage men. But men have massively dropped the ball on women. Further up there is a husband talking about how he almost killed his wife because he didn't believe her and made her feel small about going to the doctor... like for fucks sake. Of all the people I know in my life, who are absolutely fucking terrified and hesitant and try to avoid going to the doctor as much as possible -- they're all women... \n\nSorry, I'm just tired of things that primary effect women being attributed as \"men's problems.\" Yes it happens to men but I guarantee you women hate going to the doctor more. Just logically, think about it. Women are constantly told we are overreacting/dramatic from since we were toddlers. We tend to have lower self-esteem and feel less entitled to things in life than men. Of course we are going to be the ones feeling like we are less deserving of going to the doctors... and hesitate more. Women wait until they're near death to go to the hospital *all the time.* I think someone has to be really, completely blind to how women are living their lives to say it's *men's* issue to be afraid to go to the doctor. OBVIOUSLY, the party that gets told they're overreacting, is going to go to the doctor less.",

You heard a woman say something and you said \"nah, she must be wrong. let me tell her she's wrong.\"\n\nIf one of your male friends came up to you and said \"doctors believe women less\" would you immediately say no to his face? or would you be more inclined to believe him.\n\nWomen are just believed less in every facet of our lives. Statistically. *It is a statistical fact.* \n\nOf course some doctors also dismiss men. There are a LOT of shitty doctors out there... but it just doesn't happen AS often. That's what statistics mean...\n\nAnyway, women also die more often from a lot of conditions than men because of this statistic. It's really shitty to handwave away women dying at higher rates in hospitals from the same conditions as men, because we are taken less seriously. Do you not see how dismissing women's literal deaths as not statistically significant might, you know? Dehumanize women?",

Also, among other things, women are:\n\n* More likely to be diagnosed with a psychological cause for pain\n* Likely to receive less pain medication\n* More likely to be prescribed anti-depressants\n* More likely to be referred for mental health services\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean doctors \u201cbelieve women less\u201d in general.  If that\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re taking away from these studies that show different outcomes, you\u2019re cherry-picking what you want to hear.  Consider the differences for antidepressant prescriptions and referrals for mental health services:\n\n* Why are men less likely to be prescribed antidepressants?  Are women over-prescribed, or are men\u2019s mental health issues being dismissed?\n* Why are men less likely to receive referrals for mental health services?  Are doctors dismissing their mental health issues?\n\nAnd then if you take a step back, is the root cause of the difference in pain medication that men are being over-prescribed pain medication?  I mean, we everyone knows of high-profile cases of famous men chronically addicted to prescription pain medication (e.g. Prince and Michael Jackson).  Is the solution to cut back on giving men pain medication until it evens out with the level women receive?\n\nBut in general, I think there\u2019s a major issue with doctors not wanting to do actual diagnosis.  They just want to fit your description of the symptoms in a convenient box and send you on your way.\n\n> Anyway, women also die more often from a lot of conditions than men because of this statistic.\n\nPlease give specifics and citations for this \u2013 it\u2019s easy to say stuff \u201ca lot of conditions\u201d, but then going from that to saying it\u2019s because doctor\u2019s are less likely to believe women is a big jump.\n\nWomen are more likely to die from heart disease than men, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be linked to doctors not believing women.  SCAD is rare, but the risk is highest around late pregnancy and childbirth \u2013 men simply don\u2019t have this risk factor.  Women are far more likely to receive radiotherapy for breast cancer than men, and the radiation exposure to the chest increases the risk of heart disease.  Menopause also increases the risk of heart disease, another risk factor that doesn\u2019t apply to men.  Women have smaller blood vessels than men on average, which makes blockages more likely.\n\nWomen are more likely to have strokes than men (and hence more likely to die as a result of complications), and once again, a lot of it is caused by risk factors specific to women.  Pregnancy increases the risk of stroke.  Hormonal birth control increases the risk of stroke.  Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of stroke.\n\nWomen are more likely to die from lupus than men because 90% of lupus cases are in women.  We don\u2019t know why.  It\u2018s been suggested that having two X chromosomes may be a contributing factor (e.g. see [this study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.aap8855)).\n\nYou push the line that \u201cdoctors don\u2019t believe women\u201d and that causes women to be more likely to die than men from the same conditions as as if it\u2019s just something that everyone knows, and anyone saying otherwise is obviously wrong.  But that isn\u2019t the picture I see from the actual research I\u2019ve read.",

Your insurance gets to be the ultimate arbiter in what tests you can have and what specialists you can see. Your doctor might be concerned, might want you to have some tests or see a specialist, but your insurance can just say \"lol, nope\" and off you go with your undiagnosed condition until it gets bad enough that it ticks the right box for the insurance company.",

Please do NOT use Social Media to research medical conditions -- you will get the snake oil sales people in droves, chiropractors and naturopathic \"doctors\" who are NOT medical doctors, and you may find the odd medical doctor who subscribes to treatments that are NOT evidence based (this is BAD). I am not a medical professional, so often if I really feel strongly that I have something going on more than stress, bad sleep, and weight issues, then I will ask if it is not those things, then what do you think I might have? Then I would ask to get tested appropriately. I recently had to do this when a chronic condition of mine flared and I was afraid that I had something like cancer going on. Turned out to be nothing this time thank goodness. I am still happy I spent the money on testing. I'm so glad they found your bad medical conditions and  you received treatment :)",

Asked for bloodwork, asked for physicals or exams to check for something wrong. Kept getting told he wouldn't do the tests because they're unnecessary, and i just needed to go outside, exercise, eat better etc\n\nI eventually said fuck it and went to a different doctor and paid out of pocket for them to requisition bloodwork\n\nThey found issues with 3 different hormones and liver problems. \n\nI went back to my original doctor and showed him the results, and he proceeded to spend the entire appointment lecturing me about ignoring him. About how he'd drop me as a patient if I wasn't going to listen. He looked up the other doctor and started shittalking them to me lol \n\nI said something like \"..well if I hadn't done this i still wouldn't know anythings wrong with me\" and he responded that there's nothing wrong, the test was performed incorrectly, and he's requesting me to go get bloodwork done again lol\n\nLike why couldn't you just test me when I asked over a year ago instead of having this weird enormous ego problem. Fucking doctors dude",

Obviously I'm not saying it couldn't happen because it happened to you!! \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut maybe it happened because your immune system was already in overload fighting the MM and teratomas (I've seen a lot of those and lemon-sized is impressive!) and your body had simply had enough-- 'lady we're already doing the best we can, so we're gonna make a big deal over an iffy pancake' \ud83d\ude09\n\nMaybe give yourself some grace over the 'irresponsible' part, bc you said that about the pancake in the initial story and I went 'yup, uh huh, okay fine, I would've eaten it too' \ud83e\udd23\n\nGlad you're on your way to recovery and told us the tale \u263a\ufe0f",

They got her changed into the gown at the hospital and as part of the exam the doc did a pelvic. The way she told it, doc had barely lifted the sheet and glanced down there before YELLING at the nearest nurse - \u201cWe need an OR immediately!!\u201d She said they barely had time to explain to her what was happening, and she was really out of it. Anyways; it turned out to be a football sized teratoma, and doc had seen the \u201chair\u201d basically crowning. This girl was very petite, too, no idea how something as big as a football could be growing inside her and not be visible. It was crazy. One of the student docs on her case studied her for like a term paper or something. Her surgeon was almost gleeful, and telling her what a cool and rare thing this was to see.",

Then again, I have never once wanted to be a doctor or nurse, and once passed out at the sight of leg bone showing under a severe laceration. Luckily someone else ran for the med kit, since I was, um, useless just then. Later when everything was sewn up nice and I was conscious again we agreed I was lucky my head landed on a teak deck and bounced, I am told, instead of cracking on concrete or something. I definitely would have been passed out if I were that doctor, and they would have had to run the gurney over me on the way to surgery. Jesus, what a story. Ok off to look up teratoma and freak out. Gosh y'all are so casual about it all. Whew! You got some serious something, my hair, what's left, is still standing on end. Speaking of scant hair, anyone nearing menopause shouldost def look into hormone replacement, see if it's something that might work for you, now that the studies that didn't actually tell us it was oncogenic have been correctly interpreted and all the collected data from everyone on Medicare has been correctly cleaned and interpreted. Too late for me thanks a bunch but not others; don't get ripped off by clueless doctors who haven't read a medical journal since graduating and don't read studies. It's a go, and even though it's waaaay harder to arrange than T for dudes, it's there for ya. Read up, advocate for urself if necessary. It can really make a difference to your health. Cheers!",

We had a big hiking/camping trip planned in NH and everyone had to \u201ctrain\u201d for it (we went on some local walks & hikes). Basically my mom wanted to make sure all the girls were prepared for a more difficult physical challenge - summiting a mountain. The day we were leaving for this trip, one of the girls in the troop who wasn\u2019t supposed to come decided to join at the last minute. She was not in shape or athletic at all and that was a concern for my mom and the other troop leaders. Well as it turns out, when we were hiking down from the summit of the mountain, this girl took a serious fall and ended up breaking her leg. Another girl and I had to hike down in the dark to get help while the adults stayed with the injured girl and the rest of the group. She went to the hospital where they ran some other tests and discovered that she had cancer. I don\u2019t remember what kind. It was a bizarre situation but I remember hearing my mom talk about how they might not have caught the cancer so early if not for that fated fall. She was treated and came back to school eventually and was fine.",

They told me it's probs nothing but had me go do an ultrasound. 2 hours later I was diagnosed with cancer. Post surgery doctor goes over results, 90% Embryonal Carcinoma, 10% mix of two teratomas.

With the possible exception of death camp \"\"plans\" where 'exercise' means hard labor and 'diet' means a bowl of questionable water with a strip of rotten potato skin. To be clear I am not minimizing horrendous conditions inflicted upon innocent people past or present I am saying a loss of 13 lbs in a single week is not possible, or even desirable, from a sane plan and is on the high end of GLP -1 triple active agents being administered as well. For that to be followed by further losses off plan is frightening, not delightful. It's an s.o.s. from a body in extremis. I say this in case anyone else reading this thread is experiencing a similar thing; don't let the pressure to be \"thin and sexy\" blind you to your body trying like hell to alert you that the shit has already hit the fan and you are sinking fast. As for American doctors, I have never, not once, had a good experience. The opposite was true when I lived in Europe. I had terrific care in both Spain and Germany and guess what it cost me? NOTHING. I tried to explain this to people when I returned but nobody believed me. Then again, I am not a dude, so,....oh, lastly, thanks for pointing out in the post about how women are treated with unwarranted skepticism by, well, almost everyone, that women do it to each other too. The woman I was with when my endometriosis started at 23 was dismissive at best and I was so used to being treated like that it didn't occur to me how fucked up that was until 20 years later, years that became a cycle of intense pain like 24 hours of labor pains and vomiting, followed by a brief window of relief then two weeks of dread as the day approached. And it was a woman who asked me if I had tried Midol when I had to call in sick. It still takes 7 to 10 years to even get a correct diagnosis for endometriosis, and an AVERAGE of 5 different doctors. And though it did not ultimately kill me, as in the horror stories here that make me incredibly sad to read, it did severely limit my human potential, and the pain, let me tell you, is indescribable, unless you have had a difficult time in labor, I kid you not. The fucked up thing is I still think nobody will believe me. That shit sticks in your head. All I want is for the strong young women coming up to be free of that internalized negativity and the crippling self doubt it creates. \nBy the way? The current Math genius of China is a chick, and an American girl at--I forget, Penn State or U of, just solved a problem concerned with wind turbines that nobody could solve for-get this - 100 years! YES! Women are so friggin smart, and so resilient, but we definitely need to help each other I'm looking at you, Supreme Court\nPeace Y'all",
