    "selftext": "So I (27F) went to a rave for the first time with my friends last night. This is not my typical environment and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Now, here is important information to remember, I have a genetic disease where I cant see well or at all  in low light environments. \n\nSo we get to the party, it's loud, it's crowded and I was ready to sit and enjoy a drink. After walking around for a bit, we finally see some chairs behind a sea of people. My friends squeeze in and I mindlessly followed them in my typical NPC state, taking the less crowded path on the other side. As i squeeze past the table, I go to take a seat on the empty spot that I thought I saw, except...y'know the spot was a living and breathing human! As my behind hovers above this poor unsuspecting victim my friend calls out to me and I realize my transgressions.\n\nImmediately,  I went into my regular reaction to embarrassment- paralysis! My friend stepped in and diligently apologized for me. After the fact, my friend was laughing and I laughed too but in the back of my mind I was wishing for certain death. I've now gained another thought to keep me up at night!\n\nTL;DR I couldn't see and almost sat on a stranger's lap.",
