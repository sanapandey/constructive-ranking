    "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been trying to land this job in consulting for oil companies for 9 months or more all my peers who work in consulting recommended me for this job. I\u2019ve been applying for months. I took the job I have now as a stepping stone to get into consulting. \n\nA buddy of mine finally called a regional manager who sorta knows me and my buddy vouched for me saying they should reach out and hire me. That got the ball rolling as the head of talent attraction began emailing me about two weeks later. \n\nAfter a few emails I got a phone call from the head of talent attraction the interview went phenomenal. She sent me a test over email and said not to worry about it, it was no big deal. just take my time and finish it. Well it turns out the test had zero to do with the oilfield or our area of consulting. It\u2019s just one of those dumb generalized aptitude test. I know I aced the personality, logic, situation portions of the test. I feel like I absolutely BOMBED the memory portion of the test I wasn\u2019t prepared for it at all! \n\nThen I was speaking to a few of my buddy\u2019s in consulting and some said the test has zero merit or validity it\u2019s simply a formality, others say it\u2019s just a pass fail and if you fail your hiring process ends there and you can never try again your shit out of luck.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week and I haven\u2019t heard from the head of talent attraction. Some of my buddies say they got a phone call the day after they took the test some say it took over a week. \n\nI\u2019m stressing the fuck out why didn\u2019t I just cheat on the memory portion it wasn\u2019t proctored or anything I could have just filmed it. I just figured it couldn\u2019t be that hard. I just genuinely can not believe a job of this caliber could have such a redundant test I can\u2019t believe me failing this stupid exam that\u2019s so removed from what we do for work might have just altered the course of my entire life. \n\nNow I\u2019m not sure if I should just stay put or if I should reach out to the nice lady from talent attraction and be like \u201chey I haven\u2019t heard from you in a few days and I wanted to make sure everything was ok\u201d \n\n\nI am tailor made for this role, everything I\u2019ve ever done has lead up to his job opportunity and to piss it away over a fucking baseline aptitude test has me so unbelievably sick to my stomach. I seriously might have a fucking stroke. \n\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019ve been trying to get this job in consulting for an oil company for the last 9 months. It is my dream job had an amazing interview on the phone then I was sent a test that has zero to do with the oilfield I feel like I bombed the test, I haven\u2019t heard back from the company in a week.

I thought because I worked 90+ hour weeks in private equity for a couple years that I deserved all this money and knew everything. Turns out I barely knew anything in my field until I was in it for a solid 5+ years, and now I make well over $250k. \n\nIf you get the job and make that money, great. But you should not expect $250k 2 years out of college because it is just not realistic for 99% of people. \n\nLastly, your second paragraph is EXACTLY why I think \"consulting\" firms are just a racket. You have superiors literally doing nothing making $300k+ a year while they pawn all their work onto an overworked 24 year old that barely has any experience.",
