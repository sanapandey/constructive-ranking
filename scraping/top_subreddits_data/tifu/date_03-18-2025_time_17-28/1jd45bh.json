    "selftext": "Hopefully this doesn't break any rules, please let me explain!\n\n\nSo I'm a white woman and I. Love. Watermelon. Flavor. I was getting ready for a hike and bought a watermelon flavored energy drink, watermelon flavored gum, watermelon flavored gummies, and watermelon flavored breath mints (did you know that was a thing?? Cause I didn't!)\n\n\nNow, this poor cashier was ringing me up and mentioned that I must love watermelon flavor. Now, this wonderful lady was a black woman. So of course, in a moment of absolute stupidly, my dumbass goes \"Well watermelon is just the best, you know what I mean?\" And I pointed finger guns at her because I'm an awkward bisexual and finger guns is pretty much a requirement for communication with me. \n\n\nThe look on her face immediately snapped my one braincell back into place and I managed to remember that: racism is a thing.... OOPS. I was immediately panicking and apologizing, my face was bright red with embarrassment as she burst out laughing at me. (Though I also would have accepted getting my butt whupped because I 100% would have deserved it)\n\n\nNeedless to say, I need a new gas station to go to cause I obviously can't go back EVER AGAIN. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I tried to make a friendly joke about me loving watermelon to a black woman, forgetting that racism existed.

Like come on, what's actually closer to being racist is the assumption that a black person is liable to immediately devolve into uncontrolled angry violence at the slightest mention of a fruit.",

The n***ers had theirs for such a long long time, I'm white and it's time that I had mine\"\n\nHe was saying that as a southern white man in 1966!!! It's hard for me to wrap my mind around that viewpoint\n\nIt's honestly a great song besides the lyrics, very catchy. It's a good listen if you want to hear reprehensible viewpoints expressed in a hilariously crass and blunt way. Reddit is so sanitized now that I don't even want to post a link, but you can find it on archive.org if you search \"johnny rebel hatin me\"\n\nHe made [one non-racist song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZS8CDoFSIw) during his whole career lmao, the rest are all about hating black people",

Not because they're some how genetically wired to like them (no more than anyone else), but because these were diet staples in the South.

Images of black people eating watermelon is certainly stereotypical, and *can* be discriminatory, but, like images of Italians eating pasta or Poles eating perogies, they're based on popular diets of those people groups, and are not necessarily discriminatory.\n\nThe real implicit racism here is thinking that, because a person is black, they're going to assume someone's a racist for appreciating a food that's popularly known to be part of their historical food culture.",

What are we having?\"\n\n\"Fried chicken,\" I replied sheepishly. \n\nMy sister looked upset. He seemed happy. \"Sounds good! I love fried chicken!\"\n\nThey come inside, and my wife calls out from the kitchen, \"Do y'all want something to drink? I just made some grape Kool-Aid!\"\n\nHe's still good with it. He wants some. My sister is fuming. I avert my eyes. \n\nDinner seems to go well. My sister is tense. It's time for dessert. My wife says, \"I think that watermelon we sliced up and put in the fridge should be nice and cold by now.\"\n\nAt this point, my sister looks like she's about to come unglued. I apologize. I tell him that I swear I just forgot. He laughs it off. He knows that I didn't mean anything by it. \n\nMy sister, on the other hand, still doesn't talk to me. \ud83d\ude02",
