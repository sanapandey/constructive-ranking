    "selftext": "I (24F) have been job-hunting for months, and it\u2019s been brutal. I finally landed a few interviews and had one last week for a company I really wanted to work at. I wore my favorite interview outfit\u2014this perfectly fitted blazer and a pair of slacks that make me feel unstoppable. I nailed the interview and got the job!\n\nEnter my best friend, Mia (25F). She\u2019s also been struggling with job searches and has an interview coming up. I was super excited for her until she hit me with:\n\n\"Hey, can I borrow your lucky outfit for my interview?\"\n\nI was a little caught off guard, but I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable lending it out. Not because I don\u2019t want her to do well, but because:\n\nIt\u2019s my go-to professional outfit for future career opportunities.\nI don\u2019t like lending out clothes I rely on.\nI don\u2019t even believe in \u201cluck\u201d like that.\nShe got super annoyed and said I was being selfish because \u201cI already got a job, and she needs all the luck she can get.\u201d She even tried guilt-tripping me by saying she was \u201cway more desperate\u201d than I ever was.\n\nI told her that while I\u2019d be happy to help her prep, do mock interviews, or even help her pick out her own outfit, I wasn\u2019t comfortable giving her mine. She snapped back with, \u201cWow, I guess your \u2018luck\u2019 is more important than our friendship.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s being cold with me, and a couple of our mutual friends think I should\u2019ve just let her borrow the outfit \u201cfor one day\u201d because it clearly meant a lot to her.\n\nAITAH for saying no?",

A lot of people keep saying it doesn't matter because it's entertaining, but that's not what this subreddit is supposed to be for. The fake posts are drowning out the possibility of real people getting real advice. They're also creating fake narratives that push misogyny, misandry, and bigotry of all sorts. Even the concept of using them to generate karma for new accounts to access other subreddits is a problem, since they're subverting the safety measures those subreddits have in place for a reason. And accounts that want to subvert subreddit restrictions are usually doing it for not great reasons, like spreading misinformation and propaganda.\n\ntl;dr:  AI posts are a bigger problem than many realize and people need to stop upvoting and engaging with them and start downvoting and reporting them.",

For someone who believes so much in luck, she should know that someone's else's lucky charm could be something massively unlucky for her. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, it wasn't a lucky outfit that got you that job. It was doing the necessary prep work, being qualified and feeling confident on the day. An outfit only helps with the last one, and what makes you feel confident is likely different from what makes your friend feel confident. If she truly believes your outfit is 'lucky' then she'll likely be over-confident at interviews, which won't look good for her. So, your outfit could actually make it harder for her to get hired even if you don't believe in luck. \n\nIf your friend wants to increase her chances of getting hired, she needs to apply for jobs she's qualified for, do the research on what the job entails and about the company, prep for the interview, and choose an outfit she likes that makes her feel good, that she owns, not something borrowed. After all, she'll likely need the outfit again at some point, either for more interviews, or for other professional settings if she gets a job. It makes way more sense to find and buy her own 'lucky' outfit than to borrow yours.\n\nPlus, it's yours. No one except you gets to decide what happens to it. If this is your go-to professional outfit that makes you feel good when wearing it, then you really don't want to risk it getting stretched out or damaged in any other way. People are a lot less careful with other people's things than they are with their own. Even if there's no size difference between you and your friend, she's not going to be as careful about spilling something on it or snagging it as she would be with an outfit she owned. \n\nKeep your outfit for when you need it. You've offered a lot of help for interviews, so you're clearly willing to help her succeed. It sounds to me like your friend wants a shortcut, a 'lucky charm', that she can then blame if she doesn't get the job because she was unprepared or over-confident.",
