    "selftext": "I (24F) have a younger brother, Jake (22M), who has been dating his girlfriend, Maya (21F), for about six months. I have no issue with Maya\u2014we get along fine, and she seems like a nice person. But recently, she\u2019s been acting like she\u2019s already part of the family, and it\u2019s starting to get under my skin.\n\nIt started small\u2014she\u2019d call my mom \u201cMom\u201d (which my mom found weird but didn\u2019t correct), she\u2019d refer to our family group chat as \u201cour chat,\u201d and she\u2019d sign cards with \u201clove, Maya & Jake\u201d as if they were a married couple.\n\nI found it a little much, but I let it go\u2026 until last weekend.\n\nMy family was planning a small getaway\u2014just me, my parents, and my brother. We do this every year, and it\u2019s always been a just-us tradition. When we were talking about it, Maya casually mentioned how excited she was for the trip.\n\nI was confused and asked, \u201cWait\u2026 you\u2019re coming?\u201d She looked surprised and said, \u201cYeah, Jake said it\u2019s a family trip, and I\u2019m family now.\u201d\n\nI kind of laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cNo offense, but you\u2019re not family yet.\u201d She looked stunned and just said, \u201cOh.\u201d The conversation got really awkward, and I could tell she was upset.\n\nLater, Jake went off on me, saying I was rude and made her feel unwelcome. I told him that I don\u2019t hate her, but six months isn\u2019t enough to be calling my mom Mom or inserting herself into family-only traditions.\n\nNow my parents are annoyed at both of us\u2014my dad thinks I should have been nicer, but my mom secretly admitted she finds it weird too. Jake is still pissed, and Maya has been distant ever since.\n\nAITAH for telling her she\u2019s not family yet?",

But you could've conveyed that message to your parents and brother instead of her. Be smart with your words. \n\nIf she becomes you sister in law in long run, this event will forever stay in her mind. Always remember that. The precedent you have set. It will forever stay now. This relationship will never be close. That's for sure.",

If she\u2019s got issues in her own family she could be longing for some family inclusion. Or, if that\u2019s how her family is with possible future in-laws, and they welcome them pretty early on, it could also explain if that\u2019s the type of treatment she\u2019s used to giving. \n\nI think some backstory could help to understand her emotions behind it. But at the same time, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s harming anything by wanting to be part of the family, so I\u2019d go a little easier on her.",

We got together once a week for a walking and talking night, and did girls weekends away, Xmas parties, stuff like that.\n\nI met this nice young woman at work and she started to hang out with us.  It wasn't a really good fit.   She's younger than everyone else and at a different stage of life, but I liked her.\n\nThen she started saying things like, \"Now that i have my BFF's forever group\", or \"these girls are my new sisters \".  It was awkward. One does not become lifelong friends with a group of women in just a couple of months.  I told her more than once she was kind of pressuring the other girls to like her more.  \n\nShe just never got the message and ultimately,  we had a tense discussion because the other women just felt weird about how she kept pushing for closer relationships.    At the end of the discussion, we mutually agreed to go our separate ways.  It was awkward and unpleasant. \n\nI don't know your brother's Gf's story, but I think she just really wants to be part of a family.  \n\nI am going to say a gentle YTA, because it could have been handled with more consideration.   Her feelings would have been hurt either way, but really, that is down to her.  She needs to not be quite so clingy.  Maybe she doesn't know how awkward she's making folks feel.\n\nThat being said, now that you're all adults,  the format and frequency of this family trip may have to change to include spouses and long term partners. It is not fair for a family tradition to change to include a new love interest.  More time needs to pass.",
