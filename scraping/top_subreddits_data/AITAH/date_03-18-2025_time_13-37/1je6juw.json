    "selftext": "My sister (28F) has been with her fianc\u00e9 (32M) for three years. She\u2019s always been the more reserved, quiet type, while he\u2019s loud, extroverted, and sometimes a little over-the-top. We tolerated him, but recently, he crossed a serious line.\n\nA few weeks ago, my sister came to me in tears because her fianc\u00e9 had \"pranked\" her in front of his friends by pretending to propose in an elaborate setup, only to laugh in her face and say, \"Just kidding, babe! You really thought I was serious?\" His friends all laughed while she stood there, humiliated.\n\nShe didn\u2019t break up with him (which I think she should have), but she was heartbroken. He later gave her some half-hearted excuse about how he actually had a proposal planned soon and this was just a joke gone wrong.\n\nFast forward to this past weekend at our parents' house. We were having a big family dinner, and he was there, acting like nothing happened. While chatting, someone asked when they were getting married, and before my sister could answer, he smirked and said, \"Guess she\u2019ll just have to wait and see, huh?\"\n\nThat was it for me. I smiled sweetly and said, \"Oh, is this like how she had to wait for that hilarious fake proposal in front of all your friends? That was so funny, right? Let\u2019s all have a good laugh about it now.\"\n\nThe table went dead silent. My sister looked mortified, but my parents looked pissed at him. He stammered something about it being a joke, but my dad straight-up told him, \"That\u2019s not a joke. That\u2019s cruelty.\"\n\nHe left shortly after, and now my sister is mad at me for \"embarrassing him and making things worse.\" I told her he embarrassed her first and deserved to be called out. My parents are backing me, but my sister says I\u2019ve ruined things for her.\n\nAITAH?",

I realise how abusive and manipulative this is and haven't done it since. \n\nInstead I'm being very clear in my language now when I pay compliments, which I do a lot and honestly because I NEVER ever want ppl I like to feel insecure and unsafe with me.

He's not just a douche, he's surrounded by similar douches and they'll make him spiral worse than if he had good ppl around him.\n\nI'd dump him so fast, have to say. And your dad was spot on.

Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men' by Lundy Bancroft. Read it with her. Hopefully, it will open her eyes to the red flags she has been dismissing.\n\nIf he was capable of doing something that cruel, I don\u2019t even want to imagine what\u2019s coming next.

It's just that it's not going to work and is more likely to have the opposite effect to what you want. \n\nHe's an asshole and your sister should dump his ass.  The core problem here is that she didn't, and docent look like she will.  The best way to get her to do that is to talk to her privately and persuade her, as well as let her know that she is supported and loved regardless of what she chooses. \n\nInstead of doing that, what you have done is created a situation where he hates you, and he's going to make this a \"me or him\" situation.  If she's not ready to leave her abusive relationship, she's going to choose him.  That means that you are not \"there for her\" in the event that she actually wants to leave him.  It means that you're cut out.\n\nLets be clear, this is an abusive relationship and those have some special dynamics that tend to be at play.  When well meaning family members create \"them or me\" situations they do in fact just make things worse, never better.  The person who's being abused feels more alone, not less.  They do not feel incentivized or empowered, they feel further beaten down. \n\nSo to look at your actions and ask, what was it you hoped to accomplish and did those actions accomplish that?  The answer I feel is that those actions pushes you further away from your goal, not closer to it.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, I just think that you've not had to deal with a truly abusive person before and so you might not know what happens.  They WANT to isolate their partners, and what you did pushes her towards being isolated.",
