    "selftext": "I work 12-hour shifts, mostly nights, but on Saturdays, I work day shifts. My boyfriend Ubers to a park near my job, and I drive there after work so he can take over driving since we live 25 miles away, and I\u2019m extra tired from the schedule change.\n\nAt 5:20 PM, my coworker texted me asking if I could cover her shift because her babysitter was having issues. I was busy with my patient and didn\u2019t see it until 5:47 PM. I responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can, I have stuff to do tomorrow that I can\u2019t cancel\u201d (I had Disneyland tickets for my little sister). When she didn\u2019t reply, I followed up with, \u201cCan you let me know if you\u2019re coming in or being covered, please? I have someone picking me up today and don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have to cancel with them too.\u201d She replied that she was on her way, so I said, \u201cOkay, thank you, drive safe,\u201d and thought that was the end of it.\n\nI finish my shift, head to the park where my boyfriend is, and suddenly get hit with this message:\n\n\u201cJust an FYI, count me out on ever covering a shift for you. Especially when you lie about getting picked up today when you clearly had your car. I don\u2019t appreciate liars. I had an emergency with my kids and their babysitter, yet I still managed to come to work. If you want to show this text to Boss or Manager, please feel free to. We can also have a conversation with them in person if you feel attacked. I am not coming at you maliciously. At the end of the day, we are coworkers, and we have to be on the same page for the patient. There will be no ill will or tension on my end, but just as you are not available for coverage, I will no longer be available when you need it.\u201d\n\nI was upset because we\u2019ve never had issues in the past however I tried to be mature, I replied:\n\n\u201cExcuse me? I\u2019m not lying. Not that I have to explain myself to you, but on Saturdays, my boyfriend Ubers down to pick me up so I don\u2019t have to drive home exhausted. I\u2019m not sure where the hostility is coming from?\u201d\n\nShe kept calling me a liar because she saw my car. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014this coworker has been late to shifts so many times. I\u2019ve waited up to 4 hours for her to show up because she had things going on with her kids. I\u2019ve covered her shifts, swapped shifts, and the only times I\u2019ve called off in 3 years were during the LA fires when I wasn\u2019t sure when/if I\u2019d have to evacuate, and once when I had food poisoning (and even then, I gave over 12 hours\u2019 notice).\n\nSo\u2026 what would you do in this situation? How should I handle it? Do you think I was in the wrong at all? I personally don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019m open to hearing different perspectives. Let me know your thoughts!\n",

You are nicer than you needed to be already, she is acting inappropriately aggressively to a coworker. She's not your boss and can't punish you for not covering for her",

Tell her that, if yall are so close say i can\u2019t cancel. The cherry on top though is that you never called out in 3 years but you keep covering her.
