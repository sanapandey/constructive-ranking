            "body": "A quick guide on spotting the AI comments that are shitting up the sub, because the mods sure don't do anything to stop them\n\n1. The comment contains something like \"It's understandable...\", \"It's Reasonable...\", \"It sounds like...\", \"It's unfortunate that...\" before briefly summing up the main post. These sound generic enough to be normal, but you'll soon spot the pattern that bots use these phrases in almost all of their comments.\n\n2. Overly formal punctuation. The average person isn't going to use an em dash or a semi-colon in such an informal setting.\n\n3. Will every so often post a crappy repost with a very generic title in a meme sub to make them seem like a real user.\n\n4. Porn bots will have a username like Sexy<femininename>, Lusty<femininename>, Pretty<femininename>.",

Often this is quicker than anyone could have reasonably read the post and composed a response.\n* Their comment history will show several comments across various posts one minute after each other. Again, too quick for any human to be contributing in good faith.\n* Their comment history will be submitting cute animal posts in other subs to try and farm easy post karma.\n* Their comment history will have posts to subs which evaluate an account's 'Contributor Quality Score'.\n* The em-dash is for some reason a favourite of ChatGPT. But some spammers circumvent the formal punctuation by obviously prompting the LLM to respond with deliberately bad grammar (e.g. no capital letters, swapping 'you' with 'u'). So watch out for that as well.\n* The main tell is how **fucking bland** the comment is. If you read a comment and think 'god that was obvious and boring', it was probably an LLM. An LLM will almost always finish a comment with a call for 'open communication' or some bland platitude that 'communication is key'. And to add to the phrases that you've already pointed out, watch out for 'Your feelings are valid'.\n\nNow, of course there is a danger that people laying out all of the tell-tale signs will just get the spammers to tweak their approach. But fundamentally you cannot wash the LLM stench off these comments. You will always be able to tell.",

            "body": "First time making a Reddit post but here goes.\n\n  \nSo my good friend from Tijuana had been having a hard time with a recent breakup and invited me (24 M) and a couple of guy friends from San Diego to come down to TJ and party at one of his neighbor's house for halloween. Little context, I was born and raised in Tijuana and have been moving back and forth between SD and TJ since 15-16 years old. Both of the friends who I crossed with to go to the party are also Mexican but were born in the U.S., barely speak spanish and seldom travel to TJ, if at all. \n\n  \nWe get to the party and start having a good time in our friend's neighbor's garage, my two friends are knocking it out of the park with some girls who barely speak english and I'm making friends with some of the other people at the party, all regular. At some point I notice a couple of guys approaching one of my friends and telling him a couple of things in spanish that sound like regular TJ banter, something like \"Ay man you fucked up?\" \"Yeaaaah he's fucked up huh?\". My friend wasn't more drunk than anyone else at the party and my suspicion is these guys were probably a bit jealous that this girl they knew and walked into the party with is talking to some American dude who barely speaks spanish. One thing leads to another and I hear my friend clearly tell both of these guys, one of whom is Lebanese and does understand English \"I'll beat the fuck out of both of you right now\". At this point the other friend who we crossed with and I hear this and approach all three of them trying to diffuse the situation. I pull my friend away from the group and tell him it's best if we go because we're guests in the house, we should avoid any fights and most importantly, we're not in the U.S., things can take a turn for the worst very quickly here in Tijuana and we don't know who these guys are or who they know. He agrees with me and we both start walking to the front gate to leave the house but it's locked.\n\n  \nIt's here that things become challenging because our other friend who was trying to stop the scuffle pulls up and tells us he's really fucking pissed and we need to leave asap. At this point the Lebanese dude pulls up on us at the front gate and continues to talk shit in both English and Spanish. At this point I'm genuinely assuming my friends are gonna put this guy to sleep but thankfully our mutual friend (the one who invited us) walks in with his neighbor to open the gate for us. As soon as she opens the gate I drag both of my American friends out and we start walking to our TJ friend's house. While walking I realize that our TJ friend is not walking with us and he went back into the house with the hostess. I tell my friends that I'll go get him and be right back. Both of them disagree with me and say they also want to back into the party to put hands on the Lebanese guy and his friend for talking shit. I tell them we're not doing that and they're going to wait for me here in the street while I get our friend from the party. One of my friends (the only who was approached by both guys) starts walking back to the neighbor's house, at which point I grasp his shoulders push him back and tell him he's not getting past me. He looks at me a bit distraught and glances at our friend while simply taking a step back. I realize he won't want to try that again and our other friend says \"I'm going back in the party\" and takes a few steps forward. I side step into his path and tell him \"No you're not bro, ya'll aren't going back in that party\" at which point he declares \"Who's gonna stop me? Watch me just walk in the house right now\". It's here that I lose a bit of my composure, take my glasses off, toss them on the asphalt and tell him \"If you feel like fighting someone let's go, put your hands up, but you're not walking back into that party\" and continued \"Let's shoot the fade right here and be done and go home\". He steps back and looks at me with a face of surprise and disgust and tells me I'm tripping for not having his back and wanting to fight him.\n\n  \nAfter a small moment of silence and some loud stares they continue walking down the street in the direction of our friend's house. I went back to the party and got our friend back and called it a night. Now he's gone and told the whole wider friend group that I tripped on him and our other friend and that I'm a bitch for not letting him fight some people at a party in TJ and has been portraying me as the bad guy for threatening him. I don't think I'm the asshole but I want to see what reddit thinks. \n\n  \nIf you read through all this mumbo jumbo thank you!",

            "body": "Since I was born, my aunt on my dad\u2019s side has always treated me poorly, and her kids weren\u2019t much better. One cousin even stabbed me with a pencil during a Fortnite argument, leaving a scar. I was blamed for \u201cantagonizing\u201d them when all I did was win. My aunt never disciplines her kids, and my uncle is an alcoholic who beats them. They both do drugs, which I suspect is the only thing keeping their marriage intact.  \n\nA few months ago, I joined a D&D campaign with one of my cousins (C1) and their friends. The first session at my grandparents\u2019 house was fun, but the next one at my aunt\u2019s house took a turn. As soon as I arrived, my aunt and uncle were cold to me. During dinner, C1 invited me to eat, and I thanked them, but my uncle accused me of being rude to C1, even though I\u2019d shown nothing but gratitude. When I tried to leave the table to avoid an argument, he grabbed my arm and yelled, \u201cI\u2019ll put you in your place!\u201d  \n\nTrying to stay calm, I said, \u201cPlease let go of my arm. Do you know who\u2019s watching?\u201d referring to his kids. He didn\u2019t care and tightened his grip. I warned him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my legal guardian. This is kidnapping,\u201d before pulling away and sitting downstairs. I called my mom to pick me up. While waiting, my uncle came downstairs to continue yelling at me, but I refused to argue and stayed quiet.  \n\nWhen my mom arrived, I left, but when I got home, I was told I was in trouble. Confused, I found out my aunt had lied about something I supposedly said (I won\u2019t go into detail). After convincing my mom the claim was false, she confronted my aunt, and her story quickly started falling apart.  \n\nA couple of months later, things escalated again. I was practicing for an esports match at my grandma\u2019s house when my uncle came to pick up his kids. He walked over, ripped off my headphones, and started yelling at me to get off the game and talk to him. Trying to control my breathing (I have asthma), I asked calmly, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d He replied, \u201cBecause I want to talk to you.\u201d I explained I was in the middle of a competitive match and couldn\u2019t quit without consequences, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. He kept calling me disrespectful and compared me to his son (C3), who still lives with my grandma at 21 and joined him in mocking me.  \n\nFrustrated, I packed my things to leave, saying I wouldn\u2019t argue. My uncle followed me to the sidewalk, hurling insults the entire time. He even brought up a traumatic incident from my past, saying, \u201cAt least I\u2019m a great father who didn\u2019t run over my own kid with a lawnmower.\u201d That broke me. I started to tear up as he continued shouting.  \n\nWhen my mom and stepfather pulled up, my uncle got close enough to swing at me. My stepfather sped up slightly, forcing him to back off. I got into the car, but my stepfather almost got out to confront him. My mom stopped him, and we drove off.  \n\nNow I\u2019m home, still processing everything that happened. This occurred in 2022, but I hesitated to post it because I went over the character limit when I first wrote it. (And yes to rewrite it I used ai) So, AITA?",

So i moved to this new school and i made friends with this girl i\u2019ll call her coconut, so me and coconut have been friends since the first day of school and we have a pretty good relationship but starting maybe a few months ago i had a crush on this boy lets call him sonic. Me and sonic had slight conversation with each other but nothing that serious, so i told coconut about how i liked him and stuff and at the time she had a bfn. So maybe a few weeks later she and her boyfriend were having problems so she started fake dating sonic, she was acting like i didnt like him and stuff. She was also saying that i would be weird if i dated someone younger than me cause he is younger than both of us by a single year. So after her and her boyfriend broke up she started dating him, so i tried to ignore it by talkin to someone else i kinda liked.   \n\nNow its like october, and she was telling me about one of my friends liking me and i had a slight crush on him but it wasn\u2019t anything major so i didn\u2019t really care, she also started being really rude this month like yk how theres that one friend that wants to embarrass you in front of other people, thats how she was. my friend thought i had like some major crush on him cause i brought him snacks and sometimes i still do but besides that one day i had like some candy i was gonna give to him and she was like \u201comg he doesn\u2019t like you like calm down\u201d. i didn\u2019t even like him anymore at that point. and when she said it she was being really loud.  \n\nthis also brings me to how rude she is, like me her and a couple of other friends were otp and she was literally only being mean to me, like this boy i kinda like was just saying hey to me and she literally told only me to shut up and she was being rude calling me big and saying how i eat almost everything, but really in reality i bring food for myself at schools and i dont even get to eat it cause she eats it and when i dont bring food for her she gets upset, but like she\u2019s only being rude to me. then we went out to eat for her birthday and she was saying how i was gonna order all the food and stuff btw this was around the end of november.\n\nthen the same boy i was talking about, we started talking and it was like a talking stage and stuff and she kinda knew we were talking cause of the way we interacted and come to find out they started dating like beginning of this month and like i only found out the were cause they posted each other, and now i have to go back to school knowing their together and idk what to do cause i still like him.",

            "body": "Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. My boyfriend and I used to smoke. I quit about a year ago and took up vaping. We used to smoke inside his place all the time. At my place, we would smoke outside because my roommate does not like smoking indoors or outdoors, but he would prefer it be outdoors. He also doesn\u2019t smoke. My boyfriend\u2019s roommate smokes inside, but his boyfriend does not smoke.\n\nMy boyfriend just got a puppy\u2014well, he\u2019s a year old today\u2014but he still smokes all the time around him, with the windows shut and no air purifier or anything. I think that\u2019s disgusting, but it\u2019s his place and really, it\u2019s his dog, so what can I say? I hate nagging him all the time, telling him he smells and should open a window. I feel like I\u2019m talking to a brick wall\u2014he just doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s older than me and was recently diagnosed with COPD, yet still smokes a pack a day.\n\nSometimes he will leave a cigarette burning in the ashtray, and it will burn out completely without him even taking a drag. This makes me so mad because he\u2019s not only poisoning the air for himself, but for me and the puppy as well. What for? I\u2019m starting to resent him for this, and I feel like I\u2019m the asshole because we used to smoke together. I used to smoke a pack every couple of days and would love to smoke inside at his place\u2014this was before the puppy came into the picture. But I have a dog too, and I didn\u2019t want my dog near cigarette smoke.\n\nOn top of this, he also uses Febreze religiously, and I know everyone claims it\u2019s safe, but I do not like it. I have sensitivities to strong smells and get a raging headache whenever the scent is too fragrant. Also, he likes to spray paint inside and use Varsol indoors. He\u2019ll waterproof his shoes with a spray can\u2014probably that Teflon stuff\u2014with no windows open and not a care in the world for me or his new puppy, whose lungs are still developing. I\u2019m writing this, and my blood is boiling just thinking about it.\n\nI could just leave, I know, but I do care for the guy. He may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but that was kind of the stupid charm that made me fall for him. But it\u2019s wearing thin when he\u2019s putting my life and the puppy\u2019s life in danger\u2014of cancer or who knows what else. I just feel so poisoned when I come over to his place, and it breaks my heart because I love this puppy so much. I feel powerless to do anything that can affect real change or protection.\n\nI did get a tower air purifier and a mini room air purifier. I always open windows and doors, have fans going, and even started wearing N95 masks again whenever he smokes, but they don\u2019t exactly make those for dogs... I\u2019ve been trying to teach the dog to run away whenever he lights a cigarette\u2014still a work in progress. I\u2019ve asked him to smoke outside, but he refuses. I have asked him not to spray anything while I\u2019m over, or at least not near me. I know I\u2019m not going to do anything drastic, but maybe I should. Maybe I am overreacting; maybe I am the asshole.\n\nI will probably just continue to nag and make small changes around here, but is there something I\u2019m missing? Should I just mind my own fucking business? I\u2019m not trying to control him or anyone, I just want to be free to breathe normally. I think I will end up not coming over as much, but the puppy... I\u2019m not going to steal the pup or try to rehome it, although maybe the dog might be better off.\n\nOkay, ramble vent over. If anyone has opinions, advice, suggestions, something nice to say, or criticism of me, bring it on, please.",

Late in our relationship, I  suspected he may have been cheating on me or at the very least messaging women online. 2 months after I gave birth to our daughter, I found messages to another woman on his phone- yes I snooped.  We stayed together for 4 more years- did couples counseling and split up in 2022.  I moved out with our daughter- he was always allowed to see her and he was a present father.  She adores him to pieces.  We have gotten to the point where she spend 3 nights a week at his place; I do miss her, but he loves her as well.  On occasion he and I have been intimate, and had unprotected sex. We actually became pretty good friends and were able to spend time as a family often.  That has dwindled, but we actually planned to have sex sometime soon.  We also travel every year since 2019 to south america to visit his birthplace- his family owns a condo there.  It is beautiful and he invites me even though we are no longer together.  Since we separated, I no longer snoop on his phone.  I told him if he ever is with another woman, I do not want to have sex with him because I prefer to be monogamous; of course he agreed.  While we were in south america this year, 2025, my phone broke and he said I could use his.  I video chatted with my mom to let her know I was safe and that my phone was broken.  And then I snooped.  On his whatsapp account- I discovered he was paying $300-$400 for prostitutes AND requesting not to use a condom.  I am sick to my stomach.  He was still planning to have sex with me after having unprotected sex with prostitutes.  My concern is that he is inviting these women to his home- where my daughter stays 3x a week and he may have given me an STD.  AITA if I call him out this and not let my daughter stay overnights with him? I want to keep her safe, but I don't want to ruin her routine or have to explain this to her- because how can I explain to a 6yo that her dad most likely needs help and is a douchebag?",

The thing is, my brother (18M), who didn\u2019t even finish middle school, doesn\u2019t help me at all.\n\nLast summer, my partner invited me to meet his family on the other side of the country, and I accepted. During that summer, my mom had to go to the ER because her heart was vibrating \u2014 she\u2019s hypertensive, and I got scared. She called me crying from the hospital saying she needed help to get home, that she was sedated and didn\u2019t like being in those situations alone. I told her to ask my brother for help, but my brother was too busy drinking at a bar.\n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t do anything; it\u2019s a 12-hour trip, and she just says I see her as a bother for asking my brother to help. Now, every time she gets a chance, she throws it in my face, saying I left her alone during an important moment, as if I knew she\u2019d end up in the hospital.\n\nWhat bothers me is that my brother, who doesn\u2019t work or study and didn\u2019t even finish high school, never gets told to do something or help. He called me needing me to pay a bill via the bank, and I told him I was busy and to ask my brother. He got mad. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the idiot or just being dramatic.",

            "body": "AITAH for letting someone know them cancelling on me made me feel resentful?\n\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on myself over the years around self-love, self-acceptance and self-worth. I\u2019ve been learning how to create healthy boundaries and letting others know how I feel about things that upset me rather than just putting up with it or going silent and disappearing from their lives. Now, I know that there are times we need to postpone or cancel events but this person knew I had issues around people cancelling last minute or being stood up altogether. I used to not say anything and then never make plans with them again. But I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s good to let people know how you feel and that\u2019s how you maintain healthy boundaries and develop good relationships. \n\nThis friend had been one I had been silent with for a long time because of something she said that made me uncomfortable. After I\u2019d done my therapy, I did reach out to her and thought I\u2019d mended our friendship. I thought things were going well. She also knew how I had a problem with people cancelling on me at short notice and also standing me up after I went about organising things. \n\nShe had been going through a trying time back in November and I suggested we have a self-care day which she was over the moon about. She already had two days scheduled off so I said I\u2019d take holiday days and we planned our day. The day before our scheduled day, she cancelled so she could go to a job interview. We could have met up after the job interview but she said she needed the day. I ended up finding something to do on my own since it was too short of notice to cancel my days off or find someone else to do something with. I was gracious about it and let it go but let her know I was disappointed. \n\nThen in December she mentioned she wanted a makeover and wanted to talk to my hairdresser. We decided we could meet up before my scheduled appointment with my hairdresser, have some brunch and then she could have her consultation. It was just after the New Year on a Saturday, so I booked a reservation at a very popular tearoom and also booked my hairdresser to give her a consultation on a makeover. She cancelled the night before siting family drama and needing to get ready for her new job that would begin on Monday. \n\nI kept the reservation and ended up having a nice brunch by myself before my appointment and I had to apologise to my hairdresser. Even though she fit me in earlier than my appointment, it meant she lost time at the end where she might have been able to fit someone in. \n\nAnyway, I let her know how I felt some resentment and didn\u2019t want to hold it so that we could progress in our friendship and she brought up how I\u2019d gone silent before, how I just popped up again with warning and how I knew she was going through things and then she finished by saying \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be going through another period of silence. Thanks for letting me know. Peace and love.\u201d\n\nAITA for letting her know what upset me instead of going silent or just letting her carry on without knowing what made me feel upset?",

            "body": "Alr yall aitah for \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of my roommates. \n\nBackstory:\nMy fiance (21 m) and I (20f) are friends with this couple we will call them Jake (21m) and Cassie (20f). My fiance has been friends with Jake since they were in middle school and I became pretty close with his girlfriend. Anyways cut to the chase they found out they were pregnant and they didn\u2019t live in the best household to raise a kid. (Fleas, mold, roaches, broken ac/ heat) so we offered to get a place with them and help them out. When we all found a place we really liked we all agreed to pay a certain amount and Cassie didn\u2019t have a job but said she would have one by move in date. (My first mistake). My fiance and I put our names on the lease and they moved into the apartment with us. The rent is 1650 (included a brand new washer and dryer, valet trash all that fun stuff). We have WiFi which is $50 a month and electricity bill which isn\u2019t a fixed rate. We agreed to all pay 450 plus throw in for groceries.\n\nWhen we moved in Cassie still didn\u2019t have a job and just layed around all day, which is fine bc she\u2019s pregnant. However once it started to become an issue when my fiance and I paid for all the groceries and household items. We bought the couch, tv, and everything needed for the living room. It got to the point where we paid 2100 for everything in the first month (including our rent) and bills. They agreed to just send 800 to cover their rent which we would still be covering a little of theirs plus WiFi. However we got a bill for electricity that was way higher and asked for $50 extra to help us pay it. They stated we were taking advantage of them and everyone thinks so bc they have to pay $800 for themselves (we paid the other $850 and every grocery in the house) but they don\u2019t cook so they depended on me to cook for everyone. Once we got onto our 4th grocery haul I stopped buying snacks because I could never get them. They were always brought to their room and I wasn\u2019t being sent any money for the grocers and they stated they only needed to truely pay for $600 a month in rent and the extra $200 was for groceries and bills. However if it was then it would only pay for 1/4 of the cost of groceries that month. And none of bills or half of bills and none of groceries. \n\nThey also continued having someone over while we weren\u2019t home who tried causing my fiance and I to break up and talked very disrespectfully about me saying horrible lies. My fiance and I make a decent living and DoorDash as date nights for extra money and bring in about 1500 a week. At first the extra payments weren\u2019t terrible bc we thought it would get better. Then they kept going out for dinner and buying things they didn\u2019t need but saying how they couldn\u2019t pay the rest of rent on time. \n\nThey moved out and had the friend who said all that stuff move their stuff out and told us how we took advantage of them and their situation but I don\u2019t see how as we paid for way more and tried to take care of them. So are we the assholes?",

The moving in is both beneficial for me and them as I can charge them lower rent than they would get anywhere else and they can set money aside for a future house. This would benefit me since I can save some money by attributing their rent to a portion of my mortgage. I texted my sister asking if she and her boyfriend would sign a roommate agreement just stating how much they would have to pay for rent and when as well as chores that would need to be done between all of us equally around the house and just any legal coverage in case anything bad was to happen. Sam is an ex-addict and Maggie lived with another sibling of ours before and they mentioned how messy both Maggie and Sam might be. \n\nWell Maggie thinks I\u2019m over thinking and stressing about everything and didn\u2019t like it at first but I ultimately began to convince her it\u2019s a simple agreement about rules and chores that we can fall back on in the future just in case and it\u2019ll help handle things or situations that might come up later. But Maggie told Sam and according to her it upset Sam and he takes it as offensive, he specifically said \u201cwhat? we\u2019re not kids I know how to take care of myself and act. Your sister (me) is doing too much.\u201d So now both of them are unsure about the agreement. \n\nI\u2019m a very logical person and know everything is not always sunshine and rainbows, I know that even though we\u2019re sisters we will disagree with things and argue because we are two different human beings. I also wrote a clause that we would sit together once a month and discuss any issues we might have and figure how to remedy any problems. I just don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re making it seem like such a bad thing. If roles were reversed I would understand signing it. So AITAH?",

That a late fee will be added daily until their rent is paid. On top of that, you need to write how chores will be distributed and that if they do not keep up with rent and chores, they will be given a 30-day eviction notice. \n\nIf they won't sign it then they so not move in. It is not your job or responsibility to home your sister and her addict boyfriend. You already know they are slobs. Why bother adding to you problems? Your sister bring s a baby into your home, you realize she will use her baby as an excuse for why she can't hold up her end of the bargain right?  Do not be foolishness and think they will be there for a year, you are looking at multiple years. That's even if they ever save up for their own home. \n\nWhy would they? They have yours. Again, I have to say do not allow your sister to move in. This I a multi year ask. Depending on their jobs and saving ability it could be 5 years or longer. They need to pay for daycare and that isn't cheap. Depending where you live could rub as high as $3,000 a month. If you work at home she could try and sell you on the idea that you could do both, do your job and watch her baby. No you cannot. Both are full-time jobs. So unless your sister is paying you as her daycare provider to make it worth your while when you get fired, the answer is no.",

            "body": "AITAH for fighting for a forbidden love?\n\nHello Guys! Actually this is my first post, but I'm dying to know that AITAH for fighting for a forbidden love. I won't use real names for the sake of privacy.\n\nSo, the backround:\nI (19, male) started working at a psychiatry unit in mid June 2024 as I got my nursing degree. At the unit, one of my co-workers (43, female) has been (and again, still is) in a relationship with a guy (48, male) and has a daughter (7, female). The daughter is not from this current boyfriend (from now on let's call him Trevor). In the end of November, they broke up, and my co-worker (from now on let's call her Evelyn) asked me if I have some free time watching over her daughter (let's call her Natalie), and I said yes. She asked me right away how much do I ask an hour to babysit Natalie, but I said it's completely free as I can actually profit from having a co-nurse with one less problem to think about, She'll have more efficiency if she won't think about how to solve her babysitting.\n\nSo, Evelyn called me to go to a pizza place so we can discuss details, where we talked about everything except watching over her daughter. After about a week, she calls me up to her apartment to have some drinks, and after a bottle of wine, she tells me she wants to kiss me which I refused since we're co-workers and it would ruin everything between us. After that comment, I went home right away, and the next day, she calls me over again, promising me that she won't do it again. We drank more this time, and I accepted the kiss which led us making out. After that, since now we both made a mistake, we promised eachother that we won't talk about it, but we continued this type of behaviour, we only left out the drinking part.\n\nAfter about one week, I hate to admit it but I actually fell in love with her despite her age is almost the same as my mother's. I told her because I have never lied about anything in front of her or any other co-workers, I seen them as my friends since they instantly accepted me despite having very little experience in nursing given by I only got out of nursing school. We started making plans for the holidays, and after that we discussed how we'll bring this situation to her daughter, after all, Natalie is closer to me in age than Evelyn. I argued many times with my family because they knew this would happen, they always told me that she's just using me, but at the time due to the pink cloud or whatever, I didn't see this would come. And now, they refuse to even talk to me over phone. She opened up to me about her problems and we always found solutions, (that are actually worked, and I honestly impressed about that I could pull that off with my 19 years of age) and I always managed to calm her soul down.\n\nAfter that, in about 2 weeks, she confesses me that Trevor actually went back to her because he spent all his money on gambling and she accepted him back. I'm not going to lie, it hurt me so much.\n\nAfter a week of desperate trying to get her back by any means necessary, (I know my methods weren't the best, like blackmailing Trevor, trying to bribe him, telling Evelyn that Trevor is already cheating on her (which is actually true btw) etc...) She told our Chief Nurse about how I want to be with her despite nothing happened between us other than she tells me when I need to watch over Natalie and giving me the money for it. Note here that everyone knew I haven't accepted any amount of HUF for it.\n\nEveryone knew me enough that if I can help, I do it without waiting for anything in return. Anyways, I snapped, I made the huge mistake of telling everything to one of my Co-workers. She told my story to the chief nurse, who offered me two ways. I can either leave, or they fire Evelyn. I chose the second option given by the fact that while I watched over her daughter, she told me she wants me as her new step-dad, which made the outcome so much more hurtful.\n\nSo basicly right now, I sit here with severe depression combined with self-unaliving thoughts, without ways to make things right with her, without a job, without money, without my family and what hurts the worst is that Now I sit here without the woman I'd give my life for, and without her daughter who wanted me as her new step-dad and who I actually loved babysitting since we could play anything due to our small age diference.\n\nSo, the question still stands, AITAH for fighting for a forbidden love that was always one-sided?",

Only I said like \"just as like at the end of the day there comes the night, after the night comes a new day\" Yet this night or tunnel seems too long to walk trough without a flashlight...\n\nBut you're right, I got warned even by her best friend (48, Female, she worked with us too) I should've been more careful with her. So many people said that she jumps from man to man, she goes to bed with almost every boy she knows, Yet I was probably blinded by the alcohol. And after that, I was feeling a sense of guilt to actually make love with her, that's why I let it happen multiple times. And that led me to actually fall in love with her.\n\nAnyways, you're still right, I should move on, the only thing that I have to solve is how to forget her... The problem with me that so many people pointed out to me, is that I'm too loyal for my age. I've never cheated on anyone, I never thought of it, would never hurt anyone's feelings unless absolutely necessary for their happines, And I can't easily let anyone go who I love even if they are a friend only. I only want someone who is as loyal as I am... yet in my generation, it seems impossible, but it looks like the problem isn't my generation, but the fact is that if I say to someone I love them, Then that's that.

As a 29-year-old woman, I can understand how intense feelings can cloud judgment, especially when you\u2019re young and experiencing a deep connection for the first time. It sounds like you genuinely cared for Evelyn and her daughter, but the power dynamics, age gap, and workplace relationship made this situation complicated from the start.\n\n\nEvelyn crossed professional and personal boundaries by pursuing something with you in the first place. It\u2019s understandable that you fell for her, but her actions (especially bringing Trevor back despite his behavior) showed that she wasn\u2019t in the same place emotionally or mentally as you. It\u2019s painful, but not all love is meant to be fought for \u2013 especially when the other person isn\u2019t reciprocating fully or acting in a way that respects your feelings.\n\n\nI think you made decisions based on hurt and heartbreak, but that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person \u2013 just human. Right now, it might feel like everything is falling apart, but this could be the start of finding better, healthier relationships. Take some time to heal and focus on yourself. You clearly have a kind heart and a willingness to help others, which will serve you well in the long run. Don\u2019t let this experience make you feel like you aren\u2019t worthy of love and respect. You are.",

            "body": "AITA for feeling guilty about not stopping my dad this time?\n\nFor as long as I can remember, my parents\u2019 relationship has never been healthy. Ever since I was a tween, I\u2019ve seen them fight\u2014screaming at each other, blaming each other, and making home an uncomfortable place to be. A few years back, my dad threatened to leave, and I got really scared. No child wants their parents to separate, so I begged him to stay. Ever since then, I took on the role of mediator in their fights. My dad would always put all the blame on my mom, and I would tell her to just accept it because I felt like there was no other way to keep the peace. What else could I have done?\n\nBut in the last couple of years, things have gotten worse. My dad started using our fear as a weapon\u2014making scenes in front of others, threatening to leave, threatening to kill himself, even blaming his own poor health on us. He would pretend to faint after one of his anger outbursts to get sympathy. Whenever he got mad, he would start slapping himself aggressively until his face turned red. It was terrifying to watch.\n\nThe final straw happened in December. It was a normal morning, and I woke up because he needed help with work. My mom gave a simple opinion about something, and he exploded in rage\u2014even though the conversation wasn\u2019t serious at all. And then, out of nowhere, he escalated things. He grabbed a knife from the kitchen and held it to his wrist, threatening to kill himself. Then he started talking about separation again.\n\nThis time, my mom finally snapped and said, Fine, go ahead. I can\u2019t deal with this daily stress of waking up and living every day knowing you make my life miserable. Normally, this would be the moment where I stepped in, calmed things down, and told my mom to just take the blame so he would stop. But this time, I couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t know what held me back, but I didn\u2019t say a word.\n\nWhen he realized I wasn\u2019t jumping in to defend him, he got furious. He yelled at me, What kind of daughter are you? I had just turned 18 recently, and he blamed it on that\u2014saying that I suddenly didn\u2019t need him anymore and that I had brainwashed my mom against him. He even called my mom\u2019s cousin to come over, hoping someone would side with him. But this time, I lost it too. In front of everyone, I asked him, Have you ever slapped mom? (Because I have seen him do it with my own eyes.) Have you ever pulled her hair? Held her arm so tight it left bruises? Instead of answering, he completely ignored the questions and went straight back to blaming my mom\u2014saying that she made him lose his temper by having her own opinions.\n\nI told them I believe separation is the best decision. And for the first time ever, no one stopped him from leaving. He packed his bags and said he would never come back, that we would all see his \u201cvalue\u201d once he was gone. But he stalled for hours, waiting for someone to beg him to stay. When no one did, he actually left.\n\nIt has been two months since then. Instead of trying to fix anything, he has spent his time calling all of our relatives, making a huge scene, and painting my mom as the villain. He has said she is too weak to survive without him (especially financially) and that she has been brainwashed by whoever. In the past month alone, he ran back to our home country twice to get emotional support from his parents\u2014the same people he always bad-mouthed behind their backs.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 even though I know I did the right thing, I feel guilty. I miss him. I keep thinking, What if he is actually mentally sick? What if he does something to himself? If something happens to him, I will never be able to forgive myself.\n\nBut at the same time, I know I had to take a stand\u2014not just for my mom, but for my 10-year-old little sister. The fights were already affecting her health, and I noticed something heartbreaking: she didn\u2019t even react to his abnormal behavior anymore. She thought it was normal. But it wasn\u2019t. None of this was. And I couldn\u2019t let her go through the same childhood I did.\n\nWe still haven\u2019t legally finalized the separation, but my mom seems to be in a much better place now. And yet, I can\u2019t shake this guilt.\n\nSo, AITA for not stopping my dad this time?",

For context she has always been a bad friend but I tolerated it because I loved  her as a person and we always had fun Ex: always late..like hours all the time, despite being on  schedule for something or when I flew across the country to visit her and she pretty much blew me off the whole time. Anywho, fast forward 20 years she sometimes comes back to our home state and tries to plan visits with way too many people and is constantly changing plans or blowing me off either way..but I still tried and made an effort. I forgot to mention a huge part of our outings revolved around alcohol. Fast forward another 5 years, mind you at this point still texted periodically for birthdays/holidays and saw her a few times too but I am sober now. I do not push my sobriety on anyone and can be around it without being bothered by it, it's my issue not anyone else's. I was dating a real jerk and he was constantly telling me I was fat and I mentioned it too her and the only support I got was \"Well men are visual creatures\" gee thanks for the support. I am not one to even open up to people to begin with. I was also struggling with major depression and eating horribly so it just sucked to have no support. I don't have much support anyway. I left that guy and dropped a ton of weight, but because I left that guy after things got bad, I have been kind of homeless since, not relevant to story but  just stating I was dealing with a lot. I also do pet sitting. She had given my number to an ex of hers to watch his kitty kitty but then started to try to fix me up with him and I was like hell to the no! You guys used to bang, I don't do sloppy seconds(I didn't say it like that ..lol and I was not attracted to him regardless) anyone point being I said no. She gave him my number because of the pet sitting and he proceeded to ask me out. I said no thank you. She was back in town around this time and we finally ended up meeting up after several cancels/reschedules on her end. She has always kind of been obsessed with how I look, I know I said I was fat before but I was always very thin naturally, but I dismissed the comments. I am thin again, so she commented a few times about it..ugh,  I wish people would not comment on other's appearance, unless it is a positive comment.  So we are out to dinner and she is pounding the drinks, again I don't care but she became hurtful with her words. Had she always and I never noticed because I was drunk too? She came out to me as well, and I said I always knew anyway and gave her a hug because I know it was a huge step to say it out loud. So we start talking about dating and how horrible it is with men and she wondered if it would be better with women..lol but then proceeds to say \"You know, you're like a 9 out here but back in(not saying place) you would be a 4\" .....what?? Aren't you my friend and why are you rating me anyway? Da fuk?! So that was like whoa to me as she kept banging the drinks back. So so glad I don't drink anymore. Anyway we say goodnight. A few days later her ex texts me saying she told him how good I looked and asked me out again.  I blocked him and I blocked her. This was a few years ago now, she just left me a voicemail the other day saying she is worried about me and has been trying to reach me, this is the only call I have ever received. I can still see blocked calls on my log. I don't think I am going to reach back out. I think alcohol was our common denominator and I took that out of the equation, so that leaves zero. AITAH if I just leave her wondering about me?",

We\u2019ve had the same argument on a topic for 8 whole months and I trust people too much and trusted people telling me I\u2019m crazy for having allegations of cheating and etc. Since she kept giving me false promises about how much she loved me that she could see a future with us and have kids and etc. I held on because I know I had issues too with avoiding her sometimes because of my addiction getting worse each time just thinking about getting cheated on by her is devastating cause I\u2019ve had it done before with another ex. Going through months of this issue I lost sleep and my job and mental health. Having people that isolated me because of my allegations made me feel like I couldn\u2019t open up to anyone anymore. But I just got over it and opened up the other friends that weren\u2019t as close to me about my situation, but even then I didn\u2019t really get much of any validation and I just felt like I was going crazy. Seeing a bunch of content that were similar to my life story and timeline, it made me question if someone was just being around me to get info to have a \u201cstory\u201d and the stories were similar with our arguments and issues, but the stories were swapped and made me a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and a \u201ccheater\u201d that didn\u2019t know how to communicate and express my emotions and how I was controlling and insecure. Literally that\u2019s what she was, and it\u2019s just sad seeing everyone taking that side of the story. Made me felt like the bad guy that everyone hated and thought was an asshole. I later realized that my phone has been hacked and mirrored, or sim swapped or dual sim, because there\u2019s time that my phone glitches and my screen literally changes, and sometimes control some actions on my phone. Honestly been feeling like I\u2019ve been puppeteered to think of things and to see things to control a \u201cnarrative\u201d later I find out about shadow banning and cloaking that doesn\u2019t allow me to send messages and doesn\u2019t allow people to see my messages. Been listening to a podcast called \u201cthis is actually happening\u201d and a specific episode titled \u201cwhat if they\u2019re delighted in your demise\u201d it gave me some more insight that i was part of a smear campaign. It trips me out because I don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind it, and my phone shows me content that could make me believe it to be certain people, but I feel like it could just be showing me things to falsely blame others. But obviously I don\u2019t want to hurt people I care for, but since I know I have haters, it makes me try to find out what I need to do to protect myself from identity theft and etc. Seeing content about me not \u201cresponding\u201d to messages or whatever made me feel like there must\u2019ve been a lot of things hidden from me because I wasn\u2019t getting responses from people and ai manipulation could copy voices and face features made me not trust anyone even more. My emotions were more torn in real life and didn\u2019t worry much about content cause I know there can be fake content with just a bunch of bots. But yeah really just annoyed that my phone is hacked and it feel\u2019s personal since no one really responds to me.",

BEFORE she even called an ambulance. she was more worried about letting every one know so they would give HER sympathy and fuck whatever that poor girl was feeling. (that's another reason i can't stand her, she always has to have drama and she always spins it so that SHE gets the attention and the \"omg poor you\" bs) \n\nso anyways, we ran into them at DQ last summer (her, her husband and their 2 kids they have together 2boys like 7 & 5 i think) and i was sitting there enjoying my blizzard and just kinda listening to them talk to my husband (because tbh, never liked her husband, either - he's a year older than me and i've known him since school, he's a grade A dumbass). so, they were talking to my husband and i heard them mention the girl, then they complained about her because she tried to kill herself and THEN called her \"a psycho cunt bitch\". i totally just death stared at them until they left. lemme be honest, i didn't say anything then, but that's only because 100% i would have went to jail. they know how i feel about what they said now and idgaf how they 'feel' about it. \n\nso, now thanksgiving is tomorrow and my husband said we should just invite her so she's \"not offended\". i told him idgaf is she's offended, and i hope she is. her and her husband bullied his child, her step child, for having a mental breakdown. instead of offering her love and support, they said they don't want her to come back from the treatment facility, not even for the holidays, they said as far as they cared, she could just stay there forever. instead of showing their child some fucking empathy (and yes she should consider his kids as her own her kids, but you can tell she favors her own over them and always has.) so, internet strangers, would you invite these people into your home, knowing what they said about a child (THEIR CHILD) that had a mental crisis? \n\n  \ntl/dr: sister in law and her husband called his child a \"psycho cunt bitch\" after she damn near killed herself, and didn't want her to go back to their house after she was out of the mental institution. i don't want to invite them for thanksgiving, because fuck them that's why.",

            "body": "I (33F) was mostly raised by my mom. My parents divorced when I was around 10 years old and we lived 1 week at mom, then 1 week at dad's and so on. When I was 14 I moved to my mom 100%, my older brother (36M) had at this time already lived with my mom 100% since 6 months back. So from around the age of 15-ish to 29 I had no contact with my dad bc of manipulation from my mom (I realized this after becoming an adult + meeting my bf). \n\nWhile living with my mom (62F) and brother I always felt like an outsider, they had same interests and conversations went smooth between them. My role was mental caretaker of my mother and the role of the older sibling towards my brother. Why these roles? My mom basically raised my brother as a girl (meaning: he's sensitivive so I had to do the difficult things (like taking our cat to the vet to put her down bc of a sickness) even though I didn't want to, he needs support so he got all her time and mental support, he gets all he wants like Nintendo consoles etc. while I had to buy all my own things, freedom etc.) while I was raised like a boy by her. I was the one she opened up to because \"I could handle it\", I was not allowed to have bad days bc my mom's first question was always \"What have I done now? Am I such a bad mom?\" = emotional manipulation, no one wanted to hear about my interests and more. I felt extremely lonely at home while being bullied at school daily. So yeah....my childhood was a nightmare. \n\nSince I never got any emotional support or attention (that I craved and sadly still do) from my mom I tried this with my dad instead when reconnecting with him. My mom was NOT happy when she found out that I was talking to him again but I was an adult and it was my decision so I ignored her. My dad is really great and even though there were a few things with him during my childhood I have forgiven him even if I have not forgotten it. He actually listens to me, likes my bf, checks in on me and is just calming to be around for me. I also love my step-mom and feel like I can even talk to her about intimate topics (like sex) that I have never done with my mom since I \"became an adult\" at age 11 to take care of my mom. It felt so refreshing and I felt happy talking to both my dad and step-mom. \n\nSo with a bit of backstory (there's too much to cover it all, my life is pretty much a shitshow) so you know a bit about me and my so called family. When I was 30, I was diagnosed with ADD and Asperger's, at age 19/20 or so I was diagnosed with a thyroid disease and not long after that I also found out I had PCOS. All of these are related to genetics and when I got the results for PCOS I confronted my mom about this. She refused to realize she was the one who passed it on to me. She continued denying it and when I got ADD and Asperger's (after my brother got diagnosed with ADHD) I mentioned it again, \"My sickness and diagnoses are all from you and your side of the family. You have the same thyroid issue and even though you won't admit it you have PCOS too. You knew about the thyroid thing so why did you create kids when it was genetical and we were at high risk?\" Her response: \"I wanted children, your dad wanted as well and I thought you would be safe from it, I didn't know\". Me: \"If you didn't know why didn't you look shit up??? This decision of yours have and still is fucking up my life daily!! I know I can't take care of a baby bc of my ADD so I made the decision to have the surgery but IF I wanted to have kids I would research about my own conditions just because I care and want them to have a good life without too much trouble! Therefore I would decide NOT to have kids even if I wanted them because I thought about their life first, NOT my own!\" (This happened years ago but I can't let it go which is why I am LC with her and NC with my brother)\n\nSo, AITA for blaming my mom for all my sicknesses, diagnoses and mental issues because she never cared, manipulated me and had me even when she had genetical sicknesses and didn't care about her offspring's life?",

I was once the 3rd worst case of Crohn's in the country, with my brother in seat #1, and I also have my fair share of other diseases and disorders, including multiple mental health diagnoses.\n\nYou started this with the story, not the question, and the way the question is posed suggests that you need to do some healing.   \n  \nI think that you're more looking for validation online that you're NTA like it will ease your brain and offset some of your feelings/anxiety and allow you to move forward, when in reality, regardless of your mom's genetic history, you are here and have the cards dealt.\n\nIt's up to you to play your hand as best as possible, as it is mine. While I wish my parents had been more cautious with having kids, how can I expect them to know they needed genetic testing? Most people were not properly diagnosed or had the tools we do today to just Google or ChatGPT some shit; however, I understand your anger and have been in that same place before.\n\nYou need to stop dwelling on this because you're trying to blame/find reason in a situation that is no longer affected by your mom. You have your dad back, cut her off, and said how you feel - you can't do anything else but learn how to control your symptoms and find a job that allows you to support yourself through the ebbs and flows -- I suggest something online, and remote, so if you are down a day or two you can at least do the minimum and keep a position.   \n  \nIf your mom continued to treat you like shit, yah, cut her off completely and don't look back. HOWEVER, it would be best if you also internalized that blaming others isn't a save-all and isn't going to bring the change/validation you're seeking; only you can grab the wheel and use your strengths and knowledge to move forward",

I know logically that I'm here and I just have to handle the symptoms the best I can and make my life better in all the ways I can. However whenever I have a bad day (atm pretty often) the thoughts keep coming back and I don't know what to do. I have been in different kinds of therapy (tried 15 different different psychologists) like Cognitive behavior therapy and so on but nothing has worked. I'm not even sure right now what therapy is for and what you should talk about seems nothing seems to work so maybe I'm explaining things wrong to the one I'm meeting?\n\nI'll do my best to try to improve my life (which I already have to a point) but not sure what to do about the mental stuff and thoughts from earlier in life that effects me.",

            "body": "AITAH For going low contact with my parents \n\nI(21F) have been going through some things with my family and need some help. For some content, I lived with my father (55M), my stepmother (53F), and my two sisters (23F and 15F). To start, I have never gotten along with my stepmother. we always clashed, and she would find problems with everything me and my older sister, and I did eventually leading to my sister moving out. Our arguments got so bad at times that she would get physical with me. To make matters worse, my father would always choose her side to 'save face'.\n\nGrowing up me and my older sister and I always had to follow rules: No phones till the age of 13, and every Friday, we had to clean the whole house after school. My SM brought horses when I was 6 years old, and every weekend was spent at the yard looking after the horses even if we were unwell. That all changed when my younger sister was born. Now I do want to say I never had a problem with my little sister as I know this isn't her fault but the clear show of favouritism still hurt, all the rules I've listed above never applied to her. She never helped clean, and she had a phone by the age of 6, which frustrated me. \n\nWhen it came to our school work, my father would she praise my sisters for their work. My older sister is an amazing artist, and she was allowed to have her art up on the walls through the house. My little sister got any kind of score on a test, and she was given treats and money. As for me, I once told my dad that I got 100% on an exam, which I was really proud of, he didn't even look at my test and said \"couldn't I have done better\" which really crushed me. When I finally spoke to him about it, he made the excuse that he could show he was proud of me because it would get to my head. Another instance was when I showed an interest in becoming a chef my dad told me he would support me all the way then later changed his mind after he had a conversation with my SM that I wasn't aloud to go to a culinary college anymore. \n\nAfter I finished school, I tried to find a job so I could move out because to me, my parents were toxic. I met my now fianc\u00e9 (22M) back in 2021, which my SM wasn't happy with because he lived across the country. She started making sly comments saying that we wouldn't last long or that he would like someone of my 'size'. When she realised her comments weren't working, she started trying to pick fights with me. The final straw was when I requested to stay home because I wasn't feeling well. My SM started shouting at me, throwing insults at both me and my fianc\u00e9. At that point, my MIL . that I should move in with them in fear of my safety, which I did. \n\nAfter I moved away, I tried to keep in contact with my dad as I felt guilty for leaving the way I did but every time I called he sounded like I was annoying him so I cut down the calls. To the point that we only talk during important events like birthdays and Christmas. Recently, I've been talking to my sisters a lot, but every call has turned into a guilt trip session with them telling me that I'm hurting my dad by not calling him, even tho he never calls me to see how I am. \n\nSo AITAH for going to contact my parents?\n\nI do apologise if this is confusing and give any extra context if needed",

I also suggest installing WhatsApp on her iPad/phone. She can still connect with her friends but ideally keep up good grades and the time outside.",

He didn\u2019t invite the wives, he didn\u2019t tell anyone I would be there and I was extremely uncomfortable as they were all heavily drinking screaming at Tvs and betting and not really including me. After about an hour of this behaviour I went upstairs to remove myself from the situation and ended up changing my flight to go home a day earlier. Mind you I also spoke to my boyfriend regarding the fact I\u2019m trying to slow down my drinking as a whole. The following day after the party he blew up that I was leaving a day earlier and how selfish I was. And then he proceeds to go play hockey on my last day. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? I stated my boundaries, he didn\u2019t respect them and in turn was spiteful regarding our time together",

I decided since they were having a small group gather there then going to the rally together, I would send some treats for the group from a great bakery here.

Obviously, the driver did not wait. Wondering why I had not heard, I asked my friend if they had received it. Negative.\n\nTheir concierge took a photo of the delivery before placing it in the mailroom for any random tenants to enjoy. Better than wasting it, I guess.\n\nThe photo I was shown was taken from the side. Not until my friends investigated did they find the concierge had snapped a photo before sharing the \"misdelivered\" items. \n\nThe package had MY NAME on top. Not either of the recipients' names. Not their unit number. My name.\n\nNow the bakery is offering a gift card to me for half the price I paid.   \nI wanted to be there with my friends, could not.  \nI wanted to support them and their group with treats.  \nI arranged and paid for the item, my receipt clearly shows their names and address as recipients.  \nI cannot go back in time and give them the sweet support.\n\nI am pretty ticked off. The mistake was on the bakery or possibly the delivery co they chose. NOT me. I am shocked they would offer me a gc for 50% of what I paid. (We're in Boston, shit ain't cheap.) \n\nAITA?",

            "body": "AITAH for unfriending a girl who talked shit behind my back?\n\nSo I (15F) have been friends with this girl, let\u2019s call her Charlotte, for around 2-3 years. We are in the same school with my bf as well, who\u2019s friends w charlotte too. So when me and my bf started dating, we had a friend group with charlotte. She has always treated me well and promised that she would never talk shit behind my back like the others. \n\nFast forward to the start of grade 10, me and my bf started to have some arguments as he was jealous of me talking to a guy classmate. He went to charlotte for comfort and advice which i didn\u2019t know it was happening for a few days already. Until he wanted to break up with me. At last, he decided not to but then she was mad at him for not breaking up with me. I know I shouldn\u2019t have looked at their conversation/texts but i was curious on what did they talk behind my back. I found that she mimicked on how i talk to my bf, like \u201c \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb\u201d (when people use this to mimic people, it means calling them fake) i forgot the rest as it happened a few months back. But I felt betrayed as i never would\u2019ve expected that from her.\n\nSo i unfriended her as I didn\u2019t want any toxic relationship around me. She then posted a thread about me saying the events that happened, some sentences being like \u201cI felt super helpless and annoyed that she unfriended me after\u201d \u201cthe most thing that made me mad is that her bf allowed her to see the chat, it made me feel like i didn\u2019t have privacy at all\u201d \u201cAll i did was gave advice and now u don\u2019t want me\u201d \u201call i wanted was to help u guys\u201d. But honestly she read all of the screenshots my bf sent to her including the texts i sent to the guy classmate (I see him as a friend tho i only knew him for a few days), there was no privacy anywhere whatsoever for me as well.\n\nIdk if i am the asshole for this, but honestly I felt as helpless as she did, perhaps more disappointed than her as well. Seeing that she excluded some parts in her contexts makes me want to speak out for myself in threads as well, but i fear that she will see it and start a new drama like how she did previously for a couple times during our friendship. Am i the wrong here tho?",

My husband( 38) snd me (35) met 15 years ago through mutual contact. After meeting we got engaged and married after 4 years. Basically it is an arranged marriage. At the time i met him i was around 20 years old and still figuring out my life but due to personal affairs of my family i had to agree for marriage. At that time my husband was loving,caring albit sometimes very narrow minded and strict which i did not like (at that time we were having a long distance relationship) and we had argivements about it but in the end i m the one who waved the white flag always.  When we got married his behaviour changed a bit to the worse but i stil did not say anything cz i didnt want any fights between us. I love him that much.So he basically put me down again and again.  I took care of everything. The home, laundry cooking cleaning the kids, school runs etc. and even him. He did not lift a finger. I had help until few years back but now i am doing all alone. He was financially stable had opened his own company and everything was fine until the company had to be shutdown. His own fault cz he was trusting his closest friends a lot and basically handed over everything to them until he realized they are sucking him dry.also i might add he got caught cheating too which i forgave him but warned him i will not forget and will leave his sorry ass if he did it again. Now after 10 years and 3 little girls his behaviour got more towards the worse. as now he doesnt respect me at all, blames me for everything does not share or communicate anything with me even when i ask something he just keeps repeating i will take care of my life you dont have to involve in it. Basically when he sees me he just gets angry and treat me as a stranger. Also he is not a good father figure to our girls too. Yells at them when they cry does not attend school events unless compulsory. From few days he is not even talking to me cz his morning tea was late and he  madeit himself. I am financially depend on him since i am not working and with everything going on i dont have much time during the day to work. I try looking into online work but so far i dont have much luck. What shall i do? I have a mind to give up everything but like i said i m depend on him even my parents. I m just too tired of everything and too depressed.",

Thank you!\n\n  \nBackground\n\nI (m21) have been with my girlfriend (f31) for off and on 3 years now. We are pretty strong as a couple, but recently there is an issue that we just can't seem to agree on.\n\nFor context, we do not live together, but my girlfriend lives in the same apartment complex that I do, just in a different building, and is over most nights\n\n  \nI am a person who sometimes has a hard time separating frustration from work, the drive (crazy drivers are where I'm at, I drive between 30 minutes to an hour each way on the highway) and home. Now, this isn't always an issue, I'd say it gets bad maybe once a month or maybe twice, where work and the drive sucked so badly that I either need a night to myself or if my girlfriend wants to come over, I give her a warning I may not be pleasant company, as a courtesy. This happened yesterday, as I was run off the road by someone on their phone on my way to work, then had to deal with that one co worker that everyone has that no one likes lol. \n\n  \nSo needless to say, I was pretty tight around 4pm and I still had 3 hours left in my shift. I shoot my gf a text and let her know that today is a day where I'm pretty heated and I'd understand if she doesn't want to hangout. She said she understood, and thanked me for informing her.\n\n  \nWe call while I'm on the way home as we usually do and we talk some about what got me heated and we are doing decently. I'm not expressly mad, just mostly tired and a tad short at this point. She said she still wanted to come over, which I was fine with, as I had already warned her and she has been around while I've been like this before and it is usually fine. I hang up when I get home so I can cook myself dinner, we usually do food separate (usually in the same house though) as we have very different pallets. I am cooking, and the usual window for when she would come over has gone past 30 minutes. I text her to make sure she's okay and after not receiving a response for around 15 minutes ish, I call her. (this wasn't me trying to be a way, I just wanted to know if she was coming over so I would know if i should stay up for her. I go into work pretty early.)\n\n  \nShe answers, and we get to talking. Things are fine on her end, but she says she doesn't really feel like leaving her house. I say that I completely understand, especially considering the circumstances. No hard feelings on my end, but I notice as we still talk for a few moments that she is withdrawn.  I ask what's going on, and eventually she tells me that she's sad I didn't say I wanted her over when she said she didn't want to come over. I respond that she gave very valid reasons as to why she didn't want to leave her house, that alone is enough for me to not press about her coming over. She gave me a reason and I wasn't going to be selfish and push through. I told her that, and I was told again that she didn't understand. I expressed again that she gave me a perfectly valid reason with not wanting to leave and that I respect her autonomy and didn't want to pressure or push, because she clearly has a good reason to stay home.\n\n  \nThis caused a minor disagreement where we went somewhat back and forth, without raising our voices or anything, but it got somewhat heated. I still think I did nothing wrong, and especially given the mental space I was in, I was not wrong for how I handled it. Am I wrong? \n\n  \nFor context, I only am this concerned about it because she has a bad habit of turning things like this into full blown issues later, so when I see a problem, I would like to at least hear her side and know where she is coming from so we can both be heard by the other person and know that we see each other. I only explained myself as persistently as I did, as it seemed like she was trying to get why it seemed like I didn't want to see her.\n\nAnother piece of context, I do not go to her apartment. She is a tad bit anal about her house, which I am not as. It is completely fine that we have different boundaries, but I do not think I could handle how she usually gets about her house when I am already upset.",

They said \"Because the matter was resolved, it didn't matter anymore.\" I said that just because the argument was years ago, doesn't mean it was \"resolved;\" I'm sure my ex still thinks the same way, and I still think he's an idiot for it. \n\nAfter some back and forth, I (pettily) made a post about whether IWTA for arguing the point with the mods. The bot flagged it and stated it would be better posted in the forum (I didn't realize there even was a forum at this point), so I deleted the post and instead posted in the forum, asking if the rest of the public felt that the timeline of when an argument occurs has any bearing on whether someone is an asshole or not, and I said \"If I changed the timeline in my post and pretended it happened last week, how the heck would you know, and why would it even matter?\" \n\nThen, I posted a third post that followed all of their rules to a T. The moderators flagged it as \"Diary posting\" and as breaking Rule 7: not being recent. (Even though it had just happened a week and a half ago.) I stated as much, and said I'm not sure how it's a diary post, as this should be my first approved post on the sub. They stated that because I'd attempted 2 other posts that day, that I'm now not allowed to post until November (which is fucking ridiculous in my mind). They also said that because I \"Worded when the post happened rather ambiguously,\" they were assuming I was breaking the rules. (I'd stated the event occurred during my country's \"Birthday\"; that being Canada Day on July 1st.) And said that I was being petulant about the rules. \n\nNone of my posts (minus the second, which I deleted), was technically against the rules. Rule 7 states that the post \"Should\" be recent, not that it must be, and otherwise the subreddit encourages people to use throw away accounts and to share their stories... so... yeah. I'm pretty sure the mods are just on a fricken power trip on there, and being picky over stupid shit.",

I live in Montana and I was helping them out by giving them a place to rest while they try to save up some money to get their own place. Over the course of a full month, from July 2, 2024 to August 2, 2024, the two would argue nearly every single day, whether at work or inside my apartment during the sound ordinance. As I'm living in an apartment, that causes me a lot of issues and worry since that could potentially get me kicked out of my apartment at worse, ruining my hard work of owning the apartment for 2 months at the time. Due to my rough upbringing in life, I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE arguments in the household, which was ruining my already messed up sleep schedule even more. I would consider myself a very patient guy, but hearing them argue the entire time and waking up to it really pissed me off, but I managed to control myself and went to get something to drink. As I returned to my bedroom, I slammed my door because I was pissed, and that's how I was letting them know I was pissed. Apparently, I can't slam my own door because the male, calling him Asshole, decides to open my bedroom door and say these exact words: \"What the fuck is your problem?!\" I stared at him for a moment before yelling and going off on him about how they were interrupting my sleep with their arguments and acting like children, they're at least 5-15 years older than I am, and he decides to try to push me back. I then forced him back, me holding him by the throat, and slammed him against my wall on the other side of my apartment. I then yelled at both of them to pack their crap and get the fuck out of my apartment. I then went over to one of my neighbors, who's also like family and calling him Awesome bro and white, and explained to him what happened while pacing angrily in his apartment. After a bit, I asked Awesome bro to join me in going back to my apartment to ensure Asshole doesn't do anything to my apartment, and upon returning to my apartment I see the police standing outside my apartment as well as my landlord. It had me even more pissed and angry as well as worried that I'm losing my apartment, but my landlord assured me I wasn't in any trouble and I'm good. I explained everything to an officer to the best of my ability while still very angry, though the officer was quite understanding. Once they we're all gone, I was finally able to fall asleep peacefully, and this all happened at 3 am. I'm very new to the app",

I was kind of surprised because I didn't even know she was dating anyone. Introvert Me was sort of annoyed. It's a 3 1/2 week trip and I have never met this person. I have been on many trips with her many boyfriends she has had in the past but at least I had met them a few times before going on a trip with them. They have only been going out for about 2 months now.  I wish I would have at least had the chance to at least re-book some stuff so I can just branch off and do my own thing if I feel like my social battery is overloaded but my Mom is upset to hear that I want to separate. Also majority of the bookings are under my name. My Sister (37) and I (38) are very opposite. She is an extreme extrovert and loves to mingle with strangers. I just feel like meeting a stranger and being with them almost 24/7 for 4 weeks on a vacation is not my thing. I feel like I am the AH because her 3 kids (aged 7-17yrs) and my parents don't care if her boyfriend comes, it's just me. They had the chance to meet him twice now. I asked my Mom what she thought of him and she said they had very little interaction, so she doesn't really know. My Parents always lets my Sister do whatever she wants cause she is the baby of the family (but that is even a longer back story). Everyone is pressuring me and now I don't feel excited about this trip.... \n\nSo AITAH?",

How do you get a 73 year old stubborn man to stop eating your child's food and sweets and even your own food, especially when he gets more than his fair share and eats way more than anyone in this household? I'm allergic to eggs and gluten. My diet is limited and he has the audacity to eat even my special foods that is all I can eat without an allergic reaction. Talking hasn't worked, asking hasn't worked. I have even set one drawerbin the fridge just fir our stuff, told him it's our stuff. If we put our left overs in the fridge to eat later that day or the next day, he will literally go and eat it out of our dishes in the fridge and just leave the empty dish inside. He is a glutton. He will finish 4 loafs of bread on his own in 2 days. 1 2ltr tub of ice cream in 20 minutes on his own, 1 kg stork margerine in a week. 1 kg syrup in a week. 750g ricoffy in 2 weeks, 2 kg sygar in 1 week all on his own, 1 pocket of potatoes in less than 2 weeks etc on his own! I am at my witts end. I can't even afford a second hand fridge to keep in my room just so he can leave our stuff alone. We eat once a day. Sometimes we even have just popcorn for dinner while he eats eggs, bread, tomatoes etc multiple times a day. When his 4 loafs of bread was finished, he stole my Rye bread and ate it. I am constantly stressed that he is going to eat my child's food. I am truly disgusted at his behavior and gluttony. We try our best to stretch meals and make everything last, while he just goes crazy finishing everything off like A stray dog that hasn't fed in months.he will finish all of his and then take ours as well. The last 2 weeks of the month there is no money and no food left. Food and money lasts only 2 weeks in this house because of him. I can't anymore and moving isn't an option right now because we have to constantly take care of him and I take care of all his medical needs etc. I can't anymore. Taking a child's food and sweets is disgusting and shameful!",

We live in Florida, and Abortion (a topic known in our home to be very important to me) was on the ballot. Back story, last year I found out I was pregnant and did not want to be. Living in Florida I had very limited access to help and ultimately chose to order medication online from a completely different country. Not ideal at all especially being that I am a nurse I knew it was risky but I felt like I had no other options, I couldn\u2019t travel and was running out of time. Unfortunately, the medication was not completely effective and I suffered life-threatening complications in the days following. While dealing with these complications my husband was gone for a few days due to a stateside temporary deployment. Thankfully My best friend was able to take me in for emergency surgery as he was not able to come home (which was understandable but heartbreaking\u2026military spouse life in a nutshell). However, following all of this when he did come home he never checked in with me. Never asked how I was doing (pro-choice doesn\u2019t mean emotionless btw). Fast forward, a year has gone by and we are in November 2024. It\u2019s Election Day. I ask if he has gone to vote. He says \u201cno\u201d and that he would not be doing so because \u201cit isn\u2019t that important.\u201d We have always had differing political opinions but have managed to work through them in the past, however, we do agree on being pro-choice. That being said, I asked if he would at least go vote on just the abortion ban given all that we (really, I) had been through (he never really acknowledged that it even happened). He again said no. \nElection Day comes and goes and we get the results that 57% of Floridians voted pro-choice and only 3% more was needed to amend the law to allow women abortion healthcare. I found this incredibly frustrating. That evening I heard my husband and a friend of ours agreeing that they did not see the point of voting, mind you I am friends with this other man\u2019s wife as well who has gone through a very similar situation. We (his wife and I) are upset at this point and I make my opinion known to them at this point. They tell me to stop talking politics and to drop it. \nI take a few days to process and ultimately try to have a vulnerable conversation with my husband. It does not go well. The biggest point of contention is that I asked my husband (a black male) if he cannot see the comparison that other people before him have had to fight for the rights that he enjoys today, or hell for us to even be married (I am a white female). He tells me that \u201cfighting for black people\u2019s rights is long in the past\u201d, and that civil rights are not a current issue. He also says that I am completely unqualified to be asking this question or comparing women\u2019s rights to the rights of people of color. \nA few days go by and we try to have the conversation again but it just turns into a heated argument. After which we both agree to file for divorce. \nSo, am I the asshole for wanting a divorce from my husband who says he is pro-choice but thinks that voting is a waste of time and means nothing? Even when your partner who has had a terrible personal experience is telling you that it is so important to them? \n\nLet me know.",

I'm guessing you also wanted Harris-Walz to win. If he was pulling Trump (I'm white living in a mixed neighborhood) like most black folk I know, his vote would have upset you. So he just doesn't vote. If this is the case and he voted for Trump would you still have bad feelings or would you have supported the pro choice he made if he did vote that way?\u00a0",

            "body": "AITAH for wanting to leave my homophobic friend with autism. (Sorry for how long it is there is a lot on my mind)\n\nLast night over call we were talking about his views on the LGBTQIA+ community bc a few months ago he told me he thought it was not normal. I wanted to see if I could change his perspective since I'm gay myself. I asked him and he said he felt gay dating/marriage shouldn't even be happening. I told him he should educate himself, and he got upset and told me to educate him instead. I asked him what if he had a friend who was gay and he said he'd fake being supportive and would be uncomfortable by his friend but if it was his best friend he'd be less uncomfortable. Throughout the whole conversation, he showed signs of irritation and uncomfortability and even said one time he wanted to get the conversation over with bc we were wasting time.\n\nI then came out to him and before I could go into how his views affected me, he told me he had feelings for me and he didn't care about my sexuality. I told him I didn't like guys like that and that I saw him as a brother. He was bummed and said it hit him hard, and I tried to comfort him. After our convo, the time was close to 9:30 and we had talked since 6:41 so I told him we should get off for the night so that he could rest from everything, he said he was fine and wanted to keep talking, asking me if we were still friends, showing signs of intense stress. I said It was already so late and that it was best if he just headed to sleep to which he started to melt down. Eventually, I was able to convince him to just get off the call and rest and he said he just wanted to forget the whole conversation, even making me promise to talk to him this weekend, to which I did bc I didn't want him to hurt himself again.\n\nI'm pissed he turned the conversation onto himself instead of acknowledging that me being gay means his views are hurtful to me, it felt unnecessary and unfair. It also hurts bc he's the type of guy who wants full support for everything he does but he clearly won't change and be supportive for something as normal as me finding a partner. It also upsets me that he doesn't want to educate himself on his own time bc I've always made sure to do that with him and his autism. For example, he's very insistent when he wants something, and he will not drop it until he gets what he wants. I have a sister who he wants to be friends with. When she told him she sees him as my friend. He has been constantly asking for her to talk and hang out with him to try and get to know her better, even asking me for her number, to which I said no bc she said not to give it to him, only for him to ask again a few months later. We've tried to get him to stop but he just won't. Another thing is one time he told me a secret that disturbed me and when taking space wasn't an option (he kept messaging me every weekend asking if I was ready to talk to him again for two weeks) I decided to educate myself and learned to accept his secret bc he couldn't control it.\n\nAnyway, I don't know if I'm being overdramatic or not, I have no one to talk to about this, my family can't know bc I don't want to tell them i'm gay and I have no friends to talk about this too. I don't know how to confront him about it either bc I know he's gonna beg me to stay (it's happened before) and I know I'll cave in but I don't want to ghost him bc that's not right, I'd feel horrible bc I know he'd freak out. Am I the AH?",

I recently started working in the wonderful world of marketing and sales. I had just started out at this company, began learning their product, and how to generate sales. I was so into the job that I even started learning Spanish to maximize my areas of expertise. While working with this company, I pretty much put all I could into it to make sure I gained inspiration from the experience.\n\nRecently, I was pitching for one of their locations. Since I\u2019m new, I didn\u2019t have a badge generated yet, and this caused alarm with the associates at the store. They asked who I was and for verification of my identity. I let them know my name, why I didn\u2019t have a badge, and that my manager could verify my information. When my manager arrived, I went back to my booth and was then told the situation had been handled.\n\nLater that night, my employer called to inform me that the store had sent a complaint to my company\u2019s contractor for \u201cemployee rude behavior.\u201d But none of my actions were rude. When I reached out to the store, they said they made no such complaint. I was a bit in disbelief, but they were able to provide me with information supporting that claim.\n\nThe next day, I received a text saying I wouldn\u2019t be able to come back to work. I stated my side and asked if there was any way to fight the claim because it was a lie. They told me there was nothing anyone could do. I also asked to see documentation of the complaint filed or the correspondence, to which they denied.\n\nNow, thinking about it more clearly, I feel like my acting manager may have been the one who filed the complaint, due to the lack of information they are willing to provide and claims from other employees. Any advice? I don\u2019t want to lie down and take this treatment. So AITAH ?",

He is my first love and my first real boyfriend. He\u2019s the most caring human I have ever met and has faught for us as long as we had been together. Here\u2019s the issue. We both had went to college, but over winter break he found out he can\u2019t afford another semester. His family had decided to have him drop out and move into something more blue collar.  He is to get a license and a job so we actually have a chance of staying together and so far in the time he has known he is staying home, (2 weeks) he has done nothing but play video games. This boy has some mental issues that I am aware of. He\u2019s sensitive, suicidal at times, and feels little worth in himself. He\u2019s SO much better and happier with me, but without me he gives up. He fights for me when I\u2019m there, but since we\u2019ve spent a whole month virtual he is loosing himself completely. He had told me he wants us, he wants a future, he wants to fight for us, but he has yet to apply for a job, practice driving, or even look at future careers. He simply gives up and goes into a state of depression. His parents call him a failure that can\u2019t amount to anything and instead of feeling the will to prove them wrong, he believes them and accept defeat. His self worth is plummeted to the point of bringing up breaking up so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with him. He told me tonight he was scared about us making it. I went off on him and I told him I understand he is scared but if he isn\u2019t going to put any effort into us, then I don\u2019t want to hear it. I am scared, I am fighting my parents to try and drive two hours to spend a day with him, I\u2019m searching careers he\u2019d be good at and sending it to him. He\u2019s scared and giving up on us. I was raised to fight. He was raised to give up. Yesterday he told me that once the college had officially removed him from the school then he would apply. The college did that today and he had done nothing. I told him tomorrow morning wake up, call ups and ask how to get an application (he wants to work there), and look at a few practice tests online. That\u2019s all he needs to do and the rest will start to come. He told me okay, but it wasn\u2019t the first okay I\u2019ve heard. How do I go about all of this? Is this worth staying or manipulation?",

Slapped/scratched a guy who groped my behind in the checkout lane at the supermarket.  Publicly shamed & verbally abused by most of the people around me because it turned out the guy had Downs Syndrome. \n\nSo I was in line to check out at the supermarket today & the guy behind me crowded me then groped my backside with both hands & made groaning noises/smacked his lips. I couldn't help it. Didn't think about it, didn't have time, but my automatic reaction was fear and fury & I just spun around & slap/ scratched the guy. He stumbled back & started screaming. I was terrified, disgusted & felt totally violated. I still do.\n\nHe was with someone who also started yelling... at me. Telling me off for what I did & how could I? Can't I see he has downs & he didn't mean anything by it. \nOthers started abusing me too & some others who weren't vocal about it were shaking their heads & frowning at me.. like IM in the wrong. \nI know it's not acceptable or legal to touch another without their consent. \nMy issue is, shouldn't this apply to everyone, regardless of their age or mental capacity, disability, level of cognitive function? \nI'm not here for a PC lecture on downs or woke opinions.\nSorry to be frank, I know that sounds harsh.\n\nI feel this cannot have been the first time this individual has expressed this kind of behaviour. Surely there were signs that those around him, especially those caring for & supporting him, should have picked up on. Even if they didn't, shouldn't consent & appropriate social behaviour be part of any individuals education? \nIf someone is going to be out in society, then shouldn't we be able to expect normal socially accepted boundaries to be respected? \nYes some people are just a-holes, but if its a person who is known to have difficulty learning these very important facts, shouldn't EXTRA effort have been put in to educate the person?\nIf someone isn't able to function in society & adhere to these boundaries, should they be out in society? Especially with someone like a carer or responsible adult?\nShould I have to put up with this kind of behaviour just because the abuser has a deficit of some kind?\nGiven the response of the person they were with, I feel this hasn't & probably won't be the last time they allow/support/defend these actions. \nI feel totally violated. \n\nThis is not PC at all. So. Read if u want to. \nBut this is not my first encounter with sexual  harassment & a person with downs syndrome. I worked in a care home for years where this was common, however it was dealt with strictly, and appropriately. It certainly wasn't forgiven & defended. \nIt seems to me, in my own experience, that most people with downs syndrome (even though everyone is an individual & different etc etc), are hypersexual, lack restraint & are SUPER touchy/handsy.\nI don't like to make generalisations,  but now I will be on guard around anyone with downs syndrome & keep my distance as I am afraid of this happening again & how i can deal with it.\nAITA for feeling this way or for how i reacted? Should I feel differently or have reacted differently just because this individual had down syndrome?",

Yesterday when I was bathing she tried to enter but the lock was on, she got upset, and told her I said I was doing what she asked me to do, I'm lost, reditt women, so I'm the bad guy",

So Mike and Jenny are dating for around a year now, while I know him for around two years. I only saw her a couple of times, and she was always a picme around anyone, even other guys. One night I was chilling with him, and others, when he started talking about how he and his gf don't have any intimacy. He then proceeded to asked me if I'd want to hook up with him. I was drunk and high (so was he) and I stupidly agreed on it, even making a whole ass deal, swearing to me that Jenny would be fine with it, because they talked about it and she didn't mind, also due to their relationship being quite toxic and about to end, also because Jenny found interest in other guys. The next morning I went to him, we had intimacy, and that was about it. The whole drama started when I, again drunk, told my friend about it, who then told me that Mike tried to hook up with this friend as well. This friend felt so bad for Jenny, that we ended up texting her all about it. Mike was able to read those messages and was now pissed at me and my friend. Forward three days, some more people now about it and hating on Mike for cheating on Jenny, while he tries to blame me for all of it. I understand that I messed up too, but I'm not the one who's cheating on my partner.\nReddit AITAH??",

He wasn't supportive financially or emotionally, never showed up for any graduations, college visits, or any other milestone events in my life including the building of my very own off-grid home, something he could've helped with being that he is a master plumber, I cut him off 7 years ago and felt better off. Two weeks ago I got a message from family members that he had been diagnosed with congenital heart failure and I immediately sprang into daughter mode. it turns out however, that the situation is beyond dire. he also has type 2 diabetes and risks losing his lower limbs due to him avoiding doctors and medical care. The list of ailments is loooooong, he needs housing and full-time care. When I asked him what his options are he said to me on the phone \"well I can't just come live with you.\" WTAF. I mentioned my home is off-grid, no running water, no flushing toilet, and I've been living this way for the last 5 years sacrificing modern means to save money and build my home without a huge debt pile. I bought my own plot of land, saved money, built the house by myself and never lived beyond my means, something he has never even considered, blowing money left and right and never thinking ahead or securing a savings account. Bottom line, he can't live with me, it's not set up for home care of an elderly person nor do I have -dare I say it- the desire to help someone who's never helped me. No one else in the family can take him and my younger brother doesn't want anything to do with him so the burden I'm being told solely falls on me. I tried calling DOZENS of emergency care resources and state-funded housing none of which are available right away and he needs to be out of his current housing situation in a few days leaving me to figure out where to send him within that time. He left everything to the last minute and caused a mountain of stress on my shoulders. His gf of 10 years says she is \"done\" and cant be much help cause they arent married and she needs a relative to take the lead. This whole situation has made me angry, bitter, resentful and also guilty. How is it that guy who never helped me is now the one I have to help. AMITAH?",

            "body": "AITA \"I wouldn't have cared if they died.\"\n\nI am a 22YO F who is friends? with 35 yr old f Patricia. Despite our age gap. Me being mature and her being immature, we've been good friends for over a year. I would always describe her as funny, and kind but I've started to see selfish, like stupid selfish. Major red flags. \n\nThese events happen one day after another for 3 days.\n\nFirst day: a hurricane was going to hit that night and her family chat had been going off all night. It was her mother saying she's scared. I offered plenty of times to pick her up and have her stay in the hotel room we'd gotten. To which she replied, \"Nah. She'll be ok.\" Even though she had been saying she felt bad for her. ( The next morning, 3 major trees had fallen on her mom's property, luckily none near the house. (\n\nSecond day: after begging the manager at the hotel for more time, even one more day, he caved. We had a co worker struggling to get a room and half her house and porch was absolutely destroyed from a massive tree. Patricia refused to give her the room because she couldn't live without a.c. \n\nThird day: I had been texting Patricia all night 8-9ish p.m. - 4 a.m. that me and my husband received word from his cousins wife that my husband's aunt and uncle had been in a serious accident. Direct hit on a busy highway. Had to be cut out of cars. No one knew if they even survived. She was hysterical. We also found out she was pregnant. Mind you, she has a baby and an older child already. \n\nPatricia worked that morning and had to be awake at 4 and was going to a concert that day but didn't message for almost 24 hrs or over. I could see that she was active on Instagram constantly so I couldn't understand why she wouldn't respond. When she did respond, it was, \"Sorry. You can call me.\" Then an hour or two layer, \"My name!!!!\" Like she was frustrated I didn't immediately call her. I eventually replied, \"K\" hours later. \n\nI chose to forgive her because I should be silly to believe she would care a lot given the last couple days and that I would only talk about it if she brought it up. \n\nThe next time we worked, a couple days later, we started great, everything was normal besides her jabbing that, \"I was upset because she ghosted me.\" A co worker told her that the day after but i had to simply explain to him so he could come in since I wasn't coming in. \n\nAt the end of the day, it was just us and she brought it up. It was hard to stay cool calm and professionalism for the whole conversation at work because she immediately blew up when I stated honestly that it would have been very hard to forgive her if they died. She said things like, \"I can't believe you wouldn't forgive me? What did you want me to do? I was stressing, no lights, had to get ready for concert. Did you want me to go to your house? Do you want me to get on my knees? I didn't even know them. They're not even your family and they're not closely related to your husbands family. I'm SoRrY I wouldn't care if they died.\" A lot of throwing hands and dramatic sarcasam.\n\nEverytime I'd try to correct or get her to understand, the same phrases would repeat, even when I asked what she would have done if it was her aunt and uncle, to which she said, \"I would still have gone into work if they'd died and be a little sad.\" \n\nWhich makes me believe, she's mad I didn't go into work and that slivered any shred of empathy she might have had. \n\nI said we should stop the conversation cause it wasn't going anywhere and she said I thought she was heartless and I said yeah. \n\nShe kept jabbing me and even jabbed about how I was cleaning up and saying, \"if you want to get away, just leave.\" I didn't speak hardly at all and busted my ass to slip away and clock out. \n\nShe proceeds to call and text when I'm on my way home cause I guess she assumed we were still hanging out after work. \n\nI have not said anything else to her and am not sure what to do especially since we work together and I don't know if this is anything she will actually feel bad about or work on. \n\nPlease. Any Similar situation? Make it make sense.\n\nI'm especially hurt since I had bonded with her about my aunt passing in the beginning of the relationship and feel like she wasn't even listening or present through my heartbreak looking back at it after this.\n\nAlso, if I had responded remotely similar to her constantly talking about her hurt over someone she recently lost, I don't think she would take to it kindly. I don't understand how she can't understand other people hurting. \n\nOr am I the asshole and being sensitive like she says? Am I overthinking? Blowing it out of proportion? \n\nAll I wanted and needed was a genuine friend with genuine care.",

            "body": "For context, I met this guy on Tinder. After a few exchanges for 1-2 days, we showed that we are interested in each other. He always check on me, do some flirting on me and said something along the line of \"you are important to me\", \"you are precious to me\" or something like that and mind you, we barely know anything about each other. He never ask me about what I'm interested in, what my dream job is, what my perspectives in life, he just said that I'm friendly, funny, mature and would want to have a relationship with me. Things are moving too fast so I am being skeptical, yet I feel flattered so we just keep talking.  \n  \nAnd then, this guy is just very passionate about stock trading, and he tried to persuade me to do so, as in an activity to bond as a couple and also earn more money to travel. I showed no interest in that, so he said that he will guarantee I'll make money and pay me back if I lost any money, and I can join with a minimum of 100$ (this is the website that he showed me by the way: mctadd////something dot com). I said no at first. And then, after he insisted many more time, I said I will trust him with a little more time and I will decide to trust him or not after I saw him in person. After that, he got mad, and said that he don't like my mindset for how unwilling I am to be brave and trying new things, that we will not compatible in life, and we shouldn't talk to each other anymore because he doesn't want to talk to someone that doesn't trust him.  \n  \nAm I the asshole here, because isn't everything moving too fast? As I said we literally just talked online for 5 days, and the guy doesn't even know what I like to eat. And I don't like being pushed doing sometimes that I never try, and stocking trading seems risky to me, especially when I am struggling fianicially. Please let me no, because I'm so confused and my post getting deleted for whatever reason.",

I haven't heard from her in 20+ years except the phone call 2 years ago to come clean their mess up. She hasn't asked about any of my children in 20 years until recently. I don't feel like I owe her anything. I forgave her for my own heart to heal, but that doesn't mean I want her in my life or in my home. If she hadn't kicked my brother out would she have even called me? She also told me she was on birth control when she got pregnant with me. Obviously she didn't want me. I don't believe she would have called me if she hadn't kicked my brother out. So, is she just trying to use me? I don't want to disrupt my life for someone that didn't care about me at all until now.

            "body": "AITAH for wanting to take myself out of this cycle?\n\nthis is complex so bear with me. I am a 26 yr old female, oldest daughter. I live in a house with my single mom, two younger brothers (15, 12), two younger sisters (19, 24) and my sisters boyfriend! to put it bluntly no one cleans up after themselves, and it only seems to get done on days where everyone works together but on a daily basis, im pretty much the only one who does it and it takes hours. On top of this, I am in full time university. drowning in school ,law school to be exact. I still will find time to clean up messes that aren't mine, it takes hours. My mother also is out a lot during the day busy running around my siblings, and I know she doesn't have a lot of time as she should, but to be frank, she's also lazy.. my 19 year old sister will \\*sometimes\\* come down and pick up garbage, but leave an entire sink full of dishes, so its a light tidy that really doesn't help much.. a little bit more background: my mom hates me. I am treated way differently than all my siblings. every time she speaks to me it's abusive, rude, name calling, calling me fat, just horrible verbal abuse. I live with it and just try to get through. Despite this, I still help clean. and when I clean, it's hours at a time cleaning PROPERLY. My youngest sister and my mom are the best of friends and she couldn't ever do any wrong, and my brothers are never expected to help, although they are very misbehaved and stress my mom out immensely. \n\nFor some reason, my mom has this narrative where she tells everyone I do the LEAST in this house!! which (im not even kidding or exaggerating) is DELUSIONAL! I do the MOST! by FAR! more than her!!!! I am the only one who cooks (I cook for nine people at a time.. if you cook you know how much work that is), I constantly clean spotless and tirelessly. And it is NEVER recognized. ever! our friends and family are honest to god convinced I am a lazy bum who doesn't help her which is just mind-blowing to me. however my siblings do say different and wills tick up for me( not the 19 year old though). \n\ntonight they all decided to clean. A week ago, I was on a trip for five days. I cleaned the house before I left, it was spotless, I came home to what I would consider hoarders. it was bad. Nonetheless, I woke up the next day ( my fist day home) and spent seven hours on the main level. it was spotless. I also knew that I was about to go into my last two weeks of the semester, and it would be crazy! (6 tests, 17 assignments, 3 evaluations). So this was my contribution to the house cleaning ( we have floor guys coming in and it needs to be spotless.) I did my part! NOBODY kept up with it. Fast forward to today they are all scrambling. I got home at 5 pm from school, and said I have a quiz online however after that... I will help. I have two assignments due tonight at midnight, as well as two tests tomorrow! but I was going to put this aside as I always do. My mom decided to abuse me the entire time, scream that I don't help, get on the phone and ie to family members that was refusing to help, etc. So....I said screw this, and I went in my room, opened my laptop and decided not to sacrifice my school! I am now sticking firm to boundaries that I will no longer clean. I will clean after me myself and I, and thats IT! does that make me the asshole? I liven a cycle of abuse and cant see when im in the right anymore!   \nI figue.. why continuously tire myself out to just be told I don't help anyways, and why exhaust myself for people who don't like me, tell me they don't like me, and treat me like crap? Why continue to clean for someone who allows her youngest children to constantly mess it up? it doesn't make sense!! unsure of what to do int this situation, I help and am told I don't help and im horrible, but then I do help, exhaust myself and the result is still the same!!",

Fast forward to last year, both of us applied cabin crew and we managed to go on the last stages of the interview. Unfortunately, I got rejected and received a news that she's got accepted as a cabin crew. The next day my closed friend shared to me the news that she got accepted and keep on texting me how happy she was. I said congrats and said that I am happy for her but at the same time deep down I felt very overwhelmed and sad as she keeps on texting about it, so later that night I decided to blocked her to avoid the conversation getting too long, that's the only reason. Then a week later I unblocked her but only to realized that she been blocking me as well. I did confront to her why I blocked her during that time and she's not responding until now. \n\n  \nSo AITAH for blocking her due to feeling overwhelmed?",

Honestly, even before they got married, it seemed to me it wouldn\u00b4t work between them, but who was I to say. They have 3 childern together and she\u00b4s now doing her best to enstrange the kids from their dad. At first I felt sorry for her, but the longer this goes on, and the more I heard both sides, the more I realise that my brother is in for a whole lot of drama and sorrow. I honestly feel sorry of the childern the most. This woman claims to love her childern SO MUCH, but all she does is spoil them with candy or shouts at them like a banshee. She is clueless on how to teach a child basic orderliness, or some level of diseplin. For example: \"first we do our homework and then we play computer games.\" My nephews\u00b4 school grades look terrible. One of them failed a grade. She never cleans the apartment, that my brother pays for. She expects her kids to do this. I cannot begin to tell you how absolutly filthy that place is. Its like something you see in some extreme reality TV show about poor people. Furthermore she barely gives the kids a healthy meal, they have to try to cook on their own, somedays. Its a hazard waiting to happen. She leaves them alone at home to go party and comes home drunk at 4am. She lets them bath in cold water in winter because she wants to safe on electricity, all this while my brother pays her for the kids and the house and she works a fulltime job. She lately bought a big-ass flatscreen TV, which she hid form my parents. They found out about it, because the little one wanted to show granny something on the TV, which is in his mom\u00b4s room. She discovered about this and banned my parents from her apartment. She also doesn\u00b4t teach the kids about saving some money. You know, the normal things you learn, growing up in a healthy home. She told them all horrible stuff about my brother, but of course not about the horrible stuff she did to my brother. For example how she assaulted him, scratching him, trying to scratch his eyes out, in the prosess ripping his T-shirt off his body. All the while he tried to proteced his face, knowing if he hits back, he will go to jail. While she was assaulting him, she shouted \"he\u00b4s beating me!\" while the kids were in the next room. At some point she wanted to beat him with the rolling pin (kid you not). My dad had happend to be in the visinity and he heard the comotion and as he turned the corner he saw her and grabbed her arm right before she hit my brother over the head. He never told the kids this, even though they saw the bruises and asked what happend.\n\nShe tries to portrait my brother as the absent father who does\u00b4t care about his childern, but in the meantime she doesn\u00b4t answer the phone when he calls at a reasonable time to talk to the children, even on their birthdays she tries to make it look like he doesn\u00b4t care. She told him, if he wants to spend time with them, he should make an appointment via her attorney. She didn\u00b4t tell him about his kid that failed a year. After various requests from my brother to see their marks, she send him pictures of the raports of the two kids that passed the grade. After he asked about the other kid, she told him she can\u00b4t find his raport. So, my brother looked online at the enrolment for the next year and saw this child has to repeat a year. She covers up all sorts of stuff, trying to make herself look like the awesome parent and my brother like the horrible one. She lies and when you caught her, she just denies ever saying that. My brother doesn\u00b4t hear about anything about the childern- only when he needs to pay for something, she will tell him to sent x-amount of money.\n\nPeople, there are lots more, which I don\u00b4t remember right now. She is ruining lovely childern, for selfish reasons.\n\nShe was on a visa for spouses, but since they are seperated for over 5 years now, her visa has expired and she\u00b4s basically illegaly in the country. (She does\u00b4t come from a poor country.) She\u00b4s the type of person to make no effort to getting important stuff done, (She threw away an important letter form the school, that she had to reply to.) so I am pretty sure she\u00b4s without a visa in the counrty. Her name is not on the birth certificates of the childern, so if she gets deported, she can\u00b4t take them with her, I supose.\n\nSo, should I tip off Immigration, or would that just be another trauma added to the children?\n\n(This is not happening in the USA, for anyone wondering)\n\nAny advice for my brother?",

For the most part, we get along fine, but we don\u2019t always see eye to eye on certain things. One big difference is how we view boundaries. I like to keep things clear\u2014what\u2019s mine is mine\u2014and she\u2019s a bit more casual about that sort of thing.\n\nI own a car, and Jenna doesn\u2019t. She usually takes the bus or gets rides from friends when she needs to go somewhere. A couple of times, she\u2019s asked if she could borrow my car, but I\u2019ve always said no. It\u2019s not a trust thing\u2014I just don\u2019t like other people driving my car. It\u2019s my name on the insurance, and I\u2019m the one who handles all the costs if something goes wrong.\n\nAnyway, last week, Jenna burst into my room in a full-on panic. She said her sister had a medical emergency and was being rushed to the hospital. She begged me to let her borrow my car because an Uber would take too long, and there were no buses running. I told her I don\u2019t let anyone drive my car, but I\u2019d drive her to the hospital myself. She got mad and said she didn\u2019t want me \u201chovering\u201d and making things \u201cmore stressful.\u201d\n\nWhen I said no, she stormed out and called me selfish. She ended up getting a ride from a friend, but now she\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder and barely speaking to me. On top of that, she\u2019s been telling our mutual friends what happened, and most of them think I\u2019m a jerk for not letting her borrow the car in an emergency. A few people agree with me, saying it\u2019s my property and I had the right to say no, but now I\u2019m questioning if I was too harsh.\n\nI get that she was in a bad spot, but I feel like I was put in a no-win situation. If she had crashed the car or something happened, I\u2019d be on the hook for it. Still, it was an emergency, and maybe I should\u2019ve just helped her out.\n\nSo, AITAH?",

            "body": "AITAH for suggesting to my sister that she get an official OCD diagnosis or else stop saying she has it? My sister (49) sometimes refers to \"her OCD\" in the context of liking something that is very organized. She has made comments like this before, and did so again this past week while visiting for the holidays. \"My OCD loves this \\[pegboard jewelry organizer\\].\" I inquired as to when she was diagnosed with OCD and she said she wasn't, and I mentioned that it was a debilitating clinical disorder, but it went no further than anecdotes about innocuous-seeming particularities about spatial arrangements.\n\nWith the dust settled a bit on holiday travel etc, I decided to carefully bring it up again by text. I linked to a New Yorker comic strip by actor Phillip Ettinger and cartoonist Jason Katzenstein. (For context, I am a costume professional in film & TV and what I am revealing about Phil here is nothing he has not been completely open and candid about such as in the aforementioned comic.) I said, \"I worked with Phil last year and for us on a daily basis it just meant we needed to provide him with clean underwear, and lay socks out one on each shoe, or else he couldn't get dressed. But it also meant he was 5 hours late for his fitting. Obviously this would be unsustainable in some careers but a diagnosis of OCD means some workplace accommodations and protections under the ADA. If you think this would be beneficial to you, you might want to look into getting diagnosed. If not, then you should consider not saying \"My OCD\" because it minimizes the disability that it truly is.\" \n\nShe was SUPER offended. She was offended that I insinuated that she was minimizing it, that I was minimizing HER suffering, I'm gaslighting her, I'm a hypocrite because I don't follow her health advice, I wrongly assumed she hasn't researched it, I sound just like our dad, I'm not supportive because I haven't asked her about her experiences with OCD and how it does affect her, and that I don't believe her, while doubling down on her assertion that she does have it and doesn't need a diagnosis because she doesn't want to be medicated (which I never suggested nor even mentioned) or stigmatized.\n\nShe is correct on the last point, in that I do not necessarily believe her, and I will explain why. One thing she does do very compulsively is TALK, mostly about herself, and so much so that it's the often the primary observation people make about her and her voice dominates every space she occupies. In allll the talking she does about herself, we hear loads about her other myriad medical conditions and the struggles with the limitations, the various medical and alternative care she receives, getting to the care, paying for the care, etc. We also hear tons about her work, her bosses, her coworkers, her roommate, her apartment (yes normal stuff but in high volume in both senses of the word, and very disproportionate to the contributions of the rest of the family conversation.) But one thing we never actually hear about is anything that sounds like clinical OCD behavior, or how it affects her life, or anything different that she does to compensate for it. Literally the only time it comes up is how she likes things spatially arranged, and she sounds like someone who is ignorant of the meaning of the disorder and just thinks its an annoying/cute \"quirk\" like a Monica from \"Friends.\"\n\nRegardless of whether I believe her or not, I tried hard to frame my original proposition very neutrally to leave the possibility that maybe she does have some serious struggles that maybe I'm not aware of (she lives 2000 miles away and I generally only see her once every couple years). In between the rapid-fire font of defensiveness and accusations that spewed forth after my original text, I did point out that she \\*sounds\\* like \"those people\" who don't really have it nor understand it.. but mostly just referred back to the possibility of getting a diagnosis from a professional which I am not, in order to ease her theoretical challenges in the workplace and elsewhere (because the definition of disorder is that it disrupts normal physical or mental functions, right?)\n\nSo anyway, it has devolved from there. There is no question that I SHOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT IT UP, but was it a generally assholey thing to do on my part or is her reaction a little, uh \\*outsized\\*?",

She was smirky and giggly when apologizing to me. \n\nShe has a hard time saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. So we allow her to write it down. Last time she apologized, she did. So I thanked her for the letter and asked her to say it out loud next time. That brings us to the recent apology: she read it from her letter, being silly and staring straight at the page. Like your husband, I said \u201cthank you for apologizing, but your delivery doesn\u2019t seem sincere.\u201d And I\u2019m sure it came across as me not accepting her apology. \n\nOur counselor helped illuminate the child\u2019s experience here - How hard it must be for her to come to me and apologize, bc I have pretty high expectations (perfectionist) and tend to keep moving the bar for her to reach; so she must feel frustrated that anything she does is never good enough for me, and so she probably just doesn\u2019t care anymore\u2026\n\nI am the asshole. Learning this is making me change to prioritize the relationship and connection with my SD, over trying to perfect the skills she is struggling to develop, right now.  I need to trust that she is learning well enough to be successful in \u201cthe real world\u201d - because that\u2019s probably your husband\u2019s goal too, focused on the long term, when we need to focus on just the moment.\n\nSo, you may not be the asshole; but he may need to hear how his actions affect the relationship with the kids (and probably ultimately you too) from an outside source. Because I know I couldn\u2019t hear it from my wife\u2026",

            "body": "AITAH\u2026I just want to be left alone now\u2026.I felt so betrayed when my ex would do this to me. I\u2019d expressed to him that my goal in a relationship was to allow such a deep bond that it would feel like, it was us against the world. \n\nI had believed in my capacity to love a man in such a way that he\u2019d feel that love for him and do just about anything to protect me. \n\nMaybe this is what made me a narcissist to him, but once he started taking the sides of others my mind went to thinking, he should know me well enough to see and feel and understand my love for him.\n\n I\u2019m a veteran and had prior life experience before meeting this guy so it\u2019s not like I hadn\u2019t \nlived life without him. I knew how to conduct myself in business so I know how to hold a conversation with anyone and that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m a flirt, it means that I\u2019m human and am able to hold a conversation with another. I was not to allowed to talk to other men Ina polite manner. If I smiled or spoke to another man outside of his comfort zone it was me reckless eye balling but this guy could be whispering to another woman or even tasting a woman\u2019s drink in my face. \n\nOne night at the bar while we were hopping , a couple of ladies approached me asking me if that\u2019s my guy. They were trying to save me but I was wrapped around his pinky. \n\nThey were telling me how much of a pig he was. Telling me how gorgeous I was and how he was trying to get with her friend here right in my face. But here I am genuinely having conversations with people while out at the bar. \n\nNow I\u2019m at the point to where I just want to be alone and he\u2019s living with me due to being evicted from what used to be our home due to inability to pay his rent.  I\u2019m reminding him that we\u2019re not together. \n\nYes bc he\u2019s here we do have relations from time to time but. I keep clear boundaries to let him as the true narcissist know he does not live here. He does not have a key. He does not receive mail here. He sleeps on my couch. He does not drive my car. \n\nThis man is a terrorist in my home and he called me a narcissist the other day. I want to be alone because I enjoy my company over him mentally and emotionally torturing me. \n\nLike I know all about him and how he ignores me while he\u2019s out as if I don\u2019t exist to him while he\u2019s around others. \n\nWell f u because you are disrespectful to me as well as cheating on me. I want to be alone and raise our daughter to not deal with men like him. \n\nSo I\u2019ve shared with him that he is on a timer. He needs to get his license so that we can get this car transferred to his name. He needs to get up to date on payments, and start saving to move out because all of this going out staying gone and then ignoring my calls when he is out and comes back to my place showering and all this single behavior. You need to move in with whoever you\u2019re staying with while you\u2019re ignoring me or get your place now because you will not treat my home as a place to rest and rejuvenate to go out and binge then come back to shower and do it all over again. It\u2019s disgusting to me to see my daughter\u2019s father this way.\n\n I need him gone asap. He called me a narcissist but I can\u2019t even make requests like close my toilet or close the bathroom door because I don\u2019t want the light to wake the baby. He told me o ask too much of him. This is enough to make a woman go crazy. I ask of too much when you don\u2019t even have a job. Living under me and taking my little resources while you tell me my life isn\u2019t together?!! He\u2019s 42yo living with his 36y ex girlfriend bc he got evicted due to inability to pay rent. \n\nI need my space back because atp he\u2019s becoming a terrorist in my home. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a narcissist because I listed all the reasons why I don\u2019t want to live or be in a relationship with him. He told me I\u2019m the type of woman who doesn\u2019t need my own place. I get a little bit of power and don\u2019t know what to do with it. I\u2019m sorry I keep asking you if you could put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher because I don\u2019t want dirty dishes sitting in my sink. \n\nMy gosh I asked you to put the toilet lid down again. Like how are you going to attempt to assert your male dominance on me in my home?!! You don\u2019t pay for a single thing not even your daughter\u2019s diapers and yet you\u2019re the head who needs to be respected???? lol am being delulu? Please help.",

            "body": "AITA for not inviting my best friend to my wedding?\n\nTo start off, this is the first time I have posted on here, so bear with me. My best friend had been my roommate all four years of college, and we got really close. We were in a lot of the same extracurriculars, and on top of that since we lived together, we were always hanging out. After we graduated, we haven\u2019t hung out as often, but it has been less than a year since we have graduated. I still consider her my best friend, although we haven\u2019t spent time together as often as we would have when we lived together. She is also very busy and works in the healthcare industry and has weird schedules, so it is kind of rare when she does get a chance to hang out with friends. About a month ago, I asked her if she wanted to be one of my bridesmaids, as I am getting married. She was super excited and and seemed like she was very happy to be asked. About a week after I asked her, she texted me a cryptic message. She said she was worried about finances and the budget of being a bridesmaid and was just stressed out about the whole situation. I understand under normal circumstances that being a bridesmaid can be a big expense, but I just graduated as well and I am aware of everybody\u2019s budget. The only thing that I asked the bridesmaids to get was their dress, which was less than $100. Other than that, I planned on paying for anything else such as bachelorette party expenses, etc. When she said she was worried, I kept thinking of solutions to where we could come to a compromise. I was asking her what her budget was, if I could help out with expenses, and if there was anything else I could help with. She kept saying that she didn\u2019t know if any of that would help and that this whole process was just stressing her out, mind you I didn\u2019t ask her to help me with anything at all at this point, only to think about buying a dress before the wedding. She then started saying that she has having problems with her car, that she didn\u2019t know where she was going to stay, although I tried to help her with solutions to those as well except every single solution that I came up with it seems like she would come up with another problem or excuse. To add, she does not pay any bills, and she still lives with her parents, so she is not paying rent and she has a job, that I mentioned before. I even offered for her to be a regular guest instead of a bridesmaid to take the pressure off, but she didn\u2019t like that solution either. The way that she was texting me was excuse after excuse and she was honestly saying it in kind of a rude way. I kept trying to call her to figure out the situation, but she purposely was declining my calls, so I decided to leave it alone. A few days later she texted me, saying that she would \u201ctry her best to be there\u201c but she couldn\u2019t promise me anything. This may be selfish of me, but I feel like $100 is not that big of an expense, and I would be willing to pay that much for a bridesmaids dress for a best friend, even though I actually have bills to pay. After this happened, I kind of decided that I would wait for her to text me and see if she would make the effort of being a friend. She hasn\u2019t really reached out, and now I am thinking I shouldn\u2019t even send her an invite to the wedding at all. AITA?",

There has been a lot of good, but there has been a whole lot of bad too. He has an issue with drinking and has ended up in the hospital twice because the drinking got out of control. And he did cheat on me with at least one girl that I know of, although his argument was that it was 10 years ago. But currently I catch him in tons of tiny little stupid lies like saying he walked the dogs when he didn't, talking to ppl that he says he didn't, and more commonly if I ask if he has been drinking. But the behavior now that is making me crazy is that every night on his way home from work he stops at this parking lot that is about 12 min away from home and is there for sometimes up to 2 hours. I will call him and ask what he is doing and he will say that he is on the phone with someone from work, which he is a supervisor for a crew of 5 ppl or so that do repairs. But we have had quite a few conversations where I tell him that by him doing that it is trying to dip into a trust reserve that is not there because he depleted it and has not been built back up by him with all of the little lies that he says all the time. I have had conversations with him many times asking him why he has to have the conversations in that parking lot rather than home, and the reasons he comes up with are weak at best. 'I don't want to disturb you', 'I can't focus when I am driving and talking', (for context by the time he gets to the parking lot he has already driven a 1 hour drive home from work and I have been in the car with him many times when he has gotten a phone call and he talked and drove no problem) 'I wanted to wash my work truck' (there is a self serve car wash here, but this is a 8-9p and it was 50 degrees out). I have explained that it is a trigger for me and makes me feel really uneasy and could he just come home and have the conversations here, to which he agrees....but then he goes right back to it the next day. When I point out that he said he would stop, he tells me that I am crazy and that anyone would be ok with it because it is work. \n\nI know the easy answer is that if I do not trust him I should just leave, but I have a 16 year old, who has viewed him as a father figure since she was 4. She has a terrible relationship with her biological  father and my bf has stepped in to fill areas where her father has lacked. Him leaving before she goes off to college would blow up the family in a way that I may or may not be ready for. But, it is something that I need to be sure that it is not me being crazy and acting emotional before I make a big change.",

We've been through a lot of milestones together, traveled together, briefly lived together, family Christmases, etc. \nIn 2019, my life took a nose dive. I've always been a bit impulsive and thought I was bipolar at one point. So after being SA'd, pandemic, death in the family, other family and friends drama; I was just having break down after break down. I couldn't seem to keep masking my depression any more and was doing anything and everything I could to try. This included lying, spending money I didn't have, not answering calls/texts or anything from anyone, including this friend, for fear of facing my problems. \nSince mid-2024, I've been trying to really work on myself and be more honest with myself and in therapy, so I stop hurting myself and others. I've gotten some MH diagnoses that help me understand the ways my mind works with my emotions, continuing to work on myself. \nAll of this to say, that I have apologized to many people for my previous actions. I've kept them informed on my progress and what I've learned about myself and how I'm really working on getting better. \nThis one friend, who I do think I may have hurt most, does not respond to the messages. \nI know what I did was wrong and I'm still trying to be better, I know I'm not there 100% yet. \nI don't want to give them an ultimatum or rush them to forgive me if they feel they may never be able to. Nothing like that. \nI just want to stop staring at my phone waiting to hear from them. I don't want to unfriend them because I'm angry they're not answering. I want to do it because I want to force myself to stop waiting, to stop torturing myself with their silence. \nThey may never forgive me, either way, we'll never have the friendship we once did. I know that, I do. I just feel like accepting that this is the way it is, to fully make myself accept that if they want to reach out, they have to take the step, that I need to stop messaging them, is to distance myself and just keep working on my end. Not block them just unfriend them. \nI know I was the ah in the past but does this make me the ah now?",

This sub was lost to porn bots long ago.  \n\nThere's thousands now upvoting each other to keep their farm going.  The only vicious cycle is the one caused by the mods' complete lack of action banning the bots when they're caught.  If the post or comment is taken down but account stays up, then the bot still got the karma history they wanted and can downvote/upvote as they wanted.   The bot wins.  \n\nThe only solution was to ban.  The mods didn't.  The mods gave up the sub when they made that call years ago.  We're now seeing the results of how every single post gets flooded with bots.  \n\nThe only issue was the mods not banning the bots.  That would have cut the cycle.  Sure new ones would get made, but they wouldn't have been upvoted by banned bots.  \n\nYou act like the issue is that most posts are getting ***called*** fake.   The real issue is that most posts ***are*** fake.   The mods lost the war way before they realized it was as issue.  They shrugged it off as not a big deal and now the sub is completely fake.  \n\nThe sub has been lost to the bots and its so far gone that it's taking other subs down with it as the bots branch out.",

There are 6 beds total, 3 on the left 3 on the right, and a small lounge/living area in the middle. On the left, there's myself, roommate 2, and roommate 3. On the right, there is roommate 4, and roommate 5. I am close with roommates 2 and 4, and they are also super tight with each other. Roommate 3 is pretty neutral, but we are worried about Roommate 5.   \n\n\nWe reached out to R5 to try to get to know them better but haven't received a response. Upon looking at their social media, we do not have too much in common. They appear to be Disney adults, weirder in general (kind of annoying?), and two years older than the rest of us, yet they appear to be much more immature than the rest of us. \n\nWe agreed to reach out and see what's up before we do anything. But R4 is not down to live with R5. Overall, R4 feels uncomfortable with this person. R2 and I agree, but ultimately think that R4 needs to have a conversation with them about the compatibility issue, as she will be living with them for a school year.\n\nIs it bad that we are trying to get R5 out of our room reservation? I guess I will come back and add on if R5 responds. Any ideas on how to possibly get her to not room with us (without being like douches?)",

We unpacked everything and was going to turn the uhaul back in after getting gas when she ran over a pole at the gas station and ripped the gas line on the uhaul. Fast forward hours of waiting I start getting acid reflux as I live daily with gastritis and gerd. I told her yo you brought me out here , I have nobody to pick me up and I'm starving. Everything around us only sold foods I couldnt eat. I couldnt find a single thing without citric acid , garlic or something that I'm not allowed to have especially during a flare like I was having from an empty stomach. Bascially we got into a huge argument about why she cant just wait in the gas station for the people who said they were gonna be 2 hrs !!!! While I get taken home by the other person there helping and she was still unwilling. I lost it and started screaming how shes so selfish and it's not my fault that this happened. It wouldnt hurt her to wait in the gas station as I was already doing a favor by helping her move in. I told her the truth of the matter , she always asks for favors and I have to suffer under her thumb. Eventually a friend came and got me and took me home but I still feel bad for the argument. I told her she lost me as a sister and theres no way I'll speak to her again because she was okay with letting me suffer in a flare. I said I'll get my nephews from their father when I want to see them or have them on my time. Not hers anymore beings everytime I do her a favor it goes awry.",

Our budget is not super high and the housing market has been extreme in our area. Homes where we want to live have been skyrocketing from the upper 180s to now nearly 320+. We found a home not on the market that fit perfectly in our budget. To make things even sweeter, the home would be sold without an agent and under market price (home appraised for 320 selling for 250). The home is move in ready as opposed to the fixer uppers we have been looking at as they are the only houses in our price range with the size and yard we are looking for. This would be my wife and my families first house we owned. I knew it was next door to my sister, so I asked her 2 weeks ago what her thoughts were on the subject of me living next door to her or making an offer on the house. I hear nothing for 2 weeks. With the market how it is, 2 weeks is ages, as houses in our area sell in days if priced obnoxiously, let alone priced well. I even had to ask them for the neighbors phone number so I could contact them about making an offer. My sister and her husband gave me the phone number. After talking to the neighbor and coming up with an offer I get a text from my sister about how she values her privacy and how she knows the market is tough but this is about what's right for her and doesn't want her not wanting me to have the house affect our relationship. I've missed out on so many opportunities to not ruffle feathers or doing things for others. Am I the asshole for wanting to put my own families needs above my sister's wants?",

I've always been autistic but I couldn't receive the help I needed growing up because the schools thought \"well she's passing her classes so she's not autistic\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\", hence it caused me to grow up with no help all my life. My family fought hard to get someone to listen to me but no one did. Last Wednesday, I was finally diagnosed with Autism. At fcking age 23. I know nothings changed, but I feel like everything's changed at the same time. Getting diagnosed has given me confidence; for me to finally put my foot down and explain to family stuff that I REALLY don't like, and what are my triggers. Well, before getting diagnosed and for a few years now, my cousin has been getting on my nerves lately since he's at that age where he's able to be vocal and say words. When he was a baby/toddler he didn't bother me because he didn't say anything. But now he's at that age range where he just talks but not very clearly. Both of us are autistic but he can't communicate clearly; the only thing he can do is just SCREAM and gets his sticky fingers on me and babble like a baby. I've tried to explain to family that I REALLY don't like it when he gets close to me because of his sticky hands and his lack of boundaries, but they always tell me \"he's a baby he doesn't know better don't be mean to him\ud83e\udd7a\" but I swear I'm not trying to be mean! All my life I had to change and have my boundaries broken to make others happy, I don't think it's that hard to just ask the parents AND him to please don't touch me and scream. No one will listen to me. Yes, he's 10 and doesn't know better BUT ALSO why should I have my boundaries not respected? I'm autistic too and I matter too. Is there any advice to REALLY set my foot down? Is there any advice on how to speak to another autistic person who is affecting your triggers? I really feel awful for feeling this way and I just want to know what to do that can make everyone happy",

But he knows he has them and that makes me feel uncomfortable. His reasoning for not deleting them is because he doesn't want to \"alter the past\" but my argument was that deleting photos of an ex doesn't mean you're altering the past. The past happened. They broke up over 5 years ago. I had an ex who said he doesnt delete photos even if they're old so I think my mind is trying to make a connection since that ex and I had a really bad falling out. I feel like this relationship isn't gonna go anywhere because he can't seem to \"let go\" of an old relationship. Maybe I won't trip until later on once we have been together for longer time and if we decide to get married. So Reddit, AITAH for this?",

We both had known each other from childhood but we got in a relationship after we had turned 16.\nSo last year she had cleared her SSC examination and she chose Maths as one of her main subjects even though she wasn't interested in it. When I asked her about it she said that her dad wanted her to do this but I knew that she wanted to study biology as one of the main subjects. I knew for a fact that she was interested in biology much more than maths and she used to talk about taking biology but because of her father she didn't choose the thing she was interested in. So I asked her if I could talk to her dad about it but she refused and at last she didn't listen to me and she went to junior clg taking Maths as her main subject.\n\nAfter 1-2 months she wasn't doing well in her studies and I used to say that we can change her streams now too but she didn't listened to me at that time. One day she talked to me about something and it was about her ex. She told me that her ex and I both were good in maths. Ofcourse I didn't liked that but still we continued our conversation and after some time she asked me some tips for studying maths. I knew that this day would come and so I told her that we can still change the streams and she started to cry and told me that she needs some space (i forgot to mention but we were in a LDR). When we both were talking again she told me that she felt unworthy and failure when I said that. For context her past wasn't good as her ex was not a good person. She told me that I never make her feel worthy and same stuff about it but let me tell you I used to agree on almost most of her demands as she was the one I used to love. She wanted to meet her male best friend , i agreed, she was in touch with her ex i never once complained about anything. \n\nSo was I wrong about this whole situation? Did I really make her feel unworthy and failure just by saying something like this?",

You've already said your peace, you know she would be happier doing the major she enjoys, but she's not listening to you. Can't keep beating a dead horse.\n\nNow, seeing as you're young, I'm going to tell you this right now - sometimes, when a women tells you about a problem, she does NOT want a solution; we just want to rant about something or someone and your job (as the boyfriend/husband/friend) is to STFU and agree with us. Her breaking down seems like she just wanted to air frustration and you went into your \"me big strong man. Me fix!\" which is not what she wanted.\n\nHowever, this doesn't sound like an isolated incident and I would caution you to really think about this relationship. It sounds like she's not taking anything you say into consideration, even when you're trying to help. At the same time, you're trying to fix a problem that she 1. doesn't want fixed or 2. already has plans to fix herself.\n\nI would apologize for hurting her feelings and that while you're trying to help, you trust her to know her own situation and life. Stop bringing up changing majors unless she actually ASKS you to help her with that. If she just wants rant about how dumb math is and how nothing makes sense, you nod and agree. \"Yeah, math is so dumb! And your professor gave you a what? After all the work you did? Oh, fuck right off with that guy. He'd marry math if he could.\"",

Yes she blamed me for something I never did and this is true because when I asked her to give me proof she told me that I should remember it. So after giving thought I knew that breakup was the only option left for us and I did that. We had a few on and off relationships which I never wanted but I agreed as she needed space. \n \nIn one of those breaks she accused me that I was with her for her body. I was shocked because I never asked her to show her body. i come from a religious family and i hope you will understand how my upbringing was. When I told her it was all false she then started to cry  and we had to change the topic. \n\nAnd yes she never had any plans for her future. She used to change her dreams form day to day after seeing everything on social media.

            "body": "AITAH - So my husband (33yo) and I (32yo)recently found out that we are pregnant with our second child. We have been together for 15 years (high school sweethearts) and currently have a 6 year old son who, over the last 2 years, has been begging us to have another baby. We are all very excited about it except, it seems, my husband\u2019s grandmother. My \u201crelationship\u201d with his grandmother has always been precarious and not for lack of trying on my part to take the high road and show her kindness despite the lack of respect she has for me. \n\nJust to add some quick context to how she treats me: I have limited her interaction with me over the last few years but in the past and recent past she deliberately ignores me when I speak to her, tries to not include me in conversations, tells me to \u201cshut up\u201d under her breath when I am speaking to my husband in the same room as her (thankfully husband finally caught her and called her out on this) and she will glare at me when I am not looking directly at her (I can see her unmoving stare from my peripheral) and will immediate plaster a fake smile on when I do finally look her in the eyes. I could try and talk to her about anything and she would show me total indifference but if my husband were to talk to her about the same thing she would be so engaging and care about what he has to say about it. I have tried to ignore her behavior towards me in the past and I have also tried calling her out on it. She has never apologized and the most I get is \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry you took it that way\u201d a non-apology sort of response. She can be very manipulative and is only nice to me when she wants something or is worried I will limit my son\u2019s interactions with her. (Which I have had to do in the past due to other circumstances but I don\u2019t enjoy doing as he loves her so much). She has a habit of love bombing me for a while and making me believe she is now treating me better until it slowly starts to happen again. \n\nNow, back to the immediate issue at hand. My son has said to me in front of her many times over the last 2 years \u201cI want a baby! You and daddy need to have another baby\u201d to which she would respond for me \u201cNO\u201d or \u201cNo, No, I will buy you one\u201d. So upon telling my son the good news that he is going to be a big brother, he excitedly wanted to tell grandma whom he was visiting that day. Even though she tries to leave me out of things, I still choose to be civil and kind for the sake of my son who has a close relationship with her. So we arrive and my son is holding the ultrasound and as soon as we open the door he excited tells her \u201cI\u2019m going to be a big brother!\u201d She says to him \u201cNo you\u2019re not\u201d She then looks at me as I smile and nod my head and she says, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick\u201d. I decide to ignore her comment and tell her we just found out and that I am probably 8-10 weeks along. She then makes a comment about how I\u2019ve been pretty good bout keeping this a secret (meaning from her). I, again, ignore it and just repeat how we just found out a week and a half ago. I make small talk about how I won\u2019t be allowed to have a VBAC because our hospital in our rural town doesn\u2019t offer it so I would be having another c-section. She proceeds to ask me if I plan on having my tubes tied while they are in there. I am sure my face had a look of shock as I told her no, and that wasn\u2019t even on our minds. Never got a congratulations but she of course gave one to my husband.\n\nSo today my son innocently told her about us getting to find out the gender soon and how a friend of ours wants to give us the gift of a reveal cake. She of course said to me (husband not present) that gender reveals are this new and unnecessary thing and expressed her indifference towards them. Not that I owed her a response, but I told her I am not making a big party of it, just a little thing for just us as I looked down at my son and smiled. She didn\u2019t respond with nothing of substance but I think she took that as her being invited to our happy moment. Upon talking to my husband, she acts excited and tells him to please let her know when we are planning to do it (so she can of course insert herself. I am so incredibly offended by her reaction to the pregnancy and the audaciousness of that insinuating question about me getting my tubes tied that I have ultimately decided to have the gender reveal be a private moment for just myself, my husband and my son. My husband is in agreement with this and I can\u2019t help but feel a little guilty on behalf of my son wanting to include her. I guess I am on here to vent but also would like your input on how I plan to handle this. I am definitely keeping the reveal a private untainted moment for just my little family. But there most definitely will be petty retaliation on her part towards me. I plan on just doing the reveal and offering her photos (again taking the high road and including her to some extent) and if/when I get one of her little comments on this about how hurt she is I didn\u2019t include her, I will confront her on how she made me feel when he told her our good news.",

            "body": "Hi everyone.. \n\nSo my MIL's birthday recently passed at the beginning of February and finances have been tight. She said she wanted a $500 laptop and my husband was trying to go in half with his brother, but his brother had gotten a gift already. He ended up getting a $25 gift card and a nice card, paid for the family to go out to lunch, and drove hours away to see them.\n\nHe gets a call from his dad basically stating how disappointed they are in him. I guess the mom broke down crying the other night that all she's worth is a $25 gift card. My husband explained the situation about trying to get the laptop, but not having the money to do so, but also that he still wanted to make it happen, just as a surprise. When we went to visit for her birthday, we did a bunch of family fun activities, went out to dinner, saw a movie, did breakfast and lunch, etc. and thought we left on good terms so this phone call was a bit unexpected.\n\nThe dad basically said that mom was crying all night due to his actions and that they are both disgusted with him. He said the relationship will be strained moving forward as the mother doesn't easily get over things. He said she will remember this the rest of her life and their relationship will not be the same. She threw the gift on the ground and stated she didn't even want a $25 gift card and would rather give it away. His dad said this is just a normal part of being a son.\n\nNow, the father suggested buying the mother the laptop as a form of \"damage control\" to try to repair the relationship. I think that's crazy!! I was raised to be appreciative of any and all gifts as you don't know someone's financial place. His family has spoken out and shamed him about his job and has actively encouraged him not to seek out higher paying jobs when he mentions he's struggling.\n\nMy family and I are kind of leaning towards an advising him not to buy the laptop as it feels like just buying love and being threatened to buy a gift. WWYD in this situation- would you buy the gift as a form of damage control to repair the relationship or not buy it? Looking for feedback and advice!",

Definitely do NOT cave!\nIt sounds like you made a special effort to celebrate with her & spent possibly more than your husbands expected \"share\" of her demanded gift during the visit.\n\nIf they can't understand your circumstances, don't appreciate time spent & only rate love on dollars spent, there's no saving the relationship. \n\nI have an insane MIL & luckily have the support of my husband so i have successfully disconnected from her & her passive aggressiveness. \n\nIt sounds like she's completely unreasonable & wouldn't listen in a conversation,  so maybe write a REALLY carefully worded but heartfelt letter (understating it will probably forever be used as evidence against you) explaining that you don't have the funds to buy expensive gifts, apologise, even though you shouldn't have to, & explain that you are hurt that time spent in person isn't as valuable to her as an object, that is was this  item for her or your bills & food. \n\nIf that doesn't elicit an apology & some understanding then you've got your answer about how important YOU are to HER & it might be time to distance yourselves if you can. At the very least cut your emotional ties & just pay lip service but don't invest. \n\nGood luck",

I chat \"Chill out\" and \"*insert character he's playing* iz mvpp\", but the thing that really hurts me the most is when he insults me after I don't trash talk back. He says things like \"You're so tiring\" in a low tone or like \"I didn't ask for much\". To add more to it, I don't really like trash talking that much since it gets me really guilty since after all it's just a game but it's not like I don't defend my duo in any other ways.

            "body": "I (19M) have been with my girlfriend (18F) for a couple of months now. We\u2019ve had our ups and downs, but this time, I can\u2019t seem to shake what happened, and I\u2019m seriously considering ending the relationship.\n\nA couple of nights ago, I invited my girlfriend and her friend (let\u2019s call her Jane for the sake of this post) to join me at a party/club. I was running late, and since my girlfriend lives close to the club, she decided to head in without me. When I arrived, she had already been drinking and was carrying around two bottles of 5% alcohol. Why she needed two is beyond me, but it\u2019s important to the story.\n\nFor context:\nI\u2019ve been going through a really difficult time. A lot of close deaths have happened in recent weeks, and earlier that night, another close family member also passed. (Yes, I still went out after finding out \u2014I know people may judge, but that\u2019s how I chose to cope.) My grief was hitting an all-time high that night, and to add to that, my family has a history of alcohol abuse and the kind of aggression that can come with it. Alcohol abuse is important later\n\nAfter greeting some people at the club, I took my girlfriend outside because I wanted to tell her about the death that had just happened a few hours earlier. We decided to leave the club and head to a nearby restaurant to talk privately. While we were there, she suddenly started acting strange\u2014slurring her words and seeming really out of it. I took her to the public bathroom, and that\u2019s when she started vomiting.\n\nAs the night went on, her behavior got worse. She became hostile toward me\u2014screaming, swearing, and even hitting me when I tried to help. She kept demanding that I call Jane, but she couldn\u2019t unlock her phone (she was too out of it to manage it), and I didn\u2019t have service or data to contact anyone. This went on for about an hour. She yelled things like: \n     \n  \u2022\t\u201cI don\u2019t want you and I don\u2019t need you.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cF**k you.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019m actually going to hit you.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cUseless idiot.\u201d\n\nEventually, Jane got worried and came to find us. By that point, my girlfriend had completely blacked out, and I had to carry her out of the bathroom. It was a mess\u2014she was covered in vomit and had thrown up all over me. I even had to bribe the security staff not to call an ambulance for her.\n\nJane went to talk to my girlfriend\u2019s mom to prevent her from worrying too much, and while she was gone, things escalated again. We were in her bathroom, and my girlfriend seemed a little more coherent by then. I asked if she had meant everything she said earlier, and without hesitation, she snapped, \u201cI don\u2019t need or want you here. Get the f**k out. I only want Jane\u2014leave.\u201d \n\nI was already overwhelmed with grief, and hearing her say those things\u2014especially after everything else she had done and said that night\u2014really got to me. After asking multiple times if she really meant it, I finally left and went clubbing again with my friends. I know it was shitty to leave her, but she insisted, so I did.\n\nThe next morning, she texted me, thanking me for taking care of her and apologizing for how she acted. She said she didn\u2019t remember much and suspected she had been spiked. We ended up arguing, and I\u2019ll admit\u2014I said some things I\u2019m not proud of. I lashed out and called her embarrassing, said she was disgusting to be seen with, and told her I wanted to end things and that I didn\u2019t love her anymore. I know those words were cruel, and I\u2019ve apologized profusely since then and that I didn\u2019t mean to say I wanted to end things\n\nBut here\u2019s where I\u2019m struggling\u2014and I\u2019d really appreciate blunt honesty.\n\nI can\u2019t understand how she could be so careless about leaving her drinks unattended. And more than that, I can\u2019t wrap my head around the way she spoke to me and hit me. Im gonna be completely honest im not entirely sure if she\u2019s just saying she thinks she got spiked so I excuse it but her story seems to add up but im not sure with her. Anyway whether she was sober or not. I know that would explain a lot of her behavior, but I still believe that drunk actions reveal sober thoughts\u2014and that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me the most.\n\nTo be fair, she\u2019s never acted this way toward me before. She has a playful, sassy personality and will jokingly hit me sometimes, but nothing remotely close to what happened that night. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just extra sensitive because of everything I\u2019m going through, but I can\u2019t see her the same after that night.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2014before this happened, our relationship was going incredibly well. I could genuinely see a future with her. She has apologized a lot and says she\u2019s deeply sorry for everything she said. She can\u2019t give me an explanation for why she said those things because she doesn\u2019t remember anything after we entered the restaurant. She\u2019s tried to reassure me and has been making an effort, but I just don\u2019t know how to move past it.\n\nThings haven\u2019t been the same since that argument with both sides she\u2019s been colder because of what I said about her and im still holding a grudge because of what happened I don\u2019t want to end things with her but I just can\u2019t shake this feeling I really need someone to put me in my place about this if im wrong.",

                    "body": "As I was reading her behavior, I was thinking her drink might have been spiked, even before I read that she said it. It's not really fair to blame people for their drinks getting spiked, spiking people's drinks is wrong. You're rightfully going through a lot so that was probably a lot to hear, and you're allowed to have questions and be upset. Research how being drugged with roofies makes people act, it could have been very scary for her and your relationship is still pretty new. You're allowed to ask her why she might have said things like that. Maybe she was scared, but asking questions and being genuinely curious is important.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, you both went out for drinks at a time when you're emotionally vulnerable/sensitive, which is how you cope- I understand that. It's a shitty situation, but that doesn't mean someone close to you needs to be blamed. The person who spiked her drink should be blamed, and the blame shouldn't be on her just bc no one knows who spiked the drink. I hope that makes sense, and I really hope you can be with your loved ones at the time. Take it slow. Don't try to push your feelings down. When my mom passed away, I was in therapy with a very sweet therapist and I recommend it.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso if her drink didn't end up being spiked and she was just really drunk, I think it warrants you being curious. You don't have to, you can always decide that's not for you. It's ok to just step away and say that's not a type of person you want in your life, even if you just need a break, given your family history. Feel free to take what resonates with you and leave what doesn't.\u00a0",

Finally we agreed , after a very difficult day for me, he would cook me dinner at his house and we would sit watch a movie and \u201cget to know each other better and \u201cat first I was reluctant, but we seem to have great chemistry, so I agreed. We got to his house, and he had an amazing steak & onions dinner on the stove for us. neither of us had a car but in our city, the buses are pretty good so he told me how to get to him from my place. I insisted he meet me at the bus stop to walk Me to his place. I got off the bus and give him an awkward. Side hug as most people do these days. But he grabbed my breast. I was uncomfortable and pushed him away. Told him I wasn\u2019t ready for that yet.At  his house. He invited me to sit outside because the weather was nice, but I joked and said I needed the washroom first getting out of the washroom, he was at the stove, checking dinner dinner after another side hug he again fondled my breasts and butt when I suggested we sit outside till dinner was ready. he Then quite forcefully pushed me up against the counter back to him and aggressively fondled my breasts and butt, while grinding his genitals against me. It was then I knew I was in trouble, but was working in my head very hard, how to get out of it. We eat dinner and he was not willing to listen about my bad day but started to yell at me and give his opinion on addictions and homelessness because the job I have is at a homeless shelter. At one point, he even said he didn\u2019t know if he could date someone who worked that job. He continued to yell at me about addictions and homelessness to the point that I became very silent, sat back and let him rant. literally not saying a word for 15 minutes, maybe more, using everything I knew from work, I tried to de-escalate the situation. I even suggested we sit and watch a movie and get to know each other better by talking. He got me another beer headed it to me and we went into his living room after something, he said, I said, you know I could always leave and we can do this another night, or not. But by this time he was scary yelling so I forcefully put down the beer. He just gave me told him I was leaving. I just needed my glasses and my phone, which made him more angry, I gathered my stuff and myself and left. When I left, I realized I wasn\u2019t sure which way we came from the bus because I was so upset so I texted my son and told him not to worry about me, my date was a total ass and I\u2019m already leaving. I\u2019m just trying to figure out where to get the bus son said don\u2019t take the bus. I\u2019m coming to get you and he did while in his car.( my son\u2019s car) trying to keep it together, but failing miserably, I gave him a very vanilla version of what happened. But my son pushed when he saw how upset I was and insisted I tell him what happened.. when he heard the story as we were driving home, my son insisted I called the police because that was attempted\u201d Date Grape\u201d\n\nSo I agreed to call the local police non-emergency number to get the advice of one of the officers on duty.\nThey agreed it was attempted date grape and came and took a report.

It just makes the rest of us smile at this point, since he is incredibly consistent in misjudging how late he will be on. \n\nThat being said, this individual also happens to be the one that likes to complain that he buys games to then never play them again. Which kind of makes sense, but on the other hand also makes us feel like our perspective isnt seen. Me and the mate who dont live at out parents, like to come back from work, do our errands and just relax and play a game for a bit. We dont have parents or siblings around to watch a movie with, go out for dinner with or whatever. If we haven't got any plans for the weekend, heck we might even start  in the afternoon from time to time. \n\nThe expectation seems to be for us to wait for them to get online to play certain games. Which is where my AITAH question lies. My mate living at his parents, barely speaks to us during the week at all. It's not the only group I'm around, and other friend do ask me to play all sorts of games, sometimes including titles the other group wants to play too. \n\nThe question would be, who is the real AH here, if anyone? \n\nThe one that expects a mate to not play a game untill he is online too, but then barely gets online?  Or the one that plays the game with other friends, and loses interest in the game before they get to play it with other mates?",

            "body": "AITAH for locking a door and sitting on a bed?\nI 21F am currently on vacation with my family. We are staying at a hotel. We went to the pool in the hotel and after talking for a while I decided I wanted to go to our room to take a shower. I mentioned this to my parents 53F 54M and my oldest sister 33F, and they said they'd be up shortly. I went ahead and got to our shared room and locked it, so you could only open it from the inside. MIND YOU, I did not dothis on purpose, more like a natural response as a young female getting into a room alone. I got in the bath and started filling it up, when all of a sudden my sister called me SCREAMING. That she had to pee, and she couldn't get in. I laugh, thinking she is screaming as a joke, but quickly realize that she is actually mad. I get out of the bath and open the door to the room. My parents and my sister start yelling at me because \"I'm so stupid to close the door when I knew they were coming.\" Of course, I get mad because I thought that I could take a bath, and they would still be downstairs. Since I was in the bath for maybe 5 minutes. I don't really understand the point of me going alone if they were basically just gonna follow behind. They did say that I could wait for them to go up, but if someone told u that you would think they would be a while, right? Apparently not, anyway they were really mad at me, and I said \"this is so stupid,\" and as I said this, my dad threatened to hit me for being an idiot/? (I guess, ugly spanish language was used, there is no English word to describe it) As you can imagine I'm frustrated and get into the bathroom, but by this time my mood is gone. I just wanted to have a nice bath, and I couldn't have that, so I got out and got dressed.\n\n[Context for the next part]\nWe have a room with 2 beds and a sofa/bed (idk how else to say it) my other sister 27F and her husband 29M are going to stay with us, and they are going to sleep in the sofa/bed.\n\nI finished getting dressed and just sat in bed with my phone with a mean mug. I was upset because I didn't do anything wrong in my eyes, I LITERALLY just locked a door and felt like their response was overexagerated. The room is kind of cold so I take my stuff and go to the sofa/bed and just kinda lay down with my feet hanging off (I had my shoes on) and a blanked on my lap. My sister 32F comes screaming at me as to why I'm in a bed that is not the one we agreed to use. I stare dumbfounded as I explain that it is cold over there. I get yelled at again for \"trying all the beds in the room\" and \"leaving my sisters bed feeling like it was used.\" You can imagine my face, because we are in a hotel. That bed HAS BEEN USED ALREADY FOR STRANGERS, but I am sitting there after I JUST SHOWERED, which is somehow the worst thing in the universe\n\nSo, Am I the asshole for sitting on my sister's bed, and locking the door?\n\nGuess I'm making this post, because I feel like I'm going crazy. Everyone in my family is always acting as if I'm the worst person in the world.\n\n\nI'll update you with more vacations from hell soon.",

Research indicates placental previa occurs in about 1/800 pregnancies, placental abruption occurs in about 10% of those cases, when bleeding is present in the 3rd trimester.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 - Even a numbskull would understand that Placenta previa means a c-section (exit blocked). I can\u2019t really see him thinking a c-section is unwarranted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n-If he wanted the pregnancy, why would he risk hurting the baby? Even if he thought pelvic rest was unnecessary.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n-The OB in the story acted very oddly. I just can\u2019t see them trying to intervene like that. That\u2019s not been my experience anyway. They pretty much stick to medical things (yes this is not ideal). Refer her to the hospital social worker maybe.\u00a0Where did the pamphlets come from? Her back pocket?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-If she was having life threatening bleeding, liters of blood, that\u2019s an ambulance ride. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n-She had life threatening bleeding at 8 months pregnant and they DID NOT keep her until the end of the pregnancy! Especially knowing the home environment isn\u2019t safe? WTF. There is no mention that she is uninsured or left AMA. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-The energy and wherewithal to try to leave a domestic violence situation at 33 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-If she has her own money and cards, why did she take his card? Especially since it could be tracked.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n-Little effort to hide her identity, even using her first name at one point.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n-Incredible, super human speed in getting and consulting a divorce lawyer, unless they know someone.\u00a0\n\n-Energy and wherewithal to write the long posts and replies why in this situation and less than a day out of surgery. I could not even post a picture until discharged.\n\n-He would not be let in to see her; she\u2019d probably be in the ICU recovering from the c-section and blood loss.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n-Where was the SIL when he came to confront her? \u00a0\n\n-C section incisions are usually low on the pelvic not across the belly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-Too much writing and trying to justify everything in a crisis situation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The worst part of this story, if it is indeed fake, is that it may get picked up by the wider media and go viral. Like\u00a0the extremely suspect story of the guy who got a positive pregnancy and it turned out to be cancer (as told by his friend).\u00a0Leaving everyone wondering about this lady she the baby. Maybe even police investigating. \u00a0 Ok. Rant over.",

For one, they are two very different things and I\u2019m not sure in what order the OP said they happened but typically Placenta Previa is not something that just happens, the placenta is over the cervix very early on (from what I know). Placenta Abruptio on the other hand, typically comes from trauma (usually a fall) but I highly doubt the the placenta would detach especially if it was already over the cervix\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So VERY VERY unlikely she could have both. Also, yes patients with placenta previa would need a c-section. That is because the placenta is covering the cervix (where the baby would exit in a vaginal birth).

He violated clear boundaries with this employee, which led to a major fallout and him temporarily moving out after that employee shared with me what was going on. This forced me to juggle loads of work drama, while supporting my husband in the temporary housing - all while processing my own hurt. \n\t\u2022\tRecently, after I gave him permission to hook up with someone, he explicitly crossed the one boundary I had set. When confronted, he lied multiple times before admitting to it. Even after separating, he continued communicating with this person, and had discussed ways to communicate on SnapChat to keep it more private from me. \n\nThese betrayals have been a constant over the years. He\u2019s VERY kind and charming, successful, and a great partner in many ways\u2014but this pattern of dishonesty and boundary-crossing deeply hurts me. He\u2019s now in therapy (week 4), but his efforts to address these issues have historically been reactive and short-lived.\n\nI love him and want to make this work, but I feel judged by those around me for staying. Worse, I live with a persistent anxiety that he\u2019ll betray my trust again. Likely, there are situations I have not yet caught him in, that he continues to hide from me, leaving me in a total mind fck about what\u2019s actually happening behind my back. I stay up overnight stressing about this, but keeping it to myself to avoid any drama - neither of us need more of that in our lives. \n\nI don\u2019t want to leave our relationship, but I also don\u2019t know how to move forward without sacrificing my own mental health. I don\u2019t feel comfortable in my own skin, knowing that he\u2019s continued to show me that he will betray me to protect relationships with unknown guys (who are often 15-20+ years younger than me.)\n\nAITAH to myself for trying to save this marriage, even though the past shows he\u2019s unlikely to change? How do I find a way forward without setting myself up for more pain?\n\nOr AITAH to him, for not being understanding of how difficult it can be to tell the truth in difficult conversations? I want to love and support him, and I\u2019ve tried to grow into a place where I can give him lots of freedom. But I have a couple of boundaries too, and I don\u2019t feel like agreeing to them, and then ignoring them, is a fair situation yo put our fragile relationship in. \n\nAny help is great fully appreciably. Note, I am ALSO working on this with my own therapist. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "AITA for not wanting to help my mom with half of her rent? (TW: SA) (TW: Self Harm)\n\nI am a 23-year-old female, and I recently had to move back home due to a breakup with my ex. However, the reason I moved out in the first place in 2021 was because my stepdad had sexually assaulted me for years. I always tried to tell my mom about it, but whenever I did, she would scream at me and make me feel scared. So, I kept it to myself from the age of 9 until I was 20.\n\nI never really had a door that could lock\u2014either the lock would be broken, or my door would be removed entirely. I had to block my door with furniture, stay up all night, or have my two younger siblings sleep with me, but that never stopped him. My mom mostly worked overnight jobs, so I got little to no sleep and was always in survival mode.\n\nWhen I was 19, I met my now ex-boyfriend. Because he needed financial help and his family had abandoned him, he ended up moving in with me and my family. For the first time, I finally felt safe\u2014I could breathe, I could sleep, and everything felt okay. I told him about my SA, and we came up with a plan to move out. However, my entire family was against it, and my mental health started to decline. I became really depressed and started self-harming.\n\nA year later, my ex found a great job opportunity that required him to travel out of state. We still planned to move out together, but we kept the details private. Around the same time, my family decided to move to Texas, and we were all going our separate ways. Unfortunately, as soon as my ex left for work, my mom\u2019s husband assaulted me again. This time, I snapped\u2014I screamed, cried, and called my boyfriend. My little brother woke up and heard everything, then told my mom. That\u2019s when I finally told her everything.\n\nAs the days passed, I quickly realized my mom wasn\u2019t going to leave him, no matter how much I begged her to. My ex offered me a place to stay with his aunt for the time being, but I was uncomfortable with that because his family had abandoned him. On top of that, my mom kept pressuring me to keep everything a secret. So, I decided to move in with my grandma in Massachusetts while my family moved to Texas.\n\nEventually, I moved back to Florida to live with my ex, but we later decided to go our separate ways. My mom then convinced me to try living in Texas, promising to support me while I got my life together.\n\nFast forward to now\u2014she has finally decided to divorce her husband, but now she expects me to help her pay rent, assuming I wanted to live with her and put my life on hold. That\u2019s not fair, because she chose her husband over me. I tell her this all the time, but she gaslights me into thinking she didn\u2019t. I love my mom, but I can\u2019t sit around and wait for her to find the next guy to put first while I put my life on pause.",

I digress, the voicemail says \u201c Hi, (my husband) this is (we will call her Gemma) I hope you\u2019re doing okay, I\u2019m just checking in because I\u2019ve had a dream about you last night after all these years and I wasn\u2019t too happy about it and it has me a bit worried. I hope you\u2019re good. Uh please... I saw that you got married.. congratulations.. please call or text me back to let me know you\u2019re okay..bye\u201d\n\nI thought this was WEIRD. let me tell you this girl has tried to contact him in the past and he has blocked her off her 300 numbers and she hasn\u2019t bothered us for a while. This is the first time she\u2019s called directly and left a voicemail like that. Wow balsy. We laughed about it because it was bizarre and asked me how I wanted him to proceed and I said up to him. He really didn\u2019t want to make contact butttt I did. I\u2019ve had enough of this desperate woman. So I sent her a text saying: \nHi Gemma,\n\nThis is (my husbands wife), Just reaching out once to ask you to please not be \u2018That\u2019 girl. Calling my husband to tell him that you had a dream about him and that you\u2019re worried for him is not only extremely strange but highly inappropriate\u2014he\u2019s in good hands, I promise. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a nice girl, but respectfully fuck off. \n\n- Mrs.our last name\n\nI feel a little petty but I also don\u2019t because WHY? I don\u2019t know what her intentions were/are but I also don\u2019t care. I would never call a married ex because I had a dream about him? Part of me feels it\u2019s because she just found out we got married even thought we got married over a year ago though we had a traditional ceremony over the summer since our wedding got postponed cause (covid) but just wanted some strangers input AITAH for telling to Fk off instead of just letting it go?",

My mother and father are separated but are on okay terms. They aren\u2019t exactly on good terms but they don\u2019t hate each other. So ever since I moved in with my father because of money issues with my mother she has been a constant nag. Like a controlling boyfriend. Always wanted to know where I\u2019m at and who I\u2019m with and at what time I\u2019m anywhere besides home(which is with my father). Usually I don\u2019t mind it since I relatively don\u2019t go out as much because I\u2019m an introvert. But I got a boyfriend 6 months back and have been actually having a social life since then. Now it feels like my mother is trying to keep me on a leash even tho I don\u2019t live with her. She never wants me out after dark and threatens me every time I\u2019m not home before 5 o\u2019clock on the dot. She also doesn\u2019t want my boyfriend picking me up from college nor me going by him at all. So today I went by my boyfriend(with my father\u2019s permission) and met my mum in front of the house. She told me to tell him go home and for me to come inside. She was very pissed off. I tried to walk off because she started shouting at me. She then slapped me. When I told her to please don\u2019t hit me she got even angrier and tried to do it again. I caught her hand and held it so that she wouldn\u2019t hit me again and my father had to intervene because she started shouting like a cavewoman saying that I was \u2018disrespectful\u2019 for telling her to not touch me.

We have a very long history of partying, and getting in trouble together, where there was one of us- there were two of us. \n\nA few years ago I (27f) had gotten completely sober, met the love of my life, had a baby and really got my life on the right track. \n\nMy friend however (28f) has really hit rock bottom dealing drugs, doing drugs, stealing and has been in and out of jail A LOT in the past 3 years. This past year things started to change as she got out of jail, and started staying away from a really bad group of people we used to hang out with and I was beyond proud of her! So much so that I invited her out to my bachelorette party. \n\n2 weeks ago her mom called me crying, and told me she was hanging out with the bad group again, and drinking heavily- so much so it put her in the hospital. Last week my friend went out of state with a few of the people from that group, got drunk, and was arrested for theft and public intoxication. She didn\u2019t want to tell her current probation officer, so she wouldn\u2019t get in anymore trouble. The people of the group left her in jail, out of state and no way home. \n\nI took it upon myself to call her probation officer and let her know what the situation was, because no one is looking out for her and her family pushes all her wrongdoings under the rug, but I know if she keeps up with this life, she will end up dead and no one seems concerned with that. My friend is now doing 6 months in jail and a rehab/mental health facility (it was between that and prison time as she is now a felon) \n\nAITAH for calling probation on her? No one knows it was me except my fianc\u00e9 and my mother. My fianc\u00e9 was proud of me for making that call, but my mom said I should just stay out of it.",

Again, if wife gets to say dishwasher isnt a christmas gift, then dude should get to say power tools arent either. The point I am trying to make is that it should be fair. Wife cant get showered with fancy clothes, jewelry, tech, etc while husband gets power tools so he can do work around the house. How is that fair? That was my point. But also wife has been asking for a dishwasher for a long time too. So, dont get me a dishwasher for christmas, but still get it for me because i still want a new one. Just not for Christmas because \"thats not a christmas gift\". But here - here's some power tools - so you can do free remodeling work around the house.

I think you guys need to have a discussion about what is considered appropriate gifts, and be fair about it. eg, if you cant get her a dishwasher, then she cant get you tools.

For some context I (23F)(Val) have a Brother(27M) (Raph)who started to see/hangout with this girl I knew from high school she is (22F) let\u2019s call her Mari. My brother (Raph) is very similar to me in the context that we both are very outgoing and like to talk to people, even strangers. I'm taking a nap when he wakes me up to tell me something important, he seems amused to tell me if I knew this girl named Mari as they had met at a coffee shop, apparently, she was talking about a friend name Minjae(22F) and in our town we don\u2019t have many Minjaes. Minjae is a mutual friend of Mari and I; however, we have never gotten along because Mari is jealous/possessive of anyone who tired to be friends with Minjae. I always say what you give is what you get and I had always tried to be kind to her, but let\u2019s be real after a while if someone treats you like crap you start to give that same energy back. Despite all my attempt over the years she has never warmed up to me and that\u2019s fine just respect is all I ask. Back to the story, he told me that he asked her (Mari) \u2018oh does Minjae have a friend named Val?\u2019 She said oh yeah, she does, and she hates me she said. Ralph then asked her why? She said I don\u2019t know. So, he then said Val is my sister. Raph asked why I disliked her so much so Immediately I told him he doesn\u2019t want to go there with her as not only do we have some kind bad blood but because of her possessive nature; every single friend she has ever had according to Minjae has left her/ not wanted to be her friend. I told ralph of other instances where she had been pushy and inconsiderate of people\u2019s feelings, I told him she doesn\u2019t like me, and I truly don\u2019t want you to see/hangout with her but you\u2019re a grown adult and could do as you please. Now I am wanting to tell him to stop seeing her all together again she trets me like crap is this a petty request and being unreasonable?",

            "body": "Hello.\n\nAITAH if i stop cooking my boyfriends dinners and doing his laundry?\n\nBG; been together nearly 6 years. no children together. My house is tiny (12ftx12ft living room and my bedroom, every other room is smaller.) There's literally no space for things to remain on the floor longer than maybe a day if it's a big delivery box we haven't got to yet.\n\nI have constantly asked him to please put his laundry by the bedroom door because I find it difficult and painful to get it from his side of the bed where he leaves it. (I am physically disabled and limited in my movements) He leaves it until it's a pile he has to literally climb over, and then I have up to three loads of just his clothes to wash. He complains when he's running low on work uniform, but doesn't place his clothes where I can get them to the wash.\n\nSince January he has had a job with 12 hour shifts. He's trying to loose weight, and eating after a certain time of night is detrimental to that, so he doesn't eat after 9pm. I don't care really, I eat with my children and his dinner is usually left in the oven and he takes it to eat as lunch the following day. A few times he's not taken it to work and it's sat there going funny so I throw it away. Sometimes he'll only take parts of it and the rest goes in the bin. Sometimes he'll complain it's not big enough, or it's too big. I'm not the best cook, it usually comes from the freezer to the oven and that's what my children know for their whole lives. It's not burnt or otherwise inedible. \n\nHe is a way better cook than I am and cooks on his days off. He says I won't learn to cook better if I don't try to do new things, but I have very fussy ASD children and if I cook something that they don't like the look/smell/taste of they literally will not eat it and I'll have to cook something that they will eat, which is then wasting yet more food. And no, please do not suggest I just make them eat it 'They'll eat it when they're hungry' and all of that nonsense, it doesn't work that way and comments like that just shows you up as being ignorant.\n\nI'm fed up not being listened to and wasting food.",

And yeah, if he doesn't like your cooking then he should just make his own - he's not in a restaurant. Though I don't think that asking for different portion sizes is that unreasonable, though he can portion his own food instead of expecting you to do it",

I relayed all of this to my friend and she accepted. The party happened and I tried to engage online as much as possible to show my love for her. The day after, today I got a text from my friend M that I needed to pitch in for what they spent yesterday for her(R). Everybody decided that all 7 of us would split the costs for the gift basket they bought. I'll be honest I'm kinda broke and the whole bill came out to be a little over 2k rupees so that's 300 or so per person. I'm also a little peeved that they took this decision without my consent, shouldn't I have had a say in this before they bought the gift?\n\nAlso, I live really far from all my friends, about 2 hours away so I can't really hang out with them or go to birthday parties unless it's a college night and I have the college bus taking me home because I have no other means of transport and a 2-hour drive is not easy to make and it's 3 when I'm taking a bus.\n\n(all of that context is important I promise)\n\nWhen I asked M what kind of gift R would like for her birthday she said chip and you know the rest from above but when I expressed guilt over not being able to come and being a little sad from fomo and everything, she said \"aren't you used to it?\" and that hurt me lowkey ngl. I wanna know if I'm valid for being hurt over this or is that comment justified ? I've explained time and time again my situation but every time there's an event or a hangout session I cant go to I find myself getting farther and farther away from these people I call friends. please give me some advice",

            "body": "am i the asshole for resenting my mom? i dont use reddit often, if at all, i just wanted some perspective on my situation. my parents divorced when i was young (currently 15nb) and they were able to come up with a custody agreement without court involvement. during the school year i spend the weekdays with my mom and the weekends with my dad. due to there being no official court agreement, im able to freely switch between their houses pretty freely. this is relevant because i have noticed that i prefer to stay at my dads house and spend go there whenever possible. recently, i have begun to unpack some big feelings concerning my mom. over the years, i feel like she has kind of disregarded me. this march for my birthday, she asked me what i wanted a week before i turned fifteen. i dont want to seem ungrateful for what i did receive but it really made me realize how little she knows me. she bought me a t-shirt from amazon (that i did ask for) regarding this tv show we watch together sometimes (one of the few times we spend time together) and she also put together something the night of my birthday. i thought it was sweet but it also kind of hurt because it felt like she just waited last minute and didn't really know about my interests outside of the show mentioned previously. i might just be dramatic but it upset me to realize little she's actually involved in my life and interests despite her having more time to spend with me during the school year. i just wanted to stay home and hangout with her but we ended up going to target and kind of just spending the night out. i ended up just wandering off and started crying a bit. i just felt really underappreciated as opposed to when i celebrated my birthday with my dad. i dont really like to make a big deal out of my birthday because in previous years stuff has always happened (usually related to my mom or other events that mess up the day, just my luck lol) but my dad and stepmom got me a few shirts as well as a couple stuffed animals and seriously i could cry because i just felt so appreciated because they actually paid attention to what i like. i dont mean to put my mom down but she never asks about me or school and doesn't really call me when im at my dads house. there have also been times in the past where she has just not really showed up as a parent (my therapist recommended that i get tested for ADHD and autism in december of 2023 and she still hasnt scheduled the appointment as of late august 2024. i dont know what the process is of scheduling an appointment or whatever so i didnt feel comfortable as including this as a main point. again this really isnt about slandering my mom i really just want to figure out how i feel.) in addition, my mom's house is currently infested by flies and it took her literal weeks to take action against it. i have been bitten more by flies this summer than i have been bitten by mosquitoes. (if youve never been bitten by a fly, consider yourself lucky lol) im currently in therapy but im afraid to speak up about some mental health concerns i have regarding myself because i have a few memories of her just yelling at me when i was upset as a kid and i feel like my feelings are something i need to push down. ive had a past relationship end because of this so yeah lol. i feel really bad about it but sometimes when im home alone i just break down and wish i was at my dads. i really wish i didnt feel this way but i just want her to pay more attention to me and start putting more effort in. i dont really know what else to include other than the fact that i suspect she was raised by a narcissist as i have found books around the house pertaining to recovering from being raised by a narcissistic parent. im also hesitant to discuss my feelings with her as im tired of facing rejection at her hands.  (TLDR: im unpacking feelings of resentment towards my mom due to a past of her not paying a lot of attention to my interests or feelings as well as failing to schedule testing regarding me potentially being neurodivergent.)",

She had always liked me and I had a crush on her. I was just getting out of a relationship and so was she. We did a lot of things together but never got past 3rd base. Throughout our entire relationship she started showing her true colors, I never knew how narcissistic, arrogant, disrespectful, and unaware of people around her\u2019s feelings she was. Everything started on New Year\u2019s Eve when she invited me to her house to celebrate new years with her family. I always spent it alone and was extremely excited to go. She told me in the middle of the day before the party started that her family cancelled due to a Covid scare but late into the evening (almost 10:30pm) told me that the party was still happening. I was floored, she didn\u2019t tell me ahead of time and didn\u2019t reply to my messages until 1 in the morning, when we had our first biggest argument ever. I told her how I felt like a last minute thought to her and how she knew that this would have been my first ever New Years being surrounded by people and she just kept making excuses and disregarded my feelings. We didn\u2019t speak for a week after that. Fast forward a few months we\u2019ve practically argued every week because when ever I\u2019d bring up an issue she\u2019d feel like it was an attack on her. Whenever I told her to clean her room because it was filthy, she\u2019d say she\u2019d do it and then never did. Whenever there was something she said that hurt me she\u2019d brush it off and I\u2019d try to tell her that it hurt but it would just turn into an argument. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m perfect because there were times when I was the one who misunderstood her but that was like finding a nail in a hay-bail. At some point I stopped saying anything anytime she hurt me or made me feel awful about something. As our relationship continued I started losing trust of her, I\u2019d give her everything and she\u2019d give me nothing. I\u2019d be there for her emotionally, mentally, and even tried to provide her motivation to better herself and take care of herself but when I was in tough situations she\u2019d only say \u201cthat sucks\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d it shattered me every time. Fast forward ing till recently, someone had sent me a message of her and them performing sexual acts towards each other over text. Flirting, teasing, etc. I was at work at the time that it happened so as soon as I got the message I called her and went off like a bomb. She cheated on me, and we\u2019ve spoken about what we both consider cheating. I asked her why she didn\u2019t tell me about it, crickets. I said \u201cI\u2019m done with you I never want to speak to you again.\u201d And blocked her number she tried everything to convince me to get back together with her and for some stupid reason I did. And the following night after working a 13 hour shift I went home and drank a few cans of beer. I got on a call with the same person she did the acts with and after that I blacked out. The next morning I asked the person what happened and they told me everything. So I immediately told her what happened and she broke, I apologized and said I didn\u2019t even remember doing it and that I was sorry. We talked about it and came to a mutual agreement to break up. But for the past month she has been making life a living hell for me and I tried to have a conversation with her multiple times, she wouldn\u2019t answer my calls or texts but she also said she wanted me to stay in her life. I would have just left her alone and left our mutual friend groups but she strung me along until today. When she sent me a short message about how she never felt cared for and that she was mad at me. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say or do\u2026\n\nAITAH?",

However, later on, another friend of mine was curious about who I was hanging out with and asked to see what my other friends looked like. In a moment of poor judgment, I decided to share the photos that had been sent to me privately. I thought it would be harmless, but I didn\u2019t consider the potential consequences of sharing such intimate images.\n\nWhen the friend who originally sent me the photos found out, they were understandably furious. They felt betrayed, and it wasn\u2019t long before the situation escalated. In their anger, they decided to retaliate by doxxing me on a website, revealing personal details about my life. It was a scary and overwhelming experience, but I managed to convince them to take it down after a lot of pleading and explaining. Despite this, the damage had already been done, and our friendship was shattered. We\u2019re no longer on speaking terms, and I regret my actions deeply.

I recently found out that my youngest son (26) was molested at the age of 5-6 years old by the older brother (he was 15 at the time) of one of my daughters friends. Context: I was friends with the guy's mother and since our teenage daughters were friends, we would all visit, and spent a lot of time together. The girls would hang out and my sons sometimes hung out upstairs with their brother playing video games.  I am beyond angry and upset that this happened. I talked with my kids every year about body autonomy, dangers of people trying to touch them/hurt them etc.  I am so so devastated that this happened to him. As a victim of childhood abuse, I wanted to protect them from people hurting them in this manner. This has negatively impacted my youngest son in many ways. He struggles with his anxiety, depression and some alcoholism. I am doing my best to emotionally support him and get him the therapy he needs. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations has passed and he can't be criminally charged for the type of abuse he suffered. (Michigan) \n\nThe main issue I am struggling with is this person who molested my son is grown up and now dating a woman with a 5 year old son and they just had a baby together. I feel like she needs to know what kind of a person he is because her son is the same age and he is definitely in danger of also being sexually molested. I also feel like the assailant's Mother (my former friend) should also know, because her grandchildren are in danger.   My son is in agreement regarding telling them but doesn't want to do it himself. \n\nSo my question is? Am I the asshole for telling his mother as well? I am worried that this  will definitely hurt my old friend. As a mother, I feel like I have to  do something to protect that little boy. And at the very minimum, that little boy needs to be interviewed,  evaluated and protected. \n\nI am also at a loss as to how to do this. Letter, in person, anonymous or not?\n\nI really need your advice.",

My daughter lived a stable, chaos free, childhood raised by myself a single mother who beat the odds of a teen mom who had 2 college degrees and owned a home by the time I was 22. She is diagnosed with Bipolar/anxiety and depression and idk if you have Children or not however, you can raise your children and have EVERYTHING, GIVE THEM EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE \"PERFECT\"NORMAL Upbringing and they grow up making their own decisions and living their own life. Her father who was in and out of jail and unable to provide stability,he replaced that with financially overcompensating. Being a single mom, supporting a family solo-- i wasn't able to buy $100 sneakers - nor would I. However, she idealizes him and he can do know wrong - even though he did jail time for the worst possible charge.. I will leave it to you to figure out. So before you place judgement or ASS-UME that her behavior is due to my lack of parenting... Take a few to read through.. it honestly doesn't matter who or what you decide.. I am very much aware that I am not a perfect mom or person however... When it is my time to leave the universe... She will not be proud of her choices and I am almost certain, regret the time missed. I would give EVERYTHING, AND ANYTHING TO HEAR MY MOM'S VOICE,(Died at 30-To hear her voice when I pick up the phone (dad remarried 6 months after mom died) and say I love you one more time (Stepmom died on vacation with my dad during dinner 2022) I can live with myself and what I have accomplished who's AMITAH",

I called his older brother who told me that my husband moved in to a very fancy apartment with his new girlfriend he met at work. I was stunned to say the least I then try reaching my husband demanding some answers. It was then I realized that he cleared our bank account. I was heartbroken but it was just the beginning of what he's done. \n\nSo currently I'm not working because I'm taking care of our son. I've got a note from our landlord stating that we're 2 months behind on rent and if I wouldn't be abel to pay this month's rent we'll be evicted.\n\nI've been crying for two nights in a row. I've applied for financial aid but it takes a huge amount of time for it to get approved. I'm lost for words.

That evening, while I was working late, someone told me that even though there might be personal issues at work and people might not always get along, that she didn\u2019t want me to burn myself out. She says out-of-pocket stuff sometimes, but I was honestly too tired to really focus on it.\n\nAs I was lying in bed about an hour later, it dawned on me, and I googled the dates of the event. There were two options: either that night or the next night. I decided to text my friends to ask when it was and if I might be able to get a refund. (This dingbat was finally realizing they would have reminded me if they wanted me to go and needed me to bow out if it was the following night.) They told me it had been that night, but because I was so obnoxious and rude, they decided they didn\u2019t want me to go with them. They said they would send me my money.\n\nTwo mornings later, I let them know I hadn\u2019t received the money. They said they\u2019d thought about it and decided that since they were the ones who ordered the tickets, I didn\u2019t deserve a refund. They said I should have remembered and asked them beforehand. It really hadn\u2019t dawned on me to ask when we\u2019ve made plans before; we always touch base and remind one another. Apparently, I was supposed to know, even though they didn\u2019t tell me, that I was uninvited.\n\nI feel like I could have either sold the ticket, gotten a refund, or sat by myself. But instead, they kept my ticket and now have told me I\u2019m in the wrong for expecting a refund. AITA for feeling like they stole the ticket from me?",

This past week, i used one of his cc for- a bill, some groceries, a christmas gift for my mom and then a christmas gift for my husband. I used the cc and not the debit because I didnt want him to see where i got his gift and I thought he wouldnt look til after christmas. All in all, it totaled $550. He saw and blew a freaking fit. Screamed at me for 10+ minutes while our little kids heard everything and has given me the silent treatment for 2 days. Some backstory.... he racked up\n40k in cc debt and I had NO IDEA. I just found out this year. I was very forgiving and stayed calm, never got mad. Before having kids, i owned a business and paid for almost everything while he paid for student loan debt. Once we had kids, my parents paid off 70k in student debt, paid cash for our million dollar home and have paid for sooo many other things. Anytime we get in a fight, it is because of money and he throws it in my face that \"he didnt ask for any of this\". Tonight i almost asked him to move out when i was putting our youngest to bed and our 2 toddlers spilled my ruby red squirt all over our cream rug. The oldest came up and said \"dads not helping and is outside\"...came down to the huge mess. Asked my husband why he didnt help he said \"why the fuck should i help you\"",

(There's backstory so read on for full context)\n\nOk so my ex stays with me and has stayed with me for the bulk of 3 plus years since all pretense of our association being anything resembling a romantic relationship ended. It has been a sordid affair and toxic in the extreme. LOTS of underlying resentment on my part for a history of disregard for my personal belongings, which he by all appearances regards to be his personal belongings when they actually are not. But I digress. He and I were talking and he is so nonchalantly flicking his cigarette ashes on my bedroom floor when he knows that I am working constantly to try and keep my apartment clean and should appreciate how much more difficult a task that is when he is living here. And to be fair, I wouldn't trip out about something like that if done absentmindedly and apologetically once I pointed it out. But where I want to lose my shit is when, instead of changing such rude behavior, he chooses to go about creating a defense for his actions by telling me that I needed to sweep the floor anyway. His justification is that he is replacing the runners on my chest of drawers but he  hasn't made so much of a mess that I would otherwise need to sweep a floor I just cleaned this morning. All of that is really irrelevant though because I know that it really doesn't matter what state the floor was in. He would have put the ashes in the floor anyway because that's the way he's always behaved here. As in response to my rage he likes to send all these Facebook videos about understanding ADHD. So am I the asshole for not buying his bullshit? I have empathy for the neurodivergent, I have my own mental foibles. But this reeks of narcissism to me. Thoughts?",

            "body": "Sorry it\u2019s long, and I just downloaded this app to rant about something but am I the ass hole for this. I recently just ended a 10+ year long friendship with my childhood best friend. During most of the friendship in Highschool I was constantly crying because they would ruin relationships with the people I would date, and say comments that would make me self conscious about myself. In all my romantic relationships they would make the person feel bad and call them things like \u201ca piece of shit boyfriend\u201d or \u201casshole\u201d and I would just have to stay quite and never say anything back. They would also say rude comments about my body that hit hard especially because I was struggling with my confidence and felt suicidal at the time. One specific moment I was looking in there mirror and asked if I was and hour glass where they responded with \u201cyeah i guess, Not as much as me though\u201d. They also always put me second place or in the back of their mind when it came to plans and would cancel plans just to hang out with a guy they just met when me and them have made these plans multiple days in advance, and continue to expect me to put them in a higher value position than anyone else in my life including family. They also pressured me to stay in a very toxic relationship where I got cheated on multiple times. They also would never try to make any plans to hang out or never try to talk to me, and would always expect me to apologize for anything that happened between us even if they started it. After I moved away to college and got busy with starting my life we got into a huge argument. The argument started out by me forgetting about going  to an important event for a mutual friend. I am going to clear the air and say it was fully my fault for missing this event because I forgot to put it in my calendar, however, my friend could of reminded me of the event or our mutual friend could of reminded me of the event. Anyways during this argument they blamed me for never talking to them and always wanting to hang out with my boyfriend, when I called them 4 days before to see if they wanted to hang out that weekend. I tried to remind them that I called them that 4 days before and they just wouldn\u2019t accept that. They also got mad at me for simply hanging out with my boyfriend and started texting him calling him a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d when he wasn\u2019t involved at all. My friend would also never take anything seriously when I\u2019ve warned them about the things their partners would say about them behind their back. I was also never able to talk about my problems that I experienced in my life with them because they would glaze over it and make it into a competition over who has a harder life. The second huge argument that happened they blamed me for my poor relationship with my father when they have the same issues with their father. They also got mad at me for talking to my current boyfriend about my current serious mental health issues that I\u2019ve been experiencing (hallucinations) and said that I should \u201cgo see a therapist or better yet talk to her instead of my shitty boyfriend\u201d when I already see a therapist and already explained to them why I\u2019m uncomfortable talking to them about my problems. There are many other things and I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve probably done some things that might have hurt them, however, I feel like I\u2019m the one most hurt. Currently I have ended the friendship and they are acting like it\u2019s all my fault, and telling people what\u2019s going on to the point where there family has started contacting me telling me that I can\u2019t be mad at her, she has her own problems and is off her meds, while I\u2019m unmedicated and suffer from far worse mental health issues. They are currently mad at me and believe that I should apologize however I think they should apologize and I feel very hurt and mad and know I will never get an apology. Am I the ass hole?",

The past few days, she has been off; super defensive, moody, combative, etc. Two days ago she was telling me a story about her taking her boyfriend\u2019s nephew (4) to the barber shop and left him there while she ran errands. I asked her why she did that because in my opinion, 4 is too young to be left alone anyways. My sister then responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable sitting in the barbershop or in my car and I had errands to run\u201d which validated my point even more of why she left this child if she admits to not feeling comfortable herself. She then responded by saying, \u201cthat\u2019s what his mom does & she told me to do it.\u201d I then responded by making the remark, \u201cI know not to let you take my daughter to get her haircut.\u201d My sister blew up.

My son passed recently in a horrible accident (no fault of his own) and although there were over 100 people at his funeral including about 30 from my husbands family and a few of my cousins, not one of my siblings could take the time to come. My parents have passed. \n\nMy brothers (66, 62) both make a lot of money. My sister (68) is retired but is worth several million dollars.  They live 4 hours by plane.  One brother said it was too far from the airport, he'd have to rent a car and drive and did not feel like it. The other said friends were coming to visit from out of town for a week and he and his wife needed to be there.  My sister never even called.  Not a card, not a note. Nothing.  My SIL posted on FB about \"her favorite nephews\" death before I told anyone, how much she loved him and how horrible and sad it is.  Yet she couldn't come to the funeral because friends were coming.  What kind of friends would mind if you were gone for a day? I realized then, I didn't need them anymore.  I (middle child) have always been very accommodating as I lived in some great locations so I was the vacation go-to.

It has helped that my boyfriend (30 M) has had 4 of those days off. I\u2019ve been on the couch and made very little contact with my son. On Sunday, I felt fine when I got up so I took my son to church with me. Turns out I was still sick and I must\u2019ve just had a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nIt\u2019s currently Monday and my boyfriend\u2019s mom texted me to ask for a \u201cplay date\u201d with my son where she comes and hangs out with him once a week while I get other things accomplished. I let her know what I was sick and I would get back to her but possibly Wednesday. Just a few seconds later I hear my boyfriend on the phone\u2026 he gets off and asks me if I\u2019d want his mom to take my son tomorrow so I could rest and not get my son sick. I said \u201csure, sounds like a great idea. I don\u2019t want him to get sick.\u201d\n\nA few hours pass (1 pm-ish) and my son sounds congested and his boogers are running down his face (according to my boyfriend and the sounds of my son breathing). I immediately call our pediatricians and the Nurse Practitioner informs me of signs and symptoms to look out for and if his symptoms do continue that it will be worse on day 3. I\u2019m internally freaking out at the idea of him getting worse because I don\u2019t want him to experience that. However, I\u2019m also aware of the reality that he needs to gain natural immunity.\n\nThe day passes and my boyfriend tells me that his mom is planning on coming at 6 am to pick up my son (I start to panic because how the heck am I going to be able to see whether or not my son is okay if he\u2019s just being shipped off). I proceed to tell him that I just don\u2019t know how comfortable I feel with her taking our sick son and I think he needs to be home with me. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for me to ship off my sick son when if we\u2019re both sick\u2026 he should be home with me.\n\nHe instantly gets frustrated and starts slamming things\u2026 I start to shut down because now I feel like the shitty girlfriend and daughter-in-law for his mom already being in town and canceling on her last minute. We discussed the situation and I admit that it was wrong for me to have taken him to church with me on Sunday (that\u2019s where my son made contact with me) and I came to the resolution that she can take him, but as soon as she notices his symptoms progressing then I want him home.\n\nHis final decision is calling his mom and telling her not to pick up my son.\n\nI\u2019m currently working on my people-pleasing in therapy. I think this situation reflects that a lot. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m capable of making decisions without considering how it affects everyone else and when new situations arise, I don\u2019t always know how to handle them until it\u2019s \u201ctoo late.\u201d\n\nAITAH\u2014mom, girlfriend, and daughter-in-law?

The reason for the break up is he was so tired from work and I reminded him of his ex. His ex was assumingly crazy and wouldn't leave him alone and always had to be by his side. So we broke up bc I was like his ex. I give him loads of space and now we have been secretly dating for 4 weeks\n\n\nI,(F 17) and my bf (M 20) have dated before and it ended bc I was like his ex. A month later he adds me back on snapchat. We say sorry to each other and forget. I have been over-thinking and started to think he was cheating on me with another girl. Don't get me wrong maybe it is just my mind playing tricks on me. First week of us together. We are all happy and I made him a home made gift for christmas, he gives me a hug and a kiss I asked for, but I'd assume he would get me something else for Christmas other than a hug and a kiss, we spent 6 hours together that day. End of the day \"his dad\" called and he stood up instantly and said oh i have to go but it was a ft and not a regular call which is weird bc not long ago I seen want he had his dads' photo was. contact photo wasnt the same. That night he feel asleep and didn't text or call or sleep call. So then I kept thinking about him and texting him but he acted like nothing had gotten thru the next day. Then a week later it was new years eve he promised he would call me to wish me a happy new years day and kiss the phone bc I couldn't go out and be with him for it he didn't and broke his promise and it hurt.  then on Friday 3rd he came over and woke me up bc I didn't realize I fell back asleep waiting for him, so he woke me up and decided that it would be funny to move my blanket to see what I was wearing and I didn't have a bar on and I made it known I didn't want him in my room when it is dirty so I was telling him to wait for me in the living room and he did. Recently this week I've been thinking a lot bc he hasn't been texting me as he used to and only call atleast 3 times this week and the last. it hurts bc it feels like he doesn't want me around as he use to. And the only person that knows about me is his dad and that's is it. my whole family knows who he is which is total bull. It's like he isn't putting the effort I'm putting in to make this relationship last. I'm honestly about to end it bc it feels if I do nothing it will fall apart. Feels kinds like he never wanted It in the first place\n\n\nAm I an A-hole bc I want his attention?\n\n\n\n\nPlease do respond if you can. I need the advice\n\n\nEdit 1 we broke up just at 1 month after he practically ghosted me. We don't talk anymore",

We have a great relationship for the most part and rarely argue about anything serious. His ex has been a constant issue since the beginning of time for me. When we first met and started dating he was newly out of that relationship and I had a feeling that they were still talking. We would fight about it. I never saw messages or anything inappropriate but I had a feeling she was jealous that we were together and she was still lurking on his social media everywhere. It got to the point where he finally admitted that early on yes, they were still talking seeing if anything was there but it wasn\u2019t and he wanted to be with me only. That ship had sailed. I asked him to block her on everything out of respect for me and he did. It\u2019s been years. Maybe 7 years since I\u2019ve seen her name anywhere and I kind of forgot about her altogether. Well fast forward to last week, my partners best friend passed away. His ex gf and his friend were also friends on facebook so when my bf posted a bunch of pics on his wall and a sad post, she liked it and commented on it. I was shocked because I thought she was blocked and I have no idea how long she\u2019s been unblocked. Could have been days, could have been years. He didn\u2019t reply or anything but now I am making myself sick thinking they are talking again. I can\u2019t figure out why he would unblock her now after all this time. I mean they aren\u2019t friends on social media but still I feel like by unblocking her he\u2019s opening up that line of communication. She\u2019s been in a relationship herself for like 8 years or so. I want to say something to him but I also know he\u2019s grieving and I don\u2019t want to bring it up at such a bad time. I want to ask him to block her again but then again is he going to try to talk to her another way? Or maybe he\u2019s not even talking to her at all. I don\u2019t have any doubt he loves me. I just worry that they secretly have feelings still or something. It sucks because just seeing her name brought back all this anxiety and I truly haven\u2019t had a doubt in my mind about him being disloyal to me at any point until I saw that.",

Of course you want to emphasize you not wanting him to contact her on social media anymore and the question of whether or not he's been in contact with her previous to his friend passing needs to come up.  I understand about the frustration and anxiety of seeing her name.  Wait until the dust settles and then have a talk with him without accusations.  Tell him your wishes which are understandable.

I\u2019m going to call her Tatum, which is not her real name.\n\nTatum and I used to be best friends, which we aren\u2019t anymore, we just fell out; no arguments or anything like that. I still call her a close friend because we still talk and know a lot about eachother. Moving on, I had met this guy around 2 years ago. We clicked really fast and well, and we started a \u2018situationship.\u2019 It was in and off until about February- where we just stopped talking. We didn\u2019t talk as much as we would normally, but we did still talk as friends. I failed to mention this because I want to keep it short, but I\u2019ve been in love with him from when we met to this point. Skipping to May, I had confessed my feelings twice, and a month later I would find out that him and his girl bestfriend started dating. (She told me she liked him, I told her I liked him, she said she would back off. This was in May.) I was upset at her, but I soon got over it, because she\u2019s happy. They dated on and off throughout the year until recently, when they broke up. I think I like him again, and I know it\u2019s bad, but that\u2019s not the point. One day, Tatum texted me. She said something along the lines of, \u201ci think i like (him)..\u201d and so obviously I was like oh. Because I forgot to add this, but she knew through the months that I was in love with him. She caught on and was like \u201coh you still have feelings for him?\u201d I responded with something like, \u201cI think, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d and she got mad, because I still like him, and to her she can\u2019t like him because of me. I give her full permission, but I am still weirded out and kind of upset, knowing she knows I\u2019ve liked him. Recently we\u2019ve been talking a lot more, too. I don\u2019t think he would go back to me, but it\u2019s worth a shot. Anyway, I didn\u2019t tell her I was upset, but internally I am; and she probably knows it too. I feel bad, but then again, I\u2019ve been trying to get back with him for, well, around a year. AITA for this?",

            "body": "My sister (f70) was living with her daughter,  who works full-time and didn't have the time to watch after her.  She ended up in the hospital in September '22, from severe nutritional deficits.  After being released from the hospital, she didn't get better.  I picked her up to take her to visit her other daughter (Thanksgiving '22).  During that trip, she couldn't keep any food down.  I kept her at my house, and within a month, she was in the hospital, having her gallbladder removed. \n\nWe had fun in the beginning.   My husband was working, and I let my sister know that on the nights he was working,  she would be responsible for dinner.  That worked, and then my husband died.  Now, I'm having trouble getting her to do ANYTHING. She whines about having to cook.  I take care of everything else.  I pay all the bills.  She doesn't drive, so I schedule and take her to all doctors' appointments. \n\nWhen my husband was alive, I did all the laundry because I didn't ever want to approach the washer/dryer and have her clothes in it.  I have, since he passed, let her know I won't be doing her laundry anymore.  So, now, when I do mine, she'll ask if I have a full load.  When I say no, but it's fine, she'll ask if she can add some to it.  I usually so okay, but she has incontinence issues and brought me wet, wadded up panties the last time.  I'm not going to agree anymore. \n\nTwo days ago, I had gotten up and had a bowl of cereal.   She got up and said she'd been craving French fries, proceeded to make a huge batch, and then asked me if I wanted any.  I said no.  Hours later, I went into the kitchen.  There was oil all over the stove, her leftovers sitting on the island, the utensils for cooking everywhere.  I controlled my anger, cleaned up the mess, and then told her, \"If she's not cooking for me, I don't think I should have to clean up her mess.\"  She cried, and she's barely come out of her room since.  \n\nWe are very different.   I worked for 35 years in a school office, and she's worked outside the home, but very little.  She has two adult daughters. My only child died 9 years ago.  Her husband died 25 years ago from cancer. She spent the next 20 years living with one daughter or the other.  She's not a neat person and says I'm nitpicky...\n\nWhat do I do?  I don't want to reach a point of hating my sister, and although I'm sure she already thinks I'm the AH, I don't want to really become one..",

It had been hitting some pretty abysmal temperatures and I at one point asked, as the Ytwoman, handed me a crotched scarf, if I could get some of the solid weaves, because air just goes right through and doesn't keep the people warm. I could tell she was broody before I even said anything.  Well, aparently, that was enough to speak with the director, and by the way, she is on the board.....other thing is some new yt woman wanted to do some snap benefits and she said she could train me. I was glad to take this on since I am out on the streets and I could do both at once. She also notified the director and said I had made her personal boundaries uncomfortable. He said he needed to speak with her because I questioned what that even meant....he said he didn't know. So, the first thing I am thinking, is why are you bringing something up that doesn't have enough information? Second thing is I realize, these are two Yt women, on the verge of crying their yt tears to a yt man about a brown woman. Am I wrong here? I told the director that coming from my perspective, a brown woman, two YT women acting fragile, and complaining to you makes me very uncomfortable so I am going to withdraw myself from the outreach. He said, okay. That was it. The fact is, I feel like more should be done about this kind of thing. YT women who act like fragile snowflakes, should seriously be asked for their part in their feelings. What I did, which was litterally ask for a different kind of scarf, and what the other person who didn't get into details on what happened, just that I crossed her personal boundaries, is wrong.",

            "body": "AITH for kicking out a customer of a closed store?\n\n  \nI work the closing shift of a national supermarket chain in it's national HQ district. Last night, about 10 minutes after close, a customer walked into the store. First, for clarification, our front doors are disabled at 5 minutes until the time and we have someone watching the door to inform people that they aren't to come in as we are closed. This particular night, however, the person watching the door was a deaf individual, and the intruder took advantage of that fact, whether he knew it or not. When I saw this person enter the store, I promptly made my way to him and asked him to leave, letting him know that we were closed. He started to ask me about some problem he had with missing merchandise, and again I informed him we were closed and that he would have to return tomorrow morning if he wanted to talk to the store about it. That's when he started moving towards the \"re-shops.\" (merchandise that customers have said they didn't want anymore or we found in places it didn't belong) That was unacceptable, and now I was more firm in my tone in telling him that we were closed, and that he was to leave the store now. When he refused, and asked why, I told him that entering the disabled doors after hours was technically breaking and entering, and that he was in violation of the law, so he must leave or I would call the police. He asked again why, even though I had just told him, and that was enough. I turned to another employee and instructed them to call the police. Now the man became indignant, and began yelling whereupon I had had enough and just began repeating \"Leave! Leave! You are now trespassing and have broken into a closed business and need to leave immediately! Get out!\" The man said \"I will remember you!, to which I responded \"Good! So will our security cameras!\"The brand new night manager was finally made aware of the situation and arrived moments after the man left, whereupon I explained the whole situation. I finished my duties and clocked out, and it wasn't until I was on the drive home that the weight of the fact that this man might have been armed gave me enough pause to start the process of me nearly soiling my pants. It also occurs to me that there might have been a different way to handle the situation, but when he started going towards merchandise, after having broken into a closed store and ignoring several attempts to convince him to leave peacefully, I believe I was as peaceful as I could've been. I never made ANY physical contact with him, because that's just a lawsuit waiting to happen in this society. And he was looking for merchandise he had left behind, something I sympathize with, but am not empowered to do anything about, and especially not after the store is closed, where the only people who are supposed to be inside are employees.\n\n  \nSo, AITH for kicking out an intruder?\n\nTL;DR: Man walked through disabled doors into a closed store and I threw him out verbally after the threat of law enforcement when he made a move towards merchandise.",

We had been messaging about the snow fall forecast (as one does when you\u2019re making small talk) and I told him I was sitting on the couch waiting for it to snow. Because I\u2019m like Lorelai Gilmore. He thought this was cute and we got into more deep conversations. After it started snowing I want to bed and when I woke up we continued talking. Well the talking turned s**ual after awhile. \n\nIt was early enough in the day that we continued this kind of flirtation but talked about normal things. I then ended up inviting him over for dinner. But in order to get my location he had to send me a d*** pic. And when he did I was in absolute shock. \n\nIt was huge. we had discussed not having you know the first night. But when he came over we ate dinner, drank wine, took an edible and I ended up feeling comfortable to do so. \n\nNext day I woke up early like I normally do and let him sleep. He left and we said goodbye so everything felt normal. \n\nWell fast forward to today, three days later. I basically asked how he was the evening after he left but he didn\u2019t respond. Then I spent the next two days stewing. Wondering what I did wrong? Did I talk too much? Did he not enjoy it? Etc. etc. \n\nThen I ended up on a rabbit hole tonight. I just simply googled his name and found a court case where he ended up owing 10,000 dollars for doing some type of defamation case. Well read into it because duh\u2026 and apparently he tried to defame a guy who r*p** a model who was into s** model. My jaw dripped again! Who is this dude. Then I found out he was dating one of said models and now she\u2019s an OF model. I went to her channel and just a few months ago he did a video with her and she was pregnant! \n\nThen I went to FB and found his most previous ex and she is also a model in the biz. \n\nI obviously won\u2019t continue going into details. But now I what do I do? He responded tonight saying that he\u2019s been busy because of the snow. But I also don\u2019t know if I want to continue with him if he hasn\u2019t responded and is also possibly involved with her still. \n\nSo am I the asshole if I slept with a criminal and have conflicting feelings?! \ud83e\udee3",

I hate with a passion adults vtubers who act like children.  The creep factor of me is insane and I have so many friends who follow multiple personalities like this.  I don't hate the people themselves, heck I don't even know them.  Just every time I hear them I get reminded of some traumatic stuff in my childhood.  The safest to share being a conversation I was having with my aunt about hygiene and removing hair south of the border.  I was asking her why when my uncle popped in and said \"Because if you want to keep him you need to look young. Younger the better\"  Over my life I've asked other dudes why they prefer it shaved and about half of them go into explaining how it looks more appealing as it reminds them of a child.  These days I really can't see adults doing anything that actually mimics a child without wanting to hurl.  I feel like I'm letting my friends down by not seeing these chibi like characters making adult sounds and finding the humor in it.  Yes I've been in therapy for years.  It's the only reason I don't have a full freak out on it.  \n\nNow the question that I think I may be the ah on.  I keep ghosting my friends when they send me this stuff.  Partially cus I just need a day to chill on some of them.  I really don't know how to explain it to them.  As a person that no one knows on here it's easier to bring up but to people that you actually care about it's intimidating.  So yeah I know I'm a bit of the ah but any ideas how to explain why to them so I get less of that type of stuff shared to me?\n\n  \nIf I posted this in the wrong spot sorry first time posting on here",

We had a big fight the other day to where she said she wanted to break up and told me to go back to my state (I moved 13 hours to be with her) we then just went in separate rooms to chill out. After talking again she told me she didn\u2019t want to break up but still thinks we need some time apart. She then later explained to me the issue with her was that we haven\u2019t had sex in months yet in the beginning of our relationship I told her I\u2019m not a sexual person and she agreed that was fine, later to find out she\u2019s not okay with it I got very upset and feel like I\u2019m being forced now. I\u2019ve also been very depressed lately missing my family and being stuck in the house all the time when before I moved here I was always outside doing something so sex is the last thing on my mind. But anyways to explain things better I\u2019m transgender FTM I have had top surgery but not bottom so I\u2019m very insecure about not having a penis and on top of that since I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve been balding more so I started shaving my hair, I\u2019ve gained weight, and I\u2019ve got more grey hairs so let\u2019s just say I haven\u2019t been very confident lately. I personally don\u2019t think sex is important I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m asexual tbh. She thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable and ridiculous for even getting upset about it but I can\u2019t bring myself to want to do it. She also thinks it\u2019s her that I don\u2019t find attractive even though I told her numerous times it\u2019s literally me not you I still check her out everyday and tell her she\u2019s hot or beautiful.

He used to have a lot of female friends and out of nowhere I would burst into jealousy, and victimize myself saying I wasn't enough and he should leave me, there wasn't a sign in sight that there was more than a friendship on any of the situations whatsoever. I know that came from places of insecurity and I have been working on this over therapy since 2022.\n\nHowever, 2 years ago he met a girl that quickly turned into his best friend, this friendship was normal at the beginning, however the years have passed and the closeness I feel from them makes me very uncomfortable, she calls him her \"brother\" hoewever she posts pictures where they are extremely close, and on his birthday last year, she posted a minute long video where there were several pictures of them together, some in particular where he was sleeping in her arms.  \n  \nThat video hit me in the guts and it was the very reason why I started going to therapy, I have been fairly stable since I've been going to therapy, and was able to find tools that helped me find my place in his life. But there have been a handful of situations where I have felt this girl's presence as annoying to my relationship, for instance there was this time where bf and I were going on a trip 1 week and she told him she \"couldn't survive that week without him.\" (FYI: when were on that same trip she called him and told us in depth how boring her life was without him).   \n  \nBf and I live in different towns so we are only able to see each other over the weekend and this girl just constantly finds a reason to call him up on the only couple of days we spend together. Yesterday, she invited bf and I to her house and we talked for a bit, I personally have the worst fashion choices when I stay at home, but it was a shocker to realize that the woman who my bf spends 90% of the time he is not with me, only wears pijama shorts and a bra around him. I have talked to both of them about the situation with emphasis on how useless I feel after only being able to see him once or twice a week and her being a constant presence in his life. But I always chicken out and end up not asking bf to change anything about this friendship. \n\nI feel bad every time I think about bringing the topic around because everytime I do bf reminds me of the constant nagging  about his female friends when we were younger. And I honestly have burst out once or twice in bad ways about this situation, last year both of them called me crazy for feeling insecure about their relationship and that just felt  even worse. \n\nWhat should I do reddit?",

Now I have severe anxiety and depression, and I started doing drugs freshman year, just weed and nicotine but I\u2019m still addicted to nicotine and I\u2019ve always used it a way to escape from everything.

This can fluctuate greatly depending upon weather but 10 per week is a fair average based on mild weather. Minimum wage for us is around $16/hr. I do not receive benefits, company car, gas reimbursement, bonuses, PTO, am not allowed to call in and do not have a set schedule with myself often working six days a week.\n\nIn the past two years, my family lost our housing and had to move into a very toxic situation. My wife works full time and even two jobs for a while. I have had to get a second job but cannot work enough because I have to work around my family members schedule. My wife and I are going deeper into debt everyday, are unable to keep our bank account out if the negative and we also believe this is negatively impacting our children. They are safe and have food. But the situation is less than ideal. \n\nBasically, I need outsiders opinions. I believe I need to take care of my family first. With a year with full time at my other job my wife and I will be out of debt except student loans and be well on our way to a deposit for buying a house (roughly $15k saved)\n\nAm I wrong? Are they wrong? What if my family member has a health issue and passes or loses their home and business?\n\nAdvice needed.",

We are serious about each other having moved into together after 9 months of being together. We had been staying at each other's places before that so not much of a stretch to move in together.\u00a0\n\n\nSo there was a gender reveal party for his pregnant sister last May and I wasn't invited as his parents don't like me because of something my parents did and has nothing to do with me. His sister doesn't like me bit again she was 17 then now 18 and I don't care if they like me or not. The party was meant to be family only and my boyfriend went but his parent's neighbours were invited and they have a daughter around my boyfriends age. His parents want him to date her instead of me and we fell out that night when I found out. Then we got over that because I got over what happened and we both resolved it.\n\n\nSo flashfoward to now, his sister has had the baby and plans to have a christening and I want my boyfriend to go even if I can't due to his parents and sister still not liking me. It's meant to be family only but my boyfriend told me that the neighbours will be there with the daughter who his parents want him to be with. My boyfriend says he's not going to respect me because he doesn't think of the girl this way.\u00a0\n\n\nI know if he doesn't go then his parents will say I'm controlling him when I'm not because I trust him but I don't trust his parents or sister.\u00a0\n\n\nI just feel conflicted because I know that my boyfriend has shown me time and time he will stand up for me but his parents and sister are trying to get in-between us or that's how I see it.\u00a0\n\n\nSo Reddit, AITAH for this?\u00a0",

I had the day off and took them out whenever they needed it he gets home around five and wants to relax for a bit which was fine I let him relax and decompress well I make supper we eat and we get a little high off some brownies I made a few days ago. I noticed it was getting kinda late and the dog needs to go out I asked him 5 threw out the night till about 1 am wen we finally go to bed I say hey it's been like 7-6 hours u should take them outside to do their business ( it's also a almost everyday thing of us being up till 1-2am). He doesn't and we go to bed said he would do it in the morning. This morning I'm up and my dog has both pissy and shit in her crate and I have been demanding he either give her bath or clean up her crate and said I would do which ever he didn't. He keeps saying not his dog not his problem. Am I the asshole here?",

If he'd pulled this with our dogs, no bullshit, we'd be talking divorce until he was kissing ass and not fucking up anymore!! \n\nThen, I'd call the ASPCA to find out how to file legal charges against him for committing \"Animal Neglect\" multiple times (and actually do it if you're done with him!!!! or simply threaten to do that if he tries that bullshit again!!) \n\nThen, depending on your living status (this is what I'd do if I were in your shoes), I'd either leave and take the dogs with me, or kick his lazy, uncaring, unempathetic ass out and, of course, not allow him to take the dogs!! If he did it again, I'd kick his selfish ass out permanently and call the police, but THEN realize that you should have really learned your lesson way before then and left him!! You can get real jail time in some states now for animal abuse and neglect, which is exactly what was happening there!!! \n\nAnd.... from now on, don't EVER allow him to have full authority of them.

Unfortunately, we were messed around by brokers and ended up needing an additional $10k for the deposit, which I managed to secure. And then asked for additional money to get it across the line approx. 12k\n\nI have been paying about $7k monthly for rent, mortgage repayments (land only at this point) and the extra deposit amount, which completely depletes my monthly Pay. On top of this, I borrowed $10k from my parents, which I plan to repay using my annual bonus.\n\nTo be clear, my wife does cover some of my expenses, such as car registration, car insurance, food, and utilities, though these are relatively minimal from my end, and she did pay for most of the deposit as I was covering rent \u00a0that being said we are at comparable levels of what has been spent.\n\nI\u2019ve asked her to if I could have approximately 14% of my income\u2014about $250 a week\u2014to help cover discretionary spending, such as socializing with friends, items not included in her grocery shops, and other personal or unexpected costs.\n\nWhenever I bring this up, she accuses me of not looking after the family or spending too much on myself, which makes me feel guilty and confused. This reaction feels unfair, especially since I\u2019m already paying for our rental, the new house we\u2019re about to move into, and I\u2019m actively involved in supporting her and her kids.\n\nAdditional context for the situation:\n\n* I earn almost twice as much as she does.\n* She has three teenage children, all with psychological challenges.\n* Their father is still involved and provides minimal child support.\n* She received some money from her previous divorce and work-related settlements, but her expenses have always exceeded her income.\n\nSo AITAH?",

I have a toxic emotionally immature mother... me (42f) with my kids dad for 15 years with 3 kids has always catered to it because of all the guilt trips. My mother literally is the energy of the family, everyone walks on eggshells around her to make sure they're not next in her shit list, minus a couple rogue cousins.... there's always drama and she's the common denominator. I've always had the mind set that I'm the mature one, I can handle it and just not let it get to me.... until my oldest sons bday this summer when my mom started a huge fight and I actually had to ask her to leave... well it wasnt a fight but she was outrageously rude to my husband to the point where I was appalled which historically I've given her a LOT of grace.... anyways... she finally leaves after making a crazy scene (again on my sons bday) later that day my moms sister calls my husband and curses him out, which is fucking nuts because of all the things my husband does for my extended family, home repairs, lending of tools, helping her son move TWICE.... my aunt wasn't there but clearly my mom called her and said my husband was rude to her and got her kicked out and we don't talk for about 2 months because I block her (my aunt too) so I can't be roped back in with manipulation and guilt trips.... she works at my kids school, so I do see her and at first she refuses eye contact and all that jazz and I remain polite... encouraging the kids to go hug nana and say hi and all that....over fall we are becoming more surface level polite and start texting again... come thanksgiving we join the family and things are OFF... my whole family (minus my cousins and my bitch aunts husband) and so cold to my husband. It's obvious they got one side of a story and are treating him horribly, even though I was the one who hurt my mom's pride and kicked her out, not him. So we decide to stay home for Christmas I tell my mom 2 weeks ago so she can process it.. her response is \"well that's just great... by the way your step dad has cancer and we've known since June but was waiting until Christmas to say anything\" (mmm... ok?) so I say you guys are more than welcome to join us and my mom says \"I'm never stepping foot in your house again since your husband shoved me\" I say \"I'm going to stop you right there, before you say something you can't come back from... not only do we both know that's a lie but my back yard had cameras (we were in the back yard at the time of my sons bday) and she doubles down... I say your lying and I'm not even going to entertain that because I was there and I have eyes and know what happened\" we hang up and I cal my step dad to talk to him about the cancer.. which actually turns out to be true.... and eventually I tell him we're staying home for Christmas but they can come over and then I say I'm actually reluctant now because mom is telling people my husband shoved her and he confirms she's been saying this and that it's a lie and has asked her to stop. Which pisses me off more... anyways it's Christmas Eve and I'm riddled with anxiety because she's turned my whole family against me over a lie and even if they believe it NONE of them have reached out to see if I'm ok from my \"abusive\" husband which leads me to believe they know it's a lie and are letting her get away with it anyways... I'm just broken hearted.. so knew my mom was difficult but this is a level of crazy I didn't think she was capable of. I haven't reached out to family to talk about this and no one has reached out to me so it's just a lot. And I'm feeling like do I even call her and my stepdad tomorrow to wish them a merry Christmas or what???",

            "body": "hi, so this is very fucking difficult for me to type out so please ignore any spelling mistakes I\u2019m nervous asf. \n\nSo I am the oldest of three siblings. I have a little brother let\u2019s call him sam he\u2019s 16 at the time of this incident and a little sister let\u2019s call her Lilly she\u2019s 12 at the time. \n\nI was placed in the foster care system when I was 14 (Sam 12 Lilly 8) and I hardly had any contact with my family apart from special occasions until I was 18. \n\nI reconnected with my siblings and found out that they were both also put in care but no one would tell me why. I was in care due to being physically abused by my father. so I assumed the same thing happened to them. \n\nJune of last year an old family friend reached out to me and we were talking about how our lives have been ext and he mentioned how close he was with Sam until recently so I asked if he knew why he was placed in care. \nHe told me that Sam got Lilly pregnant. I was so fucking angry, disgusted and physics sick! They are full siblings. She was fucking twelve and he was 16!!! So as you can imagine I was fucking fuming. \n\nI messaged Lilly and asked if it was true she proceeds to send me pictures of her child. my body went numb I didn\u2019t say another word I saved the pictures and called Sam\u2026 \u201chi Sam.. how\u2019s your kid?\u201d I asked trying to hide my frustration \u201cwhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Was his response. I let him have it I called him every name under the sun the thought of it made me throw up again he hung up and blocked me on everything. \n\nMy brother was always super fucking weird but I didn\u2019t know it was this bad\u2026 Lilly told me that I walked in on them when I was younger and the memories flooded back. I remembered exactly what I saw my dad was working so he left me in charge of this kids I must have been 12 or so at this time. Making Lilly 6 and Sam 10 or 11. \nI remember walking into my dads room and finding them both laying in bed Lilly looked red in the face and I could see her bare shoulders sam was getting off of her as I walked in. I assumed they were fighting as always but decided to call beca into the bedroom we shared. I sat her down and asked her what Sam was doing she was just crying saying that she didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble I recorded this conversation to send it to my dad I did this a lot to show dad how they were behaving while he wasn\u2019t home like if I told them to go to bed and they wouldn\u2019t ext. Well I didn\u2019t end up sending him the video I must have forgotten. I didn\u2019t mention anything to do with what I saw. \n\nI found that video in my google photos and it broke me. There was an ongoing investigation into what was going on with them so I decided to get intouched with the private investigator write a statement and give her the video. \n\nWhen the video was shown in court my mother saw and called me drunk out of her mind. She told me that this entire situation was my fault for not telling an adult. She accused me of watching what was going on and liking it. She disowned me told me that I am a lowlife scum and she never wants to talk to me again. \n\nI was twelve and didn\u2019t know what exactly I was seeing? So Am I in the wrong for not telling my dad what I saw? Is this my fault?",

My mother has always hated to lose weight and look slimmer and look younger. Not I am against this not my problem.  She has been making progress but as all weight loss journey's go my mom has been feeling the urge to eat more due to heavy calorie restriction. Cut to the present, I was in the kitchen doing my math homework when my Mom pulled a scale and weighed herself. she wasn't happy with the result then ask me to weigh myself on the scale. She knows I am insecure about my appearance and often says contradicting things, for example one day she will give this motivational speech about not caring about what others think and love myself etc then later she'll comment or joke about my weight. I don't find it funny at all but can't say anything as I live in a African household where most times when I try to voice my opinion I get written of as disrecpectful and my aunts always says things like \" Oh you think you that girl now, right you think your all grown up cause your 14 right?\" and whenever I try to tell her its not like that she tells me that\" you don't always have to reply or argue back just listen\" but how does she want me to listen to her and hear her side perspective when she doesn't care about mine?   Anyways after my Mom saw her results and wasn't too happy about it she says \" come and climb the scale\" saying something along the lines of seeing who she can 'put down' to make herself feel better.   I climb the scale I am not happy at all and it shows she tells me to 'lighten up' and smile. I climb on it and I am an overweight teen and I am working on my health but I focus more and school and plan to focus more on working on myself for summer break. I have never been in a good mentally head space since middle school bullying. on multiple occasions my counselors recommended getting me a therapist, but when we get home she asks me why should go to a therapist? that it's a waste of money.  These incidents have put me in an even darker head space, I began to force myself to throw up the food I ate, stole some slimming pills and self harmed. I am the eldest so I have no one else to talk to so I just kept these feelings bottle but today she did it again. I tried to calmly tell her to stop but she got all upset and said \" did you just tell me to stop? would you say that to your father? you always do this but when you need help I'm the one who helps you.\" My mom isn't bad we just don't see eye to eye on some topics like my fashion style, choice of music, personality etc. My Aunt can be dramatic somethings so she just blows the whole thing out if porportion saying that \" Leave her alone she thinks she big now, This is her ways of rebeling\" I wanted to snap at her but this was my stepmom's sister and starting out my stepmom and I never had a good relationship and it was mainly my fault so I try to rekindle the relationship but I always seem do f\\*ck up everytime.\n\nAm I the A\\*\\*hole? I am being unreasonable because I really don't know what to do please someone give me advice.  Sorry for the long post I just wanted to so give some context.",

My boyfriend is oversees on deployment and living with 2 other soldiers. One of his roomates is a legit AH and wants everything his way so they needed to have solid boundaries and rules for things so nobody would get annoyed. They are 8hours ahead of my time zone and whenever me and my bf wanted to call otp or ft his roomate would already have turned out the lights which meant he couldn\u2019t talk otp bc they call it \u201cquiet hours\u201d problem is this roomate would turn the lights out at 7pm, 6pm, sometimes even 5pm their time which meant my boyfriend would have to go sit outside in the cold if he wanted to talk to me. They agreed on 8pm eventually which gave me and my boyfriend at least half an hour to an hour of phone time. However as of the past few weeks his roomate has started shutting the lights out earlier and earlier. I told my boyfriend to tell his roomate to follow the rules they had set and my boyfriend said he didn\u2019t want to cause problems. He continued letting his roomate disrespect the rules they came up with and I\u2019ve been getting more and more annoyed that in order to be otp with my boyfriend, I have to inconvenience him. I believe he should be able to enjoy time otp with me from the comfort of his own space considering the rule they created was agreed upon by both parties. However I\u2019ve been fed up with not being able to talk while otp or even call sometimes because of his roomate. I told my boyfriend if he allows his roomate to keep overstepping the boundary they set up, then he is allowing himself to be a pushover. So AITAH?",

No idea how to fix it unless you can literally go confront the roommate.

Not suicidal, but \"cleansing the universe and rebooting it\" phrasing. Made me want to call my cousin's parole officer to give them a heads up, but family and friends urged me to leave it alone. I know I am not responsible for managing my cousin's emotional needs, but finally blocking them from calling and texting makes me feel like I have abandoned them in a great time of need - and the eternal \"if you can't count on family, who can you count on?\" guilt.

            "body": "AITAH For spanking my cousins kid after she ignored her sons behavior\n\nI live in an apartment complex and my aunt & cousin live two floors above. My aunt is always inviting me over to her house since she\u2019s always \u201calone\u201d and she knows I\u2019m always home alone as well. I quote alone because my cousin is always home however she is always inside her room never acknowledging my aunt. Now my cousins children however are always outside in the living room with my aunt. About 1yr ago the older child (6yr old) has been out of control. He starts doing tantrums where he hits my aunt, he takes away her stuff whether it\u2019s her phone or her food that she\u2019s eating or her water that she\u2019s drinking and starts throwing everything and anything on the floor. My aunt has repeatedly told my cousin to control/punish him and all she does is scream at him from her room to stop. Her son never listens and continues to act out. Again this has been going on for a year, my cousin not caring for her children has been happening for over a year. I can see how tired and stress my aunt is by all this. One day while we where eating the child started doing those tantrums again but this time he started hitting the 2yr old baby for no reason. My aunt tried to control him but couldn\u2019t so she called my cousin to come out her room to stop him. Seeing how my cousin was doing nothing but just screamed at him from her room to stop I decided to get up and spank him on his hands. As soon as I spanked him he went running to tell his mom I had hit him. She then closed her room door and started texting me talking about this not your house you don\u2019t like it then you can just leave. I explained to her that if she didn\u2019t like that I spank her kid then she should come out and care for him herself. She didn\u2019t seem to have understand anything because fast forward 5 months to me now having my daughter with me and her son is still doing the same tantrums again but this time he takes away my child\u2019s toy because he got mad that my aunt didn\u2019t have candy that he demanded he have at that very moment. I again spank the child and again she text me all this mean things and basically her acting like she wants to take it outside. This time I walked into her room and said sorry very kindly followed by why can\u2019t she take care of her son why doesn\u2019t she feel the need to help her mom out is it cuz he reminds her of the bby ddy. She got mad but chose to say nothing so I left. I still go over but I feel she keeps getting mad every time I am making sure her child doesn\u2019t touch my child. I started to question AITAH for spanking her kid and not understanding her reason as to why she just doesn\u2019t care for them even though I tried asking her why.",

            "body": "AITAH for wanting to break up with my long-distance boyfriend of over a year because he doesn't spend time with me anymore?\n\nSkip to the third paragraph if you want to skip the background info.\n\nthis is my first time using Reddit for advice but I stooped low so why not? As said in the title, I (18F) and my bf (18M) have been together for over a year. Originally, I did have feelings for him but wanted to move on because he was rejecting me (because he knew I liked him), so I was with another person long-distance for 2 months before our relationship started. While my other relationship was ending, my now LDBF would call me every day, asking to hang out or do something together, so obviously I got love-bombed and gave up my 2-month relationship (I know it's horrible) for my now LDBF. In the beginning, you have that honeymoon stage where a couple months into the relationship, everything is sunshine and rainbows because you want to be together 24/7. Time skip, when my LDBF got his job, I was super supportive and understood it would mean we both would become busy with our own lives, but we still had each other at least.\n\nWe both had a conversation a long time ago about our love languages and how his was physical touch and mine was communication, (were horrible matches so we almost broke up over how difficult it would be) but we wanted to work things and see it through, so I thought things could work out. I guess I never mentioned how I would have my expectations so high and I would want to spend time with him almost as much as we used to, though. Starting the new year, we already had less and less contact because he was working, going to the gym, and going out with his friends. We kept our nightly calls going, but I was a little lonely even with a job of my own, so I mentioned it to him. I don't know if he understood me or not, but he was spending time online more, except with other people (at some point he ditched me for a group of friends including his ex-crush. I complained to him about this and he immediately understood and apologized, blocking her in the process). We spent some of Valentine's Day together and he drove 10 hours with his mom to go Prom with me. One of the most memorable and happiest moments of my life.\n\nAfter that is when he started talking to me less and less which I would always mention and he would counter with \"You're always mad\" \"I never do anything right\" \"I'll just stop going online\" and such self-victimizing quotes. I was always just expressing my feelings and thoughts on how distant he was being which became infuriating over time.  After every argument over this, he would try to \"do better\" for a couple of days, and then revert to this again. I'm on good terms with his mom, so I talked to her about this (girl-to-girl talk), but she only mentioned how her and her husband were the same, that they barely conversate, even in person.  He only called during our night calls, when he would be too grumpy (because he was tired) to have a conversation without it turning into an argument. He wouldn't ask for me or send a single message throughout the day, but he would send our routine good morning snaps. I get that he has other friends and that I'm not his best friend, but after work, he would spend his whole afternoon with someone else.\n\nI eventually always ended up spending time watching shows by myself or spending time with other people, which became lonely. It felt like I was single all over again and we were just two strangers. I would cry over the fact that I missed spending time enjoying each other's company so much, until I realized, this wasn't how I wanted to spend the rest of my life with my partner. Now, I've been mentioning to him a lot about how I wanted to break up with him over this. which gave him a scare. Tonight, I talked with his mom about this again over the phone with him present, and she mentioned the same thing about how 'that's marriage' and laughed it off. When it got back to just talking to him, I exploded on him about how he should just break up with me if he would never willingly want to ask me to play a video game he plays with everyone else but me without me having to ask. I told him that I wouldn't be begging for him to do the bare minimum over and over again. After I was done with my rant, I waited a moment for him to say something and then gave up and said good night. He ended the call with silence, a good night, and then went back to playing. I don't know what goes on in his mind when I argue with him and as much as I try to, including the fact that he can have ADHD, my patience is to a limit. I am open-minded to advice and criticism, but my goal isn't if I'm right or wrong.\n\nSorry for the wall of text",

The term for this is \"being a chickenshit.\"\n\nHe wants out. But he also wants the sympathy of his mother and his friends for being the one who was dumped, and to avoid having to explain why *he* broke up with *you*.\n\nDon\u2019t give him what he wants. Just ghost him. Don\u2019t block him, but ignore and delete his messages and calls. Mute him on social media. If his mother gets in touch with you, tell her what I told you above. It\u2019s not clear how many friends you have in common, but if they ask, tell them the same. Say it calmly, matter-of-factly, and change the subject. If anyone presses you further, just say \"we drifted apart\" with a shrug.\n\nYour closure is the realization that he was trying to manipulate you into an outcome where he gets to look like the victim, and you didn\u2019t let him do it. His closure: Not your problem.\n\nSo, no; you're NTAH. He is. And if you just refuse to engage with him at all from this point on, that *still* doesn't make you TAH.",

I at the time 12 F was recovering from my father\u2018s harassment towards me, he thought it was simple play but i saw it as harassment as i told him to stop for ages. He did this ever since i was a toddler up to 11 years old. He finally stopped after i yelled at him over text for calling me during obvious school hours. The rant went on from him and to sum it up, it was just saying \u201ci ignored your begs for me to stop because i miss my oldest daughter and you\u2019re a punching bag for my mental sickness\u201d I obviously was not happy with his stupid excuse as he is fully capable of restraining his disgusting urges of spanking me Every time i bent down to do something or just walked by him. He said \u201ci thought it was just play and not some traumatic thing\u201d and denied when i said that it\u2019s sexual harassment. He eventually did stop after that heinous battle. But i was still hurt and wanted nothing to do with him, of course.. that\u2019s not something possible for a sociopathic person. He made it his mission to believe i hate him because he\u2019s not around. (NEWSFLASH) i\u2019m happier when he isnt around. But this time that he came to our place for work, he really got on my nerves. I am very hot headed, but i\u2019m able to control it, but when people don't let me speak i lose it. I also have a grudge against a cat i have for another reason. He happened to like that cat and stated he likes it. I said i dont in a neutral tone and he took that to offense. He said \u201cit\u2019s the nicest cat you have\u201d i disagreed. I stated why and that it reminds me of what he did and i said again how it was harassment and i had also overheard that he wanted to force me to come to his place which i do not like. He denied it even though i heard it with my own ears. And he kept interrupting me and not letting me speak. I was very aggravated by this and words slipped out of my mouth. He started stating all the things he\u2019s done for me which all are for video games and do not benefit me at all. I left the room because i was so tired of his horizontally tall self. And as i walk out of the room i hear him say explicit words in a sentence. i was so fed up i started crying. I stated what he said to me to my mother and she was pissed off. My dad thought i was in the wrong for insulting him by calling him mentally challenged and claimed he had authority over me because i\u2019m his. (Btw he called me his little doll a year back which still makes me shiver to this day) he said he apologized months ago and i need to forgive him, but it\u2019s not easy to forgive someone after years of the same harassment. My mom thinks i should forgive him but i cant think of ever forgiving him right now.",

I 15M had a friend of my ex who well care \u201credhead\u201d now \u201credhead\u201d was sweet to me when my girl pushed me away telling me to \u201cgo to class\u201d when I wanted to be with her, keep in mind my ex never had a reason to push me away; she just did it because why not? So me and \u201credhead\u201d decided to hang out at Starbucks and walk across the street to chill out in front of the school with each other. I noticed some signs prior to my last day of middle school: she shared hot Cheetos with me but fed them to me as I played games on my phone no matter how much I tried to reach for one. And when we were next to eachother in the hallway I was distressed because I was leaving behind all of my 7th and 6th grade friends who I was scared were gonna take a downfall after I\u2019ve left. In the midst of my episode she reaches for my chin to look at her which I assumed was her trying to comfort me. Fast forward back to the front of the school we have our Starbucks and I made the bold move to lay on her lap assuming it was just me being close to somebody. It felt like just having a sister who would never leave your side\u2026 fast forward me and my mom drop her off at her home and unfortunately this\u2019ll be the last time I physically see her. We text and chat with each other until one night we\u2019re staying up late and she lets her feelings slip to me, which is when I realized I lost feelings after some of the stuff my ex put me through. So because \u201credhead\u201d gave me the validation I wanted, I decided to be in a relationship behind my ex\u2019s back. Me and \u201credhead\u201d broke up because she felt it was wrong we were dating behind somebody\u2019s back but I spoke to her over the phone. So tell me, am I the asshole for making that kind of call?",

            "body": "AITAH? \nI (24F) and my now ex-bestfriend (23F) I will call her, (EXBESTF) had been best friends since the 3rd grade and have been through life together. \nI had ended our long 15+ year friendship due to things she had done and said while I invited her and her husband to stay with me and my ex-boyfriend calling him (EXBF) for a weekend for a beach trip last year in June. \nDuring the weekend, we decided to go out and do things because I wanted to show them around town. \n\nIncident 1. My EXBESTF was being dramatic as she usually was, because that is just the person she is about anything and everything. At first it was all going fine and normal, then while her and I were getting ready to go out, she asked to borrow one of my jackets because it was a little chilly that night. I didn't mind it at all and gave a jacket to her, then she walked out of the room and sat in the living area and waited for me to finish getting ready. My EXBF came into the room to talk to me for a minute after she walked out, then he walked out of the room. My EXBESTF comes back into the room angry and pissed off and said. \"Your boyfriend looked at me funny, and I feel judged, and we are gonna have a problem if he has something to say to me, he can say it. I look fine and there is nothing wrong with my outfit!\" (For the record I didnt think anything was wrong with her outfit)And I was confused, because my EXBF never looked at girls that way I knew that for a fact, but of course I didn't believe her because I thought she was being her dramatic self, but this time, it was like amped to 100, and I asked to talk to him about it after she left to wait in the living room. He told me he didn't look at her that way, and he just noticed she was wearing my jacket, but he wasn't checking her out. I let it go and moved on. \n\nIncident 2. We go out to a restaurant and go out, after that we go to a bowling alley. When we arrived at the bowling alley, I went to the restroom and she follows me. She stopped me on the way and said. \"Look do we need to talk about something? Because we can talk about it now.\" And I responded, everything is fine, I'm not upset, he told me he just noticed you in my jacket and that's why he looked at you, but he wasn't judging you.\" Then she just was like \"ok, if we need to talk about anything else let me know.\" And she went back. \n\nIncident 3. While at the bowling alley, we had a table to sit and were playing the bowling game, and I had gone to the restroom again, and when I left, it was just my EXBESTF and my EXBF at the table. Note when it was the three of us, it was fine and we were just talking, my EXBESTF's husband was playing his turn. While walking away, I noticed my EXBEST and my EXBF talking, and I wasn't bothered in the slightest because I trusted them. I come back to the table and my EXBF looked uncomfortable. Shortly after, we leave to go back to my apartment. I texted my EXBF while sitting in the car and asked him what was wrong and if he was ok, he texts me back that my EXBESTF told him some things that weren't true that made him very uncomfortable. I was very upset about it and told him when we got back, \"if you need to know if something is true or not, come to me, because she lied about what she had said.\"\n\nConclusion: After the trip, her and I had talked on the phone and I told her I simply needed some space, and I wasn't angry I was just more confused about her behavior and was questioning whether or not if this was the point to end our friendship, because she had never ever acted like that before with anyone I had been with. This was the 3rd person I had been with. \nShe reached out over text and said \"Alright, Im not going to chase you down anymore girl. It\u2019s exhausting and only damaging to my mental state and it\u2019s strained enough. So if you want to continue being friends or whatever we can call it, which I hope you do but again I can\u2019t force you to have a friendship with someone you don\u2019t want to have. So like I said I\u2019m sorry for any pain or problems I\u2019ve caused and I\u2019m just done holding on if you\u2019ve let go. I still care for you dearly and hope we can still have a friendship but if you don\u2019t feel the same just let me know.\" \n\nI responded with: \"Ok, I understand. Honestly, I don't think we should. I have enjoyed our time growing up, but we have grown apart more than anything and we no longer see many things, I can always respect you and love you, but I believe it's for the best we don't proceed to hang out. I have forgiven you.  I love you, I just have changed a lot like you have and that's ok.\"\n\nAITAH for ending our friendship?",

He lost 17kg in 6 months, couldnt eat without vomiting and couldn't stop crying as well as being extremely lethargic. I had alot of time off work to help him thru many doctors and a week long hospital visit to figure this out.\n\nFast forward to a month ago, when his injection medication in his belly, that I  had to administer once a week for a year, stopped working. He slid down hill so quickly, that once again, we had a hospital visit, drips of steroids and fluids, waiting for \"Government Approval\" on the new medication he needs, and again - alot of time off work.\n\nMy boss at the time a year ago told everyone I work with - \"I don't know why she needs to stay home with him while he's sick? He's old enough to take care of himself!\" - I heard this from many different people, but let it slide. NOW a year on, I am having to leave work early every day to take care my son. Again new medication, steroids and hot weather is playing a toll on him. Due to this, he has not been back to school for the last 5 weeks (last term of the school year) so when I feel he can go, I tell him to try, and if he can't make it thru the day, call me - i don't want him to fail this year and have to repeat it next year, on top of everything else he is going thru. I told my boss this when I got to work today and she said... \"you're a mean mum! You should have let him stay home alone!\". I blanked for that conversation and again let it slide so I didn't burst into tears. 1 hr later I get the call to pick him up and all my co-workers rolled their eyes at me as I left.\n\nI am literally broken down because I can't fix my son so he feels better. My husband is self employed and hasn't been paid in a month because of the building industry sucking. I haven't worked in a month so I can be there to help my son. The bills are piling up and all I want to do is quit! Lay in bed for a month! Cry and not talk to anyone ever again! I have no family support and I am the one in our little family of 3 who fixes all our problems. I have told my boss this many times this last year but now I feel like she uses it as a gossip tool so she can look better as a boss (saying things to staff members - i know we're under staffed but (ME) had to leave again!) rather than understanding and having my back.\n\nAlso I work in Childcare and our job is to work with families and be understanding in their stressful times in life, so that's why I can't believe this is happening.",

My grandparents are huge burdens, and for the past six months my grandfather has been in and out of the hospital. He's stated that he's done and just wants to die, but my mother keeps trying to keep him alive. I just think it's cruel. He's tired and sick, just let him go. Meanwhile, my grandmother has Alzheimer's and doesn't appreciate my mother either. I need my mother in my life, but she's working herself to death keeping these people who don't want to be alive anymore to live. Also, the assisted living place we moved them to doesn't lift a finger to help them. We moved them there so my mom could finally relax, but now she's working double-time while they just stand there and say, \"We can't, that's an extra charge\". This place lied to us about charging extra. They promised that everything would be taken care of, but they lied. Now, they're putting both of them on hospice, which again, costs extra. I honestly wish that assisted suicide was more accepted in our world and that we could talk about it openly. We put our pets down when they're too old, why don't we do that for people?",

Before we did this, I asked if it was okay if we could split the gas and parking because I felt like we were sharing the car itself and there was nothing wrong with asking to split a bill for something we are sharing. I was met with heavy backlash from my friends. One of them (let\u2019s call him darren) lecturing me and saying that\u2019s not what \u2018friends\u2019 do. Fast forward when we arrive at the water park, I asked if we can also split the parking fee as it comes out of my own pocket (even though it wasn\u2019t much, I felt like it was more appropriate if we all chipped in as we shared this). One of them (let\u2019s call him Kyle) dismisses this and pays the entire parking ticket himself which was very nice of him, but later at the entrance when we were discussing lockers for the water park and if splitting the costs with them, he ridicules me in front of the group saying \u201cwe should split a cost like this and not parking tickets\u201d and the group laughs at me. To make this worse, another friend (let\u2019s call him Nick) tells me after the others move forward that I shouldn\u2019t ask them to pay much as it makes the friendship completely based on money.\n\nNow I\u2019ll admit they have helped out a little. Kyle bought the parking ticket and locker, Nick bought a second locker and everyone in the group besides me chipped in for snacks for the ride. Since this has happened I haven\u2019t asked them to split the fuel and parking for this day anymore. However, I just want to know if im the asshole for asking to split something we are clearly sharing? Especially if I\u2019m driving and taking the risk of accidents which are extremely expensive given insurance and also fuel on myself and a parking ticket they were forcing me to pay? I\u2019ve always thought there\u2019s nothing wrong with just splitting the payments if it\u2019s something the group is sharing but since I was met with such resistance I really want to know.",

I said that we didn\u2019t have much left to go shopping with, which was actually true, but it would maybe be enough for a few days. He then shouted at me and spoke to me in a very rude tone, but not the kind of thing that brothers do to each other. I then got a bit more emotional, because I personally am still an emotional person. He isn\u2019t. By the way, I come from Turkey and we were brought up a bit differently to others. But we all like each other, whatever, let\u2019s get to the point now. He wanted to apologize to me for all the shouting. I just wanted to get away. I just wanted to cry in my room like I always do, because I\u2019m familiar with this, just for context. I may be 17, but I\u2019m very tall and heavy and I\u2019ve been doing martial arts for over seven years, since I was ten, and I\u2019m also pretty strong. I have three brothers in total, but today it\u2019s only about brother T. He\u2019s been a very impulsive person for as long as I can remember and at this point I don\u2019t know if I even pushed him, I don\u2019t think so, but he says I have him and I just wanted to leave and go to my room, but then he decided to take off his jacket and jump at me. And as I said, I have martial arts experience, so before he ran towards me I grabbed him so that he couldn\u2019t hit me, because I didn\u2019t want it to escalate. That\u2019s why I wanted to go to my room in the first place, but he kept insulting me. My other brother C came along as a freak and so on. He then has my brother. T held back because he wanted to hit me properly with his fists. Of course I didn\u2019t put up with that and I didn\u2019t insult him but I said that he couldn\u2019t hit me and that it was retarded to think that he could hit me at all. In the end he apologized, which of course I don\u2019t buy because going back from 100 to one again seems very strange. And please have mercy on my English, because that is my third language.",

            "body": "Am I the asshole?  There's probably a marriage therapy section I should be looking into, but here it goes.\n\nBeen married for 15 years.  It's been a good marriage.   Typical ups and downs, but it's been good.  Like a lot of people, we've been fighting a lot over finances.  I started a construction company 8 years ago.  I should say we, because she has been a big support.  She isn't able to help a ton with the business, but she helps where she can.  Over the 8 years, our construction business has done better and better and we're making pretty good money.  But I've been in construction for 23 years now and now that there's ups and downs and I'm always weary of things slowing down.  In the 8 years we've been in business, it's always been a good economy and I'm terrified of things taking a downturn and not being able to provide for my family.  Over the 8 years, as we've made more and more money, my wife has started spending more and more money.  Like a lot of money.  A couple extravagant vacations a year, peppered with a bunch of smaller, expensive vacations.  Lots of money spent on \"health and beauty\" (nails, hair, clothes, treatments, plastic surgery, botox, etc.)  A brand new BMW over $100,000.  We're in the middle of a remodel that is looking it's going to be around 1.5 million and should have been 1.  Any time I try and talk to her about spending, it blows up.  In the end I always feel like I'm trying to control her, but then this brings up more resentment later when I feel like I'm not trying to be controlling, but I should have a say in our spending.  For example, we got in a big fight over the car because I really wanted to get a more modest suv for our family.   Things have gotten worse as we've moved into a new town.  She's gotten very social, which is good, but I feel like I'm working my ass off and then coming home and having to help a lot with cleaning, cooking dinner, yard maintenance, laundry, and general household duties.  I'm fine with helping out, but it's become a lot.  When I've asked her to try and help out, she supplements the extra help by hiring people to come do the work, which just causing me more anxiety because it's more spending and they are things we could actually do.  Between running the business, helping at home, and raising kids, I'm feeling very overwhelmed.  As I said, when we talk about it, it always escalates and then ends with a semi apology from both of us, but neither of us feeling great about things.  And then nothing changes on either side, and the problem persists.\n\nI know Reddit has a tendency to paint a biased picture and get people to agree with the OP's side.  It's not all bad.  I love her like crazy.  Divorce isn't on the table.  She's a good mom and a good wife.  She has her faults, and her faults cause a bunch of extra work on my end, but I can look past them.  She's a good person with a big heart.  It may sound like she can be pretty self, which she can, but she really is a good person that cares about others.   We've tried counseling and it seems to help temporarily, but the spending habits don't change and the pattern ensues.\n\nI go back and forth every day.  There's an inner debate of if I just need to be grateful for what I have.  That we're are in love, have a beautiful family, and have been fortunate in life.  Or if I'm justified in these feelings of anger as I see the recklessness in spending money and self-care.  Do I continue to try and stick up for myself, or do I let it slide?  I'm not trying to get validation in my position, I'm genuinely looking for advice on if I'm a chauvinistic, old-school husband or if I need to keep up the struggle.",

They were together for 4 years and her and I for 9 months. I felt very uncomfortable with this and voiced out my reasons. The only thing that would come out of her mouth was, \u201cdo you not trust me?\u201d I was very upset that she would use trust to get her point across but I lost that argument. The day before he would get to stay in her apartment she tells me at that moment that she took off the whole week so she could \u201ccater to her guest\u201d. Then she also told me that they (her and her ex) would also see her dad on Saturday. I was completely in tears when she told me that which added to me believing that I should just mentally check out. Two days ago I was going to meet with her ex and herself and we were going to hang out all three of us. I didn\u2019t want to meet up like we didn\u2019t know each other so I asked if we could have a call. I called and tried to ask about where he\u2019s from and where does he work and if he\u2019s in school. After the call she told me that I was hostile and interrogating him which wasn\u2019t my intention. I apologized and said that I wanted to break the ice with him. Yesterday she messaged me that it was best for me not to meet or talk to him when he\u2019s there. Thus meaning I wasn\u2019t able to visit her in her apartment for the whole week. I was extremely upset and I told her that I cannot put up with this any longer and that I am checking myself out of the relationship. I feel extremely horrible, frustrated and melancholic. We both loved each other what should I do?",

I've talked to my man about how this isn't normal and it's weird, he grew up with only her and their parents were Mia most of their life ig from what I got he said every family tells other families that they are sexy or good looking I said maybe good looking and good body for age but never have I heard sexy, Hot, weirder stuff I will not repeat I said nobody in my family has told our kids that they have a nice ass nd he said it's normal all you do is sexualize everything. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fI literally tried getting along with her but we don't mix ATTT ALLL, I try to be really nice when I do see her but she's so annoying I told my man the way she acts around him is disgusting and he says he doesn't like it but she won't stop He said a few times he got to the point of wanting to hit her because she wouldn't stop touching his butt and ripples or sitting on him but he just gets uncomfortable and doesn't know how to react it makes me feel so weird he says the only reason I view certain things as weird is because my brothers and I grew up fist fighting (which we did) but I can assure you I have never touched my brothers weirdly and we are 6 and 12 years apart so no we aren't close.She talks about sex with him and how it feels with DUDES HE KNOWS his friends and stuff he's asked her to stop but she keeps going and going , I don't allow her to have my child alone.

I've talked to my man about how this isn't normal and it's weird, he grew up with only her and their parents were Mia most of their life ig from what I got he said every family tells other families that they are sexy or good looking I said maybe good looking and good body for age but never have I heard sexy, Hot, weirder stuff I will not repeat I said nobody in my family has told our kids that they have a nice ass nd he said it's normal all you do is sexualize everything. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fI literally tried getting along with her but we don't mix ATTT ALLL, I try to be really nice when I do see her but she's so annoying I told my man the way she acts around him is disgusting and he says he doesn't like it but she won't stop He said a few times he got to the point of wanting to hit her because she wouldn't stop touching his butt and ripples or sitting on him but he just gets uncomfortable and doesn't know how to react it makes me feel so weird he says the only reason I view certain things as weird is because my brothers and I grew up fist fighting (which we did) but I can assure you I have never touched my brothers weirdly and we are 6 and 12 years apart so no we aren't close.She talks about sex with him and how it feels with DUDES HE KNOWS his friends and stuff he's asked her to stop but she keeps going and going , I don't allow her to have my child alone. She also is mad because I have rules for my children, no spending the night,no kissing them if they don't want to be kissed, my child is allowed to tell you no, my child can and is allowed to lyk you aren't their parent and you can come talk to their mom (me) if there's an issue, my kids don't have to share their toys or be happy to see anyone if they are feeling upset or irritated, nobody can physically touch them, nobody can bathe my children or change their diaper unless I am near,she has feed my baby after I said no, she's ripped my baby out of my arms and my man says it just sucks bc it's his only family.\nI finally said I hate her, I don't like her, I don't want her around me, she oversexualises EVERYTHING, she's gross, she doesn't follow carseat laws, she doesn't listen to me when I say no about my child and she doesn't know when to stfu unless I'm screaming bc I say the \"most hurtful fucked upshit\" in her opinion I am a biaych.

Since, my mother passed, she's been testing the waters with my friends about the ring and got shut down. I gave her my mother's jewelry box and all the contents of it except items that already belonged to me and a few sentimental items that remind me of my childhood (and Avon turtle pin, a small jade apple pendant, little pin with my mother's birthstone) and the only diamond ring left. My father has the engagement diamond he gave her along with her wedding band. \nWhen this niece tried to manipulate me into giving her the ring, I saw it coming a mile away. I denied her again, saying she should be grateful she got what she did and that I'd be keeping the ring. The niece then launched into an absolute tirade about how she was more of a daughter to my mother than I was and that I treated her terribly. This is also the same niece whose parents didn't want to come to her grandmother's beside as she lay dying, but Auntie defended her and got her parents to agree and let her see her grandmother before she passed... but I'm the a-hole for not letting this bougie, narcissistic child have the only diamond ring i have that belong to my own mother.",

            "body": "AITA for telling my friend not to make this vacation a kid included trip???\n\nA little background, in August one of my best friends gave birth to a healthy baby boy. He already has 3 other siblings and is technically the middle child but hey \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f( if she likes it I love it, I guess.) anyways I\u2019m currently in college and our other friend in our trio is very busy being an amazing entrepreneur that she is! The only time that we can really ever get together is in the summertime (since I have a break from school and the others ones business season dies down some) so we\u2019ve always tried to take a trip and keep us \u201cthe Three Musketeers!\u201d \n\nEver since my friend had this baby, things have changed and we are all trying to adjust. She is very much a \u201cNew Parent\u201d where her entire life has become her kid (you ask her how she is, she just talks about her son, I get it but dang) the other one is trying to find herself with this man that she\u2019s been dating on and off again, who neither of us approve of (we are in our 20\u2019s men with communication issues and ED should be out!) and me well I\u2019m just a college student trying to balance school with my own business support myself. \n\nNow the issue is is that both of their birthdays are in the spring/summer months September being one June being the other both of them want to go out of the country. However me being realistic, I won\u2019t be able to fork over the money for both trips since I\u2019ll still need money for school. When I was talking to the one who has a baby, we were going over the itinerary, flight prices and etc and everything sounded good until I talked to our other friend. Apparently the new mother of the group is trying to plan an all-inclusive trip to South America to include her newish baby\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43. By the time of the trip he should be around one however I know her and I know who she\u2019s invited and they very much have a mentality of \u201c it takes a village and moms need breaks too\u201d which don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m all for! I just feel like she would get better use out of her break if she didn\u2019t bring her kid and try to delegate babysitting off to the rest of the party( which is apparently what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s setting up a babysitting schedule, and napping schedule, an itinerary schedule so on and so forth so that her kid is accommodated for). Mind you he will be the ONLY KID on the trip. As a burnt out college kid who dosent get many vacations, this is not how I wanted to spend my one vacation a year and I know that the rest of the party is 50/50 split on how they feel. \n\nAITAH?? Or is this kinda of insensitive for her to do?",

The company provides him with all of the study material, but the caveat is that he cannot study for more than 8 hours in a time (the study material will lock him out after 8 hours).  My boyfriend also has narcolepsy, which he has had his whole life. He has the kind of narcolepsy that makes him feel tired all of the time, but he will rarely get a good night\u2019s sleep. In the past, he has managed to deal with this while going to school and working full time, as well as graduating with a Bachelor\u2019s in finance. I want to start a life together eventually with having kids and a house in the near future. He tells me this is something he wants too. \n\nAs of now, I am a Data Analyst and he works a manufacturing job. We both agreed that if we want the life we would like to build together that he would get a better paying job, so he decided to go the Financial route. I\u2019ve noticed his studying has been little to none lately. His first test is in 2 weeks and he still has about 13 chapters to study for. When he gets home from work, he tells me he is going to take a nap and to wake him up in about 5 hours so he can study. Anytime I try to wake him up, he decides to just continue to sleep instead, and tells me he will study later. This has happened around 3 to 4 times now. I\u2019m starting to get upset because it doesn\u2019t seem like he is taking our future seriously. I thought maybe he has been overwhelmed with life on top of studying, so I offered to take over some of the bills if he would want to quit his current job so he could just focus on studying. He turned this down. So instead, I\u2019ve been taking care of our dog more often, as well as cooking for us and cleaning the house more on my own to give him the extra time to study, yet he has only studied a total of 4 hours in the past week. He has 2 weeks left before his first test comes up.\n\nAnytime I try to tell him that I\u2019m upset or worried that he is not going to be prepared for this test, he just says \u201cGee, thanks\u201d and goes back to sleep. AITAH?? I don\u2019t want to be a pushy girlfriend, but I don\u2019t want to see him fail either and I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to work towards a stable financial future together. I just don\u2019t want us to worry about money in the future.\n\nEither way, what should I do? I feel stuck. It\u2019s his life, but our future is also a part of his life now",

            "body": "(My apologies for my long windedness.)\nThis was quite some time ago when Vietnam Veterans were harangued by Americans when troops were returning home. Presently, I am a USN Veteran so this story seems relevant to me.\nWhen I was 17, a Vietnam Vet who had recently come home lived close to my parents. My mom would bring cakes/pies she made to this Vet I'll call \"Billy.\" This poor fellow was suffering terribly from PTSD & lived in his sister Sarah's home. (Whom I had a crush on!) Though he spent all his time alone in her garage, where he repaired Harleys as a side business. He was reputed to be a gifted motorcycle mechanic. I didn't know diddly squat about the inner workings of engines & one day Billy was kind enough to get my dirt bike to run properly. At times, my mother asked me to deliver her baked goods or just go & have a conversation. She said this would be a good thing to do (I'd be \"earning grace' I was told). So I did & would just sit on an overturned bucket & watch Billy work on one of the many bikes that folks would bring over for him to fix up. I would ask questions about motorcycles & it seemed Billy would enjoy describing what he was doing. \nOn one such day, a dude shows up & is standing with arms crossed in the garage doorway. Billy & I had grown somewhat tight & I felt great doing this good thing! I looked over & there stood this tall thin fellow decked out in \"hippie\" garb. Sandals, jeans, a colorful poncho & atop his long hair sat a Chinese Red Army military cap. I knew what this hat actually was due to the films I had seen in history class at school. \nHe stood there in the doorway for a moment, Billy looked up, smiled slightly; 'oh hey Jack, how you ...\"\n\"WELCOME HOME, BABY KILLER!\" This dude said really loud. I turned to look at Billy & he dropped his ratchet, sat there staring at this ah, tears forming in his eyes. \nI lost it! Jumped up, ran over & snatched this betch off his feet, slammed him to the ground, & was going to \"ground & pound.\" Billy yanked me off him while I was screaming expletives. Obviously hearing the commotion, Sarah came out the backdoor & she realized just what caused the ruckus. Billy, stood there staring at the ground, crying bitterly, I'm  off to the side fists clenched, Jack is picking himself off the ground, smoothing out his poncho. Apparently this Karen/carl had a history of saying stuff like this about her brother. \n\"Leave now Jack, & never come back' she screamed & he left. She & I helped Billy into the kitchen & sat him at the table. He just put his head on top criss-crossed arms, breathing heavily. Sarah walked over to me & said 'thank you for standing up for my brother' & kissed me on the forehead. (I have to say, regardless of the present situation, I then blushed & my teenage heart skipped a beat!)\namita For attacking that guy- honestly, I did lose total control & was going to smash his face in.",

So today as we were in bed after playing around with each other we cuddle up on our perspective sides of the bed and on our devices doing our things. He reaches over and tries to put his hand in between my legs as to still be touching while doing our own things and tells me to move closer. I have a pillow there already due to hip pain and discomfort so I call him princess and tell him to move closer as his back is to me and my iPad is in between both our heads. He then turns around and demands me to turn around because \u201che\u2019s the man\u201d but I say no and tell him to ask nicely and in a more sensual way. If y\u2019all know where this is going then, this is my way of setting the mood. So after a few attempts I finally turn around and we snuggle for a couple mins. He says ILY I say ILY, turn around and start kissing him.

We have three kids under 5 that need constant attention. \n\nThey always come to mummy first which is fine, low key love that but when I\u2019m busy mid task (if I can\u2019t stop what I\u2019m doing I.e changing a diaper or in the bathroom, I\u2019ll sometimes delegate, ask for help or redirect them to him.

When he\u2019s low he completely shuts off the entire world just sitting on by is phone watching videos for hours, I looked at his screen time thing on his phone once and it was 7 hours a day for a week, I thought this was excessive. I told him instead of sitting in the phone why don\u2019t you go do something for yourself and he says he doesn\u2019t want to burden me looking after all three kids.

AITAH for wanting my bf to tell his son (21), to either buy his house, start paying rent, or move out?\nHeres the backstory...my bf and his son talked about his son buying his house so we could build a smaller one. This was supposed to happen at the end of May when his son got a raise.\u00a0\nA month prior his gf moved in. They took over the whole kitchen. My bf helped me clean out the kitchen before this, so it wasn't so cluttered with things we didn't use. All just so she could put her stuff in it's place. Not the intention we had lol We got it rearranged again and it's ok. No one says anything. Then they do it again! But with coffee cups they don't even use! I'm not talking about 5 ok. I mean, 3 shelves worth when it was already full! All the rearranging was pointless and i couldn't even put up the dishes that had just been washed! Again, this is within a month or so of her moving in. They've already taken his dad's large mirror to their room and still overstuff the wash machine to the point i think it's going out. Now even with all this going on, she's SO NICE! I didn't even say anything about the coffee cups and my bf just moved some of his that we didn't use often to another cabinet that's meant for food. Just to make room for the dishes we use. So then there's the fact that things will break, or yard projects will be done and the son never offers to help. But when he calls, my bf drops everything. I was raised to be helpful if you're not contributing financially, which he could do. I will say the gf does wash their dishes. But there's never a conversation about when we're going to cook so planning dinner can be stopped just bc shes in there, which is frustrating.\u00a0\nThey were looking for places to rent so he's aware how expensive it is. So why not at least appreciate his dad enough to help when he's already treating the common areas of the house as if it were his. Or well, his gfs. I haven't said anything but my bf has mentioned it to me several times how he can't afford the house. So we're in limbo. I have my own house with my daughter and we stay at my bfs lately bc it's close to everything we like, and i want to be with him of course. So obviously we'd like to move in. But with my daughter on the couch, it's not possible. So since I'm gaining from them leaving, I feel like I'm the problem. Do I just keep my mouth shut and wait? Or should i just stay at my house since schools out and see if that helps push my bf into talking to him? I think if I leave though, they'll completely take over and my bf will just let it go until he actually loses it when they take something again. I just want it resolved at this point. I want peace in the house I'm in and I'm not used to living with someone I don't even know. It's weird lol help!! Sorry for the rant.\u00a0",

It does sound like it's impacting both of you and you know from your perspective how you are feeling. Since it's impacting your personal relationship or interrupting your day to day, I think you should feel safe to start this conversation. You know you're relationship best and how you should approach it with him. Hope that helps! Good luck!",

            "body": "AITAH having an adults only wedding?\n\nI am 34F the youngest child in a blended family. My father had 2 kids from his first marriage and my mom had one. The four of us grew up together. I am 13 years younger than my oldest sibling.  When she was getting married nobody had kids but she had her rules for her wedding that everyone respected. My two middle siblings had a very small event with friends because of their situations. So no big reception or anything.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (an only child) and I decided to have an adults only party. Two of my older siblings have kids. The oldest niece is 15 so she is coming to the wedding, the rest are 10 and 8 are not. (there is 4 of them and they are impossible when they are together)\n\nMy future husband's circle of friends is very close and they are like brothers. They all have toddlers. A lot of them. My friends also have babies. They would be offended if my nieces and nephews were allowed to come and their kids not be invited.\n\nWe wanted an afternoon with our friends and family, not screaming toddlers and unruly kids. It is a party, not a conventional wedding.\n\nNow my siblings and a close cousin are mad at me so only they are coming while their husbands/wives are \"staying\" home withe the kids, although they all have who to take care of them during the event.  I think the younger sibling and the cousins were influenced by my oldest one who had a problem with this from day one. They were also together on a vacation this summer\n\nI even offered to organise something fun  for the kids in a play facility near the venue. They all declined.\n\nI am baffled with their reaction. I thought they would welcome an afternoon off, dancing and fun without running after the children.\n\nI also can't understand why my oldest sibling who had her requests for her wedding not respecting mine.\n\nAm I AITAH for not inviting my siblings young children to my wedding?",

After we got married I found out he had been using gay/bi/trans dating apps (previous to us being together) and he lied to me about them\u2026 i was insecure abt it bc before we got married i had a feeling he might like men(i have no issue with this so long as i am privy to it) we had a conversation about our sexuality before we got married(he said he was straight) then after i found the apps he said it was none of my business his sexuality and he didn\u2019t trust to tell me.. i was really offended he trusted me enough to marry me but not tell me something that big\u2026 but i let it go the best i could, a little skeptical. He had said he\u2019d let me see the apps bc all he did was ask politely how they knew they weren\u2019t straight bc he thought he might like both genders but came to the conclusion he was for sure straight\u2026. He solely works around men and sometimes he is VERY secretive with his phone\u2026 i know how badly he wants a kid and family so part of me feels like he used me to get that\u2026 part of me just knows he isn\u2019t straight\u2026. It\u2019s driving me insane but he says it isn\u2019t my business anyway\u2026 not to mention a few months after I found out I took him up on his offer to see his app since he said he had nothing to hide and he completely flipped out on me and said absolutely not it\u2019s not my business (I can agree.. what he did before isn\u2019t.. this why I asked him permission) not only that he said he doesn\u2019t trust me not to go on those apps so I\u2019m no longer allowed to use his phone.. this really bothers me bc in my opinion, trust isn\u2019t broken by someone asking something that makes you uncomfortable\u2026 breaking trust would be if I just went ahead and did it without asking.. and I told him I\u2019d never look without his permission but that it does bug me even more now that he won\u2019t allow me to\u2026 I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll just get over it but my gut is telling me he is hiding stuff",

This is the type of sauna where you have to shower before going in and no clothing is allowed (most wear towels). Like most locker rooms there are signs through out that say no cell phone use for obvious reasons.  Many ladies still use their phones for scrolling, texting, phone calls - I\u2019ve never heard anyone say anything or complain.  I regularly see ladies using their phones in the sauna as well.  Let me add that I am respectful of rules and others so of course I never use my phone in the locker room or spa area (hence why I felt the need to post this), I don\u2019t care if other people use theirs though.\n\nSo, I brought my kindle with me to read while sitting in the sauna (this sauna is definitely not hot enough to damage devices btw).  I didn\u2019t even consider that it could potentially be an issue since all you can do with it is read books.  This old lady who wanted to use the sauna as a changing room came in yelling at me for having a \u201ccell phone\u201d in there.  She said I was going to take photos of her changing her clothes.  I *tried to* explain to her that it\u2019s a kindle, doesn\u2019t have a camera, and its only use is for reading books and tried to show her the kindle.  She didn\u2019t want to hear me out and continued to yell at me.  She went on to tell all the ladies in the locker room how upset she was about it.  Anyways, AITAH here for reading on a kindle in the sauna?",

His parents always have liked me (or so i thought) up until he moved in with me.\nRecently, we been having issues with a stalker. This person has been texting us from all kinds of different numbers so there\u2019s no point of trying to block them.\nWhen this is all going down, his parents are blaming it on me and saying it\u2019s either one of my ex\u2019s. The other day, my boyfriend told me that his parents were saying it could be someone that i\u2019m cheating on him with. I took offense to that because in my head, I view his family like my own, and for them to sit there and think i\u2019m that kind of person hurts me.\nThen his das started making comments about how I want him to buy me expensive gifts. I have never forced my boyfriend to buy me anything. Sure, I throw hints here and there but I never forced him! My birthday is coming up and I mentioned that I really liked this expensive robe. It may be sort of shallow of me to say this but I like high end things. Every gift that my boyfriend has received from me is not cheap. I gift him these things because I know he\u2019s going to like them and it makes me happy. On the other hand, his taste and my taste aren\u2019t the same so we both agreed on me just giving him gift ideas for myself. Well, he showed his das the robe that I liked. His das made some comments saying i\u2019m \u201cabusing\u201d him by making him buy me these expensive things. That if I know he has bills to pay then why am I making him buy me these things and telling him to tell me to calm down..\nAgain. Im not forcing him or pressuring him to buy me anything in any way shape or form. He says that he has no problem with buying me things.. Yet, I have my own money and I like to spoil myself here and there but when I buy things for myself, my boyfriend says he feels some type of way about it because since he\u2019s not buying them for me, he doesn\u2019t feel like a man..\nAfter I found out his parents made these comments, I told him i\u2019m not coming to their house with him to visit them anymore. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s disrespectful because I don\u2019t go.\nWell, today things really hit the fan because my boyfriend had made plans with my dad to go fishing earlier this week to go fishing.. Today, he told me that he\u2019s not going fishing with my dad anymore because his parents had invited them out on their boat..\nHis parents invited my parents to go with them but after my parents found out what\u2019s been going on, they don\u2019t want to go. They also had invited me but I told him I still don\u2019t feel comfortable going after what they said about me. He told me to confront them about it and talk to his parents. In my eyes, I just seeing that as making the situation worse because they can misunderstand something and that gives them another reason to hate me.\nWhen he got home today, I tried to talk to him about everything that\u2019s going on and he just got mad and shut me down. He then called his parents and told them that I take offense to what they said and now his mom is saying that she never thought of me cheating and that my boyfriend misunderstood what she said and told me that.\nNow the relationship just feels off and he\u2019s going out with them and his best friend and their family this weekend. Completely bailing on my dad now.\nAm I the asshole for getting mad and wanting to leave him?",

We are both 20 now and have always had fights but not as bad as this one. A few months ago i found out i was pregnant by my now ex fianc\u00e9. Me and him made the conscious decision to have an abortion since i am a college student athlete who lives in a different state and he works full time. (It was not planned we used protection and it broke and i took bc pills). \n\nNow this is the situation. After the procedure i was still in pain and wanted my loved ones by my side. My ex couldn't be there that day due to work which I understood so i asked her to come over. She never texted me back but showed up a few hours later crying. I listened to her talk about how her then boyfriend cheated on her and she didn't know what to do. I gave her advice and listened to her and comforted her. After she was done pouring her heart out she starts to grab her things and leave. I asked her if she was staying and she told me she never had any intention of coming in the first place. She only came over to tell me this then to go home. Later in the day i text her how i feel and she tells me I'm over reacting. We get into a huge argument which results in her telling me to kill myself. (Im a suicide survivor) so i tell her we can never be friends again and that i was done putting so much into our friendship when shes never really been there for me when I needed her. . \n\nWe haven't talked in months and our friends are telling me that i need to forgive her because its not worth giving up 15 years of friendship. But my family is on my side. So AITA?",

Let me back track a little. My boyfriend and I have been dating for around 8 months. We had a great and loving relationship until around being together for 4 months he started acting really controlling. \n\nWe were together 2 years ago but it didn\u2019t work out, so we broke it off, and now we\u2019ve had a healthy relationship until around 4 months ago. He started asking to see my phone, accuse me of cheating, making me remove a lot of my friends on snapchat and instagram, creating fake scenarios in his head, etc.  Around 2 months ago, I started to lose feelings. He\u2019s going into the military and keeps asking me if I\u2019m ready to make the commitment. At first I said yes, but now I\u2019m second guessing it. I love him but I\u2019m not IN love with him. \n\nAbout a week ago I began talking to a guy in my class Nick (17M) but Nick and I have gotten super close and so I decided to add him on snapchat. We started sending each other homework answers and kept it super casual because of my relationship, but all of the sudden, Nick becomes my best friend on snapchat which sends my boyfriend through the roof. It stirs up the pot and creates an explosive argument during school where I\u2019m on the verge of crying because of the stuff he was saying. My friends were telling me to end the relationship because of how toxic it is, but I can\u2019t because. I know how people will react and make me to be the bad guy, especially his friends. We also have a prom coming up and I don\u2019t want to miss it because I don\u2019t have a date. After our argument yesterday, I\u2019ve been distant trying to show signs that I don\u2019t want to be in the relationship anymore but he keeps ignoring them. If I\u2019m completely honest, I think I like Nick, but I don\u2019t want to get my hopes up if Nick doesn\u2019t like me back. \n\nI leave for college in August and he leaves for basic training, I know it isn\u2019t going to last, but I\u2019m scared of the reaction I\u2019m going to get. My mom also likes him a lot. the first boy I brought home that she gets along with, but this isn\u2019t a relationship I\u2019m willing to stay in. So? Am I the asshole for staying in a relationship I\u2019m not happy in?",

I haven\u2019t touched a pencil since high school. \n skip down to bottom part if you want to fast forward if you want context read the next part. \n\nI\u2019m 21 (Male). For as long as I can remember my childhood has been goofy, but not the worst. My parents along with my moms side immigrated from Mexico so it has been a ruff start from before I was born. That being said my father was lucky enough to get a house with fake socials. Leading us to  live on whatever was left of his income \u201cnot much\u201d. Life was good. Anyways to earliest I can remember I was rarely invited to my cousins birthdays celebrations or party\u2019s. I\u2019m 2001 baby so everything they did was posted on Facebook. Anytime I would invite my cousins for the most part 1-2 from 10 would show up. It was generally the parents just stoping by for the food chatting and then making some excuse to leave early. Just bothered me they didn\u2019t make time. \n\nNow to the main part. \u201cCousins from the baby shower\u201d she has always been a hot mess. That\u2019s being generous. I figured that while I was living life guiding myself like I was the only kid who made it. I\u2019ve taught myself several life lessons as I\u2019ve had several older figures absent in my life. That being said I made it my choice to reconnect with my cousins at the age of 18. I made several attempts to hang and pay for their food. The entire time it was her being obsessed with her shitty bf at the time and dog whistling me. They broke up after like 2 miscarriages and the excuse for acting shitty with us was. \u201cI\u2019m going through it\u201d which I believe she was. She had several temper tantrums along the way. Calling me a fuck boy and names in public. As you can guess because her hate for men. \u201cAll men aint shit \u201d I\u2019m 21 now so as you can guess 3 years wasted. She used to be a smoker and supposedly quit because she has a new boyfriend and pregnant almost 3 months after meeting him. To kill off any love I had blindly for my cousin Last month she was applying for a job and they asked her for a urine test. She called me asking for my sample. I was in shook and even asked me if I could asked my gf. (27) ;) . Anyways I got the text for the baby shower invite yesterday. She\u2019s even asking for baby things. but I don\u2019t plan on going. Cutting of a passive aggressive family who degraded me any chance they got was part of the plan before she got pregnant. it\u2019s not just her it\u2019s all of my cousins. I have story\u2019s for all them if anyones wants to know hmu for the remix. \nConclusion \nPregnant cousin wasn\u2019t part of my life and didn\u2019t bother until she got pregnant.",

It\u2019s been really hard because of mental illness and world events affecting what I\u2019m majoring in. I\u2019m also the first one in my family to graduate from a four year university. To celebrate we\u2019re having a smallish (small for my family) graduation dinner. Even my aunt and uncle that live in Florida are flying in. \n\nMy brother is expecting a baby and is engaged so my mother decided to host a engagement/baby shower. It was planned the day after my graduation, months ahead because family will be in town. That was fine with me, albeit a little annoyed I wouldn\u2019t be able to celebrate with friends bc I\u2019ll be roped into help prepare but I understand. I also was understanding when my mom approached and ask if we could just have the dinner bc it would help save money for the shower. \n\nBut I just found out that they\u2019re planing on surprising all the guests with saying their vows. Like this was just thought of maybe this week. I wasn\u2019t even suppose to know of the surprise, I just overheard my mother talking about it.\n\nI get why they\u2019re do it, they\u2019re pretty laid back people and would want a smallish wedding. And if all their important family members are already gathered - why not. It saves money and it logical. But I can\u2019t help feel annoyed and a bit like my major achievement is being overshadowed. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for being annoyed that my brother is planning to turn his engagement shower into a surprise wedding the same weekend as my college graduation?",

A month ago he told me he had to talk to me about something important. I honestly thought maybe he just wanted to break up but it got SO much worse. \n\nMy bf sat me down and said that there a problem the problem being he\u2019s falling in love with me\u2026. when he said that I got SO confused, and I asked him why that\u2019s a problem and that\u2019s when he told me that he\u2019s actually married (and has been divorced) and lied about his age (he\u2019s actually 42). I sat there SHOCKED and I didn\u2019t know what to say. When I finally came out of shock I got up grabbed my stuff and told him to NEVER call or text me again. He tried saying what most cheaters do that I was different and his wife and him hadn\u2019t been happy in a really long time and was considering getting a divorce. I still grabbed my stuff and left I didn\u2019t think twice about it. \n\nThe problem came about two weeks ago where I my period was 2 months late. I wasn\u2019t worried because I am extremely irregular but after being late for a second month I decided to take a EPT and it was positive I thought maybe it was a false positive and took 6 more and they were all positive. I was so upset I cried out of shock and anger with the whole situation. \n\nI called my now ex and he didn\u2019t respond. I texted him telling him I needed to talk to him.  He said if I was \u201cpregnant\u201d he didn\u2019t think it was his and stop texting and calling.\n\nI was livid because I wasn\u2019t the one lying, cheating, and on top of that now being pregnant I would have to explain to my family the real reason we broke up and not only that but I\u2019m pregnant. \n\nFast forward to This past weekend on Mother\u2019s Day my family and I were celebrating by going to dinner Saturday night. I\u2019m about 12 along and have to pee ALL THE TIME. When I was walking to the bathroom I saw my now lying ex and he was there with his family and based on body language his wife. I was so hurt and angry about everything I didn\u2019t think before acting and went to their table I introduced myself and told everyone at the table what happened and showed them pictures and announced my pregnancy grabbed his drink and threw it at him. After I said everything I wanted to I looked over at his wife she was pale and bawling I felt so bad but I was so hurt and angry. Did I take it too far AITA?!\n\n**Edit** \nHe doesn\u2019t have children. His wife and him were having dinner with all adults at their table my family was celebrating Mother\u2019s Day.",

We moved in together in June and I moved out in September because things just weren\u2019t working between us. I officially broke it off in December and decided it was best if I try to heal my mental health problems before trying to work on our relationship. We went a month or so without talking and then rekindled our relationship again in February. We started going on dates and hanging out abs because I was mentally ready to be in a relationship again I decided I was going to keep pursuing our relationship. My family and friends do not like him and his family and friends do not like me. However, we bought a house together. He told his family that we were just talking instead of the truth which is that we are dating again and living together. His mom and dad keep telling him that I am just using him because \u201che bought a house\u201d and how they don\u2019t trust me. I asked him to  stand up for me when they say stuff like that and he has. However they now think that I have \u201cbrainwashed him into being with me\u201d and that \u201cI am no good for anything or anyone.\u201d I told him that it\u2019s okay that they are upset and don\u2019t like me, but if they do not learn to get over it or at least respect me  I will not let them be in our future child\u2019s life (we are planning to have a kid soon) he said that he knows that I deserve respect but thinks it\u2019s wrong that I keep them from their grandchild. I think that if they can\u2019t respect me as the mom then they don\u2019t deserve it. So AITAH?..",

Because if you let your parents be involved when they don't respect him and your relationship then you're a hypocrite and that's not ok.\n\nYou all need an intervention. Your kid is going to miss out on his/her history and knowing fully who they are because the adults in your future child's life don't know how to be civil.\n\nAt 21 and 20 you're probably tired of hearing this, but you both are really young. You've broken up already for less than 3 months then jumped into a house. I think you both need to slow down and let each other grow into legitimate adults, he can't even legally drink yet and neither of you can rent a car. I don't mean this to be harsh, I'm only 26, but I've seen this exact story play out with my friends multiple times.\n\nGive yourself 2 years with just the 2 of you, then go from there. 23/24 is completely different from 21. You will have a lot more clarity in a short period of time. The way you guys are going sounds like hell for a kid, and divorce as a 25 year old.",

My boyfriend was a heavy drinker as a teenager and doesn\u2019t really drink much or almost at all. I\u2019ve never seen him drunk in person. I was curious as to what that looks like but I never pressured him into getting drunk.  A little bit ago I found a video on his snap memories( he doesn\u2019t use snap much and we know each other\u2019s passwords no big deal) it was of him and his ex gf drunkenly singing and laughing. At one point he is like lifting her shirt up. He didn\u2019t know it was there and it was from a long time ago back when they were together. It made me think about how I kinda wanted to see that side of him more. I\u2019ve been trying to get him to go out to bars or clubs with me but we\u2019re either busy or he doesn\u2019t drink there and I\u2019m the only drunk one. Which isn\u2019t as fun to me.

I found out that my painting had gone missing last week, along with my friends favorite painting as well. These painting were both huge and our favorite works. They looked at the cameras and saw the janitor leaving with broken frames and it was uncovered that she had completely ripped her art off the frame of the canvas, ripped up the canvas material, and it was also crumpled up with blue paint splattered on it. It should also be noted that her painting was placed near the trashcan, but not labeled as trash(it should also be noted that it is just common sense not to throw out, or even touch, art in an art room. ) So we found hers, but mine  was nowhere to be found. \n        The next day, my art teacher asked her what she had done with my painting, and she said, \"oh i got rid of that weeks ago.\" mine wasn't close to the garbage at all. It was sitting on an eisel. that same day, i confronted her. all she could keep saying was \"I thought it was garbage\" and \"I\u2019m sorry\" with an attitude. I was so devastated and distraught that such an mistake could be made. \n           So who do I think she may have just taken it? One thing I couldn\u2019t help but notice that she had an anime tattoo. My painting was very heavily based on the anime, \u201cparasyte\u201d. She may have just liked it and taken it home, and thrown out my friends painting to cover it up, knowing that footage can\u2019t be recovered from weeks ago, or that nobody would even bother. This painting was also put on display, so she had seen the painting prior. Another thing that I find weird is that she said it was thrown away long ago, but my friends testified that they had seen it recently(one or two weeks ago). That may have just been an oversight on her part, but she appears to be very artsy, and an anime fan, I can\u2019t see her doing that without specific reason. Another thing to add is that paintings have been placed in these specific places before and NOT thrown out. Please let me know what you think, I will be asking to see the footage on Monday alongside my art teacher.",

I truly believe autistic people are soo unique :) \n\nI (24 F) have a sister (26 F) and she has a 3 year old daughter, who is turning 4 next month. I love my niece, considering she\u2019s the first niece in our family so whenever my sister had her, I was so thrilled for her. \n\nWhenever I would visit my sister and her baby, I would hold the baby, but I noticed that she would rarely ever smile, like babies normally do. I understand babies can have bad days, but this happened anytime me or someone else would hold her. I immediately felt like something was off with the baby. I would even try to do anything to make her laugh, but she would just always give me or anyone else holding her, a blank stare and no laughter. \n\nThen, the baby got older. She now became used to seeing me and my sister\u2019s other friends. But I noticed that her behavior still seemed off. (Just to add, I used to be a nanny, so I\u2019ve taken care of many other kids from other families, including ones with disabilities, and ones without, so I\u2019ve seen behavior of other kids, not that this makes me an expert.) \n\nAnyway, my niece\u2019s behavior still seemed different. Below are some things she does:\n\nShe\u2019s 3 years old and flaps her hands really fast every time she gets excited about something. \nShe also tends to blink really hard randomly. She\u2019ll even space out for an extremely long period of time. \nShe hates toilets and will scream her head off if she even hears one. My sister has been struggling to potty train her because of this.\nMy niece will shake her head side to side randomly at times. \nShe\u2019ll repeat things that she hears people say. For example, I\u2019ll tell my sister, \u201cI love your shirt!\u201d And my niece will repeat the same exact thing I say, despite me not speaking to her directly. She does with every single thing she hears. \nShe\u2019ll cover her ears from just watching a simple movie, saying it\u2019s too loud. \nShe\u2019ll arrange her toys in a straight line every time, no matter what she\u2019s playing with.\nShe\u2019ll spin herself around in circles all the time and never get tired. \nWhenever she was 1, I would call her name and she wouldn\u2019t respond, and my sister would always say, \u201cYeah, she has a habit of ignoring people when they call her\u2026\u201d \nMy sister has also mentioned that when my niece was a little younger, that she didn\u2019t like playing with other children, and even said she was, \u201csocially awkward.\u201d I know kids can be shy and with some it can take them a while to warm up, but I didn\u2019t know if it was normal for them to be \u201csocially awkward\u201d in the toddler ages.\n\nThing is, my sister believes that these are all \u201cjust personality traits\u201d of my niece, so she has never gotten her checked for anything like Autism. If my niece does have autism, I feel like it\u2019d be really beneficial for my sister to know, so that she could understand why my niece acts a certain way and what she could do to help her. I understand I shouldn\u2019t be concerned because that\u2019s not my child and they very well could be just traits, but I feel bad for secretly believing she has autism, and for the fact that I haven\u2019t said anything to my sister about it.\n\nSo for believing that, AITA??",

The one remaining at work went and ate with these sick coworkers during lunch break Friday and potentially risked exposing everyone at the office. Other people in the office saw a picture posted on social media and started freaking out not wanting to get sick as well or bring it home to a family member. All of this was brought to me as I am going to be a manager in the near future. (fingers crossed if I work hard enough) Because I had been made aware of the situation, I felt like not saying something made me a liar/responsible if anyone else got sick and I was already in a difficult position as the people in question are my friends. I brought the information to the owners/ managers to let them handle it. When the coworker got back from lunch, she was sent home and very upset because she stated no one was contagious. (However, the day prior, this same coworker begged to leave early to go pick up her kid and have them checked out to make sure they were not sick. So were they contagious and needed to leave or were they not and she could go to lunch? I would also like to mention I thought she would be asked to put on a mask and not get near anyone. I had no idea she was going to be sent home.) Long story short, she is really upset because she feels betrayed and wants to know who told on her. I was asked what happened and instead of just being honest and explaining it was brought to my attention by other employees and I passed the information along and it grew from there; I didn\u2019t say anything and lied by omission, which is not who I am at all.

He was a good guy, we talked on the app for about a week before the date. We literally covered all the basics and then some. He picked me up and when we were chatting in the car I noticed he was slurring his words. I could tell he wasn't drunk so I just figured it was a speech impediment and I was ok with that. We stopped at a dollar store to load up on some snacks because we were going to a drive in movie. When he got out the car it was very obvious that he had cerebral palsy or something similar affecting the left side of his body. It literally looked like every step was a risk of him falling over, and the left side being impaired makes sense for his words to be slurred if the left side of his face was also affected.\n\nHe did not tell me about his disability before hand, I literally found out during our date. I'm already a shy person and unfortunately, easily embarrassed. People were looking at us, and I could tell they were thinking \"why are they together?\" Or maybe wondering if I was some type of gold digger or care giver, I don't know. But I was uncomfortable. Especially because I was dressed nice for a date, and he was extremely casual with a t shirt that you get for free for going to an event/concert and cargo pants.\n\nNow I feel like I need to ghost him or figure out a way to explain that I want to explore other options without making him feel bad about his disability.\n\nI know this is a sensitive subject because it's something that he can't control, but I feel catfished. And this is the 3rd or 4th time that I've been in this situation with someone who didn't disclose a physical disability.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting a heads up? Or even deeper, am I wrong for wanting someone without physical disabilities like me? And how do I navigate this?",

You need to be understanding and patient with her, letting her know she doesn\u2019t deserve this type of treatment no matter where she works or what she does. If all the women at her job come together to stop him something could be done but all of them, including ur gf, need to understand that this is not okay. That won\u2019t happen until someone takes the time to break the image of how women should be treated in the workplace.

I\u2019m not going to go into detail but I\u2019ve always been scared and uncomfortable around him. I finally told my parents and later my boyfriend/his best friend (15m) about what happened. They\u2019ve been friends for over 10 years. I\u2019ve dated my boyfriend for a little more than a year. He believed me and stopped being friends with my cousin. A little while later he talks to me about possibly being friends with my cousin again and though the subject made me want to throw up I told him it was fine and it wouldn\u2019t ruin our relationship as long as I didn\u2019t have to see my cousin. In reality I didn\u2019t want him to be friends with him again but I thought I would just deal with it if it happened. He told me he wouldn\u2019t because he was worried it would break us up. Just yesterday I was inviting my brother to my Minecraft server (lol) when I saw my cousin and my boyfriend online on the same game. I asked my boyfriend what he was doing and stuff and he eventually told me he had been talking to my cousin for a couple days. This was out of the blue and I felt betrayed. He hadn\u2019t told me anything it seemed sort of secretive and he had been so open about the subject before. I wondered if I didn\u2019t ask him about it if he would ever tell me. He had been really distant for the past couple months. Making excuses for why he can\u2019t talk saying he\u2019s going to bed at 11 when normally he stays up until like 4am. I just kinda brushed it off though. I sent him a message saying I couldn\u2019t date him bc of him being friends with my cousin and him being secretive and lying. We weren\u2019t very close anyways but I thought he at least still loved me. (As much as a 15 year old can \u201clove\u201d) he responded \u201cI understand\u201d and I said \u201cis that it..?\u201d And we haven\u2019t talked since. I\u2019m secretly hoping he will tell me he loves me and stop being friends with my cousin but even if he did I would take him back. Am I the asshole?",

After moving here a year later my mom suffered a stroke. Now her left side is completely paralyzed. So I\u2019ve been taking care of her since I was 11. I help her with everything, I help her put her clothes on, I help her shower, I serve her food. And I also stick by her side when me and my family go to events, while my brother goes and hangs out with his friends, my dad goes and hangs out with his and the same for my grandmother. I\u2019m the one who has to stay by her side while they also go and enjoy the event with their friends. \n\nNow to the main story: I\u2019m planning on visiting my home country next year around this time because I have summer vacation. I haven\u2019t been back to my home country since moving to America while my brother went to visit last year, and my dad and grandma went to visit at the beginning of this year. I also really want to go visit but my mom also wants to come with me. But if I were to go with her I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything I want to do cuz I\u2019ll have to take my mom with me as well. My whole family is also insisting that I take her with me but I don\u2019t want to because the whole time I\u2019ll be stuck taking care of her. And I\u2019m scared on expressing my feelings about the trip and my mom to my family because they will just call me an ungrateful bitch and yell and shout at me. \n\nSo AITAH???",

She\u2019s always been my moms fav while my oldest sis (19F) Lexie is my dads fav. Penny and Lexie have always been a duo as long as I can remember. They always left me out. I\u2019ve basically always been the black sheep. But in recent years Lexie has been trying to build a relatively good relationship w me. And while Penny always made me feel left out she\u2019s always been overprotective and like a second mom to me (which is why I have a big attachment to her). But at the same time Penny has always been excused for her mean behavior to me and Lexie because my parents suspects she has some kind of undiagnosed disorder. She doesn\u2019t do well in social situations and has been bullied in kindergarden. But I\u2019ve always been the only one critiquing her and acc speaking against her. But recently she\u2019s been overly concerned about unhealthy foods. And recently I\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s been going off on how unhealthy everyone eats especially towards Lexie. She ate some Nutella after going to the gym last week and my mom+Penny has been talking bout it non stop. I myself have never had a good relationship w food and have under longer periods of time barely eaten one meal per day. And Lexie has been bullied a LOT of her tennage/childhood years cause of her looks+constantly under pressure by my mom and now Penny. So I started going off on her for being controlling and shouldn\u2019t worry so much about how her (19 year old) sis is eating when it\u2019s non of her concern and that there is a difference Of being controlling and acc being concerned. She told me I should Stfu and stop being so selfish and feeling sry for myself. So I snapped and told her to stop acting like mom.\nI can\u2019t help but feel guilty. AITA???\nPS she was on the verge of tears and told me that she had enough of her always being critiqued by everyone around her which made me feel like even more of an AH. But she keeps making nasty comments about my anxiousness and depression and difficulty having a healthy relationship w food. So am I rly the AH here???",

            "body": "AITAH for this basically, Ok, so I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. I am F21 and my fiance May (fake name) F20 and we are getting married in July 2023. I love her to the moon and back and I am so glad I get to spend the rest of my life with her. I started dating my fiancee in Year 13 so I was 18 and she was 17. We have had a few arguments and when I did I would confide in my male best friend I'll call him Jake. Jake was always the kindest person and my second favorite person after my girlfriend (now fiancee). I am a very open lesbian and go to pride every year and spread relationship stuff online, as long as May is ok with it. Ok so now you have context here is where the problems started. I proposed to May in April of 2022 and she said yes. In late April we announced it online so everyone except our families could find out. The day after the announcement Jake sent me a paragraph about how May was cheating on me with a guy I will call Mark. May is also a very open lesbian so I knew this was fake. I told him this and he said she was faking her lesbianism to hide this relationship. Firstly, this is BS for obvious reasons but also she comes from a very Muslim background and spent the first 8 years of her life in Iran, coming out was a very long and difficult journey for her as her parents took a lot of time to even let her live with them. Jake doesn't know this as it's not his business (she's ok with me saying it here as it's anonymous). I talked to May about it and she said it was not true she even showed me her phone and she didn't know the guy she was supposedly cheating on me with. I told Jake to cut the BS and just didn't reply to him as this hurt May deeply and she always comes first for me. Things quietened down until a week ago when Jake came to my door with flowers, a load of his friends, and signs asking me to go out with him. I still remember what I said so I'll say it here. 'Jake, you were one of the first people I came out to, you know I don't like men. I have never seen you as more than a brother and I never will. You can't come knocking on my door with men I barely know and make me feel uncomfortable and threatened to say yes. The answer is no, don't try again.' He said something else but I just slammed the door in his face and went to May and cried on her shoulder. I felt betrayed by Jake and disgusted in myself that I didn't realise it earlier. I have tried to focus on my wedding but I keep getting messages from Jakes's friends saying to 'give him a chance ' and one even said 'trust me he's a great boyfriend ' to which I replied 'you date him then.' After that, I stopped replying and I am in shock that someone I have been friends with since the start of high school is that self-centered. All his family is calling me an asshole except his sister (my maid of honoUr) and I don't think I am but I want some unbiased views on this so. AITAH?",

Nobody asks me if Im ok they only ask her about it and I\u2019m tired of it. But the divorce Is still going through and she has been looking for guys online since. *LEGALLY STILL MARRIED BTW* She met a guy and has been talking to him for at least a week he has met her parents *my grandparents* and they have been hooking up and going on dates *WHILE SHES LEGALLY STILL WITH MY BROTHERS DAD*. Although I want her to be happy she has been spending all of her time with him and always talks about him. Forgot to say he has a son to a previous marriage. Tonight he came over with his son I will call him Jack. My mom and her bf left to go to the \u201cstore\u201d to get milk and some food or sum and left me with max and Jack. I thought that they actually were going to the store but in reality they went to his house and was having s\u20acx while I was watching my brother and his kid.

            "body": "AITA: FOR NOT LETTING MY DAUGHTERS DAD HAVE CONTACT WITH HER RN\n\nHey everyone I\u2019m new this so I hope this is how it works. Just to get it out there I feel like I\u2019m an asshole and if I am I want to fix that. I need advice and I\u2019m sorry this is so lengthy. I don't know what to do in this situation.Right now I have decided not to let my ex to talk/see our daughter until he gets sober. A little recent back story. He went to rehab out in California seven months ago and in that time he's had four relapses and on this last relapse he left Rehab with a female, proceeded to get drunk and have a (spiral) as I call it. He ended up fracturing his foot and hurting his fist and wrist pretty bad from kicking and punching a concrete wall and he ended upgoing to jail for drunk and disorderly, drunk in public,and assault against a peace officer. And after he bonded out I he moved in with the girl at an extended-stay motel in CA she's an alcoholic as well and now theyare in a relationship and have moved back to his hometown where his daughter and I are located and are living in an extended stay motel here. I told him wasn\u2019t happy about everything that happened and that it wasn\u2019t smart since he was putting someone else in front of his recovery and in front of his daughter. I recommended if they really think they are soulmates after three weeks of knowing each other that they go opposite ways and do long distance while they work on their self. (of course I didn\u2019t say the 3 weeks part out loud) And he took this as me trying to control him and ruin his relationship?? Even though I\u2019m the one who called it quits after 4 years of trying to help him. The part that bothers me is how much it hurts my daughter,  my daughter is three years old and she is always wandering and wanting to see her DADDY, always asking about him and wondering when he\u2019s coming home I mean it's been seven months since she seen him and it just hurts me to know that she hurts.Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Another catch is we\u2019ve also stated seven months ago eight months ago when we broke up that no significant other would be introduced for a year and now he's trying to push that to six months. And I am obviously not gonna let him have her by himself especially In Charlotte which is very busy and hectic city and his girlfriend doesn't want him here with me without her here but she is not welcome in my home nor is she welcome to meet my daughter. Is there anything you would do that I haven\u2019t? or is there anything that I should\u2019ve done differently? Right now as far as I know it's just drinking but I've been down this road with him many times before it'll go from drinking to doing coke to doing heroin. I'm just so hurt for my daughter. And every time she asks to talk to her dad, I want to let her. But I\u2019m conflicted. Am I saving her all the hurt of his bad choices and the consequences that come with them or am I hurting her more by not letting her have contact while he\u2019s making the choices he is. should I let her see her even though he's a been away for 7 months and may be another seven months before she sees himagain should I let him FaceTime her and give her evenmore false illusion that hes coming home eventually and everything is going to be OK? Thank you for reading if you've made it this far any feedback would be sooo appreciated",

They did everything together, did and liked the same things, etc. Two years ago they broke contact because my boyfriends friend spread false rumors about him, turned people against him, etc. Then they became friends again and the good relationship started back up. Me and my boyfriend met when i was in high school over a year ago and began dating, his bestfriend hated me from day one. Two months into our relationship i made a really bad mistake (not cheating) and we worked through it, and came out stronger. his bestfriend has hated me since, called me names, threatened to kill me, and generally became worse. For months i spoke to my boyfriend about how i didn\u2019t understand how he could be friends with someone like that, but he said they\u2019ve always been friends and he doesn\u2019t want to loose his friend. Well two months ago his friend accused me of trying to steal his money and my boyfriend politely told him that \u201che isn\u2019t going to take about me like that\u201d while he was saying to my boyfriend that i\u2019m a liar and i\u2019m saying all these nasty things about my boyfriend (not true). very minimal contact was has between the two of them until school started in which they have a class together and sit beside each other. the phone calls, and texting has started back and it\u2019s really upsetting. I asked my boyfriend today if he wanted to be friends with him again and he said maybe. But part of me feels like It\u2019s horrible for me to feel that way and that it\u2019s wrong, so AITA?",

We have a great relationship and truly do go well together!We are both muslim and from the same culture upbringings, we are supposed to get engaged very soon, and marry early may, both of us are virgins, and must stay virgins until the wedding night. However we cuddle, kiss, have oral sex and even sometimes anal. However tonight when we were cuddling I really really wanted to put it in but he stopped me and got mad! he has made it crystal clear before and almost every day that he has no intention of having vaginal sex until we are married. Now Im kinda of annoyed because we do Literally everything else. Its not because of faith or religious as to why hes choosing to wait\u2026 it is because on the wedding night when we finally do have sex, someone will check the sheets for blood. Since when the cherry pops there should be blood!, am i the ass hole for being annoyed? we do everything else which (we technically shouldnt even be together without supervision) we might as well fuck!",

            "body": "Am I the asshole for making a joke about how my ex best friend slept with the man who r@ped me\n\nSo I 16F got into a fight with my former best friend also 16F. It goes way back since I was 11. I was r@ped by my step brother from the age of 7-14. My friend (we\u2019ll call her A) A what had happened to me when I was 11 in 6th grade, I know I was 11 since the r@pist was 16 and only got 6 months probation for it. She then was aloud to come over to my house in the summer of 7th grade. Around the age of 12-13. He would\u2019ve been 17-18 at that time. Soon after she started to come over she developed a crush on R (my rapist) one night she told me she was going downstairs to get some water. She didn\u2019t come up until at least 30 minutes later at first I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Couple weeks go buy and she tells me she kissed him but that was all. I was upset but got over it. Fast forward Years later I started hanging out with some of her friends after i had gotten out of a really bad breakup. She says they were \u201cbad influences\u201d but one of them were her friend. She told me and him that we need to tell her when, where and what time we would go hang out with anyone so we kind of stopped talking. I had found out from this friend (C) that she had actually slept with R that night. I confront her and she started playing victim. Saying she didn\u2019t know at the time. which is a lie Since I told her when we were 11 and she\u2019s claiming to have slept with him at 13. She then goes on to say she never meant for me to find out like this and that she was going to tell me but she didn\u2019t want me to be upset with her. May 1st 2022 the day of her birthday party, we were all joking around and she said jokingly that she  hated everyone and I said \u201cyou can\u2019t hate me if you slept with my rapist\u201d she got quiet and hours past. She left the room with one of her other friends then Her older sister comes downstairs yelling at me saying I\u2019m a bad friend for making her cry at her own birthday party and I\u2019m a toxic friend. She said that me and A shouldn\u2019t be friends and that if it wasn\u2019t for everyone being here she\u2019d beat my ass. So I then go on to say \u201chow am i a bad friend. Your sister slept with the man who raped me for 7 years and lied to me about it\u201d I left the party after that. I guess no one knew that she slept with him. Fast forward too now, I have a boyfriend and she goes on to tell him that she was 13 and R was 16 when she slept with him. Now people of Reddit if she was born in 2006 and he was born 2001 how in the hell could she be 13 and him be 16? Well she called me a toxic manipulative bitch to my boyfriend once again claiming victim. So I\u2019m just curious am I the asshole for making the joke about her sleeping with the man who raped me.",

I (19F) am having issues with my family. When I was younger my Dad and Mom were both using meth so my childhood was never great they fought all the time and even got physical a few times. I got whipped with a belt more times then I can count and often had red marks or was in so much pain I had to ask my sister to check my a** to see if I was okay. Fast forward to around 12y/o my parents got a divorce and I stayed with my dad my sister with my mom. I don\u2019t remember a lot from this time except that I ended up moving in with my mom to be closer to my sister. Well my mom went to jail so my sister and I were sent to our dads. Then my mom got out of jail and my dad ended up getting clean around a year and a half later. The relationship with my mom never got better and she passed when I was 17. My dad throughout this time was never perfect he has a lot of anger issues and in general has always made my sister and I feel like we can\u2019t talk to him about our feelings without getting yelled at or told that we\u2019re basically overreacting and that\u2019s why I\u2019m having such a hard time now with what I\u2019m going through. I my whole life have stepped on eggshells around my dad just to please him or not piss him off in fear of getting yelled at or him just not understanding my emotions and telling me there invalid. Now that I\u2019m older and more aware of what I went through/how I\u2019ve been treated I want to forgive him but it\u2019s hard. He doesn\u2019t put in much of an effort to see me or visit me now that I\u2019ve moved out and it was to the point I would cook dinner just so he would come over and stay a while. Here\u2019s where I need advice\u2026 I told my dad that ever since he got a new girlfriend I feel forgotten about / left out. He said he understands why but that it\u2019s a two way street and I need to make an effort to. My issue is I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to please him and make an effort I\u2019m just tired and ready for him to take some responsibility. I want to tell him it shouldn\u2019t have to be a two way street because as a parent I feel it\u2019s his responsibility to have a relationship with his kids and to be in our lives I don\u2019t feel I should have to make an effort in order for him to make one to. So basically AITA for feeling like my dad should make an effort without the condition that I do the same? I feel like he should make an effort no matter what to be in my life because he\u2019s the parent. Am I wrong?",

Now Z would annoy us but near the end of practice he shoved his fingers up my ass. Now I reacted like a normal person, I turned and cursed him out and pushed him, now thankfully the coach didn\u2019t hear me curse out Z because he was helping a person with their passing. So he only saw me push him and I got in trouble. He continued to stick his fingers up my ass and even did it to others. So tonight he did it to my sister and I was mad so I waited and when he got in trouble for smacking my twin in the face with a ball I snapped. I pulled my coach over and told what Z had been doing how was sticking his finger up peoples asses and the coach didn\u2019t believe me because me and Z didn\u2019t get along so I think he thought I made it up but when he said \u201cI doubt he did this he doesn\u2019t seem like that kind of guy\u201d I said \u201cask (friends,twins,and sisters names) they will say he did now I was furious so I tried my luck to make myself seem like I was crying because he did this to so many people and I wanted coach to believe me even if it meant fake crying so I did. And coaches attitude suddenly changed he was more serious and said \u201cok I\u2019ll ask them and if they say Z did stick his finger up their butt I\u2019ll talk to the head coach.\u201d Now we all found him annoying so when the coaches asked they all said yes they didn\u2019t want to lie for his sake because he was just an asshole. So there was a lot of evidence against Z so the coach said he would handle it and said he may be kicked off the team.Now Z did truly love soccer to his credit ( he always went overboard on skilling). But he was decent and I saw him start to cry. So am I the asshole for potentially getting Z kicked off the team for doing this to people I am only asking cause I did fake cry to make it more believable so I feel guilty that he may not be allowed to play here again. Am I the Asshole?",

Also I have history of my mom only calling me for asking me for money, so I was not trying to be excited because of those bad memories, but I couldn\u2019t help to feel happy about it.\n\n\nDuring Friday I needed to do a COVID test that it was required by the airline and I did, my sister ( the one who asked me the advice) said to my mom in the passenger seat that what it was gonna be served in her engagement party and mom offered menudo, then later my sister replied and what about dessert, and my mom said that there\u2019s going to be cake, I didn\u2019t give importante because I thought I heard wrong, and I asked my mom again a little bit later that if there\u2019s was going to be a birthday party and she said again yes but never clarified about another celebration, the day went by and nothing happened,  all the family went to take to family photos, it was already late and I was feeling a little bit sad because usually my mom when we celebrate our birthday\u2019s, usually we make it a big deal, cooking a veal dinner party with balloons and cake, and it was already late for that . \n\nWhen all the family arrived after the family photo shoot at 10:00 pm, my sister and all of us seat around them so her fianc\u00e9 could ask her hand in marriage, and then later all of us could celebrate with a dinner, at the end my family only sang the Mexican birthday song( short version) and that was it. I was angry at my mom for not letting me know that the wanted to do my sisters engagement party and my birthday, I could\u2019ve understand if they wanted to celebrate if at least they could\u2019ve told me but nobody did, I\u2019ve could agree, but I feel hurt, i immediately stormed off and  I left to my room to pack the rest of my stuff, then I called my mother to the kitchen,  I told her that she always do that to me and asked why she did that? I told her that my birthday celebration was important to me, she said that she thought it would be good for all of us to celebrate both things, and I answered that I was expecting something special because I never got to visit often, she answered that she\u2019s the worst mother of the world, and also if she goes to hell, I\u2019ll go as well because of the things that I did in my youth, like my bad decisions, later my brother joined my mom saying that I should be grateful that at least I got to have a cake, and that I was ungrateful and a bad daughter, he approached me like if he was gonna slap me, kind of in a menacing way and I told him that if he wanted to slap me then go ahead I will not defend myself at all, when my eldest sister heard this,she approached the kitchen interrupted the conversation and sent me to my room, it was late and I was disappointed. \n\nThe next morning, my sister in law said the same thing about that I should be grateful that at least someone bought me cake. And told me that embarrassed myself and them with the in-laws and that I should be ashamed. I overheard my brother making jokes outside of the room where I was staying my my younger sister and her husband, I was about to grab my stuff when everyone hid or faked to be asleep, my heart broke, because I\u2019m never there, I never visit and that was the last time I was with them, they never went to say goodbye. The only person who said goodbye was my nephew asking me if was gonna visit later, and the answer broke me, I said that I wouldn\u2019t I a long time. \n\nI said goodbye to my dad, and asked me not leave like that, and I said that. The main reason to visit was because of him and that I was happy that I did on time. \n\nI tried to grab an Uber and my eldest sister offer herself to take yo the airport, I reluctantly accept and she started to tell me how I embarrassed her with her boyfriend and that she was the one who offered to buy the cake because my mom forgot to do so. I told her that I was not gonna invalidate my feelings and I that I was tired of being seen as ATM. \n\nI tried to say goodbye to everyone in the family chat , no one responded . \nDays later I told my mom that I was hurt and she responded the same thing that she said at the party, later the sister who was supposed to marry asked me to leave the fuck alone my mom, and so I did, I stopped talking with everyone because sometimes they used to send hateful and petty messages. Blaming me for my mother\u2019s mental health.

Another group banned me for a rule violation and refuses to accept the fact that I have a legitimate, professionally diagnosed disability with regard to reading comprehension. So I missed a particular rule in my reading of the rules. Despite this, I have graduated college and been accepted into my master\u2019s program all while running a successful business. When informing the mods of my disability and respectfully requesting the opportunity to fix my error, I was told that this is a text-based platform so there is nothing to accommodate. The mod also stated they can\u2019t listen well so the just do listen to podcasts, implying I shouldn\u2019t be trying to participate in online text-based communities. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The ignorance is strong with that one. I literally was able to pass the ACT and SAT to get into college and pass written tests all through my primary, secondary and post-graduate programs. Am I perfect, obviously not. I suggested what reasonable accommodations would include, like not having the rules in one giant paragraph, but in a list instead. I know that isn\u2019t unreasonable as it\u2019s literally one of the listed accommodations for my disability among other reading comprehension disabilities.\n\nMost social \u201ctext-based\u201d platforms allow for the opportunity to fix the issue, so I don\u2019t see this as being an unreasonable accommodation either. I don\u2019t know of too many visual online groups. So, AITA for saying sorry, can I fix this and not do it again now that I am aware? I certainly didn\u2019t break the rule knowingly.",

For wanting to take this baby and run? \nI met this man who invited me over and we start to do the deed with protection in his living room and all is well and we switched positions and I felt weird but we continue.

I thought that\u2019s wild but I mind my business ( I\u2019ve been told people don\u2019t like you telling them about their parenting habits). As he gets up to put the kid back to bed I notice that the cond0m is broken through. I put my clothes on immediately and when he returns I say I\u2019m ready to go home. He pleads and gaslights me by saying that he didn\u2019t know the cond0m was broken and I having experienced this type of situation in the past and not being able to speak up thought may I\u2019m putting my trauma on another person I  believe him apologize and stay. Months later I chose to hang out with him again  because his number was in my phone and we start making it a regular thing discussions are had and we stop using protection and I get pregnant within the month and we chose to keep it. He then tells me he feels good about the situation because we\u2019ve only argued once. I say \u201cwhen?\u201d He  laughed and says \u201cthe 1st time we had s3x  and I took the cond0m off  \u201c I ask \u201cso you did in fact take the cond0m off?\u201d  \nHe laughs more and says yea . I\u2019m uncomfortable soI laugh too. I let him take me to 2 dr. Appointments and tried to think can I get over this and he has since shown more unsafe qualities. I already had decided I want the baby but now having only one week left to get an ab0rtion I want to either do that or leave with the kid. The idea of leaving with a baby seems immoral as well so would I be the A H to keep it and exclude him?",

This week I got sent there again and she asked about him and I tried to keep myself together because he had passed away recently.

Buys me flowers takes me to dinners we game togather all day which makes our long distance so easy! This month its the 6th month of us being togather, he is a caring man who always stay connected and calls, anyway he had to leave back to the states to spend the holidays with his mother and sister, the calls and attention isnt there anymore but he blames jet lag and being busy with family which i dont second guess him and i just believe, yesterday i bugged him to facetime and he was in the car and after asking him why dosent he call me as much he breaks down saying (i have 2 kids and i was married for 7 years but now am divorced) i get goosebumps and keep crying becuase this man to me is the definition of prefection and i imagined a whole life with him and he lied about his life for 6month knowing that am  serious about this relationship and so is he!

I texted him about it a few hours ago. He made me seem like the bad guy for saying something about it. I feel like I did nothing wrong. He told his grandma that I texted him about it and now she\u2019s blown up about it and said that I\u2019m not welcome to their house anymore and things like that. They\u2019re saying that I\u2019m accusing them of being incest and things when I never did say that they are. I just feel lost at this point.\n\nEdit: so I\u2019m getting his stuff up from my house because I\u2019m not welcome back over to his house and he\u2019s getting my stuff up and his grandma is being a b*tch about everything. Also I bought them Christmas presents and can\u2019t take them back and i have no use for them so idk what to do with them. Should I just give the presents to them?\n\nEdit: I gave them the presents anyways. Me and him did have a little rough patch not even a month ago where we broke up for a week because he was always gaslighting me. He always said my feeling we\u2019re ridiculous and stupid and things like that. I shouldn\u2019t have given him a second chance in the first place but I was torn up and thought I loved him so much. I do love him but he didn\u2019t love me the same way I loved him I guess. Anyways he instantly started gaslighting me when I said something to him about the things that were happening and I just felt that was a little off because why would you start gaslighting someone unless it\u2019s true I\u2019m my opinion. He has me blocked on everything now but it\u2019s best that he does.",

My ex-boyfriend choked, and left bruises on me, then the following morning carried on abusing me and poured a drink all over me as I pleaded for him to stop. His mother was aware of what he was doing to me and made no attempt to help me. I broke up with him over text and left later that day, to go back to my house as I was staying at his. My family all told me to block him and never talk to him again, but I thought that because this had only happened once, and that I still loved him, maybe I could fix him. However he told me later on that he knew halfway through the abuse that I hadn\u2019t cheated and what he was doing was wrong, yet still decided to do it. Fast forward to now, we have kept in contact, but with many arguments along the way, but never going without talking for more than 3 days. He did start to make growth and better himself, but recently he is starting to fall back into old habits, like getting easily angry and shouting at me through the phone. About a week ago he suggested that I should go back over to his house for NYE, and I started to consider it. I asked my sister if she would drop me off, as I cannot drive, and she didn\u2019t like the idea of me going back to his house, as she was the one who took me home after he abused me. She made many other valid points and it really made me reconsider if I should even see him this soon. I told him that I couldn\u2019t go to his house and he got extremely angry at me and started saying things like \u2018now I know your true feelings, you don\u2019t want me anymore, just block me and go\u2019 etc. After he calmed down I said maybe you could come here instead as then my family and I would feel more comfortable and we agreed that I would ask them today, but I never did as I was starting to get uncomfortable with the reality of having to share a bed with the man that knowingly hit me. I told him all of these feelings and again he keeps telling me that I don\u2019t love him, I should spend NYE with another boy, and telling me that I\u2019m the bad guy because he wants to see me and that saying I don\u2019t feel safe around him is rude because he \u2018knows\u2019 he won\u2019t hit me again. So AITA for not wanting to spend NYE with my ex-boyfriend?",

            "body": "AITA for thinking my friends are two-faced?\nTo try and keep things short, I (22F) have been in a group of friends for 4 years (we\u2019re just 4 girls and i\u2019m the youngest, 2 of the others are 23 and the oldest is 24). This past year, I\u2019ve been subject to a lot of hardships and really had my willingness to live tested to its extreme; but I\u2019m thankful to be in a better place now. \nRegardless, let\u2019s get into a bit of detail; the AITA?\n\nThroughout the past year, after working through my depression and other issues, i started realizing that my presence within the group is really just.. unwanted. I didn\u2019t feel included, and i felt like I was just invited out of sympathy. So, I started to make up reasons to why I can\u2019t make it, because I felt like if I flat out declined, they\u2019d feel rejected somehow or insulted; and I really didn\u2019t want any trouble.\nI was upset that I wasn\u2019t able to be with my friends like before, but I really feel like something is off and they kept brushing me off. \nIt didn\u2019t take them long to stop inviting me out or talking to me, honestly it felt like it was a God send to them. \n\nWhen I try to talk to each friend individually, they tell me I should try to reach out more and put more effort, I acknowledge that I may have been distant, I apologize, and I try to make up for what I did. But they don\u2019t end up trying to put in any effort in return..? \n\nHere\u2019s an example; \nFriend H, \nI\u2019ve texted her a few times and they usually end the same. I ask how she is, she does the same. I ask if she\u2019s up to anything and she says she\u2019s free, I tell her let\u2019s meet up soon, she says she\u2019ll check when she\u2019s available (which is totally fine, i get that she has a life.) and I tell her that sounds great, I\u2019ll wait. I always see her posting on socials with her other friends (again, totally fine) and she never texts back or initiates a conversation again, if I see her coincidentally somewhere, she berates me with how much she misses me, so I tell her we should hang (again) and she says definitely, and then she leaves. \nIt doesn\u2019t feel so nice.. again, not entitled to someone being nice to me, but it might be a common decency to just tell me you don\u2019t wanna hang out instead of leaving me hanging every time\u2026? \n\nFriend Y, \nWe\u2019ve had our fair share of fights, and they usually end with me giving in, so I\u2019ve resorted to generally just keep her at an arms length. \nShe keeps trying to supposedly hang out since we live pretty close, but every week is a new excuse.\nOne time we made plans and I was actually excited to see her. Our usual spot is a coffee shop 10 minutes away from the both of us, which is great! Tell me how, the day of, she says she\u2019s at the same coffee shop, but the branch which is almost an hour away.. Also, H is with her! (Which had blown me off just the day before) \nFor context, I have a strict curfew and it was already late, which she 10000% knows. \nAm I looking too much into it or was this intentional..? \nAnyways, I politely declined and told her we\u2019d meet another time, and said they should have fun. \n\nFriend O, \nThis one is weird, and I didn\u2019t see it coming.\nShe\u2019s the sweetest one, and she tells you when something is off and reassures you a lot. \nI admit we drifted but there was never bad blood, we never fought or really did anything to intentionally harm one-another. \nWe would disagree sometimes but it was always civil. And it confused me so much when she just completely shifted her dynamic. She did confront me about how she was upset that I was distant for a while but I apologized and told her she\u2019s totally right and that I would be in contact more often, but she\u2019s always dry. \n\nThese are just some examples, there are so many more but these felt reasonable enough to share.\n\nAt this point, my fianc\u00e9 and other friends are telling me that I should just cut contact and move on. I just really wanna know, AITA?",

We met in school because he had an exchange year from South America to Germany. The family he stayed with was from one of my friends and that\u2019s why H got in my friend group. We went to festivals and clubs and H and I eventually got together after he asked to kiss me at a festival. Everyone thought we looked so good together and I lived my best life. I loved this guy so much, I still do. In the months that were left we spend the rest of the time together. I always wanted to be with him, I enjoyed every little moment. When it was the time to say goodbye, I cried for hours. We knew that we would break up and we talked about it a lot. He said I was his first serious relationship and that he never met someone like me. But now, three weeks passed since he left and he is like another person. We broke up but we wanted to stay in contact. I felt that something was off with him and he said that he doesn\u2019t want that contact anymore and that he doesn\u2019t love me anymore because we don\u2019t see each other. He wants to forget me and told me that I should forget him too. We had a big fight after that and I got deleted everywhere. After that my mood was down, till now. This guy did something with me I cannot describe. I love him like hell, I never loved someone so much like him and he knows that. I would do anything to see him again and to be with him. He means so much to me but he thinks I\u2018m crazy for that. I tried to let go, I really tried. But I just can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to. I just want him back. I feel so bad without him, I don\u2019t feel loved anymore. Everyone\u2018s telling me to just let go and that we will never see again. But I can\u2019t accept that. I want to fight that we get back together or at least see each other. I can afford a trip to his country but he doesn\u2019t think that it would make sense to visit him. Probably because we would have to travel to each other for some time. I understand him in that point but I don\u2019t understand how he could lose feelings that fast.\nWhat can I do to make things work again? What can I do that I feel better in the first place?",

Everytime I walked into a room he\u2019d leave, or wouldn\u2019t speak to me etc, this went on just short of two weeks until I asked him and he said there wasn\u2019t any problems. Then about a week after I asked the argument happened out of no where, I mean I walked into our living areas and he started shouting, it went from being accused of doing things I didn\u2019t do and as I said had proof to being really personal. I get when you live with friends/ work people youse have arguments but not only was this nasty and personal it was childish and petty. \n\nIt got to the point we did not speak for weeks so I decided to move out. This also lead to me changing jobs, I had worked at this job for 5 and a half years and Jason was only there a year. After I emailed our landlord explained I wouldn\u2019t be renewing my contract at the property I spoke to Jason and we agreed to be civil at least until I move out. \n\nI moved out about a week before Christmas and took a good few of my belongings, and just after Christmas I came back for some\nMore of my things. I spoke to Jason when I was there and explained I will be back after the New Year as I had a bed and a few more belongings to move and my dad was coming up with his van to help me move them and he wouldn\u2019t be free until the Wednesday after new year. I also said I would sweep , mop and give the room a clean (not that it needed a deep clean but it\u2019s nice to clean a room properly before someone moves in) Jason said this was fine especially as I had my rent paid up until the 17th of January so I could come and go as I please. \n\nI came up with my father to collect my belongings on Wednesday to find Jason had gone into my LOCKED room and bagged up all of my belongings into black bags, including my underwear and left them in our hallway and some really personal belongings and took apart my bed and moved it into a different room. I was shocked. Some things are broken / missing and I want to give another look before I throw around accusations but one special thing is missing. I would also like to add Jason never rang or text me to say he\u2019d be doing this or ask if this was ok. He also never messaged me afterward to say he did this  And as I mentioned before he knew I\u2019d be coming on this day to move my stuff. \n\nJason wasn\u2019t there when I had come for my things but had moved ALL of his belongings into my now old room, and I spoke to one of the other housemates who will be paying me back my deposit as he took my place within the house. He said he couldn\u2019t afford the full amount but we worked out a payment plan. This was fine as I know financial struggles especially after Christmas and I wouldn\u2019t ever put someone out. I said until my deposit is fully paid back I will not be giving in the keys. My other housemate did not have an issue with this but I know Jason will . \n\nI would like to add that me and the other housemate have no issues. \n\nAm I being just as petty or am I right ? AITA?\n\nQuick Edit- what are your options on him going through my things too. I\u2019m interested to see other\u2019s opinions.",

For example he raped me, on more than one occasion, and when I told him what he had done to me he literally cried. So pathetic, I had to comfort him after he raped me. Anyways, I told my sister I feel extremely uncomfortable that she still associates with him because there is literally no reason to be in contact with him, I have him blocked on everything and have been NC for months. But she still hangs out with him and talks to him on occasions. And I absolutely hate this, the fact that she talks about him makes me sick to my stomach.

We got into an argument and I stormed off to my room, I\u2019m extremely upset and feel sick that my own sister is okay with associating to this trash that caused me so much pain, and she knows how much he put me through which makes me feel even worse.

We were close friends before and after a few years realised we could be more. We had a good bond, after a few months I felt he lost interest, so I asked directly whether he wanted space or not, which he denied. I felt unwanted, disregarded and very anxious at times. I am not a clingy person, but being in an ldr needs a good amount of efforts on both ends which I made clear to him.\r  \n\r  \nHe always used to say that he is unable to give time due to different reasons, I understood them and didn't raise that topic unless I was in a very bad state due to the lack of efforts. Whenever I did raise, that kind of behaviour is affecting me, he used to just say that I am making him feel guilty and like he is not putting efforts. He enjoyed time with his friends, went out, went on trips but rarely had enough time for me. There was a point when he even asked what it will be like if we go back to being friends.\r  \n\r  \nI asked him again if he wants to get out of the relationship, he again denied and just said he is going through a tough time which I could understand because I was going through a tough time too, but I was there for him supporting him however I could, meanwhile myself crying all night because I didn't get the support in return or empathy for that matter.\r  \n\r  \nAt last I just told him we should take some space because it was getting tough to handle and that's when he told me there were days when he didn't wish to talk to me, I was unaware of that and just did what I used to normally, which was so unfair and made me feel unwanted. So I asked him what he thinks about taking space and his response was that I have thought it through, so I can take the decision and he will accept it, that's when I just lost it and broke up. He didn't even wish to take a stand about anything.\r  \n\r  \nThen even before a month has passed, he had messaged to tell he started dating his childhood best friend(I knew her) and wanted me to know from them that they are dating and not from a third party.\r  \n\r  \nWhile I was trying to understand what mistakes I did, how I can improve, praying he feels better and doesn't do anything wrong, feeling sorry for hurting him, even though it was necessary step for me, he was thinking about dating and that too while orchestrating that I ruined everything for him to our common friend circle.\r  \n\r  \nI blocked him after, but before that he had a few choice words to say. He said it was me who had promised him that we will stay in touch after the breakup after a brief period of taking time and space and now I am denying him what he needs i.e. maintaining a bond with him.\r  \n\r  \nIt took him days to start dating again, which he claims is not a rebound relation, AITA to cut all contact from him and not wishing to stay in touch?",

We were long distance so we didn\u2019t see eachother often but when we did we would have fun . The first time we hung out he had planned to take my virginity and I agreed to it being the dumb gullible young girl I was . We hung out , did what we did, and that was that . I regret it. Fast forward to two months later and the relationship got super rocky. He started becoming distant and not responding consistently like he usually would . I don\u2019t chase men so I let it be . I was devastated he wasn\u2019t paying attention to me but just a day later I found out he was messing with a girl was mutuals with. She is the same age as me and she told me all about how he treated her and she even showed me proof and screenshots. I immediately flipped out and texted him going off on him and cursing him out , you know how it goes. I ended up saying some really awful things to him which I still to this day feel bad for . He ended up blocking me on all social media so of course I texted his number and continued to insult him . He blocked me there too after . Fast forward to three months later I got added to a chat with him and a bunch of his friends . We ended up conversing and he unblocked me. We were cordial but didn\u2019t talk much until two weeks later he added me to a chant with his girlfriend. I know he did it to make me jealous. It worked , and she ended up asking me about him. Me being mad realized that he actually groomed me and manipulated me into a lot of things . Of course I gave in and told her all the details and even provided screenshots. She was shocked and I expected her to break up with him. She ended up blocking me and he did was well he texted me and got mad I told her. Weeks later I continued to stalk her Instagram to see if they were together. No luck . Until today when I saw them together on my tiktok for you page. I am more so upset that she is staying with him knowing he\u2019s a pedo. Am I the asshole for letting her know what he did ? I mean either way it seemed to go over her head.",

Your instincts are right that he has manipulated you, purposefully made you jealous and has been able to mess with your emotional stability. You should not be worried about whether you were the AH. Who cares. You should have been the one blocking him as soon as he took your virginity and quickly got board and moved onto another young girl. Part ways from him and his gf. It\u2019s hurtful and you need to find yourself again and break away from this pain. What\u2019s done is done. Let it be a great learning experience for you where you don\u2019t repeat these patterns. You regret being with him, getting back in contact with him, and now you\u2019re questioning yourself about how you opened up to his GF. Because she obviously believed whatever BS he told her about you. It\u2019s been a path of regret and that\u2019s all that\u2019s ahead for you if you don\u2019t let go and move on. Trust me. I\u2019ve lived life and there\u2019s nothing healthy down this path. It\u2019s just making you feel icky over and over again. Don\u2019t have sex with the next guy your crushing on either. Be the kind of girl that makes a young man wait for a long time. You\u2019re so young. There is no rush. If a boy really likes you for you, there will be zero pressure for sex. They will want to spend time with you. I didn\u2019t have sex in high school at all, but dated several cute, sweet boys. I set clear boundaries with them all and said I was not having high school sex and I was waiting until I was older. I said I was looking for a boy who would respect that. No one dumped me. In fact, I think they began to enjoy the innocence of teen years themselves. It\u2019s already exciting and new to get to go out on dates and kiss! And hold hands. Leave it at that. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to know your high school boyfriend really just wants to be with you and isn\u2019t there just for sex. Find someone who wants to enjoy the sweet things with you. This guy ain\u2019t it!",

            "body": "AITA for not taking my teenage step-sister shopping for her homecoming dress?\n\nBefore I start to tell you guys this situation, first I'm going to explain why and how I ended up here. Sit tight and grab a snack because this is a long one...\n\nMy name is Valentine (yes just like Valentine\u2019s day) and in July of this year, I'm going to turn 20. I was born in Brazil to a very poor mom and father, my mother was a state teacher and my father at wasn't working due to his alcohol ab*se. They two had a divorce right after I turned two and he disappeared. During my whole childhood, I had to see my mom struggle to be able to afford rent and food, but apart from the financial troubles I had a nice childhood, was always very good in school, and helped around the house as much as I could. When I turned 14 (in 2017) my mother broke financially to the point where she couldn't afford to feed the two of us, so we made contact with my father's family to see if I was able to live with him for a while, we then found out he was living a pretty comfortable life in Portugal with his wife and their kid. We were desperate at this point so my mom sent me off to live with him. For the next 5 years, I struggled to live with my father due to his alcoh*lism and other substance ab*se. Fast forward to 2022, I graduated high school as a valedictorian, as soon as school was over I got a job and started to study for the university entry exams which I aced last December, and with that, I was accepted to study International and European Law at the University of Applied Sciences of The Hague ( in the Netherlands). In the meantime, my mom met a man and they moved together to the Netherlands with his daughter (F14) and this is where our story begins.\n\nAfter graduating high school I got a job as a sales associate for a big American brand, which paid quite well so I was able to start a savings account for my college tuition since my mom had just moved with her husband to the city in the Netherlands where I was going to study I didn't bother to save money for a dorm in my college, so I just saved for my tuition. In August I bought a one-way ticket to Amsterdam and moved to my mom and her husband's house. \nIn the beginning, everything was fantastic, he was super nice, and his daughter was just the sweetest kid, I finally started to relax after all the years of stress of living with a vi*lent and alcoh*lic father. Me and my step-sister I, let's just call her Ana, and I had a blast together, we went shopping, and we had picnics, dinners, and movie nights together.\n\nThings started to change between us when she started to go to school, and I and my mom started to spend more time together since none of us were working, I would take care of the household, cook, clean, take Ana to school, to cheer practice and pick her up after, I assisted my mom with most of the chores while studying for my University exam. Ana started to make up excuses to not spend time with me anymore, and little by little she stopped almost completely talking with me and would only do it if she needed me to do her a favor. That of course messed with me a little bit but I was too busy studying for my exams to really care about it. Unfortunately, things drastically changed after I was accepted into University. The day we got the results back, my mom was thrilled, she made a special dinner dedicated to me and made sure that all of our relatives knew about it and about how proud she was, Ana although, refused to join the festivities because \u201cthe food wasn't of her liking\u201d. A couple of days later my stepfather (50M), called me to his office to have a chat, in which he told me he was very disappointed in me and that he never expected such inconsiderate behavior from me, of course, I was very confused and asked him what he was referring to, which he responded that at the night of my special dinner, I made Ana cry after I told her that she would never have a nice combination like I did because she's dumb and would never get into any colleges, apart from the fact that I would never tell her that, this interaction was fiscally impossible because she didn't attend the dinner, she was in her room the whole evening. Even though I explained that this situation never happened and would never happen, I felt as if he was still skeptical about it. To be honest I was mad as hell, like how could she make up a lie like that when all I ever did was be nice to her?\n\nAfter this incident, we went apart for good. I brushed it off and didn't really think about it since she's just a kid, boy was I wrong about this one.\n\nLast month I started to work part-time at a clothing store in the center of The Hague, which you know is enough so I can cover my own expenses and to save a little more for my college books and tuition which I have to pay now on June 1st. I was finally able to put 2k in my savings account in between last month and this month, which I was super proud about! Of course, all good things have to come to an end, and a couple of days ago everything went to \ud83d\udca9\nMy stepfather called me as soon as I got out of work and stated that we had to have a serious conversation when I got home. I left my work in a rush to get home because I thought that something serious had happened. As soon as I got home, Ana and her my stepfather where sitting in the sofa waiting for me, she was sobbing frantically holding her newly bought homecoming dress. I asked my stepdad what was wrong and he just asked my why did I ruined Ana\u2019s dream dress, I was absolutely shocked to hear that, Ana then started to tell us this very sad story about how I was jealous that she went shopping for homecoming dresses with my mom because when I had my graduation my mom didn't went shopping with me (she was in the Netherlands and I was in Portugal so that was very impractical). I never even got close to her dress before and even if I did, I have no reasons to do such a stupid and pointless thing as ripping her dress, which I told him and Ana. Of course, he didn't believe me and blamed me for ruining her homecoming, and that I had two options, I can either buy her another dress or I am no longer welcome in his house. I am definitely not buying her lying a*s any dress. In result to this he gave me 2 weeks to pack all my belongings, find a place to stay and get out of his house for good. \n\nI never before asked strangers for help, especially on the internet, but I unfortunately don't have money enough to move to my university dorm and still pay tuition in June. With your help I might be able to get a place, don't starve and pay for my tuition. My school dorm is \u20ac715, without any furniture, and I have to pay three months of rent in advance, which is a total of \u20ac2.145, I also need to pay two fees, one of \u20ac150 for cleaning/painting, and one few of \u20ac50 for The Hague municipality registration, in sum is \u20ac2.210 just for the moving. If you guys want to help me to not be homeless I started a GoFundMe to raise \u20ac3.000, which is going to cover all this fees and deposits, plus a bed, some cleaning supplies and food for a couple of weeks. Thank you for reading till now, and I really appreciate every single penny that you guys can donate, and even if you are broken like me, you can still help me sharing the link below to my GoFundMe. Thank you so much!",

Having my grandfather round for dinner isn't easy as I get overwhelmed by change and a lack of structure, it's not easy having to be 'switched on' constantly because people are round at my house so I asked my parents if we can have dinner without him on the night before I have an exam they agreed and promised that would happen. But a few nights ago he was at my house when I got back from college. I assumed he would go home before we had dinner so I didn't bring it up. Turns out he stayed for dinner after my mum asked if he wanted some curry. I didn't bring it up in the moment because I don't want to hurt my grandfather. But later that evening I got into a heated text conversation with my father over it. And it all ended with me saying that they don't put my first. This isn't the only example of this happening but it was one of the more hurtful ones because it feels like I've been forgotten about and like they don't remember that I lost a grandmother, I'm doing my a levels and on top of all that I generally just find life very stressful.

I was in my cousin\u2019s wedding. ( let\u2019s call her B) When it came time for her bachelorette party the group had picked a place to stay. For 2 night split between 12 people it was about $150. So I told her I would still be joining just not staying at the same place as them as I couldn\u2019t afford that as I am planning my wedding as well. She then took me and my mom, my mom was helping as much as she could with her wedding, out of the group chats after we had paid for our bachelorette party shirts and said we were still going. The girls in her wedding party were catty except for her maid of honor, let\u2019s call her A. My mom and I were staying with my other cousin (still related to the bride) so my mom asked if she could tag along. Making sure it was okay several times before inviting ,Let\u2019s call her G, G to go to B\u2019s bachelorette party. B said it was fine each time. \n\n So fast forward to the night before B\u2019s wedding all the girls stayed the night at the venue and ,let\u2019s call her R, has been low key rude and hateful the whole process of the night. \n\nFast forward a little more I gave her a few weeks before texting about my wedding and bachelorette party to her. We are talking about plans for the one night ,low cost everyone home that night, bachelorette party. When the group gets a text from B saying \u201cHey I\u2019m going to see if R wants to go and I\u2019ll just ride with her.\u201d Right afterwards I call to tell her I would not like R to come but I already told A she could come if you want to ride with her that\u2019s fine. What can I say other than that I had already invited one of her friends because she really doesn\u2019t know the rest of my wedding party and I didn\u2019t want her to feel uncomfortable. After we hung up I texted her asking if we could go to lunch and talk and she said I can\u2019t I have to help R. The worst part is she used my mom inviting G to her bachelorette party. We were at the bar and she told me she would probably not be coming to my bachelorette party because she has to save for her honeymoon even though my wedding and bachelorette party is months away.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit she is one of my bridesmaids\n\n\nSorry if this doesn\u2019t make any sense or is all over the place.",

            "body": "AITAH for trying to enforce boundaries on my sister?\n\nMy sister (13F) and I (15F) have always had a rough relationship. She often steals my things, a regular sibling thing, however I have had issues lately getting her to stay out of my personal spaces. Recently, she has started invading my privacy by going through my room, or my side of our shared bathroom just to take things she might want to use. (We both have a crap ton of stuff, the only differences in what we have being stuff we buy ourselves or the color of our toiletries/clothes.) About a month ago, I decided I needed a tote bag to keep all of my crochet supplies together, and while I was waiting for my own to arrive, I asked to borrow hers. She agreed, on the condition that I let her borrow a fairly prized hoodie of mine. (Regardless of the fact that I rarely take her stuff, and that the tote bag I used is almost never used by her.) I agreed, and gave her the hoodie. A week or so goes by and my bag arrives, so I give her hers back, and ask for my hoodie. She lost it. I was very angry because this was not the first time she hadn't given something of mine back right away, but that fact that she had lost one of my favorite hoodies made me furious. I've been bringing it up about every week or so, asking her to find my hoodie. She hasn't started looking.\nA few nights ago, she was at a sleepover, and I was walking past her room before noticing a makeup item of mine. I went in to get it, noticing that she had to have gone through all of my makeup to take it, as I had bought that particular one myself. I felt as though I'd been stripped of my privacy, like there was nowhere I could put anything and it would be safe. I then noticed more of my things slowly accumulating a pile of 5 clothing items (sets counting as one) and 3 other items (Makeup, highlighter, shoes). By this point I'm fuming, and write a letter for her to find detailing that I was extremely frustrated with her lack of respect for my space, and that I wanted my hoodie back.\nShe ended up getting a light concussion, so I took the letter back not wanting to make a big deal out of it. \nTonight, (2-3 days later) we were on the way home from a friend's pool, our brother, parents, and her friend all in the car with us when she brought up me going through her room. I explained why I had, and told her I wanted my hoodie back again, and that I was angry she had gone through my space when she gets extremely angry if I so much as touch the carpet just beyond her doorway. Eventually, my mom gets involved yelling at us both about how her stuff gets stolen all the time (I don't take her stuff, our styles are very different I have no need for any of it). We get home, and I'm very mad now, so I head inside as soon as I can, angry that she's yelling at me for stuff I don't even do. I make it into my bedroom, where my mom enters a few minutes later, as she usually does after our fights. We have a conversation about the argument, and I go to mention the way I had felt when I realized my sister had been going through my spaces, before stopping myself. \"Nevermind\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Nevermind\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Nevermind, Mom, you're just going to say \"welcome to my world\" or something like that\"\n\"No, I won't\"\n\"okay, I was just going to say I felt like nothing here is safe- like none of it is really just mine-\" she made a face perfectly described my  \"welcome to my world,\" \"See? That exactly what I was talking about!\" Admittedly, I raise my voice when I said it, though the response from her was \"you get in these moods-\" I interrupted, \"I don't want to talk right now.\" I did want to say something else that I'd regret later. I was trying to be mature and end it before it got worse, like she had told me to do so many times. But, her reaction was to swivel around and storm out slamming the door behind her before coming back and saying \"you're one of the most self righteous, selfish brats-\" and stormed off, slamming the door again before coming back a second time, \"I don't think I've ever been this mad at you.\" And she slammed the door again. I felt like a dog who'd just been hit. I dont know what I did to make her so angry. I was trying to enforce boundaries, and then tried to avoid letting things escalate. I don't have any idea how I could have made her so mad, yet I feel like such a fucking dickhead. \nAITAH?",

When the teacher came back, I tell him to escort my friends to the library to do written work because they were acting reckless and almost blinded themselves. They were escorted to the library and there parents were called because hydrochloric acid can blind you if it went into your eye. Also, the glass shards could make you bleed . I was concerned for their safety and told their parents about it.

While on the other hand my other elder sister (24) let\u2019s call her Mary and I haven\u2019t been close in the past but in recent years we\u2019ve grown more and more close, Mary has a full-time job and rarely can hangout but she used to make time for me so we\u2019d have sister dates or just hangout. My sisters are very close with each other and I\u2019m often left out, I have always wanted a friendship with them , people will constantly say \u201cit\u2019s just your age gap\u201d or \u201cyour relationship with them will change once your older\u201d But recently a new girl came into our life ( Kay, 17) within this year Kay has gotten really close to both of my sisters, the three of them acting more like sisters than I ever have with them, how is it that Kay gets the relationship I\u2019ve always wanted when we\u2019re so close in age, I know it\u2019s probably inferiority complex talking but I feel like Kay is taking my role of being a younger sister. Whats worse is my older sister Mary is now REALLY close with Kay, so those nights I used to spend with Mary to hang out are now filled with \u2018sorry Kay is coming over\u2019 or \u2018Kay and me just want to be together\u2019, but within this past week I found out that Kay might move in (no reason just bc), I was opposed, Kay is already taking a lot of the little time I have with Mary but now all of it will be gone, Mary usually takes us to church and on the drive home we talk, but if kay moves in I won\u2019t have that conversation or debrief of the week to help build my relationship with my sister, Kay will always be there. When I voiced this to my parents they were very upset, they said things like \u201cKay is just nicer and is kinder than you so it\u2019s easier to like her and be around her\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s because she\u2019s quiet\u201d. Obviously, I felt like shit even if it is true, I\u2019m their sister not Kay, I already feel insecure abt my relationship with my sisters and now a jab has been taken from my personality too?

            "body": "My boyfriend (25m) and I (24f) have been together for 6 years and just graduated uni yesterday. We moved to another country to study and will move back to our respective countries in a month. I don\u2019t know how to phrase this without sounding harsh but basically my bf doesn\u2019t know anything. He has cheated on every exam, every test for 6 years and somehow graduated\u2026because of me. I missed all my exams for him so I can help him copy instead (because I knew I could easily pass in the second attempt) and have been there for everything. Can\u2019t say the same for him but he has financially supported us (70-75%) for the past 3 years.  Now, I was responsible for the decor for the graduation and I asked him to be more involved too. He agreed. Unfortunately, he became too involved. The days leading up to the graduation he was just too busy and couldn\u2019t give me any time (for eg going for my grad dress, shoes shopping, helping me in the decor, etc) tbh I complained about it but didn\u2019t push much because I knew it\u2019s my fault by asking him to get more involved.  Yesterday at the graduation, he was asked to give a thankyou speech, he gave special thanks to his parents in his native language, thanked our dean and all that jazz and forgot me. I was expecting a modest \u201cand thanks (my name\u201d but nothing. It really deeply hurt me. I don\u2019t know why I even expected it at this point, I guess I hurt myself. His friend from the gym (who I\u2019ve never met) attended the ceremony and stayed back with us. So we had an awkward lunch with him and then went home. No celebration, no surprise, nothing. He knew I wanted to go to my favourite restaurant to celebrate but I guess he forgot to book a table.  So I silently wept most of the night. But I guess he broke me because this morning he tried to apologise and I broke down with lots of screaming, crying, name calling and reminding him of all that I\u2019ve done for 6 years. I guess I struck a nerve because he held my legs and cried/apologised but I just freed my legs and left. He couldn\u2019t follow me because he has a flight (he\u2019s going to the capital city with the dean to get all out batch\u2019s diplomas legalised) where he will stay for 2-3 days. I\u2019m going to move out in this time. AITA",

            "body": "AITAH for making my step moms life hell?\n\nI\u2019ll make this quick but I\u2019m M16 and I have a twin brother who I\u2019ll name Callum and my little sister who\u2019s 9, her name will be Ava. For our life it was just us and our father who we all love. He\u2019s made so many sacrifices for us and this September he will be going to college to be a lawyer. He\u2019s not the problem tho, his wife is. Two years ago my dad met this lady (Jane) and was head over heels for him. At the time my dad was finishing up high school that he missed due to me and my brother. After about 3 months Jane moved in and that\u2019s were all hell came loose. Callum is bisexual and has a boyfriend who we all love. When Jane moved in is also around the time we met Callum\u2019s boyfriend. Jane acted all kind and sweet towards callum and his bf but the next day when my dad left for school she screamed at him saying stuff like \u201cI will not have any *f slurs* in the house!\u201d After that me and callum were too scared to tell our dad about what she began to do. After weeks of this I was sick of it, I told Jane that if she called my brother that again, I would personally make her life hell. And she did\u2026now here we\u2019re I kinda become the asshole. Jane has beautiful blond hair which she loves so much, so one day when she wasn\u2019t home I switched her shampoo with this hair lost formula. She came out screaming asking who did this, I played dumb as she kept pulling hair out of her head. I was quite proud of myself for that. But she believed it was my brother who did that. She stormed over to my brother and grabbed him by the hair. She screamed at him over and over till my body actually reacted and I pulled her off him and yelled at her, telling her to get the f out of I\u2019ll call the cops. Jane said that there was no evidence but she was wrong. Callum had recorded the whole fight. So I called the cops and my dad, we finally told him what was happening and he was disappointed that we couldn\u2019t come to him about this. We filed a restraining order on jane and haven\u2019t seen her since. Also if your wondering where Ava was most this time I would tell her to stay in her room due to fear she would get hurt by Jane. I need to get that off my chest so thank you for reading",

            "body": "AITAH for cutting off my dads side of the family for being abusive? \n\nI am F now in my mid 20s and am trying to create a safer environment for myself which means cutting certain people off. I grew up with mainly my dads side of the family since they all live in the same town I live in. I\u2019m the youngest cousin/niece on this side of the fam so all of my cousins are older and their parents (my uncles and aunts) are like the respected grandparents of the family. Growing up they all hated me for some reason. I was just the annoying little kid they had to bring everywhere and they definitely made sure I knew that. If I needed homework help and said the teacher is just too hard their response would be \u201cit\u2019s not the teacher it\u2019s you! you\u2019re just dumb\u201d and then not even show me how to do the assignment. I would try to avoid going over to their house because every time I went over \u201cwhat are your grades looking like and gpa\u201d were the only things they wanted to know about me. And I didn\u2019t have the best grades to show so the amount of anxiety and fear I had every time my parents forced me to go over because they would remind me how \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get anywhere in life with those grades\u201d. Just for some perspective I had Bs and Cs. Fast forward to when I was 16, the treatment got worse because now college is around the corner and I needed to step it up in their eyes. An older male married cousin came to visit from a different country for the summer with his wife. This is everyone\u2019s favorite cousin. He saw how everyone including my parents treated me and used that to get close to me, groom me, then tried to rape me. In front of his 2year old son. I was terrified of him but I feared my parents more. I felt like everyone was going to blame me so I didn\u2019t say anything. 2 years later I told my parents because that cousin wouldn\u2019t stop messaging me after I had told him to leave me alone\u2026 my mom was devastated as she kept in touch with this cousin and had daily phone calls with him. She blocked him after. My dad on the other hand didn\u2019t care and went on living his life. Even went to their house and had a cup of tea and dinner while sitting with this cousin. Throughout the years I tried to tell more family members but no one believed me. Everyone thought it was probably a misunderstanding and I\u2019m making it a bigger deal than it is. My main concern was that my 16 year old niece lives with him. And I wanted to make sure she was safe. So I finally went to my last resort which was to tell the cousins who called me dumb my whole life. Convincing myself that we are adults now they won\u2019t talk to me that way anymore. But every time I went over to their house they would start FaceTiming the pedophile cousin. Finally at 24 years old I decided to tell one of them and chose to tell the one who is a psychiatrist thinking she\u2019d understand the situation better than anyone. I didn\u2019t go to her as a patient just to bring awareness that we have a pedopphile in the family let\u2019s watch out for it or let\u2019s do something about it. Her response was \u201cyou better not tell anyone about this not a single word, if my dad (my uncle) finds out he won\u2019t be able to handle this news and you\u2019ll end up killing him, I\u2019ll be so upset with you\u201d. I was taken aback now thinking I\u2019m the one in the wrong so I shut up about it for another year. Then one day I had enough and outed the pedophile cousin on my social media with actual photo evidence and a detailed description of what he did to me. Everyone was on my side except my family. Both of my uncles implied that I\u2019m a slut by saying \u201cwell if she wasn\u2019t so easy this wouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d there was also a \u201cyou know, life is too short to worry about this kind of stuff\u201d there\u2019s so much more but I don\u2019t want to type it all out. Long story short I cut my dads side of the family out of my life and I want nothing to do with them. But now they\u2019re talking shit about me by telling everyone that I\u2019ve ruined the family. I recently went to a friends party where the host\u2019s father (who has nothing to do with the situation) drunkenly started yelling at me about how I\u2019m ruining my family. In front of everyone. I kept my composure didn\u2019t blow up at him and just walked away and went home. I felt so humiliated. My dad was there too and just kept making the \u201che was just drunk\u201d excuse. My dad has also made me feel so bad for cutting his family out that I\u2019m starting to feel a bit guilty. My mom and sister have also cut them all offf in my support. AITAH for cutting them out? For ruining my family? For choosing my mental peace over theirs?",

            "body": "AITA for cutting off my friend after finding out him making multiple unwanted advances towards my friends. \nI\u2019m 21f and just completed my 2nd year of Uni. I made many friends during my time at uni and befriended Joe (21m) in my first year. Joe and I treated each other like siblings. We would bicker but have each others back. He would walk me home, comfort me when I was going through other stuff and was a great friend to me overall. I have a habit where I like mixing my circles. Before I get into the recent stuff, I\u2019ll explain some past detaiIs. I introduced Joe to many of my friends and they usually did hit it off. What I noticed during the last year was that every time I introduced or another friend introduced him to a new girl he would be interested in them. Last July, I introduce my uni friends to my friend Emily who is one of my closest friends from my high school years. Joe would make unwanted advances towards Emily but Emily outright rejected him. Joe also asked me for permission for him to make moves on her but before he could even finish his sentence I said no as I knew that Emily is not interested and would feel very uncomfortable. I thought that was it and that everyone moved on but Emily started declining my invitation to go out for months and a month later she told me why as she didn\u2019t want to give me anymore excuses as to why she doesn\u2019t want to go out with me and my friends anymore. Emily told me every time she was out with us that Joe would touch her inappropriately and try to isolate her from everyone. I was shocked to hear this as I couldn\u2019t see Joe as someone that I couldn\u2019t trust. For a few weeks I was wondering what to do as Emily told me not to tell anyone. My friend Maria who was also a close friend of Joe spoke to me about how Joe made one of Maria\u2019s friend very uncomfortable. I told her I\u2019ve been hearing something similar too. Afterwards one by one many girls came forward about Joe making them feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Emily then gave more details of what she was experiencing with Joe and it clicked that Joe was sexually harassing many of my friends. I felt awful that I wasn\u2019t as observant and regretted introducing him to them.A few friends and I decided to speak to him and this didn\u2019t turn out good as he started crying and made us worry that he was going to do something stupid to himself. He ran way and turned off his snap maps, luckily he was convinced to go to the hospital. We all started feeling guilty and felt like bad friends. I spoke to him on the phone as it felt right to let him speak for himself. I told him that I\u2019ll always be thankful for our friendship and wish him all the best but for me to be a good friend to Emily and the other girls I feel like I need to cut him off. I told him to give me a few weeks for me to make a decision but I ended up giving him my answer with silence. I told myself to do what\u2019s right and I decided to cut him off. Maria still kept in contact with him due to feeling guilty as he lost his whole friendship group but regrets this decision as he calls her in the middle of the night to talk shit about me and friends and uses up her emotional energy. He\u2019s been telling her that he Wants revenge by spreading petty lies that nobody would\u2019ve cared about. Making comments about him know who his \u2018real ones\u2019 are. I found out recently that he has also talked shit about my mum which made me furious since she got him an interview at her workplace but the manager of the establishment ended up in the hospital which delayed Joe\u2019s training. Joe assumed that the reason the manager wasn\u2019t getting back to him quickly was because of my mum. Not sure what to do from here as I don\u2019t mind him spreading stuff about me as much but i feel as though he\u2019s directing his anger for me at my mum. I wish he could move on and leave us alone. Honestly this isn\u2019t even all of it. I made this post so long already. Thank you for reading.",

            "body": "AITA If I don\u2019t play the remains half of my son\u2019s/bd\u2019s headstone\n\nPosting on here because it\u2019s too long for r/aita \nThrowaway account for privacy.\n\nThis a kinda complicated so bare with me. My toddler died this summer in an accident in my care. My bd and I had been broken up due to domestic violence months prior and the state set up an automatic protection order against him. (I\u2019d let his mom pick up our son for every weekend) Our mutual friend/ former coworker to both of us, set up a gofundme advertise for funeral expenses ONLY. \n\nAt first my bd tried to go behind my back and told our friend let\u2019s call her Gabby. That any donations from his friends, family, coworkers on his side should go directly to him. Saying most of the donations are for him. (They we\u2019re mostly from my grandmothers community and my friends) This happened before the funeral. Thankfully Gabby let me know right away, so she were to be able to check who donated what even anonymously. Though most of the people who do it anonymously for religious reasons, which is upsetting we had to check due his entitlement.\nBut once we told him we\u2019ll be contacting every person who donated, to ask them where would they like their money to go to. He dropped it and we both agreed that Gabby can be the third party and write out checks for funeral and burial costs. And any left over costs would be switched evenly between us, so we can buy memorial pieces for ourselves.\n\nWell around 6 weeks after the funeral. I rang up Gabby asking if there\u2019s any left over gofundme money, and she revealed that she wrote up a check to the funeral directly a week before the funeral. Which I had no idea about, but since we were having issues with the mail the for months. Waiting for a check my grandpa donated for the funeral. I started asking questions because I was afraid it got lost in the mail. Since the funeral home never contacted me about receiving a check.\n\nShe revealed that my Bd came to her a week before the funeral saying the funeral home needed the check asap or we couldn\u2019t have a funeral. (Even though the deposit was already paid by a Childloss/grief organizations donation). So I called up the funeral home asking if they received the check, they said no. So I had then sent me an itemized bill of what was donated and from who. It only shown my grandpa, the organization, and my baby daddy. He only paid over $1000 for the rest of the cost, even though we had gotten around $4500 from gofundme.\n\nGabby tried reaching out to my bd and he didn\u2019t answer, so I went to reach out. Only to find out I was blocked on Facebook & Text. When I wasn\u2019t blocked the day before. And his mother blocked me shortly after the funeral which I thought was weird at the time. But I was too busy grieving the first month to care.\n\nAt this point I was so mad that I posted the funeral invoice on my story to accuse him as a thief and if someone doesn\u2019t get him to contact by the next day I\u2019ll be informing the police. Since we have bank statements showing he changed it to the order of himself instead of handing it to the funeral home directly like he told Gabby he was gonna do.\n\nWe ended up talking and after we finished arguing he said he\u2019s was going to use the rest for the burial and tombstone. Even though I already got a plague from my neighbor who made it for free for us. But he refused to take it. And before this gofundme drama. He even tried to excluded me from our own son\u2019s burial and not give me a date or address because his family doesn\u2019t like me. And that the burial was at his family plot. So he got a tombstone that is a shared one between our son and him, because he wants to be buried with our son when he dies. (To put some more context. The funeral home split our son\u2019s ashes and hair between us so we both have half for ourselves and our family members ) he said he\u2019ll get back to me with receipts for the tombstone and burial.\n\nAfter that I deleted my story and made a new one retracting what I said about being a thief but still acknowledged he should\u2019ve never put the check in his account and left it with our third party like we both agreed in the first place. \n\nNow his mom and himself has sent the receipt, today. Showing he had to pay over $1000 out of pocket. And he wants me to split it with him. I don\u2019t mind splitting the burial for my son. I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019d be the asshole for not splitting the tombstone? Since I got one with only our son\u2019s name, dates, and picture. That I offered for him to use. But he refused and he got a tombstone that has our son\u2019s name and date but also his own name on it as well.\n\nI don\u2019t want things to get messy, since everything because an argument with him. And it was so draining to plan the funeral with him because he\u2019d argue over any decision and would even try to argue about our relationship when we\u2019re supposed to focus on grieving and honoring our child. So I want some opinions what you\u2019d think is fair. If I have to save up for the half he wants me to pay I will, in order to no longer deal with him and his family\u2019s narcissism. Especially since their the type to threaten to sue over everything. Like reposting a narcissism post, sharing your story without using names for defamation. \n\nSince I know someone\u2019s gonna ask we live in America.",

            "body": "AITA for causing absolute chaos? I, (49M) woke up. I went up the stairs of my basement and walked into the kitchen. I greeted my wife (17F) and grabbed hot pockets from the freezer. As I began to place the hot pockets into the microwave, I asked her what the kids (8M) (7M) were doing. She replied, \"oh they're upstairs playing something.\" \"What are they playing?\" I replied. \"I don't know, For-\" I grabbed her and screamed at her. \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY PLAYING???\" she sobbed \"i- i don't know i last saw them playing fo-\" I slammed her into the ground. I let out a battle cry. I grabbed a can of monster energy and stormed upstairs. As I ran I chugged the monster energy down so I could keep moving. I ran into the room with the TV and console. They didn't hear me as they had headphones. I looked at the tv. I screamed. They were playing Fortnite. I threw the can of monster energy at my son's (7M) head. He yelled out. I stormed towards him, grabbed him, and slammed him into the tv, breaking it. I grabbed the console. His brother (8M) screamed and cried and tried to run to the door, but before he reached it I threw the console at him. He screamed and fell, and I began to beat him with one of the controllers lying around. It smashed into pieces and I began using my hands. I slammed my buff right arm into him until he stopped crying and moving and his chest stopped rising. I turned to his brother, (7M) who was on the floor crying. I picked him up. He begged for mercy. \"NO MERCY FOR PLAYING THAT FUCKING GAME YOU LITTLE SHIT! FOR ANTIWORK!\" I slammed him down into the floor. I began to pound him with my fist in the nose. While hitting him I began to hear sirens. Fuck. It's them. That fucking piece of shit must have called them. I charged downstairs, son still in hand and screaming, and ran out the door. Police cars were lined infront of the house. My wife was sitting in an ambulance at the end of the street. Officers aimed their weapons at me. \"Put the child down now!\"  \nI could hear more sirens in the distance. \"FUCK YOU PIG!\" I screamed. I quickly slammed down my son, headfirst, into the street, caving his head in. \"FOR GENZEDONG!\" I charged toward the officers. They opened fire on me, bullets ripping into my fat belly. I roared out. I retreated back into the house. I remembered my hot pockets were in the microwave. I went to grab them. They were cold as it had been 10 minutes since I heated them. I stuffed them into my mouth and tucked the rest under my triple chin. 2 cops (32M) (26M) with shotguns ran into the house and fired at me. I roared as the shells slammed into my fat at 1200 ft per second. I charged them and they retreated screaming. I quickly grabbed extra doritos and monster energy and charged outside. I roared loud. Police cars were flooding the streets around my house as bullets flew into me. I moved on forward absorbing the bullets. I turned to where the ambulance was parked. It sped forward with a police escort. I roared and smashed through 2 police cars, smashing the leg of an officer (27M), and got into one of the cars. I munched down some hot pockets to heal the dozens of bullet wounds in me and put the car into drive. I ran over a random squirrel (4M) and sped to the ambulance. However, the car began to screech against the street as my weight was pushing it down. I continued. A helicopter flew over me. The car slammed down into the ground completely as the wheels were destroyed, and I slammed into a minivan (Honda Odyssey)with a family inside it at 38 MPH. The car then slammed into a house and crushed someone (72F). A swat truck and 6 police cars stopped next to the crash site. Dozens of rounds from the M4s the swat team had flew into me. I could feel my energy going down. I reached for hot pockets, but realized I lost them. I screamed out and cried. 17 police officers pinned me down and chained my hands and legs.  \nIt's been 2 weeks. The governor (54M) lifted the ban on the death penalty and I am going to be executed with 38,000 volts of electricity. I think this is unfair and my actions are completely justified.  \nSo Reddit, AITAH?",

            "body": "Who is the AH?\n\nI (F24) and my (ex) (M27) were dating on and off for 2 years, this last time together was over a year consistently. Around Christmas time we started getting more serious, he started meeting my family, I started meeting his, etc. we obviously spent the holidays together and we were really starting to become close knit. \n\nThere were things done in the past during our non consistent period together that were a bit sketchy, (he was talking to his ex), and then told me I was crazy for being mad about it then broke up with me. 2 months later, we rekindled and he said he had missed me and wanted to talk again. \n\nFor context, (maybe this is crazy), but I texted 2 of his exes to find out why they broke up, etc. of course they admitted to his pathological lying, cheating, manipulation, and narcissism. Of course I took what they said with a grain of salt. I hadn\u2019t known him back at the points he was dating other people and he had told me his exes were \u201cman eaters\u201d and they were the ones who cheated and lied, so of course I believed him. \n\nBack to Christmas time (2022). I felt so genuinely loved and cared for. This was the first time he had told me he loved me, I was overjoyed. I was so happy he had felt love with me. I was over the moon.  Well a couple months later I had a gut feeling that he was lying about something. I have horrible anxiety and it\u2019s like a 6th sense of mine and I felt like I had to snoop, so I did. I found out he was sexting multiple girls.. 3 days before he told me he \u201cloved me\u201d and CONTINUED to do it until that point I snooped. OF COURSE he felt \n\u201cguilty\u201d and begged for me to not leave him. This was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen this man cry, genuinely shed tears bc he was just sooo heartbroken. I ended up forgiving him, blah blah blah. \n\nFast forward to recently, I just bought a house and have been wanting to fix it up. I asked him to move in with me, asked him to help fix it up, his opinions on things for the house, genuinely wanted to get him involved and make him feel like this was his house too. I asked him to help with the backsplash and redo it. He told me, \u201cI think you\u2019re wasting your money\u201d of course I was upset bc I bought this house for us to grow and have a future family together here and make it look nice for future when we choose to sell and get a bigger house. I wanted the house done and he hadn\u2019t lived with me yet because he always made excuses to why he couldn\u2019t move in \u201cjust yet.\u201d Well instead because he didn\u2019t wanna help me I asked my (M28) friend to do it for me because he does it for a living. I offered to pay him and pay for the materials, I just needed someone to do it. We were never at my home together, I was normally at work or staying with my (ex)boyfriend for the night. There were only a couple instances my friend and I were at the house together. We were friends well before my boyfriend and I had been together. He also knew I had a boyfriend. One night I was gone and babysitting for a neighbor and I come home to find my bf searching through my watch. He said \u201che knew something was up\u201d he read 3 conversations with 3 male friends (one including a nurse that works at my job bc I work in healthcare) they were friendly, civil, and not romantic at all, but then told me I was emotionally cheating on him because I had talked to 3 different males and \u201clet one into my home\u201d while yes I owned up to the fact it may seem somewhat disrespectful to my boyfriend, I never saw a huge problem with it because he was just a friend helping me out. Long story short my boyfriend broke up with me over it. He said he couldn\u2019t trust me at all. Now mind you I\u2019ve never given him reason to think I was ever cheating. (Was literally in love with this man) so I obviously didn\u2019t delete the messages because I was never afraid that he\u2019d think I was cheating. I had no concern with him going through my phone or my Apple Watch, but here we are. I\u2019m labeled a cheater, when I didn\u2019t actually cheat. \n\nSo AITA for asking for for help from a male friend when my boyfriend wouldn\u2019t? \n\nThanks for reading if you stuck around this long!!",

Typically viewing porn is because of a lack in being sexual with your significant other so that might be a good place to think. If it is because of a lack of sexual contact to not blame your significant other and explain how an increase in that would decrease the undesired behavior. People get married and then can\u2019t understand why a spouse cheats in a sexless marriage. Having sexual contact is a big part of a relationship for most men. Now people should learn to be adults and have the hard discussions and if things haven\u2019t been resolved they should end the relationship rather than cheat. Now this talking and resolution part should be tried for years before giving up on a marriage but maybe not so much for a BF and GF relationship because you haven\u2019t made that commitment yet.",

            "body": "I am a 16-year-old girl and I have been in an extremely toxic friend group for 5 years meaning I have been friends with the group since 6th grade. This friend group consists of two girls and around 7 guys. New people have joined along the way and left but mostly the group has stayed the same besides a 17-year-old boy, a grade above the rest of us, who joined the group last year. I have so many amazing memories with this group but they are also the cause of all my mental health issues. They say unimaginable things to me including body shaming me and telling me to kill myself. This happens frequently and has only gotten worse as we grew up. I avoid the confrontations and try to convince myself it's normal because I care for this group so much and I always have fun with them when they aren't being rude to me. The highs are high and the lows are so low. About 6 months ago I liked one of the guys in the group and he seemed to like me back. This ended up going nowhere and it has become the joke of the group as I liked him for a lot longer than he liked me. He didn't really care much about me the whole time but I was pretty delusional about the whole thing. Fast forward to the present time I have stopped liking him but the jokes still prevail. The jokes are not lighthearted or funny either. They are malicious and cruel. They joke about me being too ugly and fat/flat for him. They do not hold back ever and are extremely cruel to me. The group members are all pretty toxic as they talk shit about everyone but me and the grade older guy who joined our group last year. For this story, we will call him Harry. Harry and two other guys from the group were extremely close and were like a trio within the group. Me and the other girl from our group have always been very close friends and we began to hang out with the trio frequently as I found them to be much nicer and respectful, they were still pretty toxic. The other girl however got along better with the boys who were so rude to me and this always rubbed me the wrong way but I do not judge her much for it, she can be friends with who she wants. I began to distance myself from the really rude boys and get closer to the trio, staying close friends with the other girl the entire time. We will call this other girl Chloe. Today the group got into a big argument with Chloe and was rude to her but not to the same level they attacked me. It was more lighthearted and funny. Chloe found this funny but it rubbed me the wrong way because I felt like they were making fun of her deeper than they chose to show. Chloe is a little chubby and has always been and these boys often talked badly about her because of this behind her back. I would never want Chloe to be hurt so I always defend her and respect her nonetheless (as I should). This should be the bare minimum in a friendship I feel. Somehow the argument got shifted towards me and I started getting attacked. They were calling me ugly, fat, flat, worthless, and much more. Telling me to kill myself and to go to the gym. I know I am not fat but this really hurt because I am insecure and this summer has been pretty depressing for me. John decided to join the argument and started telling me to lower my standards calling me ugly and rating me a 4/10. The group then asked me to rate him out of 10 but I knew that he struggled with his self-image before as he is not conventionally attractive in any way and most would say he is ugly. Instead of rating him I simply said no and explained that I do not like to make people feel bad about themselves for no reason. I then privately chatted with John explaining that I did not want to hurt his feelings because of his past issues with his self-image. A while ago John had explained to me that he used to be suicidal because of this group's toxicity. John half-swiped my messages and did not answer but instead texted in the group chat that I was privately texting him and they all began calling me a pussy. I got angry at this combined with all the rude comments from earlier and said that I was private messaging him because I didn't think he would want the rest of the group chat to know that he was suicidal. After this, all hell broke loose and I instantly realized what I had done. The group chat attacked me even more and then began to make fun of John. I apologized to John privately and explained that he was being really mean to me and I got angry and said it and that I knew it was very wrong. I had a panic attack and have been crying all day over it. I never want to talk to the rude boys again because they went way too far but I want to preserve my friendship with the trio including John and also with Chloe who is wholeheartedly on my side about everything. I have been laying in bed crying all day and sending John apologies but he feels that he can't forgive me even though he understands why I said it and still will remain friends with me. I know I am an awful person for what I said and it was beyond wrong but I do feel that John was very out of line in his comments towards me as well. AITA for telling my toxic friend group that my friend John was suicidal?",

After that, I had to get her out because she was lying, cheating in college and stealing from us. She made my family suffer terribly and I feel so bad I let this happen. \nMind you: this sister of mine, used to beat me and cut my clothes with knives when I was young teenager. She destroyed my entire room and then throw me out at 15 and put her boyfriend in my room. I still have flashbacks. \nAnyways, being that my sister is borderline and niece too. \nMy niece called me and said that her drug selling boyfriend ( let\u2019s call him Andrew, for now) was choking her. I begged her mom to save her daughter but she said no. I went to save her, her boyfriend, cut me with scissors, knocked out my tooth, broke my wrist, then went into the back room to get a gun. I called 911, the police came, found 10 lbs of pot but no gun ( he hide it). Then they both lied and said, the marks on her neck were from a wild sex act. Then I noticed the stolen paintings she took from my sons room ($900). The \u201cAndrew\u201d person cut them up too. \n\nSo I was arrested, 55 year old housewife for entering their apartment after knocking 3 times to check on my niece. So life is not fair, I have been fighting this criminal offense for 2 years. My older borderline personality sister, ( let\u2019s call her Chris) refuses to help me. Her daughter refused to tell the truth. Mind you, this is her third beating from him. It has destroyed my life! I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \nAdvice please, I have attempted to end things 2 times and screwed that up. My life is over !",

We don\u2019t make a lot of money but we make enough to cover everything. Then one day he woke me up and told me he has something special for us. I knew something was weird because he never makes plans himself unless we plan together or it\u2019s a special day but today was just a random Saturday. We went to dinner and then to the park to watch the sunset until he got up and went on one knee. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a box. I was really excited because we have been ready to get married and have children to have a family together. When he opened the box I saw the ring and instantly thought it was familiar until I noticed it is the same one he used for his past relationship. How did I know it was that ring? Because about 3 years ago when we moved together, I was helping him pack his apartment. I went to pack his socks and when I moved one of the pairs and saw a ring box. I was curious so I opened it and saw a ring. Later that week we were spending the night at my house and decided to bring it up because I knew I wasn\u2019t ready. He told me that it wasn\u2019t for me and that it was the ring for his past relationship and she said no to the proposal which is when they ended things. He forgot about the ring and just remembered about it. He so me he was going to return it very soon. Turns out he never returned it. I said no to the proposal and told him that I was going to stay with my parents and think about things. I decided I think we should end it and at times I felt like I was exaggerating.

Is it perhaps okay if I mark it as 'hypothetical' or 'fictional', not okay if it's unmarked, or bad either way?\n\nPart of my confusion stems from the fact that the reddit's description includes that we could make a post about Scar from the Lion King... so before I read the full set of rules, I'd have imagined that bringing in scenarios from works of fiction (\"AITA that I made my nephew believe he caused his father's death when in fact I was the one who I did?\") would have been ok.",

I'm a little young to write, but I need advice! I grew up with this guy (15m) from Kindergarten to Grade 9 (He moved to another school for grade 10). We are practically neighbours but have never really hung out. Sometimes we would use Snapchat to talk but he's pretty quiet. We were friends in school too, and he's always been cute and attractive.  \nStory: I had a concert to attend, and he came along to watch it because his friends were also involved. After the concert, I was chatting with my friends, and we greeted each other, but it never went further than that. The next day, he apologized for not talking to me and said that he was busy chatting with his friends. I was surprised, but I didn't think about it much. We started talking on Snapchat (I know, what's wrong with my generation), and we continued talking for almost three hours about everything. The following day, we didn't talk much, but he started saying goodnight and good morning for the next few days. Just yesterday, he asked a cheesy question if I found anyone cute. I was nervous and tired, so I kept changing the subject. I knew what he was getting at, he wanted me to call him cute, and I did, which wasn't a lie. He said I was too, we kept talking and he kept saying it. I feel bad for saying this but it was a bit awkward, but of course Snapchat is like a mask so he couldn't tell. Then he said that he liked me. I was so taken aback and surprised that I didn't know what to do so I said it back. I've never been with someone before so I was confused and didn't know what to do. I know most of you know teens who already go to parties, have boyfriends, and have sex but that's not me right now. I feel like it's going too fast, I wonder if I like him, and I can't reject him. Another important piece of information is, that he's had a girlfriend. I don't know when they broke up but I want to make sure I'm not his rebound. Totally Teenager problems but they feel as big as the ones that you probably have! I feel like it's going too fast, and I hope he won't ask me to be his Girlfriend soon because the answer will be \"no\". The reason is, it's going too fast. I haven't seen him since the concert and I want to, it's just he says he's always busy. I hope he will make time for me. I know I'm overthinking this, maybe it's \"whoremones\" lol. However, I do need other people's opinions and advice on what to say or do. If you have any questions comment, and I will give an update as soon as something happens.",

You never need to apologize for normal considerations about who you want to have an intimate role in your life. These aren\u2019t \u201cwhoremones\u201d and no such thing exists. You also don\u2019t need to apologize for your communication tools as a younger generation. We all have different stuff available in each decade, as long as you like communicating that way and don\u2019t feel pushed into it by others when you\u2019d rather connect in person, it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\n3. It sounds like you really just want to know this guy a little more than you do before you make a commitment to be his partner/decide if you even want to keep up flirting. That\u2019s good! Perhaps suggest meeting up in person for a hang if you\u2019re interested in seeing where this goes? If he resists a lot, then he can\u2019t be that serious about the whole thing in which case, why become his gf? Make sure you feel that you\u2019ve had time to get to know him and if you like him. Just like your gut is telling you rn! If you find out you dont, you can just let him know you\u2019re not really interested but like being friends (if you like being friends). It\u2019s more simple than you think to tell someone it\u2019s just not really doing it for ya. \n\nFinally, when you really like someone: it\u2019s super obvious! If you\u2019re not feeling it, you either haven\u2019t got to know them or you just don\u2019t really like them. If you get to know him better and still feel on the fence, you\u2019re definitely just not into him.\n\nGood luck!",

This coworker, I\u2019ll call her L (30F), and I were pretty cool. We started off rocky but one day things just switched and we were work besties. \n  L was telling me about how two of her kids live across the country because she\u2019s an alcoholic and she only has her third because she lives with her mom. \n  One day L starts fighting with our manager, I\u2019ll call him Tom(27M). The busboy, O(36M) heard them arguing and told Tom to back off. Tom and O got arguing in another language and they moved into the kitchen where Tom beat the ever-living sh*t out of O. \n  Some of the customers called the cops and they came. Tom decided he wasn\u2019t done and beat up O again and O quit. Tom stopped giving L tables for the rest of the day.\n  I was dating O at the time and when he quit L asked me for his number. I thought that was weird because she knew we were dating. I asked why. She said \u201cI want to thank O for sticking up for me today. I wanted to take him to a bar for some drinks.\u201d I never responded and left it at that because why do you want to take MY boyfriend to a bar when you\u2019re supposed to be sober? Also, O doesn\u2019t speak English. I speak his language which is how we communicate. L couldn\u2019t talk to him at all unless it was through a translator app. \n   L stayed at our job for a few days and she had been kind of sh*tty with me but I assumed that she was just miserable. I chalked it up to having a bad week and kind of steered clear. \n  A few days later L quits. Up until this point we were texting daily and talking all day (aside from the last few days) so when she quit I texted her a few times. Just your normal \u201chey I hope you\u2019re okay. Good luck at your new job!\u201d Stuff like that. L never responded to my first 3 texts that were spanned out over a 2 day period so I never reached out again. \n  Last week she comes back. I\u2019m excited to see her so I\u2019m like \u201cHey, L! Oh my god it\u2019s so nice to see you!\u201d And she responds positively but she doesn\u2019t seem like she really wants to talk so I leave her alone. Later on in our shift I see that she\u2019s miserable again and she\u2019s alienating herself so I ask \u201chey, L, are you alright?\u201d And she says \u201cI was up until today and I don\u2019t want to f*cking talk about it so don\u2019t f*cking ask\u201d and she walks away from me. I try to figure out what I\u2019ve done to upset her but I don\u2019t know. Our next shift together I ask her \u201cHey, L, are you feeling better today?\u201d And she says in the most b*tchy tone I\u2019ve ever heard \u201cI\u2019m fine. Are you? Why the f*ck are you asking if I\u2019m okay?\u201d And I decided at that point that I was done trying to be nice to her. \n  This might be a good time to point out that I\u2019m autistic (I found out a few months ago) so I don\u2019t really read social cues well and up until this point I had just thought she was having bad days. It\u2019s at this point that she starts making comments about how she\u2019s doing all the side work (we have a sheet and I did my assigned stuff.) I\u2019m not going to help you do yours if you\u2019re going to treat me like sh*t. So I told her I did my side work and she has to do hers. \n  Later on in the night we get a dinner rush so as I\u2019m in the kitchen bringing out food she comes to me and says \u201cyour table keeps asking me for sh*t. You\u2019re not even busy there\u2019s no excuse for it\u201d and I just said okay and went to take care of my table. I\u2019m not good with confrontation. It makes me cry. So at this point I\u2019m shaking but I go and take care of it.\n  Our next shift together was yesterday. 8-2. I figure, alright, 6 hours with L can\u2019t be that bad. She bumps into me 3 separate times yesterday. Each time SHE bumps into ME and goes \u201cow\u201d really loud to draw attention to it. I go on about my business. I\u2019m trying not to get upset because I\u2019ll shake and I might cry. The third time she bumps into me she yells \u201cstop bumping into me\u201d and I\u2019m so mad by this point. Shes been bullying me for almost 2 weeks. I turn around and yell \u201cwatch where you\u2019re f*cking going\u201d and she leaves the kitchen. During the rest of our shift she keeps making comments about how I need to do this or I\u2019m not doing this right etc. I\u2019ve been a server for 8 years. I know how to do my job. Before I left she said something about how I should be fired and I don\u2019t know how to do my job so I turn and say \u201cI don\u2019t argue with b*tches who don\u2019t take care of their kids\u201d and she started crying and went to the back of the kitchen. I feel bad about it. I feel like I took it too far. But at the same time I also feel like she deserved it? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t go to work to be bullied I go to work to do my job.

What makes you an asshole is your acting on those feelings in negative ways that injure others.\n\n--If you're cheating on a partner, YTA.  That includes emotional affairs. It doesn't matter what your partner did or did not do - it never justifies cheating. \n\n--If someone was an AH to you, YTA for doing an assholish thing back to them in revenge or retaliation.   Two wrongs don't make a right.  Someone else being an AH to you does not justify you being an AH back to them. \n\n--Another person's choice of wardrobe or clothing being offensive to you does not justify you being an AH to them.   \n\n--Another person's poor etiquette towards you does not justify your poor etiquette towards them.\n\n--Just because you feel something or get offended by something doesn't give you the right to vomitpuke your emotions all over whatever's offended you.   YTA when  you do that.",

He proceeds to say: \u201cI\u2019m tired of y\u2019all\u2019s bulls***, none of you are friends except for UL(that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna call him), you\u2019re just acquaintances that I don\u2019t really care for. So we all said \u201cDamn I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t know you were god, my bad\u201d(3 people said something similar to this) so a few days pass and we\u2019re back in school( we went back on Tuesday idrk why) he no longer sits with us, being a major dick type of stuff. I think Wednesday morning he texts in the gc and says \u201chey do y\u2019all wanna hang out on my birthday\u201d(he literally didn\u2019t respond to anyone the day before) so he comes back around on Wednesday, then Thursday a girl ( well call her AC) says \u201c Wow DM(another friend) got a serious glow up)\n\nThere\u2019s some context behind this: in 7th grade AC and DM went to a dance, last year in 9th, E and AC talked(no beef between DM and E) so E says \u201cthat\u2019s a lot coming from you about an ex, especially when you have a bf\u201d\n\nThen EVERYBODY got pissed, except for UM, anyways E is ignoring all of us(in the gc) and we\u2019re supposed to hang out next Saturday, so AITAH for not wanting to hang out with a guy who has wronged everyone in my friend group.",

I had to drive back to my apartment to pay rent from girlfriend's. See, the landlord lives on the property and I find it more convenient just to hand him the check in person. So I write one out, walk down to the end of the property where has this sign that says \"Put mail in slot\". Which can be a bit confusing, but the old mailbox was built into the wall and has since been sealed shut. Instead, there is a small metal panel that operates on a hinge beneath the door handle that you press the envelope to. So I slide it through there and hurry off to work. Traffic wasn't particularly bad on the 110 but it still took me like 45 minutes so now I'm barely on time. All morning I'm just lost in spreadsheets and phone calls about meaningless shit. Honestly I can't even remember the details, but then about 1 PM I took lunch and checked my phone. Still no messages and nobody has contacted me since this morning. I send a couple texts and leave my phone to charge on the table, walk off to the restroom. Minutes later I return, the phone right where I left it. I do have some messages now but I don't check them because I'm responsible with my time at work. I spend the rest of it alternating between measuring things with a scale ruler and writing down what they are which is still a human job in the 21st century. I get out of there around 6, don't say a word to anyone just head right for my car. Drive back to the apartment, traffic is fucking terrible now. It takes me ages. Turns out the 110 is closed at the 405 because some asshole has scattered the debris that used to be his automobile across 4 perfectly good lanes and now we're all parked on the freeway watching two ambulances and a couple cop cars lighting the stage for a performance of a drama I didn't really appreciate having a front row ticket to. I show up back at the apartment late, I'm fucking hungry and in a bad mood. I ate an entire block of mozzarella cheese. AITA?",

            "body": "Hi Redditors, hope all of you are doing great. Approximately 5 months ago I created a post seeking for advice and to be honest, I got good advice and thankyou for that. Just wanted to post and update because.....bleh! Long story short, I (26F) ended friendship with my very very close friend Patrick (26M) after he kept on flirting with me despite me telling him several times that I am not comfortable with his flirt and he needs to stop.\r  \n\r  \nnow, here is the update. So, I took advice from you guys and called Patrick. I explained the whole situation to him and told him what he was doing was wrong and I need time and space, so I need to cut contact with him for the time being. He understood me completely and behaved well for whole 5 days. On day 6, he started spamming my phone. So much that I had to put my phone on flight mode for an entire day and eventually had to block him the next day. The messages were mostly about reminding me of our good times together and how important we are for each other and how much I mean to him. After blocking him, I though that was it. But oh boy I couldn't be more wrong. After a week or so, I got a message on instagram at 2 am at night from an unknown ID. It was a picture of MY HOUSE. Yess, and the voice message said I'm standing in front of your house, please talk to me. Some of the voice messages were blank. I instantly recognised the drunk voice of Patrick. there were literally 40-45 voice messages. So I didn't bother to listen to each one of them. i listened to top few and then the last two messages in which he mentioned that he'd die without me so i should talk to him (implicating self harm). Now, the good thing was I sleep at 11 pm and I don't check my phone as first thing in the morning. So, I saw all these messages in the afternoon. I instantly blocked the ID. My best friend Seth (24M) lives right across Patrick. So, I told him everything and Seth had a conversation with Patrick. It's been 3 months and I didn't get a call or text or anything from Patrick. Seth told me Patrick's family is seeking brides for Patrick. We live in a country where arrange marriages are pretty common. So, that's that. I hope Patrick gets his senses back. Thankyou for listening reddit. I hope you have an amazing year ahead",

            "body": "Aita for going out with my friends? Just for context I f(17) and my boyfriend m(17) are in a relationship since over two years. Ive recently lost a lot of my friends but that is another story. My boyfriend and I broke up once for 2 months and it was an ugly break up. It was summer last year and even though i asked him if we could stay in contact to maybe reunite one day. Well we lost contact and I was partying a lot in the time we broke up. I also was quite popular with guys but no one was really serious. With that I just mean that we kinda used them go get free drinks. By the way we live in Europe so we can go partying when we turn 16!! Now back to the story. Two days ago my boyfriend got into a really heavy fight with his dad. His dad has anger-issues and well I think you can imagine ow it ended. My boyfriend got grounded and on that day I had a ticket for the club. Me and my friends planned on going there for 1 or 2 weeks. Of course I wanted to go to my boyfriend but aparrently his dad took his phone and read our whole chat. I just felt really violated and really didn\u2019t want to see his family because there was a lot of private stuff. Well i changed myself and I went to a friend where we drinking some shots and her parents drove us to the club. I told my boyfriend that I wont be texting as much as I usually do, because well I am outside with my friends and not just at a little get together with friends. At like 10:15 pm the club opened and we went to the wardrobe which took another 5 to 10 minutes. We sat down as a group and ordered some shots and drinks. At first we just talked and at like 11 pm we went upstairs to get some fresh air. Just so you know in the club basement was not signal so I couldn\u2019t text my boyfriend. When we went upstairs I got tons of messages from him. He was mad at me that his messages didn\u2019t come through. He tried to guilt trip me by saying stuff like: \u201cThank you for making my life worse that it already is\u201c or \u201c I hate you right now, while my life is being ruined you go out with your friends\u201c. I just felt so overwhelmed because the last time I texted him was at 9:30 pm. For context I sent him an outfitcheck because he once told me, that my fit checks brighten his day and because he had a rough day I wanted to make him happy by sending a fit check. I WAS SO WRONG. He didn\u2019t tell me I look pretty or something like that. He just asked: \u201cYour skirt can\u2019t be much shorter right\u201c and i knew that he was annoyed. So I told him fuck you. Now he is pissed that I said fuck you to him and I am pissed that he is treating me like this. So I want to know AITA?",

But to start, I want to address just a couple things and get y'all's thoughts. So, I had this friend, who I didn't see a whole lot while she was in college understandably so since we went to different schools. Not really friends with her anymore, but this is stuff that's leading up to it. She moved back into town after graduation and we started hanging out again. If I make a post, I'll go into more detail ab some of the things that gave me red flags. But, she would 'joke' about being a hoe and being a hater. For some context, I'm on the autism spectrum, I've struggled with sarcastic jokes for my entire life. But, I feel like I have gotten better at masking and picking up on social cues over the years and the way she would say these things just did not seem like jokes. She would particularly talk negatively ab people's lives from her HS a lot, like trouble they've gotten into or life choices (ie getting married and/or having kids). This always bothered me, but I never brought it up to her until we had our falling out. I realize that was wrong, I tend to try to be a people pleaser so I just wouldn't really say anything when she brought that stuff up, but I realize that's led to built up/bottled up frustration. Anyway, when I brought it up during our falling out, she was like 'well, being a hoe is a life choice, isn't it'? And like yeah, but I never judged her for that, which I didn't really get to say because there was a lot of other things we were talking about, but I did say I just took her at her word when she would joke about it bc a lot of girls do that kinda thing in college. I guess I just wanted to ask if I'm stupid for not picking up that she was joking about being a hoe and a hater? Prob gonna delete this at some point bc I'm pretty sure she uses Reddit",
