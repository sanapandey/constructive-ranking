    "selftext": "I (24F) went to a concert last weekend with my friend Jess (24F). We were both super excited since it was one of our favorite artists, and I was the one who got the tickets. I even drove us there, which was about an hour away.\n\nThe plan was simple: stick together, have fun, and go home together.\n\nWell, Jess had other ideas.\n\nAs soon as we got inside, she spotted a group of random people she knew from college. She immediately ditched me to go hang with them. I figured she\u2019d just say hi and come back, but no\u2014she fully disappeared for over an hour.\n\nI texted her multiple times asking where she was, and she kept replying, \u201cI\u2019m with friends! You should come find us!\u201d Which\u2026 no. We came together, and she just left me alone in a crowded venue.\n\nBy the time the concert ended, I still hadn\u2019t seen her. I texted her, \u201cMeet me at the car, I\u2019m leaving soon.\u201d She took forever to reply and finally said, \u201cOmg I\u2019m still with my friends, can we get a ride with you?\u201d\n\nAt this point, I was pissed. She ignored me the whole night, treated me like her personal chauffeur, and expected me to wait for her and her random friends?\n\nSo I said no. I told her she could find her own way home. She freaked out and started blowing up my phone, saying I was being \u201cpetty\u201d and \u201cimmature\u201d over something \u201cso small.\u201d She ended up having to get an Uber, which cost her almost $60.\n\nNow she and some mutual friends are saying I was too harsh and that I should have \u201cjust been the bigger person\u201d since I had driven anyway. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to be used as a ride when she couldn\u2019t even spend time with me for one night.\n\nAITAH?",

It's frustrating when someone takes advantage of your kindness without giving anything back, isn't it? The OP invested time and resources into supporting Jess's concert plans only for her to ditch them at the last minute... that's a clear sign something needs to change\n\nYou deserve a friend who values your companionship as much as you value theirs. Setting boundaries is important because friendships are about give-and-take, not just one person giving all the time. By making it clear that such behavior isn't acceptable, the OP sent an important message: respect and reciprocity matter in any relationship\n\nSo yes, NTA for standing up for yourself",

Especially since OP was the one who got the tickets.\n\n> This \u201chang out with me or I won\u2019t give you a ride back\u201d attitude makes you an AH.\n\nThey had a plan, OPs 'friend' broke that plan, so she doesn't get to whine when she looses out on the rest of it.",
