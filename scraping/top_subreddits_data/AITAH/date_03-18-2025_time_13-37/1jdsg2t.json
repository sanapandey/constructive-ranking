    "selftext": "My (35F) husband passed away suddenly last year, leaving me and our two kids (6M, 4F) completely heartbroken. He had a life insurance policy that paid out a significant sum, and while it doesnt make up for our loss, it has given us financial security.\n\nA few months ago, my in laws approached me with a request: they want me to give a portion of the money to my late husbands grandparents (his moms parents). Their reasoning is that they are struggling financially, and my husband would have wanted to help them.\n\nI do feel bad for them, but the thing is that they never really had a strong relationship with us. They didnt even come to our wedding, claiming it was too far, even though they travel for vacations all the time. They never made much effort to be in our childrens lives either. And now, they suddenly think theyre entitled to the money my husband left for his family which, in my mind, means our kids and me.\n\nMy MIL has been calling me selfish, saying theyre elderly and struggling, and that I should honor my husbands memory by helping them. But I feel like this money was meant for our childrens future. Its not like Im hoarding it, Ive set up college funds and am ensuring were stable. AITA?",

It will cause just as much, if not more, resentment to have to ignore them asking, constantly answer the same question, or yell at the people who are hounding you for something that is not theirs to take. Do you not think the in-laws are going to resent this uppity \"wife\" not giving them what they want immediately? Because pushy people rarely see the other person as being in the right. \"This is what I want and you not giving it to me just proves out selfish and greedy you are!\" (Regardless of how ironic or hypocritical that statement is.)\n\nI would tell them, \"Look, I've said no more than once and I know you're grieving and your parents are in a bad way but I'm in no position to help. If you can't respect that and won't let it go, then we are going to have to limit our contact until you understand how disrespectful and rude you're being.\" and then follow through with that threat.\n\nYou seem to think it's fine to hound a grieving widow about money but it's unreasonable to limit the contact with the person who is hounding a grieving widow about money. I'm sorry but I can't agree with you and at no point did the other person say anything \"psycho\" by suggesting low/no-contact. That is the correct response, after you attempt to verbally resolve the issue, when your boundaries aren't being respected.",

This gives you control over when a beneficiary of the trust would receive the money. There can be tax implications because life insurance benefiting an individual is not (federally) taxable in the US but different laws apply to insurance benefiting a trust. \n\nWhat we did was let the life insurance go to our family trust with provisions on what ages our kids need to be before they receive cash payouts. The trust includes provisions that the trustee is able to use the trust for college costs or even a down payment on a home - if he thinks it is well used. Because we trust our trustee more than family we gave him a lot of latitude. For example, my family has a long history of alcohol abuse, so he can decide not to payout at the specific ages, if he knows either child is abusing drugs or alcohol. \n\nJust some options. For this to work best, definitely talk to an estate attorney. It is worth the money to ensure everything is done correctly.",

That money is essentially there to replace the income you and your children would have had if your husband had not passed. It\u2019s to ensure you and your children can remain in level of financial comfort you are used to for years to come. \n\nIt\u2019s not the windfall your in laws seem to be treating it as. Even if you can afford to cover all the bills with your salary, you\u2019re still a single income household now. And children are expensive and living costs are always rising. \n\nYour children are so young and will need supporting for quite a few years yet. The life insurance was your husband\u2019s way of making sure he could support you and your children if he wasn\u2019t here. \n\nGrief is awful. It stays with you, sometimes it\u2019s easier to cope with but there are days it hits you like a freight train again years down the road. The children and yourself will likely need counselling too, which is expensive and ongoing. \n\nYour in-laws are basically trying to take much needed support, (that is designed to cover years of expenses when you lose someone) from two small children coping with the loss of their dad and a grieving widow. They should be ashamed of themselves. \n\nAsk them why they want to take away financial support from their grieving grandchildren/great-grandchildren. If your husband wanted to provide for his grandparents financially in the event of his passing, he would have. \n\nAlso, you likely know him far better than anyone else ever did. So you\u2019d know more than them if he would want to help them. Would you have even been in a position to help them financially if he were still here? Would they have even asked then? I doubt it, they have just seen a lump sum and decided they are entitled to it. If the insurance was set up to pay out his monthly salary each month, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be asking.",

Let's give her the benefit of the doubt that grief over suddenly losing a child is making her bat shit crazy (a very reasonable response). \n\nThe fact that it's her parents makes me even more suspicious that either a) she'll suggest you give the money to her to give to them, or b) has cooked up this scheme with her own mother, from whom she learned to be a conniving bitch. Either way, make no mistake about it, that money is going to end up with *her*. \n\nI had a destination second wedding 500 miles from all of my family and my 80 yo grandmother made the trip to be there and she *doesn't* travel all the time and didn't even like me all that much. The idea that grandparents would miss *any* significant events in their grandson's life tells me that they are absolutely miserable people who deserve nothing. \n\nYour kids are very young, and what you might consider significant could very well run out in a few years. Yeah, a lump sum looks like a lot, but consider your husband's earning potential over what should have been his lifetime. Is the payout equal to the amount of money he'd have earned, plus interest,plus 401k and other investments? Could you retire right now and never worry about money ever again? If the answer is no, better to hoard every dime like a miser to protect your family's future. \n\nIf you're still feeling even the tiniest pang of guilt, I'd call her bluff and tell her that if they are in such financial trouble, you'd be willing to sit down with them and a financial advisor and figure out what they need to do to get back on their feet. *You* hire the advisor and they come to you. I guarantee she'll shut right TF up. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and your family's tragedy. Your focus should be on healing for you and your children as best as you can, and this stranger on the interwebs is sending all of you some healing energy and prayers to hopefully offset your miserable mil and her greed.",

If I somehow die and leave behind money for her, it's her decision how it's used. If I wanted it used a specific way, I would have made provisions for that.",

Other reasons can be wanting to be sure there is money to pay the medical and funeral bills if the worst case happens, so that the parents are not thrown into a financial struggle at the worst moment of their lives, or to allow the parents a time-out from work to grieve.

One of my friends was widowed very unexpectedly -- on 9/11 -- and she had a terrible time. I hope you and your children are okay and have a lot of supportive people around you.)  \n  \nIf your husband had been concerned about his grandparents' finances, I'm sure he would have given them money while he was alive. After all, he planned ahead far enough to have arranged life insurance for himself so that his immediate family wouldn't be in need. The fact that he didn't do that suggests to me that he didn't think that he should jeopardize your future, no matter how fond he was of his grandparents.\n\nThere may be reasonable explanations for why they haven't been very involved with you and your children -- but you already noted that they seem to be able to go on trips, so I'm guessing that it's not health or (at least back then) poverty. And especially now, you don't need to spend a lot of money just to chat online, send cards or letters or little handmade gifts. \n\nYour MIL might say that it would honor your husband's memory, or that it was what he'd do if he were alive ... but circumstances have changed. It doesn't get much more drastic than a fairly-young dad no longer being around for his family. Unless he was on disability, I am assuming that he was working and earning a salary ... and even if he was at minimum wage, over 3 decades or more, that would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars, probably much more, that could have bought you and your kids a home, education, medical fees, etc.\n\nYour MIL is likely my age or older, and may not have kept track of inflation. When I was a child, a million dollars seemed like a huge amount of money. But now, that won't even pay for a modest home in many areas. If your husband's relatives got wind of the actual size of his insurance policy (I hope not, but people do gossip), it might have sounded like a fortune, and that here would be lots of money to share. But that wouldn't be accurate, especially now with the economy possibly taking a turn for the worse.  \n  \nYou've got two young children to provide for, and you and your husband did your best to try to plan a safe and secure future for them. Your kids won't be able to go out on their own for the better part of a decade and a half, minimum. That money is supposed to be for them. Well-invested, it could keep your kids from having to go out and work to support the family at a young age, maybe even drop out of school (as some of my friends had to do as teens).",

Since your in-laws are so sure that he would have, without a doubt, wanted a large portion of this money to go to his grandparents, despite them not having ANY role in your family\u2019s life, you need to ask them this:\n\n\u201cPerhaps prior to the sudden end of his life, perhaps he may have wanted to help them in some way, I can\u2019t really speak for him. However, our family\u2019s situation has obviously changed dramatically. With that said, do you think that given the *current* circumstances, he would want to ensure that his wife and children were able to continue living in their home, have food on the table, and his children could attend college debt free? *OR*, do you think that he would have wanted his children\u2019s college funds to be much smaller, so that we could help out his virtually estranged grandparents, financially?\u201d\n\nIf they say anything other than, \u201cyeah I guess you\u2019re right\u201d. You should clap back with: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to tell you right now that nothing would have stood in the way of ensuring his children were taken care of. Without his income over the next X amount of years (until they\u2019re adults) I will be the sole provider for our lives, which includes their college funds.  As our children\u2019s grandparents, I would have thought that you would have felt the same way. Honestly, I\u2019m quite surprised that you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlso, if he had wanted to help out his grandparents it would have been done with the expectation that he would be able to continue working and therefore would be able to continue providing for his family.  But he can\u2019t. \n\nThe money you have is finite. There\u2019s no replacing it down the road. Once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. All your children will have is whatever ONE parent\u2019s income can provide. *NOT TWO*. So yeah, even if he did want to help them out (you and I know he didn\u2019t), that decision would have been made by taking completely different variables into account.  Those variables are no longer the case. \n\nUnfortunately the truth is, whatever he may have wanted or not wanted to do, doesn\u2019t matter. He isn\u2019t here to decide. You are the one in charge of this money, and must prioritize your family and make decisions in the best interest of you and your children.  The fact they don\u2019t realize that, and even asked in the first place, is pretty insane and rude as hell. They should be prioritizing their grandchildren who just lost their father (your in-laws son) rather than putting MORE PRESSURE on you and rather than asking for your children to get less, so their financially irresponsible elderly parents, could get that money.",

Honestly, it\u2019s pretty selfish of your in laws to put others above their own grand children. \n\nAnd frankly when people find you have inherited or received money all sorts of excuses and demands surface. Stay focused on what matters most, you and your kids. Best wishes to you..!",

Additionally, you should consult with a financial advisor who will also give you the reasons behind a \u201cno.\u201d For example, a financial advisor will explain that for each $1Million, that only represents 20 years of a $50K income. If you incorporate inflation, that means the money has decreasing spending power. This is money that is intended to house, clothe, feed and provide education for your children. College alone would take half a million off the table if they were to attend a high end school. Imagine what gifting those funds would do if it meant that your children could not go to college. They\u2019ve already lost a father, don\u2019t take their future away from them.",

Bottom line is that if your husband had wanted his grandparents to have any kind of a payout, they would also have been listed as beneficiaries.\n\nThat money was left to you by your husband because he planned ahead for you and the kids. He wanted to be sure you all were taken care of.\n\nHe was well aware that his parents and his grandparents were adults. And that as adults, they were perfectly capable of planning for their own futures\u2026 Unlike the children at this point.\n\nNext time your MIL does this, you tell her that the matter is closed. That she and FIL are actually the woods who should be taking care of their own parents and not trying to force it onto what is essentially their grandchildren. So the grandparents\u2019 great grandchildren.\n\nThat those same grandparents could not even be bothered to attend your wedding. Could not be bothered to get to know your children, from whom MIL wants to steal money (and yes, you word it that way). And yet they always had plenty of time and money to go on vacation\u2026 None of which ever included visiting your late husband or his children.\n\nSo she needs to stop bringing this up, or you will reduce contact between you and the children and them. If her or her husband\u2018s parents need help, they are the ones that should be doing it, and if your husband wanted them to have money, he would\u2019ve listed them.\n\nNot only that, OP, you need to sit down now and make a journal of all the times this is been brought up and how\u2026 And when\u2026 To the best of your ability.\n\nBecause entitled grandparents like this are exactly the type that we try to get grandparents right if you lower contact. And since it does sound like they have a relationship with your children, you want to be able to be sure to have evidence as to why you lowered contact for the sake of the children.\n\nBecause I guarantee you, well, it may not have happened with the four year-old, if you came back on here and told us that your MIL has been making little comments about how you are not helping family, etc.\u2026 None of us would be surprised",

These are your husband's grandparents and they've made no effort to be a part of your life. You do sound a little bitter because they deemed your wedding unimportant enough for them to travel two, but at the same time did a lot of traveling for vacations and had a good life.\n\nYou say that your in-laws are coming to you and demanding you help out his grandparents. Let me ask you a question. Just how many in-laws are we talking about? How many brothers and sisters did his grandparents have that are still alive? How many children did they have that are still able to help? How many aunts and uncles and children and grandchildren and cousins are around to help his grandparents?\n\nAnd you say they're asking you to donate money to help out the old folks who are having financial trouble. What has led to these troubles? Is it just a shift in the economy or is it poor life skills management? And exactly how much money are they asking you to Pony up? And what's to say that this is the only time and they won't keep coming back to the trough?\n\nHere's a compromise. Ask exactly how much these people need for a one-time donation to help them out. Then count the number of households that exist in your in-laws family. Divide what they are asking for by the number of households. Say that they're asking for $10,000 and there are 10 households that could contribute. Tell them that you will contribute $1,000 just as soon as the rest of them agree to contribute an equal amount. Sit back and watch the excuses start to fly and then remind them that they're obviously too selfish to want to help.",

Honor your husband's memory by using his life insurance for the purpose it was intended - taking care of you and his children. If he had wanted to take care of others, he could have purchased additional policies with other beneficiaries or even named multiple beneficiaries on the policy he had. He chose not to do that. He chose you and his children. Keep that thought firmly lodged in your brain at all times.\n\nYou have the cards now. Tell your **former** MIL that if she wishes to have any contact with you or her grandchildren, moving forward, she needs to drop this issue and never mention it again. You need to set serious boundaries right now, or she will think it is okay to continue meddling in your life going forward. \n\nWhen my husband died, my own sister told me that our family would never accept it if I ever remarried. And I never did. I'm 65+, now, and will die alone. Don't be me. Live your life when you are ready. Find happiness for you and your children. \n\nBest wishes to you.",

You were left with dependents who have a long way to go before adulthood. You're going to need that money, and in fact, you might consider finding part-time work once both kids are in school.

Stay focused on caring for your little brood and making the most of the assets you've been left with; find a good investment management company to hopefully grow your money. You'll need it.",

Here\u2019s a perfect example from maybe When my company (large national e-commerce and brick and mortar retailer) went belly up, and I had two small children and a house payment and a baby on the way, my mother asked for a \u201cloan\u201d of $10,000. My parents were known for the tens of thousands they\u2019d borrowed each from their parents and never paid back over the years. And now that they\u2019d exhausted those resources (or they were deceased), they were coming to me, their firstborn, for that kind of money right after I lost my job?\n\nWhen I explained that I in no way shape or form had that kind of cash lying around and especially not at that kind of time, she further tried to wheedle \u201cjust a couple thousand\u201d out of me and promised to get it \u201cright back\u201d to me the following week.\n\nThis, my own mother.\n\nSo definitely do not feel bad for turning away your in laws. If your husband had felt it necessary to include his parents he\u2019d have made them beneficiaries but he did not. That\u2019s not how this works. Parents do not inherit from their children. \n\nSending you all the best in your time of adjustment.",

In most states, they can't legally walk away and neglect them physically or financially. They can however fill out the application forms to get local state support services like in home support or nursing home care or transportation services. I recommend they reach out to the non profit \"Light for Seniors\" they can provide information, guidance with forms, and referrals for a fee.

If they were struggling and had a meaningful relationship with your husband, perhaps he would have chosen to help them while he was alive\u2014but that was his decision to make, not one that should be forced upon you after his passing.\n\nYour MIL calling you selfish is unfair and manipulative. It's easy for people to be generous with money that isn't theirs. If she feels so strongly about helping them, she can contribute to their needs.\n\nYou are already making responsible choices by securing your children's future and ensuring financial stability for your family. If you personally felt compelled to help his grandparents, that would be your choice, but you are under no obligation to do so.\n\nThis money was meant for you and your children. You are doing exactly what your husband would have wanted: taking care of the family you built together.",

That to me screams, \u201cWe made stupid financial decisions(as an older couple with decades of knowledge and wisdom regarding money no less) and don\u2019t want to actually work or figure out another avenue to fix our fuck up because we\u2019re lazy. So we\u2019re just going to guilt trip our daughter in law in to giving us life insurance money from OUR dead son.\u201d I genuinely want these peoples number so I can ask them, \u201cwhat in the actual fuck?\u201d\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll retroactively fix it, but for now it\u2019s sticking. I did not realize it is the GRANDPARENTS of the son/husband. That just makes it worse. You even mentioned they didn\u2019t go to y\u2019all\u2019s wedding, but had no trouble going on vacations. That just makes it even more of a, \u201cfuck off, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have retired so early/dealt with your finances better.\u201d I\u2019m sure they think they\u2019re *owed* this money because they\u2019re from *that* generation. Entitled to it, if you will. Wow, nothing says genuinely shitty people like, \u201cI didn\u2019t care enough about you or our grandson, so we didn\u2019t attend your wedding. We also went on vacations around the same time period so we definitely could have came, we just didn\u2019t want to. With that said, we dealt with our finances poorly and fully expected our children to pick up the slack come time when we ran out. Well, looks like our children couldn\u2019t help so we heard our grandson died and had a life insurance pay out. I\u2019m pretty sure he mentioned at some point that in the event of his untimely death he wanted us to have some of the money even though you\u2019re young with two children. You\u2019re still able to work and take care of yourself as well as the kids. You really only need a little bit of that money.\u201d Like\u2026.I can head those two old fucks genuinely convincing themselves of this bullshit. People suck.",

See how they can help you structure that money to make it last for what you need it for. Also, now that you are the Sole Provider, work with that financial planner to set up a plan for your kids if you were to pass away unexpectedly. Obviously this is much more important now that it is just you.\n\n\nSo sorry you are going through this please try to put off larger life decisions if possible while you are grieving. In addition to talking to a fiduciary financial planner get involved with some grief support groups that may be very helpful. By putting off major life decisions I mean starting a new romantic relationship or moving.",

I pay that premium every month in hopes that if I die, my wife and child will continue to have enough money to live their lives well.  I feel very strongly here, that money is YOURS for you to raise those children with.  His parents mismanaging their finances and needing handouts for retirement really don't factor into it.\n\nIf (and only if) you and the kids are set...like you have current expenses mapped out, future expenses, college, camps, braces, band instruments...and you're in a financial position to be charitable, feel free to be charitable.  But, I would not get fast and loose.  Your primary concern is those kids and as a father I feel getting those kids off into the world successfully and removing the financial burdens from my wife is the only reason I make that premium payment every month.\n\nMy personal experience is obviously shining through here.   If your situation is vastly different, I apologize if this is off the mark..but I'd be surprised if your husband intended much more than being a financial provider to you and the kids when he took that policy out.\n\nYour inlaws can suck an egg.  Selfish opportunistic assholes is what they are.  They see a dollar sign and think this is opportunity.",

Tell them to take care of their own damn parents. ***some on here might mention that in some states visitation rights can be sought by the grandparents if it\u2019s in the kids best interests. But that\u2019s on your in laws to enforce/make happen which means hiring an attorney, multiple court dates, etc. and it\u2019s rare and I don\u2019t see a court being sympathetic toward the in laws especially after hearing you testify why you don\u2019t want the grandparents visiting.",

We as a couple,then married paid for it every month but then after the accident happened who do you think benifited from it!!?crazy this was to protect his \"truck\"that was in her name and 2 pmts left,she took the truck,$50k,then I was going to fight it so she finally put 15k in my daughters and his others daughters(from his first marriage)and put into savings bonds (kept the rest) however his other child was 7 yrs old,I had her the majority of her life and provided for her physically and financially!(long story) they kept hold of her bonds which was fine,however bonds are 18 yrs maturity. so when she was 26 they gave called her to the house as (the family never had anything to do with either of his children ,not even a card on a holiday or birthdays) but they gave her a \"CHECK\" for $15k!!! So sad and so very Greedy! I honestly dont know why or where the heartless cold people come from! or where \"in laws\" feel \"entitled\" from! So you are not alone! You have kids to raise! DO NOT let your in-laws make you feel guilty! if your husband wanted to leave anything or provide to anyone else besides you and your kids he would have! trust me you will need all he left! my daughter is now 31 and a \"lawyer\" were in NYS no extra grants,$$$ given for school! ill be paying on loans till the day i die!

However significant that sum may seem, it's likely that you're going to have to shepherd it and manage it carefully to make sure it lasts long enough to provide you and your children with what you need.\n\nIf your husband wanted to provide for his parents in the event of his death, he should have bought additional life insurance with them as the beneficiary. They're entitled to none of it.\n\nI'm sorry that they're struggling, and if you're really in a financial position to help them out, then that's your choice, but it's certainly not your obligation.

If I were to pass away, I would want every cent of my life insurance payouts to go to making sure my kids are taken care of, not to selfish grandparents who appearantly spent their retirement money frivolously.  So I can very confidently tell you that your late husband would have wanted you to do exactly what you stated you are doing: keep the money to give your kids the best present and future possible.  \n\nI will give another example from a generation earlier to further reinforce your decision.  That is, the type of situation where it would actually make sense to support grandparents with some of the money.  My dad was not around growing up, and we lived with my grandparents.  My mom's dad was very much a \"replacement dad\" for my real dad who wasn't there.  He provided a lot of stability and the role model I wouldn't have otherwise had.  Just as much, my mom's mom was a huge part of my life, taught me many things, and helped take care of me when my mom was working.  In that kind of situation, I would think there would be an excellent argument for helping support the grandparents if they needed it; as they would be helping provide very important stability and support to the kids.  So in essence, the money is still going to help the kids, just indirectly by supporting grandparents who are supporting them.\n\nBut giving money to grandparents who are not around and never even made any effort to be in the kid's lives is a hard pass.",

Meanwhile, you are a one income household trying to support yourself and two young children.\n\nThey weren't even around so it's not like they're asking you to, say, return a favour after they planned their lives around you and the kids to provide excessive and often inconvenient free grandparent childcare. They're basically arguing they should get it for outliving their son and not saving enough for retirement.\n\nThat money can't fill most of the gap your husband left in all your future plans, but it can help fill some of that unspoken and under recognized economic hole of the money he would've contributed to your family and raising your kids if he had been there.\n\nThe order should be:\n1.) Immediate living expenses & stability (keep your kids and *you*, their only remaining parents they depend fully on, alive, fed, housed, healthy, educated, safe, serving grief, etc)\n2.) Kids future (college and anything else common for your family to save for, etc... plus anything important you want for them)\n3.) Filling in gaps in your own retirement (Your husband's income coming into the family would've allowed you to save more of your own money for retirement. He would've also been helping you if you came up short assuming you remained married for life.)\n\nIf there's money left after that, that's when the discussion with the parents can be taken seriously. Unless they paid the final expenses for him and expected you'd help out after life insurance came through. Otherwise, they are trying to take what is rightfully yours meant to ease some of the financial burden of having kids without a lifetime with your spouse's earnings.... something his parents have had the benefit of having.\n\n*Edit: Sorry, I may have misread.... this is the grandparents of your late husband? Don't they have other progeny to beg who didn't just suffer a major loss? They should have more young able bodied working relatives being older than you, not less. They're taking advantage.
