    "selftext": "I (24F) recently had a big birthday party for my 25th. I don\u2019t usually go all out, but this year felt special, so I rented a nice event space, had catering, and invited about 50 friends and family. It was supposed to be a night all about celebrating, dancing, and having fun.\n\nA week before the party, my best friend Lily (24F) asked me for a favor. She wanted to propose to her boyfriend at my party. I was a little thrown off because I assumed she\u2019d want something more personal, but she said she wanted to do it in front of all their mutual friends and thought it would be \u201cperfect timing.\u201d\n\nI was hesitant but politely told her that I\u2019d rather she didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t because I don\u2019t support them\u2014I do! I just didn\u2019t want my birthday to turn into an engagement party. I wanted one night to celebrate me, not someone else\u2019s relationship milestone.\n\nShe seemed disappointed but said she understood. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nWell, apparently it wasn\u2019t.\n\nHalfway through the party, Lily tapped her glass and started giving a little speech. I had a bad feeling instantly, and sure enough, she turned to her boyfriend, pulled out a ring, and proposed right there.\n\nEveryone cheered, and suddenly, the whole party shifted focus. People were congratulating them, taking pictures, and I was just\u2026 standing there, watching my birthday get hijacked. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene, so I smiled and congratulated them, but I was furious inside.\n\nAfter the party, I confronted Lily and asked why she went behind my back when I specifically told her no. She got defensive and said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t pass up the moment\u201d and that I was being selfish for not just being happy for her. She even implied that I was overreacting because \u201cit\u2019s not like your birthday was ruined.\u201d\n\nBut it kind of was? I spent so much time and money planning this night, only for it to turn into her moment instead of mine. Some friends are on my side, but others think I should just let it go and that \u201clove should be celebrated whenever it happens.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026 AITAH for not letting her propose at my party?",

            "body": "I\u2019m not joking here. If you made it about halfway through the ninth, sent her a bill for half of what you paid for everything.\n\nAnd the way you do that as you sent it by text. Something along the lines of\u2026\n\n\u201cLilly. You asked me if you could propose to your boyfriend at my birthday party. The one that I organized and paid for.\n\nI very specifically told you that I was not comfortable with this. I had spent quite a lot of time and money and effort to set up a party for my 25th birthday. I explained to you that I didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to hijack someone else\u2019s event.\n\nUnfortunately, you decided to proceed to ruin my birthday party since the rest of my party became all about your engagement party\u2026 Which you didn\u2019t pay for. Which you didn\u2019t organize. Which wasn\u2019t your event in the first place.\n\nSo since the last half of my birthday party became your de facto engagement party, I am requesting that you reimburse me for half of the money I spent.\n\nYou did not pay for the venue. You did not pay for the food. You did not pay for the decorations. And you certainly did not spend any time and effort to organize your own event. Therefore I\u2019m requesting $xxxx From you within the next 30 days.\u201d\n\n\nNow understand that Lily\u2019s gonna be pissed. You may even have some other friends that are pissed. Because she\u2019s gonna pass out some story. But\u2026 The reason you texted this is anyone this entitled is absolutely going to reply to you.\n\nNo, whatever you do, if she tries calling, you don\u2019t pick up. If she comes to your house to talk, you hit record on your phone.\n\nBecause she is going to admit, I guarantee you, that she knew you asked her not to do this. And she knew why. But that she just couldn\u2019t help herself because all of the friends weren\u2019t together.\n\nAnd there you have her admission that she knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to do this. That she knew it was not her event. That she knew you\u2019d spend a lot of time and money and effort on this event\u2026 And she hijacked it.\n\nAnd then, if she doesn\u2019t pay you, you file in small claims court. It doesn\u2019t cost much to file. And the fact is that even if you lose, it didn\u2019t cost you anything but a very small filing fee and a little bit of time. You might have to pay a service fee to have local law-enforcement serve her with the lawsuit.\n\nBecause your friendship with Lily is done. Let\u2019s be honest. And some of your friends won\u2019t like that you did this, but then you can just tell them not to worry\u2026 That you\u2019re sure at their next event, she\u2019ll probably announce that she\u2019s pregnant. Won\u2019t that be fun after they\u2019ve spent a good amount of money for her to just hijack their event.",

Let me guess between the two of you, you're the friend that gives more into the overall friendship and you care more about her and her feelings, well-being, happiness and success than she does you and yours?\n\nSounds like she's a taking kind of person and not the giving type. I know this type. I have an ex best friend who was very selfish and self-centered.  In our 12 year friendship, it was always a lopsided friendship I would go out of my way to not just be a good friend but an amazing friend. I put 110% into the friendship while she put in maybe 10% \n\nIf you haven't cut ties with her you should but before you do definitely do as the other's are saying be petty and hijack her wedding definitely wear a white wedding looking dress &  bill her for her engagement party and if she doesn't pay take her to small claims court and sue.  Please tell us there's an update if you get sweet revenge! \n\nHope you have a wonderful 26th birthday \ud83c\udf82 next year, and your birthday gift is a new amazing best friend!",
