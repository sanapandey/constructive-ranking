    "selftext": "I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) for almost a year. He\u2019s funny, charming, and generally a great guy, but lately, he\u2019s developed a habit of making jokes about me in front of his friends.\n\nAt first, it was small things like teasing me about how long I take to get ready or how I can\u2019t cook. I laughed it off because I don\u2019t take myself too seriously. But then it escalated. He started making comments about my job (I work in marketing, and he calls it \"playing on Instagram all day\") and my intelligence, joking that I \"get by on my looks.\"\n\nHis friends always laugh, and I just awkwardly smile, but it\u2019s been bothering me. I\u2019ve told him in private that it makes me uncomfortable, but he brushes it off as me being \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d\n\nLast weekend, we were at a bar with his friends, and he made a joke about how I \"tried to change a tire once and almost called 911.\" It was embarrassing because it wasn\u2019t even true, I was just watching YouTube to make sure I did it right. His friends laughed, and I snapped.\n\nI said, \u201cOh, I could make jokes about you too, but I respect you too much to embarrass you in front of your friends.\u201d\n\nThe mood shifted immediately. His friends went silent, and my boyfriend got super defensive, saying I \u201cruined the vibe.\u201d On the way home, he was furious, calling me immature and saying I embarrassed him. He even said, \u201cGuys joke with their girls all the time. You\u2019re the only one who can\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nIn the heat of the moment i snaped and, told him I was done being the butt of his jokes, and now he's barely speaking to me...\n\nAITA for real?!?\n\n",

Or vice versa (whatever the genders work out to be).\u00a0\n\n\nIt is a known fact that when one parent is routinely disrespectful to the other parent that the children become disrespectful and don't respect that parent.\u00a0\n\n\nMy husband is quick to shut down disrespect against me. \"Don't you talk to your mom like that, she works hard\". I do the same for him. My friends who are single parents struggling to co-parent have serious issues where their kids are super disrespectful and it's ALWAYS worse after a visit with dad and they witness the disrespect. I personally see a big difference.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, this isn't always the case where some kids see right through it. My nephew is 12 and hates his dad because Dad is a POS. He was telling me at Christmas \"he's so F-ing lazy and disrespectful....you should see how he treats (stepmoms name), always yelling and name calling. \". I tell him, you know you shouldn't swear. He says he's sorry but he's so upset. I tell him you know you don't act that way and it's amazing that you understand we don't yell at, or demean\u00a0 the people we love. You know what happens when we treat mistreat our loved ones? Eventually they get tired of the abuse and leave you.\u00a0\n\n\nWe had to do intensive therapy after his mom left the DV situation and this kid saw a lot. We've done great messaging around identifying abusive behavior and what's not ok to help him overcome his copying dad. He USED to say \"shut up bitch\" to his mom. So there can be help out there to change the kids behavior.\u00a0\n\n\nNow he can spot the abuse when it's dad's custody time and put labels to what's happening. His dad calls this child alienation but we don't use his dad as an example unless the child brings up specific behavior about dad and we'll say it's the wrong type of behavior. No, he shouldn't punch a hole in the wall or call your stepmom retarded. You're right, that's abusive behavior.\u00a0 Recently he told his dad to stop using weaponized incompetence to make his stepmom do everything. Ha ha ha. Kid has a mouth. Smart kid said it on his way out the door at the end of visitation so he wouldn't be punished.\u00a0",

I used to tease him in front of my friends because I was used to the rough way my friends & I would joke with each other and learning how to behave in a more serious relationship. He told me it felt degrading and like bullying. I cried because I didn\u2019t realize how I was hurting him and I just kept apologizing. Then I went and apologized to all the people I joked about him in front of, because I was embarrassed to realize I\u2019d been treating my partner in such a disrespectful way in front of others. \n\nSo yeah, an example of how I dealt with similar issues when I was 7 years younger than your BF currently is.\n\nETA: I feel like I definitely don\u2019t deserve all this praise, was an insecure 19yo learning how to be vulnerable in a caring relationship (a big part of why I would make those jokes). But thank you, I still look back on that behavior and cringe, so it helps soothe my self-loathing to get these comments \ud83d\udc95",

When one partner feels belittled or embarrassed by the other's jokes, it's a red flag, something to really pay attention to. Boundaries matter! If someone keeps making you uncomfortable despite telling them how you feel, that behavior just isn't okay. In your situation, where your boyfriend has crossed into disrespecting you in front of others, this goes beyond being sensitive, it's about feeling valued and respected\n\nIt seems clear that what's happening here is more than just teasing, it's crossing a line. Relationships should be safe spaces, places where both partners support each other instead of causing discomfort or embarrassment. Considering everything, I'd say YTA because your feelings were not respected. It's crucial to feel uplifted in a relationship rather than embarrassed",

I think you've probably already seen how he would react and that may not be the best for your relationship. Or it could be the thing that makes him realize he's been a dick. Or it could make him double down on his \"poking fun\". And then there's the nuke button, telling him if he does that shit again, you guys are done. You're already pissed at him, and really, for very good reason, he's disregarding your feelings and concern. Technically you have a very valid reason for just ending it now and moving on.
