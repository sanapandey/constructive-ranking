    "selftext": "I (34M) met my wife (32F) 5 years ago. She was $60K in debt from credit cards, personal loans, etc. A while ago after we got serious, I helped her get a consolidation loan from consumer credit card relief. I actually paid it all off on her behalf through them. Monthly payments, the whole deal.\n\nThings were great for about 2 years. We got married, bought a house, life was good.\n\nThen I started noticing packages arriving daily. She got secretive about the mail. Bills were being hidden. When I finally confronted her, turns out she'd racked up another $45K in debt across 7 different cards.\n\nI was devastated. We tried counseling (financial and marriage), but she kept spending behind my back. She even opened a card in MY name.\n\nI filed for divorce last month. Now her family is blowing up my phone saying I'm an asshole for abandoning her \"when she needs help most.\"\n\nAITAH for walking away? I feel like I tried everything and she betrayed my trust repeatedly.",

Pre marital assets and debts are treated as separate.  \n  \nThe reason I know that is that first wife of a friend filed for divorce at 9 years 11 months. When she realised that, She withdrew the motion, pretended to want to reconcile, then refiled after the 10 years mark. She would have been entitled to half the proceed of the sale of their house that he had bought before he met her. However her lawyer messed up and when he refiled it was marked as a continuance of the original. Initially nobody noticed. But the ex pissed off the judge by turning late multiple time and in 2 occasion not showing up at all, so he had time to read the file. He pointed the mistake to my friend and his lawyer. Final Judgement was she was only entitled to half the values of their 7 years car and all her debts remained hers. \nTurn out that getting divorced was the best thing that happened to him. Sold his house in 2007 nearly at peak value. Put the money in an account and invested. Moved to Canada for work for 2.5 years, rented there. A property developer had bought his and his neighbour house to combine them. He extended my friend's house to become a McMansion, destroyed the neighbour house to dig an infinity pool and build a small guest house. Permit was delayed then subprime hit. Market crashed. When my friend moved back to California, he was able to buy back the combined properties from foreclosure with the proceeds of his sale 3.5 years earlier. Met his second wife at the New Year/House warming party he organised at his house.",

My mom sadly coddled him a lot now he's a useless adult, he was fine before my dad died but then he turned into a whole mess afterwards cuz the person keeping him in line was gone. Told my mom that if/when she dies, I am definitely not gonna be continuing to raise her useless son especially started to see him as a piece of human trash when he tried to hit my mom after he crashed her car. Keep in mind this man is 11 years older then me with many degrees and certificates he just can't keep a job cuz he spends all his weekends drinking, doesn't show Mondays and is always \"sick\" every other day, if not that he doesnt have transport money after spending a lump some on booze and girls. Only reason my mom is helping is because she feels guilty about \"failing to raise him right\" and when the time comes to take drastic measures he goes to bad mouth her and people including our family guilt trip her into taking his ass back.\n\nOP definitely isn't a victim he knew what he was getting into, just like someone dating a cheater knows what their getting into or someone dating a scam artist knows. Knowingly dating someone with issues or addictions will end badly, in marriage its just 10\u00d7 worse. Especially if you \"help them through it\" rather then let them work on it and fix their own life, they'll just see it as normal for you to be the hero and drag you down with them.",

Funny part is none of these people want him near their house let alone being friends with their sons, thats how shitty he is. But they \"feel bad\" when he's hurt and kicked out with no money (he still eats at our granny's and sleeps there all the few times my mom has kicked him mostly for stealing from her). So she's essentially trapped in the situation as in her age, she's old and a widow, her support system is all she has and when they turn on her she gets isolated and at this point there's a lot going on she has to deal with. So honestly, I feel more bad for her as he's essentially using her as his meal cow. When I look at how they interact, you'd swear she's his servant and he's the man of the house who gets food, water, TV and sometimes money, doesn't care where it came from, and all he has to do us guilt trip mom or gaslight her when he needs something, he sometimes does garden to get allowance but that's like...once a year and he only does it when mom reaches a point of wanting to hire someone. She's basically trapped in a toxic servitude relationship with him, and he's worked her so bad at this point she's trapped in a toxic cycle due to a lot of toxic people surrounding her. I honestly don't know how to help her, hence the only thing I did specify is that I will not be taking care of my brother when she can't. When I do try, the moment I travel to school, the demon starts racking up brownie and pitty points from our family to pressure her. The only solution would be moving and just leaving all of them but she loves her family so what can I do. My mom is by no means like this with other kids, not even me, my brother just broke her when it comes to him in a very cruel way, he holds the cards, at this point, she's trapped with him, either that or her family and friends will be barking at her. The way I felt sad when she bought him clothes and asked why when he treats her so bad she said \"because people will say I treat him bad and that I love you more, he shouldn't walk around with bad clothes\", I felt like crying, he had good clothes he just chose to wore the bad ones, and I'm guessing someone or some people started barking at her some more for it. My mom is basically surrounded by toxic people, but because their her family, it hurts her and pushes her back to coddling the man child.\n\n\nI do hope OP does get counselling and never has a situation like this happen again, and I hope those who haven't done this not repeat his mistake.",

Even IF you still really wanted to remain committed to your wife and see this through to the bitter end (or farther along than you are now) - *marriage is part of the problem here,* not a solution.

She took out a loan against her deferred comp to pay it off, and did so successfully. Then, we got engaged and she started back up with the ridiculous spending again. I caught on when we were talking to a contractor about an addition on my house in anticipation of our future. I hadn\u2019t planned on doing anything for a year, and told her, and the contractor, this was just to see how much it would cost and then figure out the finances from there. \n She immediately wanted to hire them and get started on slapping it all together. When I asked where all of the upfront money would come from, after explaining that it\u2019d have to be 50/50, she flattened me with her answer. Credit cards and use the money in my son\u2019s savings account I\u2019ve had for him since birth! The cc wasn\u2019t a surprise but, the thought that my son\u2019s account was somehow an option was. Her excuse was we could \u201cpay it back\u201d and it ok because she didn\u2019t have an account like that for her daughters. \n We were both divorced w/ kids but, she not only made as much $$ at her job as I do but, she got $$ from her ex husband every month. Whereas, my ex wife made slightly more than me but, we agreed to no support because it would only hurt our son w/ no advantage to either of us. \n After I let the contractor know that I was firm in the one year plan due to finances, she started to push even harder. Until, I found one of her recent cc bills out while at her house one day. It was $19k. Then, it dawned on me as to why she was pushing to get the timeline for everything sped up so much. I think we lasted another 5 months before we broke up. After the contractors thing, she decided it should be a new house, and those were even crazier in price. Since then, I\u2019ve met a few women that had the same mindset. It\u2019s not as uncommon as I once thought it was. Now, I understand why people want background and credit checks on people before they get serious. Lol",

That not going into debt or if it\u2019s some credit card debt for something like a vacation ir some great new furniture\u2026.. it\u2019s not secret deceitful surreptitious debt! \n\nShe has a disease and addiction. And I\u2019m not saying that bc of the amount. If she had that much debt from one car loan, okay. From devastating medical debt, we wouldn\u2019t be talking about this. From deciding to go back to school, different. Even from a few major luxury purchases out Ont he open she fully intend to pay off over a year. Sounds great. \n\nBut this is addict behavior. 45k in smaller compulsive SECRET purchases is crazy. And scream to a mind stunted at about 13 years old. It is sad. \n\nBut you did save her once. \n\nYou cannot save her again. \n\nMarriage is for asset accumulation and management. To leave for your children or progeny or even charity or other family members or just to build and save for your retirement.\n\nThat\u2019s a preposterous amount of debt. \n\nThat\u2019s like down payment on a rental property that could be funding your entire life type of debt. \n\nYou must divorce. \n\nI\u2019d divorce tf outta you if you did that to me.",

That isn't something you do to somebody you're supposed to love - it's an enormous betrayal, one that easily justifies ending the relationship. It was bad enough for her to do it even once. \n\nDoing it a second time after being given a second chance - and hiding it from you rather than asking for help to control her impulses - is even more of a betrayal. I don't know where you live, but I wherever it is, taking out a credit card in someone else's name must be a crime.\n\nNobody can fairly expect you to stay with someone who seems hellbent on wrecking both your lives with debt. You are wise to get out right away. \n\nAnd don't pay any of her debts this time, especially not anything on that card in your name, at least not until you're sure that it won't mean you're accepting the whole debt (other posts about identity theft here has mentioned that as a possibility, so be careful!).

Then block all of her friends and relatives who try to continue to contact and harass you.",

If someone with a known problem of getting into debt is spending on random bullshit you confront that shit immediately.\n\nALso if real, which i would guess it might well not be, because it's just too silly, then I'd leverage reporting her for credit card fraud or accepting the divorce quickly, with low lawyer fees by not fighting and taking the debt for herself.

We didn\u2019t live together or get married because we both had kids in our respective towns high schools and neither was taking the kids out. But a relationship that long is like a marriage. \n\nThe whole time she has debt issues. Initially I did her taxes and she had $15k in CC debt and $35k home equity loan for her masters degree. She was never able to finish her degree because her daughter got sick and she had to stop going to classes. Out of her control. \n\nBut she was completely nonchalant about the debt. She didn\u2019t have lavish spending: older car, small townhouse, few vacations, lots of resale shop clothes. Her only real out of line spending was her food, she didn\u2019t go out a lot but always got organic food for home. One month it was $1500. \n\nShe was a teacher making $100k and her mortgage plus taxes was only $900. I could never really figure out why nothing was getting paid off. \n\nI got her to start to beat down the CC debt and she paid off a couple of them. Then that stopped. I did spreadsheets for her. I went to counseling with her. I ignored it. I got mad about it. I tried everything. At one point I realized she just didn\u2019t see it as a problem and it probably would never go away. \n\nThen\u2026 her daughter is starting college: she takes out $24000 parent plus loan, with no discussion, and didn\u2019t even ask her ex for anything. Well, she has 2 kids times 4 years each kid which will be $200000 more debt. \n\nThen I start hearing comments like \u201cif we are going to family then family helps each other out\u201d with things like college. Uh, no, family talks about it and makes a reasonable plan, like dad pay a third, mom pays a third and the kid pays a third, not the unrelated boyfriend covers it. \n\nI realized I would never have a true partner in her financially, and had to bail. It was brutal, I thought I\u2019d spend my life with her. Took years to recover emotionally. Other than the money thing she was awesome, but destroying the family financially is no bueno, even if it\u2019s for your kids. \n\nBut it does get better. Now I\u2019m married to a CPA who\u2019s crazy about me and is 5\u20199\u201d, 145, DD and has $2M in the bank. Will have $3M before she retires. Turns out she had $35k in debt when we met and I had told her about my ex who I bailed on due to debt (not knowing my now wife had any debt).  She blasted that debt down like a firehose on a campfire because she knew I\u2019d drop her for that. Paid it off in less than six months. \n\nIn a few years we are moving to Europe for travel and extended stays. Life is good.",

Doing all of those things and lying and hiding things, it's basically akin to cheating. How are you supposed to trust her and move forward from that?  I don't blame you at all, I think you did the right thing. Her family can say whatever they want but they really should be focusing their anger and energy toward her and why she continues to do these things and allowed her marriage to break over it. They are focusing their anger and energy in the wrong place. Also, if you've already let her family know everything that she did and they're aware of all the circumstances, and yet they still are giving you a hard time, do not feel like you need to keep replying to them.",

U don't want to be responsible for the other persons debt in the end if u didn't buy or agree to buy all that stuff.\n\n1. Whatever you come into the marriage with u, leave with (unless one becomes a SAHM or SAHD, then redo the agreement accordingly)\n\n2. Whatever debt you incur in your name is solely your (not including joint items bought during marriage home, car, boat, investment properties). I've heard about prenuptial agreements that have these clauses.",

There is no reason to stick around trying to help her when she is not open to changing. \nCompulsory spending is usually a symptom of a deeper problem. Jealously, feeling inadequate, depression, FOMO, and so much more. Sometimes it is just the desire to \"keep up with the Jones's\" either way it is the same as any other addiction. They do self destructive things and they mifht even say they want help but then do literally nothing to change their ways. \n\nI had an employee who was addicted to hard drugs. He would say the rifjt things about wanting to clean up his life for his little girl but every weekend he would get absolutely trashed and wake up Monday in a random place having been on a bender since friday night. He would be an absolute disaster and would have to call out from work since he hadn't showered in days and looked strung out. After a while of this I had to fire him since he was calling out every Monday and he wasn't making any effort to change. I heard he finally checked himself into rehab after that. After he lost his job his GF couldn't tolerate his behavior any more and moved out with their kid. It was only after he woke up in an abandoned building afterwards that he checked himself into rehab. He took it seriously. I helped him get a new job, one for the government where they actually did regular drug testing. He had to be held accountable and face the consequences before he changed. I don't know if he reconciled with his GF or not but either way he is now going to be a better father now that he is clean. \n\nOP at this point I would treat her like an addict. She did the exact same things and it hurt you in the same way. She might not be a bad person but that doesn't mean you have to accept, tolerate, and support her addiction. To the families that say you need to stay to help, tell them you aren't going to stand on a sinking ship just bexause she refuses to get off. You are helping yourself and if she wants help she has been given all the help in the world but never changed. You have to get off the sinking ship so she can see the reality of her situation and face the consequences of her actions.",

We suggested he get a separate bank account without her name on it to make as an emergency fund but he thought that was dishonest or something. \n\nThe reason I ask this is if she is trying to spend less, trying to do better that's something, but if she doesn't want to no amount of therapy will make her stop and care about not being in debt. \n\nThey didn't divorce because he wanted to they divorced because she didn't want to be with him anymore.

Stop marrying people if you are not ready to stay committed to them even in the face of things like Op is facing. If marriage doesn't mean that much to you, DON'T DO IT AT ALL!! Stop expecting your spouse to never change, or never have issues, or never betray you. All of these things are possible and you should only make that commitment, if you really can handle that commitment.\u00a0\n\n\nYes there are times when divorce is the only option, but it should only ever be considered if everything else has been tried and exhausted.",
