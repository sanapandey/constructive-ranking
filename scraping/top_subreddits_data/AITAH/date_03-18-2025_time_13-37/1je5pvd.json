    "selftext": "So, I (24F) have a pretty small apartment\u2014like, two bedrooms, one bathroom, and not a lot of space. I love my place, but it\u2019s definitely cozy.\n\nRecently, my friend Lara (25F) called me and said she was coming to town for a couple of days and asked if she could stay at my place. We\u2019re close, so I said yes, no problem\u2014but here\u2019s the kicker: she showed up with her dog and didn\u2019t mention it beforehand.\n\nNow, I love animals, but my apartment is not pet-friendly, and I\u2019m allergic to dogs. I\u2019ve mentioned my allergies to her before, and she knows I\u2019m not the biggest fan of having pets in small spaces.\n\nWhen she arrived, I was polite and offered to help her find a nearby pet-friendly hotel, but she started insisting that I should just let her keep her dog at my place for the night. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s just for a couple of days, can\u2019t you just suck it up?\u201d\n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with her dog being there, especially since I would be miserable with my allergies and it\u2019s really just too small for a dog to be running around. She got really upset, saying that I was being unreasonable and overreacting and that I was \u201cruining her trip.\u201d\n\nI ended up telling her she could either leave the dog in a kennel or find another place to stay. She left and didn\u2019t speak to me for a couple of days. A few of my mutual friends think I should have been more accommodating, but I think I have a right to prioritize my health and comfort.\n\nAITAH for not letting her stay with her dog?",
