    "selftext": "So I (32,M)  living in London and currently married to my husband (33,M) for 5 years now. He had been married to a woman Erica before me and they have a daughter together, Sophie (8 f). Sophie lives with us because  of the custody arrangement. Something of importance here is that I am of indian descent,  And in 2022 my husband and I , we welcomed twin boys through IVF, so I teach my children Hindi and talk to them in Hindi, because it's important to me. I am raising them to be bilingual. But since Sophie lives with us, she also picked up on my Hindi words. Last week Erica had come for dinner during which Sophie said some random words in Hindi. I didn't even know she had picked up on it. Anyway, after we put the kids to bed, Erica said to me, \"I would appreciate it if you don't teach the kids that language Sophie was speaking at dinner.\" So I said, \"I am not teaching Sophie anything, I talk to my kids in Hindi because I want to raise them to be Bilingual and it was important to me.\" Then Erica said, \"But Sophie is there too, so maybe limit it or talk to the boys in Hindi when she is not around.\" I said, \" I don't want to be treated like a prisoner in my own house and I am not doing anything wrong. It's my culture and I want to pass it down. And if you have a problem, then you should take full custody of Sophie.\" Then Erica started crying and left. Now my husband is mad at me because he thinks that Erica will take Sophie away from him. He wants me to apologise, but I don't think I am wrong. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: hi I read some comments and i think that my full custody thing is being misinterpreted because of the way I wrote it. What I meant was that if she had a problem with it she should take more responsibility of Sophie because she usually bails on Sophie even on days she agrees and stuff and I apologised to her for saying it like that and clarified it. But she wants me to not talk to the kids in Hindi because she doesn't want her daughter learning \"that\" language. She had also said a lot of other racist stuff that I missed \n\nUpdate 1: Hi so I read a few comments and I do understand that what I said about custody was out of hand and makes me the ah, but I had realised it the moment I said it and clarified my stance and apologised. About why Erica was at dinner, we usually have a dinner together ever since the Boys were born bec she would be a part of Sophie's life and inadvertently my boys too, so that's why we agreed for dinner twice a month. I was not even talking in Hindi at the dinner table, we were talking about something and Sophie said, \"Offo\" (which is Hindi for oof! And that is what Erica noticed. But I think most of you are right, I should talk to Erica. And my husband did defend me but I think he got upset only when the custody thing was being questioned. \n\nUpdate 2: most of you seem to think I am a woman but I am a man. My husband and I are a gay couple. He is bi",

Your husband is immature and needs to grow up and stop being childish.  He is supposed to support you, not have a temper tantrum because his ex is a racist and he is willing to be silent rather than rock the boat.  I think it is great that she is interested enough to pay attention and try to learn even though you aren't directly teaching her, and her FATHER should be proud of her too.  Instead, he is chewing his nails and fretting like an old lady.  Ugh, is he always like that, or is this new because I'd have never married him if this was his normal way of dealing with conflict.  My ex-fiance was teaching my 9 year old, at the time she is 21 now, Arabic, and I thought it was great. I'm relearning French, Duolingo, and my grandson is really into sitting with me through my lessons.

It\u2019s rude behavior.\n\nWho said anything about it being the primary language? Even so, the ex is not a guest, she lives with OP. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate what language OP speaks in his own home. \n\n>If you only spoke Hindi it\u2019s one thing but you\u2019re clearly fluent in english and your kids will speak both.\n\nYes, which is exactly what the ex has an issue with. \n\n>If your all switching to hindi your doing it so she cant understand you and thats rude af\n\nNothing about this post suggests that\u2019s what happening",
