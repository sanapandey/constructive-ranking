    "selftext": "I (24F) have a friend, Sarah (25F), who recently moved into a new apartment. She reached out to me and asked if I could help her move all her stuff over the weekend, which I didn\u2019t mind at first.\n\nHowever, I realized that in the five years we\u2019ve been friends, Sarah has never helped me with anything significant. I\u2019ve moved twice during that time, and she never offered to help\u2014she was always too busy or had an excuse. I\u2019ve helped her with all kinds of things, from loans to emotional support, but when it came to actually doing something for me, she was never around.\n\nSo when she asked for my help, I told her that I wasn\u2019t available. She got upset and asked if I could just set aside a couple of hours to help. I explained that I couldn\u2019t because I had plans, but also that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable helping her out after how I\u2019ve always been the one to do the heavy lifting in our friendship.\n\nShe started sending me texts saying I was being a \u201cbad friend\u201d and \u201cselfish\u201d, and that I should be there for her just like she\u2019s always been there for me. But honestly, I feel like it\u2019s time for her to put some effort in if she wants my help, especially after the way she\u2019s treated me in the past.\n\nNow, I\u2019m feeling guilty because some of our mutual friends are saying I should\u2019ve just helped since \u201cmoving is a big task,\u201d but I feel like I\u2019ve already been giving too much without getting anything in return.\n\nAITAH for refusing to help her move?",
