    "selftext": "My brother James was married to Elle for 10 years. They had one living child in that time, my nephew Caden (16). Elle had five miscarriages as well and that's something I mention because it will come up later. Caden was only 5 when James died. Before he died James was awarded money for a lapse in medical care which cost him his life ultimately. James wanted the largest part to go to Caden and when he was sorting his estate and final wishes he asked if I would become the caretaker of the money. He had it in a bank account but wanted to be 100% satisfied it would go to Caden alone. He said it wasn't about Elle or how much he trusted her but she would remarry and he had no way of knowing if the man who came into their lives could be trusted. And since he wouldn't get to see Caden grow up he wanted to secure some stability for Caden's future. I agreed and when he died he left me in charge of the bank account with the money. It wasn't put into a trust or anything like that. But only I have access to it.\n\nElle was understanding of everything at the time and we remained on good terms for a couple of years but then things soured a little. It was unrelated to the money but she had started dating someone and when I met him I felt something was off about him. She saw it as me not wanting her to move on. But they broke and it turned out I was right. However the damage to the relationship was done. We were civil for Caden's sake after that.\n\nElle did remarry a few years ago. Her husband has children of his own and this is where the point of the post comes in.\n\nOne of Elle's stepchildren was involved in a near-fatal accident in December while with her maternal grandparents. Elle and her husband were trying to get to her, because she was out of the country. and Elle contacted me to say she needed some of Caden's money so they could go there. She told me she wasn't sure how much in total she'd need by the time everything was sorted but she knew there would be enough to cover everything and still leave Caden with money.\n\nI told her the money was for Caden and Caden alone and I wasn't giving her any of it. That I was sorry for what they were going through but the money needed to come from somewhere else. I spoke to Caden the same day and he asked me not to give any of the money up if asked again. He said he knew his mom was going to keep asking if they didn't get money from anywhere else. I promised Caden I'd keep the money safe.\n\nI was asked again a number of times. Eventually the money did come from somewhere else. But Elle and her husband ended up taking on debt because of her stepdaughter's accident. And Elle is angry that I was sitting on a large sum of money for Caden and wouldn't let her use any of it for a real emergency. She said it was the wrong decision and totally callous.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I realize I forgot where the miscarriages would come in. But Elle has mentioned losing five children to me in an attempt to guilt trip me for not giving her access to the money. She has pointed out she lost her husband, she lost five children and in an emergency where her stepchild could have died I refused to give her even a small portion of the money.",

You could have made clear & had a quick note done up to ensure it was paid back, but at least had plane tickets to get to her bedside.

Whilst it must be challenging for them as a family this is not a free pot of money for them, they should forget it even exists. In fact the only reason it does exist is because your brother was not medically taken care of and died, he literally died for this money.. \n\nPerhaps it is time for it to be moved out of a bank account and into a trust where you can be sure it can only ever be spent on Caden and not be abused by anyone else. \n\nYou\u2019re doing an amazing job, your brother would be so proud of you.",

It was for a trip to see her during her convalescence? Your answer that the money would have to come from somewhere else was completely appropriate - especially as it eventually did.  \n\nIt also sounds as though Elle had no intention of even paying the money back.

Also, consider whether Caden can come live with you when he turns 18, because they will only pressure him more then.\n\nI am certain that Caden asked you not to give them any money, because they were pressuring him, and at least now, he can say that it's not up to him, but one day that will change. A trust that keeps everything locked up will make sure it can only be used for his expenses, no matter what the future brings.\n\nIf you die while Caden is a minor, his mother will probably try to get control of that bank account, and she will use it.",

You honored your brother's intentions with that money.  If it had been an emergency involving Caden you would have released the money.  It was an emergency involving someone unrelated to you, Caden and your brother.\n\nHopefully you didn't tell Elle that Caden asked you to keep the money safe and you didn't tell her that you'd only release it if you had Caden's permission in the future.  I could see her repeatedly asking him to tell you to give her access to his money and then threatening to kick him out if he keeps refusing.\n\nA friend of mine was in a similar position to Caden but his mom had access to the money.  She used it to fund her lifestyle with her new husband.  The problem with that was the money was divided into a Trust and a custodial bank account.  Friend's mom didn't realize that both setups are protected by some pretty robust laws in our state.  When he turned 18 (were all in our early 40s now) there was very little money left because his mom used it to buy a new house, new cars (that she'd replace every three years), and to pay for lavish vacations.  Friend went to have a chat with his paternal grandparents' lawyer and learned that due to the way the laws are written his mom had to account for *every dime* she spent out of both accounts and provide an explanation about how those expenses solely benefitted her son.  She couldn't and the court ordered her to pay him back and they'd waive interest if she started paying back within two years.  She refused and as a result is *still* paying him back twenty-seven years later (she'd stop paying for a year or two until he was able to get her wages garnished).  I still can't believe she told the judge \"He owes me for raising him\" as justification for what she did.",

The kid is 16, and any involvement that OP has to have with her will be done in < 2 years. You're projecting your own situation onto OP and ignoring the realities all in favor of some Kumbaya happy relationship with the woman that has nothing to do with giving the nephews money to OPs SIL for a child that has nothing to do with OPs brother.

And really, not even for her stepdaughter, but for her and her second husband to go to her stepdaughter. Go back and read it, she didn't want a loan, she wanted a gift because the woman said \"still leave Caden with money\".\n\nRaiding your kids inheritance for a stepkid is reprehensible and shows that OPs brother absolutely made the right call, as did OP.",

That\u2019s not what your brother asked of you either. Try to remain neutral/unbiased, your post implies you\u2019re not.\n\nI have to ask, are you callous to her because bad communication (or delivery) is 90% of conflict really. \n\nNTA at all for saying no, that her late husband specifically wanted to ensure other emergencies or happenstances don\u2019t get in the way. You can be empathetic to her situation now and all of it while respecting your brother/her late husband\u2019s wishes.\n\nI think ESH for involving the teenager in this discussion or the like. Not blaming you, maybe mom said it idk - but I\u2019d talk to her about that and agree neither of you let Caden know these discussions. This is to safeguard his well being and relationship with his mom, don\u2019t give him the impression you\u2019re the only one who cares about him when his mom is clearly in distress. Your brother trusted you to be the adult - imho Camden shouldn\u2019t even know about these discussions now (maybe when he\u2019s older and it comes up). Keep it between you and her imho, and have her agree to that. This is absolutely unhealthy for a teenager to be concerned with, he\u2019s already lost a dad and is sharing his mom. Make sure you assure him his stepsis and mom therein are in distress, but everything will be ok. Make sure he knows he can trust his mom, and you\u2019d be there when she\u2019s in distress too not to worry. Rather than give him the sense she\u2019s not to be trusted and you\u2019re all he can trust.",

I get where you\u2019re coming from (and the downvotes) but it\u2019s really OPs to consider.\n\nI never said give the mom the money or OP is in the wrong. \n\nETA: Just tell mom to keep kid out of it.
