    "selftext": "I (24F) have a friend Olivia (25F) who recently got engaged. She\u2019s been with her fianc\u00e9 for a while, and when she told me the news, I was genuinely happy for her.\n\nA few weeks later, Olivia came to me and said that the ring her fianc\u00e9 gave her was too small for her taste and that she was thinking of getting it upgraded. I assumed it would just be something minor\u2014maybe resizing or adding a different band. But then she asked me if I could help pay for the upgrade.\n\nShe explained that she didn\u2019t have enough savings to cover the cost of a new, bigger ring, and that she didn\u2019t want to ask her fianc\u00e9 to foot the bill because she didn\u2019t want him to think she was ungrateful. She said she knew I had some extra money saved from my recent job and was wondering if I could \u201cjust pitch in.\u201d\n\nAt first, I was shocked, then I politely explained that while I totally understand her wanting a ring she loves, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable paying for a part of her engagement ring. I told her I could offer support by listening, or even help with other wedding-related things, but when it came to spending thousands of dollars on a ring, I wasn\u2019t comfortable putting that kind of financial strain on myself.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy with my response and called me \u201cselfish\u201d for not being more supportive of her happiness. She said that since I was doing well financially, it would be a nice gesture to help her out and that it wasn\u2019t like I would miss the money.\n\nNow she\u2019s been distant, and I\u2019ve gotten some odd looks from other friends, who say I should have helped because \u201cit\u2019s just a ring.\u201d But I still feel like it\u2019s not my responsibility to pay for someone else\u2019s engagement ring, no matter how much I care about them.\n\nAITAH for refusing to help her pay for her ring?",

Not her and her friends.\n\nWhen people treat you like this, they\u2019re telling you who they are. They\u2019re showing you who they are. Believe them.\n\nYou need to look these people in the eye go\u2026 Yeah, I have some money saved. For me. Not for your engagement ring. If you can\u2019t afford a bigger engagement ring, then you don\u2019t get one right now.\n\nAnd this is when you put people who do this shit on blast on your social media. You first let Olivia know that she\u2019s asking something unreasonable. You don\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry, because you have nothing to be sorry for.\n\nIn the immediate moment, you literally look at them and ask them\u2026 Are you crazy? I worked very hard for my savings because I have plans for it. And my plans are not so you can get engaged on my dime.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t immediately back off and go\u2026 Yeah, you\u2019re right. It was a stupid idea, then you know they\u2019re not your friend. And when they double down and start to involve other people, that\u2019s when you go to social media.\n\nYou nip this shit in the bud. You post something along the lines of\u2026 Oh, and be sure to tag her\u2026 Because it\u2019s not gonna matter because that friendship is done\u2026\n\n\u201cHey friends and family! I recently had someone I thought was my friend come to me. Her boyfriend asked her to marry him and got her a lovely ring. But it is not big enough for her.\n\nInstead of letting him know that she would like a different ring, she doesn\u2019t want to embarrass him. So she thought it would be OK to come to me and literally ask me to GIVE her my savings that I have worked incredibly hard for so that she could go buy a bigger ring without embarrassing her boyfriend.\n\nI don\u2019t know how she thought her boyfriend wouldn\u2019t notice a change in the ring that he picked out for her. That part doesn\u2019t even make sense.\n\nAs I explained to her, I did work hard for my savings. It has taken me a long time to have some, and I do have plans for my own money. Which do not include buying other people engagement rings.\n\nI was told, in spite of me offering to help with the wedding in other ways, that I am a bad friend. And now I am getting funny looks from my entire friend group. So I don\u2019t know what the story is that\u2019s going around, but that\u2019s what happened.\n\nSo no, Olivia. I won\u2019t be helping you with your wedding. I won\u2019t be attending your wedding. I won\u2019t be sending you a gift. It was incredibly rude and entitled of you to even ask somebody else to buy you an engagement. That\u2019s between you and your fianc\u00e9.\n\nI just wanted to set the record straight. Hopefully my other \u201cfriends\u201d will stop giving me funny looks. And if they feel so strongly that I should give up MY money, they should just start a go fund me for Olivia\u2019s engagement ring since apparently her fianc\u00e9 is too poor to get her the size ring she feels she deserves.\u00a0\n\nFirst world problems. \ud83d\ude44\u201d\n\n\nAnd just to be clear, OP, I\u2019m not joking about this. When people act like assholes, they deserve to be called out. When they start involving friend groups and family members, they doubly deserve to be called out.\n\nQuite frankly, Olivia\u2018s fianc\u00e9 deserves to know how she really feels about the ring that he got her. Because it is one thing to love your fianc\u00e9 and really not like the ring they picked because it is just not your STYLE.\n\nIt is a very different thing altogether to not like your ring because the diamond is too small\u2026 Even though that\u2019s what is affordable at this point in their lives. That\u2019s entitled and greedy. And if you are that kind of a person, your fianc\u00e9 deserves to know.",
