    "selftext": "I (24F) went to a wedding last weekend for my cousin, and the seating chart had me placed at a great table near the front. I was sitting with some family, plus a few people I didn\u2019t know well but seemed nice.\n\nAbout ten minutes in, a girl named Tessa (mid-20s)\u2014who I barely know but is apparently friends with the bride\u2014came up to me and asked if I\u2019d be willing to switch seats with her. She was seated at a table toward the back and didn\u2019t like being \u201cso far from the action.\u201d\n\nI was polite but firm and told her, \u201cSorry, but I think I\u2019ll stay where I am.\u201d She pouted and said she\u2019d rather be near the front because she was closer friends with the couple than some of the people who got seated up here.\n\nI shrugged and told her she could talk to the bride or a coordinator if she had an issue, but I wasn\u2019t moving. She got annoyed and said, \u201cWow, it\u2019s just a seat, why are you being difficult?\u201d\n\nAt that point, I just said, \u201cBecause I was assigned this one.\u201d\n\nLater, I found out she complained to the bride about me, and a couple of mutual acquaintances said I was being a little inflexible and that I \u201ccould\u2019ve just switched to be nice.\u201d But I don\u2019t see why I should have to move just because she decided she didn\u2019t like her placement.\n\nAITAH?",
