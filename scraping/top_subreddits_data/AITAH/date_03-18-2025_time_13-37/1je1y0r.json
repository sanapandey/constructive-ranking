    "selftext": "So, my (19F) boyfriend (21M) and I don\u2019t live together, but we sometimes grab groceries together when I stay over. Last week, I gave him $50 in cash to pick up some basics while I was at work. Later, I asked for the receipt, and he got all weird about it. Turns out, he \u2018accidentally\u2019 spent the money on a new game and said he\u2019d cover the groceries next time.\n\nI told him I wasn\u2019t okay with that since that was my food budget for the week. He got defensive, saying it was an honest mistake, and I was \u2018making a big deal over nothing.\u2019 I said if it was no big deal, he could just give me the money back. He refused, saying I should \u2018let it go\u2019 because he pays for things sometimes too (like, an occasional takeout meal).\n\nI ended up just leaving and buying my own groceries, but now he\u2019s sulking and saying I overreacted.

            "body": "How does he \"accidentally\" spend $50 of someone else's money on a game? The answer is, he doesn't. He did it on purpose, hoping you would let him get away with it. If $50 is your entire food budget for the week, and you had to go buy groceries, without him paying you back, that means you had to take money from a different part of your budget to do so. He doesn't seem to understand this. Were I you, I would be demanding he pay me back. And if he refused, I would be ending the relationship. Look at it this way: he stole from you. He may as well have gone into your pocketbook and taken the money from you. It's the same thing. Would you let a friend or a family member get away with it?",

As we walked around the store (just the two of us) we discussed about $20 interest since he wouldn\u2019t be paying it back super soon since he was unemployed. All was good and we left. I tacked on some extra expenses over the next few weeks for me buying us food and him owing me for his share. 1, he accused me of trying to get more money out of him. 2, he decided that once he got money it would be a great idea to buy an airsoft gun, helmet, and other shit. When I called him out on it he got pissed and said that was stuff that he really wanted for a long time. And i was like dude you literally owe my PARENTS money\u2026 he clearly didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at all. \n\nIn no way am I saying your bf is like this.
