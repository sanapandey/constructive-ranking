    "selftext": "I (24F) have been a tattoo artist for about three years now. I work at a well-known studio, and while I\u2019m not world-famous or anything, I\u2019ve built a solid clientele and take my work very seriously.\n\nMy cousin Emma (22F) has always been super supportive of my work\u2014liking my posts, sharing my designs, and even saying things like, \u201cOmg, when I finally get a tattoo, I\u2019m coming to you!\u201d I always appreciated it and assumed she meant as a paying client.\n\nWell\u2026 nope.\n\nA few weeks ago, Emma texts me and says, \u201cI finally decided what I want! Can you do a half-sleeve for me?\u201d I was excited at first, but then she followed up with, \u201cObviously, it\u2019ll be free since we\u2019re family, right?\u201d\n\nI thought she was joking, so I laughed and said, \u201cHaha, girl, I love you, but I still gotta pay my bills.\u201d She did not find that funny. She said she figured I\u2019d want to help her out since she\u2019s \u2018promoted my work for years\u2019 and that \u201cit\u2019s just ink and a few hours of your time.\u201d\n\nI tried explaining that tattooing isn\u2019t just some casual favor\u2014it\u2019s my literal job. I have to buy expensive supplies, clean my equipment properly, and block out time where I could be working on a paying client. I even offered her a family discount, but she wasn\u2019t having it. She went on a full rant about how I was being greedy and should want to \u201cshare my art with people who actually care about me.\u201d\n\nI reminded her that I have plenty of friends and family members who have paid me without issue because they respect my work. She basically scoffed and said, \u201cGuess I\u2019ll just go somewhere else, then.\u201d\n\nI told her she was more than welcome to, and now she\u2019s been passive-aggressively posting on social media about how \u201cmoney changes people\u201d and \u201csome people let success get to their heads.\u201d\n\nA few relatives are saying I should\u2019ve just done it for free because \u201cfamily is family,\u201d but I honestly don\u2019t think I should have to give away my work just because we share DNA.\n\nAITAH for refusing to tattoo her for free?",
