There's just no point in galactic colonization as people expect based on Earth history. There's nothing out there you need and it's all boring rocks and particles and junk, so advancing to a certain point means just kinda optimizing your presence to nonexistence while making your own little virtual worlds to explore and do stuff with. Why spend all of forever going all the way over there when you can just make your own \"over there\"?",
