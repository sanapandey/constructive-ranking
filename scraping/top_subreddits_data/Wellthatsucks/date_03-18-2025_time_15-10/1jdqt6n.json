I was riding my bike one day and felt something weird on my back, lifted up my shirt to ask a friend if something was there, and all the color drained from his face lmao. I had [this level of a rash](https://midsouthpain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9d23.jpg) (not quite as dense but similar shape/color) stretching from my lower right shoulder down to my lower spine. \n\nTook about eight months to fully go away IIRC, but the pain lasted for two years. I still flinch when people touch my back.\n\nAll that to say: I sure hope other commenters here are right and it's not actually shingles!!",

(Because shingles is a re-activation of the chicken pox virus, but if you never were infected, how does it reactivate ? )\n\nAppears the vaccine uses weakened live virus which can reactivate (as a far lower incidence than wild/natural infection).  TIL. \n\n>The CDC stated in 2014: \"Chickenpox vaccines contain weakened live VZV, which may cause latent (dormant) infection. The vaccine-strain VZV can reactivate later in life and cause shingles. However, the risk of getting shingles from vaccine-strain VZV after chickenpox vaccination is much lower than getting shingles after natural infection with wild-type VZV.\"  \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella\\_vaccine#Herpes\\_zoster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_vaccine#Herpes_zoster)",
