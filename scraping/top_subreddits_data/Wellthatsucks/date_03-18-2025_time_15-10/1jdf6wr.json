I go to quite a few tradeshows (as a vendor) and when I can get a break, I'll go walk the floor and look at what other vendors are offering my industry. So many times I see people sitting in their booth, heads down, just scrolling on their phones. \n\nLike, I get it that they probably aren't the ones paying to attend the show, and they were just assigned to be there, but come on. I assume most people in the booths are sales positions that work on commissions, so why not try to grab people and try to make a buck? You never know who you're going to meet. Some of my biggest customers were literally 2 minute conversations with people I pulled out of the isle. Give them a quick demo of my product and they say \"these are really cool, send me some more info after the show\". Now, more times than not, they're just being polite and they never respond to my follow up, but I have had some who turn around and buy hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of products. Others have passed my info to others who ended up being my customers. \n\nIt helps I am a partial owner of my business, so I probably have more incentive to sell than others, but still. These reps are being paid to sell things, so at least attempt to look like you're selling something! Be presentable! Stand up in the walkway in front of your booth and greet people! Go walk around and try to bring people to your booth! Or go talk to other booths who could be partners of distributors! If nothing else it makes the day go by quicker because you're engaged rather than just doom scrolling on your phone.\n\nIt's also a compounding effect. Every year I go to a tradeshow, I see more and more people that I know, have had meetings with, or are my current customers. They all come by the booth to say hi or discuss new business. New buyers see a bunch of people in my booth and think \"well, they're getting lots of attention, I wonder what they have to offer\" and stop in our booth.",

No signs, apart from the little paper one the conference center to designate the booths that just say \"Booth 1234 Company XYZ\" in black and white. They usually have one or two reps there just sitting there, looking dismayed because no one stops for them, usually just scrolling on their phones. \n\nLike how do you expect to attract customers if you give them no information to go off of as they pass by?
