A few days later we had a little meeting where she told me \u201cI don\u2019t give you the answers so that you\u2019ll put in the work yourself\u201d or some other similar crap. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to stay when I showed her a small binder of things I decided I was going to work on between that assessment and that meeting, to which she replied \u201cI don\u2019t have time to go through everyone\u2019s folder\u201d and basically brushed off any effort I had been trying to put forth.
