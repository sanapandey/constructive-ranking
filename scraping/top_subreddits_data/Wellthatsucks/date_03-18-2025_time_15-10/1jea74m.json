The transfer poool is placed between the two spent fuel pools.\n\nThe tube cutting had an activity of 50ci / 1.8tbq\n\nThe few moments he handled the source gave him enough radiation to be barred from doing any work that may expose him to even the slightest amounts of radiation for at least a year.\n\nIf you swim in the spent fuel rod pools, surface swimming and limited diving is OK, but if you get closer than 2-3 meters of the spent fuel, you will be receiving high doses of radiation.\n\n6 meter water column is enough to bring radiation below the acceptable amounts, most pools will have a column of 12m for contingency.\n\nSwimming close to the rods is dangerous, even with the water between you and the rods.\n\nAs for the OP, yes its fake - you can buy replicas of those for a few bucks. Other than that, at 3540 curie you'd have received an acute lethal dose by the time you were done taking the picture.",
