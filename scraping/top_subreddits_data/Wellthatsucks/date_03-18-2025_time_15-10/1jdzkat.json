    "selftext": "I always have my car in the garage. I left it on the street right outside my house for literally two hours whole rearranging a few things in my garage. Inside were all my gift cards from my party (hidden), my sons $800 boots, his $200 work pants, and a few other things. Literally nothing that screams value to the average person. Came out and saw this. Of course- the insurance company won't cover any of the stolen contents (despite me carrying full comprehensive coverage). So I'm out a deductible, and every single gift card I got for my birthday (which is all I asked for because I have been saving for a few things at costco and amazon). \n\nI stood in the middle of the road and cried. Called the police to make a report. They dropped off a \"club\" anti-theft device and told me they don't investigate break ins. Turning forty and having my car broken into all at once (literally the only time my car has ever been parked outside, and in a decent area) was too much. ",

There's a lawsuit against Kia (and Hyundai) because the vehicles lack proper security/anti-theft mechanisms, making them extremely easy to break into (and steal).  I would go after Kia for the damages.  In addition, you need to get renter's insurance.  Renter's insurance covers lost items inside the vehicle.  Granted none of this advice helps you in your situation right now, being prepared for the future will make future \"adventures\" more bearable.  Sorry for your loss.",

I thought (in my inexperience) that the home deductible would only be necessary to use in the event of floods, tornadoes, etc, and we don't get those often. I just assumed any theft on contents in a car break-in would be covered by the car deductible. Terribly expensive lesson to learn. \n\nAll within a week of my gram going on hospice. I'm just over it all tbh. Waiting for the storm to pass and hoping I don't drown in the process at this point. \ud83d\ude43",

Flood insurance in the US is covered by a separate police issued through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\n\nSome basics you should know: \n\n- if your home is located in what's called the 100-year floodplain, and you have a mortgage, you are required by federal law to have an NFIP policy. This would have come up when you bought the house and would have raised your mortgage payment, so you would definitely know if this was the case.\n\n- 100-year floodplain is a misnomer. Statistically, homes in this floodplain will flood at least once during the typical 30-year mortgage. And 25% of homes that flood are *outside* this floodplain. That simply means that despite our best information and engineering, mother nature will do whatever she wants.\n\n- a few inches of flood water will easily cause $10k damage. A foot or more of water can pretty much \"total\" a house. \n\nContact your insurance agency and ask for a flood insurance quote. There's no obligation to buy it; you're just finding out what the cost would be.  Ask that they include \"contents coverage\" in the quote. They will get an NFIP quote for you and, if you choose to get flood insurance, they'll arrange the coverage through NFIP.",
