You gotta remember that long distance economy usually has slightly (but not that much) more space and usually also (slightly but noticeably) better seats than domestic flights. \n\nBut I fall asleep decently well in airplanes. I just put in headphones with an audiobook (important: really good voice actor, but atleast there are a lot of those in German) and I can just shut off and fall asleep. \n\nEither way in my experience US domestic flights are usually a bad experience anyway. I have flown my fair share of cheap airlines in Europe and Asia as well and while they are also optimized and cheap, the \"vibe\" often feels better. \n\nBut the differences between economy seat comfort on long distance flights is night and day depending on the airline one is flying with. Like I have had some truly terrible seats on some transatlantic KLM and Delta flights, Lufthansa (and the entire Star alliance) is usually pretty good for long distances but some others (Japan Airlines, Korean Air) just have better economy class. \n\nOne small thing: I have flown a lot of business class for work too. I personally would never pay that much extra for it but while the differences are bigger than in economy depending on the airline (also in regards to food, behaviour the staff etc.), I would argue that it matters LESS as all (long distance) business class seats are comfortable enough to sleep and in my experience the food is always decent. After all it's just  a method of travelling, not a prolonged hotel stay. \nFor me personally (as I can fall asleep in economy seats as well) the bigger factor is when I am on a work trip and have a stopover (for Germany it's often Frankfurt) after my long distance flight before taking the short 1h flight back to my home airport: \nIt's just so nice to just stroll into a Lounge in the airport, take a shower, have a decently quiet and calm environment and getting some free acceptable food. Then I get home feeling well instead of feeling \"airplane/travel sweaty/dirty\". \nThis is also nice when I have to take a flight really early in the morning. Stopping by a lounge and having a free coffee and some free breakfast is just nice. \n\nI have a status with Star alliance that allows lounge entry but honestly: you can pay to have access to most lounges just then and there (or book it online)  even if you have an economy ticket. If you have a longer stopover you would probably need to buy some food at the airport anyway. Then the price for the lounges isn't that high anymore and so much more worth it than  a business class flight experience in my opinion.",

If you look around on long distance flights (especially when they are overnight) you will realize that most people are actually sleeping even in the economy seats. \n\nI personally usually have a pillow with me, put in some headphones (I use overhears when watching movies on the plane, but inears when trying to relax or sleeping) and put on some nice audiobook. Then I usually either end up not really noticing the time or (far more often) just very quickly fall asleep. Honestly i might fall asleep faster on planes than at home. I sleep very well once I fall asleep but it can take a while. Probably because I am on my phone in bed, like right now. On a plane I just fall asleep to the rumbling of the engines. \n\nI am also not the tiniest person (but not quite above the 2m mark) but it works fine for me.",

I didn't mention it. Just that batteries have caused fires in the past - both as carry-ons in the passenger compartment and in checked baggage. [Here's an example of the risk of batteries in the cargo compartment (i.e. checked-in baggage or a cargo flight).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y50saxfTqQA) I will have to search for the video discussing cabin fires, but at minimum we know it happened with some of those Samsung galaxy phones.",

A bunch of Asian carriers are banning the use of portable batteries and/or requiring they be kept as a personal item, not in overhead storage. There is also no compelling evidence that merely bringing a power bank on a plane is unsafe, the only risks seem to come from heavy use (in which case it'll be right out in the open to extinguish). In theory it's possible, I suppose, for it to catch fire randomly, but as long as it's in an accessible place, that's really low risk (you can just put it out with a fire extinguisher), but that's why it's not allowed in checked luggage.",
