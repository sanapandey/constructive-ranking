Missing rubber stoppers or misaligned tracks can also increase stress and lead to breakage.\n\n-Thermal Shock: Significant temperature differences across the glass can cause it to expand and contract unevenly, potentially leading to cracking or shattering. However, this is less common in indoor environments",

Took an hour for me to come down and be able to sleep again. \n\nThis was summer in the UK, so temps were fairly stable, nobody had showered that evening.\n\nAs above. Tempered glass just does this sometimes.",
