That's the only reason I feel you could infer that them saying they hope Tesla goes out of business is supporting terrorism.\n\nAlso, the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, are you also going off about ICEs roads and forceful deportations without due process?

There is a lot of ongoing research into this exact question and the answer so far is \"no, if the cars are used to their full life span and properly recycled afterward.\"\n\nThis includes the footprint of fuels burned to generate the electricity for charging, the manufacturing footprint, and in at least one study I read, the footprint for mining the raw materials. But, again, this is technology that is constantly evolving and improving at a pretty rapid rate. And the studies looked at averages instead of individual brands so one could very well be worse than the other. If the US could develop better recycling infrastructure- especially for things like lithium and rare earth materials- it would be unquestionably better for the environment.\n\nAnd I would go digging for those sources I read, but I am tired AF and have a newborn. And I only got access through my school so they might not be available to everyone except the summaries and abstracts on Science Direct or JSTOR (which I hate. I believe these kinds of things should be more widely available). So, I'm apologize in advance for being lazy and not being able to back myself up right now.",

I would be surprised if cheaper filters aren't being used on these Model 3s, or if their owners put cheaper ones in once the factory ones reached end of life.\n\nEVs are actually a lot less likely to burst into flames than ICE cars are. The issues come from when they do go up and you try to put them out, because once one cell gets damaged it can cause a chain reaction through the hundreds or thousands of cells (depending on the car and battery) that will cause the car to keep spontaneously bursting into flames. And you can't put them out with water, they need to be smothered in foam.",

Encouraging vandalism of private property owned by people who may very well be in line with your own political beliefs is fucking pathetic. The cars were already purchased, and Elon already got his money when he sold it to these people. Damaging or destroying a tesla will only mean that the tesla dealer gets more visits from that car owner. Meaning more business for tesla. I like the idea of exercising your right to hold signs in front of the new vehicle dealerships, but destroying regular people's life's work will never be ok",
