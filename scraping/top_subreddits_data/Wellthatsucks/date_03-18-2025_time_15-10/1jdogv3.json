                            "body": "On an American Airlines flight, my MacBook Pro was broken after they forced me to check my carry-on case due to overcrowding. I realized this immediately after landing because the case was severely damaged as well, so I inspected and tested the computer at the airport. Finding it would not boot and had a large dent on the side of its enclosure, I went to the desk to file a claim. The representative told me I could only file via telephone and needed to wait 24 hours to do so. They gave me a phone number and sent me on my way.\n\nWhen I called the number the next day, the representative told me claims could only be filed before leaving the airport after landing.\n\nI was a touring electronic musician at the time and needed my computer to perform. So not only did I lose out on the cost of the broken parts and the case, but l was also not paid for the (now canceled) gig I was in town for.\n\nI learned three things that weekend:\n\n1. Never fly American Airlines again.\n2. Always carry a full backup of my hard drive in a separate bag when traveling.\n3. Never trust someone's word on airline policies concerning valuables. Ask for it in writing and make them sign it.",

So why, if I refer to him as it, wouldn't I say \"it's ball\". Then i have to think long and hard about proper vs improper nouns. At that point, it's just easier to reword the whole dam thing.  \n\nEdit: I was going to let this go, but it's bothering me so here's to clarify the confusion. Possessive nouns end in apostrophe s. The exception to this rule is pronouns. \"It\" is considered a pronoun in this case and so doesn't get the apostrophe. This is what I don't like. It feels odd to me to treat it as a pronoun. The point i was trying to make is that \"it\" is an exception to the possessive apostrophe s rule that I have to consciously think about to get right.  \n\nIt's being a contraction of it and is is beside the point and I agree is easy to remember. It being a pronoun is more complicated and feels wrong to me unless I really think about it.",

The baggage handler and the airport baggage handling system, to most people, are one and the same and that's what I meant.\n\nI've seen, in front of my own eyes, how baggage handlers throw people's suitcases onto the moving conveyors.  On one of those ocassions, flying United, my suitcase was damaged and the damage occurred right in front of me, when checking in, I handed my case at the counter and the handler standing behind the United clerk took my suitcase and, basically, smashed it onto the moving conveyor. I went bananas, especially because i was flying first class and my luggage was added a red sticker for \"priority handling\".  I told them right then and there:  when I get to my destination I'm going to check my suitcase thoroughly because if this is the way you treat someone's property, in front of their own eyes, I don't want to see what happens in the back.  Indeed, when I got my bag at EWR, one of the corners of the suitacase, where the wheels are mounted, was totally busted.  The bagage handler's rage caused the airline quite a few bucks:  they had to replace my expensive case, as I happened to have my purchase receipt handy too.\n\nSoon after that incident, 60 minutes or 20/20---one of those investigative programs---aired an episode of how passengers' luggage are handled by airlines.  Baggage handlers attitude in full display, on camera, perhaps because of the way they are treated by the airlines, or reflecting their own frustrations due to personal problems, or maybe acting up on their own depravity and wanting to damage people's property, just for the sake of doing it---who knows!  The tv report was so outrageous and disturbing that the specific people identified on the videos ended up loosing their jobs and the airlines vowed to crack down on the problem, which costs them millions and millions of dollars a year, which are then passed on to consumers in the form of higher ticket prices.  Several airports were singled out but MIAMI INTERNATIONAL (MIA) took the honor of being at the top of the list (do you remember the scandal of baggage handlers at MIA stealing peoples' items out their suitcases?)---what else is to new, right?\n\nOthers in my own family have gone through the same thing too.  These days, I take photos of my suitcase before handing it to the airline, just in case.\n\nSorry, NO SYMPATHY for baggage handlers FROM ME!",
