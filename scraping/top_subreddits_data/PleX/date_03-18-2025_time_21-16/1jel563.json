Cogeco (IP) doesn\u2019t allow connections to Plex so I need to figure out what to do to get a connection that\u2019s allowed. VPN? Domain masking?\n\nI need help. ",

Do they have any firewall/advanced security junk on your router you can disable?\n\nDid you forward the port 32400 TCP? Maybe try running Plex on a different port (and forwarding it ofc). \n\nYou might be able to change your dns server on your router to get around it.",
