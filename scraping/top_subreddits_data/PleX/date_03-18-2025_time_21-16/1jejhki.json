    "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019ve been using Plex for around 12 years, and it\u2019s worked great for me! \n\nThe other day I was looking for one of my shows and I couldn\u2019t find it. After digging in I realized my libraries are gone, with no way of adding them back. When I go to the setting screen, there\u2019s no library options (picture attached). \n\nAny thoughts on what could be going on? \n\nThanks!",
