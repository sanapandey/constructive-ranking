    "selftext": "I have a large Plex Library hosted on a Synology NAS.  Being a little OCD, I prefer my movie posters within Plex to have -- if available -- the names of the main actors on them.   Currently I do this, I manually change posters for those movies (if the default poster doesnt have them AND they are available.)    \n\nIs there any easier way of doing this?  \nThanks in advance!",
