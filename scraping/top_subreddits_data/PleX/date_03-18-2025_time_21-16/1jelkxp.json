Is there any way to format it so both episodes will show in Plex?",

I used season 03 for the return.\n\nAs for the alternate episode, you can check if the tvdb lists it under specials. I\u2019m on my phone so I can't check now, but it will either have an enter for Season 00 Episode XX, and if not just name the file something like: Twin Peaks - s00e100 - International Pilot Cut.mkv. It will show up under a Season 00 specials section so you can watch it there.\n\nFor TV show extras, some do have episode numbers (s00e01, etc), but if not, I just make it like s00e100 or whatever. That will work to get it to show up in that season 00 folder.",

(Edit: Maybe this is wrong, based on the other comments)\n\nPut the International Pilot as an extra. It's not an alternate version of the pilot. It's not canon and has scenes from later episodes in it. You wouldn't want someone to accidentally watch it thinking that it's better to watch because it's longer. It's not really worth watching unless you're a huge fan and just need to see every little bit of Twin Peaks footage that is out there.",
