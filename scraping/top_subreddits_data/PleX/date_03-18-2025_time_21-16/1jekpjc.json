Looks like horizontal lines with a + in upper left corner.\n\nChoose \"Create Smart Collection.\"\n\nFor the Match, choose Resolution is 4K.\n\nSave as a Smart Collection with desired name.  The collection will be listed on the Collections tab.  Depending on the library settings, the collection may or may not be listed in the library itself.\n\nOption 2:  Separate Library\n\nPlace the media in a separate directory and a separate library.\n\nFor example, if your movies are in /movies, create a second directory /movies-4K.  Move the 4K movies to the 4K directory.  Create a new library, Movies-4K\" and add the /movies-4K directory.",
