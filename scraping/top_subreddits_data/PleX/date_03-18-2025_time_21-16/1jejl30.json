    "selftext": "I have a Synology DS223j that I bought mostly for extra storage, playing music through Plex and just to tinker and learn. I recently started ripping some blu rays and adding them to Plex. When I try to view them, I get a message saying \u201cthe server is not powerful enough to convert this video for smooth playback.\u201d I expected this as my NAS is the cheapest thing Synology makes. My question is, if I upgrade the NAS and pop in the old drives, will everything just work or will I need to rebuild my Plex libraries from scratch? I\u2019m also thinking about buying a desktop computer. Would that ultimately be a better/simpler solution? ",

Would get a screenshot of your dashboard when you're watching something and while it's transcoding, so it'll tell us why it is.\n\n  \nEven a simple Raspberry Pi can handle multiple streams if they're direct play so I wouldnt go about upgrading the server just yet unless you need to upgrade it for a different project or if you absolutely need to transcode.",

My server can handle tons of transcodes and I get it when Im the only one using it, and there is nothing else using the CPU. Ive found that force restarting the app, or even sometimes restarting the phone/iPad fixes the issue.\n\nSince you have an older NAS, its likely the culprit though. You could hook a mini PC up to it and let that handle the server stuff.",
