They can then type '/request' and follow the pipeline that's set up to request a movie or TV show.  They'll then get a DM from the bot letting them know when the download is finished. If you're interested I can screen record a video so you could see how it works.\n\n  \nThe way I set mine up (attaching Discord ID's to each user in Overseerr), Overseerr then logs who requested it. You can also restrict the requesting of 4k video, and set requesting limits, or require approval by you before downloading anything.\n\n  \nI set this up so users could request their own media without my involvement, and without having to open up a port for overseerr for outside connections.

This could be because getting a powerful server is more 'sexy' or they actually want to use their TV's Plex app (lots of reasons - simple setup, just one remote, WAF etc). \n\nI like to think of there being several parts to the Plex environment: the server, the client and your network environment. People tend to concentrate on just one, the server and I do think that issues because they neglect the other two parts. \n\nSimple reason for getting a good client - ideally you want or should aim to be Direct Playing on your local network. A good client helps achieve this. It also means you don't necessarily need a powerful server. For years, I used Plex locally only, with a Synology (that wasn't capable of any kind of decent transcoding at all) and an Nvidia Shield. It played 99% of everything via Direct Play, with the 1% problematic files being ASS subs back in those days.",
