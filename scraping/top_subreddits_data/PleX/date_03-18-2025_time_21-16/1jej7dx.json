You do have to setup the favourites (equivalent of libraries) properly and this can definitely seem a little fiddly. \n\nBut the other benefit of Infuse is that I can access my SMB shares in the same app. This means it will act like a network media player when the internet goes down. Actually, it can also access my Macbook's shares as well as webDAV folders for me.",

Some of them get angry and defensive about it, some people will take you down a dark path full of magical thinking, some will absolutely insist that they must use this software because one file 5-years-ago wouldn't play with Plex but did with Infuse, and then a depressingly small number will admit that it's either just a preference or they paid for a lifetime sub, so since they paid money for it they feel compelled to use it.\n\nEdit: See, one of the angry defensive people downvoted me.",
