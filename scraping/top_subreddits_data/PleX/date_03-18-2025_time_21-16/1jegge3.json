            "body": "I don't know of a Plex setting that will choose between SRT and ASS (or any other subtitle type) of the same language. \n\nHere's the KB article I found that has information:  \n[https://support.plex.tv/articles/200471133-adding-local-subtitles-to-your-media/](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200471133-adding-local-subtitles-to-your-media/)\n\nPlex recommends adding .forced to the end of the file name to make that external subtitle be the default. It seems like the easiest way to handle this.\n\n>Forced Subtitles\n\n>Sometimes, you may have a video where you have subtitles for \u201cforeign\u201d parts. For instance, in Star Wars, Greedo or Jabba the Hutt speak alien languages, so you may see subtitles for those \u201cforeign\u201d parts, even if the rest of the dialog in the movie is in your regular language. Those are \u201cforced\u201d subtitles. By setting a subtitle as \u201cforced\u201d, it allows Plex to try and be smart and to enable it for you, even if the audio is already in your preferred language.\n\n>You specify this by adding\u00a0forced\u00a0to the subtitle filename:\n\n>Movie\\_Name (Release Date).\\[Language\\_Code\\].forced.ext\n\n>Movies/Movie\\_Name (Release Date).\\[Language\\_Code\\].forced.ext\n\nI usually re-mux the MKV file inserting the subtitle I want as forced and default. That should make it be chosen first. \n\nI don't use the automatic language choices in Plex and use the Default and Forced settings exclusively because of issues like this. Plex is trying to help, but it makes a mess of things usually.",

This makes PMS prefer the .ass tracks.",

Most of my media is self-ripped, however. \n\nI think that .forced option might be more elegant in your situation rather than removing the language code. That way the SRT still shows Tukish but Plex still prefers the ASS subtitle. Of course, it's up to you on how you handle it. \n\nSorry I couldn't find a better option for you.",
