    "selftext": "For context, I am upgrading (moving) my Plex Media Server to my Mac Mini M4. I have a 20TB Seagate HDD for my general library and a 1TB Samsung T9 SSD that I want to dedicate strictly to metadata.  I do not wish to carry over my old (NVIDIA Shield Pro) metadata, I want to start fresh.\n\nCan I just point to the 1 TB external via Settings > Scheduled Tasks > Backup Directory ? If so, what would I put in that blank, if for example, the folder I wanted on my 1 TB path was \"/Volumes/Samsung T9 1TB/Plex Metadata\"?   \n\nI tried figuring this out via google but the only thing I found was *backing up* metadata. I am kind of a noob when it comes to using terminal on mac, so I had a hard time understanding how to do a symbolic link. The naming replacement confused me. If this is the only way, can someone eLi5 this method? Please!",
