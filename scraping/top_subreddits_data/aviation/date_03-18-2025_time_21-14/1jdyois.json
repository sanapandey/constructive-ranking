I said I don't need a visa I'm only staying 30 day. They said yeh but your entire journey is 31 days??? I was like that doesn't make sense, I won't be there more than 30 days. I had to pay \u00a3600 for another flight to come back 2 days earlier, then they printed my boarding pass. Then I cancelled the \u00a3600 flight and flew back on the original flights, no questions asked.\n\nI went onto online chat to complain, they pretty much said you flew the flights what are you contacting us for! The live chat was unbelievably ignorant, and I only got half the money refunded from the 600 flight. Assholes",

            "body": "More than likely, there is a problem with the PSU (Passenger Service Unit), which is the area over the seats that contains the lights, ventilation, oxygen mask systems, etc.  For example - if the oxygen mask box latch is broken, none of the masks will drop in an emergency, so the whole row must remain unoccupied.  Usually, if there is a problem with a single seat (seat belt broken, recline mechanism non-functioning, etc.), then just that one seat will be blocked off.",
