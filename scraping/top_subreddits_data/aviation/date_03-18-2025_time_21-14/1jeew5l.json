Meet the Avro Ashton.\n\nBasically, Avro took a few of their Tudor piston airliners and stuck four engines (the same ones that ended up in the MiG-15) under the wings. In double-up pods. This meant it was hot, almost as hard to maintain as a Comet, slow as hell and weird to fly.\n\n\nOH and they tried to make it carry bombs.",
