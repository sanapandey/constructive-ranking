ISR platforms tend to be incredibly costly and they would definitely be something you avoid trying to lose, and in this case the crew for one are likely more disposable than the equipment itself, depending on their role.",

Tankers and ISR are more valuable than (some of) their crews because it\u2019s relatively easy to find/train someone to fly racetracks in a glorified airliner all day, it\u2019s a lot more difficult and expensive to take that airliner, stuff it full of complicated and expensive SIGINT kit, and teach people how to use it. For example, there\u2019s a grand total of 20 RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT aircraft. That\u2019s it. 17 belong to the USAF, 3 to the RAF.\n\nA single RIVET JOINT costs about \u00a3200 million.

But.\u00a0\n\nPilots were absolutely something that was an accepted loss. For any given mission there was an expected loss percentage. Both in air frames and crews. So the question was whether the mission was worth those air crew lives- and the answer was often yes.\n\nIt\u2019s not a comfortable fact, but every object has a price tag in human lives attached to it. And if you\u2019re in war, sometimes you\u2019re the price a commander is willing to pay. Even if you\u2019re a pilot.\n\nAnd since we\u2019re talking about WW2, something like a quarter of all US deaths were Army Air Corp. WW2 specifically is a great example of a war in which pilots were expected to die in mass quantities. Which is why we trained them in mass quantities. Course the US did kill something like a dozen aircrew a day in training accidents. Industrial warfare is a brutal affair\u00a0",

It occured to me that all of these remaining men must be extraordinarily old and that number would continue to starkly drop over the next few years- and, one day very soon, none of them would remain.\n\nWithin five years of me seeing that flyer and reflecting on the implications of that lowly number, Frank Buckles, the last surviving American WWI veteran, passed away at the age of 110.  An era had truly ended.\n\nI have that same feeling now that I had over 20 years ago.  As of today, \\~65,000 American WW2 veterans are still alive, .5% of those who served.  That number may seem massive compared to the number of WWI veterans alive in 2006, but keep in mind that just a little over a year ago there were still over 100,000 American WW2 veterans still with us.  The number has nearly halved in the span of a year, and the rate they'll pass from this world will only increase with time.  In 10 years?  Very few will remain.  15?

I met him only once, but it was a very interesting meeting. He talked not about 'world war 2', but about 'the war times'. He asked if I knew he had been there on D-day, as if it wasn't obvious my friend would have told me. He was very humble about it. As if it was nothing too special, just something he'd done in his youth that he was a little proud of.\n\nOne story he told me is one of the funniest things I've ever heard. Soon after joining the Royal Navy, his ship was returning from some mission, and a civilian fishing vessel passed them by so close that the navy ship had to veer away to avoid collision. The commanding officer asked if any of the men had recognized the vessel, and my friend's father said it was fisherman so and so from Douglas. The officer asked him, next time he got home, to send the fisherman a message for him. That he was impressed with the man's steering ability and good eyesight, and that he was looking forward to an invitation to his parents' wedding (In other words, he was calling the fisherman blind and a bastard).",
