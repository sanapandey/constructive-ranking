    "selftext": "# OUR RULES ON POLITICS\n\n# IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS POST, YOU RUN THE RISK OF GETTING PERMANENTLY BANNED.\n\n**All political discussion must pertain to the world of Aviation.**\n\nAgain: **All political discussion must pertain to the world of Aviation.**\n\nOnce more, for those in the back: **All political discussion must pertain to the world of Aviation.**\n\nThis means politics are only to be discussed within the context of Aviation.\n\nDo you love and support the left? We don't care. Do you love and support the right? We don't care. Are you a Libertarian? We don't care. We are unpaid mods here that enjoy AVIATION, not push agendas, get into political slap fights, or deal with a bunch of political shit. If you want a political discussion, go to any of the numerous other political subs. We are a sub about Aviation. We are not a sub about politics.\n\n**We do not allow political adjacent discussion, antagonistic political discussion, or discussion of political figures.**\n\n# FAQ\n\n**What political/regulatory discussions are ok?**\n\nDiscussions around regulations, changes in laws, opinions on those changes, and general discourse on the rules and regulations that may affect Aviation are open game and should be actively discussed.\n\n**Things like this are fine:**\n\nThere are rumors that the FAA will make a wholesale change to ATC systems.  This concerns me.\n\nThere is/was a major cutback on staffing levels at the NTSB.  What will this do to aviation?, I'm super concerned that accident prevention will go down and accident levels will rise.\n\n**Things like this are not:**\n\nI've heard doge boy and orange man are going to run around and fire people at the FAA.\n\nSleepy Joe Biden has fucked the entire ATC system into the ground.\n\n**Why don't you allow politics?**\n\nWe decided long long ago that politics just aren't worth the shit show they bring. When someone mentions Biden or Trump or Obama or Clinton, or one of the numerous wars or political bullshittery going on, a lot of people from outside the subreddit come in to argue political points and push agendas. We are not here to moderate that type of discussion, and if you as a user want that discussion, you can find it basically anywhere else on Reddit.\n\n**Why don't you change the rules?**\n\nWe are a subreddit about Aviation, so it wouldn't make sense for us to be a political subreddit. We know Aviation oftentimes connects to current events, and we'd love you to discuss that - just keep it within the context of Aviation.\n\n**But Orange Man is Bad!**\n\nAgain, we don\u2019t care about your political position.\n\n**But Biden is Sleepy!**\n\nSee the comment above this one.\n\n**But is it allowed when I\u2019m only trying to fan the flames of DeMoCrAcY and PrOtEcT OuR FrEeDoMs!!**\n\nSimply put, no. We will still remove the post because all this will do is fuel the fire and draw more political comments.\n\n**I got banned for politics. What do I do?**\n\nFirst off, you should read this post. A link to this post may be included in your ban message. Once you have read this post, respond to the message and tell us you have read this post and are sorry for breaking the rules. So long as you aren't a dick about it, you will get unbanned. **An apology will get you far.\u00a0 We\u2019re not in the business of banning regular sub users.**\n\n\\*Credit to u/The_32.",
