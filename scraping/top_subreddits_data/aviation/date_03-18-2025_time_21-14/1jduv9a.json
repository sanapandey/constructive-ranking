The complex gearbox configuration of the V22 has directly caused a handful of crashes, and might have contributed to a few crashes caused by engine failures, but the causes are mixed. Overall, the V22s accident rate also isn't significantly different from other Helicopters, it only seems outrageously high if you compare it with fixed wing aircraft.\n\nThere is also no real way to avoid such a mixing box. With its prop configuration, it is highly unlikely it would be able to even fly horizontally with only one operational prop, and any landing attempt would have to be flown with both propellers stopped, or via autorotation.  \nIf an engine failure happened during a hover, the aircraft would almost certainly be doomed.  \nTurbine Engines are generally pretty reliable, but having two of them also doubles your failure rate. I can't find numbers for the specific engines in the Osprey, but other engines regarded as very reliable claim roughly [333,000 hours per shutdown ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_Canada_PT6)over the long term. Double that failure rate, and you'd expect at least 4 such events over the V22s operating history - probably many more.",

It doesn't have enough power to add during an autorotation. It just has a little power to start turning the engine up and providing electrical power before the engines spool. Unless you're at a helicopter's max altitude when the engine quits, there isn't enough time to restart the engine. You start falling FAST.",

In a country like Sweden that has long distances between the north and the south, it takes quite a long time for helicopters to fly and pick up a patient from a hospital to transport it to another. So they use airplanes to transport patients that need be transferred from hospital to hospital instead. This means using an ambulance or hospital transport vehicle to get them to an airport before flying them. Getting an AW609 to fly directly from the hospital to another hospital would shorten down the transport time and reduce the number of vehicles used while also reducing patient stress. The cabin is also relatively large which means that you can bring a lot of equipment to keep the patient alive. \n\nThis helicopter would not be used to pick up injured people to take them to the hospital though as that is better done by a smaller helicopter like the H145, AW169 or even the AW139",

Like all tools, it can do one job well or several mediocre. \n\nAdditionally, while the osprey is considered one of the safest, it also ranks the highest as the worst outcomes in an emergency.

Maybe you should read your previous comment and get back to me on whether 'it's bad at autorotation' is the same as 'you can kiss your ass goodbye with a single engine failure.' Because what google AI isn't telling you there is that to be in an autorotation landing in a V-22 you need to have either *both* engines fail or you need to have one engine fail and a gearbox failure.\n\nJesus Christ, I can't believe this is the depths to which discussion has sunk - literally just copy-pasting an AI with zero critical thinking.\n\nYou can read about autorotation in the NATOPS. The odds of a positive outcome are low for *any* autorotation landing. That's what pilot training is for. That's why the engines are crosslinked, so it takes at least two independent failures before an autorotation is even worth considering.\n\nThe V-22 only rates that high (which, by the way, it doesn't - in FY07-FY21, the period for which the Osprey was in service with the USAF to the most recent published data I have, the V-22 lost 32 souls - and the UH-60 lost 55) because of being pressed into early service and because it flies with a larger complement almost every single flight. Crew of 4, like a Black Hawk, but 24 troops in the back - versus 11 for a Black Hawk. Or you could just ask the USMC - they say the Osprey has 2.27 Class As per 100k flight hours - the CH-53 has 5.66. \n\nOh, and spare me the 'jack of all trades, master of none' bullshit. The Osprey is slightly worse at autorotation and in exchange you get to glide, you get to fly at half again the speed and for half again the range of a typical helicopter, and you get to carry more payload.\n\nFinally - let's look at the 'many more options' you have in... whatever hypothetical airframe you're looking at. You're flying a plane, engine goes out - great, one engine landing, gonna suck but workable. You're flying an Osprey, engine goes out - *exactly the same*. You're flying a helicopter, engine goes out, same deal - and the Osprey is *the same* or slightly worse, in helicopter mode, except oh boy, the Osprey isn't limited to flying like a helicopter, because they can tilt the rotors and fly home on a single engine. They can glide on no engines, or autorotate, just like a helicopter. Yeah, they're worse than helos at autorotation - but they're a damn sight better at gliding, and that's important.\n\nSo, please - what more options do you have in a helo that aren't outweighed by having new options in the Osprey?",

People must really like going fast and landing anywhere to go against all of commercial aviation's redundancies and slap two single points of failure on an airplane and say 'Don't worry, we checked it\"\n\nEDIT: I see I failed to communicate clearly that I was comparing this to what I know of dual engine fixed wing aircraft. Which is wrong since this aircraft is not trying to be that. Compared to other rotorcraft, I understand better now how this can be vastly superior to current helicopter operating limits and provide more recovery options during failures, which is likely to be very impactful to the industry.",

But to put in in perspective, there's a million 'single point of failure\" things in mechanical design, that can be so reliable that it's okay to trust it. And with time and experience and constantly developing engineering knowledge, eventually tilt rotor systems \\*can\\* be made safe enough for people to trust.\n\nExamples of single failure points: single engine aircraft (Cessna 208s over water all over the world), jack-screw horizontal stabilizers on aircraft (Alaska Airlines 261), nose landing gear (JetBlue292), car seatbelts with a single latch point (very reliable, no redundancy), helicopter tail rotors, etc. etc.\n\nIf they prove useful enough, tilt rotor design will eventually be refined to the point where they're as safe as any other air travel, (which, by the numbers, they are, compared to other helicopters).",

But also that it was simply not finished, the marines got wind that congress was going to cancel the programme so they took delivery early and put it into service to prevent that. \n\nBoeing also out an aeroplane team in charge of the avionics and instruments, so the cockpit was designed like a plane's instead of a being like a helicopter's.\n\nThe instruments not providing the pilots with enough information has been a constant issue, like with the most recent crash. The gearbox sensors were detecting that vibrations in the gearbox were above safe limits but they were not connected to any display so they pilots didn't know, this data could only be downloaded by techs on the ground.\n\nA lot of lessons have been learnt from the osprey which can be seen on the V-280 valor, such as the fix engines with only the rotor tilting, this reduces the complexity and wear of the gearbox.",

An engine is 1000's of single points of failure in a single package. To bet your life solely on one engine is one thing, but to then take another one, slap it on the platform and require it to function to fly means that neither engine can fail, doubling the failure risk without providing redundancy. I guess its still better than a helicopter.",
