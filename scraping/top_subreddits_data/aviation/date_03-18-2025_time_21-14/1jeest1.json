Big strike fighter like F35+ so to say, yeah maybe, but this layout just doesn't lend itself to air superiority. You can't quickly rotate in any direction really, even the outter engine intake isn't positioned for any type of climb or turn rate, being obstructed from above with no variable intake from what I can tell.\n\nStrike fighter would also make a lot of sense in the modern world tbh as well as sound reasonable for Chinas potential needs around the Soth China Sea. Who knows.",

Perhaps with two piston powered backup -power engines to power the outer fans in case the centre turbine fails. \n\nThis may work out better on an airliner, to achieve high efficiency (not for the IR-stealth mixing idea you propose). With heavy lift bombers probably two or three jets is a power that can be put to use, and militaries don't really care about efficience except that it affects range.",

And going 3 engines with that power ratio doesn\\`t look efficient and logical. Because you need extra wiring, extra control units, extra everything that adds up to the weight. On top of that you get extra faulty points, On top of that each engine is not efficient so you get more weight over power ratio, for example 3 engines will most likely weight more than 2 engines and will provide very similar or not really needed power gains compared to the two engines. Also this is not a fighter jet, this is a bomber. So they need to be as efficient as possible to carry huge loads over long distances. 3 engines mean more jet fuel used... \n\nFrom my point of view this design has too many illogical things about it.",

In a two-engine configuration, they probably found it impossible to achieve all three at once:\n\n- larger, more efficient turbofans can achieve the higher MTOWs and lower IR signatures, but won\u2019t be durable enough for high-G maneuvers\n- smaller diameter engines might be able to be able to technically achieve the MTOW and can better withstand maneuvers, but have to operate at higher power settings (i.e. hotter) during normal cruise, compromising stealth\n- and obviously running smaller diameter engines at a lower setting results in a failure to haul the loads required\n\nHence, why I think the J-36 uses three engines. If it were up to me, they should be developing a dedicated deep-strike steath bomber (like the B-21), rather than a(nother?) multirole strike fighter (which is what this looks like to me).",

Multirole to the point of being a Main Battle Aircraft concept.\n* The J-50 is their more conservative, air-superiority design. It has 2 engines to be safe, but similarly lacks vertical stabilisers to maximise stealth. Its probably also their only carrier-capable option.\n\nIt doesn't seem like a problem with development focus because they somehow have the budget to explore all options at the same time.",
