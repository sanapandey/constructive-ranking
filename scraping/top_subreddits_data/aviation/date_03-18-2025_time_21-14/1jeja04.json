There were 3 or 4 rusting away in Sausalito when Indiana Jones producers wanted a stand in for the Boeing Clippers used before and during WW2. \n\nThey hauled the least rusted to Oakland and scavenged engine parts to rebuild one engine.  You see that engine startup in the film.  It is only a few seconds long as the engine blew up just then. \n\nMy 10 yo son got to sit in Indys seat and wear his hat l.\n\nThen he got to help the docent button up the plane for the night. He crawled through the tunnel in the cockpit to close the front mooring hatch. Not many kids get to do that.",
