In fact, the SWA 3472 final report specifically says, \"The fan case had no through-hole penetrations and showed no evidence of an uncontainment.\"\u00a0Also, SWA 1380 is commonly, but erroneously, described as an uncontained failure, despite being, by FAA definitions, a contained engine failure. Subsequent damage to the cowl caused a piece of it to impact the fuselage, which led to airframe damage and decompression that resulted in the death of one passenger.\n\nLet me quote the SWA 1380 investigation report:\n\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 33-5, \u201cTurbine Engine Rotor Blade Containment/Durability,\u201d was issued on June 18, 1990, to provide guidance on acceptable design and test methods for compliance with Part 33 requirements regarding turbine engine fan blade containment. According to the AC, \u201ccontained\u201d was defined as \u201cno fragments are released through the engine structure, but fragments may be ejected out of the engine air inlet or exhaust.\u201d Also, the AC defined \u201cengine structure\u201d as the \u201cstructure surrounding the main rotors and extending from the forward-most case flange through the rear-most flange, as defined by the type design.\u201d In addition, the AC provided the engine configuration, conditions, and acceptable results for fan blade containment tests.",

In fact, they are tested to show that the cowl will contain a blade failure.\n\nI am aware. It doesn't always work though, and it's absolutely impossible for a fan disc to be contained by the casing. These old slim jim engines had the same containment requirements, engineers didn't just suddenly wake up in the 70s and realise containing fan blades would be a good idea. And before anyone says \"but discs are designed not to fail\", that is 1) Not correct (extremely remote =/= never) and 2) doesn't guarantee they don't (see QF32 and AF66 for two highly publicised recent examples). \n\n>If you're referring to SWA 3472 or 1380 (the only two accidents that come up in the 2010s when I search \"737 uncontained engine failure\"), neither one was \"uncontained\" in that the fan containment was not breached. \n\nTechnically yes, neither were uncontained. However both generated high enough energy secondary debris to penetrate the fuselage, and in one case cause a death as a result. Both of those failures, had they occurred during an FBO test, would have constituted a failure of an FBO test. The FAA ordered Boeing to redesign the parts responsible for the failure chain.",

It'll need some way to compensate for the fact that engine thrust is pushing from a different point than the previous engines. It's not just that the planes had MCAS that was the reason for crashing, rather it was a combination of two critical flaws:\n\n1. The pilot training for the new MCAS dynamics was minimal to avoid extensive and expensive training. They wanted airlines to be able to pick up a Max and keep pilot training time down to let them start flying the new planes ASAP. This wasn't enough training to understand how to overcome a system when flaw 2 appeared.\n2. MCAS only received input from one external sensor. In both crashes, the sensor was knocked off (bird strike IIRC), causing MCAS to erroneously control the pitch of the plane. Due to flaw 1 above, the pilots couldn't overcome the system's bad inputs before the crashes. I believe there are other instances where pilots were able to overcome/override MCAS and safely continue flying, before the lawsuits and re-engineering of the system.",
