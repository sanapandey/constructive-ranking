Against the backdrop of the intensifying global hypersonic weapons race, this move not only consolidates France's strategic autonomy, but may also affect the military balance in Europe and even the world, and arouse the attention and response of other nuclear powers. In the future, this development may promote NATO allies to strengthen cooperation and accelerate the modernization of the global nuclear arsenal, profoundly affecting the international security landscape.",

I've actually spent more words speaking about drone war.\n\nI'm signalling two arguments related to 6th gen : 1) 5th gens are merely starting their shelf life 2) F-35 program is showing how complicated it is to make a plane that technologically advanced with hundreds of subcontractors in a dozen countries, with a ROI and dependencies that are emerging as weak spots.\n\nI've nowhere said 5th gen is this or that, I've said that current example of 5th gen (which coincidentally is the F-35) is showing the limits of going full high end and tech, thus let's not assume anything for 6th gen yet.",

The point was projecting the 6th gen.\n\nThis is pure empirism, you are telling me \"if this was done somewhat different then that would happen\", I'm telling you \"based on current example and situation in Ukraine\". Everyone is seemingly going full tech for their 5th gen, and everyone is seeing now that drones can do a good chunk of the work at a ridiculous fraction of the cost\n\n *this is my point right there*\n\nAnd no btw, VTOL is part of the iceberg but doesn't hide the reste of the issues. there are problems with the electronics due to weather, problems with the commands and sensors, problems with the stealth paint, problems with the headset, problems with software updates and we can count and count. VTOL doesn't account alone for doubling the cost per flight hour versus what was announced, which was already twice the rate of 4/4.5 Gen.\n\nWhich of these is not 5th gen ? Stealth ? Sensors and computer commands ? Software? Sensitive electronics ? Futuristic ultra high tech headset ? \n\nOnly one version out of three is VTOL, the others still add to the bill and the overshoots.",

Even against capable enemies (like Iran), they have their place, such as by carrying long-range missiles or by carrying a lot of ordnance. \n\nWhat is important is that all indications are that 6th gen fighters will be incredibly expensive. For example, NGAD is currently at around 300 million per plane, more than 3 times more expensive than F-35. It does not seem reasonable that any country will become fully 6th gen, but with a lot of 5th gen and possibly 4th gen for decades to come.",
