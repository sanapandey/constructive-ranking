Maybe, maybe not but his first thought is always about his people and that has to count for something.  Move the seat of the High King to Whiterun and have Balgruuf sit upon it.  \n\nHe has an Imperial Steward.  He has a Dark Elf as his housecarl.  He has a Redguard in his inner circle even if he is a pompous jackass.  Clearly this is a leader who likes to draw on different perspectives from his people.\n\nI cannot possibly go against him and see him deposed.  That would surely be a dark day for Skyrim.",

Ulfric's post-civil war dialogue makes it clear that he doesn't intend to face the future alone.\n\n\nLastly, it is the Empire that desperately needs Skyrim, not the other way around.",

The Dunmer are offended by the Empire and the Nords in particular and are unlikely to be very against the transit of the Dominion army in exchange for help in rebuilding the cities. \n\nFalkreath is also located next to the safest passage to Cyrodiil, which has already let huge armies through more than once, both in one direction and the other.\n\n Allies? Of the real allies, I can only assume Hammerfell, simply because they are the only ones who feel similar hatred towards the elves. After the breakaway of Skyrim, the Empire will economically crush them, this is logical, there is no point in expecting help from them. Who else is Morrowind? It is unlikely that the Dunmer abandoned by the Empire will cooperate with the Nords, after their warm welcome in Windhelm. Who else?",

I don't think you understand how hard it is to navigate the waters around Skyrim.\n\n\nThe Dunmer are xenophobic against everyone and they never had a good relationship with the Altmer anyhow. They won't be happy about foreign forces crossing their territory.\n\n\nThe Dark Elves might be desperate enough to accept a bribe, this is true, but that also opens the possibility of a temporary alliance with the Nords, assuming they make that offer of reconstruction first.\n\n\nTheir historical animosity didn't prevent the forming of the Ebonheart pact, for instance.\n\n\nNo, not just Hammerfell, because alliances aren't made from friendship alone. A good trade deal could bring support from Orsinium (whose ties with the Empire are uncertain in the 4th Era), Black Marsh, Morrowind or even some kingdoms of High Rock.\n\n\nAnd again, you seem to assume that Skyrim trades with no one but Cyrodiil. That makes no sense.\n\n\nIf trade promises aren't enough, you'll have a common threat when the Dominion starts making its move. The Nords will say: \"Do you wanna be next? Then join us\".",

If you think that Aldmeri won't want to use Morrowind for their own purposes if Skyrim becomes an acute independent problem, then at least you explain why. \n\nRegarding the troop transfer, it's very strange to hear that. Because Dunmer and Aldmer are essentially the two most magically advanced races in Tamriel. If they don't come up with some kind of portals, then they can always make a land-based troop transfer. Yes, it's hard, but it's not impossible, they were able to besiege Cyrodiil from almost all sides, which means they are clearly capable of approaching Morrowind peacefully.  \n\nAnd yes, why if one direct descendant of Hlaalu lives in Windhelm then the entire Dunmer population is necessarily descended from Hlaalu? But what about the rootless Dunmer, those whose lineage does not extend from a specific house, but goes back to several? Are they not a people? Is the council not responsible for them? Representatives of all houses fled Morrowind one way or another, this is a fact. If the conditional descendants of Redoran left Windhelm and went further, this does not reduce the guilt of the Nords in the eyes of the Dunmer people.",

Technically, the offended Dunmer, after the eruption on Red Mountain, should be terribly offended by the empire, which abandoned them with both the eruption and the Argonian uprising. But they should also be offended by Skyrim and Ulfric in particular, because he treats the Dunmer refugees like trash. The Dunmer are a proud people and they don't forgive offenses for a long time. So despite the possibility of establishing a supply chain Windhelm-Ravenrock, I doubt that the actions of the Dragonborn can be regarded as a gesture of politeness from Ulfric. In general, he does not behave like a far-sighted politician. More like a general of a warlike army.",

As the lore says, everyone who could and wanted to do so fled from the catastrophe. In addition, we should not forget about the rootless, whose blood does not flow directly to one of the great houses. All of them are under the attention of the Morrowind council. The refusal to accept the elves with dignity as allies and brothers, the refusal to help neighbors, this is still a Nord slap in the proud face of the Dunmer people. So no. I still don't think that they will fall for this and will enter into any agreements with the Nords and people in general. I would not be surprised at all that the Dunmer, fueled by revanchist sentiments, do not sign treaties with the Dominion. The Altmer fought with everyone who betrayed the Dunmer, and as the saying goes, \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\"",

Ulfric stands firmly as a nord, equiped with shouts and stubborness that few of his fellow Jarls have. \nWe see the battle born parading their gold and status, while the whitemanes live on the respect of their ancestry, but they don't have gold. \n\nUlfrics ideology is cruel, but relevant, and understandable.",

I do not understand what he is fighting for. Is he fighting for the people? But he literally killed the High King, allowing a schism in Skyrim and is drowning his homeland in blood. \n\nIs he fighting for the faith? But his faith is truly false, moreover, he is an oathbreaker, because he violated the path of the voice he was taught, literally went against the customs of his ancestors for which he is so worried. Is he looking for justice? But he drowned markarth in blood in that story with the forsworn, he attacks Balgruf and whiterun, a city that he simply did not want to stain with blood.\n\n I do not judge ulfric by the words of the imperials, I try to judge him by his actions and this man will go over heads to achieve his ghostly goals, moreover, he is short-sighted and often with his actions he only helps his enemies who use him. so in my opinion ulfric is a good option for the \"evil\" dovahkiin.",
