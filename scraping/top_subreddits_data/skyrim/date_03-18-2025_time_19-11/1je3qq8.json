I don't even use crashlogger anymore because I add like 3-5 mods at a time and check in game if its working correctly and MCM loads. \n\nI started on Immersive and Epic when it was maintained so my 4090 computer has that modlist which I heavily modified and updated which taught me alot but its on 640 version of the game running BHUNP.\n\nNow my 3080 TI build has the 1170 version of the game with 3BA. I have not found a good reason not to just update my original PC to 1170 but alas I would rather not start over. \n\nI only have like 2 mods that are fixes and even if a specific mod needs its own fix its just a patch not going to take up load order. I play to have waifu followers like my mod [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143163?tab=posts&jump\\_to\\_comment=151561082](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143163?tab=posts&jump_to_comment=151561082) \n\nIf you're asking like how did I genuinely get to this point. A lot of reading, trial and error. I started as a trouble shooter for Immersive and Epic discord, There was a issue in Screen Archer for Skyrim (similar to F04) that was driving me nuts. Turns out the issue was Smooth Cam. I have not had to make 1 single loot SSeedit or bash in my last 3 years. I either fix load order, disable something, set a rule in Vortex for it. I use Vortex which for me was easier than Mo2 which I still havent used but im sure has its own benefits. There are a lot of abbreviations that people use that even I use that come naturally and honestly there are a lot of things people expect you to know, which even I don't like I actually don't know how to make my own patches. Never had to. But I do know how to change dialogue conditions and other easy stuff for followers so they say stuff at certain times or places.",
