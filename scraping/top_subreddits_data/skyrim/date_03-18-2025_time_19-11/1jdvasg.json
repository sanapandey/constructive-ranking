It's something to do with dragons so it's something to do with the main quest.\n\nNow I'd figured out the likely explanation for the dartwing and the book but I couldn't figure out how the dragon scales had got there. Then I was going through Morthal on my way to Windstad Manor.  I still had one piece of Mehrune's Razor to collect and it was the hilt from Jorgen. It was the middle of the day and Jorgen was outside. I stopped to speak to him and noticed he had some dialogue options to do with the Pieces of the Past quest, so I backed out of the conversation and made a save.\n\nI then had a conversation with him and managed to persuade him to just give me the hilt. I wanted to get some sneak, pickpocket and lockpicking xp from the quest so I reloaded so I could come back at night and steal the hilt.\n\nAs I was riding across the marshes going to Windstad Manor I was thinking about what Jorgen said when he let me take the hilt. He said, \"*My family wasted 8 generations keeping this that Razor safe from a dead cult. s far as I care, it can stay locked in my house.*\" Then I had an epiphany - the dragon scales are a family heirloom!\n\nSo in the area of Rorikstead, where will you find blue dartwings, books and a deceased family? Lund's Hut. Now Lund and his wife (who is buried outside) couldn't have put them there, but the objects themselves are clues to who did. Now think, what does a dragonfly do when you try to catch it? It flies away - it flees. Who do we know that's fleeing from Rorikstead and Skyrim? Lokir. \n\nHave you read Kolb and the Dragon? What's it about? It's one of those old style make your own adventure books where you are given multiple choices to different conclusions. In Kolb and the Dragon nearly all those choices end with the adventurer dying. Who makes a series of unfortunate choices that leads to their death? Lokir.\n\nNow for a long time during this investigation I thought Lund and Lokir were gay lovers, but I didn't consider the most obvious clue of all the wives in Rorikstead being dead. There's a cairn outside with a ring on it so that's Lund's wife and Lokir is their son. On the cart Lokir says, \"Empire was nice and lazy until you Stormcloaks came along.\" Now what is associated with laziness in the Elder Scrolls? Skeever dens. What do we find at Lund's Hut? Skeevers, further evidence tying Lokir to Lund's Hut. We have a dead family so Lokir inherits the family heirloom - the dragon scales from the dragon war.\n\nSo what's happened? Lokir comes home and finds his father dead. He takes a blue dartwing from the cobwebs,  his favourite children's book and his family heirloom. He places them at the Shrine of Akatosh and flees Skyrim. He flees, he dies, the dragon Alduin returns - that's the significance of the offerings at the Shrine of Akatosh. \n\nWhen you complete the main quest and read the Elder Scroll you will hear Felldir the Old when banishing Alduin say, \"...From all our endings unto the last.\" It is Lokir's \"ending\" that happens just before you hear Alduin.",
