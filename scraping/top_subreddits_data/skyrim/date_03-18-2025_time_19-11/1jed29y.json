I was just a kid following the main quest) was amazing, something like, \"Hey, I have a partner now?\"\n\nThen something ignited in me, and I've been completely loyal to Lydia ever since, in every single gameplay. (Yes i'm autistic)\n\nBut I'm finally in the mood for something different, I want to get to know other followers. Who's your favorite? And why?\n\n",
