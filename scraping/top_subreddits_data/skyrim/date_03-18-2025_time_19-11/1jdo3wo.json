When you loot one of these things (like ore), it automatically goes into virtual storage so it doesn't weigh you down.  When you interact with a crafting station or merchant all items in virtual storage are added to your character and carry weight temporarily adjusted by like 10,000.  When you leave the merchant or crafting station, the temp carry weight is removed and all components go back into virtual storage.  \n\nIt also comes with a 'Bag of Holding' feature which gives another 200 lb of virtual storage to manually add things to... Like maybe an extra weapon or armor set that you want to carry around but not have take up inventory space.  It has a teleport spell with mark and recall along with a bunch of preconfigured locations.  And finally it has a spectra horse you can call... But I haven't used that so I can't speak to it.  \n\nAll of this is configurable with the MCM.  You can also add items to its automatic storage in the case of mod added components that aren't natively recognized or remove something from auto storage (like if you need it in your inventory for a quest).",

But at the same time Skyrim is a game and everyone is welcome (and should be encouraged) to play it however they like.  If one wants a hardcore experience with no quality of life elements like virtual storage or teleportation, then there are mods to achieve that.  If one wants a more casual experience, focused more on story than mechanics, then there are mods to achieve that experience... And every experience inbetween (a bunch more not on this spectrum).

Frankly, it's sometimes more fun if you can carry more.\n\nPersonally, I would LOVE if games started admitting that it isn't realistic and came up with an in universe way that explains how much people carry. And seriously, backpacks isn't enough. Those couldn't hold a single full suit of steel plate armour.\n\n**Null Space: Pandimensional storage based on your will**\n\nThe idea is that in this alternate world, people can naturally store things in null spaces formed by their will. Where is your inventory? Null space. How can that rodent have been carrying a full suit of plate armour? Animals have a rudimentary ability to store in null space too.\n\nThis isn't anything special in these alternate worlds, it's just something that comes naturally. It's as natural as the telekinetic ability to have your weapon hover just behind your back. Anyone can do it.\n\nYou can hold more in your null space based on your (whatever works to balance things). There are even items that can help you focus more and thus have more in your null space. Some of them aren't as ugly as backpacks!\n\nPlease note that this really isn't anything that games haven't been doing for years. It's just giving a justification for it that isn't too crazy.\n\nBonus: I would love that if someone died, the items from their null space appeared in this world in a glowing sphere of ectoplasm that dissipated when touched. It would be easier to find loot from corpses.",

It's Nirn. \n\nIf you like the aesthetic of adventurers wearing backpacks, I recommend Outward. Hope it's okay to suggest other games.",
