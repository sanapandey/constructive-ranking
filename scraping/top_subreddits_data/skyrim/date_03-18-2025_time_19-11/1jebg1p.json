Turn around and sell those potions to the person at the desk, buy all their ingredients, turn them into potions, then sell those. It's way more efficient than gathering clothes, weapons, armour, etc. Each ingredient weighs like .1 and some mixes can earn you hundreds, even thousands of coins. Going into dungeons and looting weapons and armour can encumber you pretty quickly and they don't earn you as much money. Unless it's really early in the game, I don't even pick up weapons and armour anymore. Having to stop to travel back to the city to sell your entire inventory every 10 minutes is just a waste of time",

Transmute spell allows you to transmute iron ore into silver ore, and silver ore into gold ore, respectively. You can then smelt the gold ore and make it into jewelry at any forge and then sell for a ton of gold. This loop levels Alteration, Speech, and Blacksmithing skill trees while generating a ton of gold for you.\n\nLonger path to making gold is to 100% the Thieves Guild quest line. Becoming the leader of the Thieves Guild significantly increases the chances of rare gemstones appearing in chests and on corpses. Also, the repeatable quests (Shill Job, Burglary Job, etc.) you can pick up from Vex and Delvin Mallory in The Ragged Flagon to restore the Thieves Guild will reward a decent amount of gold upon each completion.",

This is the case for any loadable instance in the game, I also read somewhere that it resets after 10 days provided you leave one ore deposit unharvested, but I can\u2019t confirm this.\n\nThe faster solution to farming iron ore though is to simply check the blacksmith every day for whatever town you\u2019re in, and buy all the iron ore from them",

You'll buy her iron ore, save, attack her until she becomes hostile, then reload. You can buy as much ore as you want this way, so keep going until you are broke broke. Then, turn the iron into gold, which you smelt and turn into rings. You can sell these to mage merchants and general merchants, saving and punching them each time they run out of gold so you can reload and reset their gold. The Halted Stream part will probably take 45 minutes, and you could probably make the 8000 you need in... say, 2 hours after that? You'll make one ring per Iron Ore you purchase. It will cost you roughly 8-4 gold per piece of ore, and you'll make on average, 35 gold, so you'll net out at roughly 31 gold per ore you buy, and multiply however much gold you start with by a factor of six. However, there are two or three mines that you should already have easy access to, and they are really easy to clear as well. You will have already cleared the camp, and you probably took care of Embershard Mine already too, so you just need to head up to Dawnstar and go through the mines up there. You'll find 100 ore doing that pretty much for free, which will roughly translate into about 3000 gold right there, as an example. The better you get at Alteration, the faster this will ultimately be, too.",

            "body": "Short answer - sell jewelry, preferably enchanted. Long answer - go to halted stream camp to get transmute and a bunch of iron ore from there and merchants, you can go to more mines if you want for extra iron or silver ore and gems. In Whiterun there are four merchants who can sell you iron ore; adrianne, war-bear, belethor, and eorlund. Transmute all your iron ore into gold ore, make jewelry with your gold and gems. Now ideally you have a bunch of filled soul gems, size isnt important as long as you have a lot. The easiest way to do this is to first buy a shit ton of empty petty and lesser soul gems. Then get any bound weapon spell you like (my favorite is the bow) and the soul stealer conjuration perk. Now go kill a bunch of wolves or spiders or whatever easy enemy you want that isnt human. You can only fill black soul gems with human souls which are too expensive. Now take all that jewelry you made and enchant it with whatever enchantment gives it the highest value for the smallest soul. Some enchantments are much more valuable than others, given the level of soul you use. Give your most valuable jewelry the highest level souls and enchantments. Now finally sell the enchanted jewelry! If you want money sooner then sell the unenchanted jewelry too, if you want more money overall, dont sell anything that isn\u02bbt enchanted, more enchanted jewelry is more money and more exp. And you will get a lot of exp in numerous stats and regularly bankrupt merchants like this. I usually use the lover standing stone to increase the exp. The best place to buy a bunch of soul gems and sell all your enchanted jewerly to is at the college of winterhold. Every professor sells soul gems! I do this with pretty much every character I make and it makes them stronger much faster",

With the banish daedra enchantment, it makes every dagger worth 500+ gold. I often do Gauls of like 30 enchanted daggers after some questing and come out with thousands. Also enchant and sell all your jewelry. Also potions. Just collect every single ingredient you come across, craft everything into potions and then sell all your potions. It goes a really long way. Have hardly had less than 30000 gold this entire playthrough",

Go to Tel Mythrin and buy all of Master Neloth and his apprentice's soul gyms\n7. To start I'd recommend making Iron Daggers with banish daedra on them and sell them.\n8. You can invest in alchemy to make potions of speechcraft.\n9. After making enough money, you can swap to making enchanted golden rings.

            "body": "I use passive leveling systems to gain gold while playing the game. Takes extra effort between missions to keep things rolling, but is very efficient time-wise.\n\nBasically find multiple incomes, and work at them. I like Smithing and Enchanting, personally, but you can do whatever is fun for you.\n\nGo on a quest and pick up as much valuable stuff as you can. ALways fill your inventory as much as possible. Even if it's just armor and weapons to sell. Keep and eye on \"gold value per pound\" and try to pick stuff that's lighter with more value to carry the most money.\n\nWhen you return to town, sell everything, and purchase materials for your leveling skills. In my case, I get the Alteration Spell: Transmute very early in the game and buy/mine as much iron ore as I can find, and convert it to gold ore, to be made into jewelry. Jewelry requires no smiting skill or level to be made, generates a lot of experience per item crafted, and has a high resale value and low carry weight. So it's easy to stock up on lots of it, and even if all the vendors run out of money, carrying 30 gold necklaces is 10lbs... It's basically not even noticed.\n\nMaking 2 gold rings gives you a potential sale value of 75 each, for 150 gold total, and costs 1 gold bar (2 gold ore), which is 7 gold each for 2 iron ore that you buy, or free if you mine them. So your minimum profit, even at a low level is 136 gold per set of rings crafted.\n\nFrom there, I enchant them. Youll need soul gems, so it helps to collect or buy them, as well as destroying enchanted items to gain more valuable enchants to sell (skill enchants are usually more valuable: Smithing, Archery, One-Handed, etc.). Jewelry (or even junk) with enchantments sells for much greater value. Even spending 90 gold on a filled petty soul gem can add several hundred in value with the right enchant in the mid levels of the game.\n\nObviously you can branch out more if you aren't scared of level-spiking (your overall character level effects enemy strength. So if you level a lot of \"non-combat skills\" you can find yourself having a hard time keeping up with enemy strength). I often get Soul Trap, even if I'm not a mage character because it helps level conjuration so you can earn more skill points to spend, and also makes it much easier to have filled soul gems on hand to use for Enchanting; while also keeping you from spending a ton of money on filled soul gems.\n\nBy level 20 I had like 40k gold and 2 houses this run \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23. Wasn't even trying to save up. Becomes a natural process quickly. There are several similar patterns, such as alchemy which gives you lots of potions to sell or use, which can also be used to make your smithing and Enchanting more powerful. You'll often hear people refer to these three skills and their relationship as \"The Restoration Loop\" or \"The Loop\", but it's really the basis of doing anything \"broken\" in this game, such as becoming extremely strong or earning a ton of money in a short time.\n\nThese bonuses are additive and multiplicative. So if you use a Potion to make Enchanting stronger, then use it to enchant something to make alchemy stronger, to make a potion to make Enchanting stronger... rinse, repeat. Can use the same 2 skills to make smithing improvement better and get insane armor numbers. Some skills have a built-in cap to how strong they can get, but the cap is so high it doesn't really matter. You'll be swatting end-game enemies like flies.\n\nI like to breakdown the \"gloves of the pugilist\" for the Unarmed Damage Perk, paired with the heavy armor skill for the same, and using The Loop to gain crazy punch damage. Nothing better than slapping an Elder Dragon to death in 3 hits \ud83e\udd23.",
