            "body": "Awesome!!! I have one achievement remaining and it's Dragonrider: Tame and ride five dragons. I just googled whether it was possible and Glitchmeister Jarl Sweet Joel has made a couple of videos on it.\n\nIt requires you to fast travel away from the area where you killed the dragon in that split second between the dragon having zero health and the beginning of the soul absorption animation. You then sleep for ten days and return to the dragon lair. When the respawned dragon lands in the spot where the previous one died, the absorb dragon soul animation will play out but the skeleton will still be alive. This will allow you to use the Bend Will shout on it and mount it. Here are the tutorials from Jarl Sweet Joel:\n\nHow to make your own skeletal dragon https://youtu.be/iv0NjmB9CM8?si=HvfbnVKb4u7KOHQj\n\nHow to ride a skeleton dragon https://youtu.be/Ihy1GTA9O4k?si=3QVM0Kcp1Ovdf8l3\n\nI'll find out if this glitch disables the achievement. I'm getting my last achievement on this playthrough after getting my first on 10/11/11 (my copy arrived a day early). Thanks for posting this OP.",
