    "selftext": "The sword is 120 cm (47 inches) long and made from polyurethane resin. I cast it in a two-part silicone mold ans it weighs about 1,2 kg (2.6 pounds). The surface is painted with Vallejo acrylics, using a sponge technique and drybrushing to get that aged metal look. The grip is wrapped with jute rope, just like in the game.\n\nIt took me several tries to get the casting right, and the whole process including molding, sanding, and painting took several weeks. I also added some reference tools in the pictures for scale.",
