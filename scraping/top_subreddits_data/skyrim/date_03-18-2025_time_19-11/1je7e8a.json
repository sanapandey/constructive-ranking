If they're not revived and newly spawned references are used instead, it will clutter your savegame. The amount of references you can have on a savegame is limited too.\n\nIf you don't want to clutter your savegame, then use the old references. Those references have to be stored somewhere (hence, Dead Body Cleanup Cell). If you think you know better and delete those references anyway, then the next time the game tries to access that reference it will simply break a quest/character or outright softlock you with a guaranteed CTD.\n\nThe thing about \"a creature killing NPCs\" in that room is false. Dead NPCs stay dead unless you tell the engine to resurrect them.\n\nThe engine does allow you to permanently delete a reference from the savegame (MarkForDelete command), but this command shouldn't be used at all, unless you spawn something yourself.",

While her Thane, a khajit, is right there! \n\nAnyway I dismissed her and made Erandur my Khajit's follower instead. He's not been racist a single time, and he calls my khajit his daughter, so she lost a racist and gained an adoptive dad. (She doesn't quite understand that's what priests do for everyone). \n\nMy current Argonian (also imperial) with Cicero however is planning to kill Lydia for Boethia, Lydia pissed her off by calling the guards, on her Thane, while we were trying to do the Dark Brotherhood quests. \"Not supposed to be here\" ma'am you're ALSO not supposed to call the guards on me as my follower but look where we are now. \n\nAnd after this I don't think I'm risking Lydia again she manages to keep making different characters upset.",

Her default equipment provides a total armor rating of 169. She does not wear a helmet by default, but can equip any if given one. She can also wear any ring or necklace given to her by the Dragonborn, which can be useful due to the added effects these items may have. She can equip armor given to her, if its armor rating surpasses that of her default equipment. She can and will wear light armor, but her high Heavy Armor skill makes it difficult without a high Smithing skill or high-end armor, or the \"equipitem\" console command.\n\nIt should be noted that, similar to other followers, there are multiple options to change her gear. She may be dismissed then pickpocketed to remove her default gear using the Perfect Touch Pickpocket perk. Alternatively, she may be married so that she opens a shop \u2014 this then allows the Dragonborn to buy her default clothes, which forces her to wear alternative gear.\nWeapons\n\nShe only uses a shield if the best melee weapon in her inventory is One-Handed, otherwise she uses a Two-Handed weapon. Lydia's default weapon is a steel sword. If her sword is removed or if opponents are out of melee range, she uses a hunting bow, with an infinite supply of iron arrows, though these arrows cannot be taken from her inventory. Similar to her melee weapon and armor, she can be given stronger arrows and a stronger bow, which she will use instead. \"",

Didn't get another companion because Lydia \"died so easily\" and thought it applied to the rest.\n\n100 hours later I'm busy achievement hunting and do the romance and marriage. We are there at the alter and literally everyone gets up and is saying how disgusted they are at me. I'm like what? What's going on?!\n\nIt's Lydia.\n\nSpecifically her corpse.\n\nIts teleported from the dungeon to the wedding. And there it is right in the middle of the aisle.\n\nI speak to the potential spouse and she agrees to the wedding again. Jump forward 30 seconds, and we're back where we are started. Did this 2-3 more times.\n\nThe solution? Drag her corpse over to the hatch that leads under the temple seating. Drag her corpse right under the altar. Attempt the wedding again, all goes smoothly,  we say our vows over Lydia's corpse because she *is* technically in the wedding but no one is shocked by her corpse.\n\nGet the achievement.",

Put your crosshair over Lydia, open the console, type \"recycleactor\" (without the quotes) and she'll pop back to life. (If this doesn't work, try typing \"Prid 000A2C94\" and then recycleactor again. Prid will force-select Lydia. Normally you can just have your crosshairs over them and it'll select them, but it sometimes doesn't work for dead characters.)\n\nHowever, I'd say, don't resurrect her. Use this as an RP opportunity. Maybe you forgo followers completely out of guilt, maybe you go on a killing spree to avenge her death. Lots of possibilities.",

I could have reloaded the save but again this was my first playthrough and it didn't feel right.  I was fully immersed in the world and the characters.  Instead I took her armor and weapons and used the flames spell to rp cremate her.  I put the armor on a mannequin in my house and the sword on a wall mount weapon display as a memorial to her.

I recalled the confidence we had going in that we could handle anything\u2026 I eventually made it back to Whiterun, and my suspicions were correct\u2026 she was not there. I had searched the Ruins extensively before leaving. I never saw her body, it must have been burnt up by the flames. I had never felt such emotion from any game before.

            "body": "A dragon attacked markarth and my boy Cosnach died. Outside my house I had local flowers, a chunk of silver ore, his helmet, and various types of ale placed in a sort of shrine kinda way.\n\nI didn't even know he died as he was dismissed at the time because I was doing sneaky stuff to the falmer until when I got the inheritance slip from a courier. Went to the halls of the dead and there in a stone coffer was all of his armor and weapons. I left him with his weapon and armor and gave him back his 100 septims. Took his dwarven helm because it'll just get in the way of his Ale Mug in Sovngarde\n\nI hope he hustles those who didn't believe in him with that 100 bucks to show he was worthy of being The DragonBorn's friend and battle companion, and perished after defending his homeland from an ancient dragon, because if he wasn't worthy when we traded fists, he sure as hell is overqualified now",
