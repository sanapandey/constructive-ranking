Then I spent like an hour excitedly playing around with the blacksmith stuff. I remember getting the wolf pelts and crafting some armor, then trying to find more wolves. I found the whole system so cool. And then I remember getting jumped by a dual wielding Dark Brotherhood assassin and I was like \"YOU CAN DUAL WIELD??\"\n\nGood times... So what about you guys? Any good memories from your first few hours playing?",

Man, this game had me questioning my love for AC2 which was my favourite game at the time (still love it), and now Skyrim is one of the greatest games I've ever played.

I grabbed a copy for the PlayStation 3, as was the style at the time. And I brought it home. The game looked lovely but played like crap. Terrible game. Glitching everywhere, crashing, bugging out. Dragons flying backwards. Cats and dogs, living together. Total anarchy. Couldn\u2019t figure out why they all loved it. Then I realized I was the ONLY one playing it on ps3, as was the style at the time. So I returned the game to Redbox and got it for the 360, which is what we used to call an Xbox back then. I got it home and it was a complete 180, which is half of a 360. Give me 2 180s for a 360 you\u2019d say. The game looked a bit worse, but played great. So much fun. When it was time to return that game, I ended up buying it on steam and got the best of both worlds. Game looked its best and played its best.",

He told me I had to try the game out, that it was one of the best games ever made. So i spent a few minutes building a Nord character and then got right into the game. Followed Hadvar into Riverwood, then headed to Fort Greymoor and began killing bandits. By the time the fort was cleared out, I already knew I was gonna buy the game as soon as I got home. Haven't gone more than a few months without playing it since then. I still enjoy going to Fort Greymoor early on to level up a bit. But I usually kill at least one dragon first, so I have a shout when I get there.",
