It's wild. They're just perpetuating the idea that 38 is 58 in pop star years, and it's odd to do that to her of all people because her thing has always been more avant garde rather than \"look how young & hot I am\" even in her early 20s.",

Young people think anyone over 30 is ancient. \n\nWriting pop music as a creative person over 30 is tough, because it's so...generic. You're basically making the same songs over and over. Literally for some modern pop, where the label just tells you to interlopate an old classic pop song. \n\nLady Gaga has always been a trailblazer in that regard, making pop that had some creative chops.
