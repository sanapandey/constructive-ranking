On the other hand, political posts are some of the most popular posts on our subreddit (judging by upvotes and general engagment). So, we listened and decided on a compromise : Politics are no longer allowed as **posts** unless they are *directly linked to pop culture*.\n\nFor example :\n\n>Carrie Underwood sings at the inauguration \u2705\n\n>Zelensky and Trump at the White House \u274c\n\nUltimately it will be at our discretion but as always, we are actively listening to the community and remain open to changes in the future.\n\nBut to be clear, **there is no ban on political discussions.** In fact, we are implementing **a weekly discussion thread where you can openly discuss politics whether it be pop culture related or not.** It will be automatically published **every Saturday at 10 am EST** and pinned to the front page of the subreddit.",

So many subs on this platform are incredibly misogynistic, and this is on all platforms.\n\nThis sub isn\u2019t perfect and there\u2019s glimpses of misogyny time to time, but it definitely feels like the one corner of the internet where us women can just talk and gossip and this sub has a much more positive vibe compared to the other infamous one.\n\nMod team is doing a great job! Keep doing what your doing, you deserve your 10s\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

As someone with OCD and anxiety, I have had too many sleepless nights the last few months because I can't stop worrying and obsessing over our country and my children's future. \n\nI take in political content when I am able and from reputable news sources. I stay informed to a level that is good for my mental health. When everything is made political, it's almost more important to have spaces that aren't political so we can take a breath and be ready to engage in politics again.\n\nThis sub is a fantastic distraction and gives me the same feeling as when I watch a comfort TV show. This is a type of self care, so please don't dismiss it or act like it's not important.",
