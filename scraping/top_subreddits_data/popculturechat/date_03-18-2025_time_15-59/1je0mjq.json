To me it's also similar to the 'model off duty' look of the 2000s. Both are rooted in the idea that your beauty (again, the one specific kind of beauty being celebrated) speaks for itself and your clothes and makeup are secondary. \n\nboth ideas are complete bullshit, of course, but the clean girl one sucks especially to me because it feels like people are forgoing personal style for looking bland and marketable. To model is to be a blank slate for someone elses ideas, and with the clean girl look, it's  like they're staying clean so they can go viral, get that #sponsor, and push someone else's ideas.
