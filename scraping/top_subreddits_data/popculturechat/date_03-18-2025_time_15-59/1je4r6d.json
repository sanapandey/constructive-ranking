She has said for decades that performing is a byproduct of her love of writing. As a fan who has been around since the \u201colden days\u201d I can absolutely say with certainty that fans of Taylor today are a completely diffrent breed. Calling them a Cult doesn\u2019t really encompass their rabid behavior. TLDR: I miss when the fans were not absolutely feral and rabid (and mean).",

I'm actually angry that the new Gaga album has a TS-esque song on it, it's so immature and not at all what I've come to expect from Gaga. Oo, a song about a dude who wants to cheat with a grown ass woman in her 30s, so deep, so powerful \ud83d\ude44. The rest of the album is awesome, so like... Why?!",

It isnt that i think MC is better than JHud or Cynthis (I def do not), its just the way they sing....i just cant imagine JHud singing this song because it would be so out there in terms of her personal style of singing. Ariana is fine. I think maybe she could probably do it just because shes closer to that stylization but idk if id like it. Where as I think ariana did not do Aretha justice when she sang at that event. Those vocals wouldve been better suited to someone like JHud",
