So they can have a ton of different color variations or versions they want as longs as the consumer is sticking with 4 per transaction. It\u2019s the reason why some artists announce and pre-order 1 variation at a time so people can buy 4 of the same variation and then the next week buy the next then after a full week they\u2019ll make the full set available all at once.

I've seen a lot of people connect this to T.swift but while she did sell digital variants those were never her best seller formats or even close to that (probably because those bonus tracks were uploaded by fans minutes later, so what would be the point of buying), Billboard even noted how without the digital sales her chart position would remain the same\n\nHer latest album sold way way more in physicals (and streaming) than anyone else, not in digital. Other artists like Travis Scott who rely a lot on digital variants in their sales may be more affected.\n\n2. While I understand the reasoning for this, environmentally its a bad move, artists are now more incentivized to create those variants on CDs, creating significantly more waste",

Again, depends how you look at it. If I listen to Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Sour on streaming 100 times, or buy the vinyl and listen to it 100 times, there is likely a difference in energy use between those two actions, but I think each listener has to decide for themselves.\n\nSome vinyl printing companies are more ethical than others, I always encourage anyone to look at which company has printed the vinyls (especially as some have better quality than others)",

She's always had a deep interest with charts, records, and statistics, far more than most other artists. This is exactly why people single her out. Both she and her fans are intensely focused on achieving massive numbers and securing the #1 spot in everything.",

Taylor did however release 36 different versions of TTPD. 19 physical if you include CDs and cassettes. That means there were 17 different digital versions, like the digital versions with exclusive tracks, and then the digital versions with exclusive voice notes, then some more exclusive versions with live performances from her tour. I think they\u2019re trying to crack down on things like this. But according to the comments on here it won\u2019t affect her anyway because Taylor sells mostly physical so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

With this restriction in place, charts will be a slightly more fair playing field that really showcases which albums and songs are truly popular in the US.\n\nHowever, I'm also noticing the physical sales restrictions are not the same and I really hope this doesn't result in more physical variants + waste. It should just be limited to 4 variants of physical, 4 variants of digital. \n\nUgh, and now I'm thinking about how this might result in more autopen signatures if they create more limits. Maybe I'll stop buying signed copies of vinyl/CD, I'm not trying to pay for autopen.",
