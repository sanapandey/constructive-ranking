This is just a way to target black service members for infractions and kick them out. Which is wild because they are always struggling to get people to join! As a white girl, my time in the military was really eye opening. I definitely saw my black friends targeted for minor infractions by leadership that a white service member would never be bothered about. People in power were real eager to crack down on any brown person with a hair out of place!\n\nAnd I served while Obama was in office! I listened to his inauguration on a bus ride in basic training. I can't imagine serving now during the Trump times. Seeing them erase the Code talkers and Tuskegee Airmen is chilling and heartbreaking.",

They're saying it's because the marines with razor bumps fail to meet the grooming standard.\n\nYou used to be able to get a shaving waiver if you had PFB.  Now, no more waivers.   So you either see a dermatologist and hope for a miracle, or you could get booted.",
