But I personally welcome a warped definition of leftism.\n\nBecause I don't think these things are mutually exclusive. Nor do I think Bill's values are as rigid as you say. A pure and refined left is a left that loses valuable common spaces, and I know many working class people would sympathise with Bill Burr's rhetoric. I believe in heterogeneity, so despite some unsavoury stuff we might not agree with, I'd rather his old school progressivism is on the airwaves than another unfunny anti-woke comedian.",

Or is the only response to just blow it up without considering other options that could avoid that outcome? \n\nThe other thing that really bothers me about it is that Israel always just says that the enemy was hiding in these populated areas/buildings without providing proof. Or maybe they are providing proof and news outlets aren't privy to that info? Either way it seems like Israel is bombing everything, killing large numbers of civilians, and claiming the enemy was hiding there but we don't know if that's true.
