You put a little boy and a little girl on an island no outside influence and he\u2019ll probably figure out he\u2019s bigger and stronger eventually. \n\nNo, I\u2019m not saying men are inherently evil. I\u2019m saying they\u2019re entitled. I\u2019m saying they have to choose, or be trained, not to put their desires first. You say the entitlement comes from patriarchy, but where does patriarchy come from? Biological differences. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know how to change it because male supremacy (not patriarchy, this is another vague academic unhelpful term, yes I know what it is so you don\u2019t need to explain again, I just disagree with you) is woven into the fabric of human civilization. Sexism is the OG prejudice and discrimination. I don\u2019t know what human civilization looks like without men claiming supremacy.\n\nEdit: I have lived in many countries and not just America so i\u2019m speaking from developing counties, other cultures, etc. Your interpretation is unfortunately a first world academic one.",

                            "body": "I can! So in India, Dalits (formerly known as Untouchables) and also called Scheduled Castes are those who are at the very bottom of the caste system (really, they are so low that they are sort of outside of the caste system). Their marginalization goes back pretty far in time. They often live in slums extremely far below the poverty line. They also tend to be in pretty remote areas so they have difficulty accessing resources and infrastructure. \n\nThe structural violence they face is extreme. The police and government overwhelmingly fail to provide help to them. They get turned away or harrassed when they try to make police reports. They are seen as and treated pretty sub-human so it tends not to be considered a big deal when crimes are committed against them.  \n\nThe man who did this had a history of going around to different Dalit slums and terrorizing them (and he wasn't just a serial rapist but a murderer who also exploited them for the little resources they had). The police really did absolutely nothing. He was finally being arraigned when they killed him at the courthouse (they had attempted and failed to kill him in prior years). I believe they did so because he had been arrested and released in the past so I don't believe they thought he'd actually stay in prison. I also believe it was a message to the officials. That this is what happens when they don't do their job. They planned it very well so that no one person could be charged. The women spearheaded the mobilization and planning (one particular woman named Usha really catalyzed it). Although it was reported as only the women killing him, men of the community were also involved, but they covered that because they knew benevolent sexism would be on their side (they were correct).\n\nIt was weirdly a beautiful example of community and solidarity, but it only happened because of how marginalized they are.\n\nEdit: I'd like to clarify that India legally abolished any discrimination by caste in 1950, but that really hasn't done much to curtail the mistreatment of lower caste individuals, nor has it actually gotten rid of the caste system.",
