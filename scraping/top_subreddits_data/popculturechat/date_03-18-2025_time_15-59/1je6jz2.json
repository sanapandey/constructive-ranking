Many nations have a similar system where you can essentially pay for citizenship.",

But let\u2019s be real, these celebrities are still probably going to spend plenty of time (and lots of money) in the US. They will fly back and forth to visit friends and family, and to also attend all the fun, exclusive events that celebrities go to like galas, award shows, concerts, parties, etc. Plus, for many of them, they\u2019ll still need to come back here for work. They will spend their wealth of money here, even if they don\u2019t live here anymore. I guess that\u2019s what sort of bothers me when I read these stories about celebrities \u201cfleeing\u201d the US because of Trump and the direction this country is heading. They will still come and go as they please, and they will be just fine at the end of the day. For other people who flee their country due to politics and fear for their safety, huge sacrifices in their lives are made, and they often can\u2019t even return to their home country even if they want to, out of safety or just because they don\u2019t have the means to. \n\nAgain, Courtney Love and other celebs/rich people can do whatever they want with their money; it\u2019s their life, and I don\u2019t really expect anything out of them. But it just sorta feels out of touch and self-congratulatory when they talk about it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a terrible person or anything like that, it just rubs me the wrong way is all.",
