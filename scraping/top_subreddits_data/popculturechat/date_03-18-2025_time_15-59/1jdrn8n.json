Taylor tapped into that element in making every show unique and special with the surprise songs. Sabrina tapped into the element first with the Nonsense outro\u2019s & next with the Juno move lol. People posted it because it makes them feel special having something unique at their show & it made other people want to go to the show and have that. I deleted socials halfway through Eras so I never got to see GUTS but even on just Reddit I have seen WAY more talk on Sabrina\u2019s tour than Olivia\u2019s. I\u2019m a fan of both\u2019s music but I honestly did not care for the GUTS tour (watched it on Netflix) and I\u2019ve only seen clips of Sabrina\u2019s but I think it\u2019s pretty damn good.",

In a lot of ways, Sabrina\u2019s been very lucky with her trajectory. Of course it\u2019s hard to be just shy of breaking into the mainstream for so many years, but because of that, she got to grow up outside of the mainstream spotlight and then enter the main pop world as fun pin-up aesthetic Sabrina Carpenter, who, fun fact, was on Disney Channel. \n\nInstead of Miley who was fully in the mainstream as family-friendly Hannah Montana and had to make her transition to more adult music completely in the public eye.",

Everyone knows Bodak Yellow. Meg has a whole list of hits, a collab with Beyonc\u00e9, multiple viral songs, and she\u2019s performed at every music award show. In contrast, 1 Espresso does not a legacy make.\n\nNot that how mainstream an artist is has anything to do with how womens\u2019 sexuality is policed \u2014 they WILL be policed regardless, whether they\u2019re black or white, the tone of how their sexuality is policed is the only thing that changes.",
