We quit Twitter in 2022 when he was only half a Nazi,\u201d says singer Ken Casey. \u201cThen someone else took our handle, pretending to be our official account, so we filed a legal complaint to put a stop to that\u2014which is why @dropkickmurphys shows as suspended. Look, we pulled our account because we didn\u2019t want to be part of that guy\u2019s empire. But if we were still on there, I\u2019m sure he would have suspended us by now.\u201d*",
