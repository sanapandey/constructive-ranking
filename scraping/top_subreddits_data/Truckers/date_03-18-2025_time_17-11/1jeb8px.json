I was able to get back to that shipper about a week later and they had the wallet but in the meantime if I'd been pulled over I'd have had a copy any reasonable cop would have accepted.\n\nThis is why chain wallets are called trucker wallets. I bought a good one from a quality leatherworker and have kept all my shit straight since. Don't get a chain wallet from Amazon. Get a good one and rest easy.\n\nhttps://www.mrlentz.com/wallets/",
