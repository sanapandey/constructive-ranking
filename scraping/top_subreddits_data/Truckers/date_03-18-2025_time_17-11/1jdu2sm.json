Or if you\u2019re in a situation where a wheel is off the ground somehow, like an odd-angle ramp. If I\u2019m not mistaken, your front right wheel is the one that will tend to spin first, all things equal.\n\nDo not engage if a wheel is actively spinning, try to avoid use on hard pavement, and use at low speeds. Can be engaged while moving straight in most cases.",

I\u2019ve heard many different opinions and it really can make a difference breaking stuff or not.  Or more wear and tear. \nIf you don\u2019t want to. Personally I drive my truck with the interlock/power divider in as soon as I leave pavement, or if I start climbing some slow speed sketchy side roads.  We\u2019ve got some hillside single lane almost vertical pavement around here that you can loose traction on quick that\u2019ll lead to a bad day. Really depends on the suspension and wheel base how badly or how quickly. \n\nPersonally diff lock never gets used unless Im stuck. And not stuck stuck, but like \u201cif those other two tires spin I can definitely walk out of this stuck\u201d. If I have to use diff lock to get to where I can dump then someone needs to fix something. Way too much wear and tear on a truck if thats the case. Your mileage may vary on that though.  Some construction companies run their shit hard and don\u2019t care what you do to get the job done.  Also, they go through rear ends and driveshafts like it\u2019s going out of style.  You start running both to get into a jobsite and you\u2019ll be shocked and just how far and buried you can get in a short amount of time.",

I only use that myself when swapping trailers specifically on ice and snow or possibly mud when I won't be turning the wheel and it's only on until I can roll the trailer forward from where it was dropped a bit.

You can still spin both lefts or both rights or one left plus one right. \n\nThrowing the right switch means L1 speed equals R1 and L2 speed equals R2 \\*. You can still spin one (whole) axle while the other one sits there and laughs at you.\n\nThrowing both switches means L1 = L2 = R1 =R2 speeds\\*. Three of your tires could be sitting on ice and the last one (with grip) will drive you out of trouble, albeit with a lot of stress on those locked differentials. The real stress comes if all of your tires are on mixed ice and spin, then one of them finds grip; the sudden torque spike can mean instant frown and a very slippery situation for the greenbacks in your wallet (or your company's wallet). \n\n\n\n\\* We're assuming in this case that both axles have differential locks. If only one axle has a differential lock, then the result is a little different here. The right switch would mean that L1 = R1 OR L2 = R2, and both switches would mean something like L1 = R1 = average(L2+R2).",
