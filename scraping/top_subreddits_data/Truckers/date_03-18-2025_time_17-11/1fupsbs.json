How do I x, y or z?\u201d at least tell us where you are or where you want to be. Wouldn\u2019t hurt to throw in what experience you DO have no matter how little. I could suggest dozens and dozens of companies or options to someone living in the western 11, especially Cali, Az, Utah and Nevada but I don\u2019t know shit about the east coast. A lot of guys here do. I think your chances of getting the information you\u2019re looking for would increase greatly. I\u2019m not taking the time to drag that info out of you myself and most people won\u2019t. If you\u2019re wanting genuine help from people who have good information and advice to offer then do your part and come prepared. ",

The only difference between rookies making 100K and experienced drivers making 100K is that the rookies are usually working harder for that money. Dot Foods and Central transport, for example, are all too happy to pay guys $100,000 a year. But both of them are going to have you breaking down pallets.\n\nEven Cintas route drivers can make 100K a year, and they don't even need a cdl. Or at least not a class A. And they don't even work 5 days a week.",

Check out some rolling CB interviews on YouTube, though you\u2019re probably not gonna find anyone talking about a black dog lol. YouTube is just gonna be your best resource all around. You can find guys loading and unloading cattle, guys using scales, going through ports of entry, fueling, washing, dealing with brokers/dispatchers etc etc. Give all that a try first because scoring a job in this industry and more specifically the cattle hauling side of things just so you can write a book is gonna be a tall order.",
