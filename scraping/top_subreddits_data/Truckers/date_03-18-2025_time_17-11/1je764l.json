I told him I wasn\u2019t parked, that I was in line for fuel.  He said there is no line that I\u2019m in.  I pointed to the truck in front of me and the truck in front of that one (at the fuel pump\u2026driver probably went inside for McDs or whatever, since it had been a good 15 minutes) and told him this is the fucking line for this pump.  He threatened to call a tow truck if I didn\u2019t move.  \n\nWent inside and told the manager, and manager told them to chill the fuck out.\n\nPerhaps get the fuckers that are hogging the fuel lanes in busy times (every lane was backed up 2-3 deep, no one had pulled forward to the line at all, and it was the busy time, like 5pm), not the ones waiting in line behind them.",
