It assumes interstates and larger state/U.S. highways as backups so it's closer to actual miles, without being overly generous or overly restrictive.\n\nI've also been paid hourly and for local work hourly is great usually. I don't like it though because it almost begs me to take advantage of it and run an 8 hour run in 10 hours just because. I value my time at home over worrying about making sure I get my full 8/10/12 whatever.\n\nI've never been paid zip to zip and wouldn't take a job that paid that way unless the mileage rate was enough to make up for it shorting you.",
