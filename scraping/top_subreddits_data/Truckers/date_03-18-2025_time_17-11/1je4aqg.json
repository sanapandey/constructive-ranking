The FMCSA has determined that the periodic inspection programs required by all of the Canadian Provinces and Mexico\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) defined in the Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM, or Official Mexican Standard) NOM-068-SCT-2-2014 are comparable to, or as effective as, the periodic inspection requirements contained in the FMCSRs - Appendix G.\n\n\nI think that may be your answer",
