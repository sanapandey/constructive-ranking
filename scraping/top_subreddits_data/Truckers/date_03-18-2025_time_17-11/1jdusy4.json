He saw the bumper last second, slammed on his brakes, veered right. This was my first ever long run at my first ever company and i still stand by saying all i could do was hit the brakes. Going slow enough, disabled vehicles on the shoulder, people slowing down properly for a bumper in the left, and this jackass in front of me. Load shifted, got it to receiver and they refused it because everything stacked forward. My company kept me in Denver for four days trying to find a warehouse where it could be restacked. Told me not to run the reefer when I questioned juice in the summer heat. Restacked it with some hard working gentlemen who were happy i spoke Spanish. Went back to receiver and got it refused for mold. Drove all the way back to PA. Shipper said in all their years they\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I got paid. Felt bad, would have felt worse if I didn\u2019t restack it for pennies on the dollar compared to the gentlemen working with me, breathing in the mold. Lessons are learned through pain.",

I didn\u2019t see it tell the truck in front of me moved over to the right lane. \nSurprisingly zero damage, I think it was probably one of those cheap compressed board desks. If it woulda been a solid oak desk am sure I woulda lost a tire. \n\nIn my car a guy lost a bicycle , ( kid size ) directly in front of me. I swerved and missed it. I chased the truck down, flipping all my lights on and off. I think he thought I was a road rage case until I told him he lost a bike 3/4 of a mile back.",
