It's funny because I checked my tires that morning and through to myself that they were getting low but they still had lots of thread left, like they'd pass inspection.  But that reduction in grip made a difference. I started the slide, corrected it but as soon as it hooks up you start sliding the other way so I went back and fourth like 5 times before I was able to hold it. It's a strange feeling until you experience it. I drift cars too, some people think if they can drift a car they can handle it but those people aren't drifting at double highway speeds. It's quite different.",

I don't know any of that but it's the same as me saying the msf starter and advanced course should be mandatory before you ride anything over 250cc on the street and some kid should not be allowed to purchase a liter bike as their first bike. Power of cars (and to an extent, bikes) has gone up dramatically, accident rates and distracted driving is up, it's clearly and visibly a growing problem, I don't see any other practical solution to a real, statistically provable issue other than self driving cars and getting rid of bikes which is silly. If skill and requirements go up then accident rates will likely go down. The original comment mentioned nothing about gender or substance abuse. This \"person\" is clearly out of control and has no buisness doing what their doing or have the knowledge to do it safely. Nor should anyone do shit like this on a public road and they should lose their license.",
