Obviously in this video my clutch is pulled in. This has been happening for awhile now and I finally got it on video. I\u2019ve been noticing when the bike shuts off, it has a click sound to it, you can hear it in the video. Any ideas on what could cause this problem? ",

Kickstand sensor wouldn\u2019t go off in neutral, and the tip over sensor going off wouldn\u2019t let me start the bike back up. Normally if you drop the bike, you have to turn it on and off to reset the sensor. At least, from my understanding",

These bikes  need to have sparkplugs changed every 12k km and sychro made at the same time. \nBut I'll start from the simplest :) Good luck!",

Flash it back to stock and compare.  \n\nIf not then like others said it could be your battery/stator, side stand sensor, clutch switch sensor, kill switch, or tip over sensor.  I would test them each in that order.  However I'd definitely start with looking into the tune because if it were one of those sensors causing the bike to shut off it wouldn't just happen while you're stopped at a light it would happen on it's own while moving and if it were the  battery/stator it wouldn't start right back up.",
