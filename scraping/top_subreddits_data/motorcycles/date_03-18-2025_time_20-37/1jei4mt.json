He gets posted all over the internet as a joke, but he's actually made great strides in disability advocacy.\n\n\nMy memory is that he has bone spurs in his hip that make it incredibly painful (essentially impossible) to walk or drive a car. Skating, however, allows him to get around without severe pain. I think he has a whole diagram on his website about the biomechanics. Essentially he can move his legs laterally but not back and forth.\n\n\nHe used to take public transit to and from work, but he got kicked off the train because of his skates. I'm pretty sure he actually got banned from BART or CalTrain, just for using skates as a mobility aid.\u00a0Then he got a motorcycle because it was better than becoming wheelchair bound or taking an expensive taxi everyday.\n\n\nThe bike has modified rearsets to accommodate the skates. Despite the kneejerk reaction that most people have when they see it, riding with the skates is no more dangerous than riding in regular shoes. If you plant your feet in line with the bike, they're not gonna slip to the side. The pegs sit between the wheels, so it's not like his foot will fly off. He's not dragging his feet on the freeway. They're hard and abrasion resistant, so they provide similar protection to a riding shoe (not that it really matters, dude barely wears any gear lol).\n\n\nToo bad he's a fucking fascist though.",

I approached him in a friendly way asking how he rides with those on. I don\u2019t recall what he said exactly, because he just started ranting about being disabled and how the government was discriminating against him on public transit. He very much came off as a huge asshole, so I just listened to his rant for a minute before wishing him well and walking away.",
