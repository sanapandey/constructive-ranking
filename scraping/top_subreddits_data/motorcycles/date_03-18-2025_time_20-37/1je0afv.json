I'm thinking I should ask for at least $1,500 but I could probably push for 3k.",

            "body": "That's a Yamaha Virago XV1100, and it's in very good condition. It's got a drive shaft, which is heavy, but requires virtually no maintenance. Those bags are aftermarket, as is the sissy bar, if I'm not mistaken. The exhausts are modified, but that was very common practice with this model. I think it also has aftermarket mirrors, which is also quite common, because the original mirrors were very small. I've never seen that paint job, but it looks great. The crash bars at the front of the engine, with the highway peddles are aftermarket, and so are the leather covers on the brake and clutch levers. \n\nThese bikes are old (I think this model is from '98), but incredibly reliable. Besides regular maintenance, like replacing the fluids, they only seem to need a new battery every couple of years, especially when it's been sitting idle for a couple of months during the winter. Great bike for smaller people, often recommended as a good bike for women. Very easy to handle and absolutely perfect as a beginner bike. The suspension has a lot of soft travel, making it a very comfortable ride. However, it can make it a bit mushy, so a lot of people replaced their springs. \n\nThis was the last American cruiser model Yamaha made, before switching to their Star line-up with the Drag Star 650 & 1100 (in the US they created a new brand called Star Bikes, in the rest of the world it was still just Yamaha). The Virago was their predecessor and you can see its influence through all of them. Yamaha no longer makes cruiser bikes, sadly. \n\nI sold my Virago 750 a few years back for \u20ac1000. But it wasn't nearly in as good a condition as this bike looks like. However, it was worth so much more in my heart, after having ridden it all over Europe for 16 years. My advice would be to either cherish it and make some new memories, or try to find a collector. They're becoming increasingly rare, especially in a great condition like this. But regular dealers probably won't give you much for it anymore.",
