It's small enough that it doesn't flap and/or scratch anything. When I'm not riding I just snap the carabiner to my car/house keyring to keep it together with my other keys. What you have there will be fine, just unsnap the bike key, keep your other keys in your pocket or bag, and then reattach it once you're done riding.",
