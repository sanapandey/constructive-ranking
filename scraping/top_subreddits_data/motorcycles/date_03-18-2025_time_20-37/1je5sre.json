The stock mirrors suck and dropping it will bust a lever and be annoying. \n\nAfter a few hundred miles don\u2019t be afraid to service your forks and replace the oil. Oem fork oil is notoriously bad and it\u2019s an easy job to do that will reap rewards in feel, comfort and give you confidence of working on your bike yourself. Pro tip, use ATF for fork oil. It\u2019s 8 weight and cheap. \n\nDo all the service yourself if you are so inclined. Shops don\u2019t give a fuck and this is a \u201ccheap bike\u201d that the techs won\u2019t be excited to work on. So the effort will reflect their lack of care.
