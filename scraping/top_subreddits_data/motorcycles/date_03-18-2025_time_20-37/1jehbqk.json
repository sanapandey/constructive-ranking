    "selftext": "Hello! I'm the one that drove my bike from  the dealership and crashed it (twice). I took everyone's advice and I thank everyone who gave advice.\n\nI safely got it to a parking lot and I practiced for two hours. Safely stopping and turning, u-turning, figure 8s, turning tight curves. I briefly went on the public road successfully went into second gear and got back into another parking lot. \n\nBecause of my crash I've kinda developed a fear of right turning now, so I did that a couple times to retrain my body to relax.\n\nI felt so much more comfortable and excited now that I'm in a safer environment and understanding my bike more. I'm going to try to practice around my area and coming to this parking lot once a week. \n\nNot stopping guys \u270c\ud83c\udffe\n\nThanks again guys.\n\nP.S.\n\nI know I'm not wearing proper pants. The one I ordered was too small and the new ones haven't arrived yet. I felt very unsafe wearing just jeans but I made sure to be very careful.",

            "body": "My advice from my squid days. It\u2019s hard, but be who you want to be on the bike. \n\n#1- Know your breaks. Like literally know them. If your manual says it can stop at X MPH feet\u2026. Draw chalk lines and do half speed and half distance . Keep working your way up. IMO most crashes are from bikers not knowing how to break, slide, maneuver in the blink of an eye. \n\n#2- draw check that resembles a left turn at a light. Start from 0 like it turned green and stay in your lane (pretend turn last 2 lanes.) do not look at the road or right in front. Eyes on where you are going. \n\n#3- as you get better start to cruise to a turn and accelerate towards it with eyes on the prizes. \n\nIMO - accelerating is easy. Top speed Easier. Gear is easy. \n\nYou master your brakes\u2026. Like really master\u2026. And you master turning , you are fan into the game. There is a lot more but for me, those for me early. \n\nDon\u2019t get hung up on stalling at a red light. Who gives a fuck. Stay loud, head on a swivel, watch for people missing you coming into your lane.",
