    "selftext": "I'm pretty new the fitness world. I'm not morbidly obese or anything but I have quite a bit of weight to lose and don't have a background in strength training.\n\nThe only non-Planet Fitness gym convenient to me is an old-school \"meathead\" gym that's known in the area as a hardcore powerlifting gym. It's also super cheap at $35 a month. My question is would I be super out of place at this gym as a total noob? My concern is not so much being intimidated per se as it is just being in the way and preventing more serious lifter bros from getting their workouts in. I have big time social anxiety about these things and when I go to gyms I find myself constantly comparing myself and feeling physically inferior to other guys there. Which in practice usually means I don't make it too far outside of the cardio area.\n\nI'm not opposed to going to PF but do want to use free weights which my local PF doesn't have apart from dumbbells. This other gym is within easy walking distance which I feel makes it more likely that I would actually go.\n\n**EDIT:** I can't respond individually to every comment but thank you guys so much! Wasn't expecting so many replies. I'm going to sign up for a membership tomorrow. ",

I don't like it when new people screw around, talk on the phone, scroll on the phone,  take pictures/videos or act like a jackasses. Otherwise, I love seeing new people in the gym that are there to better themselves. Every community loves having people around that are trying to get better. For me personally,  It is motivating for me. I was there too. I started at 460 lbs 6 years ago. Everyone had a starting point. If you are there to put in the work and not screw around, great to have you!",
