I hope that this tradition continues between the two of you, and if you ever have children, consider passing it along to them. My dad and I used to go for walks in our sleepy town after everyone was home and the shops were closed. It was very interesting to see glimpses of photos on the wall of the home that didn't pull their shades right after sunset. Without being creepy and invasive, just walking by and seeing literally through a window into somebody's life, brought about a closeness to who we are as people and how we individually express ourselves. Even though I obviously didn't have a romantic relationship with my father, we still got to hypothesize and imagine what people's lives looked like based on the illuminated wall behind the forgotten shade that we passed by with a normal gate in the evening...",

Since I am trying to be self aware and take accountability for my shortcomings, I am going to go into work and apologize to my coworkers and sincerity. It will be a moment vulnerability, especially when it is not easy to admit wrongdoing and that we are not perfect but trying to improve. It's a humbling experience, you have to shatter your ego, and be willing to expose the weak points to others in order to move forward and grow. Now with that scenario I do not feel that there is any intimacy involved whatsoever. I don't feel like I have to intimately know anybody before I am vulnerable with them. \nHere is another example. I have just started to fall in love with somebody, let's call it the honeymoon phase. At this point in the relationship I feel as if I can share intimate conversation or moments of touch without feeling as if I am vulnerable. Even though sometimes with some people this could be different.... I would be happy to share more examples if you still need clarification. However, I don't think that anything I can say about how my experience with partnership love and security is, will be satisfactory enough for you to agree that it is possible for some people to have intimacy without vulnerability and for you to require both of those things.",

First I would like to say, that if I am talking about one thing and you are talking about another, then nobody could be right or wrong, right? To answer the second question, I am very comfortable sharing intimate details about my life; for example I will talk to you complete strangers about my experience being assaulted as a child... Obviously I don't just walk around telling people this, but if it happens to come up in conversation I can share my experience with others that I normally wouldn't tell somebody at the check stand. That is an intimate part of my life because it is something that has shaped me and I hold close. However I do not feel vulnerable when I share this. To be vulnerable would mean that I would feel as if this information could be used to harm me or against me in any fashion. I know that if somebody tried to weaponize this information, I would give it absolutely no second thought. There are certain things that we are vulnerable about because of insecurity or past wounds. I certainly have plenty of these. I also have many things that no longer feel vulnerable, even though they are not commonly known.",

I do however feel vulnerable in other aspects of a relationship, for example if I do not self betray and hold boundaries, I feel incredibly vulnerable. Because in that sense I have something to lose.

However, I definitely experience a lot of situations that require my vulnerability, and willingness to be open, in order to establish intimacy. So hopefully that clarifies my ability to see both sides of the fence.... My question however, was specific in stating times that you experience intimacy with a partner with out vulnerability or sexuality. I am grateful to hear everybody's perspective.
