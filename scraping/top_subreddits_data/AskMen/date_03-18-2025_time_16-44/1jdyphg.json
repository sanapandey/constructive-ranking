A girl on a bike going quite fast cut between us quite roughly and I remember my friend Stephen yelling out after her that she'd get run over riding like that. Our anger turning to horror quite quickly. 10-15 meters ahead of us  she was rapidly approaching a T intersection. This wasn't a main highway or anything, but a quiet street in Noosa, Australia. As she approached the corner, a semi-trailer truck was turning into the corner. It wasn't going particularly quick or anything but as it slowed and turned into the corner she somehow noticed it very late and hit the brakes on her bike, unfortunately she really squeezed the front brake hard and went flying over the handlebars, onto the road and beneath the rear most wheels of the second small trailer. Luckily it was empty as coming back the other way it'd have been loaded up with rock from some construction site it was headed to.\n\nThe truck was already hard on the brakes before she went under. It'd stopped completely before we finished running up and I still remember the sick sounding scream coming from the big truck driver. She was alive, but in a bad way. Really bad. This was in the summer in Australia and a particularly hot day. The kind of day where the bitumen on the road gets sticky. She'd been mangled pretty badly, the spokes from the wheel of her bike looked like they'd sliced open her thigh really bad and I remember being surprised that the fat from her leg was kind of orange. As we got to her, I saw my mother running down the hill towards us on her phone calling an ambulance. She shooed us away home and stayed to help. The sad footnote to it all was hearing later that her Dad upon hearing of the accident and rushing to the hospital was in a serious car crash.\n\nI think being a callow youth helped shield me from the real horror of it. I felt bad because immediately prior to the accident I'd been wishing ill upon her but I don't remember being super traumatized over it. I didn't know her, I don't know how her recovery or anything went. Hopefully well.\n\n  \nI also saw in 2013 someone get taken by a crocodile. That was a thing.",

Suddenly i hear tyres screech, and a loud crash. \n\na van ran a red light, and crashed in to a volvo 850 (that's one of those seriously heavy old volvo sw's  )  coming from the right on the main way going 70 km/h (approx 45mph). \n\nAfter that, it's silent. a few sec. later the kid in the Volvo starts crying and it's mother is also moving. The person in the Van has turned his flat windshield in to a bowl with his head. (not wearing seatbelts apperently ) When the paramedics take the mom and kid away, the police opens the door of the van. The guy is dead obviously, but i never forget all the blood dripping from the soaked seat on to the asphalt. \n\nThis was about 40 years a go, and i can still recall this in plenty of details. Getting over it?  Well even back then, i considered it a fact of life. That's just it. Shit happens. No one intends to be in an accident, or to be struck by lightning. Still it happens. You can point the blame to someone sometimes, but it doesn't change anything. Like in this case: the guy ran a red light, he's to blame, most likely he didn't intended the outcome with him being dead. \n\nThe only thing you can do, is to live your life.

My spouse doesn't want to hear me talk about blood all over the road, or a missing body part. And I don't want to tell them these things and maybe my kids hear it too. And nobody else wants to hear about it either, and sometimes it's just too much to keep inside.\"\n\nWe were in a small, rural town and the local government over us would not provide any type of counseling.

It can help you forget, for a long while, but the trauma will come back when triggered.
