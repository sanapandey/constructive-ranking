I actually weigh more today than I did when I was technically my fattest, but a significant amount of it is because I lost a lot of fat and packed on a lot of muscle. I'm more comfortable in my skin today because this is the body I've built through hard work and discipline. It's not perfect but at least it's mine.",

So I did weightlifting to add some muscle definition and now look and feel even better. HOWEVER, because of all the weight loss I have excess skin in my belly area. No matter how good I feel and think I look, that excess skin bothers me to no end. It\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t get rid of no matter how hard I work. I hate it and wish I could get rid of it. I\u2019m even ashamed to take off my shirt still in public because of it. I look like a totally different person and should be proud, but it bothers me too much. \nSo even after all the work, I\u2019m not completely satisfied. That\u2019s not to say I regret it tho. I am very much more happy now than I was then.",

Wanted to build muscle and get strong now I\u2019ve done that and still self conscious about the gut. So now I\u2019m on a cut again trying to burn fat and maybe see some definition.
