Sounds dumb, but people are dumb. And you probably wouldn't assume right off the bat that most women like nerdy hobbies unless they had something like an anime shirt on, right? Which isn't something most women wear, period. So you wouldn't talk to them about it right off the bat either. \n\nI'm saying it's a possibility that you don't get far enough with the girls you want to date to figure out that they have the same hobbies you do because you're giving off red flags.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't seem like you're open to other perspectives, so... I guess have fun trying the same things and getting the same results you were before? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Yes it's rare for women to wear \"nerdy\" shirts and other visual cues. In my experience only some women do.\n\n> I personally don't talk about hobbies I have that are male-dominated until I get to know someone a bit, because sometimes men stop treating you like a normal person if you do.

Initially, the coworker claimed the baby was her ex\u2019s, but when her ex didn\u2019t believe her, she was forced to admit the baby is my friend\u2019s.\n\nUnfortunately, my friend found out about her deception before she could tell him herself. He\u2019s furious and confronted her, demanding to know why she lied. She admitted that she didn\u2019t tell him because she thought he wasn\u2019t \u201cadult enough\u201d to be a father. This deeply hurt him, as it felt like a blow to his character. In the heat of the moment, he said some hurtful things and has since refused to talk to her. He\u2019s even stopped attending work, despite being asked to return.\n\nMy friend is generally a great guy\u2014straightforward, earnest, and very respectful\u2014until he feels disrespected. He has a history of being bullied and ridiculed by women, which has affected him deeply. This situation seems to have reopened those old wounds. \n\nAnother friend tried to convince him that if he doesn\u2019t step up to help his coworker and their baby, he\u2019d be proving her right, that he isn\u2019t adult enough. However, this only made him angrier. He said he has nothing to prove, especially to someone he sees as a liar. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve heard the coworker is having a hard time managing the pregnancy alone.\n\nI want to help my friend, but he\u2019s become volatile and feels like we\u2019re all ganging up on him. What can I do to support him in moving forward while helping him see the bigger picture?",

So I chose to take to celibacy until recently. But in that time, I've realized; there's a lot of things I find annoying in a lot of women. When I see it, I often just distance cuz I don't want that energy around me. It's made me slow down & cherish my singlehood. Am I alone on the irritations or am I just bristled by time lol?",

It seems so strange. \n\nTo be fair maybe he thought he was being funny for his own amusement and probly is a great guy & people make mistakes or don't understand what is generally socially acceptable but this could vary based on your two dynamic or how he is as a person.

All the men you know are by no means representative of men as a whole. This goes for everyone, including myself.\n\nYou should consider that there's such a thing as confirmation bias, as well as pure coincidence.  \nLike, take my own upbringing and background as an example. I have a lesbian mother, am neurodivergent, and am married to a woman from South Africa. So I am part of three completely seperate minority groups in my country. Is that somehow connected? No. Not at all. Its mere coincicende. At most you could say that due to my upbringing in a tolerant household I am not biased towards people of colour, but that honestly feels like a stretch; there are plenty of people in my circle of friends who have similar values as I do, and have had a very different upbringing.\n\nAgain, and a TLDR: The men around you are a trivial sample size. And your observations could *maybe* tell something about men in your circle of aquaitances, but generalizing this to all men (all 4 Billion of them) is a massive overstretch.\n\nLets say you know 1000 men, hypothetically. Which would be a massive circle of aquaitances.   \nThen that would be a sample size of 0.000025% of all men on earth. And not even a representative one, as they are unlikely to be from more than a dozen cultures and sub cultures, personal backgrounds, ways of life.\n\nOr, to simplify: Since you mention family members, if all of your male family members are jerks, then this tells us more about your family, and nothing about men in general :) And I don't mean this as an attack on you.

Most women know that yes, you are gonna think with your wandering dick sometimes. It's only when the thinking gets in the way of your REAL relationship that there's an issue.
