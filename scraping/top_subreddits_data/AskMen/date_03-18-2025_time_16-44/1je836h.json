Like all body care people respond differently to products so experiment and have some fun. But as a couple of suggestions.\n\nGet some beard wash/condition. Helps keep the skin and hair clean and healthy. I tend to was fairly regularly and condition every few days.\n\nI actually personally prefer beard balm to oil I find my skin and hair absorb it better.\n\nLike a lot of body care more natural ingredients are often better.\n\nBrush your beard, not only does it just feels nice but it helps \"train\" the direction of hair and helps keep it clear of any dry skin.\n\nDab your beard dry or let it air dry, don't bear to rough as that can break hair and cause split ends.\n\nMost of all find what works for you and have fun with it.",

Smells incredible...I think it's sandalwood...because why wouldn't men's products be *that* scent? However, there may be some sort of conditioner in it because my beard feels soft after the next shower. I've thought about oils or balms, but I'm wondering how well they'll really work. I'd say my beard hairs are about an inch long, but I typically shave it with a beard trimmer with a #1 cover on it. Nice, low profile, easy to maintain, but I wanted to grow it out a bit and see what happens",
