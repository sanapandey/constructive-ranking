I've gotten some offers because I would be working in a bilingual necessary role. But that is all dependant on where you are currently and the needs of your industry. \n\nIf you are in a 90% English speaking country working for a company that only services people within that country, then it won't be necessary. If, however, the product suppliers you have are in a different country and speak a different language, congrats you have just made yourself potentially very important to maintaining accurate relations.",
