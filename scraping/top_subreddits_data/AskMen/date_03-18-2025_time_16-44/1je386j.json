And a card from all the lads on the Ark Royal.  Amazing that she remembered and took the time to do that.  I was already soppy for her before that, but a total goner after that.  I still have it and her 22 years later.",

It really sucks to hurt someone that treats you like that so I'm at my best around her because I want to be, because she deserves me treating her as well as she treats me.  It makes me happy to see her happy.  Not because she asks for it or gives me an attitude when I'm not.

She somehow knew every single aspect of this dream and she was completely accurate on all of it.
