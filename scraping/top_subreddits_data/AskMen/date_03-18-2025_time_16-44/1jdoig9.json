I was working with this other pregnant girl who is like, American preppy weirdo. \nWe didn't get on and our only small talk was about our pregnancies. She asked how I was doing and I said fine other than PGP/SPD. She says hers was horrendous then got out her phone and was like look, let me show you. And she gets her phone out and basically shows me a video she took of herself crying at the camera. I'm just thinking when I'm in this much pain with it the last thing I'd think to do is \" oh shit this hurts so bad, let me record myself crying to show everyone I'm in pain\". I honestly didn't know how to react. This new generation is craaaaazzzyyyy. When I'm in that much pain my only thought is how the fuck do I continue up these stairs.",

While the other objected on the sheer premise that it would be completely one-sided because she doesn\u2019t attract alot of women. While the other one was more conventionally attractive.

Like i appreciate the open communication, i understand the desire to wanna sleep with other people, but it just seems shallow. \n\nOne of my close friends was poly for nearly 5yrs and in that time she pretty much grew to dislike it for the very obvious problems that come with it. Those problems mainly being that the type of people that lifestyle attracts aren\u2019t necessarily long term material and also because there is no foundation in the relationship. You\u2019re pretty much on shakey grounds with every new partner you\u2019re with. Because why would you ever communicate or problem solve when you can be easily replaced. \n\nThe only people i seen who successfully practice polyamory are attractive couples who been together for like 10yrs and wanna open up the relationship. Cause by that point you guys already have a rock solid foundation and enough trust to know that it wont derail the relationship. Plus you\u2019re both attractive, so getting partners isn\u2019t that big of an imbalance",

A single *drop* of alcohol is bad for you. No amount of alcohol, however miniscule, is harmless from a health standpoint. This has been quite concretely established in modern medicine. \n\nTo be clear I have no inherent problem with the stuff (I actually like it very much), and a few drinks here and there won't kill you, but the logic you use for tobacco users would most certainly apply to alcohol users as well. As a matter of fact, I'd say alcohol is much more immediately dangerous to your health than a cigarette would be, and if you do happen to get addicted, the withdrawals can throw you into a state of tremoring and delirium before literally killing you as opposed to just making you irritable and anxious for a week.",

They feel this so deeply but don\u2019t understand that people of other religions/beliefs feel the exact same way about their god. So they see these people who feel the same about another religion as demonic. It\u2019s sad and impedes on personal and humanity\u2019s growth.
