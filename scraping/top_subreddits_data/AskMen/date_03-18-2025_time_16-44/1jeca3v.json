I have that all now, and my parents would get angry about anytime I didn\u2019t do something right or in a stressful situation, then they get mad at me now because that anger they taught me I\u2019m sending back. I get angry mostly because they interfere with my schedule a lot, it\u2019s part of growing up, being busy, but I always make sure to put time aside for my family, but I don\u2019t know what it is for parents to realize that I am not available like I used to, and I refuse to feel bad for that because they grew up lecturing me to grow up to be someone, and sometimes you need to do that journey alone.

Not that you\u2019ll be perfect, but you can choose to be different. \n\nFor now, do what you need to do to grow and thrive.
