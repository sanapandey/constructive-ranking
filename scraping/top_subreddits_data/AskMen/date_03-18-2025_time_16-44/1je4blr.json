God there\u2019s so many parts to this story, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it, but it happened, so I might as well just tell it. Long story short, I was in a hotel for a wedding. A bunch of us chipped in and got rooms. My exwife and I were right at the end of our marriage, so I went solo. One of the guest\u2019s girlfriends had recently found out that her boyfriend was cheating with like five or six different girls. My wife at the time was fooling around on me as well, so we had a little something to bond over. So, anyway, several of us were dead asleep the morning after the wedding and some had decided to get an early start to beat traffic home. \n\nSo, her bf I did consider a friend for years, but then he started a fist fight at my own wedding. That was kind of what started the end of my marriage. So I was quite bitter towards him. His gf and I had gotten along really well and I met her right as I started dating the exwife. So, the conversation was that we were both at the end of our ropes and we should just part ways with the SO\u2019s and run away together. I think everyone has had a conversation with someone like that at some point in their lives. \n\nSo, I was out cold, she came to say goodbye at the bed I was sleeping on. Thought I was being funny when I pulled her down on top of me, and gave her the hug of a lifetime. Then, that two second pause of silence happened. I was still married, she was still with dude, we both did the right thing and just said goodbye. However, she gave me a raging hard on. Then the unthinkable. Her bf called me outside to say goodbye to him. \n\nI said *fuck it*. Maybe this was a good time to start a new life and leave everything that was stressful behind. So, I hopped out of bed and just went out in my boxers with a noticeable, shall we say, wrinkle, sticking out. What I didn\u2019t notice was another friend sitting in a chair right in front of the door to the room. He shouted JESUS DUDE and yanked my bazooka Joe boxers down, only it took some effort because my boner was sticking straight out and my boxers were getting caught on it. \n\nI just owned it. My close circle of friends all saw my erect junk. Just to take away some of the awkward moments, I waved my hand bye to the bf and shook my hips to wave my dick bye to the gf. \n\nEnd of story, they ended up getting married and divorced a few weeks later, I ended up divorcing right as she got married. Happy ending for both of us though, we both found great partners and lead very happy lives now.",

It was a goopy, muddy mess for the game.  But that was part of the fun.\n\nAbout two third of the game through the opposing team ran a sweep, handing the ball off to this shifty, very quick, very fast kid.  I was playing in the defensive backfield.  I read the play, saw the corner was open for him to turn up field.  I took an angle.  Just as he turned the corner I dove and wrapped my arms his torso between his chest and waist.  We were all wet and covered in mud at this point.\n\nMy arms slid down his body.  I grabbed hold of his warmups, they slid down his legs.  He deftly stepped out of them and continued running down the field.  He wasn't wearing any underwear.  Several guys down the field had a shot at him but they let him go.  Nobody wanted to wrap their arms around the naked guy.\n\nWhen I went to the sideline, my wife was there and casually said, \"That kid has a big schlung.\"\n\nI said, \"You know the worst part?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's cold out here.\"",
