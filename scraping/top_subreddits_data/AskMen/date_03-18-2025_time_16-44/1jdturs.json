    "selftext": "We hired this guy recently into our M&A team and he's quite a sharp and knowledgeable lad. Not only that but he's 6'5, the whole blonde hair, blue eyes deal, really handsome and jacked. He looks very similar to Brad Pitt in Troy. You'd think God would nerf someone that physically gifted with awkward social skills or something but nope! He's very funny, charismatic and charming too. \n\nI'm not really the type of guy to get jealous of other men about what they have and don't have since you usually don't know the full story BUT... I can't help but feel jealous. On his first day, every woman in the office was SWOONING. This one girl even offered to make him a coffee in the morning just to talk and look at him. \n\nIt's honestly kind of wild to see his effect on women in the workplace. This is supposed to be a professional setting and the ladies are going absolutely crazy. ",

Sure, his height and facial features, but that chiseled Brad Pitt in Troy body takes a lot of hard work, dedication, discipline. Most guys want to drink beer, eat bad food and watch sports or go bar hopping with friends, this guy chose his health and appearance over comfort, that takes work. \n\nHis personality? I know guys who are tall and well built who are shy af and awkward, especially around girls. That too can be worked on, this guy sounds like he worked on that as well. \n\nIs it easier to work on your personality as a 6'5\" guy with male model looks? Yes. But it's still more work put in than a lot of guys are willing to put in themselves. \n\nThen his skills at his job are also something he worked hard at, if he's actually good. He could have relied on looks more but it sounds like he took his career seriously. \n\nSo he did \"spawn in\" with a lot of qualities but he also worked hard to take advantage of them, to go from tall guy with good facial features to male model with great personality and a ton of skills. Look at this guy, take him as an example, and be something you want to aspire to. Jealousy is useless. \n\nAnd the world is full of lazy slobs who have been gifted athletic bodies and good looks but chose beer and laziness instead.",

He's tall, handsome, AND in charge of his life. Guys tend to ignore just how important that last part is for women. A guy who's just as much in charge of his life as OP's colleague is, but is shorter and has less attractive facial features, will still be popular with women. \n\nI can speak from experience, and can offer myself as a counter-example. I'm 6'4\", have always been athletic and good at sports, and I make a decent living, yet I let depression and alcoholism ruin my 20s. I've wasted a decade of my life -- and some would say the most important decade -- feeling sorry for myself and stuck in a vicious cycle of not taking care of myself (aka drinking daily and overeating) and being depressed because of it. \n\nYou think women couldn't get enough of me? The things I was lucky to get naturally at birth were nothing with a shitty personality, no self-control, no discipline, and no initiative. It's only after I woke the fuck up and took control of my life, went to a barber, got in shape etc. that women started responding positively to me. My height or my money meant nothing to them until everything else was under control too.\n\nIt's easy to look at tall, in shape, attractive guys and think they got cheat codes at life. And maybe they do, they certainly have some advantages you may not have. But to be truly successful in all areas of life, you still have to work very, very hard for it.",

How does one cope with that?\n\nYou cope with that by being the absolute best that you can be in the areas of your life you can control. Become the fittest, best looking, most in shape guy you can be and I guarantee women will pick you over a 6'5\" slob. \n\nDon't have the facial features or jawline of a Greek God? If you can grow facial hair, grow a beard, go to a barber, have it professionally lined up. Lose excess weight. So many things you can do to improve what you already have instead of bitching about not getting what others have gotten.\n\nWork on your personality. Go out there, talk to people, become charming, confident, funny. These things can be acquired skills and they will improve your social life tenfold, no matter what physical disadvantages (you think) you have. \n\nSome people were lucky enough to be born with great facial features, others were lucky to be born to millionaire parents and had a Ferrari as a birthday present. You're never going to have everything, there's always going to be someone richer, smarter, more successful, better looking, stronger, and/or more capable than you. You cope with it by only looking at those people FOR INSPIRATION, not for jealousy. \n\nOP should look at his new colleague, get to know him, find out what motivates him to get in shape and work on himself every day, and do the same. He won't be as tall or as handsome as him, but he'll be in a better place physically and mentally than he is now.",

They may admit and admire this person's beauty and charm, but sometimes that shit is just not interesting and they suffer from the inevitable envy that you're experiencing.\n\nMy advice may seem boring, but treat this person just like any other person.  Maybe treat other people better just a little bit. Use this guy as an example that you're not a shallow person.  Also, maybe use this as a motivation to improve yourself in selective ways to make yourself stand out.  You'll never compete with this person directly for women or certain friends, but that's ok you dont need that.  I think you should just adapt to the system of an inner score card psychology.  This means just judging yourself by your own core values and standards rather than everyone else's.  believe it or not, over time, this psychology helps with your own development because that's all you're responsible for and able to change.

He went to a big school. I went to a small div 1 school and had a successful career. He ended up getting addicted  to weed and not going to class and failed out of college eventually. His family tried tough love and didn't help him at all but he kept messing up and getting caught by cops for weed in the car. His dad ended up being an executive at an oil company and handed him a job. I now work as a software developer, and he makes way more money than me. But he is a great guy to grab a beer with.
