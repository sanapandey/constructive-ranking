It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ve had to actually ask myself, am I? But no I\u2019m very certain that I\u2019m straight. I\u2019ve asked a couple of people and the only answer I\u2019ve got is \u201cyou just really look after yourself\u201d - I did not know this was gay (I still don\u2019t think it is?\u00bf) \n\nDoes anyone, straight or gay, have any suggestions as to why I\u2019m giving off this vibe?

Big strong buff hyper masculine dudes make sense in our brains cause in a sense it\u2019s attainable if that makes sense.  \u201cPretty boys\u201d with softer features who take care of themselves are called gay out of a slight cope. \n\n\n\nPeople assume shit when they can\u2019t figure anything out.\n\nOur idea of masculinity is fucked in America. Geeky, pacifist behaviors aren\u2019t respected culturally jn men for the most part.\n\nWhen your friend says \u201cyou look after yourself\u201d that means you look good. It will get characterized as feminine, thus gay. I\u2019m curious if you get it mostly from men or women. If it\u2019s coming from men it\u2019s coming from a competitive place if it\u2019s coming from women\u2026.

When I was younger, I was teased a lot for being gay. Now that I'm older and have my own identity wrapped in more masculine hobbies, it's a lot less, but I still get called metro. It doesn't really affect me, I'm petty confident in my \"straightness.\" I've been married for 8 years, and my wife says I carry myself with BDE since I don't really care what people think. I race motorcycles, am good with my hands and do garage/house projects, have good outdoor skills. But I do drive a Miata, that seems to trigger people the most with comments, lol. To be fair, I've never had women assume I'm gay. It's mainly just ribbing from other dudes, but I think that says more about them than it does about me.",

My advice is to use it like a super power.  Girls will just inherently trust you more,  guys don't consider you as competition and people will just assume you are a fun and open person.  It has a lot of social perks despite a few homophobic bully problems you  may have early in life.",

I don\u2019t really care personally, I\u2019ve had kids I work with who kept calling me Ms. thelryan instead of Mr., not in a malicious way just genuinely decided to call me Ms. for whatever reason. Don\u2019t care, I\u2019m confident in myself, I know who I am, pursuing women I\u2019m interested in seems successful enough that whatever vibe I\u2019m giving off isn\u2019t hurting my chances",
