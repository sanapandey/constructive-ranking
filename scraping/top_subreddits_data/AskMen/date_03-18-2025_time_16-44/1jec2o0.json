For the last 22 years, I have lived in a small town - again, two hours from home, with the \"big town\" I grew up doing all of our shopping in almost exactly halfway between here and there.\n\nMoving to a small town where a lot of my now friends grew up here..... I hesitate to say that it changed me for the better, because I don't want to imply that I'm somehow better than the people that have lived here their whole lives. \n\nBut especially in a small town (we're talking sub-2,000 population), if you've never left town, you don't really understand how things work anywhere else.  \"when you do what you've always done, you'll get what you always got\" type of thing.\n\nThe locals got upset when our high school merged with the next town over, because the mascot changed, and the small town \"By god, I was a <mascot>, my kid is gonna be a <mascot>\".....well, I was never a <mascot>, I was a <my town's mascot>, and my job will never take me back there, so....\n\n  \nI think it's valuable to experience something different from what you grew up in.  If you want to live and work in your town, that's fine - you can come back.  But go somewhere else first.  Maybe just for a few years.  Maybe for 10 years.  But go experience somewhere else.",

Living in a different state/city with different rules and different people and different businesses and different ways of living with different needs and wants. Experiencing these differences on your worst and best days. Celebrating holidays and birthdays in this new place. All the differences are the things that challenge you as a person and lead you to growth and discovering new versions of yourself that are better than your last.\n\nThey would scream and kick at me for saying this but I know people who have never left their small Kansas town they were born in and people who have never left their 100k+ California town they were born in and both parties are equally stubborn, ignorant to new thoughts, developmentally stuck where they were in their 20's, and have outdated and incorrect assumptions of a world they've never truly seen. Vacationing somewhere and spending a week in a hotel will never give you the type of growth that being 24/7/365 in a place will. \n\nYou don't need to go to LA or NYC or Chicago, but if you can at the very least get to a neighboring state you'd be shocked by how much you'll learn and grow. It's an absolute disservice to yourself and your future to stay in your home town your entire life and the insecurities that prevent people from leaving (fears, anxieties, biases, etc) will only get worse as time goes on. So leave unless your dream is to be that \"I could've gone pro if it weren't for that injury my senior year and now I've been working a job I don't like with a family I don't like for the last 40 years and I take my personal regret out on others\" person we all have met at least once.",

Being around the people I went to school with would only depress me so far as the ones that did much better than I did. I didn't want to continue to run into everyone I went to highschool with for the rest of my life. \n\nThere is a whole world out there. Different experiences. Clean slates. Different climates. Different cultures..I couldn't bear letting it all pass by. \n\nAnd when I do go back to visit, I am always glad to leave again.",

But I still more or less grew up with the local kids because I would often spend my summer vacations at my grandparents or other relatives.\n\nSuffice to say, I haven't been back since my grandparents passed away. Because the people I grew up with who never left town are now bitter, judgmental middle-aged adults. Mad at the world with a chip on their shoulder because they lacked the ambition and initiative to experience anything in the world beyond their favorite bar stool. \n\nIt's a shame, because I really do have a lot of fond memories of that town. But if I were to move there or retire there, I know I'd be perpetually treated like the new kid in high school.\n\nNow my niece and nephew are growing up in a town not far from there, but I make it a point to have my sister bring them to the city a few times a year so they know there's more to life and out in the world for them than what they know from small town Wisconsin.",

They're proud of me today, but it was tough for everyone.\n\nLeaving home, you lose a layer of your safety net. Sure, I could always go back, but I put myself into a position where I left my country and it was truly sink-or-swim. I had to learn how to be a man, but also specifically, an Asian man in the West.\n\nA lot of mistakes were made, and some lessons took a long time to learn, but I would have never had the opportunity to experience the pressure needed to become a diamond.",

My mental image is of middle-aged losers hanging out in their hometown bar, talking about their high school glory days and complaining about their dead-end jobs. I once met a dude who proudly bragged -- yes, frickin' *bragged* \\-- that he's never set foot out of his home state. He wasn't even a young guy. He was at least late-middle-aged. My best guess would be mid-50s to early-60s-ish.\n\nI've traveled to a lot of different places, and I've lived in a handful of different places, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. People who never even *gently rub* at the surface are weird. I mean, there's a whole world out there. Are they really *that* devoid of curiosity and adventurousness? I can't wrap my head around it.\n\nAnd, I mean, I *like* my hometown. I'm proud to be from there. I legitimately think it's a cool place to live, with a vibrant art and culture scene, a few good sports teams to follow, and a lot of fun stuff to see and do. I just can't imagine spending my entire life in one place. I never could.",

All the people you already know.  All the people you could ask for help if you ever needed anything.  You didn't have any of that if you move.",
