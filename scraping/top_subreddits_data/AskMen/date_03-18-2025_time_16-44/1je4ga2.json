My mother's boyfriend started fights with me all the time, growing up. When I got older and started fighting back, he'd just call the police and paint me as the aggressor. After a particularly bad instance, I spent over a year dealing with the juvenile probation system after an arrest and a stay in juvie. The cops in my area hated all teenagers, so they hardly questioned his account. My mother was of no help, either, in fact I don't believe there was a single adult in the house.",

Every day that guy had something derogatory to say about me in an attempt to get a rise out of me. He was intentionally pushing my buttons. He thought of himself as a badass and often talked about getting into fights, again, to intimidate me. I could handle the verbal bullying and just let it go. I talked to the teacher about being moved, more than once. She did nothing. But one day he wadded up a piece of paper and threw it at my face as hard as he could. I have no memory of what happened next. I was told I came across the table, tackled him, and started reigning blows down on his face. My memory of it comes back when about 4 guys are pulling me off of him and holding me back. \n\nI was yelling at the teacher, \"I told you!!!! I told you to move me, because he would not stop!!!\" I was sent to the office. My folks were shocked. This was MAJORLY out character for me. No one denied the guy threw the wad of paper at my face. But I reiterated to my folks in front of the principal and the teacher, I had asked her to be moved more than once. She outright denied it and I called her a liar to her face. In the end, I got suspended for a couple of days. My folks were so incensed by teacher doing nothing and the principal not caring that this was a bullying case they told the principal, \"we're taking him out to eat to celebrate.\" That REALLY goaded the principal. And my dad said, \"this is only going to keep happening until y'all take bullied students seriously.\" \n\nThey ended up moving that kid to another science class. When I saw him again, he had a HUGE black eye and face still swollen. All the way school up to high school graduation, he looked the other way if our paths cross. In fact, I'm not aware of that guy ever getting into trouble or bullying anyone else.\n\nI know this is not a popular sentiment, but unfortunately, some people need to get hit in the face to make better life choices and leave others alone.",

What makes you tough is your ability to recognize your feelings and still be able to get stuff done like a man.  Sometimes that means setting boundaries and telling somebody to knock it off.  Don't let anyone disrupt your inner peace, it's not worth it.  Look for friends that want to lift you up and want you to be the best version of you that you can be.

Report everything if they are persistent assholes. Tell them it's negatively impacting you. I was bullied a little in school and i got the WORST advice which is to ignore them. Do not, i repeat, do not ignore a bully. \"oh they will get bored\" no, they know why you're ignoring them. You have to fight them/tease them back. And you will respect yourself more for it. Action will always be better than inaction in the scenario.\n\nI'm still angry about some bullies that got the best of me in highschool. Take my advice and make their lives as difficult as possible until they back off. A friend does not bully another friend. I know when i go too far with someone, and i adjust.

You got any answers? No? Ok, shut the hell up then.\"***\n\nYour milage may vary but the common thread I've seen is the instigator has no thoughts beyond pointing out whatever the flaw is and then standing back and basking in the adulation while the target says nothing out of shame.\n\nWhen they get called out on the fact that all they did was point out the obvious, they usually don't have a plan B. This can sometimes stop others in the group from repeating the action because they see no gain from it in the future.\n\nHowever, you say this is your friends. Ok, this is tough but this is what I would do now if a friend or family member acted this way towards me: Just be honest with them.\n\n***\"Hey guys, what you say hurts. I get that you're trying to be funny and maybe it was the first few times but now I just feel shitty. Can we stop? The world sucks enough as it is. We don't need to make it worse on ourselves. If anything, if we're friends, we should have each other's backs and support each other.\"***\n\nIf I could go back in time, this is what I would have done as a kid because people who suck just waste your time and end up not being worth all the pain and agony they put you through in life.\n\nHowever, if they suck as people, they might get huffy that you are saying that you don't want to feel bad anymore because that makes them feel guilty for being mean to someone else. That makes them angry, cause they don't want to feel bad and can't realize why they feel this way.\n\nSo, instead of being self reflective and vulnerable, acknowledging the consequences of their actions and changing their behavior in the future, they double down on being an asshole. In the 80s & 90s when I was young, they would call you a homosexual slur as this was the limit to their imagination in most cases. Not sure if this is still true with young bullies in this day and age but I wouldn't be surprised if it is.\n\nIf that's their response, I'd stop hanging out with them. But that can be hard, especially at 14 because your social circles are pretty limited by your inability to leave your current area.",

They might stop and respecting your not comfortable.\n\n2) verbally tell them \u2018please stop doing that, I don\u2019t like it\u2019. If they stop that\u2019s all good but if they continue and pressure, then it\u2019s time to either really step up and stop associating with them or report it to school officials and how it\u2019s continuing\u2026 maybe they aren\u2019t your friends.\n\nMy son was bullied by dick heads in middle school.
