    "selftext": "I saw a post in another (feminine focused) sub that said something along the lines of \u2018men who come here think it\u2019s about man hating\u2019. I visit that sub occasionally and find it\u2019s rampant with sexism against men. Do any other men experience this in feminine spaces that they visit, or am I just overly sensitive to it?\n\nPlease no gender bashing or sexism, and with all due respect, I\u2019m only looking for answers from men.\n\nI am also relatively new to this sub, so I hope I\u2019m not breaking any rules here.\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for sharing their experiences. I see that a lot of men who commented here feel that they do experience this, and I am glad for the few who haven\u2019t. I honestly think it\u2019s ultimately men\u2019s responsibility to help men, and I think we need help. So please, read each other\u2019s posts and support each other. Of course we have to hold each other accountable, but we don\u2019t have to hate one another, that\u2019s useless to us.",

Guys teasing each other about who is a better volleyball player certainly isn't toxic masculinity. I'd argue whatever social elements produce guys who actually take that kind of thing to heart are more toxic. \n\nNobody ever seems to be able to frame toxic masculinity by providing examples of positive masculinity (positive and wholesome expectations for being a man) that don't just end up being generally positive traits like kindness or confidence; these aren't traits specific to masculinity.

Society also judges men on attributes connected to performance and competition like strength, achievements and salary. This can lead to men having the feeling that they need to be better than others in certain areas to secure their place in social hierarchies.\n* Men are trained to not show most emotions because it's seen as weak and feminine. One exception is anger this can lead to men either releasing all their emotions through anger or men suppressing their feelings until they surface in an aggressive outburst.\n* Gay men are seen as less masculine and weaker than heterosexual men in a patriarchal society this leads to men avoiding looks and behaviors that are linked to homosexuality to avoid being seen as feminine and weak. This can develop into derogatory behavior against gay men to showcase your own masculinity. Furthermore homosexuals tend to break traditional gender roles which is often seen as an attack by people who define themselves through strict gender roles.",

No, it's benevolent misogyny, women are victims of being treated well.\n\nWhen women are sexist toward other women, that's internalized misogyny. When men are sexist toward other men, that's toxic masculinity.

I've been on that sub many many times and the single comment I would've posted was, \"This may not officially be a man hating sub, but there's plenty of unchecked hate for men to be found here.\"\n\nI see a lot of posts/comments about certain exclusive spaces. Anything critical about those spaces being exclusionary are met with \"every space is a man space\" or \"every space is a yt space\" (btw I would never myself write 'yt') meaning that men are allowed everywhere. I disagree fully. Even here, in askmen, it is not only not against the rules for women to respond, it happens all day every day. Even man bashing comments are fully accepted here. \n\nSo to be clear, you saying that you only want answers from men will not keep women from answering nor do they care at all that you or anyone else might be bothered by it. If I had to guess, I would imagine there are those that would be quite happy at your distress. \n\nSo the singular direct answer is, yes, I often witness/experience sexism against men in 'Feminine Spaces'.",

Anything that is male dominated online seems to become increasingly misogynistic and anything that is female dominanted online seems to become increasingly misandristic. \n\nHow echochambers work with one experience constantly being talked about. Humans tend to focus on their negative experiences more than positive too. So if a male or female dominanted subreddit is a echochamber based on one side of the experience and it's mostly negative experiences being talked about. You get that sort of thing where I guess misogyny/misandry starts to grow. \n\n\n\nIn real life... I work with mostly women and apart from the odd cringe jokes made about men (which to be fair. Men make same cringe jokes about women). I don't experience it but then we are talking about a professional setting where actual sexism isn't tolerated\n\n\nAlso.. This is mostly a online thing to me. I rarely ever meet actual misogynists or misandrists in person.

You learn to not bring up your problems because it immediately becomes how they have it worse, a joke, or an attack on you. A lot of it is just completely casual invalidation of your experiences because it doesn't line up with their worldview, and attempts to say that is seen as being aggressive. Or worse, problematic.\n\nIn high school, a female friend of mine gave a speech in class about how awful men were and how women should run the world. The teacher gave her an A. I also sat down to watch some elementary school kids play a soccer game during lunch alone one day, and the cops were called and I was called a pedophile (I was 15) and threatened with arrest if I didn't leave. I don't think they did the same for women somehow.\n\nIn my first job, the CEO wouldn't hire men in the accounting department because \"Men are naturally thieves\". The HR department knew and didn't care. In my adult professional life, 3/4 companies I worked at had special lunches, meetings, or events for exclusively women.\n\nI went to four recruiting events in my university before I stopped going. All the recruiters were women, the vast majority of the attendees were women. I'm a bit socially slow, so it took one of the recruiter explicitly saying on stage that they'd really like to be a women focused company (this wasn't a small company, you've heard of them) for me to get it.\n\nHonestly, the most alienating part is that I have a lot of female friends, and I don't feel like I can actually talk to any of them about problems I have.

Much of the time its the same, one group gets triggered by another one, builds resentment, and starts triggering another group. Its like enemies recruiting their own enemies. \n\nOne thing that I can add tho, is that specifically when I was in university, there the sexism from women was very much more pronounced and normalized, and any conversation would just be automatically dismissed if it would not be just mindless agreement. Among guys its more prevalent in more degenerate groups. To me its more concerning that a group where people are more \"serious\" are normalizing sexism, while more degenerate groups, will be saying stupid shit. \n\nAnyways, nowadays, the groups of people I hang out with, are cool, accomplished people, with which you can talk about different views and come to understanding of each other. You have to realize that everybody is prone to tripping on something, and if someone is in a deep rabbithole, just accept that its their fight to get through, as their life will suck until they get a reality check. Dont take things personal, just like if a person with psychosis calls you a devil. If you respond with agression, their delusion will only reinforce, all you can do is not entertain their delusion, and hope that maybe the person goes home and thinks over the situation and maybe realizes that they might have been an asshole for no reason to you.

If they want to see misandry, they'll easily find it in low rated comments and posts. If they want to see misandry, they'll interpret a women describing her experience as an attack on themselves and men.\n\nFor me, TwoX is a great place for women to voice their thoughts and issues and vent about shitty things men do. Any hatred I see is usually justified, and many on there go out of their way to say it's their personal experience (aka \"not all men\"). Letting men derail every conversation with \"but what about..\" would not build a community where women can just vent and discuss issues.\n\nI felt more misandry from InfinityNikki subreddit than I have in TwoX. I don't actively participate in either subreddits, but the absolute vitriol men get for trying to say \"Men like this game too! Let's be open about it so that men who are scared to be public about loving such a game feel safer\". The mods blocked those types of posts because of all the drama it created, and I agree the block was the right choice since it was taking away from the general joy of talking about the game itself.

But exactly here is where the problem is, if you are hostile to other group, the effect is going to be that the other group will resent you. \n\nThe country where I am from had, and still has but to lesser extent a division between 2 ethnicities/nationalities. Growing up, you might not have a resentment, initially, but then for no reason, somebody from the other group gives you shit for simply belonging to another group, and you grow up resenting the other group, and you start lashing out at the other group. You become the same asshole which you hated. Its not activism, its not fighting for a your cause, its a delusion in which you are a professional recruiter for your opponents.\n\nOnly when people realize that your neighbours, the people with which you share your society, regardless of which group they belong to, are not going anywhere. You will live with them, whether you like it or not. Question is, will you live in perpetual animosity or will you coexist. Fundamentally, every person just wants to just live a chill life and get along with others. Its when we start tripping on the adverse intentions of the other group, is when we start a vicious cycle of imagining that the other group is my enemy, we treat them as our enemy, and we become more convinced that we were right all along in out paranoia. \n\nFrom my experience, its unbelievably powerful to respond to someone who views you as their enemy, like they were your best buddy and not entertain their delusion that you are their enemy. It might sound stupid at first, but fuck me, it confuses them extremely, as it completely destroys their worldview, as their constructed idea in their minds just stops making sense. \n\nIn a way, a lot of societies are brainwashed that all the revolutions happen via combative approach. Most of the revolutions happen not because the people suddenly mobilize, but because the armies let them. French revolution, the government was broke, armies were not paid, the generals were disillusioned. The voting rights for women, it was not because the protests were so disruptive that the government capitulated, but rather because the large enough society found the idea reasonable. The soviet revolution was because after WW1 the Russian empire was bankrupt and the military was disillusioned. The breakup of USSR, after decades of being told of them being the greatest place on the earth, and as western soap operas, shopping magazines, western media became available to the people, they realized how backwards shithole they were in. The point is, at the crux of the issue is that what made changes happen is that people found the ideas agreeable, not because some people were aggressive enough with pushing their agenda. To make a change, you need to convince people, not just \"fight\".",

Problems a lot of men face like depression are really discussed in a constructive way. An example is the so-called male loneliness epidemic. Men are not lonely because women have the option to stay single but because young men fail to build deep friendships and are afraid to talk about their feelings. \n\nThere is also a notable lack of images of healthy masculinity in popular media.",

I can remember when the first fantastic beasts movie came out and a lot of people criticized the film because Newt Scamander wasn't heroic enough.",
