Have the ability to see her side of things and for her to see your side. You\u2019ll often disagree but it\u2019s the compromise that\u2019s important. One person can\u2019t just win all the time. Be aware. Are you always winning? Can she not get a win ever? Not every topic has to be a war. Not every war has to be won.\n\nYou\u2019re both going to change. You\u2019re going to grow. You each need to love the person for who they are and not what they can provide. They do need to provide their 100%, but not all of us is going to be 100% all the time. Our human battery gets drained from time to time. Becoming their charger is a lesson you need to learn.\n\nTalk. Be each others therapist. Hype them up. Cheer them on. You both are each others coach, therapist, lover, partner, cook, parent, nurse, leader\u2026when they win you both win.\n\nSo find a woman who can talk. That one who looks at you with those big ol\u2019 interested eyes. Nurture that.",

            "body": "What will make a good wife for someone isn't always a one size fits all, but in my opinion, some things should probably be universal. You and your partner should ideally strive to achieve these things together, but you may both need to work together to get there. When both people approach the relationship knowing that the other person is their own individual with their own thoughts, experiences, ways of doing things and accepts those things, the relationship can deal with a lot of common pitfalls, and the relationship will get stronger over time. \nThe other main thing I think leads to a successful marriage is a good, effective, and open communication style. Be open and honest with each other. So many issues can be solved with communication with each other. Yes everyone says \"good communication is key\", but they never tell you what \"good communication\" is. I see people say that they do \"communicate\", but it's not effective. When talking about something with a partner, try and take yourself out of your own head and view things both in the shoes of your partner, and the shoes of a 3rd party. How would my partner respond to what I want to say? Why would they feel that way? Would a 3rd party listening to this conversation have any opinions, comments, or questions for either of us in this conversation? Stuff like that. Genuinely try to remove your own opinions and try and see things from a different view. You are still your own individual, but you and your partner should be a team who both want what's best for each other and the relationship. Sometimes that means you're wrong, and you might recognize that and accept that outcome by viewing the conversation from someone else's point of view. It's not something that's easy to do or comes naturally, but in my experience, it leads to way less arguing, a more collaborative relationship, and a greater understanding for your partner.\nYou usually marry someone for life, so ideally you're both comfortable talking to each other about anything and everything, and enjoying each other's company. You aren't the same human being, so don't think your partner is going to be a carbon copy of you. Find someone you can talk to openly, work with effectively, and genuinely enjoy being around, otherwise you'll have a bad marriage.",

If you can't hang out sober and non-sexual, and enjoy their company don't bother going forward.\n\nIt's a great first filter and mandatory for long-term.\n\nBut 22 years of marriage....does she bring you peace? Does she give you space for your interests? Does she bring positive things to your life.  We have lots of overlap, but the things I suck st she's great and the inverse is true.\n\nIf I want to spend all day reading, playing video games, sleeping, or hang out with my brother she does not care.  I do 90% of the cooking but happily hops in if I'm tired or busy. She doesn't nag when I get home.\n\nIt's cliche but she's my best friend that I also get to do physical things with. Long-term you're looking for a best friend.",
