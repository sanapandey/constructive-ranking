From now on you will mostly see bug fixes and technical tweaks until the start of the next snapshot cycle. As we enter the pre-release phase we will be releasing more frequently than our regular cadence on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release!",

Heres to hoping the next drop actually adds something worth checking out\n\nIdk how you can all be this defensive of a snapshot that adds absolutely nothing of substance to the game other than a few \"Oh thats cool *moves on and never interacts with it ever again*\" features and some halfassed new environmental blocks",
