    "selftext": "I built the BACKROOMS based on wikidot and the game Escape The Backrooms. It is fully playable coded with command blocks with puzzles, keys, exits, items, almond water, entities and so much more without requiring any mods or datapacks.\n\nI've added random darkness effects, cave sounds and specific lighting to make the game more surreal and scary. Tbh I am surprised on how well its going. Currently I've spent more than 120 hrs on this project.\n\nIt is now available for download on my discord",
