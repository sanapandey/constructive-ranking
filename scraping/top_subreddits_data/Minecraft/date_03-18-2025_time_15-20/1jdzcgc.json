People who enjoy Minecraft and aren't techy read this sentence and it's too much for them. You're essentially saying \"all you need to do to play this game is download the game, but then go download this other unofficial thing, and then configure these settings, and then load the game, then you're in!\"\n\n> Literally if it\u2019s just Essential and maybe the obligatory Sodium+Iris it takes, what, 5 minutes at the absolute most?\n\nThis is all unhelpful jargon for someone who just wants to play Minecraft with their friends. Please try to see the other side.\n\nI understand that it can be simple, and I'm sure it's easier now than in the 2010s, but that is not the point I'm making. People simply want things to work without extra configuration, and the Realms approach to multiplayer in Bedrock offers exactly that. Pay a small fee, and boom you have a server that you and everyone on your existing Minecraft/Xbox/Microsoft friends list can join instantly. \n\nThere are different target audiences, and it's ok if Bedrock isn't for you. Similarly, it's ok if modded Java isn't for other people.",

I spent some time playing Java for a while, but all of the servers I joined just sort of fell apart after some time, and eventually I was just playing by myself. I like playing on a Realm that my kids can join and play in too.\n\nI'd say that the biggest thing I miss about Java is how easy it was to make an iron farm. I find Bedrock iron farms too complex (by comparison) and too slow. But with Fortune III and mining out iron veins when I find them? I have enough iron at the moment that I'm not running out.\n\nI sort of wish the introduced the \"scared villager spawns an iron golem\" mechanic to Bedrock though. Even without the iron farm part of it, it's a good mechanic to have in the game IMO.",

I consider myself decent with technology, the first PC I built before we had met, but I had never really figured out how to host a server, even with a multitude of videos on it, it just never worked for me. Realms eliminates that need, and frankly just yes... yes, servers cost money to keep up, so naturally by extension so does Realms. Realms is a solution to the natural problem that server hosting requires a great deal of expertise, Marketplace is an injected solution to the artificially created problems of no open mod support and not being able to just upload custom skins.",

It allows to power some components (pistons, observers and droppers) in a niche way, but is actually immensely useful for compacting\n\nAnother very famous difference is the fact that a one tick pulse on a sticky piston will spit out the block without refracting it. That's one of the reasons how java piston doors are so much faster and smaller in footprint.\n\nA pretty technical one is 0-tick: basically powering and unpowering a piston on the same tick which negates its cooldown. This is how you get insanely fast opening and closing sequences for piston doors, but sees a lot of play in farms that use block stream \n\nJava has access to chunk loaders as well - though it can be argued that this is not exactly just redstone (which is true)\n\nThere are so many examples but these are some popular things that you can do on java and not bedrock\n\nEdit: forgot to mention it but it's not a small feature: observers are a lot more useful on java because they detect a lot more things than on bedrock (shape update being one of them)",

            "body": "I like both but for different reasons. \n\nI originally played on Bedrock when my kid and his dad had started a world (dad on Xbox and kiddo on his iPad) and roped me into play (PC). I had great memories in that world and when I swapped over to Java 5-6 years ago, there were a few things I missed such as:\n\n\n- Lava in cauldrons which we used as a contained garbage without having our house burn (since been added to Java)\n- Bone mealing sugarcane \n- Holding a map in the offhand doesn't disappear when doing certain tasks like rowing a boat or flying. \n- Less grass, making the over world seem much cleaner\n- Being able to easily clear grass with water. Java seems to flow around it most of the time?!? (can you tell I hate naturally generated grass)\n- Performance was much more stable\n- Playing with my family was easy peasy, even without a realm.\n- The simple redstone I attempted made more sense. I still can barely get anything to work without a tutorial in Java. \n- Coords easily displayed without needing a mod\n- Marketplace made it easier for my kid to find and play new maps (though hated the review system or inability to request a return when they just didn't work on the latest version). \n- Easier for my younger son to play via his iPad than a keyboard setup. \n\n\nThe reasons at the time I switched to Java after the family grew bored of our world was due to:\n\n\n- Wanting to try Hypixel Skyblock\n- Being able to crawl without a water source (believe this has since been added to Bedrock)\n- F3 data\n- Vast amounts of community content (mods, resource packs, data packs, tutorials, etc). Thank god for silentwhisperer for tutorials back when I played Bedrock. Funny enough, when I search tutorials now I get more bedrock results. \n- Being able to hold anything in my offhand, especially food or torches. \n- Tons of player hosted servers to choose from (no longer an issue now) \n- Wanted to try my hands at Hardcore (since added to Bedrock)\n\n\nWhile the list of Java pro's lost may seem smaller, their benefits were greater and enough for me to make the switch and haven't played Bedrock since. I do think it's nickname of \"Bugrock\" is a bit much though maybe there are many more bugs since I've played. I felt Java was buggier but not enough to make me switch back. \n\n**Edit:** Some things I remembered liking about Bedrock better was the Creative mode flying. I hate the momentum in Java but downloaded a mod for it. I also liked the louder footsteps sounds so I use a mod for that too. \n\nFun Extra: When I introduced my son to Java, learning the keyboard controls was frustrating for him so I downloaded the map 20 ways to die (or something like that). So instead of constantly dying as he learned the controls, he could take his time while figuring out **how** to die. He's also never gone back.",

As you can see through the years, they are slowly trying to end Java Edition because it provides little-to-no income for them. They said they would never end Java for \"years to come\", but it's been years... Microsoft hopes for Minecraft Bedrock to become a replacement for Java Edition. First, they changed which version was called just \"Minecraft\" on the home menu(Java Edition was initially called just \"Minecraft\"). Then, they combine both games making it impossible to purchase Java Edition without MCBE, but possible to just buy MCBE. Now, they are trying to add bedrock exclusive features so it becomes the superior version. They even have biased and negative splash texts like \"MInecraft Java presents: disgusting bugs!\", Mocking the inefficiency of Java coding language.

The two editions look VERY different because of this, like entirely different games different, almost like China and Developer edition levels of different. Mainly with the exclusive features and new UI with OreUI rework on all the in-game and main menu screens and that's just one example. The poor performance being another big one to where you need mods and clients to fix it, the launchers also bloated but that's more of a both edition problem and MSA/Xbox integration.\n\nI personally don't see why it's a big deal, you can change it back with a resource pack if you don't like it, the vanilla game should try to do new things and the offshoots like minigames or packs build off of that, not the other way around. The good thing about this game is you can change it into whatever you like.\n\nI like Bedrock but its anti creative and creation mindset where it relies on you spending money instead of freedom of expression annoys me the most, mostly because I actually would prefer Bedrock over Java because crossplay and better performance, if it wasn't for the controversial marketplace and them pulling scummy, anti-consumer tactics with dark patterns and no purchase confirmation on Minecoin purchases.\n\nBoth editions have their faults and strengths, I just wish we could have the best of both worlds in 1 edition or game instead of having 2 different games that play differently trying to mimic each other and failing at it as Mojang continues to add parity differences and cant keep up with making more parity.",

It's better for mobile, and while I think the console editions are better than bedrock, it's all the consoles have now, unless you have a disc or PS3/360\n\nJava is imo, the better available option. Yes it has bugs, however I see the bugs legit being used for better QOL. Though it's much laggier. So if your PC isn't too strong, it can just suck up resources. It however has plenty of customization. You can put mods in, resource packs, shaders with different effects, and data packs.

Have been since the start. On java you've also got the ability to play older versions. It started as a PC game inspired by games that only gamedevs and nerds like. Dwarf Fortress is in ascii that's the type of game Notch and the other early devs played.\n\nI mean, nothing against bedrock, but it's selling point was and still is combining all the various (platform) editions.

Still on old combat mechanics, which I love for pvp but not for playing the game normally. The offhand is damn useless. Then whatever it is with the game engine that I just can't figure out. It might be a thing that feels fine on console, but on a pretty good PC bedrock feels off somehow, I swear I'm not just trying to hate on it just to hate. \n\nImo if you're playing a pretty solid pc, Bedrock is objectively worse than Java.  The best thing is that it is the ease of joining friends, which I can get in less than 20 seconds on Java now, but can't get the cross play. \n\n  That does remind me, the store is bloody atrocious, if bits of that ever start coming to Java I'll fr riot, but I doubt they'd do it bc no one would want it.  Once again nice if you're on console ig, better than nothing, but on pc when you can download thousands on thousands of great mods, plug-ins, and resource packs for free. \n\n\nAnyways yeah, Java",
