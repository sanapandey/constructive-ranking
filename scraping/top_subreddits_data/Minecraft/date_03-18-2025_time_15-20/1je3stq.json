You can also put blue waterlogged glass panes to stop it freezing, but that will be slightly visible.\n\nAm I right in thinking you can attach lanterns to the underside of lilypads? That should keep the ice near that area melted.",

Trade a shit ton of emeralds with them to get the local economy going and soon enough capitalism will thrive. Then just wait for the villagers to start massive mining operations in search of emeralds. This will lead to the invention of huge, coal-based drills, emitting tons and tons of CO2. Wait a few years and sooner or later the pollution will start a global warming. Some tipping points later and the ice should start to melt.",
