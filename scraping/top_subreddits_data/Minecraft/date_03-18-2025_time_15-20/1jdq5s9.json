I could be wrong, but I dont think I'm far off.\n\nFor example, the reason I play bedrock is because my kid wanted to play minecraft and I had a PS4 so I got it there for him. But I enjoyed playing it with him so much I started playing it by myself too. And since I started playing on PS4 and spent the first few months playing on PS4 then moved over to PC - I kept playing Bedrock.\n\n> Also the air pocket from placing a door in water isn't an issue or bug, its an intended feature. Logical? No, Bug? Absolutely not.\n\nTo me the logical brist with the door creating an air pocket is a bigger issue than a minor inconvenience causing me to have to relog once or twice a week. I can also fix this issue by going back to where I left all the blocks on the ground so that the bugged blocks in my inventory can update itself properly. That would prevent me from having to relog. But I just relog because its sometimes faster.\n\nThe reason the bug happens is because I create too many entities on the ground in an area that is already performance wise bogged down by multiple farms *while playing on \"ancient\" hardware.\n\nAnd dont get me started on the F3 screen.\n\nI'm honestly not interested in a debate on whats best. I just play bedrock because of the above. I had no idea there even were two versions when I started thinking about minecraft, I only learned that weeks after I had started playing the game. That being said, I've been very satisfied playing Bedrock and dont think it feels buggy at all. I think it actually performs surprisingly well considering its size and what you can do.",

And instead of just syncing them back the client thinks everything is ok (for some reason) but server just plainly goes \"nope nah-nah you stopped sending packets so that's on you, i'll just stop your player momentum but continue to tick you\"",

Also its possible to have ghost blocks damage you, but it's really slow and is fixed by reopening the world (reconnecting to a server). Also I'm not really sure on that, but I think for a couple of versions now ghost blocks damaging you have been fixed and now they just push you out. \n\nI think thats all damage bugs there are. At least those I've heard of",

I remember invisible ghast fireballs (and no ghast animations playing) that could easily lead to death. Arrows interacting with ghost blocks could cause deaths technically speaking although never seen it happen in practice (usually just like a bit of damage since it'd typically only be an arrow or 2). Nothing at all recent I can think of, all of that is like pre 1.4 and iirc some of it was literally in beta. And everything I can think of was exclusively only an issue in multiplayer, never single player.",

I never experience lag as bad as I've experienced on Java in Bedrock but I think it was due to laggy internet so I can understand if you or anyone with this problem in bedrock might be due to Internet lag but I havent tested this",

It works out of the box, in multiple places, and assuming nothing breaks it's fantastically simple. \n\nBut this isn't new.

These are not good things.\n\nKind of like every other example of power without input from those it controls, this is not an altruistic system. It serves the master, not the member. Apple is pointlessly expensive for provably worse products, often adding features years after the competition and generally acting like they made it up. Often their versions of those features are also worse or more limited in some way, usually to avoid risking any instability or having to figure out unsolved problems with the system. And that's just a popular example, there are many. \n\nBedrock is the same thing; ostensibly similar product with removed features that are either monetized, simplified, and re-added, or simply removed or stripped down. When it fails there is often less recourse to solve it, and the ease of use puts you at the whims of the masters' ideas.

Software engineering, digital ethics, and the history of technology are all places I know what the fuck I'm on about. Bedrock, like Apple tech, are very good for children who *shouldn't* have control over their own environment, and people willing to trade their data security, autonomy, and freedom from influence away and get mindless ease of use in return. \n\nI'm sure if I had any reason to reduce my socialization to playing minecraft instead of talking, sharing experiences, and otherwise getting the valuable face-to-face time that prevents abstracting those dear to me, I would enjoy bedrock's mobility. And when I do have people I care about who don't want to spend the time, I generally play on bedrock with them too. This isn't a purist tantrum. \n\nWalled Garden environments have a place. Educational spaces, moderate security systems, children's devices, and devices who's safe failstate is nonfunctionality are all *fantastic* use cases for a walled garden.\n\nSoftware used by adults outside of those spaces, adults ostensibly with problem solving skills and a basic awareness of the machines they trust with information and functions that could ruin their lives if misused (eg payment info, bank account info, sensitive login information, identity information, work security data/information, etc) is not a place for such limitations. \n\nTech literacy has *decayed* over the past few decades, and the primary culprit is walled garden and \"ease of use first\" designs. Young adults not understanding the concept of file folders, being unaware of backups as a concept, failing to troubleshoot issues like a lack of wifi connection... this is stuff we'd almost eradicated in the early 00's that are coming back because of this subtly destructive insistence on people who reject critique by vague excuses of maladjustment or valuelessness in anyone who critiques them. \"Everyone who does better than me is an asshole with no life, anyone who does worse than me is a loser with no skill.\"\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I've got dinner to make so I'll have to get up from my PC here in this basement.

It doesn't happen on bedrock, and it actually completely ruined building for me because it was so effortless and quick to do on bedrock but with the sliding on java it's so clunky and frustrating.\n\nThe second one yeah you got what I mean. It's something I do in creative and survival, always been very satisfying and speeds things up when I'm on survival. It's something about the satisfaction of the process that's just been completely ruined for me, it's probably a feature most people don't even notice. Something about the placing blocks speed compared to the players movement speed being out of sync in java when in bedrock they fit perfectly",

A laptop is not something she's looking at, I think she'd struggle with the controls. My family is poor, they can't even afford food Vs gas and electricity at least once a month. I'm the eldest kid and working plus moved in with my partner so I help my mum out when she needs it.\n\nI agree I love my laptop with all my heart and bring it around with me everywhere. I saved up for it to be a laptop that can run any of my games and allows me to draw. Can't do computers because I need the ability to perch anywhere at any time with my games/art rather than stuck at a desk. \n\nI like steam, I prefer games like stardew, animal crossing, Minecraft, slime rancher, relaxing games where you progress at your own pace. And I love character customisation. I don't see too many games like that on my steam though unfortunately",

On java the timing is off for some reason and the blocks leave gaps, pile on top of each other etc\n\nI also was pretty bummed about the differences in how the maps work, and how the coordinates can't be toggled into the corner of the screen.

Never, and I mean NEVER, in the years that I\u2019ve played on Java OR Bedrock, have I experienced sin to this degree. Whether it\u2019s on a Realm, singleplayer, etc.. No outrageous bugs, or terribly sad deaths like the one you experienced. Nor have any of the eight people I have frequently played with experienced this. The worst case scenario of lag has always boiled down to Realms not being upkept very well, causing latency issues. I\u2019ve fallen through blocks before, but the server has always just placed me back where I was, no damage, no death.\n\nNeither version is perfect, but I don\u2019t think this is a case of such imperfection. Unless this post and top comment are jokes or rage bait, then I\u2019m out of the loop. This looks more like to me your ping skyrocketed for a moment and the server couldn\u2019t track you in time before it started to come back down. Or your system couldn\u2019t process things for a moment for whatever reason and thus a similar result.\n\nI\u2019m truly sorry for your losses though. I\u2019d be pissed too. Rip in peas.",

I head lightning and get shot multiple times. I turn to see 3 skeletons on skeleton horses. I go to run inside my house. I click on the door as I walk inside. I am pushed back outside a few blocks away from my door, which then gave the skeleton a great shot, which he took, and I died.\n\nNow, I only play on creative. I loved watching Youtubers play on hard-core and 1st world. I got done mining in a raven build up to get out as I place the last block to do so I look up at a creeper mid explosion. It blew me up.

I also doubt that most of the bedrock player base posts the bugs, especially on Reddit. So is the frequency of the bug posts here representative of the bedrock population of bugs? I doubt it. But the bugs are undeniably bad enough that they shouldn\u2019t be ignored, and the fact that this sort of thing still happens, common or not, is kind of a slap in the face to anything else the bedrock devs do to improve their side of the game. \n\nI think it doesn\u2019t help the bedrock devs that being able to intentionally replicate bugs like this is quite tricky, but that\u2019s another side of the problem I\u2019m largely unfamiliar with",
