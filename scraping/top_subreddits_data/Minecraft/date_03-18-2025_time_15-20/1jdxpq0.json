The issue is, one of the bosses actually had particle effects around it which have yet to go away on their own and it's been a couples months. I need some help to find any command that can be used to remove the particles and it's effects cuz I'm honestly so tired of it.\n\nTL;DR I need help finding a command to remove these permanent visual effects on the ground that gives a slowness effect",
