    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I took over this project after the framing stage from another builder, and I\u2019ve been trying to ensure everything was done properly. I just noticed that the tie rod holes in my foundation weren\u2019t filled from the inside. The contractor insists they were sealed from the exterior before backfilling, but since it\u2019s already backfilled, I have no way to verify. I\u2019m also a bit skeptical about the concrete work and want to make sure I prevent any future leaks. Since excavation isn\u2019t an option, what\u2019s the best way to address this from the inside? Would hydraulic cement or epoxy injection be enough, or should I take additional measures? Any advice or product recommendations would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

You can do epoxy injection or what not but water is already inside and it will just find another new least resistance path. Water doesn't travel through straight path either so unlikely you can locate the leak from inside.",
