One of the easiest ways to stop this is to engage without engaging.  I worked with a guy that was just odd. He would moan throughout the shift and flutter his tongue, rub his nipples, Deep throat beer bottles, and make VERY suggestive comments. For all intensive purposes he was straight with a girlfriend who was actually kind of hot in a trashy way. Actually He was quite homophobic and hated the Bisexual guy we worked with. He crossed some weird line one day and I just glared at him and said \u201cBart! I can get way better looking gay guys than you\u201d   He chilled out after that. I played his game without playing his game. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s dead now. Which brings me to my last point.  You\u2019ve got a good head on your shoulders the fact that this bugs you and you want a professional means to deal with it will set you up for the inevitable future.
