Do you guys thinks it\u2019s normal to have group chats with homeowners regarding the project where they can text you in the evenings and on weekends? This has become a thing and I find it very intrusive even if I put the text threads on \u2018do not disturb\u2019. I tried pushing keeping this sort of thing in emails only, however my boss doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019m curious if this just comes with the territory of working in Construction\u2026 \n",

I feel you on the group chat creep, it\u2019s brutal when homeowners text at 8 PM on a Sunday. \n\nI\u2019ve been moving to email and one trick I've been using is an email reflector. I use EMail Parrot and it bounces to the group without sharing email addresses or numbers. They email, not text, so you control when you check it and reply. I keeps it pro by setting up the lists on my domain.  Tracks project stuff better than chat threads.",
