How is it looking for y\u2019all? And why is it that this happens? Like I came into this industry young (19, now 23) thinking this where the money resided but I\u2019ve been so disappointed lately and I\u2019m starting to get desperate and thinking of pursing something else, I just wish I could do like 80 hours a week at a great hourly wage, I really do and when the opportunity was there I always took it, but that shit has been so rare, and now it\u2019s looking impossible.

Plumbers, HVAC, electricians. People need water, AC, and electricity.\u00a0",

Most guys I look up to with solid businesses and great teams are crushing it, some with their schedule filled through the end of the year. But some of my friends who are strictly \"word of mouth\" guys are scrounging around for odd jobs currently. Union work seems to be slow from the little info I hear. I have subs who are 3 months out, others in the same trade who can start in 2 weeks. It's a broad mix.\n\nThe general vibe amongst my peers--whatever that's worth--is cautious optimism. We're all expecting great years, but we're also very nervous about the macroeconomic outlook. Trump's erratic game of tariff whack-a-mole and constant threats to annex Canada, coupled with a cooling housing market, a stock market pullback, and relatively unchanged interest rates make for a rather unpredictable future.",
