He was one of the first to adopt one of the new helmet style hard hat which looked ridiculous enough, especially since they were new.  Someone did a sharpie drawing of him with a dick in his mouth blowing out the back of his head through the hardhat.  It was truly a masterpiece.   It looked just like him.  He got so tore up about it he called a meeting to vent.  You can only imagine the grief he got after that.",
