They just tell me to move aside or just take my tools from me to do it for me, even when I protest or say I can do it myself.  Almost always they end up struggling with whatever I struggled with.  Because guess what? I actually am not always the problem!  They also keep looking surprised every time they have a problem with the same thing. \nThis also happens when I\u2019m not struggling at all and am working perfectly fine. They just want to \u201dhelp\u201d constantly \n\nIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m doing a bad job (or at least I don\u2019t think so), because I keep getting feedback that I\u2019m doing well \n\nI am wondering, is this just because I\u2019m new? Will it get better as I get a few years under my belt? (I\u2019m not sure if this is normal with anyone who\u2019s new in construction) \n\nWhat can I do to change things otherwise? I can\u2019t seem to get anyone to hear me out \n\nThey seem to have good intentions behind it, but I want things to change \n\n\nThanks for reading and for any and all advice <3\n",

But also frustrating that they don't seem to be teaching or letting you actually do things.\n\n\nI think guys all have a fucked up mentality when it comes to women at the job site, they usually mean well but there's that underlying systematic sexism they don't realize they have.\n\n\nBut, again - this does sound like how any new worker is treated apart from how \"nice\" they treat you. Think guys usually break that first barrier into friendship by some banter, at least that's my experience. Make a little fun of their work or anything meaningless like how slow they walk to something (if they are the type that can take a joke). This sometimes breaks that first barrier. It can lead to them poking fun at your work, which usually means they feel safe enough to treat you like everyone else. (There's definitely a line here, but trades seem to communicate in this way a lot)\n\n\nThing that really sucks is if you do make a fuss on how you are being treated they'll likely be less willing to try to help / teach. In a weird way our safe space is sometimes where you can just beak each other and not take offense - key to this is not attacking anything they are actually self conscious about.\n\n\nHardest part is it's construction, there are many - many assholes you will have to deal with. And a lot that come off harshly but end up being some of the best teachers. Try not to take anything personal, just be a good worker and anticipate the needs for tasks. If told a job to do, repeat it back how you plan to do it. If you don't have a task, clean up. As a new worker your job right now is basically a helper, anything you can get done without being told is a huge + and it will be noticed.",

Take the opportunity to watch what they do when they step in, they're probably just doing their best to show you how things need to be done.

Keep showing them that you\u2019re capable of getting your work done, and maybe be more insistent on not letting them help so much if it bothers you. Don\u2019t let them take the tools, tell them you\u2019ve got it covered and say it with a little \u201cumph\u201d.

I have seen more typically built women get around their strength disadvantage using intelligence but none ended up staying. But maybe you are a particularity large and strong woman yourself?\n\n\"Almost always they end up struggling with whatever I struggled with.\"\n\nYou mean they struggle just as much and you could have done it yourself? This is a bit odd because men are typically much stronger than women. In studies of twins males, are around 5\" taller and 30 pounds heavier. Even men's lower bodies are stronger despite a common myth otherwise. On average, men tend to have 40\u201360% more upper body strength and 25\u201330% more lower body strength than women.  \n  \nThese guys are trying to be nice and demonstrate that they are some of \"the good men\". This is due to internalized guilt over the past, and a fear of ending up being accused of sexism if they do not make it clear that they are an \"ally\". \n\n  \nIf you do not want help with something just say \"Thanks but I can get it\".",

And I don\u2019t see a problem when they help me with strength related tasks \n \nSome examples \n\na screw isn\u2019t coming undone because it\u2019s possibly bent internally - I want to perhaps use a crowbar, they don\u2019t believe it can\u2019t be unscrewed and struggle with it for like a minute not listening and then take the crowbar themselves \n\nTrying to put in a new wire into a machine and the mechanism that it\u2019s supposed to go into is not working properly - they can\u2019t get the wire in either and just goes to get a new machine \n\na tarp being stuck and the end that is stuck can\u2019t be reached ( when something is stuck they always try to pull it with force which often makes it more stuck or in the tarp example just rips it)  - I want to push the tarp to try and unhook it \n\nDrilling into concrete and it\u2019s not going down - I say there might be a rebar there and want to make a different hole. They try and push the drill really hard into the same spot just to say \u201d there\u2019s a rebar there we should make a new hole\u201d or they just make the new hole after struggling and realising I was right \n\nI will try and be a bit more firm with like \u201dthanks but I got it \u201d",

Once it is verified that even a person with more acquired skill and \"feel\" for things cant get it, THEN it is time to move on. I wouldn't take it personally.\n\nWhen it would happen to me I would feel validated that even the more experienced guy had to resort to another method, and I would sometime learn a new trick.\n\nMost new people encounter more instances where a more experienced person gave something they were struggling with a try and made it look easy, than instances when the more experienced person tried and also had to change tactics. And normally the more experienced person will have a tactic for addressing the problem that a newer person was not aware of. Not sure why this is not the case for you. Maybe you are very smart or working with dumb guys or guys that are not really that much more experienced than yourself, or maybe its just a statistical oddity.",
