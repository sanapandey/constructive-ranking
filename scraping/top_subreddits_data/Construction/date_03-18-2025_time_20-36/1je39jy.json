    "selftext": "So long story short, I\u2019m an apprentice for a non union in Florida (I know don\u2019t get me started\u2026) It\u2019s been a few weeks at this new framing company and I\u2019m learning everyday and applying skills. Going over siding/hardie installations, trimming, leveling, sanding and light fixtures next. So anyways, everyone on the crew is fine honestly, expect one of my foreman\u2019s. No problem personally, but get scolded and mocked heavy when I make an honest mistake or don\u2019t know all the proper terms for things. A few times I took the criticism as light hearted and part of the culture, but overtime it started to affect my mood just trying to work and learn. \n\nThe other day I was having trouble adding another 2x4 or \u201cbeam\u201d on the roof through the tight spaces we were working on and was getting belittled trying to do it. I straight up walked out and told the boss I wanted to submit my hours and dip. My boss is cool I guess because he talked to me for a minute and just said it happens sometimes so I keep pushing\u2026 Nah, it happens again later that day while working on another\u2019s site adding framing for a pool. Was talking crazy to me again and just walked off. Called the boss that day and said just come in tomorrow morning.. Now it\u2019s the morning and I tried calling in sick, but he still wants me to show up with the same foreman for the next few days. I make $18 an hour being an apprentice, while also doing a lot of the strenuous labor. 28M, btw if that gives any context.\n\nAnyways, felt like venting because right now I\u2019m not trying to go in today. Feel mentally exhausted and I\u2019m not trying to be in the same toxic environment all over again. The rest is easy to be honest. Looking for another job, but at the meantime I have some savings if i do decide to leave\u2026 Tired and just feel like resting today",

Telling my foreman he needs to chillout today though. Enjoying the process of building, and rather focus on that. In a few days I should be with a different GC or so. We\u2019ll see how that goes",

The key is to not be a doormat & at the same time be respectful.\n\nSome bosses are just plain assholes & others are extreme assholes go out of their way to make life hard. I know a truly talented knowledgeable construction superintendent who has a shitty way of dealing with people. He\u2019s a bully but if you stand up to him he calms down & can be semi reasonable. When a new subcontract crew is on his job he ramps up the assholery until someone writes \u201cCarl sucks dick\u201d in the portapotty.  Then he backs off a wee bit.\n\nSome bosses are douchebags, they tend to make life a little difficult, but sometimes can be taught a better way. Other times they are incapable of learning.\n\nThen there are the bosses who are true gems. They teach their team properly. They praise in public & if you need dressing down they\u2019ll get you off to the side & explain what you\u2019re doing wrong.\n\nAlways remember Flawdboy that respect is a two way street & has to be earned.",

Is the proper way to handle shit? Absolutely not however as sick as it sounds some\nBlue collar environments can be related to a prison unit environment and my brother what you allow will definitely continue. \n\nI think your to the point now where you just catch him alone and get up real close to him and tell him how you feel and if he says some slick shit rock his goofy ass and keep doing your job. This is probably terrible advice but honestly it\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Or just start blatantly disrespecting the fuck out of him and front of everyone and chumping him off the way he tries to do you and make him understand your with all the bullshit. Once he sees your not playing he\u2019ll get it. I\u2019ve seen dudes literally get ran off job sites I don\u2019t think that\u2019s you though just speaking in general. \n\nOr just leave bro but why should you have to leave because some weak grown ass man feels enabled enough to talk to another grown ass man anyway he wishes because no one else ever checked his bitch ass.

Have already been in physical altercations off the clock, but continuing to be in these environments perpetually is just insane. Also, I resolved everything for the most part and kept it pushing. Being around property managers in rich neighborhoods and fighting it out just sounds stupid and broke. People be having so many issues behind the scenes, whether its drugs, family, or some other stressful shit and bring that energy to work. Call it what it is, but normalizing that energy is trash and it strays away a lot of potentially capable people.\n\nFor the most part everything is fine though. Work pretty well with the crew and show how my skills have been approving. It's just one foreman was tripping early on, and even by mentioning it and calling it out earlier, it kept going... So fuck no, I'm not going to willingly work with someone who's a ticking time bomb. I don't know why that's advocated in the construction community, but its 2025. I don't care if im the only one on the team standing my ground on that. Again, I failed to mention in the original post my part on discussing it early on with my foreman, so I can see how the narrative shifted in me \"not doing anything\".",

It's a company problem where they refuse to address the behaviour of the person because they hold a position of power. In the company I worked for, they just straight up don't have other foremen and are stuck with the assholes. It's come down to two, maybe 3 people that are still willing to work with said asshole. The company needs to give in and do something or accept they can't retain workers and cut their workforce. The other part that may give in eventually is you, you could snap, take too much and go off the deep end or spiral into a depression seeking substances to null the suffering. Get out before that happens. I've seen good men pushed to drink and it ruined their fucking lives. \n\nThis old-school bullying mentality has got to go.

The insults haven't changed he's just not used to getting ripped on for likely doing something kinda dumb. Like he was struggling to get a 2x4 thru the rafters, you know how many apprentices I've seen approach that puzzle in the dumbest ways and get ripped on?",

Have a serious conversation with him and explain in very clear terms that if he doesn\u2019t quit the shit then you two can resolve it off the clock and off the jobsite. He will either get the picture, he will either report you to your boss who is already aware he has been a dickhead and incriminate himself or he will likely not show up for the physical confrontation and then you can tell everyone on the site how he is a massive pussy that runs his mouth but can\u2019t back it up.  But in the off chance he does show up, make sure you can take him and make sure you invite other coworkers that he has been a dick to or that you believe will not let the fight get out of hand. I\u2019m 39, I grew up in the industry as a small kid most of my life till my late 20s and dealt with the dying breed of hardos. Make it clear you are nobody\u2019s whipping boy, even in the off chance he beats you in the fight, if he has any sense he will gain some respect for you and if not than you already know you are moving on\u2026.if everything else is good and it sounds like your boss is decent, handle the dickhead or keep it moving.",
