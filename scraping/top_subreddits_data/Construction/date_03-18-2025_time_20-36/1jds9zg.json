Those bids they put a date for how long they're good for. Every bid I have seen for materials is only a max of 6 months good, average were seeing bids dates being only good for about a month, so they literally wait until the end of the send in date for the bid and just send it all and request you buy it almost immediately or else they have to re evaluate, thats how unstable everything is right now.",
