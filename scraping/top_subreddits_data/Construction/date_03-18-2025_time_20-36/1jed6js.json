    "selftext": "Hello! I am a 30yo Carpenter in NZ, I have been a carpenter for around a decade now and am pretty over it. I have realized that it isn't for me as my body is always sore, the liability of overseeing all build aspects and managing subtrades is stressful, the system for compliance in NZ is messy and inconsistent, and I find my interest and engagement on long projects fading. I also don't like that I have to cart around a van full of tools and need a vehicle that costs the earth to run just because I need to tow heavy materials around daily.\n\nI began study as a draftsman (architectural technologist) however paused study after the first block due to uncertainty that this was what I would actually like to do. I discovered it is heavily focused on legislation and compliance, and less on the design aspect that I wanted to upskill on. I think drafting would be great when I am older and looking to work remotely or work part time for myself, however, I don't know if it is for me now. I ultimately would like to be able to travel with my work, and be out of a physically demanding job. The draw to Drafting was the vision to work from home designing sustainable relocatable homes that perform well. These are important values of mine.\n\nI have wondered about becoming an electrician, the appeals are job variety, higher pay for less responsibility (no being the main contractor), far less large tools required, no towing heavy materials, and shorter jobs. I am very good at working alone, and feel that I would excel as a sole contractor. Thing is, I would be taking a pay cut to retrain and would have to be an employee again. I like the idea of specialising in renewable energy, or finding ways to encourage sustainable energy use.\n\nI'd love to hear any and all thoughts on this, if anyone has perspectives to share that would be amazing.\n\nThanks!",

Then it was a matter of how many jobs were there, and what they paid.  I noped on nursing because it wasn't for me, but that was a process.  I am still astounded that I learned to love it so much and get paid so much more.",

I had a degree in architectural drafting and some experience running wire on sites with the sparkies when I didn\u2019t have anything to do. I applied for a drafting job - in manufacturing - and an electrician job - entry level. Drafting job offered first and before the electrician job called back I was already working. I would have went with the drafting job if I had both offers because it paid more. Been drafting ever since - 2 jobs later. \n\nIn hindsight, if I had to do everything again - I think I would have gone into electrical instead of carpentry. I wouldn\u2019t have liked it as much but would have had a lot more options and made a lot more money. But I would have been making too much money to ever start entry level as a drafter so I don\u2019t think I would have ever gotten that experience. \n\nOverall, I enjoy drafting but if I could wake up and do whatever I wanted, I\u2019d be busy with projects. Nothing against drafting though. I would still do some tinkering in that realm. 40 hrs is just a little more than I want.",

So between that and all the forged documentation, certs don't mean jack shit.\n\nCanada is the only place that will certify you for a trade but not require you actually speak English, or even understand it for that matter. We were asked constantly by our college instructors to try and help our \"struggling classmates\" (30ish year old Indian men who lied about their language skills to get here). Only 1 did, and the guy he was helping flaked out anyway. Half Year later I tried to tell one he was operating heavy machinery wrong (and way too close to where we were working, using a manlift to hang materials) and this dude looked at me funny while getting his buddy to basically tell me he doesn't understand what you said. Essentially, this dumb asshole is a walking hazard around site, the only way to let him know whether he's doing something wrong would be to scream bloody murder at him to make him stop and stare, or get one of his translator buddies. \n\nAnd all this so that we don't have to pay actual Canadians a decent wage. \"Outsourced SKILLED labor\" = \"Indians don't know/care that their making fast food wages while they work 9 dollars below average\"\n\nIn my trade it used to be 24$ (or higher) everywhere starting out, and you had all types of people in it. Especially young students who were genuinely excited to do the work and move up. Now it's 17$ and 95% recently immigrated Indians. Still require the same certs, the same hard work, but now since we have 1 million newcomers that fit 20 of themselves into a 3 bed 1 bath, companies try and force out the old and bring in the new.\n\nIt's ironic that 40-30 years ago you had to go to school to get a degree that would keep you OUT of labor work, office jobs, specialists, things of this nature. Otherwise you ended up working at one of the local factories (like pawpaw!) Now you go to college, pick up as many certs and training as you can just to never hear back from a steel mill or manufacturing company, whether you are just too certified and therefore worth too much, or whether your name just isn't middle eastern enough.",
