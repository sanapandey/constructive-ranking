To prevent this from happening, I encourage people to verify as a professional.\n\nTo do this, take a photo of one of your jobsites  or construction related certifications with your reddit username visible somewhere in the photo. I am open to other suggestions as well; the only requirement is your reddit username in the photo and it has to be something construction-related that a homeowner typically wouldn't have. If its a certification card, please block out any personal identifying information. \n\nPlease upload to an image sharing site and send the link to us through \"Message the Mods.\" Let us know what trade you are so I know what to put in the flair. \n\nLet us know if you have any questions.",

We have a lot of good people giving good advice over there as well as a ton of homeowners who just decide it's a good time to spout out whatever bullshit they want. Half the threads you go into, there are a bunch of mouth breathers saying \"use Teflon on compression fittings\" or \"my local plumber doesn't charge that much, yours should charge less\"\n\nWe had a wave a couple weeks back where one person posted about a toilet with a crack in the porcelain. Lo and behold everyone who had cracked toilets said \"what about mine\" and it got to the point where threads were being made by pros saying \"if your toilet is cracked, replace it. Stop asking if it needs to be replaced, replace it\" for a week all it was, was pictures of cracked toilets even though every answer was \"if it's slightly cracked at all, it needs to be replaced\"\n\nI think r/construction would go downhill quickly if we started letting every homeowner post stuff like \"I paid a handyman $20 an hour and this is what he did, why is it so bad?\"",
