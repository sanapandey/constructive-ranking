    "selftext": "After 25 years I\u2019m switching gears. I\u2019ve been losing bids left and right. People are scared and not wanting to spend money.  In December I had 2 years solid booked out. Now two and half months later I barely have anything on the books. One of my biggest accounts, an apartment builder,  put the next project on a \u201cindeterminant hold.\u201d  That means they have no idea when they will break ground. \n\n\nThe recession is coming and the bubble is about to burst. I\u2019m not going to go the way I did in 2008. Then I did whatever it took to survive. Lost money just to stay working. Now I\u2019ve got way more to lose. This time I saw the writing on the wall and invested some money in the future. My future. I only had 2 employees and I feel bad for them but in tough times you gotta look out for number one. \n\n\nI went and got my class a license and will be driving a truck. A garbage truck. It\u2019s not glamorous by any means but at least it\u2019s recession proof. Protect yourself. Get out now while there are still jobs to be had. Hopefully this all blows over and I\u2019m just being a dumbass, but for now I\u2019m no longer a finish carpenter. I\u2019m sad because the labor I love will no longer be my means of support. ",

            "body": "I have a meeting with the owner of a company, the CEO, and the sales director at 1 p.m. to discuss a salaried position I applied for. I hope I get the job. I\u2019ve been working as a contractor, trying to find enough hours to make ends meet. Wish me luck!\u00a0\n\nUpdate: The interview went well. Two of the upper management expressed interest in hiring someone with more experience, but acknowledged that my positive attitude made up for it. The guy who would be my direct supervisor (I had already interviewed with just him once) wants to give me the job and is on my side. Hopefully he will be able to positively influence their final decision.\u00a0",

His other hangup is that if he stays put, he doesn't want to pivot to do other kinds of work which is also plentiful in the area. \n\nSo I explained to him that there was a time when putting TV antennas on rooftops was a well paying gig. Then eventually cable TV became the norm. Some of those guys became cable installers. Some of them headed out to the mountains to install antennas in areas where cable was not available. But then there were all of the holdouts who went broke and became disgruntled because hardly anyone wanted a TV antenna. \n\nAnd so I congratulate you for getting that CDL. It's the right move until you figure out which direction to take your business.  But I said all of that because I think someone else needs to hear this.  I'm sure there are people in this group who are \"holding out\" and waiting for their industry to come back. And eventually it will. But don't hold your breath. Take action.",

And while we have work, we lost basically those jobs that really sustain a company like ours, and they're not easily replaceable nor easy to speed up another of that size to just rush into. That's how you really sink the ship.\n\nGood thing about houses, everyone has them and they always break. So if you can at least do repair, you probably won't be so bad off. The guys who worked into niche fields and specialized a lot usually get fucking swatted real quick, a furniture maker I knew for example is going under. For reasons not hard for anyone to understand I'm hoping. Either way good luck chums.
