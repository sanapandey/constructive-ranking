He got me into Yoga, and its just...the perfect thing for construction  in general. Learn a few poses, you dont even need to go to any classes, just look them up on youtube, and they can be done pretty much anywhere.",

When the outer muscles along your back get overworked, it can cause issues with the much weaker muscles along the inside of your spine. This leads to spams and pain and things not staying where it\u2019s supposed to. \n\nMany yoga exercises build a balanced spine which is what you\u2019re aiming for.

If you're bending at the waist too much, you'll lose the hip contact.\n\nI got this from the strength and conditioning coach for the Orioles about 7 years ago (in relation to squat and deadlift form) and found there's a physical therapy device sold for it that is very expensive compared to a broom handle.",
