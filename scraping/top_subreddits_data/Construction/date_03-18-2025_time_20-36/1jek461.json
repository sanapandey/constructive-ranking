They\u2019re light and I like the pocket configuration, I also enjoy having 7 belt loops and the back one is really wide. \n\nThey make 3 different thicknesses for different weather. The winter ones are warm as shit, I can\u2019t wear them unless it\u2019s like 15 degrees out. The regular ones are pretty light and comfortable in most weather and the really lightweight ones are good for really hot days. \n\nThe thing I dislike most about them, they\u2019re noisy. They sound like a wind breaker type of material when it moves. You can hear me before you see me.",
