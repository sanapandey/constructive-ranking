It was a particular group of people we had this issue with, and instead of getting and using the free deodorant 3 of them openly complained about it being discrimination in the workplace, that it was unfair (literally free hygiene, also totally fair to make me smell your 4 days of caked on BO).\n\nManagement folded. Management had pretty much the entire warehouse at this meeting, they did not say who it was, they told EVERYONE so it wasn't discrimination, that deodorant is needed and will be provided, and these guys fought to be smelly. And in that, anyone who didn't already know it was them now did. Now it's a confirmed stereotype for me, it's not racist because it's been true pretty much wherever I go. You could say it's rude, however if you don't smell then you have nothing to worry about. If you do, worry about wearing deodorant",
