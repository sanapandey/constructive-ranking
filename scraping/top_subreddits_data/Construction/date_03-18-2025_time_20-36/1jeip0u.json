    "selftext": "I just finished my first year of plumbing apprenticeship (I'm 18), but I've been off and on working in the industry for a couple years prior. \n\nI'm just constantly tired now, at work, at home, and when I'm out on weekends. I eat ok, not perfect, but ok, I drink lots of water, I don't smoke or vape, and I rarely drink. There's been a few times where people have tried talking to me at lunch or whatever and I just don't notice until they nudge me or something like that. I don't have much downtime usually (which is nice, I like being productiv, it's less boring), always something to be moved or delivered or whatnot.\n\nI've been bounced around sites a few times, but right now mine is over an hour out from home, I'm up at 3 in the morning and am not home until usually 6 in the evening. I don't usually last past an hour or so after I get home before passing out somewhere. The other day I almost passed out on the highway when I got honked at as I was drifting onto the shoulder lane.\n\nWhat do you guys do, cause I know there is no way I'm the only person who is like this.\n\n",
