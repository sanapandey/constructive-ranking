    "selftext": "I think a good way to demonstrate this is by taking a look at her case vs. the case of China P. Arnold. [Here's what they both comparatively look like.](https://i.redd.it/vct8clszhepe1.jpeg)\n\nOn May 13, 2011, a jury of 12 unanimously found [China P. Arnold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_P._Arnold) guilty of microwaving her baby to death. She's serving life without parole.\n\nTwo months later, on July 5, a jury of 12 unanimously found [Casey Anthony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Caylee_Anthony) not guilty of killing her child. This is a woman who waited 31 days to report her own missing child. Even the judge in her case later [said](https://www.tiktok.com/@teaandtruecrimewithbella/video/7284715121207692590) he thought she was guilty.\n\nJuror #3, Jennifer Ford, [claimed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/casey-anthony-jurors-explain-their-thinking/) there was a lack of evidence. She did acknowledge, however, that Casey's behavior in the weeks after her daughter went missing, including partying, \"looked very bad...but bad behavior is not enough to prove a crime.\"\n\nPeople are still mystified by how Casey got away with it, including a one-hour documentary called \"[There's Something About Casey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJt_afGN3IQ)\" which I recommend, but to me it's glaringly obvous that if Casey had looked like China P. Arnold, she would be serving life without parole right now, not posting on TikTok which she's currently doing.\n\nI know some might argue that looks had nothing to do with it, but I simply don't believe \"a jury of 12 peers\" makes any sense in a world where hundreds of studies have proven that attractiveness affects people's judgement of you.",

            "body": "Have you seriously considered any alternative explanations for the different outcomes in the trials? I ask because the two cases don't seem especially similar. \n\nIn the case of Arnold, there was clear physical evidence of the murder. Her defence couldn't seem to settle on an alternative narrative. They couldn't decide whether her boyfriend, a potential witness/alternative suspect, was present at the time of the murder or not. The most sympathetic account they offered seems to have bordered on complicity in the murder. The prosecution had a witness who claimed that Arnold had confessed to her.\n\nBy contrast, the evidence against Anthony was circumstantial. Her defence was able to contest any direct evidence of murder. They picked an alternative narrative and stood by it. It was never disproven. \n\nTo be clear, I am surprised that Anthony wasn't convicted. The circumstantial evidence seems pretty damning. But it seems like we could just be looking at a trial with less evidence and a more competent defence.\n\nAlso, looking at the pictures you linked to and reflecting on the uneven application of criminal justice, what immediately leaps to my mind isn't 'Hot or Not'. It's 'black and white'. If you're really set on the idea that there different outcomes were caused by the jury being swayed by superficial factors, surely race would be a strong contender.",

If we compared hundreds of similar cases and assessed the perpetrator based on prettiness, there's a good chance we'd find a statistically significant degree of bias towards prettiness, however we'd still see the \"ugly\" people being found guilty just in smaller amounts: So if with equivalent cases ugly people got found not guilty 20% of the time and pretty people got found not guilty 30% of the time after controlling for all other factors, that 10% difference would be the prettiness bias.\n\nBut that doesn't help us in individual cases because there's no way to tell if this is one of the 10% that got found innocent because of prettiness or the 20% that would have been found innocent anyway.\n\nIt then gets much harder when you factor in all the random variables it's hard to control. Each jury is different. Each prosecution is different. Each defence attorney is different. Hell, each defendant themselves is different and their testimony and how they give it will have an impact.\n\nThis isn't even bringing up race as a factor. You assume it is pretty privilege, but what about the possibility of white privilege?\n\nCould there be a prettiness factor at play? Certainly yes. Can you prove it? No. Are there lots of other factors that could also have contributed to a decision one way or another? Yes.",

The average person is way too biased, but you can't \"prove\" it unless they  explicitly say it, which they rarely do. It's the same concept regarding your white privilege argument. Who on a jury is going to admit they have racial bias?",

The flaws with the jury system also aren't the same thing as pretty privilege. If she got off because she happened to pull a more forgiving, cautious and/or gullible set of jurors, then while you can say that this is a problem with the jury system it's not a problem that's inherently linked to pretty privilege or shows pretty privilege was a factor here.\n\nNo-one will admit they have bias and many people won't be aware of their biases.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you can inherently know that prettiness bias is the reason that Casey Anthony was found not guilty. There are lots of other factors at play that could explain the outcome, as mentioned in my previous post - and even if prettiness bias is a factor here we don't know that it was a deciding factor and she wouldn't have been found not guilty anyway due to having a better lawyer, white privilege, happening to pull a more forgiving jury, etc.",

There wasn't any hard evidence she did it, so she was found innocent. There's a lot of *suspicious* stuff, but you can't and shouldn't be able to send to jail for child murder for being kinda sus. You need actual proof that she killed her daughter, and the prosecution simply didn't have that. \n\nI think this is the mix-up people have with the Casey Andrews case - almost everything people point to as hard evidence is simply not legal evidence. Waiting a long time to call in a missing persons result isn't proof of murder. Googling chloroform a lot isn't proof of murder. Someone saying your car smelt bad isn't proof of murder. There was never any evidence she killed her daughter, just a lot of hearsay, so she didn't get convicted of killing her daughter.",

There is a public perception that such evidence is weak (\"all they have is circumstantial evidence\"), but the probable conclusion from the circumstances may be so strong that there can be little doubt as to a vital fact (\"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in a criminal case, and \"a preponderance of the evidence\" in a civil case). Particularly in criminal cases, \"eyewitness\" (\"I saw Frankie shoot Johnny\") type evidence is often lacking and may be unreliable, so circumstantial evidence becomes essential. Prior threats to the victim, fingerprints found at the scene of the crime, ownership of the murder weapon, and the accused being seen in the neighborhood, certainly point to the suspect as being the killer, but each bit of evidence is circumstantial.\nhttps://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=191\n\n\n\n\n\n>Circumstantial evidence does not provide an immediate answer to the question of whether a fact of consequence exists. 2 Evidence is circumstantially relevant \u201cif it can serve as a step in a reasoning process that leads to establishing the existence or nonexistence of the ultimate fact of consequence.\u201d3 With circumstantial evidence, even if the sponsoring witness is believed, the jury must still decide whether to draw one or more inferences before concluding that a fact of consequence exists. 4 DNA is circumstantial evidence. Because of this fact, it is critically important to closely examine the pre-analytical evidentiary context of all items, articles, or substances collected by crime scene investigators. Only by seeking to test items with a substantial degree of pre-analytical contextual significance can prosecutors narrow the range of reasonable inferences available from a detected profile.When conducting this inquiry, a prosecutor should ask himself or herself: Does the item, article, or substance\u2014considering its contextual constellation\u2014tell a story that would limit the scope of reasonable explanations available to rebut an incriminating profile?    \nhttps://ndaa.org/wp-content/uploads/Oct-Nov-Dec13_DNA_guidelines_Pros.pdf",

If you leave that unanswered the evidence is useless.\n\nSo like... it's physical evidence, and direct evidence of something, with bolstering circumstantial evidence that would be fairly useless without the link that goes in one direction?  All of which add up to something? The ultimate issue?

Circumstantial evidence is often extremely powerful. Here is the example that is often given in court. You go to sleep at night and there is no snow on the ground. You wake up and there is lots of snow on the ground. You didn't see it snow (direct evidence) but based on the circumstances and your knowledge of the world, you know that it snowed. The snow on the ground is circumstantial evidence that it snowed last night.*\n\nhttps://answers.justia.com/question/2019/07/22/what-is-the-concept-of-overwhelming-circ-704715\n\n\n*Though the distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence is widely accepted, the common law does not discriminate between the two in terms of their weight. A criminal conviction may rely solely upon circumstantial evidence.*\n\nhttps://repository.uclawsf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=judgesbook\n\n\n\n\n*The authorities are legion that circumstantial evidence can be every bit as compelling as direct evidence. See, e.g., Rogers v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 508 n. 17, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957) (citing The Robert Edwards, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 187, 190, 5 L.Ed. 238 (1821))*\n\n*(\u201cCircumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also be more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.\u201d); \u2009United States v.

Your opinion do not change the facts: circumstantial evidence is not valued less than direct evidence.\n\n\n\n>The adequacy of circumstantial evidence also extends beyond civil cases; we have never questioned the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence in support of a criminal conviction, even though proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required. See Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121, 140 (1954) (observing that, in criminal cases, circumstantial evidence is \"intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence\"). And juries are routinely instructed that \"[t]he law makes no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence.\" 1A K. O'Malley, J. Grenig, & W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Criminal \u00a7 12.04 (5th ed. 2000); see also 4 L. Sand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin, S. Reiss, & \u039d. Batterman, Modern Federal Jury Instructions ~ 74.01 (2002) (model instruction 74-2). It is not surprising, therefore, that neither petitioner nor its amici curiae can point to any other circumstance in which we have restricted a litigant to the presentation of direct evidence absent some affirmative directive in a statute.

A hair in a trunk could have gotten there a million different ways. There was a hair stuck in a toy that you threw in the trunk, and the hair ended up in the trunk.\n\nIf there are 12 people in a jury, and a few of them are undecided, and a couple are in favor of guilt to begin with and a couple are in favor of not guilty to begin with, sometimes it's just a matter of the makeup of the jury, and which people in that room are going to be the most persuasive. \n\nJust like in the courtroom itself, sometimes one lawyer is more persuasive, not because the facts on one side are stronger than the other, but certain lawyers are better at getting their point across to the jury. \n\nThe issue with watching documentaries, is that oftentimes you take a weeks-long trial, and it is shortened down to an hour or two or eight. You or I watching that documentary, don't see the trial the same way the jury did. We don't see the entirety of each lawyer's arguments. Did he go on for too long, and even though he was saying some important things, half the people on the jury just lost interest?  Did he explain it that was too complex for the jury to understand? Or maybe too oversimplified to the point that it didn't sound intelligent enough, or scientific enough? \n\nWhen each side has a forensics expert, and they are already doing opposing points, sometimes a jury might view, bringing in the expert from New York City as being even more of an expert, because they're from the big city. Sometimes a jury might view that same type of situation as bringing in someone from across the country, is just the defense paying an expert for their testimony, they'd probably say anything for the paycheck. \n\nDo I think Casey Anthony was involved in her daughter's death? Yes. \n\nDo I think it's reasonably possible, that she was not involved in her daughter's death, but found out about it, and out of fear for her own safety didn't say anything about it for a while? Yes, I think that's a possibility too. \n\nI wasn't on that jury, so I didn't see the ins and outs of everything that was presented to them, in the order and manner in which it was presented, like they did. However, I can understand the outcome. \n\nCasey, Anthony was found not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Which doesn't mean she's innocent, nor does it mean she's not guilty. It just means a jury. Couldn't say that she was guilty beyond A reasonable doubt.",

                            "body": "If there is a lack of reasonable doubt that the person is not guilty, that would be called a guilty verdict. The burden is on the state to prove guilt, a person is innocent until proven guilty. So the defense doesn't need to prove the person is not guilty, or innocent. If there is no evidence of Innocence, that is completely fine. The prosecution needs to prove guilt. if the person is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury should not find that person guilty.\n\nGenerally speaking, what I think you're talking about happens before the trial. Police cannot arrest someone without some level of evidence. A DA can't charge someone without some level of evidence. I'm not saying the legal system always works as it should, but a judge can and should throw out a case if there is only very flimsy evidence. So without any real evidence, that case should not make it to trial for the jury to just go off of vibes. \n\nThat being said, the jury can take into consideration anything that occurs at the trial in front of them, that the judge didn't specifically tell them to not take into account. They can say the DA's bright green tie on Tuesday made me think I shouldn't trust him. However, hopefully another juror points out that the color of someone's tie has nothing to do with whether or not you should trust them.",

But the general public tends to believe in them - so the news will run stories about the defendant refusing to take one, and the public therefore wrongly assumes guilt. \n\nAnother big category of impermissible evidence if \"character evidence\" - things that really only speak to whether a juror might think the defendant is a good person, and not to whether they actually committed the crime in question. \n\nOr evidence that might have *some* limited probative value, but which is so ridiculously unfairly prejudicial to the defendant that it can't fairly be presented.

I don't think a juror would be stupid enough to say something like that out loud.\n\nYou say this as if everyone wanted to serve on a jury. They're forbidden from forming their opinion on a crime the way everyone else does; TV coverage and social media; and have to sit in a boring court room and hear expert witnesses go over the tedious details of a case.\n\n  \nEven if a part of them felt obliged to do their civic duty, they could still subconsciously want to get out of it badly enough that they don't feel particularly motivated to conceal their biases.\n\n  \nCivic juries were a mistake. Cases should be judged by judges, period.",

                    "body": "Here's a hypothesis or alternative explanation that I have which relates to  how humans in general project their own understanding of reality  onto actual reality and try to warp the latter to fit the former rather than absorb and interpret reality as it is.  This is straight from how the simplified information model of environment processing in the human brain works.\n\nIn that hypothesis the natural assumption is that all these jurors were really sub-consciously projecting *themselves* into a similar situation since Anthony was white like majority of jurors. Hence they defended Anthony because they wanted (and expected under precedent) to be treated with similar standard for evidence.\n\nOn the other hand wit Arnold it would be a similar projection, except that with a black woman the \"other\" would be projected onto Arnold rather than \"self\" leading to the opposite conclusion: self must be protected, threat from other must be eliminated.\n\nAnd if there were black jurors in the jury then they simply knew she was guilty and wanted to get rid of a pest - Blacks in America don't view the justice system in the same way as whites do so their expectation of fair trial is minimal.\n\nIn short the explanation rests on a different typ of unconscious bias that most sociologists and political activists point to. It wasn't a racial bias but a self/other bias that occurs spontaneously based on very simple characteristics: if I can identify with someone it's \"self \" by default vs if I can't identify with someone it's \"other\" by default.\n\nNow the above process actually does exist for some other aspects of perception and communication but I haven't seen any study for how juries decide cases. I don't expect it to be any different. The brain works the same. It's just a monkey brain with extra neurons.",

The jurors in Arnold's case were acting with an \"other\" bias and thus focused on elimination of perceived threat.\n\nEthnic makeup is irrelevant. It's entirely down to how the jurors, or a significant majority of them, relate to the defendant.  \n\nAnd I thought of this explanation specifically because of your comment pointing to the attorney's strategy.

The jurors all spoke about how the attorney's behavior was scrutinized. \n\nIf you think about the modes of persuasion: ethos, pathos, and logos, we all forget that the attorney's demeanor does make a difference for the ethos and pathos forms of persuasion. As much as you want to hyper focus on logos, it still makes a difference on how information is framed. \n\nWhat's interesting is the way deliberations happen. They do a straw poll - so when it's 12-0 for lying to the police, don't need to talk about it. So they keep doing straw polls for each charge. The aggravated manslaughter was 6-6. After they deliberated, the vote changed 11-1 to acquit. \n\nWhen you have consensus based decision-making, no one data point can be conclusive. Because not every person will have the same rating of attractiveness, little alone weighing the impact of attractiveness (i.e., that attractive people can evade consequences). \n\nThe other thing about jurors. Like you, many people have assumptions about what it's like to serve on a jury. We have jokes that juries are people too dumb to get out of jury duty. But there's something about being in the chair where the seriousness and civic duty kicks in. Jurors take their jobs seriously. They get ample instruction from the judge. They take the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard seriously. \n\nIn fact, it's why the Casey Anthony jurors report being sick to their stomaches about the consequences of their verdict. They followed the process. They're not outcome determinative. \n\nWhat it came down to is the state could never prove HOW the kid died, little alone WHO caused the death.",

Her defense said that the kid drowned in the pool. That's basically a confession to abuse of a corpse, child neglect, maybe even manslaughter. Perhaps you might even believe that she drugged the kid so she could go out an party, but accidently drugged the kid too much and she died. None of that really supports murder with premeditation.
