    "selftext": "I was gonna vote liberal anyways, but recently I see a sentiment online that I strongly disagree with.\n\n\u201cAxe the carbon tax\u201dhad been what the Conservative Party had been campaigning on for quite a while, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, a pretty popular policy too. After Mark Carney announced that he will be removing the carbon tax, aka doing exactly what the conservatives had proposed to do and criticized the liberals for not doing, people started acting like \u201cliberals DESTROYED conservatives\u201d and \u201cconservatives will lose their minds\u201d.\n\nI disagree. Doing the best for the country and changing policies to fit what the citizens need is always what the politicians should do. If the conservatives proposed a change that\u2019s popular, and the liberals adopted it: great! That\u2019s a good platform for the two parties to collaborate on or at least see eye to eye on.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. People are acting like their tribe successfully infiltrated an enemy tribe and stole their tribal treasure with no repercussions.\n\nIf there\u2019s any negative feelings about this situation, it can only be, \u201coh, liberals had no choice but to shift a bit more to the right to try and gather more voters. Let\u2019s hope they will actually be more popular than before, unlike what happened to our neighbour down south\u201d. Not \u201cha, the conservatives are utterly disabled and useless after we took over their most popular policy!\u201d\n\nTo summarize: I don\u2019t think the Canada liberals adopting the widely popular anti-carbon tax stance of the conservatives is, or should be, a \u201cconservatives get owned\u201d moment.",

And he's using the corporate carbon tax to invest in carbon capture and green infrastructure. None of this is what the conservatives want. So he's not adopting a conservative policy at all. \nRead his actual platform here: \n\nhttps://markcarney.ca/media/2025/01/mark-carney-presents-plan-for-change-on-consumer-carbon-tax",

Yeah, but that's sort of the point. Make polluting things slightly more expensive to encourage less polluting things. Use the generated money for cleaning up the pollution. It also pushes companies to do less polluting things because it will make their margins better. Try to leave our kids with something.\n\n\nIf you want to attack it I would go after the whole double bureaucracy of it. The government spends a ton of money subsidizing fossil fuels to make them cheap just to turn around and add fees to make it more expensive. Why not just lower the subsidies. But then we get back to the whole trade thing. This seems to be what Countries decided to do.",

The carbon tax is deeply unpopular in Canada and had become a rallying call for those dissatisfied with the Liberal party and had become synonymous with the the affordability issues the average Canadian is facing and general dissatisfaction with the economy. It was the core of the conservative platform, it was their 3 second sound bite that they could repeat again and again.\n\nThe issues of affordability and economy still exist, but the conservatives have lost their soundbite. Additionally, Carney has a brand of being the 'economy' guy, so the conservatives lose a bit on that argument as well.

They used every tool they could: nakedly corrupt provincial governments launched EXPENSIVE lawsuits against the Feds over the carbon tax. Privately/Foreign-owned Postmedia news companies have published anti-carbon tax op-Ed\u2019s for ten years. And other strategies, like funding the Freedom Convoy and strikebreaking activities in Alberta and Saskatchewan. What does all this mean? Well, If the carbon tax was truly unpopular, the conservatives would have won in 2015, 2019, and 2021. They didn\u2019t. They spent an enormous amount of political energy to fight the carbon tax AND STILL COULDNT WIN.\n\nThe carbon tax was and is NOT unpopular. The key popular piece of the carbon tax is the Carbon Rebate: it\u2019s the major reason for what makes the carbon tax policy palatable to the 60-70% of Canadians who don\u2019t vote for the Federal Conservatives.\n\nThe business wing of the Liberal Party just won the leadership race. These people ideologically sit in between Liberals and Progressive Conservatives (the defunct precursor to the Conservative Party). Christia Freeland resigned as finance minister because of fiscal policy disagreements, and she subtly derided wealth redistribution policies pushed by Trudeau. The Liberals aren\u2019t actually capitulating to *popular support* here: they\u2019re capitulating to wealthy resource extraction companies and their investors.",

It has swung left in the last decade with policies such as the carbon tax, legalized weed, loose immigration policies, massive spending on \"social infrastructure\" leading to running deficits. \n\nTimes has change and now when the country finally runs out of money and doing poorly, it move back to the right by eliminating Carbon Taxes, lowering immigration, and they signal this move by having Justin Trudeau resign and put in a banker - Mark Carney, in its place as the next party leader. \n\nThe liberals has been copying the other party's policies and double down as if it was their own. It was done a decade ago because legalized weed and immigration was pretty much the Left's space which was occupied by the NDP and they out NDP-ed the NDP. It's now the same where they copied the Conservative's Policies to \"axe the tax\" and focus on fiscal policies by trying to get close to the EU. In short, they've abandoned their own left leaning followers and the policies they've established for the last decade and move right, which is literally \"owning\".\n\n\"Doing the best for the country and changing policies to fit what the citizens need is always what the politicians should do.\"... but the Liberals haven't been doing that for the last few years. Flooding their own country with immigrants (and solo a large percentage from one solo country) can't be good for the country. Continually running large deficits can't be good for their own country. Letting Criminals run rampant with guns while having nonsensical gun restriction on legal gun owners isn't good for their own country. Paying a contractor 54 million to develop a mobile app where the president of that app developer ended up being an staffer for the government isn't certain \"for the good of that country\".\n\nMy biggest gripe here is that the Liberal party of Canada's swaying to the right  is that it's not so much as \"for the good of the country\" but just a bid and lips service to stay in power. Mark Carney was caught on a hot mic saying he'll reinstate the carbon tax as soon as he's elected. Another problem here is that these populist party lacks long term planning. Canada would have been in a much better position right now if some of these very same policies they've implemented weren't there, and now they are just preying on people's short term memories and undoing polices at they themselves has put into place. A lot of people didn't realized that those right leaning policies are \"popular\" are because things have gotten really bad, and it's bad because of all those left leaning polices that was in place for the last decade.\n\nA government that only spend in good times and only started cutting when times are bad isn't a good government to begin with. A government that campaigned on back-tracking their own policies are just an admittance that they've screwed up and therefore isn't a good government.",

This would have to be either beefing up the other carbon tax or some kind of regulatory approach, which don't align with what I'm hearing from Conservatives.
