But every time I see an owner being rude and defensive in a response I get the ick.\n\nIf I see the owner reaching out to speak to the person privately, I feel like they\u2019re doing their due diligence. But the minute they \u201cclap back\u201d or go on a rant I think I\u2019ll never go there.",

We thought staying late and serving you was the right thing to do but in hindsight we likely should have seen that we'd not be able to give you a positive group dining experience with that timing, we have some staff that need to get home to their families and the staff that were able to stay late weren't sufficient to meet your expectations\" tells me the group was likely more at fault than restaurant \n\n  \n\"oh yeah, well our pizza is awesome and if you don't like it go somewhere else!\" generally doesn't do the business any favors",

I saw one crazy entitled, vitriolic bad review for a restaurant a while back and the response was basically saying how awful the customer was and to go check their review history. Sure enough they are one of those people who is never satisfied anywhere. They had like 500+ reviews and they were all the same vibe as the first. Needless to say I went there for dinner and it was a great meal.",

I don't want to see what some restaurant owner's critique of my eating habits and ordering style looks like on the internet for as long as the review site lasts. Often owners/managers like that are bullies and will go after very mild negative reviews because they're mild and signal the reviewer doesn't want a fight.",

People would even go in and practically dare them to perform bad service so they could leave a review,  and get a response. I think I may even seen something about it here on Reddit. It was wild. I also think it brought them a lot of business. \n \nThen, at some point the owner took on a partner so he could expand the place, and the fights ended. All the bad responses were scrubbed, changed to a generic \u201cwe\u201dre sorry you had a bad experience.\u201d And that was when the place lost its soul. They\u2019re still in business, but in a blandified corporatized version. Oh, their product is more consistent, and the service is better. But it\u2019s just boring now.",

            "body": "There's a different between arguing with a bad review and providing context for that bad review.  I started my career answering phones in a call center for a national restaurant chain in the US.  I can say, from experience, a lot of the people that leave shitty reviews were either originally in the wrong, had unrealistic expectations or some combination of both.  I agree that clapping back and pointing blame in a bad review response is bad form for a business, even if it was 100% the fault of the customer.  Depending on how shitty the response is, that could sway me to not do business with them, not because I believe the reviewer but because I wouldn't want to deal with someone like that if I do happen to have a problem.  But if the response is calmly and respectfully providing context and the other side of the story for anyone that may be reading the review, I feel it's good customer service being provided for any future customer.  Also, if a business is checking up on the reviews then it shows they do care and take feedback into consideration.  This is especially true if they're not only providing context to bad reviews but also thanking customers for good reviews and, in the case of some bad reviews, don't provide any context at all.  Just a \"thank you for your feedback, we'll work on this in the future\".  \n\nIt just depends on the pattern of the responses, I suppose.  If they're genuine throughout then that gives me a more positive feeling for the business.  It's better than them just keeping silent.  If they're often defensive or deflecting blame back to the customer, even if written eloquently, I'll pick up on that and probably find someone/somewhere else to take my business.",
