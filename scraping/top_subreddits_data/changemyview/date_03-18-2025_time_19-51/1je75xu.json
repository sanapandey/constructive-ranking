    "selftext": "From 1942 to 1945, the Code Talkers were key to every major operation of the Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater. The Code Talkers were Indigenous Americans who used codes based in their native languages to transmit messages that the Axis Powers never cracked. The Army recognized the ability of tribal members to send coded language in World War I and realized the codes could not be easily interpreted in part because many Indigenous languages had never been written down.\n\nThe Army expanded the use of Code Talkers in World War II, using members of 34 different tribes in the program. Indigenous Americans always enlisted in the military in higher proportions than any other demographic group\u2014in World War II, more than a third of able-bodied Indigenous men between 19 and 50 joined the service\u2014and the participation of the Code Talkers was key to the invasion of Iwo Jima, for example, when they sent more than 800 messages without error.\n\n\u201cWere it not for the Navajos,\u201d Major Howard Connor said, \u201cthe Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.\u201d\n\nYesterday, Erin Alberty of Axios reported that at least ten articles about the Code Talkers have disappeared from U.S. military websites. Broken URLs are now labeled \u201cDEI,\u201d an abbreviation for \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\u201d\n\nThe idea that these people were \"dei hires\" is simply false. There is no justification for this. It is plainly racist but saying so will be certian to trigger many if not most right wingers.\n\nCalling it racist is a bigger problem than the racism. That was the whole point.\n\nI'll try to head off the number one response I'll probably get to this: \"But everyting **was** called racist.\" This is false as a matter of record. I'll concede probably more rotten behavior was attributed to racism than what fit the definition but a lot of rotten behavior wasn't, right-wing entertainers simply filtered out the latter category to produce the title narrative - and anyway it doesn't excuse the rotten behavior.",

            "body": ">Cmv: conservatives spent the last 4 decades marinating in grievances about everything being called racist to train their audience to get defensive when racism is called racist\n\nI think it's easy to treat conservatives in the US as a single unified block, especially given how quick they are to get in line and support whatever their party does.  \n\nHowever, I think this is a pretty uncharitable way of looking at it.  Don't get me wrong - the people you describe do exist - actual racists who don't like being called out for their actual racism.  But there also exist many conservatives who are truly not racist, hateful people, and who bristle at the accusation.\n\n\"But...\", I hear you saying, \"if they're not racist why do they support all of the racist stuff the Republican party does?\"  Well, the simple answer is that they do not BELIEVE that the things the GOP is doing are motivated by racism.  Many people have been brainwashed into believing that \"DEI\" is the same as \"affirmative action\", which is the same as \"reverse racism\" - or in other words, they believe that any diversity efforts intended to lift up minority groups are de facto discriminating against majority groups.  \n\nNow, mind you, I'm not saying that they're RIGHT, or that I agree with them.  But I think it's very easy for people who don't have any conservatives in their life (or the only conservatives they know are crazy ass Trumpers) to dismiss them as all hateful people.  When in reality, I think a large number of run-of-the-mill conservatives are just taking what they believe is a neutral, reasonable stance to the narrative they've been fed.  \n\nLet's be honest here - the average rural conservative American doesn't have a very deep understanding of the nature of oppression in society.  Their idea of what a \"racist\" looks like is very narrow - it's Hitler and the KKK.  It's people who describe others using racial slurs.  And it's Neo-Nazis that truly believe that white people are the master race.  To them \"racist\" means outright saying \"I think black people are inferior degenerates\", and anything less than that doesn't fit the term.  They don't really understand some of the more nuanced concepts that get discussed in more academic circles - the idea of \"privilege\".  The concepts of institutional racism or systematic oppression.  \n\nSo we have a big difference in our definitional understanding of what \"racist\" means.  To one side, it means Hitler and the KKK.  Pro-slavery and outright antisemitism.  And to the other side, something as simple as \"being part of the majority group and benefiting from centuries-old racist policies that still have downstream effects to this day\".  \n\nIn our society, \"racist\" is seen as one of the most evil things you can be.  Like, cartoonishly evil.  If you asked most Americans who the most evil person to ever live was, Adolph Hitler would probably be among the top picks - no matter the political affiliations of who you ask.  A Klan member in a white hood is seen as unambiguously evil.  And so when a person, whose whole definition of \"racism\" is tied to that cartoonishly evil caricature, gets accused of \"supporting racist policies\" - or even better, something as ambiguous as \"privilege\" - they feel like you're comparing them to a pointy-hood-wearing, cross-burning, full-on RACIST.  Put yourself in that position for a second.  You're an average American, you think Hitler was bad and that all men are created equal, and you get accused of being a straight-up Nazi... you're going to have a visceral reaction to that.  You're going to think \"not only is this person wrong, but they must have an OUTRAGEOUS definition of 'racism' to ever consider ME to be anything of the sort\".  That's a very natural response for someone to have to such a heinous accusation, in their minds - no manipulation required.  \n\nNow add on top of that, the fact that there ARE partisan bad actors attempting to use this effect to win people over to their side politically.  You might argue, as the OP does, that this is done IN ORDER TO let them get away with actual racism.  But I would argue that it's just done to polarize people.  If they convince people that liberals are overly hysterical when it comes to racism, then it's easier to convince them that liberals are overly hysterical when it comes to the environment, or human rights, or whatever else their political agenda calls for.  \n\nIn that sense, they're not training conservatives to look the other way when real racism occurs (although that's a fortunate side effect for the actual real racists out there).  Moreso, they're training conservatives to look the other way whenever the interests of the rich capitalist class needs them to.",

Just that they often tend to be divorced from the academic discussions on the topic, and as a result they often tend to misdiagnose the CAUSES of those inequalities.  \n\n> That is pretty closely tied to the reason they hate affirmative action, because it's always sold as \"taking from the haves and giving to the have nots\", but we all know the haves don't lose shit.

Lots of rural white folk out there who think the reason their communities have it bad is because Affirmative Action put a thumb on the scale.  When in reality, the forces at work against rural white communities are much the same ones that are ruining the lives of urban black communities.  But those kinds of academic discussions are often frowned upon in rural conservative circles - too \"Marxist\" for their tastes.",

They have covered a wide swath of grievances and gathered so many under their umbrella, that by now they have a huge spectrum of disgruntled Americans (over one thing or the other). \n\nTl/dr: race issues may me forefront with a certain percentage of voters, but the successful \"bundling\" of a broad array of anti-progressive grievances (some valid, some reactionary) likely draws in more supporters who aren't particularly racist personally.",

Broader concepts of racism (and bigotry in general) have actually been fairly widely accepted compared to a couple decades ago and it was a pretty steady progression until around when Trump first got elected - it's way more of a partisan divide as to what people accept rather than simply being the \"broader public\" desensitized in a more general way.\n\nAlso, what do you mean \"no leaks\"? Conservative politicians have been actively skirting around various new forms of racist expression *in public* for like 50 years, coming up with new ways of saying the same old things but somewhat hidden, and then moving-on/altering as they got uncovered in a perpetual cat and mouse game. Calling out *that deliberate process* of trying to inject racist ideas into public discourse in new ways has been a big part of what you're describing...

So, you stop saying \"n****r out loud, but say welfare queens, gangsters, DEI, etc. You create policies that target Black people negatively, explicitly or implicitly, i.e., tax cuts, getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse, neighborhood schools, etc.  Because You don't explicitly use n****r, you maintain your plausible deniability. This way, you can go on shows and give speeches and say, \" I never said n*****! How dare you play the race card!!\" You also condition your supporters to dismiss the concerns of black people when they rightly call out the new policies for being targeted to negatively affect Black people racist.  As the decades go by, the political party engaging in this behavior manages to convince the majority ethnic group that the other political party is only for those Black people we're trying to bother and other weirdos who don't count. \n  Now, 2025, we're on the precedence of where the pretense is gone. I will not be surprised to hear the N-word said outloud on TV and other political proceedings and written into actual policies again. Not by entertainers, but by average people. The circle is almost complete. \n  Your vigorous defense of the Maga Republican double speak leads me to question, where do you stand on this issue?  It can't be you're ignorant, because you keep coming back with reasons why that can't possibly be the a thing. So, the only conclusion I can draw is that you must approve of the tactics.",

That clearly implies that you think it is definitionally not a racism to use stereotypical chinese dining and shopping habits when coming to the determination on the origin of covid. This is the problem with how the left broadly defines racism. \n\nFirst, it is always a binary, 0 to 60, mindset. Supporting the zoonotic origin theory could not possibly be inherently racist, because...what? Because you've decided it is a more likely explanation, therefore it's not a racism? That's a very poor rationale. Say that to all the Asian people who've had it shouted at them that they eat bats, smdh. \n\nSecondly, it relies far too much on your personal and arbitrary determination on the operation of millions of other people's minds. Because, as you say here\n\n>there was no evidence for that hypothesis, and most people who believed it didn't do so because they had seen compelling evidence, they did so because they distrust chinese people due to being racists.\n\nThat's just like, your opinion man. There absolutely was evidence that the virus leaked from the lab. To say otherwise is a flat out lie. Now, you may have determined that the evidence for a zoonotic origin outweighs the evidence for a lab leak. That's a reasonable position. But to claim there is none just betrays your own ignorance. \n\nBut then you go a step further and claim, without any nuance at all, that every single person who feels that the lab leak is a more likely explanation came to that determination because \"they distrust chinese people due to being racists.\" This is exactly why more and more people roll their eyes at the racism charge. \n\nFinally, you also betray your close minded American mindset. What about all the Taiwanese people who have determined it was more likely caused by a lab leak? Are they also racists as well. What about the chinese who believe it came from a lab? Some feel it came from a chinese lab. Others feel it came from an American lab. Are those also racist positions?\n\nThe truth is, guys like you are just really really simple. You can't handle nuance, despite your claims to the contrary. Any disagreement is immediately dismissed in the malicious way possible, because you can't handle discussion. It's really pathetic tbh.",

No objective person can have looked at the evidence and claim there is zero evidence for the lab leak. That's simply absurd.

But if you claim there is not a single shred of evidence for the lab leak, you're just willfully ignorant. Even Fauci acknowledged there is some evidence ffs.",

I've not read the German report, but I have now read multiple articles about it and they all consistently point out that the German dossier contains no proof of the lab leak hypothesis, it was also completed one year before the WHO's report on the origin of COVID 19 which found no proof for the lab leak hypothesis, and determined that a natural origin was the most likely based on what evidence is available. I have yet to see any actual evidence that it originated in a lab other than some people saying they believe it did, which is not evidence.",

And your response is to say, not outright because if you actually laid it out it would sound moronic, 'because you take issue with one tiny phenomenon on the left, that means you are conservative'. It doesn't matter to you what I think about universal health care, Palestine, or any number of issues that actually matter. All that matters is I've strayed from the plantation on this one issue, therefore I'm excommunicated. You're literally a caricature of everything wrong with the left.",

It's very simple to understand, and has nothing to do with racism, but information technology.\n\nAbout 13 years ago or so, there was a round of shootings in the news, and Google felt pressure to remove anything gun-related from being listed from Google Shopping as quickly as possible.\n\nYou'd figure that Google is the king of sifting through information, so they'd have amazing databases setup to block only Gun sellers and gun-related products with near perfect accuracy?\n\nNope.\n\nGoogle used a basic string match for \"gun\" and blocked not only Guns, but Gundams and Gunpla and other non-gun related innocent products.\n\nWhat's the moral of this story?\n\nIf the smart guys at Google can fuck up trying to quickly sift through a large pile of unstructured information, do you really expect non-technical Government workers to get it perfect on their first shot?\n\nWhat's more likely? They just hate Indian code talkers in the depths of their soul, or somebody non-technical tasked with trying to comply with some directive to remove some terms from government websites just did a basic keyword search of some terms without understanding the full ramifications?",

Yet, again and again, we see it's part of a pattern of behavior. They do a racist thing, they publicly say they didn't mean it.

No, plausible deniability, this time it was a JOKE, yeah, a joke. Because the richest man in the world making jokes involving architects of the Holocaust is FUNNY, right?\n\nWhen a non-racist does a racist thing, it's super clear that it's not part of a pattern.

It is an objective fact that the administration is recklessly breaking everything that they can without any real awareness of what they are breaking so that they can rebuild a much smaller beauracracy, practically from scratch. Given that this is essentially their stated goal and what their supporters want, it is reasonable to assume that stupid stuff like this will happen. But, if you want to actually preserve information like this and make the process more rational you have to raise an outcry about stupid decisions like using keyword searches and AI to make decisions about how to restructure the government rather than accusing the administration of being \"racist.\" That won't help. Decisions like the one you are complaining about have literally zero human input, it was probably a decision made by an AI. What we need to protest is the overuse of AI and \"technology\" in the current administration of affairs. If they are going to restructure the government, every decision about restructuring needs to be done by a human being so that a human being can be held accountable for it. Right now, they aren't really accountable for particular decisions their AI makes, but they are accountable for the fact that they are using modern, primitive AI models to make serious policy decisions.",

Saving a bit of labor through automation when the stakes are so high and a mistake is so catastrophic doesn't pass a cost-benefit test.\n\nBut why not use labor-saving tools for relatively unimportant fluff, like managing government blogging bullshit?

A liberal will then accuse them of racism for not believing the answer is more outreach / entitlements to raise up.\n\nTo the body of your post, the culmination of all these liberal approaches to engineer more representative student / employee populations is DEI. \n\nDEI is a big umbrella term for any sort of race-aware policy.\n\nSome of that is relatively noncontroversial - like sensitivity audits and trainings - but it has crossed big red lines in some places to race influenced selection of people for advancement, which is a constitutional violation.\n\nThe more conservative position is that DEI, as race aware and grievance based mental model, almost inevitably leads to those lines being crossed - so the Trump team wanted to set a pretty strong direction shift.\n\nNow, the problem here is that on the .gov domain, there are over *seven million pages*. So inevitably, in executing on the directive to scrub that stuff, you\u2019re getting some clumsy ctrl+f searching for DEI charged language, and it\u2019s hitting stuff it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s clumsy execution that most people think is dumb.\n\nPolitical opponents of Trump hold up that stuff as clear evidence of far more nefarious plots, like they\u2019ve uncovered a conspiracy that half of America believes in.\n\nIt\u2019s just not reality.\n\nLiberals prescribe explicit reverse racism to solve implicit bias, conservatives think racism is wrong as an absolute.\n\nInterns in a rush without clear guidance make stupid mistakes on low traffic / low impact info pages.",

Maybe in 300 more years Democrats will finally think of black people as capable human beings.\n\nEverything from this to DEI/affirmative action begins and ends with treating black folks as incapable little children who need standards lowered so they can adequately participate. \n\nI'm sure Gov Hochul will be happy to hear I've managed to learn what a computer is.",

Those kids face more difficulty in school, and the racist teacher justifies their beliefs by claiming that those kids must have been unintelligent from the beginning. It creates a cycle of children that struggle in school, so they're labeled as stupid, they receive less help, and then they struggle more.\n\nEven worse, it only takes a single shithead to undo the work of a whole bunch of decent people. One racist in a position of power can hurt a lot of people while covering up their incompetence/malice. Sadly, they aren't exactly rare. These are also very difficult to prove as racism unless a pattern can be established and a double standard exposed.\n\nConservative Media Figures intentionally oversimplify these issues down to \"Liberals say Math and Grammar is Racist\" to whip up their viewers' anger. Without that anger, their viewers may actually read the studies entirely, rather than the selectively chosen and carefully curated rage bait they've presented.\n\nIt's all a grift to keep you angry at others and not at the rich.",

When Sally demands that she should be able to use protected women's spaces, that's when I have an issue. That demand steps on the rights of women. Can you honestly say that every girl and woman in the US is comfortable with that? Would you be cool if your wife or daughter was forced to use the same locker room with what is a fully grown man? What about their right to feel safe and comfortable in what is a legally designated a female space? What's the point of going through all the trouble of making spaces specifically for women if some dude can simply announce that he is a female and he gets in. This is a complicated issue with no easy answer. No sane person is OK with mistreating homosexuals or transgender people. When those sane people have issues with what you are proposing and are labeled as fascists or homophobic at the get-go just for having a reasonable issue, those people get pissed. Why listen to someone who dismisses and insults you? If you act in a bad faith manner, people will treat you accordingly. Please, for the love of God, don't bring up the loud mouth idiots. No sane person subscribes to their ideology. They ruin everything for everyone and detract from honest discussions.",

For now.\n\nI sincerely believe this is yet another CMV post that could have been avoided by talking to real conservatives in real life in good faith.",

Many did already view DEI as being racist (be it by bigotry of low expectations, or by discrimanting in favor of certain races over others), and with Biden proclaiming the his VP would be a black woman, it was an easy way to discredit her qualifications. \n\nDEI, at least in the belief of many Americans already, is artificially elevating people based on their minority status instead of pure merit, simply lowering standards in favor of those with most minority appeal (see the 'punished by god four times'  meme of a tra*s, fat, black, jewish kid being met with 'bro can be hired anywhere' and 'netflix wants to know your location' by many - ot's certainly not an unpopular belief that someone who ticks diversity quotas can get ahead of those that do not by virtue of what they are).\n\nThen, saying it's racist to criticize someone for claiming to be part of this or that minority for political gain, I would argue, has the effect that is being discussed here - the layman will not agree to blame someone for things like 'this stament can increase racism even if it isn't inherently racist', and so start dismissing claims of racism. \n\n.\n.\n.\n\nMind, I am not arguing FOR these beliefs or stances. I could make solid arguments against most (like DEI lowering standards, or any recognition of racist adjecent rethoric being the same as 'You're not racist? That's what a racist would say!'). But Presidency is a popularity contest, and what the majority believes is rarely what the truth is. \n\nWhat he said implies a criticism of DEI, criticizes being a phony, and paints Kamala as dishonest. Implying more extreme beliefs, presenting an agreeable belief, and smearing your political oponent... shameless and blunt as he may be in delivering it, Trump's rethoric is pretty by-the-book politician talk - it can be true or false, but it's all the same as long as the majority agrees.\n\nHence, I think someone is better off focusing on his more blatant comments - because rather than being 'circumstantial proof', many people take this criticism as proof of someone being bad faith.",

I was just addressing it because a lot of racists rationalize their racism by insisting that they aren't acting out of \"hate\" because they do earnestly believe their racial biases are factual.\n\nThe reason I take issue with people acting like bigotry born out of ignorance rather than malice is because malice is the root of the misinformation that perpetuates the ignorance. And the way they act on the ignorance tends to manifest as malice even when they argue they're just being \"logical\"\n\nTake the \"hate the sin not the sinner\" type homophobes and how their \"I'm loving them by telling them the truth\" behavior is often indistinguishable from hate except in that they insist in their secret heart of hearts they are feeling compassionate anger instead of hateful anger.",

In that context, we\u2019re talking about a nation-state and the choices the government that rules over that state made that led to the pandemic.  Pointing fingers at China for their handling of COVID is not pointing a finger at a \u201crace\u201d of people, but that\u2019s exactly how it was framed at the time by many in the media.  \n\nThe distinction between racism and xenophobia is an important one.  In no case is racism acceptable as a concept, and that word should be reserved for actual cases of racism.  For example, people who hold a dislike toward Americans right now are technically bigoted/xenophobic toward Americans for what Trump is doing\u2026in no way should that sentiment be discussed along the same terms as racism.",

If the 0.01% need to pay back the wealth they stole and it brings the poorest and most disenfranchised back to where they would have been are your goals not achieved?\n\nAlso calling me a Marcusian is damn insulting. For starters I'm a fan of repressive tolerance on both sides thank you. No form of authoritarianism is acceptable from right or left and capitalism remains the best form of balancing markets.

The Democrats generally attract less bad billionaires. It's not ideal but hey this is reality. \n\n>Raising revenue through taxation doesn't resonate. Keep pushing it and see how many more elections you lose. People aren't as dumb as you think. Find me a state that has raised taxes on the rich and seen an increase of wealthy people living there. That's first order thinking and doesn't work in practice.\n\nSo Bernie going around saying tax the rich doesn't resonate with people? Also California exists as a state. Up until very recently when housing costs have driven people away it was attracting rich people to live there while also having high taxes. NIMBYism is going to hurt the Democrats but that's a different conversation. I'd also make the argument that up until the last few months you could count on the US and UK attracting large numbers of foreign billionaires due to the sophistication of their financial services while also having higher taxes than some of the home countries. \n\nSo again if taxes won't work and reparations won't work how would you solve this problem?\n\n>Intersectionality doesn't view the world through a class lens. The fact that you equate poor with minority says more about you than anything else.\n\nI'd say statistics is also a pretty good indicator rather than personal bias. There's a large racial wealth gap for several foundational reasons like ripping up whole communities to build the interstate or the war on drugs. While there are absolutely minorities which are thriving we can't act like certain populations arenty being left behind. \n\n>Not sure how you aren't Marcusian when you have an intersectional view of society - but your word salad tells me this isn't going to be worth of diving deeper on your nuanced opinion of how you can hold both opinions of yourself.\n\nPlease go on. While I agree with the premise of intersectionality - multiple intersecting societal issues are the result of imbalanced power structures rooted in historical racism. I disagree with many of the conclusions such as my distaste for authoritatianism and anticapitalism both of which are parts of critical theory/Marcusian/New Left school of thought.

There was nothing *racist* about 'China virus'. You only think it's racist because you're doing doing the family guy chart in reverse. ie, because chinese people not white, therefore crude criticism = racism. If you went through the last 8 years of commentary from the left about Russia, but changed the word Russia to China, and then presented them as things trump said about China, you would call them all racisms. And this is exactly why OP is wrong, because op and people like you are incapable of stepping outside your preconceived and arbitrary racism guidelines and do any objective reflection.",

But even if it did, your claim then is that 'anyone phrase that stokes racial tension is definitionally a racism'. That is a very broad definition, and it would include lots of phrases you might agree with, like 'Erase Whiteness'. \n\nI don't subscribe to the conservative view regarding racism, which is think was summed up well as 'hatred towards a race of people'. I think its broader than that. However, it's not nearly as broad as the general left position which they can never candidly describe but in my lived experience is 'a criticism levied against a predetermined marginalized group, usually of darker complexion, by a person of a predetermined powerful group, usually of lighter complexion'. Neither the conservative opinion nor the liberal one provides the term 'racism' with any useful meaning.",

People who care about things tend to give more in-depth answers because they have more in-depth understanding. It might make them a little difficult to talk to, but it doesn't make them wrong. It means they have insight they want to share. Sharing ideas is a good thing.\n\n>and then we all learned the word \"xenophobic\"\n\nA lot of folks actually learned that word back in 2001, after 9/11. Maybe you were too young, or just not paying attention.\n\n>could have been avoided by talking to real conservatives in real life in good faith.\n\nDude, I really do try. But conservative idealogy is inherently cruel (\"we like money and power where it is and don't like people trying to change the balance of that money and power\" is essentially the core concept, and that is, by nature, selfish and \"othering\"). But people don't *like* seeing themselves as cruel or selfish, so they engage in mental gymnastics to preserve their ego.\n\nIt makes it very hard to have an earnest conversation. I wish my mom could understand that I don't hate her, I just hate her belief that immigrants are sub-human and should be killed on-sight. I dont hate my coworker for being religious, but I dont think his religion should be the basis of laws that affect people who don't share his religion - Jesus didn't teach that, he said worship at home and in private, and love and accept everyone even if you dont understand them. When I say \"I want my taxes dollars spent on policies that help struggling americans\" I am told I'm entitled and lazy... they're MY TAX DOLLARS, why am I entitled when I want them spent certain ways, may of which don't even help me particularly?\n\nYou can't have real conversations with real conservatives because they are too deep in culture war nonsense, falling for the things the wealthy elite class tells them they should care about, things meant to divide us so we cannot have strength together to fight for each other.",

That's why the conservative definition has narrowed to essentially mean \"someone who actively hates people due to their race\", which is a convenient way to avoid confrontation and self-reflection. \"I have no malice in my heart toward (minority group), I just think they're (racist stereotype)\" = get out of jail free card for conservatives.",

While you try to push for race based policies to create an actually fascist aligned government. That's essentially the Biden years.  Since Fascism is the alignment of private industry with government goals.

If you're hiring an engineer and the one that accessed second best seems more well spoken and just to better get the technical things you talk to them about, that's obviously a value to consider, over a less well spoken, better testing candidate. The fundamental problem is that you can't just ignore things like this, a miscommunication between engineers has made buildings collapse before. \n\nFor something like DEI to properly deal with such things, it would need to properly create a test which can select for ability but doesn't discriminate. [It was determined that it is not mathematically possible to develop such a test.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289624000862) My problem is that the Left considers the loss of ability in industry to be an acceptable loss for fairness, while the right considers it a horrible crime against our prosperity as a nation.",

Since 2010 the definition of racism has been growing broader and broader, and I have heard some incredibly harmless stuff be called racist, more with each passing year. No conservative plot needed, that's just lefties doing their thing. Its a big reason for why I left the party. Obama won the presidency 2x times and instead of celebrating that the US had mostly overcome its troubled past with race, the left doubled down and started talking about how everyone is even more racist than ever. Your claims that this trend isn't real are frankly kind of absurd. \n\nBack to the present, the Navajo code talkers were certainly not DEI hires. But I don't think anyone is claiming that they are. The website articles are being taken down because the focus on race and minority status, rather than personal accomplishments, is DEI. I bet not all of the articles about Navajo soldiers have been taken down, just the ones that were the most overt about lauding diverse ethnic backgrounds. There weren't any articles talking about how brave and amazing soldiers are for being ethnically british or french. \n\nThat being said, do I think this was done in an overly heavy handed way? Sure. As you bring up, the Navajo did bring value specifically because of their heritage, and so their heritage deserves a highlight much more than the heritage of a solider deserves a highlight for being a woman or a hispanic who excelled. It looks like all of the \"diversity is our strength\" articles were taken down, without looking to see if some are more deserved than others. I'm personally not too worried about it - a lot of our foundational values are because of our british heritage, and I don't see many federal articles about how awesome people of british ancestry are. But I think complaints of the changes being too blunt of an attack are fair.",

What that means in practice is that you choose people based on their skin color, gender, etc. so that you have a better ESG rating and can get investments.",
