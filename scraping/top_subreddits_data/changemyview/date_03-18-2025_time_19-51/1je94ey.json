I read in the article that I linked that more people were put to death in just six months than during the combined terms of the previous ten presidents. I personally do not believe in capital punishment and I don't think I'll ever change my mind on that. But please someone try and educate me as to why Trump's term might not actually well and truly mess everything up.",

He worked to make sure it was non-existent.  Trump is taking it back to being a last resort.  13 executions over 17 years is a miniscule number.  That *is* using it as a last resort.  That's less than one execution per year.  Do you really think that not even one person per year is committing a crime worthy of the death penalty? \n\n>more people were put to death in just six months than during the combined terms of the previous ten presidents.\n\nThat says more about those presidents not carrying out justly deserved executions than about Trump.  Again, it was 13 executions.  It's ridiculous that we haven't had 13 executions in the previous ten presidents' terms.  \n\nTrump is making capital punishment a last resort again, when it was previously non-existent.",

We *entrust* (a word with a fundamentally different meaning than 'trust') the government with enacting Justice because it is the only entity capable of doing so with any degree of fairness. 'Justice' enacted by private entities is fundamentally and unavoidably biased. Therefore we must entrust and empower the government to execute people not because we trust them, or because they're right all the time, but because execution is the morally correct response to certain crimes, and they are the only entity that can morally perform that duty.

It would still be bad even if the DP wasn't on the table, because it isn't a big \"oopsie\" if the state puts you in a cage for 50 years. It would still be a problem, albeit a lesser one, even if we were just handing out false convictions of misdemeanors. \n\nBut we aren't. You only get the DP if you are found guilty of crime that you would otherwise do life/many decades in prison for. Adding the DP into the mix only marginally increases the badness of a false conviction. To me at least, being put in a cage for 50 years is only slightly better than a death sentence, and some people have even expressed preference for death over life in prison. \n\nBecause of this, your argument is better characterized by the statement \"false convictions are bad\", not that the DP is bad. If everyone we convicted was guaranteed to be 100% guilty, would you support the DP?\n\nDo you follow now?",

When the exculpatory evidence shows up is absolutely critical to the falsely accused, because if it doesn't show up in their lifetime, so what? From the state's perspective they lived and died guilty. You cannot return a man who served a life sentence his life if it has already ended naturally.\n\nThe moral failing was had when they were falsely convicted of a serious crime, not because they got a marginally worse sentence.\n\nI oppose the death penalty for other reasons, I just think this argument is a poor one to support the death penalty.

I believe all people have the opportunity to change and become functioning members of society.  And in cases where the person never changes or their crimes are too horrific or there is such overwhelming evidence that there is no question of guilt (Dylan Roof tending to be the go-to example for many people), their parole is denied indefinitely.\n\nThere are a lot of countries in the world that go by this model and it tends to be more successful than the US system.\n\nSo again I have to ask, what's your number?

However, one way that I think is useful is to consider the variables that are influencing our projection. It is helpful to be aware to humans are *notoriously* bad about forecasting ([Humans Are Bad at Predicting Futures That Don\u2019t Benefit Them - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/humans-are-bad-at-predicting-futures-that-dont-benefit-them/544709/)), and this is true across many domains. \n\nSo... let's stipulate that we're not very good at predicting things... that means that you're not very good at predicting things. That's not an attack on your concern / your ideals, just something to keep in mind as we consider the likelihood of your predicted outcome. \n\nThe second thing i think we should consider would be something of our own biases. Again, not a critique of your perspective of Trump, but if i asked you, \"is there *anything* you think Trump will do over the next 4 years that *won't* \"mess everything up\", does anything come to mind? if the answer is, \"i think Trump will mess up pretty much *everything... \",* then the likelihood we're right about that is fairly low, or, at best, not very useful. Even if Trump was the world's most effective operator, successfully, \"messing everything up\" would require expert skill and incredibly \"good\" fortune. \n\nWhich makes me point to the third thing. Even if you're right, there is a substantial amount of chance that dictates outcomes. And chance being chance means we can't predict outcomes w/ much certainty. \n\nSo, you're probably ok in being concerned about a risk, but probably don't need to be as certain about the outcome.",
