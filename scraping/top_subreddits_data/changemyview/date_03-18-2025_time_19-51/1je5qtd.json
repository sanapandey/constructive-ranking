    "selftext": "I don\u2019t know how ignorant Trump\u2019s supporters have to be to praise White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt\u2019s statement that 'France would be speaking German.'\n\nOf course, it\u2019s undeniable that America's efforts in World War II and its aid during the Cold War are facts that Europe should remember, and this argument is indeed a useful one. I also agree that when Europe is free-riding on defense, such remarks can serve as a witty response.\n\nHowever, one of the very few places where this argument simply doesn\u2019t work is when talking about the Statue of Liberty\u2014because the Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States in celebration of the 100th anniversary of American independence. Without France\u2019s help, the American Revolution would not have succeeded, the United States would not have had a president, and it might still be like its most despised neighbor, Canada,(for now) with a real 'King of America'\u2014Charles III.\n\nKaroline Leavitt\u2019s remarks only highlight the Trump team\u2019s ignorance of history, or worse, their malicious tendency to cherry-pick facts that suit their narrative while ignoring everything else.\n\nWhat I mean is, in any other situation, her quip wouldn\u2019t have been met with such irony. But she just had to choose one of the very few contexts where it carries a strong sense of irony to blurt it out. Isn\u2019t that ignorant enough?",

So, is President Trump going to send the Statue of Liberty back to France?\n\nTo which Leavitt responded with\n\n>Absolutely not. My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now. So they should be very grateful to our great country\n\nLooking at this, I don't see anything that indicates anyone is ignorant of history.  France provided the Statue of Liberty as a gift to the United States which isn't something argued by anyone.  \n\nIn addition, the United States played a key role in the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany during WW2, including the liberation of France.  This is also, not really debated by any side.  \n\nTo me, this was a biting remark made by a French politician followed up by a biting remark made by Leavitt.  Am I pleased to see this?  No.  I am not happy with how the Trump administration has dealt with our allies and think he's doing tremendous damage (although to be fair it's not exactly uncommon for France to take jabs at the US).  However, nothing in the exchange is ignorant of history.",

It's just 2 biting remarks at each other.  \n\nNobody was suggesting that France didn't contribute to the US war for independence and by highlighting the statue of liberty France was saying that the US doesn't represent liberty.  The response was to highlight that France has liberty because the US aided them in WW2.  There's nothing ignorant there.  \n\nLike I said, I think the Trump Administration is doing a lot of damage to the US position on the global scale.  However, this back and forth are just verbal jabs.  \n\n  \nIt's also worth noting that, when we look at history, France didn't start contributing to the US war of independence until the US actually looked like it was winning.  They resisted requests for support until the Battle of Saratoga, which was a devastating loss for England culminating in thousands of prisoners as an entire British army surrendered to the Americans.  France was still bitter with the loss of territories from the 7 years war and realized that the US might actually win and this would be a good way to get revenge on England since it looked like it would succeed.  That's when they got involved.  Make no mistake, it was extremely helpful as the US received more aid and supplies but it only came once France thought the US might win.",

This absolutely had a tangible effect.\n\nNo country was interested in dealing with the Nazis until it became clear the Nazis were going to be a problem for them or they would be directly impacted.  That's how most politics work.  People would rather not get involved in something if they could avoid it.\n\n1. France and Britain had no trouble selling off Czechoslovakia if it placated the Nazis.  They only finally started preparing for war once it became clear that Nazi Germany had no intention of stopping its conquests which meant they were going to be attacked at some point.\n2. USSR literally formed a semi alliance with Nazi Germany and agreed to divide Eastern Europe between them.\n\n So yeah... lots of people like to poke at the US for not getting militarily involved until it directly impacted them but that's pretty true for most nations.  France and England just couldn't avoid it anymore.  Not to mention, the US public didn't want to get involved but the government still found ways to support the allies even when not directly being involved.",

Also, the US pays LESS tariffs on dairy than other countries because they are part of USMCA, so the US is actually getting a deal from Canada. Also the US already had tariffs on Canada too (lumber, sugar, etc) so it goes both ways. Both countries protect their dairy industry (the US subsidizes it). Both countries agreed to having a handful of goods under tariff, but with the majority free trade, under the USMCA that Trump signed and said was the best trade deal ever.",

This situation can be compared to the struggles faced by the U.S. and Russia in Afghanistan, though it was made worse by severe supply constraints and communication difficulties between England and its forces in the colonies. Moreover, the British were racing against time, as support from the home front was lukewarm at best, and they were already burdened with the pressures of three other ongoing wars.\n\nAs for the necessity of French generals, American officers had extensive combat experience, having fought and defeated French forces during the French and Indian War. They also had similar training to their British counterparts, but with the added advantages of better knowledge of the local terrain, widespread support from the civilian population, and a deeper connection to the cause. While the French played a crucial role in the outcome of the war\u2014and it\u2019s difficult to say what might have happened had they not joined\u2014their intervention came only after it became clear the Americans had a fighting chance. It would be unwise, then, to assume that America would have inevitably lost without French support.\n\nIn contrast, when Americans entered World War II, France was already a defeated nation and would not be the country it is today without U.S. involvement. That said, it may not be the most polite or productive to point this out, as one could also argue that more could have been done to prevent Nazi Germany from overrunning France in the first place.",

Not to mention the hypocrisy of people who've obsessed over the previous president's son's dick pics going on about how deranged others are.\n\nRegardless, Republicans continue to struggle with why people despise their approach to immigration. Probably for the same reason they struggle with why people despise their approach to everything else. Republicans prioritize being profoundly performative and cruel to play to their idiotic base over doing anything effective. Trump's anti-immigration efforts result in less deportations, less border security, and less organization for everyone involved in the immigration process, but because he makes a big show of how much he absolutely hates immigrants and wants them chained and sent to forever prisons, that's all that matters.",

And in this case, the scrutiny is fair. The original comment isn\u2019t anti-American or pro-France it\u2019s about respecting the full context of history instead of reducing it to a punchline. \n\nYou can similarly criticize S\u00e9journ\u00e9 for the same reason if you find his symbolic rebuke unfair, but even if you do, the classy response would be to say \"hey you gifted us this statue because you see us as a beacon of freedom in the world and we've been working hard as a nation to live up to that ideal for hundreds of years, while we may not agree on all the fine details of immigration policy right now, that commitment is still alive and well in America.\" \n\nHer actual response though was basically \"shut up, you would've lost WWII without us.\" To me that is far more stupid, crass, and delusional than what S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said. Especially in light of his main point, which is that U.S. immigration policy under this administration has been an ongoing human rights nightmare and absolutely worth condemning.",

                            "body": "When looking at history, there's 2 key points to keep in mind about the USSR in WW2.  \n\n1. One of the things rarely discussed about WW2 was the US contribution to the USSR during WW2.  The US leveraged the lend lease program to provide aid to the USSR as well and shipped an incredible amount of weapons, clothes, raw materials, and other essentials.  There was a period of time that the USSR fundamentally relied on those shipments for its survival.  This largely got swept under the rug and discounted by the USSR as the war was coming to an end because of the rising conflict between the US and USSR.  There's a decent argument to be made that without US aid, the USSR would not have been able to physically resist the Nazis as much of their military capacity was destroyed in the early stages of Operation Barbarossa. \n2. The USSR was absolutely the heaviest fighting force on the ground combatting the Nazis with 0 debate for much of the war (post 1941).  However, this can largely be blamed on them as the USSR viewed the allies with suspicion and wanted an alliance with Nazi Germany.  The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is generally referred to as a non-aggression pact but it is far closer to an alliance than most will admit.  It included plans for how to divide eastern Europe culminating in both nations attacking Eastern Europe at the same time (suggesting some level of coordination).  So, yes, the USSR made up most of the manpower in Europe during WW2 but it was largely because they were fighting a supposed ally they helped build (with Stalin supposedly stunned to learn Germany betrayed them and attacked).",

Some communist (\"tankie\" / fascist) apologists even excuse this with the claim that this was buying time,\n\nThat claim of buying time falls apart completely if you know that the USSR had had a long term strategic alliance with Germany which was even the place where Germany tested it's tanks and was renewed by the USSR with Nazi Germany before anywhere else in the world knew of their joint plans for WWII and they continued to provide the crucial materials that made the German war machine possible for the entire time until their close frienship and alliance broke down in 1941. Not, we should note, becaus of anything the Soviets did against the Nazis.\n\n> the Soviets suffered over 20 million casualties\n\nThis speaks more about the terrible inefficency of the Russian army after Stalin had imprisoned and excecuted all sorts of key generals before and early on during WWII. \n\nThe fact that the USSR was able to stand up again and keep fighting after these losses is entirely due to the crucial largess of the USA. People often talk about the materiel and machines, but far more important is that most of the equipment produced in the USSR itself as only produced becuase of British and American support and experties of various kinds.",

Without the use of those machines through Lend-Lease, we would lose this war.\u201d\n\n-Josef Stalin\n\n\nI would like to express my opinion and tell in plain form about Stalin's opinion on the question of whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without help from the USA and England. First of all, I would like to talk about Stalin's words, which he repeated several times when we had \"free conversations\" among ourselves. He said directly that if the USA had not helped us, we would not have won this war: alone with Nazi Germany, we would not have withstood its onslaught and would have lost the war. No one officially touched on this topic among us, and Stalin, I think, left no written traces of his opinion anywhere, but I am stating here that he noted this circumstance several times in conversations with me.\n\n-Nikita Khrushchev\n\n\"People say that the allies didn't help us. But it cannot be denied that the Americans sent us materiel without which we could not have formed our reserves or continued the war. The Americans provided vital explosives and gunpowder. And how much steel! Could we really have set up the production of our tanks without American steel? And now they are saying that we had plenty of everything on our own.\"\n\n-Georgy Zhukov",
