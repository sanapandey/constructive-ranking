    "id": "1jegcr7",
    "selftext": "I know people throw around the cult word both at democrats and republicans pretty often as like a jab, but in my eyes, MAGA specifically functions pretty much like a cult would.\n\nA pretty big element of what makes a cult into a cult is absolute and unquestioning loyalty to their leader, we see this over and over again with Trump. Where if you do not show unwavering loyalty to him, he will aggressively go after your career along with his supporters.\n\nWe've seen this with;\n\n**1: Mitt Romney, he was the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump in the first impeachment trial in 2020. Trump publicly ridiculed Romney, calling him a loser and mocking him as a failed presidential candidate and then his supporters also targeted Romney, particularly at Republican events. I realize Romney remains a senator, but his standing within the Republican Party has been diminished, with Trump supporters frequently attacking him.**\n\n**2: Alexander Vindman, who testified  Trumps first impeachment trial, stating that Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was inappropriate. Trump and his team shat on Vindman, questioning his loyalty and suggesting ulterior motives. Vindman was then removed from his position at the National Security Council after the trial, and then he retired from the military, saying that a campaign of bullying and retaliation by Trump and his supporters hindered his career.**\n\n**3:  Liz Cheney, who criticized Trump for his role in J6, She voted to impeach him for inciting the insurrection. Trump then aggressively campaigned against Cheney, calling her a warmonger and a RINO and publicly endorsed her primary opponent in Wyoming, which then  lead to her losing then primary race in 2022 by a pretty big margin, largely due to Trumps influence in putting his voters against her.**\n\nNow these are just the 3 at the top of my head, there was also some 'minor' stuff, like him attacking Rogan (before the podcast) because he supported RFK instead of Trump.\n\nAnother big element is the dismissal of evidence that go against their narrative or beliefs or whatever. \n\n**1: The absolute biggest example of this would obviously be the 2020 election, Trump knowingly lied, time and time again about the election being stolen and how he was the actual winner, even though over 60 court cases challenging the election results were dismissed, often by judges appointed by Trump. Even though recounts in key states like Georgia and Arizona confirmed Bidens victory. Even though Trumps own DOJ, led by William Barr, found no evidence of significant fraud. (William Barr is another person that Trump went against because he didn't show absolute loyalty, and this guy is apparently a RINO to MAGA now).** And this is still something that an insane amount of Republicans still believe, around [70% of republicans still do not believe in the 2020 election.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23895856-cnn-poll-on-biden-economy-and-elections/). And the 2024 election just brought all of this stuff up again with takes like ''Kamala got 6 million less voters, where did they go? This just shows that 2020 was stolen even more!''\n\n**2: Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump repeatedly denied or minimized the findings of US intelligence agencies regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. Multiple US intelligence agencies, the senate intelligence committee (led by Republicans btw), and Robert Mueller confirmed that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trumps campaign. Trump dismissed these findings as a hoax and publicly sided with Putin, saying he believed Putins denial of interference over US intelligence and his supporters accepted his framing of the Russia investigation as a witch hunt, still to this day they've somehow turned the entire narrative around the 2016 thing into ''nah man it was all a hoax'' but if you look into it, it was very clearly not a hoax.**\n\nThese are just 2 vital elements that i've focused on but it seems to me that MAGA is quite cult-like atleast when we look at how they act just for these 2 elements.",

            "body": "Trump certainly is a charismatic demagogue and to that extent he commands a cult of personality. \n\nI don\u2019t know who you want to count as MAGA, but if we\u2019re including low propensity, traditionally disengaged voters that put Trump over the top by coming out to cast bullet ballots, I don\u2019t think you can characterize them as cult-like. \n\nYou could call these voters gullible, but they are not organized nor are they ideologues the way cults are. They probably couldn\u2019t name any of Trump\u2019s policy record or proposals beyond slogans like \u2018build the wall\u2019 \u2018America first\u2019 or vague notions of reducing crime and taxes. \n\nThese are fair-weather fans of Trump who will sour on Trump when the economy sours. They will stay home for the midterms and special elections. And they are the reason the next Republican presidential primary will be competitive\u2014their support will not translate to Vance even if he remains Trump\u2019s loyal lieutenant and receives his endorsement. \n\nAnd I would argue that this cohort of MAGA far outnumbers the dedicated MAGA activist \u2018cult like\u2019 groups like Moms for Liberty or paramilitary groups like the Three Percenters.",

The culture surrounding MAGA is anything Trump says goes. He starts rambling about imaginary fentanyl coming into the US from Canada and claiming that The US subsidizes Canada' economy, and MAGAs immediately start parroting it. He invited Zelenskyy to meet at the White House just to bizarrely insult and berate him, and MAGAs start going on about how Zelenskyy was supposedly being disrespectful. MAGAs don't believe the news if Trump contradicts what journalists report. Elon Musk literally does a fascist gesture, MAGAs see him do it with their own eyes, but insist that it's not what it is. They antagonize and attempt to alienate anyone who criticizes Trump by saying they have \"Trump derangement syndrome\". They reject the evidence of their eyes and ears because Trump and his administration tell them to. That's cult-like behaviour.",

Lies, Misinformation, and Gaslighting\n\nHe repeats lies until they feel like truth (\"The election was stolen!\").\n\nIf caught lying, he simply denies it or blames the media.\n\nHis followers are trained to distrust outside sources, so fact-checking is useless.\n\n\n3. Fear and Doom Predictions\n\nHe tells his followers that if he loses, America will be destroyed (\"If I don\u2019t win, you won\u2019t have a country anymore.\").\n\nUses fear of immigrants, crime, and \"woke ideology\" to keep people paranoid and dependent on him.\n\n\n4. Encouraging Violence (While Denying It)\n\nHe tells supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d and then pretends he didn\u2019t mean it literally.\n\nUses coded language that allows plausible deniability while riling up extremists (e.g., \"Stand back and stand by.\").\n\n\n5. Endless Grievance and Victimhood\n\nHe presents himself and his followers as constant victims (\"They\u2019re not after me, they\u2019re after you!\").\n\nEvery lawsuit, indictment, or impeachment is framed as a political attack, never as accountability.\n\n\n6. Cult of Personality & Messiah Complex\n\nHis followers wear his face on shirts, wave flags with his name, and even pray to him.\n\nThey see him as a savior sent by God to \"fix\" America. Some even compare him to Jesus.\n\n\n7. Devaluing Experts and Institutions\n\nHe teaches followers to distrust scientists, judges, journalists, and even doctors (\"Don\u2019t trust the experts!\").\n\nIf reality doesn\u2019t align with his claims, the experts must be lying.\n\n\n8. Never Admitting Defeat or Fault\n\nHe never concedes, even when the evidence is overwhelming (\"I won by a lot!\").\n\nWhen things go wrong, he shifts blame to others\u2014Pence, McConnell, or even his own lawyers.\n\n\n9. Isolation from Dissenting Voices\n\nHe encourages his followers to only trust Trump-approved media (Fox News was too soft; now it\u2019s OANN, Newsmax, and Truth Social).\n\nDissenting conservatives are labeled traitors (Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, even Tucker Carlson when he questioned Trump).\n\n\n10. Symbolism and Rituals\n\nHis rallies are like religious revivals, full of chanting, emotional highs, and performative loyalty.\n\nHe demands constant displays of devotion\u2014hats, flags, bumper stickers, and pledges of fealty.",

He won the primary for being acceptable to moderates and under the theory that he could pull some moderate democrats as well, but \"conservative\" conservatives kind of had to plug their nose on the pick at the time. As such, Republicans turning on him when he went against Trump isn't as much of a 180 as it might seem from a 10,000 ft view.\n\nNot familiar enough with the other cases to comment on them, but the Romney case I would argue is more Trump tapping into some of the latent frustrations in the GOP than convincing people to turn on Romney out of nowhere.",

That in itself is admirable on some level, especially considering he survived an assassination attempt. Politics aside, Trump would look like a hero if you told someone that scenario without the context. \n\n1-2 (part 2). Both of those scenarios would be much easier to swallow if it didn\u2019t look like a continuous trend in politics for the past decade, especially when you see the sheer animosity and hatred people have for Trump specifically. This motherfucker lives rent free in so many peoples\u2019 heads it amazing. Honestly I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an alternative Republican that can accomplish half that.

When Liz Cheney criticized Trump for January 6th, people wanted to throw her in jail. When the courts ruled that what Trump is doing in office right now is unconstitutional, Trump says they should be impeached.\n\nDo you seriously think this isn't a cult like style of running a political party?

Sure, burning down cars at a Tesla dealership is extreme, but it wasn't led by a \"charismatic figure\". So by your own definition, this doesn't constitute cult-like activity.\n\n2. I don't think the Democratic party is fixated on a single politician enough to argue that they're a cult or engaging in cult-like behavior. \n\n3. Agreed.\n\n4. Sure, other political parties try to push their agenda onto other people in order to gain support, but I don't see any Democrats threatening to lock each other up for not supporting Biden or Kamala, or calling to hang members of their own party that stand up to them. This is the point OP is trying to make. The Republican party is set up in a way where anyone who disagrees with Trump or stands up to his actions face some sort of backlash. \n\n5. I agree.",

His premise was cults make their members do things they might not agree with or want to do, but do it anyway. He then said the Democrats operate more like a cult than MAGA. One example of the Democrats being more like a cult was during the SOTU when elected officials that claim to be in support of Americans refused to stand for a child that had beaten cancer because their cult decided not to stand for any reason. It was a total embarrassment for the party and looked ten times worse on television. Then Trump pointed out the families of victims who were murdered by illegal immigrants, no Democrats stood or clapped. Again, the Democrats exhibited cult like behavior by openly signaling that the murdering of young women by illegals was acceptable in their eyes. Just disgusting.\n\nMAGAs are not a cult by any definition because the people that consider themselves 'MAGA' disagree on quite a few issues like Israel/Palestine, Ukraine/Russia, how far certain laws should go, and how some laws don't go far enough. That's literally the opposite of a cult. MAGAs can shift so quickly on things, the rest of the group thinks it's an overreaction and don't agree. Elon Musk is their darling one day, and the next day he's a foreigner that needs to shut up and know his place. A cult would pick a position and stick to it to the death and that's not MAGA.",

                    "body": "Look at the context given by OP. He is saying that MAGA functions like a cult, which is true. When Mike Pence stood up to Trump after January 6? \"Hang pence\". When Mitt Romney voted to convict Trump during the first impeachment trial, Republicans kicked him to the curb, and I've personally seen many people say he is \"Not a true Republican\". Similar story for Liz Cheney. When the courts deemed that what Trump is doing currently is unconstitutional? \"Impeach the judges\".\n\nLook at the way the Republican party all wears their stupid MAGA hats. Look at the way they claim to be the party of law and order, but bend over backwards to defend a 34 count felon. Look at how they parrot whatever bullshit comes out of Trump's mouth word for word. Look at how they complained about how awful the economy was under Biden, but switched up under Trump.\n\nThe main feature of a cult is their unconditional, unilateral support for their leader under all circumstances, and the MAGA cult definitely checks that box. Anyone who goes against Trump needs to be \"hanged\" or \"impeached\" or \"isn't a true Republican\". If they don't want to be called a cult in the future, they should stop acting like one. They're just a bunch of ass kissers.",

I can tell you with great certainty that they do not believe all the same things and differ on many subjects.\n\nIt doesn't matter. Let's compare it to a sports team's fanbase for a second. Sports fans of a particular team, let's say the Packers, can have disagreements on who they think is the best player or who they think should be signed during the offseason, yada yada yada. But they'll still put on their goofy cheese hats, go to Lambeau Field and cheer on the Packers no matter what. Can you change the mind of a sports fan on which team they should support? Chances are, no. There's no critical thinking in sports because there doesn't need to be.\n\n>There were 'MAGAs' that were negatively affected by those firings. Do you think they agree that Musk cutting their job without doing any research on the job's contribution to the government was a good thing? I doubt it.\n\nGoing back to the sports analogy, this is like saying \"Some of those Packers fans moved to Chicago and are now Bears fans, so the Packers fanbase isn't a cult\". This doesn't really make sense. That doesn't change the personality of the other 99.9% of the fanbase/voter base. Most MAGAs have proved time and time again that they'll support their leader no matter what.",

                    "body": "Trump uses classic cult tactics to keep his followers loyal and radicalized. Here are some of the biggest ones:\n\n1. Us vs. Them Mentality\n\nHe convinces his followers that they are part of a special, persecuted group fighting against a corrupt elite (\"deep state,\" \"globalists,\" \"fake news\").\n\nAnyone outside the movement is an enemy\u2014Democrats, RINOs, the media, scientists, even judges ruling against him.\n\n\n2. Lies, Misinformation, and Gaslighting\n\nHe repeats lies until they feel like truth (\"The election was stolen!\").\n\nIf caught lying, he simply denies it or blames the media.\n\nHis followers are trained to distrust outside sources, so fact-checking is useless. Fake news and alternative facts were literally started by trump in 2015/2016\n\n\n3. Fear and Doom Predictions\n\nHe tells his followers that if he loses, America will be destroyed (\"If I don\u2019t win, you won\u2019t have a country anymore.\").\n\nUses fear of immigrants, crime, and \"woke ideology\" to keep people paranoid and dependent on him.\n\n\n4. Encouraging Violence (While Denying It)\n\nHe tells supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d and then pretends he didn\u2019t mean it literally.\n\nUses coded language that allows plausible deniability while riling up extremists (e.g., \"Stand back and stand by.\").\n\n\n5. Endless Grievance and Victimhood\n\nHe presents himself and his followers as constant victims (\"They\u2019re not after me, they\u2019re after you!\").\n\nEvery lawsuit, indictment, or impeachment is framed as a political attack, never as accountability.\n\n\n6. Cult of Personality & Messiah Complex\n\nHis followers wear his face on shirts, wave flags with his name, and even pray to him.\n\nThey see him as a savior sent by God to \"fix\" America. Some even compare him to Jesus. Remember the weird white things on their ears when trump got shot?! \n\n\n7. Devaluing Experts and Institutions\n\nHe teaches followers to distrust scientists, judges, journalists, and even doctors (\"Don\u2019t trust the experts!\").\n\nIf reality doesn\u2019t align with his claims, the experts must be lying.\n\n\n8. Never Admitting Defeat or Fault\n\nHe never concedes, even when the evidence is overwhelming (\"I won by a lot!\").\n\nWhen things go wrong, he shifts blame to others\u2014Pence, McConnell, or even his own lawyers.\n\n\n9. Isolation from Dissenting Voices\n\nHe encourages his followers to only trust Trump-approved media (Fox News was too soft; now it\u2019s OANN, Newsmax, and Truth Social).\n\nDissenting conservatives are labeled traitors (Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, even Tucker Carlson when he questioned Trump).\n\n\n10. Symbolism and Rituals\n\nHis rallies are like religious revivals, full of chanting, emotional highs, and performative loyalty.\n\nHe demands constant displays of devotion\u2014hats, flags, bumper stickers, and pledges of fealty.\n\n\nTrump didn\u2019t invent these tactics, but he perfected them in modern politics. The result? A movement where logic, facts, and accountability no longer matter\u2014only loyalty to him. So saying MAGA is not a cult is honestly laugable if it was so incredibly dangerous and damaging !",

Loyalty and consequences for opposing a party leader are not unique to MAGA; similar dynamics exist within both major political parties. Figures like Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, and Tulsi Gabbard have faced backlash from Democrats for not aligning with party expectations, just as Romney and Cheney faced criticism from Republican voters. Losing political influence due to opposing a popular party leader is a natural outcome in a democratic system, not evidence of cult-like behavior.\n\nRegarding the dismissal of evidence, skepticism toward election outcomes is not exclusive to MAGA. Many Democrats questioned the legitimacy of the 2016 election, with claims of Russian interference and voter suppression. If questioning election integrity is a defining trait of a cult, then a significant portion of the political spectrum would fall under that definition. Additionally, the skepticism toward the Russia investigation was fueled by legitimate concerns, such as the Steele Dossier\u2019s connections to the Clinton campaign, making this more a matter of political disagreement than blind loyalty.\n\nUltimately, a cult demands absolute obedience, isolates its members, and controls their behavior, none of which apply to MAGA. While it is a highly passionate political movement, it does not function as a cult in any meaningful sense. If strong loyalty to a political leader were enough to meet that definition, then numerous political movements throughout history would also qualify.",

But Trump absolutely  uses classic cult tactics to keep his followers loyal and radicalized. Here are some of the biggest ones:\n\n1. Us vs. Them Mentality\n\nHe convinces his followers that they are part of a special, persecuted group fighting against a corrupt elite (\"deep state,\" \"globalists,\" \"fake news\").\n\nAnyone outside the movement is an enemy\u2014Democrats, RINOs, the media, scientists, even judges ruling against him.\n\n\n2. Lies, Misinformation, and Gaslighting\n\nHe repeats lies until they feel like truth (\"The election was stolen!\").\n\nIf caught lying, he simply denies it or blames the media.\n\nHis followers are trained to distrust outside sources, so fact-checking is useless.\n\n\n3. Fear and Doom Predictions\n\nHe tells his followers that if he loses, America will be destroyed (\"If I don\u2019t win, you won\u2019t have a country anymore.\").\n\nUses fear of immigrants, crime, and \"woke ideology\" to keep people paranoid and dependent on him.\n\n\n4. Encouraging Violence (While Denying It)\n\nHe tells supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d and then pretends he didn\u2019t mean it literally.\n\nUses coded language that allows plausible deniability while riling up extremists (e.g., \"Stand back and stand by.\").\n\n\n5. Endless Grievance and Victimhood\n\nHe presents himself and his followers as constant victims (\"They\u2019re not after me, they\u2019re after you!\").\n\nEvery lawsuit, indictment, or impeachment is framed as a political attack, never as accountability.\n\n\n6. Cult of Personality & Messiah Complex\n\nHis followers wear his face on shirts, wave flags with his name, and even pray to him.\n\nThey see him as a savior sent by God to \"fix\" America. Some even compare him to Jesus.\n\n\n7. Devaluing Experts and Institutions\n\nHe teaches followers to distrust scientists, judges, journalists, and even doctors (\"Don\u2019t trust the experts!\").\n\nIf reality doesn\u2019t align with his claims, the experts must be lying.\n\n\n8. Never Admitting Defeat or Fault\n\nHe never concedes, even when the evidence is overwhelming (\"I won by a lot!\").\n\nWhen things go wrong, he shifts blame to others\u2014Pence, McConnell, or even his own lawyers.\n\n\n9. Isolation from Dissenting Voices\n\nHe encourages his followers to only trust Trump-approved media (Fox News was too soft; now it\u2019s OANN, Newsmax, and Truth Social).\n\nDissenting conservatives are labeled traitors (Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, even Tucker Carlson when he questioned Trump).\n\n\n10. Symbolism and Rituals\n\nHis rallies are like religious revivals, full of chanting, emotional highs, and performative loyalty.\n\nHe demands constant displays of devotion\u2014hats, flags, bumper stickers, and pledges of fealty.\n\n\n\"a cult demands absolute obedience,\nisolates its members, and controls their behavior,\nnone of which apply to MAGA.\"\n\nIt absolutely controls their information which is cult 101, anything that's not seeing trump positively is seen as fake news. Have u read the trump administration emails? Lots of I love you, your special to me, highly emotional language and look insane to an outsider.",

                            "body": "Steven Hassan is an outspoken Trump critic, and his book The Cult of Trump is more of a political critique than a neutral psychological analysis. If we apply his logic, many other political movements\u2014like Obama\u2019s \u201cHope and Change\u201d or Bernie Sanders\u2019 following\u2014could also be considered cults. Passionate support, loyalty, and emotional messaging are standard in politics; they don\u2019t automatically make something a cult.\n\nThe \u201cus vs. them\u201d dynamic isn\u2019t unique to MAGA\u2014it\u2019s how all political messaging works. Democrats frame conservatives as threats to democracy just as MAGA frames elites and the media as corrupt. Obama spoke about people \u201cclinging to guns and religion,\u201d and Biden labeled MAGA supporters \u201csemi-fascist.\u201d This is just political branding, not cult indoctrination.\n\nMisinformation isn\u2019t exclusive to MAGA either. Democrats pushed the Trump-Russia collusion narrative for years, despite the Steele Dossier\u2019s credibility issues. If questioning election results makes a movement a cult, then what about the Democrats who still claim 2016 was stolen? People interpret facts in ways that support their side\u2014that\u2019s partisanship, not brainwashing.\n\nFear-mongering? Both parties rely on it. Trump warns that America will be ruined if he loses, while Democrats claim democracy itself is at stake. When Trump said, \u201cfight like hell,\u201d it was labeled incitement, but when Kamala Harris said BLM protests \u201cshould not stop,\u201d or when Maxine Waters encouraged confronting Trump officials, it was seen differently. Selectively applying this standard isn\u2019t fair.\n\nAnd yes, Trump has a devoted following, but so did Reagan, Obama, Bernie, and even JFK. Supporters wearing shirts, waving flags, and treating leaders as transformational figures is common in politics\u2014it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re brainwashed.\n\nThe argument that MAGA \u201ccontrols information\u201d also doesn\u2019t hold up. MAGA supporters distrust the mainstream media, but so do many independents and progressives. If refusing to trust CNN or MSNBC is a cult trait, then what about people who refuse to watch Fox News or read conservative sources? People naturally seek out media that aligns with their views\u2014it\u2019s not unique to MAGA.\n\nAt the end of the day, calling MAGA a cult is just a way to dismiss it instead of engaging with why so many people support Trump. If strong loyalty, distrust of institutions, and emotional rhetoric define a cult, then almost every major political movement in history would fit that definition.",

It's pretty easy to label someone a trump critic if they literally write a book on trump being a cult leader! Have u actually read the book? U clearly haven't read up on cults! Of u think Passionate support, loyalty, and emotional messaging are only cult tactics! The classic case of anyone in a cult doesn't believe they are else they would leave! I've been following trumps rise to power since 2015, and when cambridge analytica worked with trump and fb! Specifically targeting voters by using illegal data and bombarding them with disinformation about Hillary . The trump russia collusion isn't misinformation. it's just been conviently called that. The muller report was hampered by Bill Bar ! Have u looked into trump links to russia from the 1980s when he was bankrupt and Russian banks would only lend to him! \nSo the maga who belive trump is literally given to them from god! No one believes demacrates are from god. \nTrump supporters don't trust any source, not from trump, as he has repeatedly told them not to. I'm sceptical of all media, but I haven't been specifically told to not trust media. U can not watch Fox News because you believe it's trumps propaganda arm , but I'm not being told to be a political leader. I'm not a demacrat , im.not american! I think your both parties are courpt . I genuinely believe trump is a threat to democracy, its not fear mongering if it turns out true! Like project 2025 u know the leftist fear mongering untill it wasnt and its literally being enacted! I am aware anyone who is a trump supporter is not going to suddenly decide they have been decived its been years of military grade manipulation.  Do u receive the multiple daily emails? They are insane to an outsider all I love you ur special! And like multiple times a day! Sometimes 15/20 emails a day! I mean there are ex members talking about it! It's not like this isn't widely seen! U can literally Google them! A few have spoken out, too! Just want to add cult members. Don't listen to facts , it's literally part of the manipulation.  A literal part of the brain gets high jacked. So, no amount of explaining is ever going to convince someone who is a maga of being in a cult. In the book, it explains its best to come at an emotional angel . Talk to people about what they thought of trump before 2015 and what they were like before becoming maga , to random people online u don't have that. So I'm under no illusion I'm going to change anyone's mind but I don't feel like it shouldn't be said because of that!",

The \u201cTrump-Russia collusion\u201d narrative wasn\u2019t some undeniable truth\u2014it was investigated for years and fell apart under scrutiny, which is why even liberal media had to admit the Steele Dossier was deeply flawed.

Selectively clinging to conspiracy theories while dismissing counterarguments is exactly the kind of behavior you claim is cult-like.\n\nWhen Robert Mueller was asked during his congressional testimony whether his investigation found that Trump colluded with Russia, he carefully avoided the word collusion (since it's not a legal term) and instead referred to conspiracy. His response was:\n\n\"We did not address \u2018collusion,\u2019 which is not a legal term. Instead, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy, and it was not.\"\n\nHowever, he also clarified that his report did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, stating:\n\n\"If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\"\n\nEssentially, Mueller found multiple links between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia but did not establish enough evidence for a criminal conspiracy.\nRobert Mueller\u2019s investigation led to 34 individuals and 3 companies being charged, including Trump\u2019s inner circle. However, Trump himself avoided charges due to Department of Justice policy that a sitting president couldn\u2019t be indicted.

Sentence commuted by Trump and later pardoned.\n\n3. Michael Flynn (Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser) \u2013 Pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia. Later pardoned by Trump.\n\n\n4. Rick Gates (Trump Campaign Aide & Manafort\u2019s Deputy) \u2013 Pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to investigators. Cooperated with Mueller.\n\n\n5. Michael Cohen (Trump\u2019s Personal Lawyer) \u2013 Pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and lying to Congress. Served time but was not directly charged in Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\n\n6. George Papadopoulos (Trump Campaign Adviser) \u2013 Pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about Russian contacts. Served 12 days in prison.\n\nRussian Agents & Hackers\n\n7. 12 Russian GRU Officers \u2013 Indicted for hacking the DNC, Clinton campaign, and leaking emails through WikiLeaks.

Not quite no evidence! Enough for multiple people in trumps inner circle!!\n\n>And here\u2019s the most ridiculous part of your argument: You\u2019re literally saying that MAGA supporters are so brainwashed that no logic or facts will ever change their minds\u2014which means, by your own logic, there\u2019s no point in even debating this. That\u2019s not a rational position; that\u2019s just intellectual laziness. If you\u2019ve already convinced yourself that the other side is unreachable, then all you\u2019re doing is ranting to yourself in an echo chamber.\n\nMaga won't be all the people and who r not maga might and u haven't specifically stated ur maga so there's hope I guess ! I said specifically the people in the cult won't. I'm not speaking to only maga,  there's also varying degrees of cultness and brainwashing! Some would have voted for trump but not a strong maga supporter.",

First, you argue that MAGA is a cult and that no amount of facts will change their minds\u2014then you turn around and say you\u2019re not speaking to all of them and that \u201cthere\u2019s hope.\u201d So which is it? Either MAGA is full of brainwashed people who can\u2019t be reasoned with, or some people can be persuaded with facts. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nAs for Mueller, you just proved my point. He found links, but not enough to establish criminal conspiracy. You can list all the indictments you want, but none of them were for colluding with Russia to rig the election, which was the entire basis for the years-long hysteria. You\u2019re basically moving the goalposts\u2014now it\u2019s about \u201cTrump\u2019s circle being shady\u201d instead of actual collusion. If vague connections to foreign governments and shady financial dealings make someone a traitor, we\u2019d need to have that same energy for the Clinton Foundation, the Biden family\u2019s business dealings, and basically every major political dynasty.\n\nAnd Cambridge Analytica? Yes, they used microtargeting. Guess what? Every major campaign does it. Hillary\u2019s campaign might have \u201crejected\u201d one company, but Democrats were absolutely using data-driven voter targeting\u2014just not through Cambridge Analytica. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign was praised for its use of Facebook data, but when Trump does it, suddenly it\u2019s \u201cmilitary-grade manipulation.\u201d That\u2019s selective outrage.\n\nYour entire argument boils down to: \u201cTrump bad, MAGA brainwashed, and no facts will change that.\u201d That\u2019s not critical thinking\u2014that\u2019s just reinforcing your own echo chamber. If you\u2019ve already decided that anyone who disagrees with you is brainwashed and beyond reason, then you\u2019re not debating, you\u2019re just preaching to yourself.",

This allegedly terrible problem had a solution ready to go, and at the behest of a private citizen, the entire party flip flopped on the bill.\u00a0\n\nHave we seen Obama, Clinton, or Biden TRY to swoop and poop on a bill as private citizens? If so, did the entire party immediately abandon the bill in fealty to them?\n\nThat is what is cult like about MAGA and that is different from any political movement America has experienced in the past several decades at least.
