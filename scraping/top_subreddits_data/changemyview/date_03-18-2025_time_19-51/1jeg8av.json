    "selftext": "Many people argue that NATO expansion threatens Russia\u2019s security and justifies its aggressive actions, especially in Ukraine. However, this argument does not hold up under scrutiny. NATO is a defensive alliance, Russia\u2019s military doctrine shows it does not truly see NATO as an existential threat, and Russia\u2019s real concerns are about losing political and economic control\u2014not survival. Here\u2019s why:\n\n# **1. NATO is Defensive and Has Never Attacked Russia**\n\nA common claim is that NATO is an aggressive force bent on Russia\u2019s destruction. However, history does not support this.\n\n* NATO has never attacked Russia. In contrast, Russia has invaded or occupied Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and even threatened other post-Soviet states.\n* Examples like Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Libya are often used to portray NATO as aggressive, but none of those cases involved an attack on Russia. NATO\u2019s actions in the Balkans were in response to ethnic cleansing, not an act of aggression against a sovereign country to annex their borders, unlike Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Libya was a United Nations-backed intervention, Russia chose not to veto it.\n* Russia reacted aggressively to Ukraine moving toward NATO but barely responded when Finland joined in 2023. If NATO was the real concern, Russia would have acted similarly toward Finland. The difference? Russia does not see Finland as part of its \u201crightful\u201d sphere of control the way it sees Ukraine.\n\nRussia\u2019s issue isn\u2019t NATO\u2014it\u2019s Ukraine choosing independence from Russian influence.\n\n# **2. Russia\u2019s Own Military Doctrine Shows It Does Not See NATO as an Existential Threat**\n\nIf Russia truly feared a NATO invasion, we would expect its military strategy to reflect that. Instead, Russia prioritizes:\n\n* Nuclear deterrence, which ensures NATO would never dare to attack.\n* Hybrid warfare, cyberattacks, and political interference, aimed at destabilizing rivals rather than preparing for conventional war.\n* Regional power projection, as seen in Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine, which suggests its focus is on controlling weaker states, not defending against NATO.\n\nAdditionally, Russian military doctrine often discusses \u201cWestern-backed\u201d uprisings (like Ukraine\u2019s Maidan protests) as a greater threat than NATO troops. This reveals that Russia\u2019s real fear is losing political control over its neighbors, not military encirclement.   \n  \n*Note: President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an EU Association Agreement, choosing closer ties with Russia instead. Protests grew after police violently cracked down on demonstrators, leading to months of unrest. Eventually, Yanukovych fled to Russia in February 2014, and Ukraine\u2019s parliament voted to remove him. The Maidan protests were NOT a western-backed coup of Ukraine, it was a mass popular uprising, the Ukrainian parliament followed constitutional processes during his removal and there is no evidence the West orchestrated or controlled the protests.*\n\n# **3. Russia\u2019s Real Fear: Losing Influence and Control, Not Security**\n\nIf NATO were the true issue, why does Russia also oppose Ukraine joining the European Union? The EU is not a military alliance, yet Russia has fought just as hard to prevent Ukraine from integrating with it.\n\nThe reason? EU membership would:\n\n* Reduce Russia\u2019s economic leverage over Ukraine.\n* Strengthen Ukraine\u2019s political independence, making it harder for Russia to control.\n* Provide a successful democratic alternative to Russia\u2019s authoritarian model, which could inspire Russians and other post-Soviet states to push for reform.\n\nRussia\u2019s opposition to Ukraine\u2019s EU membership proves this war is not about NATO\u2014it is about keeping Ukraine under Russian influence. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has actually pushed Ukraine closer to both the EU and NATO, proving that Russia\u2019s aggression is self-defeating.\n\n# **4. The \u201cNATO Threat\u201d is Just One of Many Shifting Justifications for the War**\n\nRussia has given multiple excuses for its invasion of Ukraine, many of which contradict each other:\n\n* Denazification \u2013 Despite Ukraine\u2019s Jewish president and lack of a significant Nazi movement.\n* Protecting Russian speakers \u2013 Despite Ukraine not attacking its own Russian-speaking population.\n* NATO expansion \u2013 Despite NATO not forcing Ukraine to join and Russia not reacting the same way to Finland joining.\n\nThe pattern is clear: NATO is just one excuse among many. The real motivation is keeping Ukraine under Russian control, both politically and economically. If NATO was the real concern, why did Russia annex Crimea in 2014, years before Ukraine had any serious NATO prospects?\n\n# **5. Russia\u2019s Nuclear Deterrence Makes a NATO Invasion Impossible**\n\nSome argue that NATO wants to use Ukraine\u2019s flat terrain to rush tanks to Moscow. But even if NATO wanted to attack Russia, it would never happen\u2014because of nuclear deterrence.\n\n* Russia has one of the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenals, making any NATO invasion suicidal.\n* The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has prevented war between major powers for decades, and nothing about NATO\u2019s strategy suggests that would change.\n* Even during the height of the Cold War, when NATO had far greater incentives to attack the USSR, it never did.\n\nThe nuclear argument is critical\u2014even if NATO wanted to destroy Russia, it would never risk nuclear annihilation. The fact that Russia remains fully intact after decades of NATO expansion proves that NATO is not an existential threat. NATO is a defensive alliance and does not place offensive capabilities near Russia\u2019s borders. There are no NATO nuclear weapons in Poland or the Baltics, for example. If NATO were preparing to attack Russia, it would need far more troops, bases, and offensive weapon systems in Eastern Europe\u2014which simply do not exist.\n\nThe idea that NATO wants to invade Russia is pure fearmongering. Russia\u2019s real problem is not military survival, but losing its ability to dominate its neighbors.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nNATO is not an existential threat to Russia. The claim that NATO expansion provoked Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine ignores key facts:\n\n* NATO has never attacked Russia, while Russia has a long history of invading its neighbors.\n* Russia\u2019s military doctrine does not treat NATO as an imminent invasion threat but focuses on controlling former Soviet states.\n* Russia\u2019s opposition to Ukraine joining the EU proves that its real fear is losing economic and political control, not military security.\n* NATO is just one of many excuses Russia has used to justify its aggression.\n* Even if NATO wanted to invade, Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal would make it impossible.\n\nAt the end of the day, Russia\u2019s problem isn\u2019t NATO\u2014it\u2019s the fear of losing its grip on Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. The \"NATO threat\" narrative is nothing more than an excuse to justify an imperialist war.",

It is a large plain and this plain leads directly to Russia's heartland. In addition, from Ukraine one can relatively easily conquer the Volgograd gap. This would cut-off Russia from the Black Sea and the Caucasus. NATO in Finland is also a threat, but Murmansk and Karelia are relatively speaking unimportant if one compares them to Ukraine, they could easily be used as a buffer land until the southern border of Karelia, which acts as a choke point. In addition it is much more difficult to fight there compared to the steppes in Ukraine. Given the same equipment, it is much easier to conquer from Ukraine's steppes than from Finland's tundra/ taiga.\n\nThirdly, if Russia's war went better and/or Russia was in a better economic state, they probably would have made a fuss about Finland too. But since the war isn't going that well, they can't stretch their front line even thinner. In addition, Russia is much less interested in annexing Finland that in annexing Ukraine. Annexing Ukraine, will lead to a massively improved defense.\nAnnexing Finland, will change almost nothing of geopolitical importance. Thus having a war with Ukraine is better from a gain-loss analysis perspective.",

He's said time and time again that the ethnic history of the world is important to him, he likely sees this as a betrayal and an act of disgusting hatred. He might actually believe there was a coup to 'make' Ukraine join the west and that the Slavic people would rather rejoin Russia, but their leaders won't let them. \n\nWe think logically in terms of borders, nations, consent of the governed, mutual benefit. It seems that if Putin believes those things too, he must also believe in something else too in order to be on this trajectory. \n\nSo while they may see NATO as a real threat, they may see Ukraine as a betrayal to be rectified similarly to how we in the U.S. saw the South in the CIvil War as a betrayal to be rectified instead of just letting them leave the Union and begin trade with Britain",

That's what Putin sees Ukraine as doing.\n\nSpeak more clearly, this is incoherent.\n\nIf Russia stood to lose 90% of its territory and all of its nuclear arsenal, this would be an existential threat, because such a Russia would be unable to defend itself against the enemies it has made. The Ukrainian incursion into Russia does not meet the threshold of an existential threat. That's just an ordinary threat, and only a paranoid lunatic could believe otherwise. Putin is not a paranoid lunatic, at least no more than every world leader is. Contrarily, the Russian invasion of Ukraine constitutes an existential threat to Ukraine inasmuch as Russia's ambitions are to neutralize the Ukrainian state. There's the difference. Nothing since the collapse has threatened to topple Russia. The country has in fact been impressively stable since Yeltsin's resignation.",

I'm sure a proper historian would throw a fit, but it's tempting to compare the Bay of Pigs with Crimea in 2014 and everything since as an escalation of Operation Mongoose. Russia might have escalated into a full war over the course of several years, but the US' response in 1962 nearly kicked off WW3 in under two weeks.\n\n\nOf course, for Russia Ukraine is much closer - psychologically, historically - than Cuba ever was. Ukraine was kind-of ruled by Russia already before 1764. For comparison, the US conquered California in 1848. Not saying that the two takeovers are equivalent (plenty of Ukrainian uprisings since) but this is all about attempting to understand the modern-day Russian mentality.\u00a0\n\n\nTo add to that... we're horrified that Russia invades its neighbouring \"sibling\" country (which, from Putin's perspective, has been in an illegitimate state of disarray ever since the Bay of Pigs-esque-claimed rebellion in 2014)... meanwhile the US and its allies wreaked havoc in Afghanistan for two decades. A country, which, again, is essentially Russia's nextdoor neighbour for anyone clinging to the USSR worldmap. Russia invaded Georgia and made a mess of things - so what, even before Bush invaded Iraq because of non-existent WMDs, Clinton imposed mad sanctions that made Iraq a dysfunctional hellhole for no apparent reason.\n\n\nTo be clear, fuck Russia and all it stands for. I'm just trying to paint the what-aboutism picture that I imagine Putin and his followers do. The one where arguing that the US-led world order has the moral upper hand is just hypocritical (which, of course, Triump and Vance is just adding fuel to the fire to).",

You can believe the US totally f\u2019d up relations with Cuba throughout that period, which is how the nukes ended up there in the first place, and modern Russia is f\u2019ing up foreign relations in a similar way with its neighbours now.

NATO serves as a captive market for US military equipment, so admitting Russia with it's massive weapons production capacity would have created competition that the US's military industrial complex didn't want; b.) NATO has no mechanism to suppress dissent in decision making or to expel insubordinate members, so admitting Russia would have caused similar issues to what they've had recently with Hungary. And finally (and perhaps most importantly) c.) Admitting Russia would have made the existence of NATO pointless - what would NATO be defending against? Small local threats, or threats from former Soviet satellite states wouldn't be significant enough to justify the massive amount of $$ that NATO members funnel into it's existence. \n\n3.) So, although publically the concept of NATO was to prevent the expansion of the USSR, it's always REALLY been about maintaining the hegemony of US Capitalist power around the world. Even though the USSR was gone, and Russia was now Capitalist, it was still a competitor and didn't wish to be subservient to US international market domination.",

For a people concerned with 'ethnic cleansing', you sure have little trouble supporting it elsewhere. Like in Ukraine where - and that's the difference to Finland - many ethnic Russians live and let us not forget that the current government was not elected with all of Ukraine. The mostly Russian minority could not participate in the vote. And the pro Russian government was violently ousted by a mob supported by NATO. Where is the democracy in that?\n\nIf that is not a threat, then Idk what is.

            "body": "You state these things as if perception is objective, but nowhere did you give credence to the way Russia sees the world. Nor did you talk about the historic contexts. \n\nThe principle source of the Russian perception is it feels the west is lying about its ambitions. This goes against everything you state as your world view - such as, NATO is inherently defensive. In the early 1990s, hosts of agreements that went directly against Russian interests were predicated on no NATO expansion: German unification, CFE treaty, START II, recognition of Kosovo, Iraq, Libya. And the western promise for economic integration and economic aid was lacking from the promise. \n\nIt also has seen the West engage in regime change incursions. Whether you count Bosnia, to Afghanistan, to Libya, and elsewhere, the capability of the west militarily has to frighten Russia (whether YOU think NATO would invade or not). Russia is a shell of the USSR, and NATO is numerically, technologically, and economically advantage. This means that Russian foreign policy is checked and its sphere of influence greatly shrinks as states want to enter NATO.\n\nIn fact, the New York times in 1998 argued against NATO expansion along these lines: [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/opinion/the-senate-s-duty-on-nato.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/opinion/the-senate-s-duty-on-nato.html)\n\nprominent scholars from Kennan,  Keating, Harries, etc., generations earlier argued that NATO expansion would weaken Russian reformers, make strongmen more popular as they have an easy boogeyman, and will encourage Russia in military action. Yet, we act like the present day came out of nowhere.  The leading thought a few generations ago showed that Russian improved economy would push back on the US's unipopular military dominance on its borders and it's what it did in Georgia (2008), Crimea (2014), South Ossetia, and Ukraine.\n\nThen we haven't even gotten into the fact that Putin could fear the real threat: Democratic-forced regime change. The political revolutions of Georgia and then later in Ukraine (similiar to the Arab spring) threatens Putin's hold on the country as revolutions are contagious.",

I am not arguing that NATO is a security threat to Russia; I am arguing that it is understandable why Russia views NATO as a security threat to itself.\n\n1. It is illustrative to acknowledge why NATO and the Warsaw Pact were formed in the first place. They were alliance blocs created primarily to oppose each other. The Soviet Union was obsessed with having buffer states as far from the Russian heartland as possible after Operation Barbarossa, which remains the single largest invasion in human history. \n\nThe amount of deaths and atrocities inflicted by the Nazis and the Soviets during the Eastern Front in World War 2 left cataclysmic generational trauma/paranoia. This obsession with distance from the border is why the Soviets crushed early attempts at freedom from communism, ala Hungary shortly after World War 2.\n\n2. Putin is absolutely obsessed with what he calls the \"Kosovo Precedent.\" Kosovo was a province in Serbia that was unilaterally backed by NATO's military might without a UN resolution that was allowed to declare itself independent against Serbia's protests. Remember that Russia helped trigger the diplomatic crisis leading to World War 1 with its insistence that it protect Serbia from Austria-Hungary. \n\nRussia was furious that a breakaway province (whatever the justification) of an existing state was allowed to declare independence, backed by military might. Putin cites the \"Kosovo Precedent\" for shielding breakaway provinces with majority Russian demographics from Georgia/Crimea who unilaterally declare independence. There is no indication that he does not believe Russia was tremendously wronged and threatened by the chastisement of Serbia. \n\n3. The start of the \"Color Revolutions\" is when Russia-NATO relations really started to sour. As we now know, Color Revolutions were movements either incited by or strongly supported by US intelligence agencies that spread western style democracies in post-Soviet states. Russia was and is terrified by this. Consider it from their POV: what is the functional difference between NATO protecting Kosovo, a \"breakaway province\", declaring independence from a protesting Serbia and CIA fomenting a \"Color Revolution\" to help an anti-Russian government take over and start persecuting Russians within its borders, all the while being protected by NATO?\n\nRemember-- Russia is not a western style liberal democracy. They view the change in governments from pro-Putin states to liberal democracies the same way we would view Germany or Poland adopting Russian-style Putinist regimes. \n\nThis was not viewed as a problem for them when they viewed Ukraine as a friendly country. With Ukraine aligned with NATO, however, they feared they would lose access to Sevastopol, their biggest naval base and one of their few \"warm-water\" ports. If you know anything about Russian history, you know they are also obsessed with having warm-water ports. Losing their biggest warm-water port would be viewed as an existential crisis for them, similar to something like the Straits of Hercules being closed to NATO maritime traffic, hence why they \"Kosovo'd\" Crimea.\n\nRussia's viewpoint makes sense if you realize they view being governed by our government with the same horror that we view us being governed by their government.",

In Libya (2011), NATO airstrikes helped take down Gaddafi, but instead of peace, Libya turned into a lawless mess. Back in Bosnia (1995), they bombed Serbian forces to force an end to the war. And let\u2019s not forget NATO members\u2019 roles in Iraq, Syria, and beyond. Whether it\u2019s direct invasions, regime changes, or endless bombing campaigns, NATO has no problem using military force whenever it feels like it. They frame it as \"keeping the peace,\" but time and time again, their interventions leave countries in ruins. If you think NATO won't find an excuse to invade, you're way too naive.",

The result? Libya collapsed into chaos, warlords took over, and slave markets popped up. If that\u2019s \u201chelping,\u201d I\u2019d hate to see what harm looks like.\n\nAnd Yugoslavia (1999)? NATO bypassed the UN and bombed Serbia anyway. Whether or not it was \"justified,\" it was still a military alliance attacking a sovereign country. If Russia did that today without UN approval, we\u2019d call it an invasion, because that\u2019s exactly what it was.\n\nNow look at NATO\u2019s track record, they\u2019ve invaded, bombed, and overthrown leaders whenever it suited their agenda. If they wanted to take out Putin, they\u2019d find a reason. They justified Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia, and countless other interventions, so why would Russia be any different?

Breaking Yugoslavia ensured Western control over the Balkans and weakened Russian influence in the region.\n\nAfghanistan? A 20-year war justified by terrorism, but what came with it? Strategic military bases near China and Russia, control over opium production (which skyrocketed under NATO occupation), and massive contracts for Western defense contractors. The U.S. may have eventually pulled out, but for two decades, NATO powers reaped economic and strategic benefits.\n\nNATO interventions have never been just about \"protecting civilians.\" The pattern is clear\u2014regime changes that secure economic and geopolitical advantages for Western powers while leaving the invaded countries in chaos.

Full invasions all?  No, but Europe has been a security concern for Russia for centuries and, thanks to geography and the relatively small size of the Russian ethnicity, their response has been to plug the gaps in the natural barriers that allow invasion so they can fight in narrow spaces instead of open plains (think the Battle of Thermopylae at a continent level).  This is why lasting peace in Ukraine is going to be very difficult without a collapse of the Russian military.

            "body": "Your argument illustrates a common framing found in Western discourse: it presumes NATO\u2019s intentions alone define whether Russia feels threatened, ignoring historical context, geopolitical realities, and how great powers typically behave.\n\nFirstly, you argue NATO is a defensive alliance because it has never directly attacked Russia. But the essence of international politics and national security is not determined solely by past actions or stated intentions. Security threats are perceived, not merely objective. If we reversed the scenario\u2014if Russia had expanded a military alliance across Latin America or Canada, stationing missile systems and troops near U.S. borders\u2014would the U.S. accept assurances of peaceful intent? Certainly not. Security threats are fundamentally about capability, proximity, and the strategic imbalance created\u2014not solely about intentions.\n\nSecondly, your focus on Russia\u2019s stated military doctrine misses the underlying strategic logic. States perceive existential threats not only in terms of imminent military invasions but also as long-term strategic encroachments. From Russia\u2019s perspective, NATO\u2019s expansion into historically neutral or buffer states\u2014particularly former Soviet republics\u2014represents an erosion of strategic depth and geopolitical autonomy. The Russian concern is precisely the threat of a Western-aligned Ukraine that could host future offensive capabilities, even if NATO currently does not place them there. Ignoring this point neglects the broader strategic calculus that any great power would make.\n\nThirdly, you correctly note that Russia opposes Ukraine\u2019s integration with the EU, an ostensibly non-military organization. But that only reinforces the point: Russia\u2019s perception of threat extends beyond NATO. It is fundamentally about preserving regional influence, stability of its border regions, and avoiding being encircled by Western-aligned states that would constrain its sovereignty and autonomy. NATO is only one part of a broader geopolitical contest involving political, economic, and military dimensions. Arguing exclusively whether NATO is defensive or offensive reduces the complexity of international relations to a narrow and overly simplistic frame.\n\nFourthly, you suggest nuclear deterrence makes NATO invasion impossible, hence invalidating Russia\u2019s fears. Yet this again misunderstands threat perceptions. Nuclear deterrence does not erase the threat of conventional encirclement or political isolation. Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal ensures survival, yes\u2014but survival alone is not the only concern of states. Russia\u2019s real existential anxiety lies in losing strategic autonomy, geopolitical relevance, and influence over its periphery\u2014conditions historically viewed by major powers, including the U.S., as critical to national security.\n\nUltimately, your framing implicitly adopts a moralistic, rather than strategic, view of international relations. You interpret Russia\u2019s reaction as imperialist aggression while seeing NATO\u2019s expansion as morally justified defensive alignment. Such moralism obscures the fundamental geopolitical logic: powerful states, regardless of their stated intentions, react defensively when rival military alliances encroach upon their historic spheres of influence. By failing to recognize this dynamic, your argument misunderstands why Russia genuinely perceives NATO\u2014and broader Western encroachment\u2014as an existential threat, even if NATO itself has not and would not directly invade Russia.",
