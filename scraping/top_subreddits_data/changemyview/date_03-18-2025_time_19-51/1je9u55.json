    "selftext": "I\u2019m a 32 YO woman. I\u2019ve spent most of my life living in a bubble. I moved to the UK a few years ago to do my master\u2019s degree, and I\u2019m now working here full-time. Before that, I\u2019d never worked a day in my life until I was 29. This is my third year in the workforce.\n\nI come from a wealthy background, definitely the top 0.1% where I\u2019m from. I grew up in a third-world country but went to a boarding school in Australia and then international schools all the way through university. Coming here, I wanted to meet new people. Since I\u2019m Asian and look quite young, I\u2019ve made friends with some much younger people, third and fourth-year university students who thought I was their age. I\u2019ve also connected with random adults I probably wouldn\u2019t have socialized with back home.\n\nFor the first time, I\u2019ve been exposed to a very \u201cleft\u201d view of the world. I know younger people tend to be more political and judgmental, probably because they haven\u2019t had to carry many real-world responsibilities yet, but I\u2019m often shocked by how much they infantilize both themselves and other adults. Many of them talk about how mature they are, yet in the next breath say things like, \u201cI\u2019m still a baby!\u201d or \u201cMy prefrontal cortex hasn\u2019t fully developed because I\u2019m not 25 yet.\u201d Totally made me go what the eff?? Then there\u2019s the constant narrative about older partners being predatory because of the supposed \u201cpower imbalance\u201d due to age and finances.\n\nThe world I grew up in was very different. Many of my guy friends had parents who own Ferraris and Lamborghinis and other supercars that they could take out for a drive anytime. (Keep in mind, taxes on cars in our country are 300%, so those cars can easily cost \u00a3500k.) Almost all of them own their own sport cars. These guys were literal f\\*\\*\\*boys. At 19-20, they were competing to see who could date and sleep with hot older celebrities, mostly for fun or status. They\u2019d \u201cscore\" the girl, brag, and then move on. They were trophy girlfriends and I never converse with them because I know they wouldn't last very long. My friends definitely exploited and used the hell out of those poor older ladies (by older I mean like 7-13 years older).\n\nAnd those women? They were often chasing these guys for their wealth and the  lifestyle, luxury gifts, glam trips. Remember one my friend's dad (a politician) bought him a birkin bag so he could gift it to his girlfriend, one of the top 3 actresses of that time. We were like wtf, but ok. And these top actresses in the country followed my friends around like house cats. Nobody cared about age gaps because we held the power, even when we were young. We could buy our way into everything and, frankly, often had more control over 99% of the older people than they had over us. People that could scare us are probably our parents and our friend's parents.\n\nWhen I was 20-23, I had older men hit on me, some 10 years older, and it didn\u2019t bother me at all. I had just as much money and status as they did. I never felt powerless. I was already an adult, capable of thinking for myself. If someone tried to gaslight me, I\u2019d figure it out eventually. I wasn\u2019t a naive child; I was in university, writing papers and expected to think critically. I never saw myself as a baby. Sure, I was more prone, but when your parents already gave you everything you need, you care less about a guy and what they can give you. I would say the most manipulated boyfriend was the one who was my age at the age of 18-20. A drug addict, a gambler, pathological liar, total disaster and manipulated me way more than the older men I have met later on in life.\n\nLooking back, I was probably naive in some ways, but not because of my age. It was because of the trauma from being gaslit by my own parents. That made me vulnerable, and it still does sometimes. Even now, someone pretending to be kind could easily manipulate me. But there are plenty of 20-year-olds out there who aren\u2019t gullible like this at all probably.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen plenty of younger women chasing my guy friends in their 30s, professing love when it was obvious they were after the money. It was the same dynamic: people hunting for someone they could take advantage of. Some of my friends were gullible enough to believe that, so whatever. But for me to look at these girls and think they are prone to manipulation? No, many of these are the manipulators themselves and they knew \"exactly\" what they were doing. I treat everyone who is above 20 years old as adult. Infantilising yourself at that age is comical. \"THESE GOLD DIGGERS YOUNG GIRLS LITERALLY TARGET OLD MEN FOR MONEY!\". They are not getting exploited, they were looking for a ticket out of poverty. Say again who is the victim? none. They are both consenting adult exchanging what each other wants.\n\nOnce, I dated a guy here in the UK who came from a working-class family. He was six years younger than me and extremely left-wing. I just wanted to try and be open-minded. We eventually broke up because our worldviews were just too different. He constantly made snide comments about everything I bought, saying I could afford it because I was \u201colder\u201d and \"more successful\".  I shut that down quickly. When I was 21, my annual allowance from my dad was more than his family\u2019s total household income. It had nothing to do with my age. His father had been working for 30 years and still earned less than 10% of what I make now. They can work their entire life and it won't reach what I have in trust funds, so you all can keep being delusional that \"age gap is like the biggggest cause of power imbalance\". If you have a better financial power you are much less likely to cling to dear life to a toxic relation. Age is a part of the equation, but it's not the main one. The biggest is still financial power in my opinion.\n\nYou could put 99% of older men in front of me 10 years ago and I\u2019d probably still have more financial power than most of them. So no, it\u2019s not an age thing. It\u2019s a socioeconomic thing. Me and my friends learn how to exploit the system and people at a younger age because we know what actually hold the true power in this world.\n\nI barely see racism in a board meeting full of old, young, wealthy educated black, gay, middle eastern, women, whatever you're going to name it. Once you're there, you're there.  It's almost comical really how most people are so infatuated with these \"age\", \"gender\" issue, when the true oppression is actually the wealth gap.\n\nBut it keeps a lot of people busy I believe.\n\np.s. Don't even get me started on intellectual imbalance. An illiterate 50 years old working class definitely wont be able to hold a proper debate and outsmart an undergrad from Oxford.",

I don\u2019t believe that you can correctly picture the power dynamics of a social circle where everyone is middle-class or lower-class. (This is not a judgment of you as a person by any means \u2014 I just know how far apart these worlds are.)\n\nBeing wealthy comes with a lot of protections. It\u2019s far harder to become ostracized from society. It\u2019s far less likely that law enforcement doesn\u2019t take you seriously. When wealth is removed from the equation, power imbalances can form much more easily. Someone\u2019s gender, age, skin color, and access to a secure income become looming factors.",

So yes, if a girl is relying on them financially, it's hard to walk away.\n\nBut I can make the same argument for the guy \"their age\". Manipulator exist in all sort of age range and  even if you date someone from your own age, if you're naive or gullible enough, you will get manipulated by anyone. Switch those \"older men\" to \"younger men\", equally toxic with the same financial status (rich or poor), a naive person can be manipulated by both. Young male are also atrocious by the way.\n\nat 20+ year old I believe any male are capable of manipulation given they hold better financial status to the girl, doesn't have to be 40. Predator? Pedo? keep these words for an actual  underage people and not 20+ year old. 20 year old is an adult.",

Power dynamics exist in every relationship in one way or another whether its financial (a PhD dating a blue collar worker), intellectual, or neurodivergence related. Yet society doesn't apply the same standards to those cases or even mention those cases at all.\n\nFor example, \"Emotional maturity in individuals continues to develop until around the age of 35. This process can be slower in people with ADHD, a**nd they may not reach the level of emotional maturity of a 21 year old until they are in their late 20s or early 30s.**\" By this logic, relationships between neurodivergent and neurotypical people could also be seen as \"sketchy\" or imbalanced. But no one makes that argument just like no one questions an older woman dating a younger man to the same degree just classic misandry though it could be also seen as misogyny since it practically infantilizes young adult women.\n\nThe reality is that societal perception varies in my country, no one would honestly care beyond making some jokes. The assumption that every age gap relationship is predatory is a cultural bias, not an objective truth. If this argument were consistent, it would apply to all relationships with any form of power difference not just when the younger person is female. On top of that, this argument doesn\u2019t even make sense in a legal or societal framework. We already set adulthood at a certain age, and people still complain. If we changed it to 21 instead of 18, those same people would just move the goalposts and claim 21 year olds arent mature enough either.",

These young, rich, good looking, well educated men are more dangerous than many older guys. They hold all the power, be it intellectually, physically, wealth, age.

You said:\n\n>Looking back, I was probably naive in some ways, but not because of my age. It was because of the trauma from being gaslit by my own parents.\n\nThis is half true, but you are being too precise and losing the general trend for it. To make it more general: You were naive due to not yet having the experience to correct that naivete, based on your specific prior experiences. Different people at that age will have different blind spots, based on their specific prior experiences, but almost all of us will have *some* blind spot. With more time, you get more experience and you can fill in those blind spots better.\n\nAnd for many people, those blind spots are in a context that makes them easier to manipulate in a relationship, because they just haven't seen how it can turn out badly yet.\n\nA few quick caveats of agreement: Yes, modern US/UK culture overinfantilizes young adults. Yes, young people can also be manipulative themselves, and same-age relationships can also be toxic/problematic. Yes, other power imbalances also exist and yes, wealth is at the top of that list.\n\nI think the reason people look down on age-gap relationships so much is that they have a hard time imagining any reason for these relationships to exist *apart* from one of these imbalances. It may be for wealth, or experience, or both together, but what does a \"normal\" age-gap relationship look like? It does exist, but it's sufficiently uncommon that the current western generation just doesn't have any context for it.",

They may have been just as personally problematic at age 21, but by age 41 the people around them have noticed they are problematic and stepped away. So they pick up new 21 year olds that haven't yet learned to recognize those danger signs. And since most 41 years olds in US/UK are *not* doing that, this makes those creepy predators stand out even more to the rest of us.\n\nAnd unfortunately that translates to social distaste for the non-predatory 40 year olds who might randomly meet a 21 year-old they can be friends with, so it creates a feedback loop. The fewer people who do this, the more pressure there is for people to not do this.",

No one thinks being a stupid egotist is an excuse. They think being young and inexperienced is an excuse. Being old and experienced is a different state. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite state of being young and inexperienced and the cause of the imbalance.\u00a0\n\nThe point is, a 45 year old man knows what he is doing when he chooses a 19 year old partner. They both may well think the other loves them, but you select a 19-year-old because they will be pliable and easily controlled because of your worldliness and experience.
