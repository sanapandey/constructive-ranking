The Trump administration is poor at communication:\n\n* Nations and people share more information with one another when they\u2019re pissed at the same entity\n* The United States has shown a lack of decorum in dealings with world leaders (e.g. France, Canada, Ukraine, etc.)\n* The United States government has regularly demonstrated a lack of professionalism (e.g. government officials engaging in trolling; \u201cowning the libs\u201d)\n* The United States regularly ignores its agreements with other countries (e.g. Budapest Memorandum; Iran nuclear deal; Paris Climate Accords; etc.)\n\n  \n3. The Heritage Foundation, in reshaping the American government, created indefensible intelligence vulnerabilities via the execution of Project 2025:\n\n* No intelligence gathering entity, friend or foe, is going to wait passively while you restructure your government and talk trash about their leaders and their countries\n* Targeting minority groups (e.g. immigrants; trans people; etc.) increases social tensions, victimizes loved ones, and creates dogged enemies\n* Nontraditional vetting practices create nontraditional threat vectors\n* Mass dismissal/resignations of competent and experienced rank and file personnel make it easier to attract, and harder to detect, bad actors\n* Moving fast and breaking things makes it difficult to spot a nefarious actor who\u2019s breaking things just to break things\n* A lack of checks and balances on the president forced him to be the single point of failure in the system, has rendered the libs impotent, and caused conservatives to be overrun by grifters who perpetuate misinformation",

                            "body": ">The non-Trump part of the Trump administration is susceptible\n\nI assumed \"Trump Administration\" in this context meant his political appointees. The overall system, say for instance security clearances, etc., have safeguards to not allow people that are blackmailable to have certain positions.\n\nIt's that Trump has overriden these systems to put his cronies in - like Kushner in the last administration. That's why I thought it's fair to limit the scope of my response to reflect where the risk of blackmail is the highest given the other safeguards within the non-Trump government. \n\nFor example from the last time around: [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-officials-are-asked-if-they-are-vulnerable-blackmail-n848456](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-officials-are-asked-if-they-are-vulnerable-blackmail-n848456)\n\nThat's why I think that this time is different since he started with the more reprehensible picks. How is anyone going to blackmail Tulsi Gabbard when we already knew she's a foreign agent? How is anyone going to blackmail Pete Hegseth for being a woman abusing drunk? Why would any foreign government black mail the people who are permanently and irreperably harming America's economic and soft power? \n\nThese dumb dumbs are doing exactly what the Kremlin wants. Why would they stop that?",

At this point, people who are signing up to be in Trump's orbit know exactly what the risks/rewards are. I am speaking of the selection bias that's necessarily happening.\n\n>The lack of qualifications among Trump appointees is going to cause them great stress\n\nOnly if they are the kind of people who are capable of things like shame. But, say, Michael Cohen, for instance, would never dream of getting the kind of success he had in conventional routes. Trump is attracting the people for whom being a kiss ass is their only hope for the kind of positions he's putting them in.\n\nIn the first administration, when you had run of the mill GOP operatives who are in it for \"love of the country\" can get black mailed. In this administration, it's just grifters and idiots and foreign plants.\n\n>Maybe I should've used the term \"fleeced\" rather than \"blackmailed\"\n\nYou just can't convince me that Tulsi Gabbard would even be capable of being fleeced or blackmailed when she's doing what the Kremlin wants her to do be doing. \n\nWhat you're not taking into account is the risks of foreign adversaries - the actual people who come and do the espionage - take on when they try to do the blackmailing. They don't have any incentive when Trump himself is either a willing stooge or already compromised. \n\nThey don't have to interfere when the people Trump is putting in positions are already irreparably harming America's soft and economic power. You don't have to blackmail Flynn when he's already on the payroll. You don't have to blackmail Ivanka and Jared when you could just bribe them.\n\nThat's what I'm saying: It's so much easier to get willing stooges and/or bribable people than to use blackmail.\n\nOn top of that - people have to have a base of knowledge to be fleeced. The Trump administration is filled with people who either believe in Trump or have no beliefs and sell out to the highest bidder.",

My entire counter point is that there's so much rampant corruption from the top down that you don't need to coerce them; there's officials that are ideologically committed to hurting America's soft and economic and military power, or they're willing to take a bribe that coercion isn't necessary.\n\nFor god's sake, Trump was caught with the most classified information that the government has and it appears he was selling it to the highest bidder. People seeing this man and wanting to work for him don't need to be black mailed. \n\nIn fact - we know that Republican billionaires give gifts to decision-makers. We know that SCOTUS, who isn't even in Trump's orbit, is easily bribeable. It's part and parcel of the conservative movement. That's why it's a counterpoint to the OP, which was that they're susceptible to blackmail, when they will sell out for bribes.",
