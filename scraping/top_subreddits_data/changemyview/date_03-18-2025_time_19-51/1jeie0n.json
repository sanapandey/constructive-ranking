But also, many are not. \n\nBecause there's the other side of the coin: Many good people can't sleep at night if they're not doing their best to help. They'd rather take on the pain and suffering because morally, if they don't do it, other people will do it worse. \n\nAnd they do suffer for it. But they march on because it's the right thing to do. \n\nNot everybody has the mental fortitude of a depressed 25 year old working a dead end job, unable to step up into tougher jobs because it would crush them (no offense if I accidentally described anybody here). A lot of us walk TOWARDS the tough situations and towards the added responsibility. Because unfortunately, we do have the fortitude to keep going so it's our moral responsibility to take it on.",

Because you say that being one of these leaders leads to some kind of mental disorder or psychotic break. Do we see that regularly? Like to presidents, prime minsters, and party chairs regularly commit suicide or get hospitalized for insanity?",

Empathy is instinctual, you\u2019re either born w it or not to varying degrees. Sympathy is learned, you can always learn to be a good person. And no I\u2019m not a sociopath I\u2019m just autistic, and many others on the spectrum have a lack of empathy, and that does not stop them from having a proper moral compass.
