    "selftext": "I'm looking for a convincing explanation for the decision made by Schumer, Gillibrand, Fetterman, et al in joining Republicans on passing the stopgap bill. \n\nIdeally some insight on maybe the technicalities of what the bill is compared to a mpre comprehensive budget - are they going to fight harder come the end of this stopgap bill? \n\nI need something far more detailed than \"Trump and Musk could do more if Govt were shut down\" - how, specifically, and by what mechanisms, and how would that be worse than their attempts to do roughly the same already? \n\nI also want to know, as a follow-up, if this wasn't a good enough reason for Dems to use what is roughly their only real leverage in the minority - the filibuster - what is? When will they use it, and why then and not now? \n\nIf you tell me that the reasoning is that voters would blame Dems for the shut down, then you'll need to explain how this (https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3921) is wrong: \n\n>If a government shutdown does occur, 32 percent of voters say they would blame Democrats in Congress the most, 31 percent say they would blame Republicans in Congress the most, 22 percent say they would blame President Trump the most, and 15 percent did not offer an opinion.\n\nEven if all 15% undecideds suddenly turned on Dems, that still doesn't match the 53% who would blame Trump or Republicans. \n\nAlright. Somebody change my view.",

So the Dems in the House - at least according to this argument - can vote \"no\" on this thing with less immediate weight of the outcomes, since it has to also pass the Senate. There's maybe less perception that they are \"causing\" the risky outcomes since the Senate is like a buffer for it all. But when the Senators vote, that's final. That's what's going to happen. So he's saying many of them felt the gravity of that, and maybe that made it harder for them to vote \"no\" than their House colleagues.  \n\n>So there seem to be unique downsides to passing the bill while the negatives were the same regardless.\n\nWell not exactly. Right now, as Trump and Musk try to dismantle stuff, Dems can bring their lawyers to challenge them in the courts. In a shutdown, the executive has broad, extra authority to close or bringup organizations by, typically, calling it an emergency. This makes sense when we're dealing with good faith actors, but it would create - as Whitehouse said - a \"veneer of legality\" to what Trump is currently doing anyway. Whether that veneer would ultimately help Trump more or cause his actions to backfire seems to be the divide on this particular bill.  \n\nAnd in fairness to the weight of it all, this is a continuing resolution bill for 6 months to the end of the fiscal year, this isn't the full proposal that Mile Johnson is working on in earnest with perhaps trillions of dollars in cuts.  \n\nSo, perhaps Senatr Dems will have a sturdier spine when the real cuts get on the voting bloc.",

Is even making a push worth the risk of Trump rolling his eyes and signaling to the representatives to just shut it all down on a whim?\n\nThis is all hypothetical, and exaggerated.

This is also bad for the dems. \n\nNow heres the reason why the dems signed the bill. Since it is now passed and is law, the dems can use the courts to dismantle a lot of it. They can challenge everything and reduce the damage. When a new cr has to be signed in 7 months they will now have more leverage because the republicans will see that the dems will fight every single line item in court. \n\nSo if the dems signed the bill they can fight it in the courts, if they didnt sign the bill everything gets gutted and they cant fight it and have no leverage next time.

Hell, DOGE is basically actively fighting to do most of what a government shutdown would do permanently.  \n\nSo in a lot of ways a government shutdown would have given Republicans what they wanted, \"smaller government,\" but instead of us being to blame all the suffering on DOGE, they would (disingenuously) say \"we wanted to keep funding the parks and social security but those meanie democrats with Trump Derangement Syndrome when and shut down the government because Trump was owning the libs so hard.\"",

                            "body": ">but in this case it seems most people polled *know* that it would be Republicans to blame for it,\n\nIn this case, that is not likely correct after the fact.\n\nThe house passed a largely clean CR with a couple minor annoying provisions that weren't anywhere near a poison pill. A shutdown would have been blamed on the Democrats in this specific case once the House bill was passed on the 11th but killed in the Senate. The poll you linked to PUBLISHED on the 13th (1) Would have gathered most of it's respondents before the largely clean CR was passed by the House on the 11th and (2) Does not take into effect the post-shutdown messaging that would happen, and the way this played out the narrative would favor the Republicans.\n\nAn alternative strategy to not pass the CR and impose a shutdown would have to had the groundwork laid weeks ago with the Senate Minority loudly screaming that they will not pass a simple CR even if it manages to pass the house without clear limits on DOGE power or some other set of understandable and ideally popular provisions... so that then if the CR is passed without it then the Senate Minority can accuse House Republicans of bad faith and kill via filibuster. Then they might be able to win the post-shutdown blame narrative. Even then the strategy is iffy, and would depend on a rapid Republican capitulation to not cause a lot of people a lot of pain.\n\nAs it was, the Dems seemed to think the House Republicans would fight among themselves again and not be able to get a CR through. They were wrong.\n\nAgain, at the risk of repeating myself, the poll released on 13th (polling taking place in the 5 days before most likely) did not fully take into account the Republican lead House passing a mostly clean CR in the middle of the poll period. Many of the 'blame republicans' may have been acting on feels, or on the assumption that the House would fail to pass a clean CR or would encumber the CR with an obvious poison pill.",

I think it\u2019s most likely that Trump\u2019s popularity will have peaked in his first weeks in office, and will only decline over time.  Facing growing unpopularity 6 months from now, Democrats may have more leverage over the next shutdown purely from a clearer swing in public opinion. Certainly they had the opportunity to limit more damage by fighting tooth and nail at this time (I would only assume things will be worse in 6 months), but I think they have a higher chance of winning concessions in 6 months than they did this week.",

Musk would not be able to pay to keep the government running either, as he's simply not rich enough. Then Democrats could demand stuff like USAID back up and running, IIJA funding restored, and so on and so forth, before they'll vote for a continuing resolution. Without the CR, there's no money for e.g. ATC, which means eventually those workers start calling in sick or finding new jobs. It took two weeks last time, because pilots will not fly without ATC and nor will stewards and stewardesses. And when Americans can't fly because Republicans won't negotiate with Democrats, then there will be leverage.\n\nNow though? Now all those agencies ***are*** gonna get cut, slashed and burned to the ground, and by September, there won't be any e.g. USAID to restore. It'll be gone, no matter how much Congress tells Trump to do what it used to do (it may already be gone). By the time the next continuing resolution comes along, there may not be much of a government to shut down, and certainly nothing they can leverage against Trump.\n\nAnd the budget still won't matter.\n\nSo why on earth should anyone who care about any non-MAGA agenda vote for Democrats?

Power has been consolidated in the executive branch yes, But Wilson, FDR and Johnson did this, not trump.   You're identifying a problem correctly but blaming the wrong criminal.\n\nNotice how they're named \"The department of education\" not \"The congressional department of education\"  and \"The Department of the interior\"  not \"The congressional department of the interior\".\n\nThe president effectively controls an unelected shadow legislature by making laws (sorry, \"Regulations\") and simply saying \"They're regulations congress says we are allowed to set\" and congress is happy with this state of affairs because it makes it harder for the public to react to their voting record, becuase they can just pass bland omnibus bills and blame the president when something goes wrong, and keep their safe cushy jobs.",

The filibuster is only used and leverage itself when you have something to gain from using it. Me pointing out you just lost the election is why this is defined as the first 100 days. There isn't a legal term or period when we let the president's do what they want, but the leverage is all in their favor because they JUST GOT ELECTED. It's not about giving them time, it's about you have empirical proof that it will not help, but HARM you idiot. The filibuster is typically used midterm to do the most damage but cook queen, you clearly know wtf you're talking about since you named the wrong person and purpose. McConnells filibuster was effected when he finally did use it, because as stated before THEY CONTROLLED THE HOUSE. Obama losing the house meant the filibuster could block the vote. Republicans control both right now, your filibuster wouldn't block the vote, just piss people off idiot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump did win the popular vote btw, he just won a plurality not a majority.

Why does that eliminate the leverage in the Senate to be able to filibuster? The Republicans falling in line took away *House* Dems' leverage, not the Senate. And yet, they still all voted against it anyway (all but 1) in a rare show of unity for the party.

Again, polls already showed people would blame Trump or Republicans more than Dems. Midterms *usually* swing away from incumbent president's party. Trump's aggression on the federal government - cutting jobs, canceling contracts, etc - is already backfiring in the public's eyes, an even more aggressive cutting of programs and departments could reasonably lead to even more backfiring as people turn against him, realizing that their vote wasn't to literally dismantle the government.",

It would also show a great deal of courage and unity for Dem and independent left-leaning voters, that Democrats are willing to unify and fight against the regime however they can, even if it is risky.",

The Democratic leadership today were young during the \u201cRegan Revolution\u201d and tend to be of the faction that believed that Democrat\u2019s support for unions cost them support from business and made them a weaker party in the 1980s. Since Clinton on, the goal of the Democrats has been to become the \u201cnicer\u201d Regan party. Obama and the woman they picked for Trump\u2019s state of the union rebuttal both cited Reagan. The Democratic establishment is operating under this logic and so they will not oppose Trump\u2019s pro-business moves, they will try to triangulate on some culture war stuff while also trying to seem more reasonable than the Republicans. People like Gavin Newsom seem to think that the future of the Democrats is being the \u201cnicer\u201d MAGA party.",

After all, the Conservatives tell us that they don't believe in government and that government doesn't work. When they fulfill their prophecy rarely does anyone call them out for tipping the scales. Because actually the people who want to see government brought down think they're getting their way, tribal idiots blame Democrats, and the few who are left largely don't trust the Democrats to do sensible things that governments actually do with the government (regardless of actual record).\n\nIf the Democrats can find any sort of deal, they're probably best taking it while it's simply horrible because they're going to be under pressure to come back to the table. The Republicans can keep flipping tables every step of the way. If that deal doesn't work out, they can just make a shittier one, and the Democrats will be under even more pressure to enable something just to bring the government back. If that doesn't work out, they can make one even shittier.\n\nWithout political consciousness from the American people, the Democrats get screwed every time. The only way they get out of this death spiral is if suddenly the Democrats believe in just fucking shit up to prevent the Republicans doing what they want. But they don't, and there is no solidarity behind anything, let alone a political party to ensure that anything happens.",
