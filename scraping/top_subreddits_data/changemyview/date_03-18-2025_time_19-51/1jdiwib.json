    "selftext": "As an American, I simply see no way that this administration ends without some sort of cataclysm one way or another.  The options I can think of:\n\n1.) Trump decides he wants more time in office and attempts to subvert democracy (again), and is overthrown. This leads to a full civil war between his supporters and his non-supporters.\n2.) Trump invades some country (Panama, Greenland, Canada), and starts world war 3.  \n3.) The DOJ starts considering anyone critical of the current administration as a terrorist, and starts sending them to re-education camps.  \n4.) The government is dismantled to such a degree that results in mass protests and potentially rioting.  \n5.) The gutting of environmental protections leads to a deep water horizon level environmental catastrophe.  \n6.) Someone tries to take out the president again and possibly succeeds, leading to a civil war.  \n7.) The administration uses nukes on Iran as a pre-emptive strike.\n\nLots of options that I can think of.  Some more plausible than others, but it's hard to see how one or more of these does not occur over the next 4 years.  I would love to be proven wrong.",

We very well could see several more years of battles between the court system and the president, and as time goes on more and more individuals in the Republican party start to shift away from Trump, further limiting his ability execute well, anything. \n\nMost politicians want to stay in power. The second they think that going against the president is going to gain them more voters than supporting him, a large percentage would seriously consider changing their support and pull a McConnell-like \"this individual is dangerous to our nation\" viewpoint.",

The messaging needs to do a lot of laundry already, and there's substantial risk that future scandal in any Trumpian agenda will increase.\n\nI also don't know how 2026 will play forward.   Imo, Trump has already committed acts commensurate with impeachment.   But that doesn't seem to matter anymore,  right?   Gah.\n\nAnyways,  tldr: Trump is speed running cuz the clock is ticking.",

In a climate of political aggression?\n\n/1.  Priori:  Trump will continue pushing norms.\n\n/2.  In order to insulate themselves, *some* R house members will begin Murkowski'ing,  wafting vague \"concerns\" and trying to place themselves in a \"whelp, maybe lessons have been learned\"\n\n/3.  Trump et all will build a messaging framework to punish/primary any RINO's.   I dunno...\n\n* Loyalty!    \n* The differently gendered immigrants coming to DESTROY AMERICA!  Giant convoys of Mexicans from Gaza and Venezuela! \n* the Antifa Urban DEI hires are going to forced bussing into LOCAL AREA area public schools!\n* the Molotov Ribentrop Minerals deal in Ukraine is good for America!\n* China!   The Corona virus death jab lockdowns!\n\nEtc.\n\n/3 Look for Trump to make more big deals with industrialists, tycoons.  Including the freshly desanctioned Russians.   More is good, because in addition to grift, expanding the donar class war chest affords TrumpCo more options on tepid feet Rs.  If you got $, primary any R who raises up.  Bury them on friendly media.  Trump's got Twitter, Zuck can be moved, Trump might already have or can get TikTok in pocket.  That''s a lot of socials.  He's got Rogan, Tucker already.  Kirk.  Brosphere.   Make Tate the Secretary of Manliness.\n\n\nOr simply just buy them out!  Stephanik, Vance,  they both experienced a \"come to orange jesus\" moment and are now ride or die.  I imagine more than a few R congressmembers can be offered a golden handshake to help them on board the Maga Train.  $5 mil?  Elon can afford $5 mil a congressmember with all the starlink contracts coming his way.\n\n/3a  don't think that Ds are safe from incentives.  Look for more Sinemas.  If Stephanik can be moved, why not Misc D as well?  Even just to add the one more pearl clutching D who thinks maybe we shouldn't overreact!  Like, for example, Fetterman is sus.  He's not likely to be a long term Senator, and after getting attacked, that's slowed, he's now being unusually \"moderate\".    (I don't have a good read on fetterman, he's always been different, but some of his moves are strange)\n\n...\n\nFlipping the house, imo, while likely, is *insufficient*.   I think an impeachment is likely.  But if it's a kabuki impeachment, that won't stop the orange train.  The first impeachment (imo, well grounded and legit) was \"too wonky\", (I'm wonky, don't @ me) ... full of esoteric legal theories and ambiguities.   A snore fest for the low info crowd.   \n\nBut the second?   Trump STFU'd after the second.  He *actually changed behavior*.  That's interesting.   Imo,  he was in real jeopardy,  but the polls shifted, the temperature dropped, the pace slowed, the messaging did the laundry.   \n\nIf I was an anti Trumper, and I am,  I would be preparing, gathering and collating groundwork, background, for an impeachment for any of the reasons that are likely.   *bribes*.  *conflicts of interest*.  \n\nIf I was a media watcher,  keep an eye out for consolidations.  Trump cozying up to Zuck was interesting.   Troubling.  Fetterman being sus is interesting.   \n\n... enough rambling.",

Strictly speaking, things are not that bad yet to where they can't convince themselves that everyone else is just exaggerating the problems, and surely it will all get better within 6 months before they personally face any serious problems. It costs them nothing to declare that they would gladly pay $10 per egg just to kick out all the immigrants when they don't seriously believe it will ever happen.\n\nBut if things do actually get that bad, if current trends don't just magically reverse themselves in the next couple months, then we might get to see which among them are the true believers and which will have cold feet after they personally start suffering more than they can ignore. I think more of them have limits to their loyalty to Trump than they care to admit, though I'm not sure in practice how useful this will be when Trump is stuffing the government full of his own stooges, and if these people are still more afraid of the hypothetical Democrat boogieman than the things Trump is openly doing in front of them. Maybe some non-MAGA Republicans will grow a spine if they're no longer as concerned about getting primaried by a MAGA opponent. Or maybe they just switch to a new populist with the same policies but less public controversy.",

The evidence that he was flagrantly and willfully evading turning over documents, in stark contrast to Biden and Pence's immediate aquiesence, was staggering. The grand jury  that indicted him even had 2016 Trump voters on it. \n\nBut Ted Cruz, who should have his law degree rescinded, went of Fox and called it a hoax or a witch hunt, I can't remember which. \n\nThen a judge he appointed made a ridiculous ruling that anyone who isn't blindly partisan disagreed with. That invalidated 50 years of precedent of using special prosecutors. By her ruling, Ken Starr wouldn't have been able to prosecute Bill Clinton. Had he not been reelected, the courts would have struck that decision down as nonsense. But the courts moved slowly as a necessity of justice. He took full advantage of that. Normally I wouldn't take issue with that at all, but the American people didn't get to hear that case. \n\nJudge Canon gave him just enough time to get reelected, forstalling justice entirely, and she'll probably get a Supreme Court seat for it.",

Feel free to give counterexamples.\n\nI also genuinely wanted to know what your issue with DoE was. It wasn't deflection.

They litteraly changed the law so he could be charged if that's not a clear sign of political prosecution I don't know what is. It wasn't a criminal trial because there was no actual evidence a crime happened just one person saying something happened on a date she couldn't even remember. That's really something to hang your hat on? You hate Trump and want him to be a criminal so you are just eager to belive anything. If you looked at any of it with the smallest amount of skepticism you could see how his supporters would take these trials as dems just railroading him trying to brat him with the law because they were afraid of an election.\n\n\nI don't know what you think could have been done better with COVID. The actions taken by Biden are even debated wether they were effective against a respiratory virus like COVID. Many of the precautions were not based on science but just doing something to be doing something. Trump probably did the only thing that actualy mattered for people with comorbidites,\u00a0 he funded the creation of the vaccine.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't even like the guy, didn't vote for him the first 2 times but after watching dems do this with the legal system I chose to vote for him the 3rd time. Do I like what he is currently doing? No but dems need to know what they did was wrong.\u00a0\n\n\nThe US lost a million people largely due to the fact that this country is full of sick people to begin with. Most of the people who died had several comorbidites. Maybe if one of the administration's told people being fat and lazy was a death sentence with this virus and actualy used the fear to motivate people to do something healthy more people would have lived.",

Here's what I'll say. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong I'm not a Trump supporter in the 2016 sense of the word where he can do no wrong. This election was the first time I voted for him over legitimate concerns of our last administration. All that being said, I'll admit I could be wrong. I doubt it. If I am That's part of what the second amendment is for.\n\n2 - he's the first president to not start or fund any new wars in his last term. Now you're inevitably going to bring up any bombings he did or the recent houthi rebel situation. None of his actions were in new wars but were all actions started under the Obama administration and they were limited military actions. He's not going to start a war with Canada, Greenland, or Panama. The 51st state comment can be mapped to him threatening tariffs (because Canada places tariffs on us), Trudeau calling Trump an idiot and Trump joking about making Canada the 51st state. Trudeau was on his way out so he capitalized on it. Greenland is about getting resources. The Panama canal is due to the alignment with China on Panama's part. He's not starting a war with any of these countries. He's negotiating. If any of these countries started a war with us it would not be world war 3. It would be the US military fucks you. A war with Russia or China would be World War 3. Our last administration seemed to want to provoke Russia by wanting Ukraine in NATO. Even that didn't happen. That was a much more grave situation by giving zelensky the green light to attack inside of Russia using our weapons which require our personnel and systems after Kamala lost the election. Still, we didn't actually go to World War 3 because Trump was taking over. I would argue he's keeping us out of wars with his actions.\n\n3 - Honestly, this one I get a bit. I'm going to tell you the bad news though. Look at what happened to anyone critical of the last administration. The precedents were set under Biden and should really teach people that we should allow free speech. People were censored by the last administration, had their lives ruined, and a few lost their careers over speaking out against COVID restrictions and other things. Let's hope this doesn't happen but give them an inch they take a mile and the rules apply to the next administration. \n\n4 - I don't get how the Government are actually the good guys now. I also don't get how the left has become this pro war and pro invasion of privacy. The cuts that doge is trying to make would take the budget to 2017 levels. That isn't enough for anarchy and chaos. Wild but he's actually proposing cutting the DOD which a few years ago was the let's wet dream.\n\n5 - If this happened under Trump's term it wouldn't be because Trump cut regulations it would be because it's been building up for years just waiting. The cuts to protections may not matter anyways. One solution might be to buy a Tesla but unfortunately nobody wants to now. Another solution might be to ask the billionaires championing the environmental protections to stop flying their private jets and just deal with first class on an airline since private jets cause way more pollution than just about everything. Another solution might be to support local businesses rather than the big businesses that cause real environmental issues specifically in factory farming. There are also a lot of pharmaceutical companies that have their waste less regulated that is a problem as well but everyone seems to think the pharmaceutical companies are the good guys now.\n\n6 - Yeah the extremes on both the left and the right are nuts enough to cause this unfortunately. Hopefully you know how to shoot. As someone who spent the majority of their time on the left (despite what most of this post sounds like) the one thing I always supported was the second amendment. Hopefully the rest of the left understands this now and as a side note everyone should be on board with the second amendment now if they're that concerned Trump is the second coming of Hitler. Just saying.\n\n7 - Highly doubtful. There's a ton of reasons but I'll start with the left friendly one. Putin has too much power over Iran so he would never allow it so if we're expected to believe Trump is Putin's bitch (which I don't but you probably do so here's your logic hole) then Putin would not allow such a thing to happen. Maybe a few surgical strikes but nukes are off the table with Iran. Now, what I actually believe is that Trump knows that's a bad idea and would strain relations with Russia but I wouldn't be surprised if Trump did something to Iran because they are funding terrorist activities against Israel and the houthi rebels that are attacking our ships in Yemen.\n\n\nSo I see concerns in a few of those that are legitimate but most are not.",

The machine is really good at rent-a-riots. Certain controversial government agencies actually used to brag about their rent a riots on the website. That agency is being closed, so the people there would certainly have the current administration on it's enemies list. I wonder if there is any connection to what we're seeing with protests / riots against Tesla.\n\nAside: Instead of using Deep Water Horizon, I think you should reference how we blew up Nord Stream. Even though this didn't get any press on the environmental side (especially compared to deep water horizon), I think it had a much greater environmental impact (at least for those of us who believe CO2 emissions are bad).",

There couldn't be a civil war, the left has no one physically able to fight. They would lose within a month. \n\n2. Do you have any evidence to suggest his could happen?\n\n3. ok and how would that cause any problem for trump? You didn't say how this would be a problem.\n\n4. Again, so? What does this have to do with what you're claiming? Americans are used to democrats being degenerates, we saw the BLM riots. The difference this time is trump would use the NG to shut them down and Americans would love it.\n\n5. Government agencies are the ones who cause these issues. Look up Gold King Mine disaster or Flint, Michigan water.\n\n6. Again, see 1. There is no side to fight against for there to be a civil war. \n\n7. And? How would this be trump's problem. You didn't say.",
