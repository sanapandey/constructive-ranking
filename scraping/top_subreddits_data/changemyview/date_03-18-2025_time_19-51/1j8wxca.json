    "selftext": "Hello friends! We're looking to expand our team of volunteers that help keep this place running. If you're passionate about changing views through thoughtful discourse, what better way can there be to contribute to that than help to keep a community like this as a smoothly oiled machine? We're not looking for a fixed number of new moderators, generally we like to take things by eye and accept as many new mods as we have good applications. Ideal candidates will have...\n\nA strong history of good-faith participation on CMV (delta count irrelevent).\n\nUnderstanding of our rules and why they're setup the way they are.\n\nPlease do note though:\n\nModerating this subreddit is a significant time commitment (minimum 2-3 hours per week). It's rewarding and in my opinion very worthy work, but please only apply if you are actually ready to participate.\n\nThank you very much for making this community great.

There's room to have a busy life and sometimes step away, as long as you're putting in the time in the medium/long run. \n\nAnd it's a pretty good crowd of mods! Very supportive and collaborative, even when we disagree. I definitely encourage anyone interested to apply - we can totally use the help!!",
