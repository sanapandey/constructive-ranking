    "selftext": "You see it every day and everywhere- on social media and in real life\n\n\u201cIf you voted for Trump, you are racist/homophobic/stupid/terrible human beings\u201d\n\nAny time someone who did vote Trump attempts to explain why they did, or what they do or don\u2019t agree with in terms of policy positions and current actions, they get accused of being dishonest about \u201cwhat they *truly* care about\u201d\n\nThis was the line the media and party Democrats took, repeatedly painting wide swathes of the electorate as deplorable and hateful- and we can see clearly it didn\u2019t secure them victory.\n\nMy view is that as long as this attitude continues of assuming all Trump voters are a monolith of evil liars and refusing to consider that their stated concerns are legitimate (even if they are wrong) the Democratic party will continue to lose support and government seats.\n\nEDIT: People seem to be getting hung up on the name calling thing but ignoring the main part of my point, which is that you can call them all the names you want but unless you UNDERSTAND WHY they voted the way they did, no ground will be gained.

Feel free to check my other replies on this very thread, just because I disagree with republicans doesn't mean I don't think they should be taken seriously.\n\n>That hasn\u2019t been their strategy tho has it?\n\nWhose strategy? The democrats? It hasn't, that's precisely my point. I don't think either side cares as much about the language as they do about what politicians are actually doing. I think acting like conservatives would change their minds if the democratic party used magic words is infantilizing, if democrats implemented policies that improved the material conditions of their constituents and communicated that clearly I think there would be republican voters joining them all on their own. The reason republicans don't vote democrat is because they aren't offering them things they want.",

When you entertain the discussion as having inherent merit you've already fallen for the trap of propaganda, because then you're stuck in a back and forth where no positive outcome can be gained. The better course of action for all involved is to highlight how unproductive that is and then address the core of the issue.\n\nAn extra advantage of this approach is that if someone is making civility arguments in bad faith you're screwed, but if you address the actual issues and concerns people have it doesn't matter if someone is trying to be bad faith or not, which means we can approach them with charitability, and that's always an advantage.",

They won in 2016, gained House and Senate seats in 2020, and won again in 2024. So why is it that this aggressive approach seems to work for them, but when Democrats criticize Trump voters, it\u2019s suddenly \u2018bad strategy\u2019?\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about calling people names.

They positioned themselves as \u2018the only ones who see the truth\u2019 while branding everyone else as corrupt or un-American. And yet, despite using the exact rhetoric that Democrats are told to avoid, they\u2019ve still been politically successful.\n\nSo the real question is: why is one side allowed to win using these tactics while the other isn\u2019t? If Democrats are expected to be polite and avoid alienating voters, but Trump\u2019s movement thrives on demonization, doesn\u2019t that suggest the issue isn\u2019t just \u2018effective messaging\u2019 but something deeper about the way the electorate is conditioned to respond?\n\nAnd more importantly - if Democrats did take the gloves off and fought with the same aggressive messaging that Republicans do, would they actually lose support?

My theory is that the left primarily sees people as groups and the right sees them as individuals.

It is possible that some people make less money this year, even if median income increased. It\u2019s possible that you got a raise, increased your 401k, and feel worse off economically. \n\nAll of those things are possible, right? (I\u2019m actually asking, I don\u2019t know if you understand that). \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of reasons why that could be. One of the reasons is because thats how economic numbers works, literally, that\u2019s just a principle of mathematics when trying to find these numbers. Another reason could be because the economic metric isn\u2019t actually capturing what is impacting people. Another reason is because everyone but you is stupid. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of reasons why that could be true, some more likely than others",

If I\u2019m a democrat, I\u2019ll be asking \u2018Why\u2019 and not call them names.\n\nMost people voted for Trump because of economical issues, and Democrats couldn\u2019t form a counter argument to that message and that\u2019s what caused them the 2024 election. \n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be afraid of gaining red states or votes, look at Obama\u2019s campaign for example, he was heavy in the community good or bad, republican voters didn\u2019t agree with him on several issues, but he didn\u2019t call them names or insult in any. Most of his attacks were humorous in nature, like \u2018Don\u2019t boo, vote!\u2019, adding the fact he was charismatic and that\u2019s what Democrats are missing, a charismatic leader.\n\nInstead of trying to play the name-calling game, try to take away votes from Republicans who have already lost everything: jobs, homes and families. Show them that if Republicans cared, Trump wound not be golfing right now (I don\u2019t think he even visited the disaster areas from the recent tornado outbreak). Sometimes, playing into the strategy of name calling is childish, they need to meet these people and learn from them. \n\nWhat changed in their lives that made them switch political parties? Has anything that they deem important been resolved? Remember, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. If we name call every single Trump voter racist, then messaging is clearly the problem because not every Trump voter is like that.",

Need to flex your market muscle on the world stage? Tariffs! Want to address immigration? Deport! Is there a bird flu causing eggs to skyrocket? No! We're just in an era of TikTok politics where peoples eyes glaze over when you get into any depth in regards to policy.\n\n\nDems just don't have the same messaging because left siding people want traditional politicians. Dem leadership is either blind or unwilling to accept that Trumps messaging works, for better or worse. They're also super quick to turn against more modern politicians like AOC who challenge the status quo. Trump's also got the backing of the wealthy elite who want lower taxes at any cost, elites who own almost all the news and social media outlets and will make sure that message is heard loud and clear. And, unfortunately, you can't run establishment politicians against a populist firebrand, especially when incumbents are getting spanked globally.\n\n\nIt's often been said that we get the government that we deserve, and I'd say that this is absolutely true if you look at the admin and their kneejerk policies as it relates to all the short form media we consume. Lots of folks out there expect the economy to be completely turned around in 4 years, have no concept of global economics, and are so quick to punish the presiding party when the other side gives a direct but unrealistic solution to a problem that they insist only they can fix.",

He was banned from Facebook, Twitter, instagram, youtube interviews etc. He literally had to create a website to be able to put his message out. Russia lies, lawsuits, ridiculous criminal charges etc. It was all free media for him, and the media essentially got together to try and get him to loose. Well, it backfired. Literally in the last 9 months, the dems lost everyone from joe rogan, rfk Jr., Zuckerberg, and their hero, elon Musk,  Comedians, etc, that all switched sides this year. Trump won despite the media going AGAINST him, and imagine how much he wins by if the main media was not so biased to the left. A lot is ratings based also etc. The media is not for trump, he just is a master at marketing, and I know ima get down voted. But look at his results is obviously true",

Negative stories about Trump are a win-win as a news outlet. You get engagement from the left who want to read about all the things he's done, and you get engagement from the right who want to jump in to defend him. The actual slant of his coverage literally does not matter.\n\n\nLet's also factor in all the technocrats front and center at the inauguration. Those people weren't there for no reason. Fox News, the most undeniably right leaning mainstream channel, has the highest viewership of the big three news channels, and CNN recently appointed Mark Thompson as their CEO who wants them to move more right.\n\n\nSo don't put words in my mouth. I did not say that Republicans own all the media. I said that the people who own the media are almost all wealthy elites interested in keeping their hordes as large as possible and since Trump is a path to that end, they're fine with amplifying his messages and sanewashing his gaffes.",

Why would Americans be homeless and starving with Trump in office when we were doing better economically during his last term and that was during a pandemic of which he had no control over. \n\nWhen the democrats and bidens admin have literally thrown millions and millions of our money to absolutely laughably ridiculous things like condoms in Gaza? Oh and they were even funding the freaking taliban. \n\nSo yeah i think a lot of us are at the point that anyone is better than a democrat because their party has fallen to corruption; and if theyre in office; America will fall to tyranny. If we fall; its only a matter of time before the rest of the free world follows suit. The current dems are evil; and cant be trusted. They only say theyre fighting for certain stances that people want to get votes yet once they get in office; none of it is done; and instead they do shit behind the scenes that can only translate to their desire to destroy the country. Otherwise why are ppl on the left still fighting and arguing over the things that democrats campaigned and got elected for time and time again? And why would we have proof of all the corruption? \n\nHonestly I doubt ill ever be able to vote Democrat ever again because its too risky.",

I could copy and paste your comment, change a few words to fit the opposite narrative (like socialism to fascist), and I think it would be more accurate. \n\nI am a three time Trump voter, and I try to stay informed when it comes to national politics. Nearly all of my family and friends are conservatives/republicans. None of that messaging resonates with me. \n\nCan you give examples of the conservative message of evil democrats and leftists? I don\u2019t often hear that messaging. Some for sure, especially around certain topics like abortion or hormones and surgeries for gender dysphoric minors, but not generally around most topics.  \n\nThe conservative voices I see and hear the most are Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk, Megan Kelly, Dave Rubin, and some others. I don\u2019t have any stats to support this assertion, but I think these are the most listened to conservatives out there right now. Each of these folks generally rely on arguing why they are right and the other side is wrong, which is what politics should be. I hardly ever see them projecting the other side as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Even then, it is generally that the result of certain actions are dangerous, rather than the person or party with the idea. \n\nOn the flip side, I could turn on nearly any mainstream democrat or leftist program and hear racist, nazi, authoritarian, fascist, sexist, homophobe, bigot, etc accusations all in the same hour of programming. \n\nOr I could scroll through Reddit for 5 minutes and see that same rhetoric in nearly every corner of this website. \n\nI think the left has been far more accusatory when it comes to projections of evil and dangerous intentions. Most of the Biden/Harris campaigns weren\u2019t \u201cthis is why we are right and they are wrong\u201d. It was \u201cTrump is evil. Not only wrong, but evil\u201d. Outside of the campaigns, the liberal media certainly pushed the evil Trump narrative as often and loudly as possible. \n\nTrump himself is the closest mainstream conservative that I think fits your description. His combative rhetoric is the thing I like least about him. And he certainly makes frequent accusations of incompetence and stupidity, but even from him I don\u2019t think he often projects dangerous or evil intentions onto his opponents.",

If the national sales tax is to be a full replacement, everything would be hit.\n\nThe exemptions that are listed in the bill actually benefit higher earners *even more*, with things like investments and business expenses claiming exemption. \n\nThe national sales tax is, by design, the opposite of a progressive tax rate (where people pay a proportion of their income); the more of your income that goes towards material purchases & services, the more burden you carry. Even if exemptions were made for goods like food, they would still need to shoulder an unequal burden to meet an equivalent standard of government funding.",

It\u2019s like anytime they get grassroots movement, they have to shove it to the side before it implodes, then they lose the grassroots \n\nIt\u2019s like, over the last 8 years, I literally can\u2019t think of a leftwing slogan that hasn\u2019t turned into a dumpster fire for the left wing to manage.",

None of them are based in reality, but that doesn't really matter. people can vote however they want for whatever reasons they want.\n\nDonald Trump is working very hard to dismiss civil rights, amplify white males, delegitimize transgender people, make homosexuality illegal, make it easier to molest children, remove workers rights, transfer wealth to the top 1%, eradicate education, give official government support to Christianity, keep families in poverty, destroy healthcare, and deport undocumented immigrants to detention centers with absolutely no oversight. These things are facts, and there is a massive amount of data to support each of those statements. You can disagree, but you'd have to show how he is not in fact doing those things against all the evidence (mostly his own statements) that he is.\n\nIf you can ignore all that because you think you're going to pay less in taxes (you won't), then yeah. You come off as a fascist, homophobic, transphobic, religious white supremacist. You're welcome to dispute any single statement I made. \n\nI don't doubt that you didn't vote thinking he was going to do any of those things, despite all evidence to the contrary. But if you still support what he's doing then you quite simply do not care about your fellow citizens. People are literally dying due to Trump's policies.

But when Democrats apply the same standard\u2014labeling Trump based on policies rather than personal declarations\u2014you suddenly demand an impossible burden of proof.\n\nSo before I even entertain your question, answer mine: Why is it fair to call someone a Marxist for favoring regulation, but unfair to call someone racist or authoritarian when they push policies that disproportionately harm minorities?",

I have tried for years now to understand their reasoning for voting for a fascist and tried to share my perspective on why that is a bad idea. But after all that . . . They still just voted for trump again. And honestly the reasoning behind those votes, in terms of the people I know, is exactly what you\u2019d expect. They voted for trump out of bigotry and utter ignorance, and they have had their minds completely poisoned by propaganda. I\u2019m fucking tired of being \u201cnice\u201d while they ignore everything I say and continue to vote for trump regardless. If I hear a really good idea on how to convince trump voters to change their politics, I\u2019m very open to it. But after the last decade I really feel that most of these folks are way past any appeal to reason, and I don\u2019t think their minds will be changed by anything including the loss of our American democracy",

There's a whole lot more that needs to be added actually like the cats and dogs incident. \n\nBut I suppose if he didn't explicitly say something like \"I hate all black people\" then you'll say he's not really a racist. Strange how proud white supremacists love him. \n\nAnd this isn't even touching his misogyny. \n\n>Even assuming he\u2019s racist blindly saying all of his candidates agree with everything he says is absurd.Do you support your parents?\n\nSure. But you're not electing your parents. You're electing a president who has the power to enforce the law against you. Their beliefs on race have massive consequences on the whole country. \n\n>Biden said that if you don\u2019t vote for him \u201cyou ain\u2019t black\u201d where he discredited any minorities who didn\u2019t unilaterally agree with him. \n\nAnd that was a shitty thing to say. He got in trouble for it and rightfully so. Dems don't tolerate that crap. Republicans do. In fact it seems to be the selling point that launched Trump's political career. \n\n>Ah you think the dude with face paint and Viking mask who was an idiot for not understanding trump blatantly saying \u201cpeacefully and patriotically\u201d protest was a legitimate threat to the democracy of the United States.\n\nHe was part of a mob who broke in after attacking the police for the explicit purpose of stopping the certification of the election. So yeah. By definition, he's an insurrectionist. And Trump did say to go peacefully... after saying that if they didn't fight then they won't have a country anymore. \n\nHe's always talked out both sides of his mouth. That doesn't absolve him for his actions. His actions in the months before the election and during the attack (which was nothing for hours into the attack- a dereliction of his duty) show what he really wanted. Same with pardoning the attackers. That's what makes him a traitor. \n\nThe left pushing past the police barriers was wrong. But nobody got hurt and they were arrested (and rightfully so). If a politician encouraged those actions, then they should be held accountable for that just like Trump should be. As far as I know, there weren't any. \n\n>His policies are meant to hurt bad people yes, \n\nAh, that's where a person's beliefs about race come back in. Who is defined as \"bad\" is in the eye of the beholder. We're already seeing this play out where people who are here legally are being deported and they're being labeled terrorists for exercising their 1st Amendment rights. \n\nAll of this was foreseeable for a voter. Trump and his political supporters explicitly said they wanted to do these things and you decided to put him into a position where he could actually act on them. \n\nThat's why we call you racists. This is what you wanted isn't it? The only alternatives are that you didn't care or you are easily fooled. Either way the outcome is the same.",

If there were not any qualified black women, maybe you can say picking an unqualified candidate because of her race and gender was racist, but there are and he picked one.  Again, you're here implying that Harris isn't qualified, but in fact you didn't mention her resume or lack of qualifications at all.  The GOP has never run anything but a white man for president in 200+ years - is that really so much better?  Is a white man just, by default, the 'most qualified' Republican POTUS candidate?\n\nDo you think Trump's cabinet members were selected for their competence, experience, fit?

It's been studied for decades, there are CONSISTENTLY studies that show the same resume will be more likely to receive a callback with a white/male sounding name than a black/male or female sounding name.  DEI literally only exists because race and gender have traditionally been MAJOR factors in hiring.  Hope you like the nepo babies, because they were something DEI was specifically there to combat.\n\nHarris was the only presidential candidate that had ever worked in all three branches of government.  When she was tapped to be VP she'd spent 7 years as the DA in one of the biggest American cities, 6 years as Attorney General of the biggest state in the Union, and 4 years as a Senator from that same state.  There is no coherent argument to be made that she was not qualified to be Vice President.  Certainly the current guy isn't half as qualified, but I have yet to have an anti-DEI person say that - wonder why?\n\nYes, I assume a resume (meaning the experience and skills a person have) should be relevant to whether they are qualified to do a particular job.  Is that at all controversial?  Are you really here arguing against DEI and also saying that someone's experience and accomplishments shouldn't play into the hiring process?",

Nate Silver had always been a big booster of Polymarket, which in turn is driven by the betting activity of a relatively small population of overly online degenerate gamblers with politics addictions who all really like Nate Silver. This created a problematic feedback loop for Silver *before* he officially aligned with Polymarket. Although it wasn\u2019t announced until the summer, Silver\u2019s collaboration with Thiel seems to have begun shortly before the FTC proposed new regulations which would further restrict the operation of Polymarket and other electoral betting markets which coincides with Silver\u2019s amplification of the narrative regarding Biden\u2019s cognitive fitness; Polymarket election odds were influential in internal efforts to push Biden aside as the summer went on and Thiel and Silver amplified the message (despite Trump\u2019s obvious cognitive decline which went wholly unmentioned). This culminated in the donor revolt leading up the the weekend Biden stepped aside.",

Dems like you will vote blue no matter who, the apathetic and 3rd party voters (and a huge chunk of \u201cDems\u201d like me, are begging for someone who isn\u2019t a hand picked Corporate puppet. \n\nYour idea of what Dems should do has proven to be helpful in bringing Fascism to power. Maybe Bernie or someone else with a populist approach, integrity, and a proven track record would lose, but we won\u2019t know because the DNC would rather have Trump than someone who isn\u2019t beholden to them. \n\nI\u2019m almost always the \u201cradical leftist\u201d on whatever jobsite and I\u2019ll give you this anecdote: I work with all types of people but the majority are Republicans/MAGA and non-voters who felt that neither Harris nor Trump were worthy of their votes. Of all the people I\u2019ve spoken to about politics in some form or another, virtually all of them respect Bernie Sanders. Most do not agree with  his policies but they acknowledge his track record and genuine desire to make things better. Guess what people say about Harris or Biden? Guess what Democrats say about them? \n\nAnecdote obviously but I think it\u2019s probably pretty close to the case across the Country. People want Populism. MAGA/Republicans speak more kindly about a \u201cSocialist\u201d than they do about watered down Republicans because they despise establishment politicians. \n\nObviously I don\u2019t expect MAGA/Republicans to vote for a Bernie Sanders type candidate but the apathetic/3rd party sure would. Surely more than voted for Not Trump. There\u2019s no downside to moving farther Left. Dems are useless and they don\u2019t win elections. And I said this in 2016 but it\u2019s a thousand times more relevant now- What is there really to lose here?",

I\u2019ll play your game. \n\nI would argue that the infrastructure bill was a benefit to many American communities as an investment into our aging infrastructure was long overdue. It was something promised and long-touted by Trump (remember Infrastructure Week?), but never seriously undertaken. I would bolster my argument that it benefits Americans by how many republicans are taking credit for projects in the districts that are funded by the bill they voted against. I\u2019d also argue that it benefits people because now Trump is putting his name on signs for projects funded by a bill Biden signed. \n\nI would argue that Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness, which largely made good on a promise by the Bush administration on loan forgiveness for public service workers (they passed a law promising loan forgiveness and then denied a vast majority of legit applications for loan forgiveness) was a huge net positive for America. \n\nI would argue that the expansion of the Child Tax Credit, which cut childhood poverty in the country by half before it was killed by all republicans and Manchin/Sinema was a huge benefit for American families. \n\nThere is more, but for the sake of brevity I would also say that the CHIPS act is a positive for American communities and achieves Tump\u2019s stated goal of bringing manufacturing back to America without his tariff whiplash destroying American companies. \n\nSo there you go. That\u2019s four things that I think clearly benefit Americans. Now it\u2019s your turn. Either provide some policies or prove you\u2019re just trolling by moving goalposts.",

Again you refused and played an Uno Reverse telling me that I should be the first one to name things the Biden admin did that I thought were good for America.

For what it\u2019s worth, I actually think that the First Step Act, INSPIRE Act, and Operation Warp Speed were great things his administration were a part of in his first term. I think no tax on tips, overtime, or social security are great proposals if they are real\u2014there is some real concern that hedge fund bros would restructure their compensation to be considered \u201ctips\u201d so they pay no taxes, but I think untaxed tips for service workers is a great idea. I think our health and insurance systems need a massive overhaul and if Trump ever actually presented a plan, I\u2019d be open to it. Likewise I agree with him that the American worker has been screwed over the past 60ish years, but I haven\u2019t seen anything from him or his team that would fix that. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more, but I need to go read to my kid for bedtime. I\u2019ll give him credit where I think that it is due, it just seems that most of the positive things he says he\u2019s for is smoke and mirrors and a real, concrete plan never materializes. \n\nStill bothers me that you didn\u2019t have one positive thing Trump did to post until 2 hours and a lot of back and forth.",

The primary political strategy of Democrats has been to move increasingly to the right and to treat even the most ridiculous of statements and gestures as within the mainstream or as worthy of the benefit of the doubt. \n\nEven outside of campaigning this is what Democrats do. Witness the Senate rubber stamping the Republican budget, which basically just tells Trump and nusk to do whatever they want. Consider that the primary Democrat response to Musk's two Nazi salutes was the pretend that he didn't mean to do them!\n\nThat is what has gotten us to where we are today, and doing more of it would be stupid. Op's characterization of Democrats exists only in fantasy. I would say that if Democrats were actually that way we might be a little bit better off because Democrats who had the stones to speak that way might also be the type to fight back.",

Kamala [campaigned with republican Liz Cheney](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/liz-cheney-campaigns-with-harris-in-pennsylvania-painting-trump-as-a-dangerous-choice), in spite of how hated she is on the left. All these things were meant to appeal to moderate conservatives, but she made no gains with those demographics while losing young people and leftists [which data shows are becoming the new base of the party](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/06/26/facts-about-democrats/).\n\nI'm not sure you're right that mainstream politicians have been running around insulting their conservative constituents, but even if such stupidity could be stopped I don't think there's any evidence conservatives are interested in what the democratic party has to offer. Conservatives aren't that superficial, in spite of what liberals claim, they do care about the policies they support, and they don't want leftist policies. We could argue about why that's the case, but as things are they don't like the democrats because the democrats are not offering things they want in their representatives.\n\nSo it doesn't seem like appealing to moderates on the right has been successful, and it came at the cost of lower turnout for core demographics in the party. If democrats want to win elections it seems obvious they should appeal to the people on the left who have disengaged because they see the democratic party as nearly indistinguishable from the republicans. If they got young leftists to vote in large numbers they'd sweep, and they've been much more successful at activating that demographic than they've had winning over conservatives in spite of spending hundreds of millions on the latter.",

It's someone who has been given actual power in government, during a time when anti-semitism is high given the situation in Israel and Palestine* is giving a seig heil on National TV.\n\nFor him to be trolling means he would want people to recognize it as a seig heil. And he gave no consideration to how that might, I dunno, make anti-semites feel even more emboldened to attack Jewish people?\n\nThe \"trolling\" argument is obviously made up gaslighting nonsense. Musk was comfortable with giving a Nazi salute on national TV. He was comfortable tweeting that the Holocaust was caused by public service workers and not Germanys leadership. He was comfortable retweeting Nazi sympathizers. \n\nAt some point, it becomes irrelevant what his actual views on Jewish people are. If someone is *that* comfortable hanging out with Nazis, comfortable being associated with Nazis, then they are pretty much a Nazi.\n\n\n\n*Note, I am not suggesting criticism of Israel is automatically anti-semitic. I am saying that anti-semetic opportunists have used this situation to attack Jewish people.",

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, for their many many flaws, are both people with long careers in politics in which they\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated that they\u2019re committed to doing their jobs in good faith. Voting for Joe Biden in 2020 was not something I was excited to do. I didn\u2019t vote for him in the primary and I\u2019ll grant you that his main selling point for me was that the alternate was Trump\u2026.but there were fact-based reasons to vote for Biden that weren\u2019t Trump-related.\u00a0\n\nEven if you do no other research and purely just listen to Donald Trump speak, it\u2019s abundantly clear that he knows nothing about the laws and politics of the country he\u2019s campaigned to lead and has no intention to learn. This is a man who governs by Tweet (or by posts on his own social network after he was kicked off Twitter) and changes his policies abruptly and without good reason or regard to the effects of his ill-considered moves on the citizens of this country. He surrounds himself with incompetent yes-men, whereas Biden filled his cabinet with people who politically opposed him in the primary. Donald Trump\u2019s claims to be good for the economy have repeatedly been demonstrated to be false. There is no fact-based reason to vote for Donald Trump beyond white nationalism, and to compare him to people like Joe Biden (or if you like, to John McCain or any other actual career Republicans) is intellectually dishonest.",

I don't know that it's fine I just meant it was an issue for Harris because it's hard to imagine her securing the nomination if Biden dropped out of the race early and they held a primary.  \n\nMost people reliably vote for one party or the other regardless of who the nominee is, most likely the answer to your second question. The GOP or the DNC could nominate a ham sandwich and a huge percentage of the electorate would vote for the sandwich that represents their party. \n\nI don't think that many people on the right care about race or gender nearly as much as everyone seems to think. If she was a white man they still wouldn't have voted dem.  They voted for Trump despite not liking him because his policies will tend to be the policies they are more in favor of, and Harris or whoever is the democratic candidates policies will tend not to be.",

You're basically blaming the Reagan revolution on Democrats, which IMO is perfectly backwards. There's a reason Democrats stopped passing great society legislation after LBJ: they lost. The racist backlash after the civil rights movement (combined with the party split over Vietnam) led to a systematic loss of support among core constituencies. Except for a brief moment after the Nixon-Ford debacle, Democrats have never had the power to pass legislation since. \n\nEven Obamacare, for the weakass reforms it created, was a legislative effort that barely made it over the finish line because *republicans blocked every possible angle of support*. Republicans refused to negotiate, Obama literally did a televised conference with them so that they could express what they wanted, but they asked for nothing. \n\nPeople forget that at the time it was considered outrageous that Republicans would refuse to negotiate on a piece of major legislation. But Congress broke in 2009 and it hasn't worked since. Because of Republicans.\n\n>identical\n\nJust one out of a million thoughts: if it weren't for Carter and Obama, solar power would be effectively impossible right now.

If you don't have a problem with those things, you're complicit. If you're complicit, you're part of the problem.\n\nIf your party is outwardly and publicly endorsed by the KKK, and no one says anything in opposition to that, that says a lot.

Most electoral wins come from a candidate getting more of their own party members to vote, or energizing people who don't normally vote to come vote for them.\n\nAs a result the strategy in the US isn't to convince the other party's people to vote for you, but to rile up your own party and the normally apathetic to support you.\n\nOne way to do this is to present policies that will energize them, and another is to rile them up against the other side so much that they will vote for you just to avoid the other side gaining power.\n\nIn that case, painting Trump voters and their party as the worst kind of scumbags is an effective strategy in order to get Democrats and apolitical people to vote against them. I think that the Democrats' main failures were not having good enough policies on their own **and** holding back from accurate attacks against Republicans and conservatives in general: Ideally, the messaging would make most normal people react to Republicans as if the latter had just admitted to eating babies on toast. Vilifying them as much as possible would be a more effective strategy to turn out vote against them than reaching out to them.",

Furthermore, these are the people all for the removal of people that fought and many who died for our country because they are the wrong skin color or are female. So they can fumble out whatever excuse they want, I'm no longer buying it.  Plus the courting of these votes requires moving further and further to the right, meaning its foolish attempt to win over people that will never vote Democrat, while losing the votes from people that might actually vote for a Democrat. Trying to win Trump voters over only decreases the chances of winning. As does being spineless and not calling out the hateful things they do for what it is.\n\nWhat is more important is the shove into the faces of the \"both sides\" crowd just how much worse the Republican party is. To shove in the faces of the Democrats that stayed home that even if its a less then perfect candidate, willfully handing the government over to modern day Republicans is far much worse.",

They're a direct result of the political division that *you* are perpetuating, and it's a common sight, historically. \n\nThe Roman Republic fell, because political division led to political stagnation as both sides began to prevent the other from succeeding. From political stagnation, you get radicalization, as people view stronger--and more homogenized--political beliefs as the only way to attain their political ends. From radicalization, you get demagoguery, as radicals become willing to do anything, if it accomplishes their political ends. From demagoguery, the Republic falls, as one side typically emerges victorious and changes the form of government.\n\n> But when a new generation arises and the democracy falls into the hands of the grandchildren of its founders, they have become so accustomed to freedom and equality that they no longer value them, and begin to aim at pre-eminence; and it is chiefly those of ample fortune who fall into this error. So when they begin to lust for power and cannot attain it through themselves or their own good qualities, they ruin their estates, tempting and corrupting the people in every possible way. And hence when by their foolish thirst for reputation they have created among the masses an appetite for gifts and the habit of receiving them, democracy in its turn is abolished and changes into a rule of force and violence. For the people, having grown accustomed to feed at the expense of others and to depend for their livelihood on the property of others, as soon as they find a leader who is enterprising but is excluded from the houses of office by his penury, institute the rule of violence; and now uniting their forces massacre, banish, and plunder, until they degenerate again into perfect savages and find once more a master and monarch.\n\n- Polybius, circa 2nd Century BC\n\nAs familiar as the first half of that sounds, that was written well over 2,000 years ago by a historian who saw the Roman Republic at it's height from the Greek point of view, saw it as a Roman citizen after it conquered Greece, and experienced the Roman Republic in its later years. He reasoned that the (then-rising) political tension would lead to a demagogue like Caesar, as quoted above. He died about 18 years before Caesar was born, and less than a hundred years later Caesar's great-nephew, Augustus, was crowned as the first Emporer of the Roman Empire. \n\nWe are getting disconcertingly-close to following in their footsteps, all signs point to that being the case, and you want to make matters worse, instead of reversing course?",

This whole, \"We would back down if you would\" finger-pointing game is diminutive and pointless.\n\nYou act like a centrist, but you're telling the 'left' to accommodate the 'right' based on some idea that the right is just 'fighting back' against the left; i.e. a victimization ploy. 'They started this' is the dumbest - and most convenient - fucking argument in the book for being unwilling to compromise.\n\nQuote everyone you want; to say, \"we're forced to be assholes because of you\" is a child's reaction.",

You're arguing with strawmen, no one would ever make the argument that the sole determing factor is exactly one specific demographic you're a part of, because people mandatorily belong to multiple subgroups at a time.\n\nIf you are a man you must also have an ethnicity, if you are a woman you must also have an income bracket. You're essentially arguing that any terminology that could be used to describe trends is actually useless because it's not like 90/10. It's a trend, you have to use language somehow, you can't just arbitrarily decide that something isn't a trend just because it's not completely overwhelming. Without that ability, you essentially are saying no generalizations can be made and we can't draw any conclusions for evidence except from exactly black voters in this election, but isn't that obviously untrue? To draw a conclusion you have to make a general rule, that's the whole method of inferential reasoning, which is a huge part of science.\n\nI'm going to assume you don't work in a field that requires statistics, because if you did, you would find very, very few instances of a 90/10 split for human behavior. Your statement would basically say everyone who studies human behavior shouldn't be taken seriously. Take, for instance, the Milgram experiment, only 65% of people went up to 450 volts. Yet as you said with minorities,\u00a0a full third\u00a0*of participants*\u00a0disagreed with that characterization so we can't make any statements about human behavior from that. But no, you have to accept that trends exist, there is an undeniably sequence of decisions that sum up to make Trump far more for white men than otherwise. You can't just decide science isn't real.\n\nLets do one last example, viewing it from the lens of a minority individual. Does Trump offer literally nothing to minorities? Of course not, his economic policies most likely to appeal to some of them. Does this change that, specifically with regards to them being a minority and nowhere else, his policies actively disadvantage them? Also no. His platform hurts minorities in many ways, while benefiting them in very few. However, those minorities belong to a plethora of subgroups that gain advantages for other things he does. If a minority is a man they get advantages from his policies that support men, if they are not part of the LGBTQ+ community, his policies benefit them, if they are working in a field without education requirements, they will likely benefit. Yet if you wanted to make the argument that he support minorities? No he just happens to support other groups that some of them fall into.",

How despite many of them voting for him because of the economy, he's crippled the US' influence on a global stage and making enemies out of allies, which is tanking the stock market, the economy and the US as a global power, as well as the power of the US dollar. And finally how if his conduct was at any point done by a democrat leader, how they'd all lose their minds over it.\n\nTldr: some name calling bad, most name calling good and deserving of it because his base treats him as a king who can do no wrong rather than the leader of a country held to account for his promises by the people...",

Hegseth has written in his book that Democrats are enemies of the state and are a threat to America. The people that wrote Project 2025 want to turn America into a Christian theocracy that only benefit white Christians are in Trump's cabinet and are enacting the policies within the project. As someone who is not white and atheist, you want me to be nice to people that support that, OP?

You're asking mice to just be nice to the cat that wants to eat them because being nice to the cat would somehow change its mind.\n\nEdit: Forgot to include something.

If the current president can act like he does, why do I need to somehow treat his supporters with more respect than the person they voted for? It's some ridiculous standard.

I live in a red state, lived in a red city for most of my life, and although my family and friends were not conservative, I knew a lot of conservative folks. \n\nI agree with your take on the idea that we should not generalize Trump voters under the umbrella of being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc (even if many of them are). There\u2019s a lot of conservatives I know personally that don\u2019t tick those boxes, and even support progressive economic policy that puts blue collar workers first. I gotta say, I respect conservatives for their selflessness in helping out their neighbors and fellow community members (which is missing in a lot of leftist spaces). \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019ll argue with you - you say that we need to understand WHY they\u2019re voting the way they vote to achieve any common ground. But here\u2019s the thing with 2024 Trump voters: There is a level of cognitive dissonance with this group that simply can\u2019t be reasoned with, at least, from a democratic standpoint. \n\nPlenty of these folks support Medicare, VA benefits and social security, but hate the concept of the \u2018welfare state\u2019. Talk to a conservative about communism without using any wOkE buzzwords and they\u2019ll fucking agree with you! If you say that workers should own the means of production, they\u2019ll say hell yeah brother! And later on they\u2019ll spout how communist liberals are ruining the country. \n\nA defining trait of conservatism is loyalty: loyalty to their nation, to their political party, to their family, to their \u2018people\u2019 (which tend to be white, cis and straight). Even if they support progressive ideas on paper, which in my experience, plenty of them do - there is simply no reasoning that will convince them to \u201cswitch sides\u201d, so to speak. \n\nI\u2019m currently volunteering my time with a few non-partisan working class groups in my area, and holy shit is it tough to convince conservatives to join our cause when they know leftists are involved.",

Cleary, media portrayed Trump voters as \"racist/homophobic/stupid/terrible human beings\", because much of it was low-hanging fruit and made for good comedy bits. But I don't think it was a marketing/media strategy the Democratic party took.\n\nI would say the issue the Democrats had were underestimating Trump and not understanding his appeal. Trump voters had legitimate issues and concerns, but Dems weren't listening. Also, Biden was a terrible messenger and Harris didn't have enough time to establish herself as a candidate with a real agenda. You just can't put together a coherent candidacy in 90-days, and she didn't have enough runaway to put together a compelling campaign.\n\nI would agree with you that many liberals think of Trump voters as terrible people and it prevents them from being able to have real conversations bridging the ideological divide. Democrats would be more persuasive in their arguments or appeal if they had more empathy and understanding where Trump voters were coming from. But this is also true from the other side of the aisle. Trump voters have their own fantastical narrative who liberals are, which motivated them to to the polls and vote for Trump.\n\nThat's where I think the flaw in your argument is. A polarized electorate is more likely to vote against someone they hate/despise. Trump has done an excellent job turning his voters against liberals, whether it is their candidate, their voters, or identity groups. An argument could be made the liberals didn't do enough to denigrate Trump, Republicans or their voters. They brought a butter knife to a grenade fight.",

There might have been a few centrist senators and blue dog Democrats that embraced it. However, the point of trickle down was to justify tax cuts for the rich with the premise that when the rich get richer, more economic activity occurs which could be taxed downstream. With, of course, the side-effect that entitlement programs and discretionary spending would have to be cut. Driven by Reagan and a pendulum swing response to liberal policies pushed in the previous decades. By all accounts, you could even consider Nixon a liberal president based upon some of his policies.\n\nAgain, none of this was standard economic theory the Democrats embraced. One area of contention might be free trade policies. You saw an exodus of manufacturing during the 80's, and the acceleration of that during the 90's with NAFTA - a bill Clinton signed into law.\n\nI bring that up because Trump came of age during the 80's. The persona he tries to craft of himself is someone that is rich and successful based on the old way of doing things. The more money the rich can make, the better. They deserve it. They've earned in. Everyone should be able to have an opportunity to be rich like he is. They just need to be 'winners' like him. And everyone who gets in their way, collectively, is a loser that needs to be punished.\n\nSo, if you're living in a world that has been treating you unfairly, follow Trump and he'll make you a winner. He'll kick out all the immigrants invading your neighborhood raising demand for housing. He'll finally make America rich because everyone else has been \"ripping us off\". As long as you pledge your loyalty to him, your fortunes will turn around. And if there are rules and regulations preventing you from getting ahead? Just ignore them.\n\nHuge emotional appeal. All your problems go away if you just believe what he has to say. Even though his actual economic policies aren't really going to help his base. He just promises they will help the little guy, even if there's nothing in it for them.\n\nTrump is a liar and a fraud. Again, when you analyze what his policies say vs. his rhetoric, they don't line up. Trump, however, is an expert at blaming his failures on others. Which actually appeals to most of his base. They feel like they are in the same boat. It's not my fault I find myself in such a predicament. It's someone elses and they should pay. It's an emotional sell Trump is pushing. He's 100% tapped in to grievances others have.\n\nThis time around is going to be different. He has complete control of all branches of government and doesn't have anyone holding him back. His failures are going to be on full display.",

I know I\u2019m going to lose a lot of people with that but my own personal experience as a white guy raised in the heartland to specifically not be racist, what I and many of the people were taught was really something that was effectively race essentialism. That is, the idea that different racial groups have natural strengths and weaknesses. Think \u2018black people are great at sports\u2019 and \u2018Asians are great at math\u2019.\n\nI think this also explains why discussions about racism within the modern Republican Party are so difficult. Many conservatives genuinely believe that all races can succeed, just in different ways. They don\u2019t see this as racist because, in their view, acknowledging racial differences in strengths isn\u2019t the same as believing in racial inferiority. However, this perspective still reinforces racial hierarchies by assuming that white people are naturally more suited for leadership, intellectualism, and governance, while other racial groups are better at physical labor, entertainment, or athletics.\n\nSo many friends and family I knew back home had rejected overt racism but many had a visceral reaction to Obama becoming president. The backlash wasn\u2019t just about policy; it was about disrupting a deeply ingrained belief system\u2014one where Black Americans weren\u2019t supposed to excel in traditionally \u201cwhite\u201d spaces of power and leadership. If racial essentialism holds that different groups have natural lanes of success, then a Black man leading the most powerful nation in the world felt like a fundamental disruption of the \u201cnatural order.\u201d\n\nMaybe the message has to be tailored better but I don\u2019t think we can continue ignoring the issue of whether or not supporting a racist, misogynist, homophobic regime is racist or not. It is. And the conversation isn\u2019t going to move forward if we keep shying way from the truth just because we want to tell someone the problem is everyone else in the GOP and not their own biases.",

He won a few, but by and large his base didn't grow. 94% of republicans voted for him in 2020, and 94% of them voted for him in 2024 as well. It was the democrats who failed to turn out voters in their base to the tune of 10-15 million people. Was this because they weren't catering to maga enough? No. It's because they provided no alternative to the status quo. They allowed the trump campaign to go on the offensive and dictate the media conversation, constantly defending themselves at every turn and failing to attack trumpism meaningfully. They made the same mistake Clinton made in 2016.\n\nTrump won more votes than any other candidate in the race, but he did not win the popular vote. A majority of voters voted for the other three candidates, or not at all. Because their vote was split or non existent, trump won. If the democrats weren't so incompetent and attacked trumpism from the *left;* if they stopped coddling conservative ghouls and started fighting the tide of fascism, perhaps they could unite voters against the maga cohort. But they failed to do those things, and so they lost.\n\nThe democrats do not need them. They need everyone else. Going after the republican stronghold of voters is a losing strategy and we now have two elections to prove it. Why try it a third time? They're not gonna change their minds anyway.\n\nThere should be no sympathy for trump voters or trumpism. These people had been told by everyone around them what a second trump term would bring, whom it would hurt, how bad for the economy, all of it. And still, they willingly chose to be ignorant and hateful and selfish with their vote. They've spent years deflecting criticism by calling their detractors \"snowflakes who got their feelings hurt.\" But God forbid people be upset they helped usher in a fascist dictatorship. We should call that behavior what it is: Nazi appeasement.",

Or something relating to his foreign policy.  Or how it isn't a fiscal conservative move to propose raising the debt ceiling by $4.5 trillion.  Using their own talking points and buzzwords against them is more effective if they're still emotionally in a spot where they're not exhibiting cultlike behavior.\n\nBut if they're literally so deeply entrenched in MAGA bs that you can tell right off the bat, there is nothing you can possibly do to save them except to make them feel like shit at every possible turn.

But with Trump voters I feel it\u2019s best to figure out which of two groups they fall in: evil vs fool. \n\n\nThe fool is someone who has fell time and time again for lies. They feel attacked when they\u2019re told their point of view is lacking information or unkind. It\u2019s hard for them to admit they\u2019re wrong because they tie being right into their morals and beliefs. While it\u2019s not impossible to find middle ground with them, it is tiresome. They will always find a way to not be entirely wrong and their cognitive dissonance is so strong. Unless I actually know them, it isn\u2019t worth it to coddle their ego and have an actual conversation. \n\nThe evil person is exactly what the name calling implies. Sure, they could pull an old Grand Wizard who turned not racist in their old age, but at that point they\u2019ve caused so much damage and ticked others into those awful beliefs that it doesn\u2019t matter. All they deserve is shame because I am not going to go out of my way to be nice to someone who will actively call me slurs and threaten my life. If they initiate a willingness to change, I will help as much as I\u2019m able to (without letting it have a negative impact on my mental health).",

It just isn't true. GOP in general have a lower likelihood of switching votes. \n\nWhere Dems win/lose is mobilizing their base and convincing intermittent voters to actually show up.

The Dems that were high on negative partisanship won and the ones that didn't lost. \n\n>This was the line the media and party Democrats took, repeatedly painting wide swathes of the electorate as deplorable and hateful\n\nI wish it were true but it's just conservative, culture war bullshit.

When you look at people who the Democrats insult, they are by and large are people who are not going to vote for anyone but Trump. They\u2019re not interested in cross the aisle discourse and don\u2019t even want to hear from the other side. Now, you can say that they became angry, and that there are downsides to making them angry, particularly whilst they\u2019re in power, but they still have one vote. You can\u2019t reach out to this group, so why try? \n\nAfter that, there are swing voters who vote essentially based on economy alone. They are big believers of both sides bad and won\u2019t be swung closer or away based on rhetoric. They actually expect that both sides are already calling them good for nothings most of the time and switch up and grovel for their votes in an election season. They\u2019re assuming the worst of both sides as is. \n\nMy point is that rhetoric plays an exceptionally small role in general elections. To prove my point, I\u2019ll ask you this. 2024 was an election marred by super inflation and anti incumbent sentiment worldwide. If DJT was president, who do you think would have won 2024? \n\nI will say this. For the side not in power, screeching about the other side is both a common and an effective election strategy. It can build on already existing anti incumbent sentiment. The thing the Dems did was puzzling was using this strategy \\*as incumbents\\*. I won\u2019t lie; it was pretty shocking to see in real time. I don\u2019t think the Presidency was winnable even with a perfect campaign, but maybe we keep Pennsylvania and Ohio\u2019s Senate seats with more focused campaigns.\n\nI think we are so shocked from watching Dems try this when they were the incumbents that a lot of people don\u2019t want to see them use it even as non-incumbents, but I think it is misguided because screeching about the incumbent is a well proven strategy.",

Part of the answer may be that in a two party system voters end up having a choice which may boil down to picking one candidate who is bad or another who is worse.

That\u2019s a different question. \n\nMany Trump voters see his first presidency as not expressing the MAGA agenda and compromised by obstructionism from the establishment of both parties and the media and his own lack of experience and poor personnel choices. They\u2019ve given him another chance. \n\nNo need to empathise with Trump as opposed to the people who voted for him. Though I\u2019d point out the corporate media have given empathetic coverage to Biden frequently promoting him as suffering through personal tragedies and being a great public servant and pressing the quality of empathy. The reality of Biden as someone with a history of repeated even pathological lying about all things personal and political is well documented even in progressive media sites and as bad or worse than what Trump was accused of and many of the claims as to what Trump said or did e.g Charlottesville were themselves lies. Biden\u2019s policy history over the decades is also open to severe criticism from progressives. \n\nTo the extent the demonisation of Trump doesn\u2019t  line up with the way many see him it wouldn\u2019t cut through with voters or might be counter productive.

It\u2019s a betrayal and they deserve to know why we feel this way. \n\nI hear what you\u2019re saying about understanding WHY people voted that way and being able to harness some of that knowledge for influential purpose. I think it\u2019s incredibly important for us all to understand that many people voted for him because they are racist, stupid, and dishonest. Is it everyone that voted for him? No but an actions matter. If you voted for it, then you voted for racism, stupidity, dishonest, and terror. And for those who are adamant that they absolutely did not like those aspects of his platform we have to wonder why it was worth the risk of voting for him at all then? Christianity? If so, we shouldn\u2019t be concerned. Trump is not a Christian, does not uphold the values, and there should be a separation of church and state anyway. \n\nWe\u2019ve tried appealing to them in so many ways and it\u2019s done nothing but get us laughed at and harassed. Instead of saying \u201cplay nice\u201d we need to call them out directly and commit to educating folks. Trump loves undereducated people because they\u2019re easy to dupe. The correlation between red states and awful education is a self fulfilling prophecy. We can only expect people to do better if they know better. That\u2019s where we should focus our energy.",

They continued to cut taxes for high earners and corporations  on the lie that it will generate more tax revenue than it cuts but we now have decades of data both at federal and state levels that shows this does not occur. They are using the debt as a reason to cut social safety nets and earned entitlements, but the math doesn\u2019t add up. This is an ideological shift of where resources are distributed and not movement to pay off debt or balance the budget.\n\nIf you care about rule of law, Trumps administration has pardoned and released convicted criminals who attacked the capital on J6, continues to break constitutional and federal law in executing policy as well as violations of personal rights. Doesn\u2019t not care or understand the framework of the government. Has hired people in ICE, FBI, etc who openly admit to not caring about law of rights for individuals they deem undeserving. being able to selectively apply law and rights mean none of our rights are safe. If action continue to follow their rhetoric it could put more Americans and others in jeopardy.\n\nIf you care about the economy, while off shoring and corporate actions have continued to erode the manufacturing work of Americans, it is a double edge sword that leads to cheaper consumer prices. Trumps global policy and America first foreign policy is ineffectual in driving the change of reshoring, its is maximally destructive in current supply chains, relations, and the PR alone is driving outright boycott sentiment of foreign markets. This is likely to lead to a recession, and may detract the marketability of American products world wide for a long time. will this lead to higher rates of unemployment, lower pay? Absolutely, will America be able to rebuild the economy to be a power of manufacturing? Uncertain, it will be nearly a total reset with many other countries already caught up and ready to compete. Why are we restarting a race we are already out in front of?  measured and nuanced change is what is needed to support American manufacturing.\n\nIf you care about Americas role in the world, for centuries America has been a check to authoritarian/communist regimes and sought to reward and protect democracies and cooperating nations. We have protected American and allied interests around the globe which has trickle down effects to all Americans that are rarely noticed. We are now pulling away from our role and the world we have created. an isolationist America will have less control of keeping the world safe and aligned with our interests. The effects of this are hard to measure, but there will definitely be negatives and overall destabilization is likely. \n\nIf you care about honesty, transparency, freedom of speech, and accountability. Trumps rhetoric and actions are to remove or punish any criticism both factual and opinion. He is attacking news sources, reporters, and opposition politics. He has called democrats and others traitors. Villainizing opposition and removing it will lead to unchecked accountability and little to no transparency. The Trump admin is removing, defunding, and replacing many government institutions who find, compile, calculate data for business and personal use across a range of weather, climate, census, medical, health, research etc. this will lead to less data driven understanding of challenges for America and will allow for messaging to further disconnect from measured reality. DOGE has repeatedly falsely and erroneously reported finding by their own admission several times. Trump has a laundry list from this and his previous term of lying. Trump admin and his appointments has routinely denied appearing in front of Congress to answer questions and be held accountable. \n\nIf you care about ethics in business and life, Trumps admin and Trump have routinely sold appointments for support, protected officials under legal trouble for bribes and other unethical behavior, employeed legal teams who act unethically and frivolously. It seems to me that overall they want a world more liken to Italy and Russia where money greases hands and using public office to enrich themselves is completely appropriate. They cite this will allow America to compete with world, but it is a road down to a crony market and open to foreign influence. This is directly opposed to America\u2019s prior roll to trying to influence and eliminate these mindset in the world. Even though corruption and these unethical practices exist even in America, this is a full embrace of it and will only lead to unethical people winning more in America and ethical people being displaced.\n\nIf you care about Trump delivering effect change, many of his previous administration has come out said he is incapable of delivering. He doesn\u2019t understand the process, doesn\u2019t understand how to fix the problems he touts and his impulses are usually destructive and counter productive to conservative values.",

A smaller and smaller section of the electorate are actually in play come election time, and instead the results are decided by who gets their base mad enough to turn out in greater proportions. So again, arguably you don't need to win over any Trump voters, you just need to appeal to the Harris voters who stayed home over Gaza, or her refusal to distance herself from Biden.",

I'm sure they don't like being told that, but it's simply a fact -- their actions don't match their words, which means they're lying (probably to themselves as much as anyone else, because lying to yourself/maintaining a weird sort of \"internal plausible deniability\" is a big part of what conservatism is).\n\nConsider how many Republicans before and during the election insisted that they were voting because of the \"economy\", and that they didn't believe he was actually going to enact Project 2025...and then consider how few Republicans are coming out against Trump's econonic devastation and Project 2025 actions now. They complain when *they* get screwed by his economic policies, but they still back him and support what he's doing otherwise (there are obviously exceptions, but Trump still has the support of most Republicans).\n\nThere is no other explanation for that besides accepting that a large number of Republicans claimed one thing but actually believe another set of things in practice.\n\n>This was the line the media and party Democrats took, repeatedly painting wide swathes of the electorate as deplorable and hateful- and we can see clearly it didn\u2019t secure them victory\n\nIt did in 2020, right?\n\nSo it seems that the causal factor isn't calling Trump voters names -- it is other factors.\n\nAlso, Trump won while actively threatening his opposition, so it's clearly possible to do so. The idea that you have to be nice to your opponents to win is completely undercut by the fact that Trump won!\n\n>My view is that as long as this attitude continues of assuming all Trump voters are a monolith of evil liars and refusing to consider that their stated concerns are legitimate (even if they are wrong) the Democratic party will continue to lose support and government seats\n\nThis simply doesn't seem to be the case. When Democrats take a hard line against conservatives and more importantly in favor of progressive policies (or are even perceived as such, whether or not that's their actual intention), they win. That is what happened with Obama -- despite being a disgusting centrist in practice, Obama was very much *perceived* as a progressive, and he won handily both times he ran.\n\nBut when they try to compromise with conservatives, they routinely get defeated, because a person who thinks immigrants are causing the death of the white race and need to be purged even if it means abandoning the Constitution (which is the mainstream Republican view at this point) isn't going to vote for a Democrat no matter what they say. And meanwhile if a Democrat tries to appease Republicans by attacking non-white people, they end up losing support from their own base.\n\nIt is a simple fact that the US is highly polarized at this point, and there really aren't that many people in the middle. Republicans win because they maximize the turnout of their own base by brutally attacking and demonizing their opposition. Democrats lose because they attack their own base in an effort to appeal to an imagined \"middle\" that simply isn't there (or if it is they it is very small and thus they lose more votes than they gain by going after it).\n\nI think the far better strategy for Democrats is to give up on Republicans entirely and instead focus on turning out a portion of the 89 million or so people who could have voted but didn't in the last election (Trump got about 77 million, Harris got about 75 million, and about 89 million eligible voters didn't vote). I genuinely think that there are far more non-voters who would be attracted by Dems taking a hard line against fascist Republicans than there are fascist Republicans who will vote for a Dem.\n\nSadly, at least so far Dems simply don't want to expand the electorate -- they would rather just duke it out with Republicans for a smaller portion of the population.",

Which is very critical and aggressive, but most people that could/would have grace for trump voters are real fed up, and have no patience anymore. \n\nThat being said, i\u2019m also incredibly critical of democrats; they\u2019re fucking useless. Their entire campaign strategy seems to be \u201clook how much better it would be of we were elected\u201d or \u201cwe hold majority, but republicans are being difficult and we can\u2019t pass anything.\u201d With few exceptions, they\u2019re all bought by some corporation, so it doesn\u2019t really matter what their constituents want. \n\nIf we ever hope to get any kind of majority vote or agreement, we need to get money out of politics period, institute stuff like term limits, and get people to wake up and realize they aren\u2019t limited to shit choice and shittier choice. \n\nThat starts on a personal level. Instead of constantly just bitching about politics seriously ask yourself; when was the last time you voted for any candidate that you actually supported based on politics alone and not just cause they were the recommendation of the dnc/rnc? When was the last time you got even peripherally in a single political issue/ballot initiative/grassroots movement? \n\nNot saying people need to devote all their time to politics, but instead of rage posting about stuff for the nth time, do something to actually get involved in your community. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll actually get any kind of lasting change",

And the hard Democrats and hard Republicans will never shift allegiances even temporarily.  You could be a pro-life activist and you'll vote for a Republican who wants to legalize abortion without restrictions.\n\nI would describe the more racist elements of the Republican Party to be non-malleable.  They're not going to change their support... at least not for a while.  And the Democrats going back to their roots and running around in Klansmen outfits isn't going to flip these people.  Not without turning off too many Hard-D people.\n\nThe reason why Biden was successful was because he wasn't targeting swing voters but instead soft Republicans.  His appeal was, look this guy is absolutely crazy and the people supporting him... look at them they're crazy.  That's not you.  You care about America vote for me just so we can get rid of this guy.\n\nAnd that more or less worked.  I think where Harris failed is that her message was just, please show up because traditionally Democrats win when voter count is high.... which is just magical thinking.\n\nI think the Democrats do have to shift closer to the centre to win an election (as they always have).  I don't think they have to tone down messages against Trump's core supporters to win the election.  I think they can peel off and win the neo-conservative and neo-liberal vote.  I think broadly more people are accepting neo-conservatism and neo-liberalism in response to Trump and there's a real demand for leadership that will embrace free trade.",

People keep repeating this idea that Democrats lose because they label Trump voters negatively without understanding their motivations. But think about it this way:\n\nTrump voters have consistently supported him despite countless controversies\u2014sexual assault allegations, impeachment hearings, election denial, and now even aligning himself with Putin in international negotiations. If voters continue backing him after all of that, then clearly they aren\u2019t responding to rational political debate or subtle policy discussions. At this point, bluntly calling them out might be exactly what resonates with moderates who are exhausted from pretending Trump supporters are acting in good faith.\n\nAnd honestly, how many times do we need to \u201cunderstand\u201d motivations rooted in conspiracy theories or misinformation? Studies have repeatedly shown Trump supporters are disproportionately susceptible to misinformation (source). Trying to delicately empathize or reason with individuals who\u2019ve embraced such a worldview has consistently failed. Democrats have been overly cautious\u2014playing nice for fear of alienating voters who were never realistically going to shift their support anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s harsh, but perhaps outright shaming is more effective than polite discourse because it at least clearly defines a moral line voters have to reckon with. The alternative\u2014tiptoeing around clear moral failings or misinformation\u2014has only normalized extremist positions, leading the Democratic Party to cede ground repeatedly.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real, understanding why someone voted a certain way matters less when that vote consistently endorses problematic behavior. At a certain point, it stops being about misunderstanding their rationale and starts being about challenging their comfort in supporting clearly damaging actions and rhetoric.",

They were told Trump winning was impossible. They were told Trump's first term was a fluke. They gassed each other up. The media told them Kamala was ahead 15 points the day before the election. Then they lost.\n\nMany of these people have big parts of their social identity wrapped up in politics. It's who they are. It's the primary lens from which they view the world. The day before the election he was the stupidest person alive. How do you lose an election to the stupidest person alive when you're the smartest person in every room?\n\nThe vitriol and histrionics is a rehash of what happened in 2016-2020. They can't rage against the party that represents a major part of their identity, so they pour all their grievances into Trump- which the party is more than happy to enable because it takes the scrutiny off them. Everyone is too busy with their nose glued to a screen waiting for Trump's next big fuckup to stop and ask themselves \"if Democrats have had majorities and supermajorities in house, senate, and white house several times in the last 20 years why haven't they done a single fucking thing they said they would?\".\n\nIt's a big dog and pony show. The greatest show on earth. They're all actors playing a role and were just watching the new weekly episodes. It's a big club. And we ain't in it.\n\nPersonally, I miss the storyline from the 60s where the inflation adjusted median wage was $120k. This one where literally 99 cents out of every dollar in growth goes to billionaires has me wanting to invest in dog catching poles and chainsaws.",
