    "selftext": "I would say this closer to \"Extraordinary Rendition\" except in this case the people were in the United States, vs I believe previously it was taking people from other countries and never bringing them to US jurisdiction. Deporting them to their home countries would be one thing, this is not just deporting.  He basically sent them to the equivalent of a for profit Guantanamo Bay in El Salvador where they will be indefinitely detaineed for \"terrorism\" and used for cheap labor.  They already tried to send them to Guantanamo once, so this keeps in line with it.  Marco Rubio said, speaking about the prisoners in El Salvador, \"If one of them turns out not to be[a gang member], then they're just illegally in our country, and the Salvadorans can then deport them to Venezuela.\".  It seems based on some of the articles, that the only thing linking them to a gang is a rose tattoo.  ",

Don't mistake my defense of the system or defense of Biden/Obama in this situation as some blind loyalty. I will call out Democrats just as often as Republicans, the Green Party, the Libretarians, the Whigs, whatever.\n\n________________________________\n\nTrump is a conman, he has been for literal decades. The people he surrounds himself with are conmen, liars, and a some of them are legitimate and admitted white supremecists. (You could be a white supremencists/nationalist, and I can't really help you there, but will assume you are not that far gone. My comments apply either way.)\n\nTrump and his people would sell you and 99% of this country out for a dollar. They are currently grifting for far more than a dollar. They are selling out this country, and you (and me), in front of all of us. They would happily put you on that same plane they used for these alleged cartel members if they thought they would benefit from it in some way.\n\nI would have this same argument with any other person if it was you on those planes, despite our differences in opinion and political leanings. The process is the process, and rights are rights.\n\nWhile you believe that this is just some hammer of justice coming down with the iron fist of the law, this is them eroding the system to make it that much easier to do the same to you and anyone you love if that is what they choose to do down the line. There is a way to be harsh on crime and still be above board when it comes to legality and human rights.\n\nWhile you might see me/us/the left (or whatever label you ascribe to us) as the enemy, we are not. Despite what you think of our politicians, do not confuse us with them. There is a reason the Dems lost, and it was not completely because of Trump and MAGA.

Perhaps I am wrong and there is some specific context to this, but if \"deport\" is inaccurate then I'd imagine the term \"extraordinary rendition\" suffers from a similar lack of specificity and context. I'm trying to understand what is the view you want changed.\n\nIf you problem is that you feel the language is too soft, then \"extraordinary rendition\" is even worse because it's even softer, if you would like to use a harsher term I believe \"human traffiking\"would be more direct and accurate. [Trump triggered the economic crisis in Venezuela](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/6/trump-imposes-economic-embargo-against-venezuela) during his first term, and then brought in refugees from Venezuela, [he even extended their stay](https://www.axios.com/2019/06/12/trump-increased-protections-venezuelans-fleeing), and now he is sending them to a third country as for profit slave labor without due process.\n\nHowever it remains unclear to me if this is your view and concern, hence why I am asking these questions.",

Glad I could be of help.\n\nHowever, I'd still caution against \"extraordinary rendition\" because that term came into use precisely to try and hide the human rights abuses being done in places like Guantanamo Bay during the War on Terror. To you it might be clear what you mean by it, but it won't mean anything to people who did not live through those news cycles, or who might be from different countries. Using that term ensures that most of the people who read what you write or hear what you say will miss the point you're trying to draw attention to.\n\nAs to their rights, given they were never convicted anywhere I'm not sure they have any left. There is no conviction to be appealed, and there is no government to appeal to. As I understand it Bukele could not release the prisoners to Venezuela itself either, if he did they could simply try to go back tot he US.\n\nMainly I believe we are waiting to understand if some of the comments Bukele made means they will be used as forced labor or if the intent is for CECOT to function as an effective death camp through death by natural causes alone due to the absurdly poor living conditions. After all with 100 people in a single cell with only 2 toilets disease seems inevitable, but while hundreds have already died it is difficult to estimate how this might look at full scale given how empty most of the facility remains given it's planned capacity.",

Their cases are now civil, basically instead of the government having to prove that they were guilty, their lawyers now have to prove that the government made a mistake. And, honestly, even if they prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that all of these men were innocent, it's unlikely the current administration will actually bring them back.

This isn't Law and Order, the where Jack McCoy can just monologue his way around Constitutional protections. If the state fails to uphold its obligations (fair and speedy trial, assorted enumerated and judicially interpreted rights, discovery, etc), then \"results\" can be nullified. This does not always happen, and in fact our nation's history is littered with examples of courts failing to protect people from governmental overreach. But it's all there in the foundational documents, and the state should be held accountable when it falls short - even if they know for sure that you did it. The presumption of innocence requires it.\n\nYou can also argue with results on the grounds of - and I hate to do this because it's such a basic-bitch thing to say, but it applies - correlation versus causation. I'm not familiar with El Salvador, or what legal changes they may have implemented lately, but in general it's not sufficient to establish that two things happened concurrently. Is there evidence of a causal link between their particular incarceration strategy and increased safety? And if so, are we sure that's the only way to achieve the intended result? Is it possible that there's another way to achieve the same or better results that causes less \"collateral damage\"?\n\nIn short, yes you absolutely can argue with results.",

If you believe that it isn't fully deportation because the US paying for their incarceration implies some control... I somewhat agree. But the law trump is using also allows him to \"apprehend, restrain, secure, or remove\" people without trial. So whether or not it is a \"deportation\" is immaterial to whether he is allowed to do what he is doing.\n\nOfficially, this is restrainment and removal under [50 U.S. Code \u00a7 21](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/21).\n\n[Trump claims](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/) that Tren de Aragua (TdA) \"operates in conjunction with C\u00e1rtel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela\".\n\nNicolas Maduro is the President of Venezuela. So by making this claim he is saying that TdA activies are an incursion by the country of Venezuela.\n\nThe law here doesn't care about what someone has done. The elements of the law that allow Trump to arrest, imprison, or remove/deport them are:\n\n1. The president must declare a \"predatory incursion\" by a \"foreign nation or government\": [Executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/)\n2. The person must be one of that nation's \"natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects\".\n3. The person must be 14 or older.\n4. The person must not be a US citizen.\n\n> It seems based on some of the articles, that the only thing linking them to a gang is a rose tattoo.\n\nAll Venezuela nationals are now subject to [50 U.S. Code \u00a7 21](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/21) if they are below the age of 14 and not US citizens. While Trump has ordered that only those belonging to TdA are to be sent to El Salvador, the law does not require him to be so specific. He does not need to meet even probable cause standard that they are TdA since he is not required to prove they belong to TdA at all.\n\nI am not trying to change your view that this is wrong to do. I am not even trying to change your view on if it is a correct use of the Alien Enemies act. I am only trying to say that this is a deportation in the dictionary sense and in the legal sense it is some combination of restraining, securing, and removing.",
