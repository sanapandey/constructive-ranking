    "selftext": "The phrases \"The Religion of Peace\" and \"Revert\" aren't just empty slogans. They're condescending, entitled attempts to rewrite history and present Islam as something it simply isn't. These terms not only ignore the brutal and violent expansion of Islam but also reflect an attitude of superiority, one that dismisses the agency of non-Muslims while asserting an entitlement to define what others should believe.\n\nFirst, \"The Religion of Peace\" is one of the most audacious and misleading slogans in religious discourse. To frame Islam as a religion solely of peace is to completely ignore its violent history. Islam didn\u2019t just spread through peaceful preaching, it expanded through military conquest. From the Rashidun Caliphate's bloody wars across the Levant and Persia to the invasions of the Indian subcontinent, Islam's spread was built on violence and force. To claim Islam is \"The Religion of Peace\" is not just historically inaccurate, it\u2019s intellectually dishonest and deeply insulting to the millions of people who were either killed or coerced into conversion. The violent history of Islam in these regions cannot and should not be swept under the rug with such an entitled, condescending label. It\u2019s an attempt to erase the real experiences of those who lived under conquest and occupation, transforming the narrative into a sanitized, politically convenient myth. This slogan is an attempt to deny the inconvenient truth of Islam's violent expansion, pushing an image of peacefulness that simply doesn\u2019t match the historical reality.\n\nBut it goes beyond historical revisionism, it's simple about entitlement. The use of the term \"Religion of Peace\" implies that Islam is not just another religion, but the ultimate, superior way of life. It asserts that everyone should accept this narrative without question, that Muslims have a right to dictate the interpretation of their faith to the entire world. The term ignores the legitimate concerns of non-Muslims and disregards the suffering caused by Islam\u2019s spread. It is a deeply rude and dismissive label that reduces a complex and often painful history to a feel-good slogan.\n\nThe term \"Revert\" is equally patronizing and reeks of entitlement. It suggests that a non-Muslim, upon converting to Islam, isn't merely making a personal, informed choice, but they're \"returning\" to their true nature, as though their past beliefs were some sort of error or deviation from the supposed natural state of humanity. It denies the autonomy and validity of anyone's previous faith or worldview. To call someone a \"revert\" is not just condescending, it\u2019s incredibly rude and disrespectful to non-Muslims and reveals their superiority complex. It implies that those outside Islam are inherently lost or misguided, and that Islam is the only legitimate, \"correct\" path for all people. This attitude is a form of intellectual and spiritual colonialism, assuming that non-Muslims are somehow incomplete until they accept Islam.\n\nThese slogans reflect an overarching sense of entitlement that Islam, not just as a religion but as a belief system, has a monopoly on truth. It\u2019s as if the entire world must ultimately \"revert\" or accept Islam\u2019s narrative, and that anyone who resists is simply ignorant or lost. The constant use of these terms is not just an attempt to frame Islam in a positive light\u2014it\u2019s an attempt to shut down meaningful conversation, to impose a specific, one-sided version of reality that disregards history, cultural differences, and individual choice.\n\nWhat\u2019s most troubling about these terms is that they are tools used to silence criticism. They aren't just statements of belief, they\u2019re assertions of power and dominance, designed to push a singular narrative that cannot be questioned. The use of \"Religion of Peace\" and \"Revert\" isn't just an attempt to define Islam as something it\u2019s not; it\u2019s an assertion that others must accept that definition without debate. It\u2019s a form of intellectual entitlement, one that doesn\u2019t care for the reality of others' experiences and beliefs. It's time to call out these slogans for what they truly are: intellectually dishonest, rude, and condescending attempts to rewrite history and impose a single, narrow narrative.\n\nGranted, all religions inherently believe in their own truth, but most are able to engage with other belief systems without feeling the need to assert their superiority at every turn. For instance, while Christianity proclaims Jesus as the way to salvation, it generally respects the beliefs of others, especially in the modern context, by emphasizing personal choice and the importance of love and tolerance. Similarly, Hinduism, with its diverse array of gods and philosophies, doesn't typically engage in efforts to diminish or invalidate other religious traditions, instead focusing on coexistence. Even in Judaism, while the belief in one God and the covenant with the Jewish people is central, there is a respect for other monotheistic religions and their practices. In contrast, Islam's use of terms like \"The Religion of Peace\" and \"Revert\" goes beyond just believing in its truth, it actively demands that others acknowledge Islam as the only valid path, dismissing the complexity of other worldviews and, at times, subtly undermining non-Muslim identities. This isn't just the belief in one\u2019s own truth\u2014it\u2019s an imposed superiority, actively positioning Islam above all others and demanding acceptance of that superiority in a way that other religions do not.",

It's related to Salam (or Shalom in Hebrew), peace or wholeness, etc.  Islam is literally something like \"submission.\"  The idea being that submission to God is a gateway to peace.  That's peace in the theological sense, the kind Christians, Jews, and Muslims greet each other with.  It's about the individual, rather than the community or the history, etc.\n\nInstitutions of all sorts, religious or otherwise, attempt to eject or minimize problematic aspects of their past, while lifting up what has survived the test of time.  I don't think that's necessarily disingenuous.  I also don't think it's unique to religion.\n\nFWIW, I can't argue against you when it comes to \"revert.\"  It implies everyone else has wandered from the correct path, making it explicit that the person's worldview is not pluralist.  Pluralism, in my opinion, should be the goal... especially when religions/denominations/traditions share so much more in common than they differ on, and yet go to war etc over those differences.",

Throughout history, Christian churches of various stripes have persecuted those who do not convert. Some examples:\n\n1. The Gospel according to Matthew blames the Jewish leadership for bribing the Romans to spread rumors about the disciples stealing Jesus' body, so that they could deny Jesus' purported resurrection. There is, of course, not a shred of evidence for this, and the motivations are backwards: it's unclear why the Jewish leaders would need to bribe the Roman soldiers to lie to the governor in order to convince other Jews of what had happened, given the general mistrust the Jewish population had of the Roman leaders, and the *greater* animosity toward the Romans among the Jewish masses than among the Jewish elites (the Jewish revolts against the Romans were almost always lead by non-elites). However, the author of Matthew needs to find a way to blame the Jews for not accepting Jesus.\n2. The Catholic Church and its adherents persecuted Jews and other groups it seemed heretics for most of its history. Examples include the pogroms enacted by the crusaders of the First Crusade in the Jewish communities on the Rhine and the Danube; the Albigensian crusade; and the attacks during the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320. It wasn't limited to physical violence, either: examine, for instance, the Disputation for Paris, a shame trial of the Jewish religious texts orchestrated by Catholics which resulted in the burning of hundreds of old manuscripts of the Talmud in 1242. Upon hearing of this result, King Louis IX, who would later be canonized as a saint, was reported to have said that only skilled clerics should conduct a disputation with Jews, but that laymen \"should plunge a sword into those who speak ill of Christ.\"\n3. If you think this is just about the Catholic Church, think again. Martin Luther, the originator of the Protestant Reformation, wrote an entire treatise called \"On the Jews and their Lies,\" in which he advocated that Jewish homes be burned, their synagogues and schools set on fire, their property confiscated, and that \"these poisonous envenomed worms,\" as he called them, should be drafted into forced labor or be forcibly expelled from Christian lands. He also says that Christians are \"at fault for not slaying them.\"\n4. This problem has not disappeared in more modern times: while there was a reprieve in the reckoning the followed the Holocaust (e.g. Vatican II), to this day, Christians of many denominations still use terms for Jews as slurs: note the use of \"Pharisee\"\u2014the ancestors of rabbinic Judaism\u2014for someone who likes following rules (a stereotype of religious Jews). For more on this, see the [following article,](https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/ox-has-gored) which traces antisemitism in *liberal* Christian circles. Conservative circles have their own brand: see e.g. [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/08/22/how-anti-semitic-beliefs-have-quietly-taken-hold-among-some-evangelical-christians/).",

It's a literal anti-queer, white supremacist fascist administration which is consolidating into a dictatorship as we speak. They're no child, they're a gleeful bigot. They pretend to disapprove of Islam for its oppression of LGBTQ people, but it comes off as jealousy.",

Christiantiy has engaged in countless reforms and is generally very adaptable  to changing contexts (granted exceptions exist). They're also had their credibility absolutely obliterated in the modern era because everyone realizes how shitty they are. These factors (reformation, adaptability, and guilt) make Christians, or at least the ones I've engaged with generally passive and defensive about their faith. Granted, many Chrisitans are weird fundamentalists too. On the contrary, these terms I've brought up by Islam are active and offensive (not in that they're offensive like they're insulting although they kind of are).

A few illustrative examples:\n\n\nHere is a long article detailing Christian antisemitism, both \"extremist\" and \"mainline,\" and charting how these boundaries are more political than doctrinal:\nhttps://fathomjournal.org/the-jews-are-guilty-christian-antisemitism-in-contemporary-america2/\n\n\nHere is another source, this time non-Jewish, confirming some of the points:\nhttps://wng.org/opinions/why-is-the-religious-left-taking-sides-against-israel-1668775191\n\n\nHere is another article, in a Jewish publication, focusing on a specific mainline denomination:\nhttps://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/israel-zionism/2021/02/the-christian-left-rallies-against-israel/\n\n\nHere is a more succinct summary of at least one broad Jewish perspective on the Christian roots of modern antisemitism, one that doesn't seem the full break you're seeing between historical and modern Christianity:\nhttps://www.ajc.org/news/understanding-the-origins-of-antisemitism\n\n\nHere is an academic article arguing the same thing:\nhttps://www.quest-cdecjournal.it/political-antisemitism-and-its-christian-antecedent-trying-to-make-sense-of-nonsense/\n\n\nI don't disagree that modern Christians in the United States are less likely to be overtly antisemitic than they were in medieval Europe. But that doesn't mean that *Christianity* is not longer a hegemonic, intolerant creed, and that antisemitism still isn't an endemic problem across the Christian spectrum. Plenty of perspectives, both Jewish and non-Jewish, continually re-affirm that it is, and that that is not accident of history but a result of Christianity's foundational texts and doctrines.",

I am applying the western definition of religion in my analysis of Buddhism, and I find that whatever Buddhism is, it isn't that. Whatever Christianity is, Buddhism isn't. You assign too much meaning and importance to the concept of religion. Buddhism is still deeply meaningful to us even though it's not a religion. Buddhism is only classified as a religion because pea-brained Westerners couldn't understand how civilization couldn't function without a religious ideological framework, so they got around it by falsely categorizing Buddhism as a religion. Buddhism is more than a religion, it's a way of life. But it's not a religion, and this is a point in Buddhism's favor. You assume we Asians YEARN for religion and think Buddhism being classified as religion is somehow a privilege. It's not. It's a spirituality. Do not try to speak for Asians when you clearly aren't one, white/black boi.\n\nEDIT: Bro Buddhism was originally meant as a literal DLC for Hinduism to mend the injustices of the caste system. Never even tried to form their own religion in the first place. We don't practice Buddhism the same way Islam or Christianity is practiced, nor do we want to. It's all about deeds, faith is not a requirement. If a Buddhist and Christian live life exactly the same with the only difference being in faith, they will still have the same outcome. We don't have a fucking God or a fucking prophet. The spiritual elements of Buddhism come from mixing with local spiritual traditions. If you look at the spiritual elements of Buddhism across countries and even within countries it's TOTALLY different. Do more research.",

Southeast Asians or Westernized Asian might identify Buddhism as a religion because that was imposed on them by colonizers. I know Thailand wasn't colonized, but it's heavily influenced by English and especially French colonial regimes. I hope you know Vietnam was colonized by French. You can agree that the winners write history and define things. The winners are obviously Europeans. THEY defined Buddhism as a religion because religion was a key part in their definition of society. To admit Buddhism was not a religion was to admit religion is not needed for society. Westernized Asians will call Buddhism a religion because, in accordance with Western values, they place a high value on the classification of a religion. Religions are shit, and Buddhism is not a religion. It's so much more than that. It's literally the way in which we exist and behave. I take extreme offense to classifying Buddhism in the same category as Islam or Christianity.",

I agree if we look at religions through that lense then Buddhism wouldn't qualify. But then neither would basically any non deistic belief system.\n\nI personally subscribe to a more inclusive idea of what a deity can be, and in turn a more inclusive view of what religions are.\n\nIts also why i used a sociological defintion of relgion instead of the more common colloqial definition.",

Issues like war fall into the more complex areas and should only be understood in the proper context after grasping the fundamentals.\n\nA religion that guides every aspect of life, constantly commands its followers to do good and forbid evil, and is centered around a God who calls Himself Merciful and Just, tells its followers to rape?

I know Zoroastrianism seems to permit incest to some degree, but idk if that was standard practice or a byproduct of depopulation following the Islamic conquest and cultural genocide. However, Zoroastrianism also explicitly condemns slavery and promotes the idea that non believers can achieve salvation since salvation is contingent on deeds rather than faith, which I think trumps leniency on incest. I also think Buddhism is generally moral, though a) I'm biased cuz I was raised Buddhist and b) I don't consider it a religion.",

Sure, an individual may choose to view themselves as a \"revert\" in humility and joy, but that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that this term can be patronizing and dismissive of their previous beliefs. It frames their past faith or worldview as an error, a deviation from their \"true\" nature, which undermines the validity of their own journey and experiences. It doesn't allow for their past beliefs to stand as legitimate and equal to the faith they've chosen now\u2014it essentially reduces their former identity to something incomplete or false. While everyone has the right to self-identify, the term \"revert\" isn\u2019t just a personal label\u2014it\u2019s used in a broader cultural and religious context where it implies that non-Muslims are inherently lost or misguided. This framing is not about personal choice; it's about imposing an idea of superiority, which is what makes it feel condescending and entitled to those outside of Islam.\n\nJust because an individual labels themselves as something out of personal choice, it doesn't mean it's not condescending or means we all have to respect that.",

This is exactly what I was saying.\"\n\nThis is very wrong. Here are a few concepts:\n\n* Slavery: Slavery was practiced within Islamic societies for centuries, including the use of enslaved Africans, Europeans, and Asians. While slavery is universally condemned today, it was once normalized within Islamic empires. Some modern-day interpretations continue to defend aspects of historical slavery within Islamic tradition, though it's largely abolished now.\n* Jizya Tax: The practice of imposing a special tax on non-Muslims (dhimmis) living in Islamic empires has been historically contentious. While some scholars argue it was a protective measure, others criticize it as discriminatory. This practice has been largely abolished but remains a point of discussion in contemporary Islamic politics.\n* Sharia Law and Punishments: Harsh corporal punishments such as stoning, amputations, and flogging, which are part of traditional interpretations of Sharia, have been a longstanding issue. Despite widespread international condemnation, some regions still practice these punishments, and the legal system is still heavily influenced by Sharia in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and parts of Somalia.\n* The Treatment of Women: Practices like forced marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage, and restrictions on women\u2019s rights in certain countries have been linked to certain interpretations of Islam. Although there are modern efforts to challenge these practices, they persist in some societies where religious justifications are used to defend them.\n* Religious Intolerance: While many Islamic teachings preach tolerance, there have been instances of religious persecution throughout history, including the forced conversion of non-Muslims, destruction of religious sites, and violence against religious minorities like Jews, Christians, and Hindus. The ongoing persecution of religious minorities like Yazidis, Hindus, and Christians in some Muslim-majority regions still reflects this issue.\n* Apostasy and Blasphemy Laws: In many Islamic-majority countries, apostasy (leaving Islam) and blasphemy (insulting Islam or the Prophet) are still considered crimes, sometimes punishable by death or imprisonment. These laws, often rooted in historical interpretations of Sharia, are fiercely defended in some societies despite being widely seen as human rights violations.\n* Historical Conquest and Violence: Islamic empires, particularly during their expansions (such as the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans), were marked by violence, conquest, and forced conversions. While these events are often seen through the lens of imperialism, some still defend these actions as part of the \"spread of Islam,\" even when they involved atrocities like massacres of civilians or suppression of indigenous cultures.\n* Militant Islamism: The rise of extremist groups that claim to represent Islam, like ISIS and Al-Qaeda, has led to large-scale atrocities such as beheadings, suicide bombings, and other acts of terror. While many Muslims vehemently reject these groups, the use of violence in the name of Islam remains a contentious issue that continues to divide the global Muslim community.\n\n  \nI agree muslims in the west are no different from christian fundamentalists, but I think one, at least in a European context, is worse than the other. I'm a Chiense-Korean living in the US, but have cousins in Sweden, so I've frequently been to Sweden or France or England to meet with them and they've been here, and I feel like that while I'm no expert on European affairs, it's evident that radical Islam is a major issue across the pond.",

The protestant reformation wasn't sparked by a grand geopolitical event, it was because one dude had 95 reasons he disagreed with the pope. same goes for the reason the Orthodox and Catholic churches split up, it was because over time, people in different settings gradually interperetted Christianity differently. The council of Trent was a sudden reformation driven by a sudden geopolitical development, the Protestant Reformation itself, but most reformations are processes that are self reflections on theological interpretations or the history of faith. Historically, Islam HAS comitted various attrocities that would absolutely warrant reformation. Their own fucking prophet massacred and subjugated Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and Polytheists across the middle east. No, the \"dhimmi system\" is not human. Historical context does not justify this because a) a prophet should be a universal standard for morality and b) leaders like Ashoka Maurya and Cyrus the Great were able to govern with respect to human rights and cultural diversity. Idk why you're saying that in Islam's almsot 2,000 years of existance it hasn't been exposed to grand massive paradigm shifts of geopolitical eruptions.",

Spanish and Portugese empires on the other hand were\n\nIm glad you acknowledge the role it played in Spanish and Portuguese conquest, and I\u2019ll agree that it was less so in the more modern cases as those governments became more secular. Which goes to my broader point. Christianity didn\u2019t change, the material and social conditions changed in Europe. But the laws of geo politics remain even as the countries become more secular. That\u2019s my whole point, a Christian country will use Christianity to justify its war, a secular democracy will use democracy and human rights, a communist country will be spreading the workers revolution. Governments do bad things because that\u2019s what governments do. It\u2019s not the fault of Christianity or democracy or communism.\n\n>\u00a0Nazis was not 100% a Christian movement, many actually identified with Islam, and saying Christian clergy supported it is ahistorical\n\nI don\u2019t want to get too deep in the weeds here. It\u2019s debatable whether nazi leadership was christian. I tend to argue yes and that arguing no is a no true Scotsman fallacy but given some of the pagan obsessions among the SS specifically I can see the alternative. That being said the German people were most certainly Christian and couched the war in Christian terms.\n\u00a0\nAs for clergy supporting it, it\u2019s not my word, it\u2019s literally the Catholic Church who has apologized for its complicity.\u00a0https://www.timesofisrael.com/german-bishops-said-to-admit-complicity-in-nazi-actions-in-new-report/amp/\n\nHitler often made references to divine providence and the Nazis framed their war in the east as a holy crusade. There was also the nazi movement for \u201cpositive Christianity\u201d\u00a0https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Christianity\n\nHowever other Christians were led by their same faith to oppose the Nazis and the holocaust. While some catholic priests assisted the Nazis in rounding up Jews because of their \u201cblood guilt\u201d others stood side by side with Jews in the camps for resisting. People are people, people have religions, but people are gonna do what they\u2019re gonna do regardless.\n\n>\u00a0but the thing is Christian theologians have fully codnemned it today, and the Bible never explicitly supports slavery. Islam, on the other hand, not only permits slavery but also the rape of slaves\n\nAgain this is not a full picture. There are Christians opposing slavery going back to the 1400\u2019s like Bartolomeo de las Casas. But Christianity was also the justification used for slavery. The Bible says there is no man or woman Greek or Jew slave or freeman. But it also says slaves ought to obey their masters, what the rules on beating one\u2019s slave should be, it commands a runaway slave to return to his master and serve him well, it permits men to take sex slaves in conquest. Abolitionists and slavery advocates used the Bible to justify slavery and they were both right because an ideology is made up of individuals with their own subjective personal interpretations.\n\nWhich Islamic majority country wasn\u2019t imperialized and subjected to exploitation since the early modern period? Poor undeveloped countries are going to act differently than modern industrialized ones regardless of what religion is prevalent. If you go to parts of Christian sub Saharan Africa you\u2019ll see much of the nasty stuff you see in places like \u00a0Afghanistan because both have been subject to violent wars and imperialism.\n\n\n\u00a0",

Sorry, I consider Byzantine empire separate from Roman empire, ik the Byzantine empire obviously had its origins in the Roman empire but ultimately I think the theocratic distinction, different system of government, and new territorial markings warrant a definitive separation between the two.\n\n2. Yeah sure. I still don't think the British or Belgian empires were motivated so much by religious nationalism than civic nationalism, but I think its an argument that can be had. I do absolutely agree with the rest of what you say here.\n\n3. I do know the Nazis used religious imagery, but I feel like religion was used in the same vein \"socialism\" was used, to attract the common man rather than be a direct reflection of their core values and policy. I actually didn't know the German clergy was complicit, but I knew the Vatican wasn't.\n\n4. That's true. Ultimately, I had hoped the argument wouldn't start revolving around Christianity, but it did and it's fine. I do agree colonialism's view is worth looking into, and more than that political intervention, but problems with Islam root for me within Mohammad's massacres of Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and polytheists when he expanded the Caliphate. Of course Christians have committed several atrocities, the earliest I can think of is Battle of Kleidion when the Byzantine empire massacred and blinded tons of Bulgars, but this took place way after Jesus died (or was resurrected if that's what you personally believe), but the early attrocities of Islam was committed directly by Mohamamd himself.",

The most fundamentalist regimes are really just the most dictatorial and use a facade of fundamentalism to maintain more control. There are certainly evils done in the name of religion, but the majority of violence is more political than religious.\n\n\nThe core problem I still see is that you're trying to have it both ways, where Islam is inherently violent and any talk of it being a religion of peace is inherently deceptive, while you're saying the opposite for another religion with a nearly identical history. The only difference I see is race, but if you can clarify why the standard is different for Christianity than Islam, I'm interested to hear it.\u00a0",

The reason Jews and Christians are more tolerated in Islam than, say, Hindus is simply because their religions are considered less severe corruptions of Islam. Christianity is a bit different in that Jesus\u2019 message is seen as a historical event that changes everything, not a return to some original truth, but that message is still supposed to be spread everywhere and apply to everyone.\u00a0\n\nYahweh\u2019s believers fundamentally think all other gods are fake and they hold the only truth, why would they value pluralism and respect for other faiths?

Or is there a specific reason you're singling out Islam?",

I mean, maybe. But I've also seen statistics like 70% of British mosques teach jihad. \n\nAll Muslims in some shape or form are taught and practice jihad, that it has a different meaning to Muslims than it does to (for lack of a better word) allows for a lot of smoke and mirror bullshit.\n\nI'd be far more willing to accept any of these statistics if they used concrete terms and not post 9/11 non-words that have been hollowed out in terms of meaning.\n\n>The Emirati foreign minister said Europe will soon have more radicals than the Middle East. It's a scary problem. \n\nI am not exactly aware of the quote, but again, I'm far less threatened by this issue when there are other sets of religious radicals currently running the governments of multiple countries. I'm not trying to discount the issue mind you, just to point out it's not islam exclusive.\n\n>2.

Your argument sucks.\n\nYour caliphate glazing is so stupid I'm not even going to address it. Fine, I will. Nobody liked the Umayyad caliphate. It did NOTHING in terms of intellectual flourishing and cultural development. It was a racist ethno-state that served only one religion and one ethnic group, being Muslim penninsular Arabs. If you weren't a Msulim penninsular Arab, you couldn't participate in government. You were taxes, oppressed, and treated as second class citizens after being brutally massacred. Look at what happened to the Zoroastrians. Cultural genocide. It wasn't until the Persians, Levantines, Berbers, and Turks overthrew the Ummayyad caliphate and established the Abbassid caliphate, that used a copy and paste version of Persian government, that the cultural development you described began.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about who was massacred the most times but having the audacity to sit behind a screen and pouting over reverts are condescending is beyond disgusting and cringe.\"\n\nWhy?

I never said Islam is \u201cjust\u201d a religion of peace. I said it\u2019s a whole ideology\u2014one that shaped entire civilizations, advanced science, and led to one of the greatest intellectual movements in history. Islam doesn\u2019t need to be labeled as a \u201creligion of peace\u201d in the way you think because it\u2019s more than that\u2014it\u2019s a system that encompasses governance, law, ethics, and knowledge. You act like my argument was just \u201cMuslims got massacred too,\u201d but in reality, I was pointing out the hypocrisy of acting like Islam is uniquely violent while ignoring the endless massacres and genocides committed against Muslims.\n\nNow, about your ridiculous caliphate take:\n\n1. The Umayyads did nothing for intellectual progress?\nThat\u2019s objectively false. While it\u2019s true that the Abbasids are more famous for their cultural achievements, the foundation was laid during the Umayyad era. Ever heard of Al-Andalus? The Umayyads in Spain turned C\u00f3rdoba into one of the most advanced cities in the world, with libraries, universities, and a thriving multicultural intellectual scene. Even in the Eastern Umayyad empire, they expanded infrastructure, encouraged trade, and established the first true Islamic administrative system. Your claim that they did \u201cNOTHING\u201d is just lazy revisionism.\n\n2. The Umayyads were a \u201cracist ethno-state\u201d?\nThis is such a weak argument. Yes, early on, they had policies that favored Arab Muslims, but Islam itself rejects racism, which is why the system evolved. The fact that Persians, Berbers, and other non-Arabs eventually gained power within the Islamic world proves this. You\u2019re conveniently ignoring that non-Arabs played a major role in governance even before the Abbasids. Also, do you think other empires at the time were somehow more inclusive? The Byzantine and Persian empires had deeply discriminatory systems based on class and religion. The Umayyads weren\u2019t perfect, but calling them a \u201cracist ethno-state\u201d just shows a complete lack of historical context.\n\n3. \u201cThe Abbasids copied Persian governance\u201d\nAnd? Every empire builds upon the knowledge of previous ones. The Abbasids synthesized Persian, Greek, and Indian knowledge into an advanced Islamic civilization. The fact that they were able to do so shows Islam\u2019s strength as a unifying force. Unlike Europe, which destroyed knowledge after Rome fell, the Islamic world preserved and expanded on it. So if your argument is that the Abbasids borrowed ideas, congratulations! you just proved that Islamic civilization was open to knowledge from all sources, which is exactly why it became so advanced.\n\n4. \u201cNobody liked the Umayyads\u201d\nThis is just nonsense. If \u201cnobody liked them,\u201d how did they rule for almost 100 years and expand the empire across three continents? Of course, they had opposition, like any ruling power, but acting like they were universally hated is just dishonest. Even after the Abbasids overthrew them, the Umayyad dynasty continued in Spain for another 300 years, leading to a golden age of science, medicine, and philosophy. Clearly, someone liked them.\n\n5. \u201cMuslims didn\u2019t invent anything\u201d\nThis is where your argument falls apart completely. The Islamic world produced groundbreaking advancements in:\n\n\nMathematics (Al-Khwarizmi, the father of algebra\u2014literally named after him)\n\n\nMedicine (Ibn Sina\u2019s Canon of Medicine was a medical textbook in Europe for centuries)\n\n\nAstronomy (Al-Zarqali\u2019s astronomical tables influenced European science)\n\n\nEngineering (Advancements in hydraulics, optics, and architecture)\n\n\nPhilosophy (Al-Farabi, Ibn Rushd\u2014who literally influenced European thought)\n\nAnd the list goes on. Your attempt to downplay this is just embarrassing.\n\nAt the end of the day, your entire argument boils down to nitpicking certain historical events while ignoring the bigger picture. Islam produced civilizations that were far ahead of their time in science, culture, and governance. Instead of actually engaging with history, you\u2019re just throwing out the same tired talking points that have been debunked a million times. Maybe instead of ranting about \u201ccaliphate glazing,\u201d you should go read a book and get educated",

Let me go through all your points.\n\n1. Al-Andalus's advancements are interesting, especially because they were influenced more so by the rediscover of Greek and Roman science. They did admittedly create a lot of advancements, but it's a) not directly tied to Islamic theology and b) was arguably more influential after Ummayyads.\n\n2.Persians, Berbers, Levantines, and Turks only gained power AFTER OVERTHROWING THE UMMAYADS AND ESTABLISHING THE ABBASID CALIPHATE. Byzantines were racist and theocratic, so were Sassanids to an extent though not to that of the Ummayyads. However, we also have examples of empires, like the Achaemenid empire and Mauryan empire, who DID NOT DO THAT SHIT, so there truly isn't an excuse, especially for an empire that's revered a universal moral beacon that should be emulated.\n\n3. They appropriated the government and culture of a conquered people and deprived them of political representation. THAT'S the problem. Umayyad exclusive additions included jizya and dhimmi status, great additions Ummayyads! I love oppression!\n\n4. War and conquest obviously.\n\n5.

Let me break it down:\n\n1. On Al-Andalus and its advancements:\nYou said that Al-Andalus\u2019s advancements were just about the rediscovery of Greek and Roman science, but that doesn\u2019t give the full credit where it\u2019s due. Sure, there was influence from earlier civilizations, but to call it a \u201crediscovery\u201d is to sell short what actually happened. Scholars like Ibn Rushd (Averroes) didn\u2019t just preserve Aristotle\u2019s work\u2014they critiqued, expanded, and made it relevant to Islamic thought, which later shaped European philosophy. Al-Andalus wasn\u2019t just about re-reading ancient knowledge; it was about creating new ideas in philosophy, medicine, and astronomy that went far beyond the original Greek and Roman works. And let\u2019s not forget that in Islam, knowledge (ilm) isn\u2019t just academic\u2014it\u2019s part of the very essence of faith. The pursuit of understanding the world, through the lens of religion, played a massive role in fueling these intellectual achievements.\n\n2.The Abbasids and the Umayyads:\nYou mentioned that the Persians, Berbers, Levantines, and Turks gained power only after the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads. That\u2019s true to an extent, but let\u2019s not act like the Umayyads were simply a homogenous, exclusionary empire. Non-Arabs, like Bilal ibn Rabah, an African former slave, held prominent roles from the start. The Umayyads, for all their flaws, were instrumental in laying the groundwork for what came after them. The Abbasids may have shifted the balance of power, but the Umayyads set the stage for an intellectual and cultural boom that couldn\u2019t have happened without them. To reduce the Umayyads to just conquerors without acknowledging their contributions is to miss a huge part of the story.\n\n3.Jizya and Dhimmi System:\nYour take on the jizya and dhimmi status is a bit one-sided. These systems weren\u2019t about oppression in the modern sense\u2014they were about protection and coexistence. Non-Muslims paid the jizya tax in exchange for exemption from military service and guaranteed safety. In a time when non-Christians and non-Zoroastrians were often treated harshly under Byzantine and Persian rule, this system was relatively progressive. Sure, it wasn\u2019t perfect, but comparing it to modern-day oppression is anachronistic. We can critique systems without ignoring the broader historical context in which they existed.\n\n4.On Inventions and Contributions:\nAs for your comment about me misrepresenting your views on inventions, let\u2019s clear that up. I never said you denied Muslim contributions to science. What I was pointing out was how easily the Umayyads\u2019 contributions are overlooked in favor of the Abbasids. The Umayyads helped lay the intellectual and cultural foundation for the flourishing that came later. Dismissing their role in history is unfair to the legacy they built.\n\nSo, while I understand you\u2019re trying to make a point, I think you\u2019re simplifying a much more complex and nuanced history. The contributions of the Islamic world, particularly during the Umayyad period, aren\u2019t just about conquest they\u2019re about a rich tapestry of intellectual, cultural, and scientific achievements that shaped the world in ways that we\u2019re still feeling today",

I think most of their achievements were actually probably during Umayyad rule. I oversimplified. !delta\n\n2. I can see that, but the fact remains that Persians, Egyptians, Kurds, Berbers, Syrians, etc were all still very unhappy with Umayyad rule. This stems from lack of political representation and equal treatment in comparison to the peninsular Arabs. this is why they were ultimately overthrown. I think credit can be given to the Umayyads for setting up the stage for the Islamic golden age that occured during the Abbasid caliphate, but so did the Persian, Indian, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman societies. I contend that the Islamic Golden age was a byproduct of a crossing over of cultures and societies, and Umayyad's primarily exclusionary structures are fully removed from that development.\n\n3. But the fact remains that under the Umayyads, those considered dhimmis still had many legal rights restricted in courts, servitude, economic rights, etc. I think what happened to Zoroastrians clearly demonstrates how harsh this was. They were not considered people of the book, and as a result faced more restrictions and oppression. Iran went from around 90% Zoroastrian immediately before Islamic conquest to being 5% Zoroastrian by the fall of the Umayyads. This is shocking. Sure you could say that the Sassanids enforced Zoroastrianism, but that's a debatable claim and it's likely they would have been Zoroastrians anyways. Regardless, the Achaemenid and Parthian empires created excellent policies on cultural tolerance previously. We can also see this in India, when Mehmed of Ghazni's conquest and the establishment of the Delhi sultanate ruined Buddhism in North India, though this is unrelated to the Calipahte.\n\n4. Sorry, I interpreted this part of your argument: \"'Muslims didn\u2019t invent anything' This is where your argument falls apart completely. The Islamic world produced groundbreaking advancements in:\" as you claiming I directly said muslims didn't invent anything since that part was in quotes.",

            "body": "You\u2019re loading the term a bit. \n\n1. The root word of the religion is from peace in Arabic. It\u2019s how Muslims greet each other even. \n\n2. Many muslims will gladly tell you that you should fight against oppression. It\u2019s not peaceful but it\u2019s predicated on finding peace.\n\n3. A core belief that pretty much defines the religion is that God is one. That means God has no body parts, no division, and there are no idols to worship. People were persecuted for their worship of different Gods and the religion sought to change this, hoping to find peace in unity. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason, in my opinion, to believe that peace refers to methodology. Ultimately any religion, even Buddhism, is a set of idealistic metaphysical principles that prescribe normative actions. Some are more prescriptive than others, but the principle ideal in this case is a real peace rather than one maintained by persecution.\n\n\nI do think Muslims discuss in a way that is confrontational, but as you\u2019ve pointed out everybody assumes their belief is correct. That\u2019s an implied superiority. Expressing it is rude in that it\u2019s awkward but nothing new is imposed. Just because someone says revert doesn\u2019t mean they want you to be compelled to accept their belief as truth. They won\u2019t follow you home preaching.  It\u2019s the same belief in one\u2019s principles that people of other faiths have. This is just language which expresses that.",

But I think that\u2019s a bit far-fetched. \n\nNot only is the violent history quite well recorded and studied, but the idea of absolute peace in any community on this planet is unheard of. Even Quakers, known for a firm commitment to peace, have participated in conflicts in the name of ending them and establishing peace. So, holding them absolutely to that title doesn\u2019t really make sense.\n\nThere\u2019s no effort to conceal or hide it by Muslims. God is one and we\u2019re not God, so we\u2019re divided and imperfect and prone to conflict. The Qur\u2019an talks about war, as does the Hadith. It\u2019s not a cover up campaign to manipulate people into thinking there\u2019s no violence. \n\nI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s struggling to try and reconcile a title that people have given the religion with the idea that it\u2019s not absolutely that title. \n\nMaybe you mean something else by condense? But that\u2019s my interpretation of your question. \n\nA religion of peace can be a religion about peace. It can be a religion that operates peacefully, it can be a religion whose goal is peace. You may think it\u2019s ironic that they\u2019ve decided the way to peace is through violence, but I don\u2019t think that makes the title less appropriate.",

During World War I, the Ottoman Empire was at war with the Russian Empire, and many Armenian nationalist groups aligned themselves with Russia, hoping to gain independence from Ottoman rule. Armenian militias, particularly the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), actively collaborated with the Russian army and carried out attacks against Ottoman forces and Muslim civilians in eastern Anatolia. These groups engaged in massacres and ethnic violence, killing and expelling Muslim populations, and reports of rape, looting, and destruction of villages were widespread.\n\nIn response, the Ottoman government saw Armenians as a security threat and began deporting them from war zones, which later escalated into mass killings and suffering. I can admit it was tragic but it was not a simple case of unprovoked genocide it was complex conflict involving war, political alliances, and retaliatory violence from both sides. \n\nSo I think you need to understand history a bit more and not just comment on something you have no knowledge about\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

These Papal Bulls were a continuation of what had been going on since at least the 8th century from Charlemagne, through the Crusades, the Inquisition, the war on witches, to the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula. In 1823, the \u201cDoctrine of Discovery\u201d was first articulated as a legal formulation in U.S. Supreme Court case, Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh in 1823. As this case fundamentally defines international property law today, it continues to be used by multi-national corporations and Nation-States in their extraction of resources in indigenous territories around the world. The global scale with which the DoCD expressed itself in the \u201cAge of Discovery\u201d\u2014first in Africa, then the Americas, and beyond\u2014created a unified Christendom, which became the opposing force against the great global plurality of cultures.\"\n\n\n\nhttps://doctrineofdiscovery.org/what-is-the-doctrine-of-discovery/",

This offers an interesting perspective on Christianity, and demonstrates how it deserves criticism, but unfortunately is not related to Islam which is what my post is about. Please stick to the prompt. I am not Christian and have criticized Christianity in the past so this isn't really proving anything.",
