    "selftext": "This is the biggest thing fueling my anxiety and fear for the future and I've been thinking a lot on this topic. So, this is going to be a long one. TL;DR is at the end.\n\nThe wealth gap is at it's widest and AI is developing rapidly. Despite some people arguing that the development of AI is plateauing, it's going to get much, much worse. Meanwhile in US, the Silicon Valley technocrats took over the government with the promise of \"reducing the size of the government\" and they're blatantly turning US into an oligarchy.\n\nWe're not-so-slowly but definitely surely moving towards a techno-feudalism era.\n\nElon Musk is the elephant in the room in this matter. He has a space company that builds rockets with the promise of \"taking humanity to Mars\" but keeps sending Starlink satellites around the globe. He's currently at \\~10.000, that's 27 satellites per meridian. Even if these satellites are truly only for communication purposes, that makes him the owner of the biggest communication network around the entire world, by far; which grants him access to an ungodly amount of data.\n\nOn the other hand, he has a car company, which in reality is actually a data company. Every mile a Tesla drives, he collects every possible data point he can collect of that mile. Entire neighborhoods and cities are being modeled in 1:1 scale through the lenses and sensors of Tesla's and all of that data is in the palm of his hand.\n\nHe also has this little side-hustle of his, called Neuralink which he openly talks about as a way of \"increasing the rate and speed of data flow between humans and machines\". He talks about fixing permanent nerve damages in an utopian way but his real motivation is just getting more and more data by directly interfacing with the human brain.\n\nOn top of that, he is the sole owner of one of the biggest social media platforms in the world. He has access to the collective consciousness of 300 to 400 million people. That's an unfathomable amount of data which he uses to train his own AI company xAI's product, Grok. I don't even need to mention his part in OpenAI in the past.\n\nHe's been talking about AGI and ASI (artificial general/super intelligence), UBI (universal basic income) and \"expanding the human consciousness\" for as long as he's been around.\n\nWhat does all of these mean in the end? Why would someone hoard so much data, get involved with politicians and leaders of the biggest economies of the world and be so provacative in social media?\n\nAI is going to change everything. There is a reason why there are trillions of dollars are being burned to push the advent of AI. Many are already losing their jobs to it, and those who do not are either has to do cheaper work in or utilize it as a tool to keep earning the same amounts before or more.\n\nAlongside with AI, the quantum computer technology is slowly coming together too. I can't imagine how fast and powerful AI could get if it's combined with quantum computers.\n\nElon knows AI is inevitable. Not only him, but all of his technocrat friends and all the other billionaires know this too. Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Donald Trump, and every other name you can think of. They're not competitors, they're the builders of a new world order and in on it all together. If they don't do it, someone else like China will do it and win the nuclear race. This is Oppenheimer all over again, but this time it's much worse than building bombs.\n\nFeudalism can be seen in many parts of the history. There are no lower, middle or upper classes in feudalism. There are only land owners and peasants. There is no climbing up the ladder of social hierarchy. There is no bootstrapping yourself. You, your kids, your grandchildren and your great grandchildren are obligated to do work for land owners. Kings, landlords, emperors, tyrants, whatever you call it. There are those, and then there is you.\n\nNow is the time for techno-feudalism.\n\nCapitalism is crumbling apart. You might not see it, you might not want to accept it, but it is. It's no longer sustainable, there are financiel crises all over the world, non-stop. Economic growth is only sustainable by inflation, but constant rise of inflation makes everything else unsustainable for the ordinary people, who are keeping the machine running.\n\nNow, whoever has the most land in the digital world, has the most power. Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, X, Tesla, OpenAI and all of the others are \"digital lands\".\n\nThis is a quote from an article from 2024 about Sam Altman on UBI:\n\n>Earlier this year, Altman also floated another kind of basic-income plan, which he called a \"universal basic compute.\" In this scenario, Altman said, people would get a \"slice\" of the computational resources of the large language model GPT-7, which they could use however they liked.\n\nThey're going to own the land and give you \"rewards\" for working the land. It's already happening.\n\nBecome a content creator on your choice of social media platform and get paid by providing more advertisement space for the land owner.\n\nProvide your computational resources for an AI company and get paid by increasing the speed of service for the land owner.\n\nStake your tokens for a blockchain network and get paid by helping the network run smoothly.\n\nBuying is not owning anymore. We're renting and lending everything. Home ownership rate is plummeting, starting a business and becoming and entrepreneur is getting increasingly harder, constantly rising inflation is making stock market only a saving tool. The era of bootstrapping yourself and climbing the social ladder is over. The class war is won by the technocrats. People are losing.\n\nI don't know if I'm overthinking it. I really don't. But I'm scared for my future kids. I want to be wrong about all of this but I can't think of any other reason for so many billionaires to spend so many of their precious dollars on something. I need my view on this to be changed or at least challenged, just so I can have a little peace about the future.\n\nTL;DR  \nClass war is over and technocrats won. There will be no more climbing up the social hierarchy. AI and quantum computers are going to break the system and the rich knows it so they rush it to be the biggest \"land owners\" of a techno-feudalism order.",

Who says the bottom part of the population will not be given a comfortable way to live, out of pure necessity to keep them docile and content? Give them a roof over their head. Give them tranquilizers. Give them surrogate activities. Give them a conditional welfare. All of which would go down the drain if you would bite the hand that feeds you. Don't underestimate the amount of people who would settle with a tiny space to live in, with an endless stream of online entertainment, and escapism to drugs... \n\nOn top of that, you seem to underestimate the power of technology and surveillance. The dynamic of human communities, and the biological laws that dictate what we are, are not made of the same clay as the logical binary and machinery that our modern society relies on. It might very well be, that technology will get a permanent upper hand over us, and resistance will simply become futile.

First, the universal conditional welfare has not came true yet. Right now some people is starving in this world. And second, there are people who would prefer fight until death rather than living in the Matrix.\n\nOn top of that, you seem to have little idea of what a futuristic class war look like. Maybe \"two gang of guys rushing into each other with their finest weapon\" sound very Hollywood, but  remember, every community will have some degree of economic or power disparity. \"the rich\", \"not that rich\", \"the poor\", \"not that poor\", \"the rich who fights for the poor\", \"the poor who fights for money\", \"the middleclass\" and all the others, there will be hundreds and thousands groups in struggle, and the outcome is not that clear.\n\n>That in turn is a fight against civilization itself, and even without one, every community will have some degree of economic or power disparity. \n\n300 years ago people can't imagine living without a king, and even without one, someone will have the biggest power. But then revolution came and the society had changed. So will be the class war, \"8h working day\", \"pension\", \"universal health care\", \"unemployment benefits\", none of these would existed if the working class haven't fought for themselves. And the fight for living with dignity will continue, just like the fight for power will continue. Peace is temporary and the struggle is forever, my friend.\n\n>This post-war reduction in economic inequality ended in the 1980's already.\n\nAnd that will be the cause for round 2.",

The said capitalists are the billionaires, like you said.\n* I'm not saying that they had some secret meeting around a big, circle table in a secret cave in the mountains and decided that they should fuck the entire world. Obviously.\n* I'm very much involved and up to speed with AI. I'm also using it as an umbrella term to avoid more convolution.\n\nNow, I think what you're saying is definitely more evidential because we can clearly see what these people and companies are doing: They're competing. I think if I just simply accept what is visible and not think about what is not, it would be a better option. But that's where I go into the conspiratiorial waters, because we've also seen evidence of malicious actions of these billionaires. They have obviously different personalities behind the closed doors.\n\nZuck, for example. He's an infamous data broker. That has concrete proof. Take Trump on the other hand, his entire history is public. You can read and see what kind of a person he is, what he has done to get where he is, and what he is capable of. Musk is a total joke at this point, I'm not even going to go there.\n\nBill Gates, although still a very humble person who seems pretty much out of the game now, he had his countless controversies. One of them being his ties with Epstein. Now you can say that \"what does that have to do with any of the topics you're talking about\", but I would say you can say a lot about a person's connections and actions, even tho they're irrelevant to the relevant topic.\n\nNone of them are \"people\" anymore. They're all brands. They all represent something and they all have agendas. Some of them might actually be all about business, but I think most of them are not and I understand that. When you have that much power and influence, you'd do what you think would be better for at least a portion of humanity.\n\nThe question here is, in which direction do they believe is the better one to take the humanity to, and how are they taking it towards? And more importantly, are they right? How would they or we know if they're right or not?\n\nI don't think the humanity is doomed. I think we're going to occupy this beautiful planet for many more decades, if not milleniums. But I think the direction of the humanity shouldn't be in the hands of an incredibly small group of people. They're also humans after all. They have feelings and opinions.\n\nApart from a couple of instances, the advancement of humanity has always been a distillation of clashing views and beliefs. It was almost never dependent on a single person or a small group of people with common agendas. It seems different today.\n\nMost of the things I say are my readings, and I certainly can't prove what the billionaires think. But, \"there is proving, and then there is knowing\" is a quote I love from Better Call Saul.\n\nThanks again.",

There isn't a critical bone in his body, all of their text amounts to is a performance of \"seriousness\" through nuance-peddling, that ultimately aims to muddy the waters in the service of the status quo. Essentially, the droll hum of neoliberalism. Daily, the rich conspire to further their wealth, however this is a normalised conspiracy. This is their function as dictated by our economies current mode of production - Capitalism. Under Capitalism, billionaires represent the unprecedented heights this gross accumulation has reached. The only innovations billionaires represent is how to more efficiently accumulate this wealth. Any potential advances will be robbed of their progressive potential due to the profit motive. Any philanthropy is a veiled attempt of disaster capitalism to privatise government resources to their own ends. Free healthcare cannot exist if it cannot create a profit, a renewable transition cannot exist if it cannot create a profit. Democracy cannot exist if their wealth continues to go unchecked, just look at the all inclusive access Musk has to Trump, thanks to his ownership of one of the largest communication websites. We must be clear sighted, their access to the levers of power is at the expense of ours. A society organised by billionaires for billionaires is undemocratic social cannibalism. Don't forget, Capitalism was once a revolutionary force of progress over Monarchy. But just like the divine right of kings this time will soon pass. True democracy can only be fulfilled if we fight for the democratic control of our economic lives. Sadly, this lad is fighting on the frontlines of the class war, he just doesn't know it.",

Sure, they\u2019re involved in major industries, but acting like they\u2019re the reason we have innovation is giving them way too much credit. Progress has always been a collective effort: scientists, workers, and even public funding play a bigger role than these billionaires ever acknowledge. Tesla, SpaceX, and Amazon wouldn\u2019t be where they are without massive government subsidies, taxpayer-funded research, and existing infrastructure. These billionaires didn\u2019t create progress out of thin air; they capitalized on systems that were already in place and made sure they walked away with the biggest slice of the pie.\n\nAnd the idea that \u201chumanity embraced their ideas\u201d is a joke. It\u2019s not like people had a real choice. Facebook didn\u2019t dominate social media because it was the best option, it crushed competition by buying up rivals and locking users in. Microsoft became a tech giant by using monopolistic tactics, not just because it made good software. Amazon manipulates suppliers, undercuts competitors, and treats workers terribly to maintain its dominance. It\u2019s not that these billionaires won because their ideas were the greatest, it\u2019s that they played the game in a way that kept them on top, often at the expense of everyone else.\n\nPeople also love to bring up philanthropy as if that makes everything okay. But if billionaires really wanted to help, they wouldn\u2019t need charity, they\u2019d push for fair wages, better working conditions, and higher taxes on the ultra-rich. Instead, they avoid taxes, exploit workers, and then act like donating a small portion of their wealth makes up for it. Gates, Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg all operate in ways that maximize their own power and control, and whatever \u201cgood\u201d they do is on their terms, with strings attached. That\u2019s not progress, it\u2019s damage control.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real, these guys absolutely have power. The idea that they don\u2019t really control much because they don\u2019t own 100% of their companies is ridiculous. They influence elections, shape policy, control media narratives, and dictate industry standards. They may not \u201ccall all the shots in the world,\u201d but they sure as hell have more say in how things work than the average person.\n\nProgress happens despite billionaires, not because of them. The biggest breakthroughs in history came from collective effort, not a few rich guys sitting at the top. The more we act like we need them to move forward, the more we let them justify their outsized control over our economy and our lives. The truth is, if we had a fairer system, where power and resources were distributed more evenly, we\u2019d still have innovation, probably even more of it, just without a handful of billionaires hoarding all the benefits.",

If that one class is the capitalist class, well then that's probably the worst possible way to end it, considering it would mean the extinction of most of humanity. But it's not impossible. \n\n\"There are no lower, middle or upper classes in feudalism. There are only land owners and peasants.\" This is just absolutely not true, this is not a good understanding of feudalism at all. The \"upper class\" of capitalism is the nobility, royalty, and powerful clergy of feudalism, the lower class are anyone beneath them. The middle classes are, as their name implies, the middle. The necessary managers, merchants, experts, and non-noble asset owners. So right there, your argument is completely ahistorical and incoherent. And to pretend feudalism did not evolve during its hundreds of years as the European means of production is also ignorant. Consider: Feudalism metastasized *into capitalism*. It destroyed itself, as capitalism is now destroying itself. \n\nThe hierarchy of feudalism depended on the inherent belief in the *inequality* of man. This idea was inherited from the pre-existing, stratified slave society. The cycle of reproduction was then interrupted for several hundred years between the crisis of the 3rd Century, the brief resurgence of the Roman Empire under Diocletian and his successors, and then further interruption due to mass population migration, rampant disease, subsequent invasion, civil war, and a general decline in the productivity of labor. This combined with Europe being cut off from its major sources of food as North Africa fell out of its trade network. What was left was the rudimentary slash and burn agriculture of the northern Europeans, and the now nutrient-poor fields of southern Spain, Italy, Dalmatia, etc. Incidentally Diocletian, responding to these multiplying crises, helped legally initiate the process of feudalization *in order to make the reproductive cycle more predictable.* \n\nConstantine absorbed Christianity into this regime in order to assert unquestioned legitimacy from God himself, divine right. And even then, there were countervailing movements, emperors who didn't like the idea that they were divinely appointed. It took centuries for this *specific* idea to gain widespread acceptance. Now, in the modern day, it is impossible to turn back the clock. Basic egalitarianism is an idea so widespread as to be taken as an article of faith, literally, by many people across the globe. You may not see it anywhere you look, we only have the memory of class societies to inform us, but don't we see people questioning Elon's sanity and intelligence, saying they are better suited to rule than him? Is it going to be possible to convince everyone he's the God Emperor? This is what Marx means when he says \"first as tragedy then as farce,\" it can't be anything *but* farce. We can't innovate feudalism because it was already done, to the extent we understand we would like to embody it, we can only imitate it, and that simply makes us ridiculous. Essentially, the memes are not reality. I think he'll probably die of natural causes before anything like that could possibly be achieved, and a course correction will be initiated by capitalists refusing to let their old ways just die.\n\nAI and robots are merely the current ultimate manifestation of labor-saving technology. Labor-saving technology might as well be called \"capital destroying technology,\" for a variety of reasons. As you point out, what we have when we have enough labor-saving technology can no longer be called capitalism. You are imagining that capitalism can go while the hierarchy of capitalism remains, but why would one assume that? After a lot of cajoling and coercion, the royalty of Europe eventually embraced capitalism, and they were all pretty much beheaded or shot within a few hundred years. As it turned out, capitalism didn't need them at all. The future lords of technofeudalism will find themselves just as unnecessary. Their role in capitalism is vital, without labor to buy and capital with which to invest, they lose their safe place in the social strata. \n\nIn the short term the rich may win, I must concede that.",

I don't know exactly what his childhood was like, maybe he owned a emerald mine, but he was not the son of a super elite man.  He moved up on the socio economic ladder.   Some people move up on that ladder and some move down.  Eddie Lampert (majority owner and CEO of sears) decent enough example of someone moving down.\n\nI think its pretty rare to move dramatically on the hierarchy.  Going from homeless to billionaire is probably impossible.  But lower middle class to upper middle class is definitely is possible.\n\nAnd it is possible for everyone to move up.  Just ask any America alive today who knows the history of America 100 years ago.  Not literally, but basically everyone is better off today.\n\nI don't think there is a class war.  Rich people don't want to defeat poor people or vice versa.  Most people rich and poor want a rising tide that lifts all boats.",

We have the highest maternal mortality rate among developed countries, for example. We are the only country with a gun violence epidemic where kids are gunned down in schools. We are the only developed country where medical issues lead to bankruptcy. Not only that; our educated population is hyper aware that anything our leaders do has far reaching and drastic consequences across the globe, for good or bad, so we strive to hold our leaders accountable and feel immense despair when fascists are put in charge. \n\nIt has been extremely obvious that far right ideology, fascism, and oligarchy have been on the rise for decades in America.

We tend to lose focus on this class delineation because we tend to only look upwards.  The middle class is the oppressor, has won, and doesn't even realize it.\n\nI come from a working class section of a suburban town.  Mechanics, construction workers, brick layers, garbage men, phlebotomists, and even teachers/nurses- these people are invisible.  These folks are having to move further and further out from city centers because they can't afford it.  They are having to work 2-3 jobs just to get by.  They are essential workers working in-person 60+ hours a week. They are the ones who enable you to have the \"experiences\" you love so much and complain about not being able to afford; they're washing dishes/cooking in the back.  \n\nPolicy is much more supportive for the middle class than it is for these folks.  Middle class folks get free solar panels, subsidized teslas, and various protection programs (e.g. mortgage forbearance); working class folks get basically nothing\\*.  H1-Bs (who bring down the wages of white collar workers) are tightly controlled; while illegal immigrants (who bring down the wages of many working class workers) are everywhere (until recently).  Many middle class folks work in cushy offices and air-conditioning that the working class can only dream of.  Many of these middle class folks complain about having to come to the office more than 3 days a week- what a joke. Personally, I don't think supply and demand explains the pay middle class folks get; I think there's a classist element keeping wages for middle class workers higher than it should be.\n\n\\*People will say the working class need food stamps / welfare benefits. That by voting for Trump, they voted against their interests. No.. they do not want welfare benefits. They want their trades to be valued fairly. They want to be able to live inside the neighborhoods they built.",

Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Tesla, SpaceX, OpenAI and beheamoths like them pushed the humanity at least couple of decades, if not a century forward. That's not something anyone has any right to dismiss.\n\nThat being said, any of this don't change what I've said in the post. They've done good-- an incredible amount of good, but now they seem to be all about having more surveillance and control.\n\nOne could do good things for many but have bad underlying intentions. Stating that is not hating, it's just reading their actions. I might be reading wrong, and I genuinely hope so. But again, it's not coming from a place of hate. I actually admire them.

Chris Hedges explains this so well; this was a war between the corporatists (Democrats) and oligarchs (the current GOP). The oligarchs won.

Corporatists make their money and concentrate their power from the stability of the institutions that solidify and keep power where it is; oligarchs make their money and establish a new regime of control from a chaotic dismantling of that stability. Liberals misperceive the stability of the corporatists as \"flawed democracy, but still democracy\" and rightists of all types, except for perhaps old establishment Republicans, now misperceive the chaos of oligarchs as \"well, at least this is different than what we've been stuck with. It must be moving in a better direction.\" \n\nEveryone is wrong here.",
