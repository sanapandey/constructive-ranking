    "selftext": "Austerity is often articulating in terms of cutting spending in view of avoiding a catastrophic debt level that would harm the economy. However when austerity has been practised the results are less than beneficial:\n\nA) In the UK the Conservative government entered office in 2010 with an austerity programme. Since 2010 the UK has seen the slowest GDP per capita growth in an equivalent period since the Napoloenic Wars. Since 2010 productivity has plunged by 60% and average weekly earnings are only up 4%. Annual GDP growth has been just 1.2% in the years since 2008 and GDP per capita is only roughly equal with 2008 levels. \n\nB) the debt reduction from spending cuts is offset by revenue reductions from economic weakness. Under the \"Estado Novo\" regime in Portugal which had a policy of austerity GDP growth was about 1/4 lower than Spain from 1960 to 1970.\n\nC) Austerity has very unpleasant effects on the less well off (NHS waiting lists have trebled since 2010). Food bank use is up 5,000%, Homelessness up 120%, timely cancer treatment down 32%.",

            "body": "For the record, I generally think austerity is a bad and short-sighted policy, and I'm not going to try and convince you that it's a generally good one, but it may be worth considering whether it's truly *universally* terrible or could never have any useful applications.\n\n\nI would first query whether your examples are rock solid, as there will always be many other additional factors to consider in a country's economic performance. For the UK example, at least, since 2010 the country has also had a lot of other difficulties which have compounded its relatively poor economic performance, including the impact of Brexit, experiencing a bigger economic slump from the pandemic than most of its neighbours and years of government instability having gone through five Prime Ministers since David Cameron's resignation in 2016. (Though interestingly, the UK was also named 2nd in PWC's rankings of countries most attractive for investment earlier this year, and securing foreign investment is definitely an important part of overall economic prospects. Link:\u00a0https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/research-commentary/2024/global-ceos-rank-uk-most-important-market-after-us---pwc-s-28th-.html#:~:text=The%20UK%20has%20risen%20to,year%20history%20of%20the%20survey. )\n\n\nThe impact of Brexit is an interesting example also to cite because the EU actually stipulates that any state seeking to join must not have a budget deficit exceeding 3% of GDP. Membership of the EU has been a major boon for the economies of some countries to the point where it seems conceivable that employing some austerity policies *could* be a worthwhile long-term call if it secured EU membership even if in the short-term it carried undesirable economic costs.\n\n\nSo while I definitely do not think austerity is good or generally desirable, I think I can envisage some scenarios where it might be an acceptable trade-off if the result is presenting a more stable economy to investors. I would be very reluctant to back a government going in big on austerity measures but I don't think you necessarily have to rule it out *completely* and at all times. It's the same as asking \"Does nationalisation work?\" \"Do low interest rates work?\" Etc. The answer is usually \"probably sometimes, depending on the situation.\"",

There comes a point at which a state has accumulated such debts that it has even has to go into debt to just pay the interests of the old ones -- complete economic collapse and severe political instability is the next thing coming up. To avoid such a fate there are sometimes no other measures than austerity (or revolution).",

But you do not even need in depth historical analysis to see the benefits of austerity in many situations, just a little bit of a priori reasoning: when the government can not pay the interest of its debts, you have two options increase revenue or cut spending -- no more to it. (Of course, you could just collapse the government and refuse to pay any debts back like russia in 1917.)",

Without sovereignty there is no economy in any meaningful sense either, just anarchy and/or civil war. So the state has to, much like a severly ill body, sacrifice less important organs to save the essential ones. If you can't pay the police and bureaucrats in Berlin, for example, far-right militias will end the Weimar republic tomorrow. With austerity you have at least postponed it and gave yourself another fighting chance.\n\nAusterity alone can't save a dying economy and state in a fiscal crisis but without austerity the state is gone tomorrow, given a sufficent severity of the economic problem.",

As I\u2019ve written before, and as*\u00a0[*Simon Wren-Lewis*](https://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/greece-and-political-capture-of-imf.html)\u00a0*notes, given the lack of an independent monetary policy achieving a primary surplus requires a lot more than one-for-one austerity. In fact, a good guess is that you\u2019d have to slash spending by 2 percent of GDP, because austerity shrinks the economy and reduces tax receipts. This in turn means that you\u2019d shrink the economy by around 3 percent. So, a 3 percent hit to GDP to raise the primary surplus by 1.*\n\n*But a smaller economy means that the debt/GDP ratio goes up initially. In fact, given Greece\u2019s starting point, with debt at 170 percent of GDP, the adverse effects of austerity mean that trying to raise the primary surplus by 1 point quickly causes the debt-GDP ratio to rise by 5 points (.03\\*170). So this might suggest that it would take 5 years of austerity just to get the debt ratio back to where it would have been in the absence of austerity.*",

So, arguing about whether tax cuts, or tax hikes, or spending cuts, or spending hikes have a better impact is a choice of suboptimal solutions. On top of that, the real life examples have too many variables. \n\nFor instance, Greece spending on social programs, combined with its relative station in the world in terms of economics, and its massive tax evasion issues, creates a type of crisis where austerity versus economic explosion are the choices. But, this doesn't mean an austere fiscal outlook doesn't work - it means that times of crisis lead to bad choices.\n\nIn contrast - if Greece's fiscal policymaking better fit its station in the world stage, or didn't have such bad collections issues, or if its spending spurred growth, then we wouldn't even need to argue about whether austerity works.\n\nI don't typically like analogies but a lot of the recent examples - say from the Great Recession, of austerity implementation was like a fat person ordering a diet coke. There's still severe issues but at least for the time being they staved off a sugar rush.",

It would work fine, except the people most committed to making it happen are the people least likely to do so faithfully. \n\n>A) In the UK the Conservative government entered office in 2010 with an austerity programme. Since 2010 the UK has seen the slowest GDP per capita growth in an equivalent period since the Napoloenic Wars. Since 2010 productivity has plunged by 60% and average weekly earnings are only up 4%. Annual GDP growth has been just 1.2% in the years since 2008 and GDP per capita is only roughly equal with 2008 levels.\n\nUK Conservative government has focused on encouraging the nation's rapidly expanding ~~tax fraud~~ financial services market. The spending wasn't cut, it was reallocated to the financial sector to help the poor innocent bankers meet their annual profits. \n\n>C) Austerity has very unpleasant effects on the less well off (NHS waiting lists have trebled since 2010).
