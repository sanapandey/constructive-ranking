    "selftext": "Young men in America are in a crisis. Study after study shows this. Women are leaving men behind when it comes to education, social mobility, and just about every metric aside from incarceration and a propensity to commit violent crime.\n\nI believe the reason for this is that any young men born after 2008 have had shockingly few positive male role models to look up to and grow up with.\n\nMany young men don't have fathers active in their life. This part isn't new, and it sets them on a path with negative outcomes to begin with. These men will inevitably look to people in their lives such as teachers, coaches, or other family members/family friends. If young men don't have these positive male role models in their lives, they look to public figures.\n\nMany young men do have fathers. Many of their fathers are heroes to them that they look up to. Many of these young men have witnessed their fathers abandon every principle they ever held in obsequence to the worst human America has ever elected as president. Whatever characteristics their fathers might teach their children, they also are teaching them that cruelty, criminality, and poor treatment of women and minorities is acceptable. Even most fathers who don't agree with those principles, who even tell their children to not be those things, are teaching them that very thing through their continued support of those actions. We used to tell kids that actions speak louder than words. They do. \n\nEven if a young man today has a positive role model in their personal life, whether it be a father, a father figure, a coach, a teacher, whatever it may be, as soon as they are old enough to consume their own media they are pushed by social media algorithms to listen/watch some of the worst humans available. Deadbeat Dads, avowed misogynists, accused rapists, domestic abusers, and more of the worst men that America has to offer are beamed directly into their brains as a model of a modern man. \n\nHonor, empathy, integrity, kindness, strength of character, these are all things that make a man a good person. These are things that are found almost nowhere among the current \"manosphere\" or in our public life. This is what is creating what many of these men who now call themselves, incels. Incel's are raised, not born. They're being taught by this manosphere that it is not their fault, but that of women, that they are ignored. These people never had a father figure in their life who told them, \"stop being a horrible person and maybe then women will like you,\" and they desperately need to.\n\nI know this is not all young American men, and I applaud those who have had to raise themselves to be responsible adults despite all the adults telling them to be horrible to others, but it is a majority of young men, who will raise another generation of young men. \n\nPlease change my view, and I'd especially be interested in hearing from those young men who have made it to adulthood while casting off the forces of society attempting to turn them against their fellow citizens.",

That at least on the left, there was a significant change. \n\nI think it's a LOT more complicated than that, to be clear. It's like a jenga puzzle of sorts, with blocks being pulled out and eventually the entire structure topples. The rise of algo-based social media just being the one that happened to send everything askew. \n\nTo be clear, I actually don't think the problem is a lack of male role models. I think there's a lack of understanding how the entire idea of what we traditionally think of as a role model fits into the Men as Oppressor concept. And I think more so, what the fuck men are supposed to do surrounding that concept.",

Is your argument that it would be better for boys to grow up in a world that pretends bad men are good men?\n\nAbsolutely! In the same way that amputating a gangrenous leg hurts you. It had to be done, and it will inevitably lead to a better outcome. But you can't honestly tell me it didn't tarnish the very concept of masculinity. \n\nFurthermore, role models don't inspire by who they are behind closed doors, they inspire by who they present as publicly. If Lance Armstrong is my role model and I have no idea he used PEDs, then I am not patterning myself after the Lance Armstrong who takes steroids. Once I find out that he took steroids, there is always a chance that this this actually inspires me to do the same, because now I know my hero did.\n\nAnd yes. I pick Marvel movies. Super heroes are the quintessential male role model and have been since before the genre even existed. David from the Bible/Torah/Koran is an example of this. So is Hercules, Maui, and Sun Wukong. They illustrate the importance of using your strengths responsibly for the benefit of others, for standing up for those who don't have the same strengths as yours. \n\nOf those Marvel movies, I will give you Spiderman and maybe Shang Chi. But Thor and Dr. Strange were both movies where a female character was supplanting an established male character as the key protagonist. It was my understanding that in Ant-man it was similar, though I haven't seen it. Deadpool and Wolverine definitely didn't create male role models at all. They are anti-heros aimed at an older audience.\n\nI'm not saying that Hollywood doesn't have enough male leads, obviously that's not the case. I also agree with the importance of more female role models in media, especially that aren't the classic Disney Princess damsel in distress. Your snark is not a nessesity in this discussion. I'm happy that we have more female heroines and stronger female characters.\n\nIt's just that the male characters in modern media are often in a position of apologizing for their maleness. They are often depicted as bumbling buffoons or incompetent. The modern male archetype should respect women without apologizing for being male. Without needing a woman to be his superior in every way. Otherwise we are just recreating the same issue with past female role models, where they are always subservient and meek. \n\nThere obviously are tons of positive role models in past media, but for the very reason you're arguing it's important that these characters are updated to illustrate the new male role model archetype. Otherwise their only positive role models are outdated characters like the misogynistic James Bond.",

It had to be done, and it will inevitably lead to a better outcome. \n\nWhen we talk about being hurt in a macro context, we are talking about a net gain or loss. If your definition of \"hurt\" and \"helped\" are totally removed from the net outcome, you'd say chemotherapy hurts people and heroin helps people. \n\nAmputating the leg that will kill you is literally done because of the net outcome of that action. \n\n>But you can't honestly tell me it didn't tarnish the very concept of masculinity.\n\nWhy would my or your concept of masculinity be tarnished because some gross piece of shit actor or musician we liked did bad things? There have been bad guys since there were guys.\n\n>If Lance Armstrong is my role model\n\nArmstrong was a great athlete. There's no shortage of great athletes today for kids to look up to. So if you found out one did drugs, why would that impact you so deeply as to shatter your idea of masculinity or turn you to evil? \n\n>Of those Marvel movies, I will give you Spiderman and maybe Shang Chi. But Thor and Dr. Strange were both movies where a female character was supplanting an established male character as the key protagonist.\n\nCome on, man. Are you a men's rights activist? Incel? Alien? \n\nI cannot fathom a person who's not sure that a movie about a father and son's relationship is about men. I can't believe you'd think that the fourth movie in a series about an ultra masculine male archetype is no longer about that guy because Natalie Portman shows up. And I refuse to wrap my brain around the fact that someone would claim that Dr. Strange wasn't about Dr. Strange because a young woman was also there for some of the movie. \n\nThis is some \"everything is woke\" nonsense. \n\n>It's just that the male characters in modern media are often in a position of apologizing for their maleness.\n\nIf you hate women, just say you hate women. I'm punching out. \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

In the development of metoo and metoo backlash, we might look to movies popular in the 80s--Risky Business, Indiana Jones, Top Gun, Flash Dance, Star Wars. Consider the treatment of women by characters played by Harrison Ford and Tom Cruise.  \nMany of the men who went on to harrass and assault women came of age when these movies were popular. Unfortunately the reaction to being called out was to double down.  \nMy feeling about kick but female leads is that it allows men and boys to engage in the same-old power fantasy but without the guilt of sexism.\n\nI'm not necessarily disagreeing with you. It does lead to the question of who we consider to be a good role models.",

Your further points seem to dive into various aspects of getting women or not abusing women. If you're being a \"good person\" because your dad told you you have to be good to get women, you're not being good: you're trying to pick up women. Women and men can both do well socioeconomically, but traditionally (and still) they're further behind in a lot of these things. Moving up when you're at the bottom is going to make a bigger difference faster. I think that accounts for at least some of what you're seeing.\n\nIf you want to blame something for the problems young men are having right now, social media and the rise of right wing influencers probably makes the most sense, but even that's going to be incomplete - it's a complex topic!\n\nAlso, there's plenty of great male (and female) role models for young men in media, you might have to look beyond the bubble of content fed towards young men on Tiktok, etc., but it exists. The Green brothers are a great example of this.",

            "body": "I'm actually going to make a very different argument about why men are doomed, because I don't think it has anything to do with a lack of good role models.\n\nI invite you to consider defining masculinity. It's actually fairly difficult - this is because masculinity as a cultural construction is fundamentally fluid. It is constituted and reconstituted daily through social interaction - we collectively negotiate what it means to be masculine as a society. This is why interpretations of masculinity vary and have varied so much across time and space - in America alone, idealized masculinity has moved between cowboys to GI Joe to James Bond and back.\n\nThis process by which masculinity is constructed is not a unitary process - different constructions of masculinity each vie for social acceptance. These competing masculinities are the reason why people have such a different idea of what it means to be manly. For the purposes of this discussion, we're gonna label the idea of masculinity that wins this contest - and in so doing gains widespread social acceptance - as hegemonic masculinity.\n\nTraditionally, hegemonic masculinity in a given society usually follows a certain pattern - it is typically an interpretation of masculinity which privileges masculine values over feminine ones, and privileges more masculine people over less masculine people. This is the reason that in a Western, American context, our cultural understanding of masculinity is associated with strength, aggression, competition and stoicism, whereas our understanding of femininity is associated with helplessness, compassion, cooperation and emotion. In truth these are all just human emotions and ways of being which have nothing to do with sex or gender, but they're coded masculine or feminine to sell a certain narrative about men and women. All other gendered tropes in our society occupy a similar paradigm.\n\nThis pattern is not a coincidence - masculinity as a social phenomenon exists for a purpose, and that purpose is fundamentally precedented on the maintenance of a certain paradigm of social power. Gender in general - and masculinity in particular - exists to justify, establish an perpetuate the domination of one half of the population over the other. This is why masculinity is so fucking fragile - a woman wearing a dress and combat boots can still be feminine, but a man wearing overalls and high heels is considerably less so, at least by the prevailing sentiment of social observers. Masculinity must be defined, restricted, rigid and enforced on both people coded as men and women, in order to maintain the underlying power dynamic which our understanding of gender serves to uphold.\n\nAll of this theory only serves as background for the actual argument in this post - background which, by the way, will seem fairly radical to some people who read this post but is actually overwhelming accepted in current social science as a discipline. Ultimately, the point is this -\u00a0**because masculinity is essentially constructed to uphold an unequal social paradigm, a society's prevailing understanding of masculinity will never and can never be healthy**. This is by overt design, because a healthy masculinity would not seek to oppress the other half of the population and would therefore fail to serve the very purpose of gendered identity. Without a wholesale transformation of our understanding of gender itself, there are can be no healthy examples of masculinities - the only ones who exist are merely people trying to resist hegemonic masculinity. While that may work for some very brave people on an individual level, it will never be able to alter the definition of hegemonic masculinity on a societal level without such reform because there are overwhelming external influences, driven by power interests, which seek to prevent it.\n\nAs an added note because this comes up in actual academic debates about this topic, but none of this should be construed as an attack on all men or masculine-coded people. Social constructions are the culmination of enormous factors and influence - just because you prefer one way of existing to another does not in of itself necessarily feed into these power paradigms. If you're the kind of guy who can be comfortable with a masculine gendered identity without conforming to our society's understanding of hegemonic masculinity, then you're very brave and more power to you. And even if you're not and you find yourself going along with shitty sexist jokes in your friend group so you don't seem like a pussy, you're kind of an immoral coward, but the point of this post is also that to some degree it also isn't entirely your fault - the game was sort of stacked against you from the start.",

They are all symbols of a fundamental version of masculinity that can branch out from there. \n\nLet's go more extreme here: What do qualities do hardened gangsters and criminals have in common with traditional male heroes?   \n\\- You might find that they seem relatively brave or at least without as much fear and they are tough. The unhealthy part comes from missing qualities like responsibility/accountability and missing healthy qualities like empathy. \n\nAnd I challenge the idea that masculinity at its core actually varies as much as you think it does. It is relatively similar across all cultures. And this has been the case since the dawn of humanity. Because if men didn't have these qualities, they couldn't protect themselves and those they care for. \n\nBio-psychologically speaking, men tend to have different levels of hormones that influence certain responses to certain situations. And there are biological reasons for this and it ties into our understanding of masculinity. I'm not saying you are suggesting this, but I think it is **absurd** to suggest that there is no truth to our traditional views of masculinity from a fundamental level. Sure, we can speak sociologically, but individually, there natural influences that have given certain qualities an advantage over others. This is observable in not just humans, but almost the entire animal kingdom. \n\nSo when we try to \"revamp\" our understanding of masculinity, we cannot try to lie to ourselves that men and women don't have fundamental differences in general and that we both have our own advantages and disadvantages. \n\nOf course there is a grey area because even biological systems vary and overlap. That is precisely why gender is considered a spectrum.",

You're ignoring a much simpler explanation - the traits you list as \"masculine\" are the traits needed for *soldiers*. The traits you listed as \"feminine\" are the traits needed to raise and nurture those soldiers.\n\nTurning this from bloodthirsty leaders requiring more cannon fodder for their conquests to a grand conspiracy by half the population to maintain their \"domination\"(like... dying in a war?) requires overlooking some pretty basic facts about history and demographics.",

The big thing about this stuff is how much it's socially punished. People will think you're crazy for actually divesting power. And this isn't just conservatives...left to right, this is something that just isn't done. \n\nWhere we're at I think, is where people have to pretend to reject hegemonic masculinity while at the same time performing it. And I think that's just very unhealthy and confusing. People don't know what the hell they're supposed to do with that. And a lot of people just are not capable of it. \n\nGetting people to apply these ideas to the people they care about is very difficult. It's not something we want. Getting men to reject this power, to give up our jobs, our relationships, our wealth, everything we have and are....it's just not something that's socially rewarded.

These individuals are incredibly wealthy, often coming from generations of inherited wealth and power. Anecdotally these individuals are usually not particularly masculine in the traditional sense. You don\u2019t see many hyper aggressive, physically strong, stoic political and economic elites. They\u2019re quite the opposite, usually very indirect, non-confrontational and eccentric. Even celebrities. Hollywood actors are literally theatre kids\u2026 come on. How the leading men of Hollywood have continued the charade of masculinity is a testament to their ability to play make believe for a living! \n\nThe success of the elites seems far more cerebral, are we saying mental strength is masculine? Women now increasingly occupy positions of power and wealth (granted not in such numbers but I don\u2019t accept the reason for that is solely \u201cmen bad, women oppressed\u201d, and it is slowly changing). They tend to adopt the same behaviors as those men who are in those positions. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the case that they do so because systems are controlled by men, but because success has been continuously linked to those behaviors, it just so happened for a long time women weren\u2019t able to express themselves in that manner, granted due to men. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, \u201cmen\u201d never really controlled society. Again, a tiny minority of individuals with immense economic and political power just so happened to be men. Unfortunately, it just so happened to be the case that when push came to shove men could hit women harder and did so for quite some time, which meant women could be physically excluded. But again, that hasn\u2019t been the case for quite some time and only a tiny minority of men held those positions. \n\nTo me it doesn\u2019t seem that the problem is anything inherent with \u201cmasculinity\u201d. It seems that the problem of disenfranchised men has always existed. It\u2019s just for virtually all our history the writers of our human story focused almost exclusively on the lives of the tiny minority of elites who just so happened to mainly be men. It seems intuitive that the overwhelming majority of every man who has ever lived has lived a quiet life of desperation. Born into hardship, unable to self actualize, forced either by circumstance or domination to act contrary to how they would want to act if not for their lot in life. There have always been Andrew Tates, people who have made money off selling ideas to those who wanted a hit of what it felt like to be the \u201cman\u201d, or \u201cwoman\u201d they felt they should be. \n\nThe \u201ccrisis of masculinity\u201d it seems isn\u2019t really a crisis in the sense that it is a particularly new phenomenon, but that social media and the connectivity provided by the internet have finally amplified the voices and experience of the socially irrelevant masses.\n\nEdited: for clarity",

The consequences extend beyond education\u2014men are experiencing declining workforce participation and increasing rates of mental health struggles, substance abuse, and even suicide (CDC, 2023). Meanwhile, traditional male virtues such as strength, discipline, and resilience are often dismissed or outright attacked in modern discourse, leaving young men without a clear path forward.\n\nA major factor contributing to this crisis is the absence of strong male role models. One in four children grows up without a father in the home (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020), and those who do often see their fathers sidelined or undermined. Without strong male guidance, young men turn to the internet, where they are bombarded by either feminist narratives that demonize masculinity or shallow, degenerate figures in the \"manosphere.\" Rather than being encouraged to embrace responsibility, competence, and leadership, men are increasingly told they are the problem. This vacuum of positive role models has led many to disengage from society, relationships, and personal ambition. Instead of dismissing their struggles, society must recognize the importance of strong masculine values\u2014honor, discipline, and self-sufficiency\u2014as the key to restoring direction and purpose for young men.",

Not just hard to see them as a role model, but just plain hard to see it, and then on top of that, it's not something that we as a society have chosen to value. \n\nI actually think the big problem is the mixed messages.....do we want men to succeed conventionally or not? You talk about Incels, but that doesn't start as misogyny. It starts as rejecting the idea of success. With the idea that society is supposed to change into something that values that.....but it never changed. Then you get the anger. \n\nTruth is, I think we just have to choose a direction. The current middle path and the mixed messages are not working.",

No one old enough to care is in need of a male role model that they didn't already have. I'm sorry, but this is a ridiculous view, and I couldn't care less if it's changed or not. However, for your own personal education I just wanted to let you know that there is no lack of high level male role models out there. You just aren't going to find any on tiktok or YT. You have to actually look for them, you have to actually take it upon yourself to do something to help yourself. They're not going to come find you, because you don't care enough to even look for them. \n \nSee, I think the actual problem is that kids born after 2008, as you stated, aren't doing anything useful to help anyone, not even themselves. Go out, get a job, work hard and I guarantee that you will quickly notice the good role models out there. But they don't dabble with babies, so maybe that's the problem.",

Thats biological programming from millenia of natural selection...\n\nI would expect that there will be a mass of women who either \"settle\" (i use that term very loosely) or a bunch of people will just not have kids at all. \n\nWomen have always preferred older established men.

There are more men alive today, throughout history, and fictionalized in media than ever before who can serve as role models to any aspiring young boy.\n\nInstead, the perceived loss is because we as a society have embraced postmodern perspectives. In postmodernism, there is a broad rejection of grand narratives and heroic figures. Narratives are built on assumptions, and those assumptions are saddled with baggage. Every ideology and every person is open to criticism and analysis. There are no saints, only humans.\n\nBroadly this is a good thing. I would rather live in a society where we are encouraged to scrutinize our leaders and be critical of media representations.\n\nThis postmodernisn taken to the extreme -- a sort of apathetic nihilism -- should be avoided, however. That can have a stagnating effect on its followers.\n\nA loss of \"male role models\" is a very surface level understanding of the issue. The phenomenon is better understood as a loss of shared stories and no longer seeing individuals as heroic figures. Instead, I believe the world is best understood in terms of competing narratives, and \"role models\" are best understood as sometimes flawed individuals who have achieved some modicum of social clout.\n\n*Thomas Jefferson was a founding father, but he was also a slaveholder.* That's a profound irony that every democracy-enjoyer has to sit with, really sit with.\n\nAs far as my personal perspective, kids who hero-worship grow up into hero-worshipping adults. We don't need more of those. We have enough. Instead, we need more critical thinkers and people willing to challenge the status quo, because the status quo is unsustainable.",

So many young men are being groomed into believing that being aggressive, abusive towards women, to look down on people is how men should act. How money is the key to success. How simple pleasures and happiness must be put away in order to achieve manliness. \n\nThey are taught that Christianity demands a strong patriarchy and they any violation must be violently snuffed out. \n\nAnd for some people, this isn\u2019t a grift.

It isn't that those weren't problems back then, but it wasn't *identified* as a societal problem yet. People blamed alcohol, working, stress, for men being destructive to women. The temperance movement could potentially be described as a big turning point in the role model discussion, as women of the time sought to remove the temptations of alcohol and to raise the next generation as their idea of proper men. This obviously worked to a degree, but I believe that it may have been a treatment for symptoms to an illness we're still trying to identify.

Over the long term, things are objectively better now than they were in the past for humanity writ large.  Furthermore things tend toward the better at a rate that would have been unimaginable 100, 500, 1000 years ago.  There is a ton of research on this, as well as research on the negativity and recency biased that are genetically built into the human brain that makes it hard for us to see or acknowledge this. Here are a few books summarizeing the raft of research and history proving the argument for human progress over the long term and use history to illustrate it:\n\n1. \"The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined\" by Steven Pinker examines the long-term decline of violence throughout history, showing how, despite the many conflicts we face, human society has become significantly less violent over the centuries, thanks to reason, governance, and moral progress.\n\n2. \"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress\" by Steven Pinker argues that the values of the Enlightenment\u2014reason, science, humanism, and progress\u2014have led to remarkable advancements in human well-being. He uses data to show how global life expectancy, health, wealth, education, and safety have improved over time. Pinker defends optimism, emphasizing that despite challenges, humanity's long-term trajectory is overwhelmingly positive due to these guiding principles.\n\n3. \"The Rational Optimist\" by Matt Ridley advocates for rational optimism, arguing that human progress has been driven by trade, innovation, and cooperation. He examines history to show how the exchange of ideas and goods has improved living standards and spurred innovation. Ridley contends that despite modern challenges, the power of human ingenuity and collaboration suggests a promising future.\n\n4. \"Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World\u2014and Why Things Are Better Than You Think\" by Hans Rosling uses data to challenge common misconceptions about the state of the world, arguing that, overall, global conditions such as health, wealth, and education have greatly improved.\n\n5. \"Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future\" by Johan Norberg argues that humanity has made significant strides in health, wealth, freedom, and education. Using history and data, he makes the case that we are living in the best time in human history.",

                    "body": "Now I want to take some of your arguments point by point.\n\n>Young men in America are in a crisis. Study after study shows this. Women are leaving men behind when it comes to education, social mobility, and just about every metric aside from incarceration and a propensity to commit violent crime. \n\nWomen are surpassing men on a lot of positive metrics, but that doesn't mean men aren't also making progress consistent with the long term historical trend in human progress. Violence does nothing but go down over the long term.  Crime in general has done nothing but gone down over the long term. If one runner passes another, it doesn't mean that the runner who was passed is moving backwards.  There has been a tremendous and relatively recent (like past 10 years) investment in supporting women's rate of progress.  They are surpassing men in some positive metrics because that investment is paying off.  I see absolutely no reason why when society observes mens rate of progress isn't improving fast enough why those investments won't be adjusted toward catching men up with the women.  We figured out how to do it, we can apply the strategies readily now.\n\n\n>I believe the reason for this is that any young men born after 2008 have had shockingly few positive male role models to look up to and grow up with. Many young men don't have fathers active in their life. This part isn't new, and it sets them on a path with negative outcomes to begin with. These men will inevitably look to people in their lives such as teachers, coaches, or other family members/family friends. If young men don't have these positive male role models in their lives, they look to public figures.\n\nIt took about 300,000 years from the earliest homo sapiens to 1950 to reach a world population of 3 Billion people.  It has taken 75 years to go from 3 Billion to 8.16 Billion people.  Half of these people are men, and as the 5 book references summarizing all research im human progress prove, these 8.16 Billion people are better as a whole along every positive metric (Humanism, Enlightenment, Nonviolence, etc).  So there are a pool of 4.08 Billion men today that are on average better than in the past, much smaller population of men.  That's an ample population from which to extract plenty of role models.\n\nRegarding public figures, watch how men were portrayed in movies from the dawn of film up through now. Many positive role models from the past were are gross by today's standards.  Expand that to include even fictional men depicted in stories, same trend applies.  There is a much higher standard for \"acceptable behavior\" today than even 30 years ago, and unacceptable behavior is punished socially and legally at a higher rate.\n\n\n\n> Many young men do have fathers. Many of their fathers are heroes to them that they look up to. \n\nFor the past several hundred years the role of fatherhood has done nothing but expand and become more sophisticated, more involved, and more emotionally intelligent, while preserving masculine identity.\n\n> Many of these young men have witnessed their fathers abandon every principle they ever held in obsequence to the worst human America has ever elected as president. Whatever characteristics their fathers might teach their children, they also are teaching them that cruelty, criminality, and poor treatment of women and minorities is acceptable. Even most fathers who don't agree with those principles, who even tell their children to not be those things, are teaching them that very thing through their continued support of those actions. We used to tell kids that actions speak louder than words. They do. Even if a young man today has a positive role model in their personal life, whether it be a father, a father figure, a coach, a teacher, whatever it may be, as soon as they are old enough to consume their own media they are pushed by social media algorithms to listen/watch some of the worst humans available. Deadbeat Dads, avowed misogynists, accused rapists, domestic abusers, and more of the worst men that America has to offer are beamed directly into their brains as a model of a modern man. \n\nI think you vastly overestimate the importance of politicians in general, let alone their importance to children.  I get it, you are very upset that the president kind of sucks, and might even be fixated on this.  Not everything is about our politicians.  Politicians are famously awful, and always have been.  Our politicians are weaker than any prior kings, conquerers, raiders, or warlords... Yet as established by the 5 book references humanity has made tremendous progress in spite of past leaders having tremendously more power and influence.  It would be incredible if this trend did not hold for far weaker leaders among a global pool of 8.16 billion people to compare them against.\n\n> Honor, empathy, integrity, kindness, strength of character, these are all things that make a man a good person. These are things that are found almost nowhere among the current \"manosphere\" or in our public life. This is what is creating what many of these men who now call themselves, incels. Incel's are raised, not born. They're being taught by this manosphere that it is not their fault, but that of women, that they are ignored. These people never had a father figure in their life who told them, \"stop being a horrible person and maybe then women will like you,\" and they desperately need to. I know this is not all young American men, and I applaud those who have had to raise themselves to be responsible adults despite all the adults telling them to be horrible to others, but it is a majority of young men, who will raise another generation of young men. Please change my view, and I'd especially be interested in hearing from those young men who have made it to adulthood while casting off the forces of society attempting to turn them against their fellow citizens.\n\nThe manosphere is a very recent movement that as far as movements go, is miniscule relative to the population of people in the world.  It is miniscule relative to the number of people who have even heard that it exists.  It is still miniscule relative to the number of people who could name a \"role model\" within it.  Possibility due to your Internet filter bubble or due to your expressed interest/passion on this topic, you may be unusually aware of it and vastly overestimating it's influence.",

The absence of support is important, but I think it's insulting to all men to assume that adult men aren't providing anything to most communities. \n\nThere are teachers, coaches, family members, older siblings/cousins, etc. They all are actively helping young men around them.\n\n>Women are leaving men behind when it comes to education, social mobility, and just about every metric aside from incarceration and a propensity to commit violent crime.\n\nThis is a systemic issue and something that needs to be addressed in a multi-faceted approach. Improving education, funding programs during and after school, hiring more male teachers will help. \n\nCost of living, cost of college, and the general anxiety young people are feeling overall contributes to a lot of stress for young men and loss of hope. \n\nWe've seen this in prior generations of men too. It isn't as if men in the 90s or 00s were all doing well. The trend has to start somewhere. \n\nYoung people overall have lost community, the same way all of us have. This harms young men's ability to find connections, romantic partners, and feel fulfilled day-to-day.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9811250/\n\nWith the advance of technology and social media, there is less incentive to actually be in person and build strong connections. This harm socialization skills and overall happiness. On top of this, the common point about a loss of the \"Third Space\", the place that isn't home or school/work has been popularized online. \n\nWhile this is important, we've also seen an overall drop in community involvement from the 70s on. People are less engaged in groups that once were hubs of socialization. This isn't just a Third Space thing. You cannot just build these places and people will come. You need to change the culture in our society. \n\nWe've become a lot of more isolated, individualistic, and judgmental of each other. This is separate from people who are actively hateful. I just mean that people tend to assume others will think the worse of their actions. \n\nWe haven't even gotten into social media and the impact of kids. They see a reality that is entirely fictional. You can go on this sub and see people argue things as if their Discord or Reddit feed is what EVERYONE is thinking. This isn't just a young person's issue either.\n\n>Even if a young man today has a positive role model in their personal life, whether it be a father, a father figure, a coach, a teacher, whatever it may be, as soon as they are old enough to consume their own media they are pushed by social media algorithms to listen/watch some of the worst humans available.\n\nSo I don't get this because you say even if role models exist the problem is social media. So why is your CMV about role models?  \n\n>These people never had a father figure in their life who told them, \"stop being a horrible person and maybe then women will like you,\" and they desperately need to.\n\nA lot of young men who fall into incel or manosphere stuff aren't alone entirely. They may have loving parents, but they have been sucked into these subcultures online because they have a lot of time on their phones or computers. These people speak to them directly and even if their solutions are bad, they offer something these young men agree with because it's easier than doing the hard work to improve/grow. Especially when you are young and still finding yourself. \n\nWithout knowing these men, or a specific studies (more than one to show a clear pattern), we should not assume all these young men are just going to this content because they don't have anything else. \n\nWhen you are a teenager or 20 year old kid you really do see the world differently and you may not want to connect with the men in your life, but rather the cool influencer you see online. You may not want to talk to your parents or see the men in your life as respectable. \n\nI think a lot of people in general don't get their parents when they're young. They don't see them as people or the perspective of being a parent/adult.\n\nTeens and young men have always been tempted by poor role models because they're cool. They're probably counter-culture and they resonate with these men. Idk if a role model will fix this desire if these people are actively too online or isolated or have no hope.",

The problem is that, without a father to give individual attention and guidance, young men are now relying on general advice from strangers, and there's money to be made in peddling advice that sells regardless of how correct it is.\n\nBut, without a father invested in them, how do young men tease out what is good and bad?

You can argue about the reasons for this if you like. \n\nAnd that's just referring to the husbands in couples that didn't divorce or have children out of wedlock. \n\nI know there are exceptions.

This is both because 1) there are plenty of men that act as positive role models for young men that have a more liberal worldview (e.g. Bernie Sanders, Keanu Reeves, Kendrick Lamar, etc.) and 2) young men have a more open view of gender norms and roles and don't really have the same *need* for a heavily gendered role model that conservative men seem to need.  When you aren't as hung up on traditional gender roles, you don't need a role model that embodies masculinity or even a male role model at all - you just need someone that inspires you to be a better person, e.g. someone that is good at what they do and has a positive impact on the world.",

To have meaning means beating back the people like Musk who think we are too lazy and have it too good right now and need to be working 7 days a week. We need the ability and economic stability to develop our own meaning and create organic community connections.

Not saying there's anything wrong with that, but it's tough to really evaluate a person when they're always playing a character that is written by someone else. Musicians?
