Turkiye plays their own game, but they are honest in it.\nWhile Americans say that they will stand with us as long as it takes but stabbing us in the back at the same time. Turkiye never hid their plans to do business with russians, but at the same time they are investing in our defence and opening drone manufactures in Ukraine",

The American colonies completely broke away from British rule, but Turkey was basically built from what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Atat\u00fcrk and the nationalists definitely wanted to leave the Ottoman past behind, but in reality, they still relied on a lot of Ottoman institutions, especially the military, government administration, and legal system, until they could fully replace them. \n\nNutuk makes it clear that Atat\u00fcrk and his movement had no love for the Ottoman system, yeah, but it also shows that change didn\u2019t happen instantly. The reason things were reformed gradually wasn\u2019t just strategy, it\u2019s also because there just weren\u2019t enough trained people to immediately replace all the Ottoman-era officials. You can\u2019t just wipe the slate clean overnight, as you rightly bring up\n\nSo yeah, Turkey was a fresh start in terms of ideology, but in practice, a lot of early Turkey still ran on Ottoman foundations while the new systems were being built and gradually replaced.\n\nAnd interestingly, modern Turkey under Erdo\u011fan has been embracing more of its Ottoman roots again. He has openly said that Turkey is a \"continuation\" of the Ottoman Empire and frequently refers to Turkish citizens as \"grandchildren of the Ottomans.\" His government has revived Ottoman-era symbols, like the use of the term \"k\u00fclliye\" for university campuses and even considered bringing back the tughra as an official emblem.\n\nForeign policy under Erdo\u011fan also leans into a neo-Ottoman vision, trying to increase Turkey\u2019s influence in the Middle East and former Ottoman lands. So while Atat\u00fcrk distanced Turkey from its Ottoman past, the current leadership is actively reconnecting with it in some ways.",

Turkey has held the opposite interest of NATO at every possible turn for ages, whether in reality or performatively, to try and leverage a deal to gain their cooperation. \n\nCan you imagine giving up the f35 for the sake of s400 systems?? Along with risking all of the f35's stealth advantages against a country we thought was more than just a paper tiger? Their goal with this negotiation was to get a full tech transfer of the patriot system to be able to build their own versions. Being basically given them wasn't good enough. I mean, at the time we thought s400 was top notch, and it was also at a moment where the patriot was continuing to get more and more and more of a bad rap, but Ukraine has seemed to show the patriot system to be fantastically reliable, even in an \"offensive\" capability. And Russia has had just a horrid air defense showing across the entire campaign. But yeah, with the s400 fiasco we finally said \"fine, we are gonna budge, do it your way,\" and they held to their threat. I still wonder if they were too prideful to back down with their tails between their legs or if they really thought that was a good deal.",

I doubt they really want to go through any of that again. They have been very consistent with their statements regarding UA borders - and yes - they have a far better relationship with UA than russia - not to mention Crimean Tatars.\n\nAnd on top of all of that, they have their own sphere of influence that they are building - mostly with former USSR states. So. Nope. I do not see them flipflopping on this. Turkey knows what is in Turkey's best interests - which is much more than I can say for the US.",

Contrary instead of Kurdish separatists using it as argument for independence, Turkey can use it to take Mosul and Kerkuk which were originally Turkish cities but UK didn't allow Turkey to get them back. By doing so Turkey can claim Kurds and Turks will live together and merge with Kurdish regions. Turkey already have good relations with Iraq Kurds and they just started required steps to make peace with PKK. PKK's founding leader asked from PKK to drop their weapons and protect Kurdish right as politicians. So no, I don't think that's their reasoning. People forget that Russia is the nemesis of the Turks. While Armenia and Greece sees Turkey as biggest threat. To Turkey they are not big enough to see it as threat.",

Since diplomatic efforts failed and negotiations with the UK and Greece did not lead to a solution, Turkey cited Article IV of the Treaty of Guarantee and launched Operation Attila on July 20, 1974.\n\nAlso again, in 2004 with Annan plan Turks wanted to unite again, Greek Cypriots refused.
