But, he always has a correctly aligned inner compass when it comes to naming the RusZian aggression and its political supporters in Germany, the AFD. Such \u201canti-patriots\u201d must never be allowed to assume political responsibility in Germany. That would be like Trump ruling Germany. Trump is selling out everyone, including the US(S)A to RuZZland, just so he can buy a mine or open a hotel somewhere.\n\nThat's why.... support the upcoming German government and the necessary rearmament. Also an even stronger support for Ukraine and finally TAURUS.\n\nSlava!",
