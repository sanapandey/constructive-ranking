Offended by everything, ashamed of nothing.\n\nThey just don't get it, and they refuse to get it.\n\nTheir centuries-old self-entitlement and fanaticism over their exceptionalism make jihadists of ISIS or the Taliban look reasonable.\n\nHow are the Russians going to escalate at this point?\n\nAbduct more Ukrainian kids? Do an extra double-tap strike on a Ukrainian open-air market?\n\nEveryone knows that they won't launch a nuke on Ukraine since their true masters in Peking will cut them off.",

Watching what they did in the office to war hero like Zelensky made me physically sick. I could only wish our leader was a 100th of the man Zelensky is. That is the kind of leader you fight and die proudly for.",

The Russian public have been fed the \" great victory in Kursk\" line once to often and now want the army to go all the way to Polish border or even Berlin so the Ultranationalists have for once popular support in the population.\n\nIf he refuses the cease fire Trump will be pissed and just might force him to the table by providing Ukraine with more equipment and take any restrictions off the use of weapons, Putin is trying to spin things out in the hope his army can win decisively in Ukraine (not likely) or that Trump somehow pressures Ukraine into complete capitulation  (not likely).
