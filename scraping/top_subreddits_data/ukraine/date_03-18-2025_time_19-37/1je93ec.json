While I would love for Ukraine to do this, unfortunately this is not the reality of the war right now.  I keep having hope that the tides are changing when Ukraine has Russia held up and recaptures some land, then Ukraine will do a retreat and give up land somewhere else.  \n\nWhile it does appear Russia is starting to exhaust its supply of heavy machinery and long range missiles, they do not, at the moment, seem to be out of troops.  Russia just keeps on sending wave after wave after wave of troops and taking land from Ukraine.  \n\nSo, if Ukraine does not want to give up its land then something drastic needs to change.  First, they have to talk Europe into giving a lot more than they have, both in equipment and money.  Assuming Ukraine is successful in that then they will need a few dominos to fall their way.  They need to either develop or get Europe to give them longer range missiles/ICBM\u2019s and a lot of them.  Ukraine needs to be able to hit the airfields of Russia\u2019s bombers, to push them a lot further from the front lines. Secondly, they need more boots on the ground and the need the west to equip those soldiers.  From what it looks like they have approximately 800k soldiers, they need to get that to 1 - 1.2 million to match Russia.  Currently Zelenskyy appears unlikely to do this.  Lastly, they need to take a more scorched earth approach to Russia.  Meaning Ukraine needs to ramp up its attacks in Russia several fold.  They need to decimate Russia\u2019s ability to fund the war.  Absolutely flatten every single refinery, port, pipeline, and tanker they can find.  Make it impossible for Putin to keep going.  The last one will hurt India, China, and Europe and none of them will be too happy about it. \n\nIf you look across the last several decades at the wars that were fought and \u201cwon\u201d and the ones that were fought and stalemated, the country or population that was willing to do whatever it took to win is almost always the one that came out on top eventually.  So either Zelenskyy needs to secure the funding and take the war to a place not even Putin will go or he needs to make the best deal he can and get the war over with.  But slowly retreating like Ukraine has done since the first counter attack is not going to put Ukraine in any better position in the next year or years.  Zelenskyy has to change something in this war or make a deal.",
