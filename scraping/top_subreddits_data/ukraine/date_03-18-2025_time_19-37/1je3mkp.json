It is about what can be expected and thus to what level of annihilation of the enemy is necessary. Throughout history, the default condition is either victory or death. There is evidence that at one point, [more than 80% of _all_ men died in a war somewhere between 7,000-5,000 BC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04375-6). How many of these men died because the victor granted no quarter? How many of these men died because their adversaries chose not to surrender?\n\nTo be honest, the more I have thought about the concept of the laws of war and warcrimes, the more I come to believe that the purpose is not to prevent all such illegal acts, but rather to control them and explicitly define stages of escalation and personal consequence. As with much of the way of the world, there is a difference between legal/illegal and just/unjust. I'm of the mind that there are differing categories of warcrimes, for which punishment ranges between hard labor of rebuilding, life imprisonment, execution, or worse. For some crimes warranting execution, I wouldn't even say that it's strictly Immoral or objectively Wrong of the person, but that it is a trade that they are making (\"Jolly good ol' sport. Well played. Well, off to the gallows.\"). And yes, there are fates worse than death and there are crimes in war that warrant them. \n\nThe main thing about calling them Crimes is that there's really no other concept within our cultural structure to describe a set of rules agreed to by society of action and consequence, purchase and payment, harm and punishment. The issue with doing so is that, for those living in just societies, our minds default to thinking of the concepts of legal and just, and illegal and unjust as synonyms, which is not true. In almost all cases they _should_ be, but that is not by _necessity_ true.\n\nIf you are genuinely interested in understanding better, I highly recommend you read _Vom Krieg_, _On War_, von Clausewitz's treatise on the nature and theory of modern war. While it does not touch on the subject of war crimes per se, it does build a basic concept for the Why and How of strategic warfare (The philosophical Why for fighting an invader is a given), which in turn should help you understand how the concept of the Laws of War facilitate those goals.",

Not wearing enemy uniform is a basic \"rule\" of warfare because if you cannot trust your uniforms then you need to have a level of inter-service distrust that will regularly lead to friendly fire. As such, basically everyone agreed not to do it so you don't have to constantly shoot your own soldiers for acting a bit sus. Same for fighting out of uniform - if people don't agree to it you have to start killing every civilian you see, just in case. Same with not using hospitals as bases or fighting positions, it's better all around if we (well, besides Russia) just don't bomb and/or carefully inspect every hospital in the area. Everyone, mostly, agrees to these rules because if they act against them then it's fair game to have the same done back and everything becomes much more scorched earth than anyone wants.   \n  \nOn the other hand, \"Don't tell the person you're fucking where your troops are\" is a fairly easy rule to follow. You don't need to execute your partner post-sex so long as you don't inadvertently call out grid locations of your units while climaxing.",

I guess the difference between that and some other tactics is that they are often used more defensively than as an attack. For example, getting the Germans to bomb paper tanks instead of real ones, or leaving a corpse on a beach with fake attack plans to trick the Germans into defending elsewhere (meaning fewer people are likely to get hurt).. I guess some of the more modern dirty tactics haven\u2019t been added to the list just yet, because a lot of them come out of technological advancements which we\u2019re kind of just figuring out as we go",
