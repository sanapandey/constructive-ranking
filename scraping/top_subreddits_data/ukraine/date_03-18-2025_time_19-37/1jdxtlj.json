    "selftext": "I was in the city the other night and saw the flag instillation for Ukraine draped around the famous NYC cube. Within seconds of passing it a guy rode up aggressively and ripped down the flag and then shoved it in the trash. After he left, I pulled it out of the garbage and tried to clean it off to put it back up. However it was difficult to place it on top again so we wrapped it around the base with the help of some others. Hoping it gets put back up soon!",

I know the sentiment is that they have this pent up desire to destroy Russia, but this isn't shown in the voting data.\n\nIt makes no sense to me, why do the fighting in 5-10 years on Polish soil after the Russians have re-grouped and now have access to Ukrainian cannon fodder when you could instead fight now on Ukrainian soil alongside the Ukrainians.\n\nThis thinking can certainly be applied to other European countries as well. But it's most relevant to Poland because if Ukraine falls, Russia will have a large border with Poland, and all you hear online is that the Poles can't wait to get involved with destroying the Russians.",

If as you say only supporters are in this thread then it seems to have become quite hostile toward us.  Why alienate a genuine supporter?  \n\nI felt defensive, and the statement I responded to is not accurate at all, at least where I live I see a great deal support.  You are way off base, as usual.",

We can start by fighting political corruption, providing proper social services, ending presidential and police immunity, and shutting down all the fascist propaganda that's making people dangerously insane.  ...oh, whoops...we just elected a guy whose entire goal is to make those things even worse, and he's succeeding.   \n\nSo now, we just have to accept that we have to fight a dangerous fight.  There's no way to avoid it.  In fact, we're now at a point where not fighting (and the end result of that) is even more dangerous than fighting.  So next time somebody pulls a Ukrainian flag down, I hope they get jumped. \n\nLook at what Ukrainians did to save their country in 2014.
