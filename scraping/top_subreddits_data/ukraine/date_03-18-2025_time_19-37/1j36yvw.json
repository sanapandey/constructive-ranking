    "selftext": "As a Ukrainian and one of the founders of this community, I must address you all today, for the global situation has taken a grim turn in the past few days and it will not get better without our actions.\n\nThe agenda of the new White House administration is now undeniably clear \u2014 **russia must win this war and restore its position in Europe**. Though unfathomable when such goal initially became public, this reality is now staring us all in the face. We can argue long and hard why they want this but that will only make us lose precious time and initiative. The next steps have already been outlined so we know what is coming:\n\n- cut all aid to Ukraine\n- remove sanctions from russia\n- supply rusia with weaponry (either secretly or openly, depending on how brazen they get).\n\nSo, what can we do?\n\n1. To Americans:\n\nGet a gun and learn to shoot. As someone who has participated in two revolutions, I can tell you that our situation back then wasn\u2019t as dire as yours is now. Unfortunately, I see no way forward for you without civil disobedience and violent resistance. You can continue to write letters and call your representatives but in my view those efforts are now as useful as writing to Putin. This is not even two months of this Presidency - imagine what will happen in two years.\n\n2. To my European friends:\n\nI can tell you what will happen in two years. More specifically I can give two options:\n\n- either we unite and push russia back now in its weakened state\n- or you will face a resurgent russia several years later, armed to the teeth, with a replenished stockpile of ammunition and using the rest of the Ukrainian population as they are doing with their national minorities now - driving them in meat waves to discover artillery positions and clear minefields.\n\nAttend rallies, contact your representatives, organize meetups with other activists to raise noise and to demand to massively increase military aid including boots on the ground. Your politicians will be pressured by the Americans to stop the aid and remove sanctions from russia - you must pressure them back and make your voices heard.\n\nThere is no diplomatic solution to this for both Putin and Trump see themselves as the architects of a new world order and the rest of us must either submit or perish. They are both in the final years of their lives and they will act swiftly. Imagine how many lives could have been saved if Europe stopped Hitler at Czechoslovakia and Sudetenland, we are in the same part of history again. \n\n3. To Ukrainians:\n\nIt\u2019s time for us to fully switch to a war economy. Donate, enlist, and think of every possible way to ensure our existence. Many of you know much better than me what to do but we must be even more serious about it. Either we stop russia now or be forced to fight Europe later.\n\nThe good guys still outnumber the bad ones, but the bad ones are willing to act with ruthless speed and force others to do their bidding. We must act preemptively, and we must act now.",

Anything you can. Stay educated and don\u2019t get caught up on defeatism and distractions. \n\nYou got the wake up call.",

National security, lack of workers (because deported) and the resulting damage to your economy, inflation, etc. pp. you know the facts better yourself. If \"only\" Democrats protest, your government can always say: we don't care, they lost anyway and we know they don't agree with our policies. Stand together with the reasonable conservatives!

Don't give up, democracy needs you!!\n\nand PS: I saw a few people in protests wearing kuffiyas.. this is not about palestine, this is about the US democracy.

They could put thousands of people in the streets no problem. Even that didn't stop the war. What stopped the war was 60,000 Americans coming back in body bags and the armed resistance of the Vietnamese. I regret to say it, but it  but the peaceful protests aren't gonna do shit.

It's a little eerie, because in the past every news agency was fighting each other for coverage if so much as 30 or 40 people showed up to protest something, and most of the ones these last few weeks have had one or two reporters, sometimes none.\n\nAnd my area is not exceptional, we're pretty average. Granted, no violent or intense standoffs yet, these are more like rallies than anything but many of them are still in the thousands or tens of thousands of people even in areas with small populations.\n\nAnd conservatives / Trump voters are getting in on it, too, though in a different way. Check this series of clips from last week's community meetings. (Congress was 'home' last week, and community meetings are a pretty normal part of being \"at home\"; keep in mind that Seattle, WA to Miami, FL is the same distance as London to Baghdad, Iraq. Congress doesn't just get on a train and go DC/home every day, they do a few days or weeks (or months) in DC and then have a recess period where they are in their offices in their districts taking meetings and office hours.\n\nFrom my city to DC is the same distance as Dublin, Ireland to Kyiv. And I'm only halfway across the country. When Congress is home, meetings are usually pretty generic meet-and-greets, but this last week was decidedly *not* generic. These are all from districts that went very strongly for Trump, with most of the public present being Trump supporters (most introduced themselves, but that was edited out for brevity in this sequence). They were *merciless* taking their MAGA reps to the cleaners: [https://youtu.be/j7lXWNWzmtc?si=MtgnXfouAx0Uu1yy](https://youtu.be/j7lXWNWzmtc?si=MtgnXfouAx0Uu1yy)",

I don't think that is making international news, and it's reported so haphazardly in the US that it feels like less than it is. Nearly every action except tariffs and the ceremonial \"name change\" type stuff is reversed or frozen and being duked out in court. But you wouldn't know that by the latest headline quoting Trump's most recent executive order or social media post.\n\n[Litigation Tracker: Legal Challenges to Trump Administration Actions](https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/)\n\nAs of writing this comment there is at least one lawsuit with Ukrainians in the US as complainants in regards to Trump's threat to withdraw their protected status; and at least three other similar suits without Ukrainians but on the same question. None are yet resolved this term, but most of these suits in his first term succeeded in denying the administration the ability to revoke protected status (meaning people could remain in the US).\n\nThat's not to say we couldn't be doing more visible actions, our messaging right now is shit; but if it helps my current read on the situation is that the BIG protest pushes are waiting for something that isn't going to end up in court before you even get your crowd assembled.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the BIG actions are responding to immigration sweeps and protesting *inside* state capitols to smack down the hundreds of bullshit bills Trump's party is trying to pass at the state level. \n\n* On immigration, the agency's stated goal has been 1,500 arrests per day, and thanks to insane organizing and real-time legal interventions they are rarely taking more than 100 per day and often less. This is only making occasional news in the US and I would be surprised if it is breaking through internationally; but make no mistake this is a *massive* undertaking considering the continental US is larger than continental Europe and that every sweep is either unannounced or is known only minutes to hours in advance.\n* In state houses, keep in mind that each state is *almost* its own country in most regards; that's a separate discussion but what it means is that each state can create and enforce its own laws as long as the laws are not involving international relations or immigration. And Trump's party has been bringing bills almost daily in most states, most of the bills are examples/models they want to \"test run\" and eventually introduce in Congress. And they have been failing, miserably, because people show up in hundreds or thousands while the bills are still in committee before even going out for a full vote with the legislature.\n   * Some bills are getting through, obviously, but a stunning number are failing, and often dramatically when the public show up and use public comment to outline all the ways this or that bill would open up the state to lawsuits or that the proposed law could be evaded, that enforcement would require the violation of multiple civil rights, and so on. The bill I sat in on two weeks ago had five *hours* of public comment offered, with each person limited to two or three minutes. No breaks. And hundreds more sat in but did not offer comment except to indicate their level of support for whoever happened to be speaking at each moment.\n* Congress was \"in district\" last week meaning they were at home, and most held community meetings. And a funny thing happened. The larger the vote for Trump in a given district, the more forcefully Republican voters showed up to harass their representatives for letting Trump and Musk have free reign without Congressional pushback. Here is a two minute collection of clips from some of the meetings, but this was happening all over the country last week. It was a pretty wild ride, so much so that the Republican party advised their members to cancel remaining meetings and do them virtually instead: [https://youtu.be/j7lXWNWzmtc?si=MtgnXfouAx0Uu1yy](https://youtu.be/j7lXWNWzmtc?si=MtgnXfouAx0Uu1yy)\n\nThe time for force will come, I have no doubt -- but just because we aren't laying in the streets right now doesn't mean we are sitting around picking our noses.",

One of their honeypots was openly making the rounds in the NRA under Trump 1.0. The head of the NRA was ousted, they've been taken to court for fraud, their donations are down to unsustainably low levels (which further raises the spectre of literal russian money being put into the org)...bunch of shit over the last ten years.\n\nThe 2A crowd is pretty brazen about telling you they are all about guns, but my experience is that all segments of the populace are roughly equally armed (except for the superfan types, but those are a wild outlier). At the large scale, gun ownership is pretty even across all groups. Just that most of us have no reason to talk about it or brandish the guns in public. They're tools for most, not a fetish.

We will be fine - the worst won't happen here\". I am afraid that is the mindset of most Americans right now - they are certain \"it\" can't happen here, that our democracy is over 200 years old, that our checks and balances will hold, that Trump isn't as bad as some say, that the midterm elections will save us.\n\nIt IS happening here, he IS as bad as those of us are saying and I am scared to death it is already too late. With the richest man in the world pushing us into autocracy and most billionaires behind him, along with a majority in our Congress and the Cabinet, it IS happening faster than any of us could have believed. Although a few Republicans are starting to have doubts, it is too little and too late - they are Hindenburg and von Papen who thought they could use and control Hitler for their own gains and just like they did, are finding out that they cannot control Trump and the puppet masters like Putin and Musk behind him. \n\nWe are circling the drain here in the US. For all that is still good in this world, all of Europe and Canada MUST stand united for Ukraine and against Russia, and sadly, the US.",

We all know Trump and Putin aren\u2019t going to budge so what is the point of further negotiations?  \n\nIs he going to hand over the mineral rights in exchange for continued support?

They\u2019re the second largest economy in the world, they can afford to support Ukraine and tell the US to screw off.  Ukrainians are dying to protect Europe, the least they can do is give them as much support as possible. \n\nAll that \u201cwe\u2019ll never do appeasement to fascists again!\u201d talk was BS.

However, I simply do not think that Drumpf and co. could transform the usa into a dictatorship as easily as Hitler could. Hitler was able to do this in 1933 Germany by way of the enabling act.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933\n\nThis was a law that was a law passed by the Weimar Reichstag. It gave Hitler and his cabinet legal power to rule autocratically. The big cheeto and his DOGE yes-men could not do this. Congress is basically 50-50 now in the US, and so no one is voting him any sort of dictatorial power anything soon.\n\nNow, I don't know agree that 2025 is a sort of attempted coup. They are doing damage, and who's to say who in the military and police would or would jot side with Trump when push comes to shove. But legal power? He still can't obtain that. Dictators need this. For example, Erdogan altered Turkey's constitution when he took power. Now he can't be kicked out. Same can be said for Orb\u00e1n. I don't know about the head of Ruzzia, but I'm\ngonna take a bet that he probably got legal power somehow.\n\nNow, while Trump has evaded the law regarding his own person, he is yet to change the law to suite the power grab he desperately wants. The US Constitution is still strong enough to prevent him. Trump can't do what Hitler, or any of them, have done. \n\nThis is an article from Vox that backs up my reasoning. I learned a lot of this argument from them and I think that they make a good point. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/s/FFd840CQoD",

OP as you say you're not an American.  I am...... family has been here since Mayflower came ashore. You're calling for a bunch more guns in although folks here often have toddler level fear and impulse control issues.  They don't have military training. They should NOT have weapons.  But the more guns we buy here, the more Russia loves how we are destabilizing ourselves! \n\nIn the military, you learn discipline before you are issued a weapon. Here, in the USA, you get scared, buy a weapon, and usually *never* get training in discipline. So the last thing we need is folks from other countries - like the OP - urging us to make things even *more* dangerous in our country.  This is what the Russian FSB has been trying to do and the Soviet KGB tried to do before that.  They thank you for contributing to their efforts\n\n(EDITED FOR CLARITY)",
