In 2017, as a result of his reporting, he was kidnapped by Russian-backed militants and held captive for nearly three years, enduring torture.  \n  \nIn this post, we share Stanislav Aseyev\u2019s perspective on what Radio Liberty means for those fighting for democracy \u2014 and what its shutdown signifies for those who oppose it.",
