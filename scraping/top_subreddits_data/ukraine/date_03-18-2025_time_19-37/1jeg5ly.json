He doesn\u2019t care if this is achieved by rolling over Ukraine and pulling it apart to share with Putin. \n\nThere is no way that Russia should be allowed to keep the land it invaded. And no way that it should be allowed to put any rules on Ukraine about its security arrangements going forward. \n\nUkraine stood by the agreement that required it to give up its nuclear weapons, only to not be given the security it was promised in return.  Then it jumped through all the hoops it was given to gain EU membership, only to have all this vetoed by Russian friendly EU member states. The EU must have known this would happen, so why make Ukraine dance in the first place? This laid Ukraine wide open for invasion. America covered them until it didn\u2019t.\n\nTrump negotiated (and tried to humiliate) Zelensky in public, only to conduct all conversations in private with Putin via telephone. Where is the parity there. Make demands of Ukraine and give concessions to Russia. There\u2019s no impartiality to that treatment. Luckily it was clear to the world that Trump was completely out of order in the tv \u201cshow\u201d and all that happened was more support for Ukraine internationally. As much as trump will say this was his plan, it obviously wasn\u2019t. \n\nEven Finland said today that it thinks Ukraine may have to give up seized territory in the same way that it did itself when it was invaded. I don\u2019t understand how it happening to Finland makes it ok for it to happen to Ukraine. It clearly doesn\u2019t. \n\nI feel so angry for Ukraine that it is trying to do the right thing every time, and is just being let down again and again. I realise that geopolitics is a complicated thing, but really in these modern times (it\u2019s not the 1800s any more, this behaviour should not be tolerated) modern leaders should be making an example to stand up for what is right.\n\nBillionaires are tearing the world apart, and I want to see justice done for Ukraine, because the human race should be better than this. Good people being attacked need to be given enough support to fight back effectively, and our own leaders as our representatives need to know how we feel, and ACT - fast",
