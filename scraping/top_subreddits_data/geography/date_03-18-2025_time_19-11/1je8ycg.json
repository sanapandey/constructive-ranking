If you want to understand municipal services, you must include other forms of municipalities.\u00a0",

Thus, cities with smaller land areas like Atlanta tend to have lower populations (pop. ~500,000), while cities with larger land areas like Jacksonville tend to have larger populations (pop. ~900,000). However, Atlanta is surrounded by large suburbs on nearly all sides, giving Metro Atlanta a population of *6.3 million*, more than ten times that of Atlanta proper. Jacksonville, by comparison, has few large suburbs and thus has a metro population of less than 2 million. Hell, while Jacksonville is the largest city in Florida, the Jacksonville metro is only the fourth-largest, behind South Florida (Miami), the Tampa Bay area, and Greater Orlando. \n\nIn a similar vein, county population can be a better indicator, as some cities take up rather small portions of their counties (e.g. Atlanta and Miami), while other cities *are* their counties (e.g. Jacksonville).",
