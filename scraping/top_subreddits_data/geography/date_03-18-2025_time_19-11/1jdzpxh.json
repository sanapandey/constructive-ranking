However, most commonly today, we see them divided based on geography and culture. This is why, while countries like the UK are not European by land connection, they are considered apart of the European continent. You can't just say it's not part of the continent, because if you look at any source it will be listed as one. This is a cultural factor that makes england apart of the European continent.\n\nIf history and culture are the best way to distinguish continents, then by all means the continent which encompasses Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific should be named Oceania. This is what it is called by most nations in the Oceania continent. The nations in Oceania all generally share a similar pacific culture, and the national histories of these nations are all interrelated. \n\nAnd generally, no, there is not any land that is considered to be not part of any continent. If you look up African nations, you will find listed Seychelles, Mauritius, and etc. Asian Countries you will find listed Japan, Sri Lanka, etc. Therefore the name of the continent you call Australia should be Oceania as it is more inclusive of the mainland of Australia, and the island nations in the pacific region that are considered part of Oceania. This does not mean that Australia isn't the continental mass, only that the name Australia only refers specifically to the country, when there are a much wider range of groups in the entire continental region.\n\nIn summary, there are no agreed upon characteristics for continents. Continents fo include islands that are culturally connected to the mainland. The nations in Oceania call the continent Oceania due to the cultural spread. There is no reason that the continent should be called Australia and be defined as solely the landmass of Australia, as other continents do not need to abide by this rule, having many other non-connected islands.",

Which obviously rules out any islands.\n\nI would not class any island as part of a continent as they arent on the same landmass as other countries you'd consider part of the continent.\n\nYour opinion clearly shows every country teaches the definition differently.

They didn't try to displace the natives like they did in Australia, America or Africa. They actually cooperated a lot with the natives (hence the \"Non-cooperation Movement\" was born to try to subvert British dominion of India). The fortunes of the old ruling class, like the Mughals, receded. But life for the average person didn't change that much. These in no way gave India any significant edge over any other nation of its stature and condition when it got its independence in 1947. But my point is India did not enter its new independent era a relic of the stone age. It had a fairly stable economy and a promising industrial base and a fairly capable and politically active ruling class. Had the Indians played their cards right, they could have become a legitimate superpower by now. People throw that term around regarding India a lot because it has been truly that big of a possibility for India to become a superpower. It's perplexing that it is still so far away from that prospect. Truly the only thing holding India back is India itself.",

The job market is so shit 80k - mostly well educated young people - left for other places last year where there is greater opportunity. And imo we are on track to become a third-world country in my lifetime the way we are failing to diversify our economy or create a higher percentage of high income jobs. We are also the most catastrophically bad at building infrastructure in the world. It's costs an absurd amount for even the smallest project, takes 3x longer than it would in America and we cancel them before a shovel hits the dirt 9 times outta 10. We are attempting the austerity measures england took that have practically ruined the NHS and other public services. Crime is up. House prices are insane. Rn I can only recommend moving here if you're bringing over lots of money from elsewhere. Finding a job is hard, and then stretching out the money you get is another difficulty.",
