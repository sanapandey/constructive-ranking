Why is that?\n\nOther questions:\n-They follow the same borders as the boroughs, but they are differently named. What\u2019s up with that? \n-What political or organizational roles/jurisdiction do the counties and boroughs hold compared to city and state? \n\n",

I am sharing a local custom derived from pre-consolidation NYC.

In the 19th & early 20th century, consolidation was a popular political concept in the US to harmonize neighboring towns and cities that were economically and socially interdependent. There was also a strong element of civic pride in annexing neighboring lower-density land with the unerring belief in the limitless prosperity of the city. In some cases, it was also a maneuver to get more land on the city property tax rolls from people who would intentionally settle outside the city limits to avoid paying higher in-municipality taxes. They would annex as far out as would have been considered too far to commute regularly to enjoy the benefits of the central business district.\n\nOther examples from that period of consolidation would be Philadelphia, PA which consolidated all the other municipalities in Philadelphia into the new municipal government of Philadelphia City-County. Other notable consolidated City-County governments in the US are San Francisco, CA and Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nThe reason why they are less common now is because secession is in vogue. There are many documented examples of neighborhoods and former municipalities seceding from their consolidated city government, largely due to disagreements over political, economic, and, all too often, racial/social issues. Atlanta, Georgia keeps fending off challenges from secessionists of predominantly (relatively) wealthy white voter enclaves. Many of the efforts explicitly cite their desire to exit the municipal public school system and use their higher property taxes to fund better quality schools. However, as a separate municipality and school district, they can decline to accept students from Atlanta who also fall within the catchment area, often enforcing a historical redline that technically doesn't exist anymore except everywhere you look.\n\nThe other main motives for consolidation of increasing political power in the face of the state and federal government is perceived to be less important since it is conceivably easier to interact with these entities with the use of electronic communications and a generally more transparent political process, thanks to the Freedom of Information and similar state laws. Computers have also simplified a lot of administrative tasks by making it possible to get or submit official information with minimal effort, thereby obviating some of the need for creating centralized municipal bureaucracies to pool resources.",

Originally contained the city of New York on the southern tip but also the various towns/villages located in Manhattan that was not part of the city of NY. Examples include Greenwich Village, Village of Harlem, etc\n\nCity of New York --> the original city on the southern tip that expanded to encompass the entirety of Manhattan Island (and co-existed with the County of New York) before expanding to include all 5 boroughs with the 1898 consolidation.\n\nA very similar process happened in Brooklyn. The original city of Brooklyn was located at what we will call the Brooklyn Heights. Other notable towns/villages include Gravesend, Flatbush, New Utrecht, Bushwick. All of which was in Kings County. Over time, the city of Brooklyn expanded to occupy all of the County of Kings.\n\nQueens, Richmond and the Bronx did not undergo the same rapid expansion that the City of New York or the City of Brooklyn did.

The first verse had the line \"The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame\" as reference to the Brooklyn Bridge which ran between the City of New York and Brooklyn.\n\nWhen the consolidation of 1898 happened, arguably Brooklyn lost out as it was the only one that sacrificed city status.\n\nMany of what you expect a county to do still happens on county level in NYC.
