It's common in the western US to see land owned in a checkerboard pattern, with every other plot being private/public. This was done when the government was giving out land grants to railroad companies. They wanted to give out free land to incentive railroads to build, but they didn't want large tracts of land that the railroad companies would hold on to and manage. They intended for the railroads to have several small, disconnected plots of land that they would then sell to private buyers. The other leftover plots were retained as public land that was open to the Homestead Act (free land for settlers). Lots of that public land was never settled because it was either not suitable for settlement or because the government had some interest in keeping it public. The unlogged areas in your picture are probably owned by the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management, and the logged areas are likely privately owned (or public lands leased to a private company.)",
