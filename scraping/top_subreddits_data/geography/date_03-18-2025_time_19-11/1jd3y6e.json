    "selftext": "Hey r/geography, please join us for an AMA with Dr. Mike Kuby, Professor Emeritus of Geography at Arizona State University\u00a0and co-founder of Maptasy, a new fantasy sports game with board-game strategy on a MAP. Ask Mike Anything!\n\nMaptasy Sports introduces the first-ever fantasy sports draft for the NCAA Women's and Men's Basketball Championship Tournaments with *Maptasy for March Mania*, available March 17th. The draft board/game board is a map with 68 territories\u2014one for each team. Draft strategy is key - your picks must be adjacent to each other, unless you get \u201cboxed in\u201d with no available picks, in which case you lose a turn but can jump behind enemy lines to establish a satellite empire. Once the draft ends, root for your teams to advance, score big by upsetting higher seeds, and knock out other people\u2019s teams! Maptasy is for 2 to 12 players. Check it out at [www.maptasy.com](http://www.maptasy.com/).\n\nFor 36 years, Mike taught classes in transportation, human geography, geography of world crises, geography of China, and facility location and modeling. He co-authored the interactive textbook *Human Geography in Action*, which was used in college and AP Human Geography classes.\u00a0\n\nMike\u2019s research specialty is transportation and geospatial optimization, where he focused on electric and alt-fuel vehicles, driver surveys, and optimal station network planning over the last 20 years. Other research areas have included light rail, airlines, carbon capture and storage pipeline networks, dam removal to restore fish migration, and facility dispersion.\n\nBefore becoming a geography\u00a0 professor, he invented the abstract strategy board game Traverse (aka Taifho in Europe), combining the piece movement of chess with the gameplay of Chinese Checkers. AMA - Ask Mike Anything on Monday March 17 at 5:30 PDT.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owhsat5h96pe1.jpg?width=3663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a9e786d6af17ac9a879404b6fd5d87e010d7dd5\n\nThis AMA was approved by the r/geography mods.\n\n>Thanks to everyone who stopped by this AMA. I'm happy to continue answering questions here even though it's officially out of time. There might be a bit of delay before I answer, now that it's over. Thanks to the r/geography mods for help setting this up.\n>\n>For those who want to learn more about Maptasy, I recommend going to the [Sample Games](https://maptasy.com/sample-games) page and using the slider or the animation button to watch replays of the Draft and the Results for an 8-team draft for the 2023 Men's tournament. You can toggle between Draft and Results using the 2 tabs above the words Game Replay. Every league will have a page like this where you can watch these 2 kinds of replays of your league.\n>\n>",

We then plot the points in a GIS and then run a tool called Create Thiessen Polygons. These are also called a Voronoi Diagram. They are defined by the entire area of each polygon being closer to that campus than to any other of the points. Each polygon boundary is in fact a \"perpendicular bisectors\" between two neighboring points. That's how we generate the territories for each school.",

Will they automatically get something like best available seed on the map?",

            "body": "The idea for Maptasy came from 3 PhD students in geography at ASU. They loved college basketball and GIS (geographic information systems) and sitting around talking about sports and GIS. They came up with the idea of mapping the 68 teams in the tournament, and then dividing the country into the Thiessen polygons defining the areas closer to each team than to any other team. But that first year, what they did next was run a clustering algorithm using the 1 and 2 seeds as the \u201cgeographic seeds\u201d. This generated eight compact and contiguous regions around the 1 and 2 seeds. Their plan was to then take turns choosing one of the eight clusters, with plenty of debate and trash talking ensuing.\u00a0 They invited five other grad students to join them at a campus bar to take turns choosing clusters.\n\nThe following year, one student graduated and one of the grad students, who worked with me on his dissertation, asked me to replace that student. When they told me about it, I remember saying \u201cHold on, you are letting the computer have all the fun. You\u2019re letting the computer make the clusters. We need to turn this into a team-by-team draft with the rule that any subsequent pick must be adjacent to a previous pick. And let\u2019s not require that players start with a 1 or 2 seed - your first pick needs to be a strategic decision, and you might want to start with, for instance, a 4 seed that is adjacent to several higher seeds.\u201d That\u2019s how Maptasy started!",

In the Men's map it's McNeese State and Troy. Here I am showing you a zoomed in screenshot from our GIS work last night when we made the maps. Look at the tip of the Mississippi delta and you will see that the very end of the peninsula is part of another polygon, for Troy College. But when you're at normal full-USA zoom in the game, you can't see that. You'll think \"how can they be touching - there's Mississippi St and Alabama in between.\" But if you zoom in on the game board, you will see it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzuyx0mswcpe1.jpeg?width=1181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dea78806522bccee46d53618016ec9e37785f7e",

An that's because we didn't remove the islands off the Southern California coast, and the UCLA and UCSD polygons actually touch out on San Clemente Island. So if you play, I'm giving you a couple of inside tips here and also a peek behind the scenes into how the sausage is made. Also, the dots are not shown in the game but I am turning on that layer here so you can see how the boundaries are actually perpendicular bisectors between neighboring teams.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4u7rh2ezcpe1.jpeg?width=702&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc4101315690df2a206ec76068e52cb3662602",
