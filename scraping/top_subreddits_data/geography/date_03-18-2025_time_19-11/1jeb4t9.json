Are there any areas of rhe U.S. that meet ALL of the following criteria?:\n\n- Heavily blue/left-leaning\n- Rural or VERY low density suburban\n- Wealthy (at least somewhat)\n- Not in New England (CT/RI/MA/VT/NH/ME)\n- Not super touristy (disqualifies a lot of coastal areas)\n\nAs many rural regions across the U.S. are red, poor, or both, I am curious if there any examples of this? I don\u2019t know U.S. geography well enough to think of any myself.",

Other suburban counties on the metro ofc.\n\nI\u2019d be curious to dive into OPs examples in the Northeast and see if there\u2019s truly a phenomena of rural counties and precincts composed almost entirely of farmers and homesteaders that vote blue.
