Several hundred soldiers killed in skirmishes, and nuclear forces put on alert to where Mao and the leadership left Beijing. \n\nWhile the dispute cooled down, that near-miss of nuclear war shook the Chinese leadership out of the post Sino-Soviet split isolation and into rapprochement with the West.

'black bear island'), is a sedimentary island at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers. Since the Sino-Russian Border Agreement that was fully implemented in 2008, Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island was divided between China and Russia. China was given control over part of the island, and Russia retained the rest. Since then, the issue has been peacefully settled, and China no longer claims the entire island.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshoy\\_Ussuriysky\\_Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshoy_Ussuriysky_Island)",
