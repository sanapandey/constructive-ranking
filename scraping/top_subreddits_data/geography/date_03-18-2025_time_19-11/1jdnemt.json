Volcanic soils, known as Andisols, are typically extremely fertile due to the mineral-rich volcanic ash and lava that break down over time, releasing essential nutrients like phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. These nutrients enhance soil fertility and water retention, making volcanic regions prime agricultural land.\n\nThe Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, where these cinder cones are located, has historically supported large-scale farming due to this fertility. Crops like maize, beans, avocados, and other staple foods thrive in these soils. Additionally, Mexico's Michoac\u00e1n region\u2014where some of these cinder cones are found\u2014is famous for avocado farming, which benefits greatly from the volcanic soil's ability to hold moisture and nutrients.\n\nThe combination of volcanic soil, mild climate, and abundant rainfall makes this region an agricultural powerhouse. So yes, the extensive farming visible in the image is very likely enhanced by the volcanic discharge that enriched the land over centuries.",
