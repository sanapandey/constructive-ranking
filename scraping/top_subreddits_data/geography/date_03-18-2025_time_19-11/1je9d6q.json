Local discriminatory rules around segregation and housing discrimination were struck down largely by putting into place federal-level regulations that pre-empted them, which also effectively standardized many local regulations and restrictions into one unified federal-level policy.\n\nLand use regulation and zoning reforms, similarly, are frequently being tackled by passing statewide pre-emptions (though many have argued we should be passing federal pre-emptions) to override local exclusionary zoning/building regulations. For example, some states have passed statewide pre-emptions of local multifamily family development restrictions that prevent duplex/triplex/multiplex construction. This prevents having to reform hundreds or thousands of locally entrenched good old boy networks that may have vested interests in exclusionary housing practices, and again standardizes many disparate local regulations into one broader policy.",

The rich neighborhoods need to build their fair share of housing, and they don't. \n\nFor example, in Washington DC, they very rarely build any significant developments in upper Northwest DC even though the area is ripe for development, next to a Metro, has great under-enrolled schools, low crime rates, and so on - because of all the rich NIMBYs with money, power, and influence. The result is that all of the development is concentrated in NE and SE, which are historically majority-black neighborhoods, leading to the displacement of these black households by white and wealthy families. \n\nRE: Gentrification - I like the word displacement better. Gentrification generally means redevelopment, but redevelopment results in displacement, which is the real issue. Redeveloping and upgrading areas would not be bad if there was no displacement. Just my 2 cents! :)",

States and big cities must set up a fund that loans out money with low interest rates for developers in exchange for a high housing affordability percentage. For example - a 4% interest loan means that developers must have at least 15% of the units affordable, etc. \n\nPart of the issue with high construction costs is many things that are out of the control of governments. Take LA as an example: they need to mandate fire-resistant structures in fire-risk areas, which makes construction more expensive. Then on top of that, variable interest rates and economic conditions, supply chain issues (including the stupid fucking tariffs), etc... and there's not a whole lot that you can do via mandates to lower construction costs. Sure, you could eliminate the solar panel requirement on new housing, but that only cuts the cost by about $20K, out of an average price of like $700K in California.",

This is faulty logic just cause people also leave the housing they were in previously to go to the more expensive housing, which opens up housing on the lower end\n\nI also see people saying \"I don't want ugly, corporate, glass 5/1 buildings. Put some effort in and make it look like the rest of the city\". This definitely makes sense, but the problem is, whenever you implement rules and regulations around something like this, then people exploit it as a reason to absolutely never build any housing by saying it \"doesn't look nice enough\"\n\nI think we're in a generally pretty bad situation in blue states. I'm not sure how we can fix it, because we're like 10 years behind on building",

Like you said N.Y. and California are still going to lose some representation but they are not hemorrhaging people.\n\nFlorida doesn't really have a robust economy and I'm kinda tired of hearing people pretend that it does. Most of the population growth is geriatric, and if you were to strip away the tourism and federal subsidies there would be very little left.\n\nFloridian tourism depends on visitors from elsewhere coming and spending their money in the state. Most of those people are coming from the blue states that Florida's state government is so actively antagonizing, and are likely reducing their spend in Florida proportionate to how put off they are. Tons of retirees unable to work and collapsing demand from tourists who can easily go elsewhere is not a recipe for a thriving Florida.",

Most importantly, what is the republican party going to do without trump. That's what is going to shape the political climate for the next couple of elections.\n\nNot to mention, you're vastly overestimating the staying trend of politics. As these population trends change, so do their voting trends. I mean, even in 2016 Ohio was a \"swing state. 2020 it was Nevada. Now both are pretty firm, while it's states like Pennsylvania, Georgia and Virginia. Texas has been republican for a while, but they were one of the closest states in 2020, and have been slowly shifting more blue in local elections for decades. \n\nI mean, it's important to remember that the margins for most states is like 10-15%. Both parties are designed to have as broad support as possible, and to stay close to 50/50. California has the most Republican voters, likewise Texas has the second most democratic voters.

For example Biden's victory in 2020 would still hold as a EC victory in 2032.\n\nThe best bet for Dems is probably GA and NC. Especially Georgia has been trending blue and has strong population growth. Dems have down really well with college educated professionals who make up the bulk of migrants to these states (versus retirees in FL and AZ). If both GA and NC would flip blue, you could even win with the loss of one blue wall state (assuming Nevada flips back).",

More people are moving in than are dying. \n\n\n\n[Someone that is 65 in Florida is expected to live another 19.2 years](https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/2023/12/18/florida-life-expectancy-state-ranking-how-long-expect-live/71956815007/#)\n\n\n\n\nThat means a house someone retires to down there is likely off the market for 20 years, while a lot more people will be looking to retire down there and need to build a new house or wait them out.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, there will still be boomers in their 80s and still living in Florida when the millennials start to become retirement age as well. As long Florida is the retirement spot there will be people filing in.\n\n\nNow if you\u2019re saying Florida has problems, I agree. The insurance crisis might cripple them.",

Climate stable, no shortage of fresh water and abundant, excellent farmland.  Costs are relatively cheap outside of Chicago, and it really only takes one winter to get an understanding of how to deal with it.\n\nIdk, just kinda shooting my shot here.",

The state population was 13 million back then. It\u2019s 23 million+ now. If it were to be such a huge deterrent, then it would have already been one back then when it was actually a lot closer to memory.
