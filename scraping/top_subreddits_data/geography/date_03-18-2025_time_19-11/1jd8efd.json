The region is so large, populous and developed, and the traffic between Wuchang and Guanggu is so bad, that people living inside and people in the three old towns have little in common.\n\nThe Qingshan District in the northeast was developed in the 1950s because Hanyang was to small for the new steel factory. People there feel no connection with people in Wuchang either. I've also heard about people from Dongxihu or Hannan claiming that they have no idea about old Hankou or Hanyang.",

The name Berlin is of Slavic origin, so it has been assumed K\u00f6lln/C\u00f6lln (spelling varies) is too, though no Slavic language records have been found there.\n\nHowever, AFAIK it may be transference of the name of the city by the Rhine, and so it might be a German settlement using the name of a German city. The Romans certainly were never there. In historical documents written in Latin, I think it has been called \"Colonia juxta Berlin\" (from around the 12th century I believe).",

It can be confusing to anyone not familiar with the situation, particularly people from Upstate or Western NY who may not have any idea what Yonkers is!",

                            "body": "I\u2019m actually from Thunder Bay haha, so fun to see it mentioned here and I used to be an \u201cAmbassador\u201d for the University so I can tell you more than you\u2019d like to know ;)\n\nThe area has been long populated by the Native Anishinaabe peoples who were nomadic along the rivers, and would go to Thunder Bay, where the outlet of the Kaministiqua River is, to trade amongst one another. There is a reasonably large mountain there which was called Thunder Mountain (Anemkii Wadij) and the bay was similarly called Thunder Bay. Anishinaabe didn\u2019t have names for areas per se, but did have names for geographic features, so that also made this a good meeting location between the mountain, huge sheltered bay which is the result of a huge peninsula rock formation called \u201cthe Sleeping Giant\u201d (Nanabijou), and the river outlet.\n\nWhen the white people came, this was the obvious location for a European/Indigenous trading post, so they built one and called it Fort William. Some First Nations folks began living full time in the Fort vicinity (often because they were the children of men from the Fort) and they became Fort William First Nation. Along the way, the Europeans renamed Thunder Mountain \u201cMount McKay\u201d after a man from the Fort. Many Native people from the area have the last name McKay because they are his descendants.\n\nLater when shipping became an industry, they built a port up the shore line a bit and called it Port Arthur. The two locations continued to develop into two small cities with a forest between them and a few roads that connected them. Eventually, it seemed like a smart idea to properly connect these two small cities that were so close in an otherwise pretty remote area. Canadians in the mid 1900s had begun to refer to that area generally as \u201cthe Lakehead\u201d because it\u2019s the head of the Lake (Superior), and also the head of all the Great Lakes.\n\nNames were proposed for the new city. Obviously Thunder Bay was proposed, as well as \u201cLakehead\u201d and \u201cThe Lakehead.\u201d Well, it ended up being a vote split between \u201cLakehead\u201d and \u201cthe Lakehead,\u201d so Thunder Bay won! And so now that\u2019s all history. \n\nPersonally I am extremely glad. I believe Indigenous names should be used whenever and wherever they existed, so bringing back Thunder Bay felt like divine intervention :) now it would be nice too to rename Mount McKay to Thunder Mountain, but I suppose quite a few Indigenous people are named McKay now so there hasn\u2019t been a huge push for it probably in part because Thunder Bay is properly Thunder Bay at least, and the Sleeping Giant is still known by his name too.\n\nThey went on to remove the forest that separated the two cities and built a University called Lakehead University! I\u2019m a proud Alumni. They also built a college called Confederation College, and a mall, amongst other things. That area is called \u201cIntercity\u201d because it\u2019s the area that was once between the two cities.",

Old Oslo was another old town founded by a different Norwegian king about a 1000 years ago. Over the years old Oslo suffered from large city fires and black death, so in 17th century a Danish king Christian who ruled the area decided to build a brand new city next to the Original Oslo and named it Christiania (what a coincidence!). It was a planned city with straight grid of broad streets, with buildings for king's residence, a stock exchange, government, and eventually a university, a big railway station, etc. Meanwhile, the old Oslo eventually declined an turned into a village next to a new city.\n\nWhen Norway got independence in early 20th century they decided to rename Christiania - mostly to annoy the Danes. So they gave it \"a historical name\" of Oslo, which is honestly very stupid. It's like renaming Newark to \"New York City\" because it's built close enough to Manhattan island.\n\nAfter the second World War they decided to merge Christiania-Oslo with nearby Aker. At the time Aker was almost 30 times larger, and unlike Oslo it never devolved into a tiny village. And yet instead of giving the new big city a *proper* historical name Aker they used a pseudo-historical \"Oslo\". I bet if Christiania wasn't renamed earlier, they would pick Aker as a name. And if you look at the map, you'll see \"Aker\" everywhere. The main river is named after Aker, the main fortress is named after Aker, half of the borrows and streets are Aker-something (like Aker brygge), etc. etc.\n\nThe city should have been named Aker, and the name \"Oslo\" is a big scam.",

Canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill, with the border between the two formed by the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. In the history of the city of Zagreb, there have been numerous conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, mainly due to disputed issues of rent collection and due to disputed properties. The first known conflicts took place in the middle of the 13th century and continued with interruptions until 1667. Because of the conflict, it was recorded that the Bishop of Kaptol excommunicated the residents of Gradec twice. In the conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, there were several massacres of the citizens, destruction of houses and looting of citizens. In 1850, Gradec and Kaptol, with surrounding settlements, were united into a single settlement, today\u2019s city of Zagreb. Interestingly, the bridge that connects the two townes was called the Bloody Bridge, due to the frequent battles and conflicts that took place on it. Today, the bridge\u2019s location is occupied by a small street of the same name, which connects Kaptol and Gornji Grad.",

There's some nuance to that, like I think the wards technical carry out stuff like waste disposal, but how they do it is governed by the Tokyo Met. Variously over the last ~90 years, the wards have not been considered local governments for the purpose of constitutional rights, and then have been, and have not been allowed to elect mayors, and then have been, and have had varying levels of fiscal independence from the greater Tokyo government. Legally, these kinds of special wards can be established anywhere in Japan, but to date only exist in Tokyo. \n\nI'm not smart enough to dig deeply into what all this means in practice and how the governments work, but it's an interesting thing to read about if you've got the time.
