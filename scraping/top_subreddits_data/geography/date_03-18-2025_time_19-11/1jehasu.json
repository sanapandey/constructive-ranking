    "selftext": "This question was prompted by wondering how NASA and other space organizations choose to land their rovers on huge celestial bodies like Mars and the Moon. I'm sure there is a list of criteria, but I thought it would be interesting to think about from the perspective of an alien entity discovering Earth. For the hypothetical, let's assume that there is no population (or maybe we don't know if there is a population). Using the methodology NASA uses today to plan missions to Mars and the Moon, where would rovers likely land, if they knew nothing else really about the planet?I would imagine large open areas would be appealing for a safe landing, as well as potentially areas with rich biodiversity. I always hear of our rovers landing in canyons or craters on the moon and Mars. Where would be those equivalents on Earth be? What are the most likely places an expedition would identify as an ideal place to land and explore?",

Just out of mechanical feasibility for a rover. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know enough about our sensory capabilities to have an accurate idea of the resolution we\u2019d have. Would we know enough to be able to distinguish forests for example?",

As long as there are large, flat, treeless areas, being between the tropics would offer more sunlight for charging. And, depending on the capabilities of the rovers, Africa (like North America) provides access to a huge amount of explorable terrain.",
