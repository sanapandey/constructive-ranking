    "selftext": "Mount Bokty, standing at 165 meters, is a natural landmark in Kazakhstan's Mangystau region. Its striking layers of white, yellow, coral, and brown come from ancient sedimentary deposits, formed when the area was covered by a prehistoric ocean. Over millions of years, mineral rich waters and erosion sculpted its unique, otherworldly appearance.",
