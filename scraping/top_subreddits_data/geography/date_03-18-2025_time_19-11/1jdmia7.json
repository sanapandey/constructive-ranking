In most places this means security for courts and transportation of prisoners but can also look like tax collection (Louisville). Because most state constitutions require localities to have an elected sheriff, at some point mayors or councils, with the encouragement of state legislation, created a municipal police department which, instead, reports to the mayor/councils/manager. Denver\u2019s is a weird quirk because they have both a sheriff and police department and it\u2019s the only place in Colorado where the sheriff isn\u2019t elected.

The City at the time figured that the easiest way to increase their tax base was to absorb surrounding (and already incorporated, unlike much of the country) lands. So the districts Brighton, Dorchester, Charlestown, Roxbury, West Roxbury, and Hyde Park were all their own towns at one point, and then voted to merge with Boston for the services benefit and Boston in turn received more tax revenue. At the time, only what was (and still is to a degree) within \"Boston proper\" was developed and these neighboring towns were still pretty rural. The sprawl came later. \n\nI believe New York's boundaries were set in a similar fashion. Its city limits have been in place for a while and well before urban sprawl in the vicinity.",
