We were really poor so when I was small we had a tiny camping style black and white TV. So my earliest memories of TV are literally Black and White, just like my Mum who was born in 1960. She didn't realise this until I told her recently. She was so confused why I would remember black and white TV until she remembered that we'd been using the tiny camping TV when I was 2-4 years old. Then it made sense. \n\nI also mostly had hand me down toys and stuff from op shops so a lot of my toys were from the 70s and 80s. So even though I was born in the early 90s I had a very anachronistic childhood. \n\nWe didn't even have a computer in the house until It was 2008 and I was in grade 12... And it was just a cheap one my boyfriend (now husband) built me out of spare parts so I could type up my assignments. It had an 8gb hard drive.  \ud83d\ude02 it was woefully out of date even then, but it did what I needed it to.",
