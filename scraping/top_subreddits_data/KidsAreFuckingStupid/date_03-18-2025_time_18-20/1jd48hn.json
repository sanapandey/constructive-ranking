Sure, you pay taxes while you live, you breathe while you live, but the amount of tax isn't related to the amount of air you breathe.\n\nTelling the kid breathing isn't free is misleading to the point of being ignorant.",

Poor air quality could lead to people paying money for clean air. Part of our taxes do go towards efforts made under the clean air act.",

I used to do that after every prayer when I was a kid like it was my little handshake with God lol\n\nAlso someone told me their uncle was strangled by a demon in his sleep when I was in elementary school, so I started sleeping on my side to make it harder for a demon to sit on top and strangle me. I still sleep on my side because I feel too vulnerable on my back or stomach in case *something* strangles me",
