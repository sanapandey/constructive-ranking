So cleaning drops, like debrox, can do a better overall job by dissolving wax without provoking more.\n\nI use that once a month or so. In between, but not daily, I use little soft plastic ear scoops, one brand is clinere. Still better than qtip because no lint, and the scoop means that you can actually get a good bit of solid wax out.",

So, I took this tiny little water jet and used it to spray little jets of warm water up my ear until all the wax fell out. The immediate pressure relief when the biggest chunk blocking my ear drums came out was euphoric, and the jets of water felt great in my ear canal. You would be surprised how much wax can accumulate up there if it's not falling out for some reason. In my case, I suspect it was from always sleeping on the same side, so gravity was never removing was from my ears the natural way. Since then, I have always used those little scrapers to get wax out of my ears since Q-Tips will just push that shit in further.",

The same lipid that makes earwax wet is also produced by the sweat glands, and bacteria eating this lipid is what makes the smell.",
