She had bolted back inside and us yelling for her scared her and made her go in the closet and hide under a blanlet. We felt so bad we had clearly scared her pretty bad with the yelling. When you see parents tugging kids away from roads or anything its because they HAVE to be super vigilant and have likely had a \"holy fuck wheres my kid\" moment which is utterly terrifying.",

She's not in here with you?\" \n\nI BOLTED UP and said 'What did you say?!' then we ran around yelling and panicking, couldn't find her in the house after looking everywhere. Couldn't find her in the yard. She wasn't next door, she wasn't at the park right next to the house. I was looking in the woods, and he headed back to the house to check around the LAKE behind his house cause I couldn't stomach the idea of me finding her.. Ya know.. Floating.. \n\nHe gets to where he's passing the house to check the lake, and he hears her crying, INSIDE THE HOUSE. \n\nShe wanted to \"play a trick\" on my fiance, so she went to play hide and seek but didn't tell him he was seeking. She wedged herself behind this mattress he was replacing that was leaning longways against a wall in the spare bedroom, and she fell asleep while she was hiding. She woke up to people yelling, but couldn't hear what we were yelling cause we were over by the park, so she came to find us, realized she was alone and got scared and started crying. I have never felt so much dread and panic, and then so much relief within like 10 minutes in my entire life.",

It was so cozy and nice inside the tree that I fell asleep. \n\nWake up hours later, headache, it's night time and cold, I hear all kinds of screaming and it's scary. It takes me a while, but I start realizing that all the screaming was my name over and over. I crawl out of the tree to look, and someone spotted me right away. They scream \"I found her!!\" And for some reason that made me think I was gonna get kidnapped, I don't know why lol. I ran and started screaming for my mom, they eventually corner me and bring her around. Lots of tears and scoldings.\n\nI learned later that the entire park got shut down. They stopped the wedding. The bride was even still wearing her dress and looking around when they found me. I felt so bad.",

The driver, who had people from work in the back, had fast reflex and swerved into the other side of the curb to avoid them. I stood there and watched, my whole body going cold and it literally happened right in front of the police station.\n\nI could already see the police taking me in to ask what happened and I could see myself getting in trouble but at the same time I was so freaking relieved that nothing happened to my sibling.\n\nBack then I blamed myself for not paying better attention. Everytime I remember this - I still do - I kept thinking how bad it would've ended if the driver didn't react so fast.\n\nIt's almost 30 years later and it still hurt my heart when I think about it.",

She made it 1 foot out of the door when we caught her but it was only when she made it to the door that we noticed she was going for it and I leapt to grab her.

He will envision the other potential version of this story for years and years. \n\nI try to remind myself that remembering the near misses is how we plan against it... the haunting of our most terrifying memories is what keeps us alive.

Just look at the cybertruck, the ENTIRE selling point is \"it's durable\" meaning it has no crumple zone. It is the epitome of car driver entitlement, expecting that OTHER cars will have crumple zones and be destroyed (and have a high likelihood to kill the driver) all so that the cybertruck driver doesn't need to go through the hassle of getting THEIR car fixed. Also SUVs and pickup trucks which are very deadly because the hood is so raised that any collision with a person causes so much more damage to their body.\n\nCities especially are becoming more and more hostile to human life in exchange for car convenience.\n\nI'd argue that at this point, a leash for a kid is a requirement. It is frankly too dangerous. If you have the sheer AUDACITY to step on a crosswalk in a red light, you get honked at and a car will just drive through the crosswalk anyways. EVEN THOUGH IT'S A RED LIGHT.\n\nYou can be the best parent ever, teach your kid to look both ways twice, always hold your hand, and still getting hit by a car is a high risk because cars like SUVs and pickup trucks are so raised they cannot see a child. Heck, they often can't even see a short adult.",

In a place like Disneyland, no, you cannot have your kids all running the full length of the leash constantly or they will trip everyone around them. (Same would go for a dog in a crowded setting like that though.)\n\nIn a park where you have an older kid that wants to play on the swings but a younger kid that just wants to hurl herself into traffic, I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to sit on a bench and let the little one roam around on the edge of the leash. \n\nAlso if you have a situation where the kid is walking alongside you just fine without their hand being held, it\u2019s perfectly fine to not be in constant contact with their hand. Maybe they have one hand holding a teddy bear and the other hand with some cotton candy and they are keeping up. Not all kids want their hand to be held 24/7. \n\nAlso maybe you have two hands pushing a stroller or you have to stop and lean down to tie somebody\u2019s shoe. \n\nThe world is so much more complicated than people make it\n\nYou are damned right about swimming though!",

In fact people theorize that a perfect mother would be harmful because it\u2019s not good to have every single need met. So they actually say you need a \u201cgood enough mother.\u201d And of course, how good enough is enough is a matter of debate. \n\nBut you also have to stop and think about things, like, what if the parent is indeed slightly erring on the neglectful side? In most cases, the amount of harm caused by people taking children away from their parents is so enormous we need to see a lot of harm being caused before that makes it worth it. \n\nAnd ultimately, the leash isn\u2019t the problem in thise cases. I\u2019m guessing there are a ton of other factors that are causing a problem like that, which the leash is only partly solving. Things like the parent having ADHD, the parent having a hard time with work and being very stressed out, one of the parents being abusive to the other parent, the kid having a disability, somebody having a really bad year, the family being food insecure, the parents worried about their housing, the mom being incredibly lonely and having a hard time with emotional regulation and relying on dating apps as a way to continue to not kill herself\u2014it really is an issue where 1000 things could be going on that would need to be addressed that are *not* the leash. \n\nAnd ultimately, in cases where leashes aren\u2019t used ideally, it may truly be the best case scenario that is achievable for that particular parent and that particular child at that particular time for that kid to be on a leash. \n\nAnd then of course, when people start making proclamations about who should be allowed to have children in the first place and who shouldn\u2019t, they are veering into eugenics, which doesn\u2019t ultimately do a great job. \n\nSo basically, leashes are not the problem. Just let people keep doing their best.",

Your kid could get their leg caught in their blanket and trip out of bed and break their neck because they had to go pee in the middle of the night. Your dog could spill its water bowl in the kitchen and your kid slips and cracks his head on the counter while going to get a juice box. This guy could have had a leash on his kid but if it was an extra inch or two too long then the kid would die anyway if he waddled out just far enough. Splat before the rope could even be pulled taut.\n\n\nWhen you have kids you just need to accept that they could be taken from you at any given moment regardless of what you do or don't do. There is literally no point in helicopter parenting and trying to micromanage them with something like a leash. It may give you some placebo peace of mind, but you aren't actually saving them.\n\n\nedit: Thanks for the downvotes everyone. They really changed my mind. Oh wait, they didn't. You want to know the best way to keep your kids safe? Kill yourselves so you aren't a blight on their existence with your stupidity. If leashes actually saved kids they'd be as prolific as something like a car seat or the mouth shield on a pacifier. But go ahead and keep believing in something most of the human population doesn't use because it's a waste of time. I'm sure that kind of sensibility is going to be a boon for your children.

The paint markings on the road don't change that at all, they're not some divine magical force. \n\nDo we just stop driving? No, everything has a calculated risk and reward.

There's no point hating or shitting on one particular country. Yes, India is not a perfect place by any stretch of the imagination. There's a lot left to be desired. It's not for beginners. There's safety concerns for Women & Travelers. There's many other things which are wrong. There's a LOT of scope for improvement on many areas. But then, things are also improving substantially on many fronts: whether its Infrastructure, Povery Reduction, Rural Electrification, Grid Modernization, Solar / Wind / Nuclear Adoption, and so many other things. It's not a lost cause. So it's also not worth getting all this generalized racial / cultural snark & hate. That's a fair point.",

While at the zoo, I fell in love with their albino alligator King Louie, and got a stuffed King Louie of my own from the gift shop that came with a leash (idk, seems weird but I\u2019m pretty sure it was intended to be a leash). I walked around the rest of the day with my lil dude on the leash. We were crossing at a cross walk at a busy intersection, with me (the youngest of the family) riding the tail. King Louis slipped out of the leash and I ran back the couple feet to get him and almost got hit by a car. My mom basically had a mini heart attack and was so upset she refused to talk to me for the rest of the day (or maybe just hours? Idk, a child\u2019s mind works different).  The incident wasn\u2019t spoken of until 2 decades later when my brother, out of context, mentioned the day I almost died. I simply replied \u201cahh, the St. Louis incident, right?\u201d And my mom, who has apparently blocked it from her memory until she heard that, got mad at me all over again. When I pointed out that I was walking in the back and no one had their eye on me, she had an \u201coh fuck\u201d expression but didn\u2019t say anything. I suspect that memory has been locked back up in the deepest parts of her brain.\n\n\nETA- holy cow I just looked up my old pal Louie, and not only is he still alive but he\u2019s older than me. Long live the king!",

As soon as I put the books down, she ran to the back of the car and turned into the street. I think she only got one foot into the street when I grabbed her, but moments later a large SUV drove past.
