The amount of people and resources that responded, just insane. Then she lies to the cops and they catch her in the lies.\n\n\nOne of the dumbest kids ever. I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up in juvenile detention for that. It would be deserved as well. Even her parents were pissed and told her basically \"too bad, youre being arrested now. Should have thought about that\"",

That seems creepy to me.\n\nEdit: Apparently this is not a popular viewpoint. I believe at that stage in life, adolescents are entitled to a bit of privacy (situationally dependent obviously as all things are). You are all ok with parents or whoever going through her underwear because they suspect something. But you would not be ok with them installing a camera to catch her doing something right? Also, what if she is trying to hide something she has a right to be private with, like a vibrator or some other more risqu\u00e9 thing? All I am saying is this is an age where privacy is a huge issue to them. And as a father/mother do you really want to know \"everything\" your child does? Trust me, you don't. You can guide kids and educate them, but to a certain extent, you have to let them have their own experiences. That is what makes them actual people.",

They are almost an adult. Let's hope their D grades magically turn into B with no studying and them continuing to waste time. You should limit or take away things that are hindering them succeeding.

Then when she suddenly found the COPS involved (scariest thing in the world to an 11-year-old) she panicked and backpedaled hard to try to get herself out of it, but got arrested anyway and freaked out. \n\nAll this is to say, this strikes me as less malice and entitlement, and more as impulsivity, ignorance, and fear. And an undeveloped prefrontal cortex.\n\nThis was probably the best way all this could have unfolded, tbh\u2014unless she has some other sort of psychological issue such as ODD or something (which we are NOT going to armchair diagnose on r/kidsarefuckingstupid, okay?) she will probably have this lesson VIVIDLY imprinted on her memory forever. \n\nTl;dr: Kids are fucking stupid, not necessarily blights on society.",

Partially because the parents won\u2019t make it clear what is okay and what\u2019s not, and partially because of abuse or neglect in the household. Eventually the kid will partake in rebellious behaviors and bam, you have one big shitty situation.\n\nIf you watch the video and pay attention to how the parents talk to their daughter, there are definitely some red flags despite it being a good thing that they\u2019re holding her accountable.\n\nProblem children are usually the direct cause of problem parents. I\u2019m not saying with 100% certainty that there was neglect or abuse, but I felt like it had to be mentioned as a possibility because most of these comments aren\u2019t considering how stuff like this happens in the first place and label it as a problem child.",

It\u2019s older than 7 sure, but I honestly think an 11 year old would have a worse reaction to this than a 7 year old because they understand less abstractly what exactly is going to happen to her. Again, not saying she didn\u2019t deserve those consequences, she did! But eleven years old is literally pre-puberty for many. She isn\u2019t even old enough to make a Facebook profile. That is a full child. \n\nTo me (I work with kids for a living) the meltdown she has while getting arrested doesn\u2019t strike me as a bratty kid losing her shit because she\u2019s not getting her way or simple because she\u2019s getting in trouble. That looks more like she is terrified, is extremely disregulated (emotional regulation is much harder for children than adults under even the best of circumstances) and probably spiraling into a panic attack. That sort of behavior in kids, when they\u2019ve exhausted their options and there is no way out but they cannot get a handle on their emotions\u2014 it reminds me of an animal caught in a trap, yknow? Biting and clawing and acting out because what else can they do? \n\nUnderstandable reaction for a fifth-grader to have while being put in handcuffs, in my opinion. I was thirteen when I had my first real encounter with cops (I skipped school and they picked me up and brought me back and yelled at me) and that is probably the most afraid I had ever been at that point in my life. And they didn\u2019t even cuff me! I can only imagine the fear that girl was feeling, so while I do blame her for getting herself into this situation to begin with, I don\u2019t really blame her fully for freaking out. \n\nI don\u2019t know why this turned into an essay \ud83d\ude2d Tldr expecting an adult level of emotional regulation in a juvenile brain is not realistic.
