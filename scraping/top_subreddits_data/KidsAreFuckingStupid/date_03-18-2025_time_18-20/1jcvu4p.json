Blindfold someone and ask them to taste-test different soda brands, but make one cup chocolate milk. Even if they love chocolate milk and it's a really nice cup, the initial reaction will be disgust because they're expecting something totally different. Dye candies different colors, and people will report preferring the raspberry or the grape, even if they're all the same flavor. People like Vegemite a lot more if you tell them to imagine soy sauce for a few seconds first, even if they already know it's strong and salty and not like the Nutella or peanut butter it resembles. Texture too, imagine sipping from a milk bottle but getting yogurt. And presentation, like bottles vs cans.\n\nKids don't have much experience with food so when you're introducing them to something, they're going in apprehensive and often with completely the wrong expectation of the taste and texture. Boiled green beans kinda look like carrot sticks, go to eat one expecting something like carrot, but suddenly it's all mushy and squirting water in your mouth, and it's unexpected and weird and doesn't match what seems right for something looking like that. It can make things feel gross.\n\nIf you serve them the same food again with the same name, they resent it because you're serving them something they already told you they hated. But if you change the name, they'll often like it, because now it's a new food but they don't have the same expectations they did the first time. Now they know that food like that might be mushy, that some foods squirt when bitten into, etc.\n\nIt really helps a lot of kids to try and demonstrate or explain the food before they eat it. Like eating a piece yourself and showing whether it's crunchy, chewy, or crumbly, or mashing a bit up with your fork to show how soft it is and what texture it has.",

I threw up on the table. Didn't try that one again lol. Still don't like fish at all, but my aversion is not as severe anymore, I can eat a pizza with some tuna, or freshly caught fried perch, but I still don't prefer it.",
