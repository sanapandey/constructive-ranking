Gemma3 and a drawn-up UI (or something like Open WebUI) in that environment will replace ChatGPT for an enterprising person (for most tiny to mild use-cases; maybe not so much tasks necessitating moderate and above compute).\n\nThe industry needs a lot more of it and a lot less of the 3Bs and 8Bs just because Meta's Llama was doing it (or at least, that's what it seems like to me; arbitrary).",

Certainly holistically right-sizing the models for constrained capacity edge / consumer use cases is important for UX / usability / capability in the constrained environment.\n\nBut technology is also shifting at the leading edge of the 'edge' and particularly consumer PC space.  It's uncommon to find serious consumer laptop / desktop platforms without DDR5 now and the sanely built ones will have that in dual channel without too bad of a CPU / RAM performance build.\n\nSo 8B, 9B models, even 12, 14, 16B are small enough that they're usefully able to run in many cases even at Q8 on such a CPU+RAM system (modern laptop or better kind of scenario).  When you find a Q4 model adequate then certainly those sizes and maybe borderline even 32B Q4 is \"usable\" for text-to-text LLM without a lot of reasoning and small contexts on CPU alone.\n\nSo with even a 8GBy VRAM DGPU one has even significantly less model size to offload (if any) to system RAM and at that point I'm not sure it hugely matters if the model is 9B, 14B, 16B, 24B since between a low-mid-range 8GBy DGPU and your system CPU/RAM it'll work OK except long context and brutally slow reasoning model cases, video / image models etc.",

                                                    "body": "That's interesting, thanks. I wasn't aware of the DDR5 error prone issue on non pro-sumer platforms.  I've been sad about the 'race to the bottom' quality and UX of consumer PCs for quite a few years in terms of various quality / architecture / mechanical etc. things so I guess I'm not surprised, but disappointed.  In a more sane world they'd just have standardized on 'server' DIMM type RAM and RAM with ECC for SMB / enthusiast / beyond casual gamer / home productivity & server etc. platforms if not all desktop platforms beyond bottom of the barrel entry level stuff.  Having multiple DIMM standards with pretty minor electrical / architecture standard differences and very modest cost differences but having much more quality & reliability doesn't seem too sane when giving up reliability / scalability (why even have a desktop computer if you don't want those things).  And then the economy of volume would have just made good ECC DIMMS less costly and more available for all use cases both SMB / consumer and commodity server.\n\nSo yeah it's not worth it to me to trade off bad RAM and a crippled machine (expandability, reliability, quality, speed) for a one time savings of $20 or $100 or whatever silly difference there could be.\n\nAnd especially having more than 128 bit wide ram and having 4+ DIMMs all able to run at full speed is long overdue, but I guess we're finally getting some (reportedly) better options there for consumer / SMB desktops in 2026.\n\nYes I think it could / will be that APU / IGPU / NPU in any mix can be very satisfactory for many use cases of 'GPGPU' / HPC / AIML inference as long as the unit's got decent capability vs. data type (1.58...16 bit binary / float / int) and there's enough RAM BW to at least compete with a $300-$500ish DGPU such as has existed for several generations now (2060, ...).\n\nI agree the higher quants with lower model sizes is good in many ways.  Mostly I care about coding and STEM and other things where I value accuracy and complexity so having a good enough model + representation to deliver the quality that's there is what I'd idealize.\n\nWhen creating models I'm sure they can trade-off bits for bits pretty much any way they want to whether ternary or 4 bit int/float data types or 8, 16, 32 bit ones, information theory says a bit is a bit in terms of what you can store there informationally as long as you actually map your information / data to the representation and make full use of its capability.  Certainly one could hope for some low cost NPU/TPU type products using ternary or 4-bit data types at high speeds with lots of such weights sufficient to encode the model information we just need more models trained / optimized for such and then the HW to inference that which should be in ALU/FPU/compute sense much less complex / costly than the current DGPUs which have to support FP32 and all the way down to INT4/FP4 because of the varied use cases and no pervasive switch to 4bit or lower model architectures.\n\nAs far as TPS and speed etc. yeah we need to maintain that as models get more complex in use case and capability.  text-to-text interactive chat LLMs are 'easy' in that they can be slow and some use cases don't even need much context size.  But there's lots of applications where one wants to process large documents, images, video, etc. where one actually pushes a lot of data into / through the model and even for consumer personal use cases like translation / summarization / RAG / search etc. one wants to be able to handle lots of report / ebook / web page / article sized inputs fast enough to be interactive or at least keep up with newly added things by the dozen interactively.\n\nIMO the \"main system\" has to become relevant / primary again in terms of its compute capacity, RAM size, RAM BW otherwise it's not much of a \"main computer\" and you're paying for CPU/RAM you barely can/do use while paying redundantly for a bunch of VRAM and a DGPU full of CPU/FPU/NPU/TPU to do much of your actual 'work' in accelerated compute for AIML, graphics, data analysis, etc.  So yeah if one is going to give up and delegate entire categories of use case to a special accelerator hopefully a low cost high performance NPU over an eye wateringly expensive DGPU that doesn't well fit physically and architecturally as a peripheral to a PC any more.\n\nWe've also fallen off the cliff in terms of composable systems given the lack of high BW networking and low cost availability of it.  I could also see \"pods\" or \"bricks\" of compute / storage / accelerator etc. becoming a thing like \"appliances\" where you \"lego\" them into a composite system expanding organically / incrementally over time as need arises and not losing capacity but simply gaining it into the composite machine until some piece breaks or becomes SO obsolete that it's uneconomical to use that piece in which case one doesn't lose the rest of the system's function and one can replace anything without too much pain.\n\nCertainly IMO we need to get there for storage where now most people either are using the 'cloud' for backup / primary storage or they likely don't even have good fault tolerance / backup, and probably no good migration / scalability story.\n\nBut it can be compute, too, and that'd make some sense for minimizing e-waste and having \"use it a few years then throw it away\" do it all expensive PCs as opposed to just networks of devices that can aggregate / distribute load and resources.  The SW isn't too far from being able to handle that nicely, but the way PCs / SMB & consumer 'servers' are built / packaged needs to evolve IMO.",
