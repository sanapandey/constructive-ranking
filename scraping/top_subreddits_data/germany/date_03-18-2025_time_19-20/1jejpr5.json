    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m applying for the EU Blue Card in Germany, and I have a question about the housing requirements. I currently live in a WG (shared apartment) with a private single room and a shared bathroom. My rent is around 430\u20ac per month.\n\nDoes the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde accept a rental contract for a WG with a low rent like this? Or do they require a separate/private apartment?\n\nWould appreciate any insights or experiences! Thanks!",
