I would definitely say your level of German needs to be relatively high to use it. It also has bugs/small irritations that have never been fixed. That might be mac only. I also recommend not saving the files you are working on in the cloud. It somehow has trouble saving/auto saving when the file isn\u2019t local. Bug downside is that they used to have excellent telephone support and now they\u2019ve replaced that with the most useless and annoying AI bot. Absolutely terrible. I recently had a problem where it made no sense to open a ticket. Something that literally could be solved in a two minute call. That\u2019s how long it took btw with an operator, however there were 20 minutes of fucking around with a bot before hand.",

Although if your German is not good and the app has a professionally translated English version, that would be a solid reason to use it.\n\nPeople always say that these apps give you \"hints\" where you could save taxes, but when I was still using them, I never got anything useful out of them.",
