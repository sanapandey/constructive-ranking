    "selftext": "My friend lives with her partner, who has issues drinking too much. For the past two weeks, he has been awake every night, drinking, waking her up and yelling at her to go get more alcohol for him, throwing her out of the bedroom, making her sleep on the floor, etc. She went to a hotel room that she had to put on her credit card so she could get some sleep so she wouldn't be fired from her job. Is this illegal? Could she pursue legal action against her partner?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the input, everyone. I managed to personally secure her a temporary flat through an agency for about 6 weeks that I've paid in full while she looks for new accommodation. She's leaving him, and has called the police. She's safe for now, and I truly hope she never goes back to this waste of human tissue. ",

The TB for K\u00f6rperverletzung, so doing harm to someone else doesn't cover psychological abuse. The german courts only vount \"vis absoluta\" so physical force under that law. You could prosecute it as \"Beleidigung\" \u00a7 185 StGB. The problem there is, what exactly was your goal in that situation? If you needed a place to stay, that's an entirely different question and not something that the law would help you with. Prosecuting someone isn't always all that helpful, since it takes a long time to get a court hearing.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you were feeling threatened or he was trying to make you do something, those can both be prosecuted under seperate criminal laws. That's probably what the cop meant when he said \"unless he threatens to kill you\". That's not actuall, true, it's sufficient if he threatens to do anything you see as harmful. It's called \"empfindliches \u00dcbel\".\u00a0\n\n\nSo, abuse and it's forms, psychological abuse also, is very much illegal in Germany",
