    "selftext": "So, I've given notice on my flat to move out and just received an email from the landlord (a company) who ask me to either:\n- provide a contact number or email for prospective tenants to directly contact me for a viewing, or\n- give them a time (~1 hr) to arrange appointments for viewing, but outside working hours and they will not be present, i.e. presumably I am supposed to act as their agent and manage it all when people show up.\n\nIt seems a bit strange to me and also their job, not mine.\n\nI am totally opposed to the first option because a) the difficulty in not being a native speaker and b) not my job to be called or have to reply to emails to arrange viewings on the landlords behalf.\n\nAs to the 2nd, I have no problem providing a suitable time for them but I feel they should have a representative present to manage the appointment attendance. There are too many ways this could come back on me otherwise, not least is someone coming late and I'm not there (so no answer to the bell) or someone coming late and it's no longer in the specified time and I tell them to naff off, they complain and I cop the fallout.\n\nCan I write back to them and say of course xxx time/date will be suitable but they must have someone in attendance to manage it? Advice please?\n\nEdit: the relevant part of the email states:\nSie nennen uns einen festen Sammelbesichtigungstermin (Dauer ca. 1 Stunde). Wir w\u00fcrden dann die Interessenten getakted im 10 Minutentakt einladen. Der Termin sollte so liegen, dass berufst\u00e4tige an diesem Termin teilnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Sprich der Termin sollte morgens von 8.00 bis 9.00 Uhr oder ab 17.00 Uhr stattfinden. An diesem Termin wird keiner aus unserem Hause mit vor Ort sein. Sofern wir beim ersten Besichtigungstermin keinen passenden Mietinteressenten finden, w\u00fcrde wir nochmals wegen einem zweiten Termin auf Sie zukommen.",

Remind him that you do not speak German and you would need someone from the landlord side to represent him out of security reasons. \n\nI strongly assume that either the landlord OR someone from his side is being present anyway. Unless we are talking about you trying out of the contract earlier and the landlord is trying to find a successor, which is usually your role in this case.",

I would agree to 2. but simply not act as an agent (you are not obligated to do so).\n\n\nJust let the people in who have an arranged appointment (make clear that you want to know in advance who will show up, i.e. not just an \"open house\" for anyone). Then oversee them to make sure that they don't steal anything (or the like), which you would do anyway, I assume, even if a landlord agent were present too. And if they ask questions, just be friendly and decline to answer (or if you can and feel like it, e.g. if they are friendly too and ask in English, maybe even answer). Simply restrict yourself to things that you would likely do anyway, even if a landlord agent were present. No need to \"act as an agent\".\n\n\nIt builds up a good relationship with the landlord that you may profit from if there later are some problems to solve when you move out (that's not a guarantee, but it can't hurt).",

Without a person authorised by the landlord, you cannot allow interested tenants into your flat due to security concerns, for example.",

Providing a time is fine for me and I would still be there, but one issue for me is, if they have someone there and their scheduled appointment doesn't arrive, there is no issue. If the agent leaves and the viewer comes later, there's no problem (because the agent knows they didn't arrive when agreed). If they have nobody there and the viewer comes later, and makes a complaint because I'm no longer there, then it becomes my problem and it should not.",
