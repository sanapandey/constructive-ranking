    "selftext": "Okay so, a Journalist asked me to join a interview or a video series (I don\u2019t know since they didn\u2019t give me much details yet) about military - I am interested in military and they want someone who wants a career in the military (wich I want) and I thought about doing it but im not so sure. The person seems to be an actual journalist from RTL (due to her social media where the official RTL journalist\u2019s account follows her back) but im not sure if it could be a scam or not. She asked me over my TikTok account since she saw a few of my comments under a few TikTok\u2019s from the german military, wich is kinda suspect for me because why would u just hit up a random girl from the comment section? It is weird for me, I\u2019m only a teenager and got hit up by a journalist (as it seems) already and I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I asked her to give me more information about the content they would make but theres no answer yet. I honestly don\u2019t know if I should do it since it could ruin my future, if they post clips without context or make me seem having a weird opinion it could be picked up wrong and my future company where I work could use that against me.\n\nWhat do I do? Is RTL trustworthy with military stuff or such kinds of things? I barely watch it.",

RTL made headlines with giving TV contracts to a prominent covid denier nutcase and his at the time barely-of-age wife for a show. You don't want your name anywhere near it.",

I once left a comment on a news website defending a well-known British comedian, and the actual comedian tracked me down on (what was at the time) Twitter just to say thanks. Sometimes random comments get read and are appreciated.\n\n> I asked her to give me more information about the content they would make but theres no answer yet.\n\nIf it's genuine, she'll answer your questions. If you're a minor, she'll need the consent of a parent or legal guardian.\n\n> it could ruin my future, if they post clips without context or make me seem having a weird opinion\n\nFor sure. So if you're not 100% certain about this, you can always say \"No.\"",
