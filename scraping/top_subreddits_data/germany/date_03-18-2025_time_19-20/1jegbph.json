    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm currently searching for an advice and answers to questions I have about the situation I am in. \nSince I moved out to Germany I've been working in a well known brand hotel - year in housekeeping and 7 months now as housekeeping supervisor. Though the intermediary company that employs me have some ways of functioning that strikes me an odd.\nThe contract I signed very clearly states I'm earning 13,95\u20ac per hour, yet as a cleaner I was being paid per amount of rooms done one day (e.g. we have as standard set 30min to clean one room so hourly wage = two rooms cleaned). If you spent longer working on your rooms and done overhours that time was never paid in any form.\nI got then promoted to being a supervisor and started to get paid normally for the hours I was doing, but heres where comes the fun part. \nFebruary is not the most occupied month in the hotel industry so I was getting some extra free days, I thought that was normal way of going down of the overhours we're making and that's still 100% paid time since me and my colleagues work on average at least 10h daily. This month my salary came short of 300\u20ac to what I was normally earning. I asked my manager about it, and turns out we're still not getting any overhours paid in any way. \n So heres some questions I have:\n- If you had a job in housekeeping, how was your company paying for your work? Is it normal to always get paid for the amount of rooms done, or does some places actually pay per hour no matter how many rooms you service?\n- Can my employer provide me less working hours monthly than we actually agreed for on contract? My fianc\u00e9 told me if there is not enough work for all the employees these months normally some of them could have be sent on kurzarbeit.\n- Is it legal and allowed at all, to not pay the overhours in any way to your employees? Are there any legal steps I can take?\nThank you in advance for all the words and informations on this subject. ",

But the issue for you, if I understand correctly, is that even though you worked more than 8 hours, you were only paid for working 8 hours? Or was it that they paid you for the full number of hours that you worked but the extra hours in a given day were not treated as overtime (which is often compensated at a higher rate than standard hours)?",

During the exam, I used to take break or work less than minijib hours.. But got paid for minijob.. We used to keep the datasheet and compensate accordingly.",
