You only pay half the fare.\n\nDogs not traveling in a carrier must be on a leash and muzzled.\n\nGuide dogs and designated assistance dogs always travel free of charge and are not required to wear a muzzle on the train.\"",

(S-Bahn/ Re) you can\u2019t use IC and ICE with the deutschlandticket anyways.\n\nOutside of NRW you have to get a ticket for your dog tho. It is usually half the price of the normal ride. Sadly you can\u2019t get a Deutschlandticket for pets.\n\nIt is really annoying for me as well, I have to take the train between Regensburg and N\u00fcrnberg regularly.\nI can take the train as often as I want for 58\u20ac/ month and I have to pay 20\u20ac (40\u20ac with return) every single time for my dog. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nI never used a muzzle tho, no one ever said anything, but they do check if I have a ticket for my dog every time.",

I haven\u2019t had a dog here since moving, but I see muzzles used so often. On the one hand I get it because of the liability, but I\u2019ve never seen a moderately trained dog bite anyone. Never needed one personally.",

It\u2019s like a strap going around her jaw but I never put it on. I just carry it incase someone says anything. So far no one ever did.\n\nLuckily I live in NRW and I\u2019m in Bavaria like twice a month. I always book ice (supersparpreis) in advance. it is manageable and not too expensive. I just googled and in Berlin / brandenburg dogs are also free.\n\nYou can check my profile and see some pictures of her if interested \u270c\ud83c\udffb",
