    "selftext": "Hi friends! Im curious how feasible is it to visit Bodensee for a day trip and whether it would be better to stay there for a night. I\u2019m living in Munich. \n\nIt seems like there\u2019s a lot of places to go like Friedrichshafen, Konstanz, Lindau and Reichenau. I did my research and Konstanz is at the border so I can check that out, and Friedrichshafen has a cool viewing platform, Lindau has a lighthouse. Should I go to all of these places? I want to check out the border  and take a boat ride. \n\n\nThanks!! ",
