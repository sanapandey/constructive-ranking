    "selftext": "Servus! Been thinking a lot about my grandma who died in 2003 when I was 4 but my dad never really talked about her because he lost himself when she died of colon cancer. I know that she worked in chocolate factory in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr. I found this recognition for her work in my dads house but I wonder which chocolate factory was that. My mom said it was big factory back in 90's. I'd be very grateful if someone helps me. I hope they have some kind of photos of her or old archives that I can read or see.Since I had my daughter,I cant stop thinking about her and wondering how was she with her friends and colleags. Danke!",

As a way to soften the image blow and to help appease the conscience of those that profited directly. \n\nMy grandparents/great-grandparents were pretty rich farmers back then. Not as big as the noble landowners but industrial machinery big. They absolutely used forced labour. My grandma has always justified this with \"We fed them well and saved them from death\". They don't see themselves as bad people but more akin to saviors like Oskar Schindler (not comparable and I doubt my grandmother knows who he was). Ironically part of the family ended up in a former nazi labour camp. Just now under soviet management. So in their minds they were the victims of the soviets while under Nazi rule everything was great.",

When there are no such letters it speaks volumes.\n\nBut for small companies and farms would I be generally careful when they used forced labour: they lost all/most of their workers (most germans got sent to war). At the same time were companies pressured by nazis to keep up production/produce war time goods/food etc. As replacement for their germans workers was the SS sending forced laborers. You still had to pay \"rent\" for them to the SS (which wasn't necessarily cheaper than regular wages). Many smaller companies weren't happy about this \"deal\" and would have prefered to keep their usual workers.\n\nThis does not apply to big companies, which negotiated terms and conditions with the SS. Many of these bigger companies profited heavily because of cheap forced labour. \n\nMany farmers around 1900 were also known to treat even their regular workers terrible (see working and living conditions of \"knecht/magd\"). So you really need to look into the details of each individual case. But rule of thumb: big players profited heavily and treated forced laborers terrible. And if a small business/farm had sudden growth during WW2 this also speaks volumes.",
