Normal where I grew up on the east coast of the US too, but when most Germans say these comments, they seem to expect to be taken seriously. An example of this was the other day, a customer was being demanding, and the cashier said something along the lines of, yeah I don\u2019t have three arms, I can\u2019t do it all at once. I laughed to myself thinking basically, good one! But everyone else just seemed totally blank and had no real reaction.

                    "body": ">But it is, by definition, rudeness.\n\nIt is not. Rudeness is only defined in the context of a certain culture. For a simple example: Tipping is expected in American culture, and not doing so (or even tipping \"too little\") is considered very rude. In Japan on the other hand you do not tip, and doing so would be interpreted along the lines of \"You must be poor since you're doing such a bad job, so here's some pity money\". Doing the same thing can be either the bare minimum of politeness or incredibly rude depending on the culture.\n\nGerman culture simply does not view it as inherently polite to sugarcoat negative feedback as much as possible. If someone does something wrong, the polite thing here is to tell them so plainly. Of course, don't get insulting or personal (\"As always, you're doing a shit job because you're stupid\" is rude in Germany too), but don't start off with \"You're doing such a great job\" if what you actually want to say is that they're making a mistake.\n\nI'd go as far as saying that this sugarcoating may be regarded as impolite.  \nFrom personal experience, I'm currently taking a language course in a country that clearly has less of a culture of bluntness than Germany. When somebody gives a presentation in the course, we're supposed to give two positive items of feedback and one \"constructive\" item of feedback. This is obviously meant to be polite (because \"constructive\" is less direct than \"negative\" or whatever), but it comes across as extremely passive aggressive to my German mind - are we so bad at the language that there's nothing positive to say that's constructive too?",
