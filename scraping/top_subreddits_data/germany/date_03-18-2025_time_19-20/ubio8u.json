Please use these resources. If you post questions that are easily answered, our regulars will point you to those resources anyway. Additionally, please use the **Reddit search**. [Edit: Don't claim you read the Wiki and it does not contain anything about your question when it's clear that you didn't read it. We know what's in the Wiki, and we will continue to point you there.]\n\nThis goes particularly if you are asking about **studying in Germany**. There are multiple Wiki articles covering a lot of information. And yes, that means reading and doing your own research. It's good practice for what a German university will expect you to do.\n\n**Short questions** can be asked in the comments to this post. Please either leave a comment here or make a new post, not both.\n\n**If you ask questions in the subreddit, please provide enough information for people to be able to actually help you.** \"Can I find a job in Germany?\" will not give you useful answers. \"I have [qualification], [years of experience], [language skills], want to work as [job description], and am a citizen of [country]\" will. If people ask for more information, they're not being mean, but rather trying to find out what you actually need to know.\n\n----------------\n\n**German-language content** can go to **/r/de** or **/r/FragReddit**.\n\nQuestions **about the German language** are better suited to **/r/German**.\n\n**Covid-related content** should go into **[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/r7ui9b/megathread_corona_rules_vaccination_questions_etc/)** until further notice.\n\n**/r/LegaladviceGerman/** has limited **legal advice** - but make sure to read their disclaimers.",

My visa expired in March, but there was no earlier appointment date for the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde available than the one in the end of June, which was allocated to me back when I arrived last year. All cool at that moment, as I was informed that I am perfectly legal in Germany as I am awaiting my appointment, although my visa expired. Two weeks before the appointment I receive mail (yeah physical mail) that all appointments were cancelled and that we should send our documents by email, with no specified date. I sent all my documents a few days after my cancelled appointment was due (maybe that is a problem?). A few weeks later (a day or two ago) I received the Ausreiseaufforderung.\n\nI guess that the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde is in utter chaos and that they probably haven't even started processing my documents, or even if they have that they are not synchronized and that they still send me the notice to leave Germany, although I have sent them my documents. Can anyone say in how big of a problem I am and how much will all that last and cost? I will try to contact the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde as soon as possible, but they were unreachable in the past either by phone or by mail, so I'm not optimistic about that. I already googled some lawyers in my city, that are doing immigration law and will try to tell them my issues and possibly make an appointment. Is there anything else I should do, and what is the ballpark of the prices of lawyers in such simpler cases? I clearly do not want to lose any money due to the inefficient bureaucracy here, but is seems I will have to.",

However, I since received an email saying that the journey is not possible anymore due to a time change (departure time shifted 2 hours earlier), which I am unable to make due to itinerary plans.\n\nHave a couple questions:\n\n1. Can I confirm that I am able to use my existing ticket for (ICE 1171) for any other train rides for the day? And I just have to scan my existing ticket at whichever train ride I decide to board, without the need to re-book anything?\n2. Understand that a seat reservation is a separate add-on altogether from the train ticket. If I were to take a train journey with a different train number from my original booking, will I have to then purchase a separate seat reservation for the new journey?\n\nThanks in advance!",

My question relates to the language learner visa (not the university student visa) - if I arrive on the language learner visa, would it then switch automatically to the typically 3 month Schengen visa once expired? (I'm Australian, so the '3 month Schengen period' is the automatic rule for me whenever I've visited previously).\n\nI'm assuming any language learning course that's exactly 3 months or less wouldn't let me get a language visa (as it'd fit into the normal visiting timeframe), so am trying to work out the mechanics to make the most of my time.\n\nCurrent ponderings are:\n\n* If I arrive on a 3 month + language visa, does this switches to the tourist visa automatically? Or do I have to leave Schengen and then return?\n* If I arrive on the normal 'tourist visa' prior to the course starting - does this switch to the language visa once the date for this begins? If so, does it then resume once the course finishes? (Presuming it'd go into the overall '180 day Schengen zone rule' somehow)\n\nI'll ask the local embassy as well, but never hurts for some extra guidance in case anyone here has some insight. Any knowledge is greatly appreciated, thankyou!",

However, the city itself is a financial/business city that lacks the charm of other German cities; although the Christmas market is quite nice. \n\nIf you are in fly into Frankfurt some nearby cities with good Christmas markets would be:\n\n\\- Mainz & Wiesbaden. Capital cities on either side of the Rhein river. Mainz is more fun, Wiesbaden more beautiful.  \n\\- R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein. Cute town in wine region, known for their Christmas markets. Lovely but a bit small & can be very touristy in the Winter. \n\nOther places I'd recommend:  \n\\-Dresden. Personal favorite in Germany. Gorgeous city with a top notch Christmas market. Flights direct are quite expensive; might be best to fly into Berlin and take a train.  \n\\- Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Town with really cool medieval architecture. One of the few remaining \"walled\" cities. Touristy for sure but super awesome & definitely goes big during Christmas season. Not far from N\u00fcrnberg so you could check out both.   \n\\-Ravennaschlucht. One of the coolest markets. They setup the markets and lights in a valley/gorge under a viaduct. Very picturesque. Recommend planning in advance. Have to take a shuttle bus there from a nearby town as parking is limited. The village of Titisee is nearby, has a pretty lake, and popular with Germans. Downside is this area is pretty far from any major airports.  \n\n\nIf you're willing to travel a bit more, Strasbourg in Alsace region of France (plus neighboring Colmar) is probably my favorite Christmas market in Europe. Plus the food there is amazing. Just be warned hotel prices skyrocket around Christmas season, and restaurants book well in advance. \n\nGood luck and enjoy your travels!",

After that, the insurance covers the entire sum without a co-pay.\n\nThe total co-pays per year are also capped: At most, you pay 2 percent of your gross income each year (or 1 percent if you are chronically ill).\n\nThe way German public insurance is set up, you will not get into a situation where you lose coverage when you need particularly much of it.",

I haven't seen my parents since the start of the pandemic and they are coming to visit me in Germany the middle of July.\n\nIn that time, I bought some sex toys, lots of Pride decorations, and some of books that my parents might not be very pleased about (to be more precise, I have some gay novels in German and in English, I have some books by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Anton LaVey, and the ones by Anton LaVey in particular are a very rare hardcover print that I got from Ebay, and they are kinda irreplaceable to me).\n\nAnyone got an idea of what i can do? Are there any public safety boxes I can rent to store these things in? (not sure what they are called in German or English, but this concept exists in my country), and I am not talking about the ones in a bank. I am just talking about storage. Doesn't have to be something too secure. The items are not worth much money; they have a more sentimental value for me (especially the decorations) \n\nThe sex toys I can always dispose of and buy again, but some of the decorations are hand made and not something I can just buy from Amazon, and I don't want to throw away my books. Plus I would rather not waste stuff and hurt the environment, so throwing away stuff is the last option.\n\nMy parents will stay here for 14 days.\n\nI love my parents very much and I don't want to shock them. My sister and I are working on subtly making them more open-minded through hints and debates so I can come out to them some time in the future when they are fully accepting of LGBTQ+ people. We are making a lot of progress but they are still not ready, and this is definitely not how I want them to find out (fetishy sex toys is the last thing I want them to associate my sexuality with, lol)",

It's also extremely worrisome that she's not attending school.\n\nI assume that the hospital has no idea the girl grows up without family support - maybe they saw the grandma and simply thought she is a full time caretaker and didn't escalate the matter any further.\n\nThat said, I'm not too sure how involved the hospital in itself generally is; but there absolutely is a social service that they could have involved (\"Sozialdienst des Krankenhauses\", literally: Social Service of the Hospital), as well as youth protection services (\"Jugendamt\").\n\nIf you want to help, I'd suggest to google Jugendamt + city name and give them a call, explain the situation, and let them follow through.\n\nThe school is also partially to blame here, when a kid is missing school without any doctor's note (parental note can only be issued for up to 3 days I think, but don't quote me on that) they are supposed to contact the parent(s), and failing to reach them, actually send a police unit over to investigate. Now this might have happened during the Easter break, but school has since resumed and they are definitely neglectful, to say the very least.",

Can I still apply for the exams and the transcript of records even if I don't registered? Is the Anmeldung mandatory to validate my erasmus? \n\nMy university says that thanks to my EU origin, I don't need a permit of living so for them they don't care (but I do ahah) \n\nDoes someone was in my situation before? Can I just avoid this paper and study until the end? \n\nThank you a lot for your response!",

It's not common, but perfectly possible.\n\nThat said, the university doesn't care about your registered address, whether you are from the EU or not. They only care about having a valid mailing address on file - anything goes, really. Plenty of students live with friends and family first before having an official registered address, so you don't have any issues in that regard.\n\nApplicable German law however dictates that you must be registered within 2 weeks of moving into a place where you intend to stay >2 months. A small caveat here is that appointments for the actual registration are booked out months ahead, and as long as you book the nearest available one, you are good to go. So if you were to only find an appointment 4 months into the future... When you are already supposed to move back......\n\nI think you know where I'm going :)",

The toilet in the apartment is broken, not that it doesn't work, but more like it looks like it's going to fall off anytime soon. It needs repair as soon as possible. What's more concerning is that my roommate informed me that this problem has been ongoing since they moved in, and they had repeatedly emailed the landlord about the broken toilet, requesting maintenance. Six months ago, they responded and said they will send someone to check, but no one showed up even until now. I am about to move in in a few days, and I'm left worried when it will break and when it breaks I have no idea how I am going to the toilet.\n\nAdding to my frustration, the previous tenant, who moved out before me, reached out to the landlord to request their deposit back. Shockingly, they were informed that the cost of fixing the bathroom, including the toilet, would be deducted from their deposit. However, from what I gather, the toilet was already faulty before they even moved in. Now that makes me worried that they will not refund my deposit when I move out and blame the damages on me. I'm at a loss as to what steps I can take to address these issues. Is there any way I can file a formal complaint against the landlord or the property management company for neglecting maintenance responsibilities? And if so, who should I reach out to for assistance? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.",

So maybe check whether your accomodation has some kind of charger, and rent a ev that can charge relatively fast or has a large battery pack, otherwise you might have to stop and wait half an hour to an hour to recharge.

I only know basic small words in German and I've gotten by OK so far asking if others know some English and trying to use my phone to translate written German words. \n\nI went into a restaurant, not luxury, just a trendy burger place. I asked if the staff spoke a little English so I could dine there. The employee said no problem and gave me an English menu. Great! However he left and I was wondering if there is a certain time that it takes? \n\nI sat there for 20 minutes and thought maybe I am just being too American expecting fast service, but I had plans to go to the museum and at that point I wasn't sure how long it would take. So I got up and left, the same employee saw me leaving and didn't say anything, I didn't say anything either. Is this because they didn't want to deal with an English speaker? Or is it typical to not be asked for drink/food order for over 20 minutes?",

I am a visiting germany for 5 months for a semester exchange. yesterday I got the letter asking me to pay the !Rundfundbeitrag.\n\nwhile I was at the bank I asked if I could pay it here and showed them the letter they said that I shouldn't be paying the fee because I am staying for 5 months and only If I had a longer stay (staying for 5 years or more ) should I have to pay it.\n\nThey helped me out and filled out the form (even though I didn't ask) for me and said that I should get a call later ( I signed the form and left my phone number)\nThey even mailed the letter.\n\nI am really glad that they helped me out . They were super nice, and I will NEVER FORGET THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.\n\nThe problem is I tried checking the wiki , the FAQ and some previous posts and everything pointed to me having to pay the fee plus it's only 18-ish euros a month so I don't really care that much but the bank filled the form for me and I thought it would have been rude to say no.\n\nI also have a written contract with my landlord that I should be paying the fee.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. on average, when should I expect the call because I don't want the fee to accumulate?\n\n2. what is the best thing to do right now (this sums it up)?\n\n3. For how long can I wait for the call before \nAdditional fees.\n\nAny other questions I should ask directly during the call, and I don't need them answered\n\nBut they are:\n\n4. I am still thinking about it ,but I can also take the next 2 semesters in germany. If I come back to germany after 1 or 2 months. is it considered the same \"stay\"?\n\n5. If I am not paying the fee, then is it cancelled, or is it re-directed to my landlord cause I don't want to be causing her trouble\n\nSorry for the long post.\n\n\nMore information: \nI am from Egypt, enrolled in the German University in Cairo, which has a campus in berlin studying in English.\n\nI am 20. This is the end of my 3rd year in university the 6th semester. I can choose to take the 7th, 8th semesters in berlin, but the 9th and 10th have to be in Cairo.\n\nThanks again, and I hope you are going to have a good night.",

However, I am confused about \u201cfare zones\u201d does that mean you can only go from A to B and not return from B to A? Would I need a second pass to do this? Our stop on the way home is not the same stop we leave from. I am also toting two children with me. I was hoping for a weekly or monthly pass but this doesn\u2019t look likely.

You will arrive on a remote stand from Berlin, bus to gate can take 15 minutes at Frankfurt, then you arrive in terminal and need to go to non Schengen zone to fly to London, which means passing exit passport control. Then your London flight will board super early (bus gate again) so you pretty much have 30 minutes from your Berlin flight going on stand, getting to terminal, finding area for second flight, clearning Schengen exit check and then going to your gate for your London flight boarding. An an airport where running is common pastime. Of course if you fly with Lufty, and don't mind waiting, they will put you on the next flight. \n\nI was there a few months ago and Schengen - Schengen even involved 20 minutes non-stop walking between our gates, we had a nice buffer. That's tight to say the least with 60 minutes and the Schengen to non Schengen connection. I have heard there is a Schengen passport booth somewhere on the actual tarmac somewhere for emergency cases, but no idea what level of late you need to be to use it. \n\nPS there are no exit customs checks in Germany, only exit immigration if you are flying outside Schengen. You will pass UK customs on arrival, so I guess what you are really asking is if you can get your VAT refund in BER or FRA, possibly there is something in the non Schengen area but you would be better checking with both airports in advance, surely that's an FAQ.",

            "body": "I have to tell you a short story for you to understand the question. Forgive me I will make it as short as I can. I was in the US Army Military Police. I was a criminal investigator. In 1983 or 84 a military housing area called Patton Village in Kornwestheim near Stuttgart had two children murder their parents. The father was in the Army but none of the other people involved were. They lived on a US Army housing area but it was open. Anybody could walk onto or through the area. The military had no authority to prosecute civilians with crimes. We could get them kicked out of the country but that was about it. The two boys, after killing their parents, stole a camping vehicle and fled the area. They were both to young to drive and were noticed in a few days and apprehended by the Polizi. They were held in a jail in Stuttgart. I helped process the crime scene, a ghastly sight and smell I can assure you. Today all these years later I have a YouTube channel where I tell stories of my past. I don't tell stories that I can not prove, in case somebody wants to sue me. I do not recall the names of anybody involved in the crime only the approximate year and location.\n\nMy questions are;\n\nCan I get public records of crimes the two boys did?\n\nIf I can get such records, where would I ask for them and how would I ask for them?\n\nCan anybody point me to the rules for such requests?\n\nAny answer at all is more than I know now, which is nothing. Thank you.",

The most you might be able to find would be local newspaper reports from the time - and those too would be anonymised and quite limited.",

Did not give me any specifics, just said if you get a work contract you get a work permit.\n\nI obtained a work contract at a private school for 25 hours a week. When I contacted my lawyer again, he said that it will not work, I do not have enough hours. Then when I asked how many hours I needed, he said it did not matter about the hours, I just would not be paid enough in order to apply. Then I asked what is the minimum amount I need to make in order to apply. He then said it does not matter how much I make, but it is about the hours I work.\n\nCould someone please help me with this confusion? I have consulted the online Make It In Germany website numerous times and I have never read this. And I was told to just obtain a work contract and then I can apply from there.\n\n  \nAny advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

So naturally I chose the second option, but now according to what I've been reading this is absolutely irreversible, which means I can't ever get publicly insured.\n\nWhich apparently also limits my working opportunities since I had applied to work at an Amazon depot but I was told I needed to be publicly insured, and mainly I am just worried about the time after my studies when I start working and finally become a citizen. So my main question is: will I be able to get into German public insurance later?",

Currently you can book a ticket for an EC train that takes 1:50 for 18 \u20ac. But i guess if you want the Deutschlandticket anyway for getting around at your destination it makes sense. Paying for the Deutschlandticket for two months will be cheaper than getting seperate tickets for every journey plus tickets for public transport at your destination. Also the ticketing system for public transport in Munich is infamous for confusing even Germans. On a completely different note, are you aware what traveling on christmas means in Germany? Everything will be closed from the afternoon on the 24th until the 27th, restaurants are either closed or booked weeks in advance, and people will spend their time at home with their families. Christmas markets usually close around the 21st. Similar story around new years eve and new years day. Probably the worst time for sightseeing. If you are aware of that and have planned accordingly, fine, I just want to save you from disappointment if you were'nt.  \nEdit: As long as you arrive in Munich in before new years day, buying a Deutschlandticket just for december and buying a ticket to Salzburg seperately ( currently 20\u20ac ) + public transport tickets on the 1st and 2nd will be the cheapest option.",

            "body": "Warning: this is long. I suppose we might add a Wiki page about this at some point. Also: you might not like to hear this if you define yourself as \"German\".\n\nThe fact that during certain times, lots of people including Germans immigrated to the US might be mentioned, yes.\n\nBut apart from that... sorry, but this isn't as important to Germans as it appears to be for many US people who define themselves as being \"German\".\n\nFrom a German point of view, these people left, for reasons that must have been very pressing for them at the time. They decided that they no longer wanted to be German (or in many cases, a citizen of whichever smaller realm they lived in, as \"Germany\" is a rather new phenomenon), again for valid reasons.\n\nWe don't really consider these people a diaspora. They didn't get stranded somewhere where they're a persecuted group, or where they cannot leave again. They decided to move out.\n\nAlso, very important: Most of them have little to no connection to German culture, particularly *modern* German culture.\n\nThey split off, and if they preserved any \"German\" culture, it's often very local things from wherever they came from. Even today, Germany has so many regional traditions that it's not uncommon to read about a dish or a celebration or a word from somewhere else that you've never heard about in your life.\n\nSo people might be doing something \"German\" that's in reality been passed down in a game of Chinese whispers from someone's great-great-great-great-great-grandmother who lived in a small village in the Palatinate. A modern German might not even recognise it as something supposedly German.\n\nAlso, many \"German-Americans\" \"preserve\" bits of what they believe to be German culture, but it's actually a set of stereotypes formed in the US. A large part from that is the assumption that Bavarian things are typical for Germany, and that their German ancestors must have done these things. And suddenly you get \"German-American societies\" celebrating \"Oktoberfests\" [sic], wearing Bavarian-style clothing, and so on, even when most Germans who immigrated to their area came from the Lower Rhine or wherever.\n\nAs for the 40 million: this looks impressive, until you go into the numbers. Most of those 40 million people will also be of English descent, and any other number of ancestries... but if they're asked to self-identify (which I believe is how the US collect that data?), they'll pick the one that looks most interesting.\n\nConsidering the number of great-whatever ancestors everyone has, it's not surprising that there are Germans among them.\n\nAre you impressed when I tell you that I am descended from Charlemagne? The thing is... so is everyone else, including those \"German-Americans\" if they actually have an ancestor from hereabouts. https://www.theguardian.com/science/commentisfree/2015/may/24/business-genetic-ancestry-charlemagne-adam-rutherford\n\nSorry, all of this might seem harsh. \"German-Americans\" who post here trying to \"reconnect with their culture\" are often quite offended when told that from a German point of view, they *aren't German*.\n\nBut for us, the marker of being German isn't having a German ancestor somewhere. It's citizenship, and it's cultural immersion... particularly language. If a random German-American was dropped into Germany, they wouldn't get along better than the average American, and no one would perceive them as being German. Being American is *OK* though, and so is finding out about German ancestors, where they came from, etc.\n\nThe communication problems with Germans start, at least in posts here, when people think that a German ancestor gives them a special understanding of modern Germany, or makes them \"German\" in the way *we* define being German.",

But we have a lot saved so I don't have to \"support\" him in the same sense as if he had no savings to draw on.)

I just need to know how much net income I should be aiming for to have a good quality of life in Hamburg, so I can figure out what fees I need to charge. By good quality of life I mean: 2 bedroom apartment in a good area, good quality food and the ability to dine out and have a date night sometimes, be able to shop for decent furniture/clothes but not designer or anything, ability to travel a couple times a year, have a gym membership, etc. \n\nI appreciate any ballpark estimates.

Fairly small though, but accessible by regular bus from Aachen. Check for \"Reichsabtei Kornelim\u00fcnster\" on the map, that's the general area you'd be looking for.\n\nElse it's mostly walking/hiking/cycling in the nature all around, but if that's out of question, you might enjoy Maastricht (Netherlands). As you might have heard, the Dutchies have one of the flattest countries on the planet, so walking there is not challenging whatsoever, and it's also a nice, historic place with a slow pace of life in general.\n\nOh, and go to the Lindt chocolate factory outlet shop in Aachen. 1kg of assorted goodies for 5 Euros, that's been the highlight of everyone's trip that I brought :-P",

The trip is likely from 30th of June to 5-6th of July. We have a few things we've already considered and might do. Play paintball at City Paintball in Hamburg, seeing the miniatur wunderland, hit a golf course (or perhaps a few) and probably spend at least one night in a castle somewhere along the way. But we're not looking for the fastest route, we're happy to make detours along the way down to the track.\n\nWe're 38-37 years old (in case paintballing gave impression we were younger).

There is zero culture of drinking tap water in Germany, hence it's never offered as a freebie, if you ask nicely and say you need for a tablet, they usually will bring a small glass. Sprudel on the other hand is quite a cultural thing in Germany and traditionally was presented as a special treat to visitors, so the German restaurants are easily able to offer a bottle of Sprudel for \u20ac5.

If, as young people, have plans of staying out late while you are here, returning to Lichtenberg might need relying on night buses; they exist and they will get you there at any time of the night, but slowly and with tight connection times.\n\nThe other one seems to be within walking distance of a massive transport hub in the city centre, with all that this implies about accessibility. \n\n> And lastly, any idea in which bus zone the A&O Berlin Kolumbus is?\n\nIt's in Zone B, but it practically doesn't matter because the entire city of Berlin is either zone A or Zone B, but you can't buy tickets for those two zones individually, there's only one ticket that covers both (Berlin AB). \n\nThinking about zones only becomes necessary when you plan to visit outlying areas that aren't part of the city. The airport, for example, lies in Zone C as it is in the surrounding state of Brandenburg. You then have two ticket options, Berlin ABC (Berlin City + outlying areas) or Berlin BC (the city centre, Zone A, is excluded). If you don't plan to leave the city other than for the airport, get an AB ticket as a week pass or the relevant amount of time for your stay, and buy single ticket each time you need to go to the airport.",

This translates in English to \"dumb head\".\n\nIn the United States, \"dumb head\" stops being insulting after a person reaches the age of, oh, about 6 years old lol. I mean, it is a bottom-rung playground insult (which is itself a bottom-rung category of insults), not even a \"juvenile\" one because even juveniles would consider that insult beneath them. But, apparently in Germany, you all call each other \"dumb head!\" as adults, and it can actually mean something. \n\nWhy is this?

What confuses you about deductibles? There are none for medically necessary procedures. If there are you doctor will inform you before and give you the possibility to opt out.

You can download \"DB navigator\" and buy tickets there, along with finding the right connections.\n\nNow if there are destinations you want to visit that aren't accessible by public transportation, I would either recommend renting a car and hope that you find a parking garage with a reasonable daily rate or rent one for the days you want to actually use the car. Maybe car sharing could also be an option, I haven't used those yet so I couldn't tell you.\n\nIf you decide you want a car, I'd suggest looking for something around the size of a VW Golf. You don't wanna go too big, but as you'll be on the highway you don't want something to frail or with too little range either. Also please review German traffic laws if you decide to drive, you seriously don't want to be caught on the Autobahn with no clue what the conventions are.\n\nIf I were you: use public transportation and do a bit of walking. It's cheaper, you don't have to worry about your car, you can enjoy some pretty views from the comfort of your train and accessing inner cities with your car can be a bit of a headache anyways. Wanna see the alps while in Munich? Take a daytrip by train to Mittenwald or take the Sbahn to Lake Starnberg. You can even get to F\u00fcssen where Neu Schwanstein Castle is in 2 hours with 1 layover in between.

Few other things to mention, I do not have a lot of money with me (about 250\u20ac) so I am looking for mostly cheap things I can do. I have a place 20-30 minutes from the main station, my food situation is somewhat taken care of (but if you know cheap places, first sign up registration free deals, something allong those lines please do tell). As far as my interests go, everything interests me so please shoot your ideas. I am also open to spending the night in a hostel for a night if that means I can reach a remarkable/sublime place. (I can be at the main station as early as 7 AM to start the journey.) Other things to note I do love to hike (max 30-35km daily since I don't have equipment here with me). I would also like (but not a priority) to go bungee jumping (and willing to spend up to 100\u20ac for it and go wherever necessary to places where you jump off a bridge not a crane) Those are my first thoughts, I'll probably ask other things the coming days.

It's just a simple fact that it will be very difficult to survive - and if not \"surviving\", then at least finding a job here in Germany or in any country without speaking the native language of that country in general.

For Germany with a huge amount population who don't speak anything except German, it's true (excluding Berlin and some other big cities). When I came to the country knowing like 100 words, not even solid A1, it was a nightmare. With A2 my unsociable ass feels much better, still far from comfortable but anyway. \n\nWhat about learning - even people with intensive courses who are able not to do any other serious stuff, need like a year in the best case from A2 to B2.

These cities have been the ultimate seat of power in their countries for centuries, and as such were able to draw cultural, educatiomal and economic industry to this center. \n\nGermany only became a united country in the late 19th century, way later than England/UK and France. Before that, Berlin could only draw importance as a regional seat of power, one of many. Basicly every majour city still existing today was one.  From 1871, Berlin was capital of  the german empire, weimar republic and nazi germany,not because of prior historical importance, but simply because it was the seat of the emperors when the empire formed, and WR and the Nazis did not see a reason to change this. \n\nAfter 1945, Berlin was divided and parts of it eventually became a western enclave fully surrounded by east germany. So it only remained capital of east germany, the BRD capital became Bonn.  And with West-Berlin being on limited space with perilous transport routes from and to the rest of the BRD, it was not something where economic industries were keen to build a strong precence. The population was too small to support it becomeing a major cultural spot, and tourism for cultural reasons from the west was too limited to combat this.\n\n In the following decades, Berlin of course still had political importance during the cold war, as a symbol, but the west built their centers of culture, education and industry in other cities. \n\nWhen the DDR joined the BRD in the 90s, the unity contract of 1990 declared Berlin as capital. But it took time until it actually became it. The Government and Parliament did not move until 1999. And while industry also moved to the former DDR, thrre was no reason to give up established, well connected bases in the West for that. \n\nIf you look at it this way, Berlin had barely more than 20 years of being an actual center of power. Compare that with London, a city that first became capital in 1062.\n\nSo today, Berlin, hosting the national givernment and legislative body, is clearly the city with the most political importance. But all the other factors you mentioned, center of industry, education, culture, airports, etc., have found their places during a time when Berlin was not that, and could not draw them in.",

            "body": "Alternative for Germany is leading higher than Social Democrats in polls and have won vote to lead a district for the first time. What does this mean for Germany overall? This article showed up last week or so:\n\n> **Far-right AfD overtakes Germany's Social Democrats in polls**\n> \n> **If a federal election was held today in Germany, the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party would pick up more votes than the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), a new poll reveals.**\n> \n> In the ARD Deutschlandtrend poll released on Friday, almost a fifth (19 percent) of respondents said they were planning to vote for the AfD at the next federal election in Germany.\n> \n> This would make the far-right party the second largest in the Bundestag behind the centre-right CDU/CSU parties, which would pick up 29 percent of the vote, according to the poll. \n> \n> The centre-left SPD, who are currently heading up the three-party traffic light coalition alongside the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP), would be forced into third place with just 17 percent of the vote.\n> \n> The Green Party, which has recently seen approval ratings plummet due to its unpopular heating bill, would pick up 15 percent of votes, while their coalition partners in the FDP would accrue just six percent. \n> \n> Four percent of voters said they would vote for the Left Party, falling short of the five percent hurdle for entering the Bundestag. \n> \n> **Growing support for AfD**\n> \n> The poll is the latest in a series of surveys that have shown support growing for the far-right party among the German population. In a similar ARD poll on June 2nd, the AfD was level with the SPD on 18 percent. \n> \n> The latest figures represent a record level backing for the AfD among the German population. \n> \n> Speaking on ARD's Morgenmagazin programme, Thorsten Frei, the head of the CDU's parliamentary group, blamed the governing traffic-light coalition for the uptick in AfD support.\n> \n> \"If bad policies are made - and those can primarily be made by the government - then it is a stimulus programme for the political fringes,\" Frei said.\n> \n> The votes gained by the AfD can be traced directly back to votes lost for the SPD, Greens and FDP, he added.\n> \n> However, the government's antisemitism commissioner, Felix Klein, pointed out that the highest level of support for the far-right party could be seen in the former East Germany. \n> \n> \"The dissatisfaction with the overall development of society actually manifests itself more strongly there than in the West,\" he told DPA. \"It has to be better communicated - government work in general - and it must also be made clear to people that populists do not offer answers.\"\n> \n> **No coalition with AfD**\n> \n> So far in Germany, all other mainstream parties in the Bundestag have refused to work with the AfD and have said they would never enter a governing coalition with the party due to their extremist views.\n> \n> This effectively shuts the party out of government - unless they are able to get an overall majority, or more than 50 percent of the vote.\n> \n> In order to prevent AfD candidates from running in run-off elections for mayoral or district council offices, other parties have also recently joined forces.\n> \n> In another ARD poll, 52 percent said they thought this was the right thing to do, while more than a third of the respondents (35 percent) were against this kind of move. \n> \n> A further 13 percent either did not want to answer or did not know.\n\nhttps://www.thelocal.de/20230623/far-right-afd-overtakes-germanys-social-democrats-in-polls\n\n...along with this article:\n\n> **Germany's far-right AfD wins vote to lead district for first time**\n> \n> A far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate won a vote on Sunday to become a district leader in Europe's biggest economy for the first time, a breakthrough for the party which has hit record highs in national polls.\n> \n> The 10-year old AfD, with which Germany's mainstream parties officially refuse to cooperate due to its radical views, won a run-off vote in the Sonneberg district in the eastern state of Thuringia with its candidate garnering 52.8% of the vote.\n> \n> It is the latest success for the party which is riding a wave of popular discontent with Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's awkward coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) which is dogged by infighting over policy and the budget.\n> \n> Polling at 19%-20%, behind the opposition conservatives, the AfD is tapping into voter fears about recession, migration and the green transition, say analysts. It even plans to nominate a chancellor candidate in the 2025 federal election.\n> \n> While far-right parties have gained ground around Europe, the strength of the AfD is particularly sensitive in Germany due to the country's Nazi past.\n> \n> The President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, expressed deep shock.\n> \n> \"This is a watershed that this country's democratic political forces cannot simply accept,\" he told RND media.\n> \n> Particularly strong in the former Communist East, polls suggest the party may win three eastern state votes next year.\n> \n> A clear victory for the AfD's Robert Sesselmann in the district, which has a population of only around 56,000 people, sends a signal to Berlin, say analysts, especially as all other parties in Sonneberg joined forces in a front against him.\n> \n> Sesselmann was forced into a run-off against a conservative candidate after a vote two weeks ago. The conservative candidate won 47.2% on Sunday.\n> \n> The party opposes economic sanctions against Moscow over the Ukraine war and disputes that human activity is a cause of climate change.\n> \n> The domestic intelligence agency said this month that far-right extremism posed the biggest threat to democracy in Germany and warned voters about backing the AfD.\n> \n> Formed a decade ago as an anti-euro party, its popularity surged after the 2015 migrant crisis and it entered parliament in 2017, becoming the official opposition.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-far-right-afd-wins-vote-lead-district-first-time-2023-06-25/\n\n...and the place where AfD won is also the place where Nazi won for the first time. Does that mean that AfD will become the ruling party for sure and outlaw every single other parties like Nazi did before?\n\nFor a record, the next election is supposed to happen around later in 2025.",

You firstly need to do your mandatory driving hours before the practical test. Also: many driving schools have a backlog at the moment, I doubt you will be able to just cover the hours over a few weeks.

While on the whole, it's a lot easier to get a residence permit here than in the US, that is for *qualified* jobs, which is what the country wants to attract workers for. There's no interest in attracting people who do unskilled work that everyone who's already here could also do.\n\nThere's no \"at will\" here. Jobs come with notice periods for both sides, but there are strong rules for employers who can't just fire you because they want to. Those notice periods can reach multiple months.\n\nIf you were to find a job qualifying you for a residency permit and then change jobs, you would need to go through the process again of making sure that that job qualifies. Also, the early types of residence permit are often tied to a specific job. You can change the job, but again the new job needs to qualify.\n\nStart by reading the Wiki, linked in the post replied to, specifically anything about visas.",

The trip (\"project\") is once a year and they receive part of their funding from public sponsors (the local banks, businesses and what not). So upon their return they organize a \"Auschwitz evening\" to which they publicly invite everyone who is interested to present what they did and learned in Auschwitz, to give back to the sponsors and to ensure that they are inclined to sponsor next year:s group as well. \n\nWhat they do at that eveningd, is up to the students. Some have written and created theater plays. Some have done photo exhibits. Others have done public readings, presenting survivor reports. Some have done videos and presented them. Lots and lots and lots of symbols were used, and - depending on presentation - lots of Nazi vocabulary and phrases as well. All perfectly legal.",

I haven\u2019t heard any information confirming this and can\u2019t find anything online so I am not sure how true this is. Looking at the Visa requirements and exemptions by country on the federal foreign office website, it still appears that citizens from the U.S. can enter Germany without a Visa.

Yesterday, Amazon delivered my package to them. I got home really late so I decided it would be rude to ring their bell and ask for my package and thought I would do it today.\n\nSo I went to their apartment this afternoon to pick up my package, and they almost shouted at me. No \"hello\" or anything, as soon as they opened the door, they informed me of how annoyed they are that I am \"dumping\" my packages at their apartment (they don't speak German, they spoke English with me, and they specifically used the word \"dumping\"). They told me that \"we are not your parents and we are not responsible for your stuff\". They told me that I need to inform the post about this and that if it happens again, they will talk to the Hausmeister and the landlord (not sure what the Hausmeister has to do with this, lol).\n\nI have been living in this apartment for 2 years and I have been picking up my neighbors' packages when they are not home and my neighbors have been picking up my packages when I am not home without any problems. In fact, this is how I got to know most of my neighbors. But now I am not sure what to do with these new neighbors. I think they simply don't know that it is common for neighbors in Germany to have their packages delivered to neighbors. I tried explaining but they told me that I am wrong and that it doesn't make sense for the post to leave people's packages with the neighbors without permission of the neighbors. I honestly had no idea how to respond other than to say \"this is how it is, as far as I know\".\n\nI have lived in Germany for 3 years and up until this interaction, nobody has spoken to me so rudely, I want to avoid all contact with them. But now that I am going back to the office, I am sure that this situation will happen again with these new neighbors if they happen to be at home when the post delivers my package.\n\nWhat can I do?",

You can find out where to get them on the website of the local waste disposal service.\n\nIf you have blue, brown and black, those are for paper/carton, bio waste (*not* in plastic bags), and general waste.\n\nThe website of the waste disposal service will have more information on where to discard all kinds of items.

I didn't realize that I had left my favorite jacket in my old room until I had already boarded the train going away from Munich. I couldn't return back and called the hostel to see if they could hold onto it while I figured something out. I opted to have it shipped back home to me.\n\nAfter some back and forth, I eventually gave them my CC info and home address in the States. They initially emailed me (with an incorrect name) that it would be around \u20ac13.99 to ship back with insurance and the tracking number would be provided. I didn't know which company would be used until the tracking number was provided (DHL). I eventually was sent an email stating that \n\"custom control sent back the jacket to the hostel. They need us to tell them the value of the jacket, how much does it cost? Please tell us, only this way we can resend the package to the United States. This is a border regulation policy.\" I had already been charged for the initial shipping which was \u20ac7.99 which I didn't mind since it wasn't so bad. Days after telling them the price of the jacket (\u20ac30 from years ago), I got another email today that they \"tried to send the jacket to you (me) again but this time it would cost you (me) 49,99 euro due to the international transfer and custom charges.\" \n\nI got taken back and was confused since I thought that info would've been provided at the start of the shipping process before payment. I've never used DHL so I'm not sure of their process but I am sensing a red flag here. Is this common when shipping back a jacket to the States? I truly would love to have my jacket back.",

Customs need to assess what the value of the goods is to avoid potential losses to tax revenue wherever you are. DHL has no control over the initial cost, since they cannot know themselves what value US customs will place on the goods. For the sake of argument, imagine you declare the jacket is worth \u20ac5, customs will still do their own valuation and your liability will be based on theirs.\n\nMost likely somebody put a value of \u20ac30 and \u20ac19,90 handing fee or something.

For example, I have a German EHIC (with TK) but can also easily pick up an EHIC from my doctor in my home EU country where health insurance is voluntary and free at point of use.

It all just happened in two steps:\n\nStep 1: Someone many years ago created a registration form and added man and woman as the two options, because that's just what everyone expects from a registration form. It was probably just part of whatever sample code someone pulled together to bootstrap the application.\n\nStep 2: In the last few years it became untenable to only offer a binary choice so someone else went ahead and added a third option without thinking too much about it. \n\nSo, indeed, don't overthink it. No-one at Expatrio probably thought what they meant with that question. \n\nIf it ever becomes legally important, just send a request to update your information because it's not accurate.",

This is my first time posting so apologies if this isn't a suitable question. \n\n  \nI am an expat from the US who has been living in Iceland for \\~4 years, and I've just received a job offer from an NGO in Berlin (yay!) -- but I wanted to ask those living in Berlin or who have lived there if the salary they are offering me is liveable / if there is any insight you guys might be able to give on if it's acceptable. Mainly my concern is that it's much lower than my current salary. However, the cost of living and rent in Reykjavik is pretty high so maybe it's all relative.   \n\n\nThey are offering me 43.000 EUR annually. Since they're a small NGO this is their only offer. After the trial period of 6 months there is the potential to discuss a \"moderate increase\" in salary. Beyond this the contract has 25 holiday days, and doesn't appear to offer relocation assistance. \n\n  \nIt's an amazing job & I've been wanting to leave Reykjavik for a while, I just want to check on the realistic situation in Berlin & if anyone has a perspective on this.

If you believe in their goal and ideals, it's probably as good as it gets.\n\nMost NGOs only have representative offices in Germany anyway specifically to lobby the local government, since there are no tax incentives - hence all the global/European HQs tend to be in Amsterdam or London, where they are largely tax exempt. That makes it especially rare to hire non-German speakers.\n\nAs for the salary, it's about 2x the minimum wage, so definitely liveable and then some. Especially if you only have one mouth to feed.

I tried googling this but only got results for Kinder\u00e4rztlicher Notdienst but I feel like this is something different (i.e. \u201cMy child threw up and needs a doctors note for school\u201d vs \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night and I think my infant is dying.\u201d)\n\nThat said, there was one episode with a nine year old little girl who had a tumor in her belly and the Notaufnahme wanted to transfer her to a children\u2019s hospital for emergency surgery\u2026 The children\u2019s hospital literally would not allow her parents to go with her and she was just alone for the entire ordeal\u2026 wtf.",

There are 5 weekends (from around 12Uhr Fri to 21Uhr Sun when there will be a bus that takes the students back) in the next Bavarian school year that she has to go outside and not allowed to stay inside the Internat. Next weekend that she has to go out will be from 29.9 to 3.10 (Independence Day). Here comes the problem:\n\nThe only \u00dcbernachtung choices for the next go-out I can think of is either a Ho(s)tel, a&o or Jugendherberge. But none of those have rooms available between that timeframe, or the price is at least 50\u20ac a night, and even for a ho(s)tel idk if she would be accepted as an underage. I live in Dortmund so she can't just take a whole day total just to travel and wait for delayed trains. The only option is for her to make a German friend and let them invite her to their house each time, though she is kinda shy so I'm worried.\n\nThe other problem is that I also want to buy more things for her to prepare for new school year, but got blocked by 2 Klausur on the 15th and 19th. I'm going to either go back and use the shit out of my Deutschlandticket, either after the Klausur or right on 29th and let her visit some city.\n\nThus I need some help from everyone:\n* What day should I go?\n* Which are the possible options for her to stay during the remaining 4 go-out weekends? \n\nI will provide more necessary info if needed",

I understand the progressive tax system, but I have a question how is it applied in practice.\n\nI understand once I arrive to Germany and am done with my anmeldung, I will receive my tax ID within some weeks that I can give to my employer. However, which tax percentage will be applied? How can I change if there's a basic one on the tax ID?\n\nWill it go more towards one of these scenarios?\n\n**Scenario 1.)** I estimate somewhere, maybe in web or german office for my Tax ID my expected salary and based on this I have fixed percentage to be applied, let's say 100k$ earning and 30% avg tax percent for example\n\n* I assume it's more likely this scenario, so follow up question is where do I change or set the percentage once I receive my tax id\n\n**Scenario 2.)** The earning are truly taxed as below, so for first 10k I make, I pay no taxes, then progressively more and more I earn during calendar year. Meaning end of the year I always the most possible taxes from my monthly salary?\n\nIncome\tTax Rate\n\nLess than 9.744 euros\t0%\n\n9.744 - 57.918 euros\t14% to 42%\n\n57.919 - 274.612 euros\t42%\n\nMore than 274.613 euros\t45%\n\nAt least in Finland **Scenario 1.** is applied. You get the tax card based on your previous year earning and you can change the salary expectation for the year and print the tax card accordingly with the right percentage and you forward that to your employer for use. This can be adjusted during the year if your earnings change.\n\nThanks!",

No one will tell you what to do, and when to do it, except for occasional homework that may be voluntary, but that can give you a rough guideline of how far you need to be along.\n\nThis university targets people who are significantly older than your average student (average age is 38 I think), who are working (so you can do things part-time), who have families, and so on. Being a bit mean towards younger people: essentially it's for adults who are already established in their life and have figured out various things that an 18-year-old might not have.\n\n>Or maybe there is an easier fernuni I am not aware of?\n\nNone that is reputable.\n\nHow are you with mathematics? Informatik is *very* maths-heavy. In the first semester you'll need to take a mandatory class where you have to go through 150 to 190 pages of a very dense script every two weeks, covering the foundations of everything. And it's not school mathematics where you just calculate something, but rather proofs, definitions and so on. From what I heard, 50 percent fail the final exam on the first try (and that's only the people who attempt it).\n\nIt's doable, of course, and people do it.

To be honest I cannot afford to just quit my job and fly to Germany while being temporarily jobless for several months. Theoretically money wise I can probably afford that, but in my circumstances it's better for me to just work in my current job and spend money for jobseeker visa and flight as needed because I also need to financially support my parents and siblings. \r  \n\r  \nAlso while I have relevant experiences, my degree doesn't correlate with what I do in my job at all.

German students need their Abitur results to apply for the winter semester (or in case of a Master their Bachelor results).\n\nAs for accommodation, finding something from abroad is mostly impossible in any case, and finding something more than three months in advance as well. When you move from abroad, the realistic situation is living in temporary accommodation for some time, and looking for more permanent housing while you are present.",

However, TU Darmstadt open their applications on June 1st while TU Dresden have theirs from 1st April to 31st May. \n\nAlso, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, Abitur is the entry qualification for a bachelors degree, right? I am confused as to why they would have such late deadlines for postgraduate degrees for non-EU students. Often times I see that they have early deadlines for non-EU and later ones for German nationals.\n\nAs for the accommodation, I am aware that finding accommodation is challenging enough if you\u2019re in Germany, let alone being abroad. But I can at least start adding my name to waiting lists?",
