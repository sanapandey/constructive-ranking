    "selftext": "Hallo,\n\n\nLong story short, i am ( 30M ) living in Germany. \n\nRegarding current happenings in the world, I would like to join an army and help Europe and NATO.\n\nI am hungarian, but im disgusted by my own country and nation and i dont wanna serve there. \n\nI dont have citizenship, i am far from it. \n\nIs there any possibility that the Bundeswehr accept foreigners without citizenship ? \n\nDoes anyone know anything about that? \n\nI have heard that its possible, then i heard its not possible, then i heard maybe and so on .\n\nDanke sehr\n\nEdit: my words get twisted. You guys get my point, stop twisting the shit out of my words. \n\nAlso thank you for everyone who contributed with a constructive response! ",
