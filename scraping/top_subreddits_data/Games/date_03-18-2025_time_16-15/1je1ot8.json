The Illuminate and Terminids don\u2019t change the cities too much but the Bots build their own cities basically in the skeleton of the old city. The map I was on was like 50% city without exaggeration with lots of new bot stuff all around.  Nice to have actual firefights and urban warfare in a huge city instead of just being chased through the streets like with the Illuminate and Terminids.",

Sure you can't really mix and match them, but they fit the theme of the Warbond immensely and they look so good doing it.\n\nThese outfits just look like generic Helldiver armor with a poncho and a single bandolier. Sure, they're a bit more mix and matchable but that comes at the expense of like...the theme of the set.\n\nThe capes really fit with the theme of this set though and I really love them.

Literally search Helldivers 2 super credits on YouTube and you\u2019ll see hundreds of videos showing how easy it is.
