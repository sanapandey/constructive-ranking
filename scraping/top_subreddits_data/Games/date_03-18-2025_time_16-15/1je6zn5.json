You have to explore the world on foot and take it all in before using the mech.\n\nIt's kind of like Breath of the Wild allowing you to explore on land and experience the world and then Tears of the Kingdom letting you fly with your own contraptions lol.\n\nThough supposedly DE makes it easier to get the mechs in terms of less grind required once you reach the stage.",

Making you slog it out on foot for hours first gives you a real appreciation for the mech once you finally do get it. Compare it to Fallout 4 that hands you your first suit of power armor within five minutes of leaving the vault, and it just doesn't feel as special as it should.",

They all have an auto attack as the basic attack with cooldowns and gauges for the other moves. If I remember correctly this one was closer to the combat of 1, if that helps.

Basically ending on an abrupt cliff hanger right before the point the other games tie together. I think it would be safe to assume this game will tie into the others now that it's finished.
