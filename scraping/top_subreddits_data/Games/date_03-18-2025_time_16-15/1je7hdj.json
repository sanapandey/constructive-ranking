            "body": "The main part from the article:\n\n\nLast week Sakurai collected his award and gave an interview to Japanese entertainment news website Entax (as spotted by Automaton), in which he said he felt that Japanese studios should focus on what domestic audiences like, rather than trying to make a game that may appeal to the West.\n\nAccording to Sakurai, Western players buy Japanese games with the expectation that they will provide something different from Western-developed games, so there\u2019s no need for Japanese studios to adapt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily my own idea, but the trend in the games industry is that Japanese people should go for what Japanese people like,\u201d Sakurai explained (via machine translation).\n\n\u201cA while ago, there was certainly a culture of making Americanised products, because various works were popular in the US. However, I feel that \u2018Japanese game lovers\u2019 overseas are not looking for such things, but for something unique and interesting from Japan.\n\n\u201cIn other words, I think the ideal is to make the games the way you like them, and the people who can accept them will enjoy them.\u201d",

They're not concrete labels, but they're still useful when describing particular styles that are heavily influenced by the culture of said region. It's why I can make a distinction between \"Western\" animation and \"Japanese\" animation in the television industry, and people know exactly what I'm talking about. That doesn't mean ALL Japanese animation is the same, or ALL western animation is the same, it's just a term we use to describe a generalized design philosophy.\n\nRegarding the three games you mentioned, the genres themselves may not be region specific, but they're chock full of design decisions that are far more common in the west than they are in Japan. For example, games like Baldur's Gate 3 are designed with massive, branching paths and a heavy focus on player agency. This is a style of game that rarely, if ever, gets attempted in Japan, and much of the genre's roots can be found in tabletop RPGs that were popularized in the west during the 70's and 80's. That doesn't mean Japanese RPGs as a whole aren't influenced by western trends, and it also doesn't mean that these style of games are exclusive to one region, but if a Japanese studio attempted to make an RPG with the same design philosophies as something like a Fallout, then some might argue that they're taking inspiration from a western mindset, in the same way some will argue that Expedition 33, one of the first western RPGS in a long time to incorporate a linear, turn-based combat system, is taking inspiration from a Japanese mindset.\n\nWe use these kinds of labels all the time in film and, especially, music. It stands to reason that they'd be used in video games as well.",

FF as a series has lost most of its core fandom of guaranteed buyers in exchange for gambling on a massive success like western AAA publishers do and it's having some major lows for them despite a few big wins.\n\nI think Sakurai has a great point in that the reason people who like Japanese games got into them is because it was different from what they already had and they liked that difference. If devs who usually make games for their home market abandon that market for another they end up losing both their home market and all foreign fans of that market.

Something like Shadow Generations or SAB2 comes to mind. And then you look at something like Sonic Colors or Boom, which goes out of its way to feel very western...\n\nThat said, for that specific franchise, I think there's a delicate balance. But my overall sentiment is that Sakurai is 100% correct. The games coming out of Japan that gamers love are loved BECAUSE they feel different. Even Mario, probably the most broadly appealing IP in gaming, has a certain Japanese sensibility to it, especially in the series' most successful games imo.",

If people liked the games before they started making them specifically for western audiences, I don\u2019t think you need to change massively how you\u2019re developing those games. I would like Japanese developers to maybe take some cues from the rest of the industry in optimisation because there have been disproportionately many badly performing games coming out of Japan that never really get fixed. It is one thing to have a game launch in a bad state but then get patched, but a game like Elden Ring is still running badly and Monster Hunter Wilds is certainly not a winner on the performance front",

Gaming is the most popular it's ever been in part because it's the easiest to get into as it's ever been. So many of these foreign game franchises as far back as like 2015, I found out about from YouTube or similar and went \"I want to play that.\" The vast majority I've bought digitally, no shipping or printing necessary on the part of the developer or publisher. If a game is great in one location, it'll most likely find a sizeable audience elsewhere, too.\n\nI still see game devs censoring character designs because of \"western sensibilities\" and it's like please go look at what Nexon has gotten away with in The First Descendant and tell me with a straight face that this is a necessary practice. People's complaints with that game are about the monetization compared to its competitors and the endgame content, not that as soon as mission 1 is over the city hub is filled with so many bikinis and bodysuit wedgies that an ass lover might legitimately think they had died and gone to heaven.",

He had the right idea at the time when JP devs were struggling in adapting to the HD development, but as we see in retrospect, he had the wrong execution to solve the issue. It's not all bad during this era, but most can agree that games in this era are generally not as good as its predecessors, whether its DmC, Bionic Commando Reboot, Remember Me, or RE6. And this is on top on their some bizarre, downright idiotic practices like on-disc DLC (SFxTekken), or releasing an Ultimate version just months after the base game with no way to upgrade the game (looking at you MVC3)\n\nNowadays, Capcom made a hard pivot back to Japanese developed games, but you can see the Western sensibilities and appeal are still there. Ever since Monster Hunter World, their games look very Western-oriented but the DNA in their games are still very Japanese oriented. That said, what Sakurai said is not either of these approaches, but rather wanting games as it were made in the 80-90s: making the games to appeal to their domestic fanbases rather than being easily swept away to the wider audience demands.",

Brawl was the addition of the 'Trip' mechanic. \n\n**This was specifically added because the Japanese audience treated and wanted Super Smash Bros as a party game, not a competitive game.**\n-\n\nUltimately (no pun intended) the west **did** influence Sakurai by proxy because the west treated the game as an esport and that scene permeated into Japan, **NOT** the other way around, which pushed Sakurai to incorporate that demographic into their design decisions. \n\nHad Sakurai continued the path of treating Super Smash Bros as a party game exclusively and continued to add features that detracted from the casual play in lieu of Japan-esque humor gaffs such as tripping randomly, I promise the game wouldn't have been as popular and this article's comments would be met with \"Yeah, look how good that worked out for Super Smash Bros... everyone only plays your first version...\"\n\nAll that to say, it's easy for the casual /r/games user to circlejerk into agreeing with any director that deem 'good' without really thinking through the implications or if that opinion is truly based in objectivity.",

Studio management isn't strictly divided between the creative and technical sides. Staying on top of the best technical innovations requires studying games from other countries, but I think it's natural to also pick up some creative ideas when you do that.

The fact that the director admitted this probably means that there was indeed an internal attempt to make the series more Western, and it failed.\n\nThere\u2019s also been online drama over altering aspects of games to \u201cappeal to a broader audience\u201d and such but at the end of the day directors are just realizing that there\u2019s actually a high demand for Japanese stuff. It\u2019s probably a holdover from the days when Kirby had to be given angry eyebrows to keep the cover art from being too cute or whatever.",
