Aside for patent being like for pretty detailed format how it works (meaning you can work around to not copy patented method of it), Nemesis System does have issue that it requires to be one of core considerations of game design of title that would use, so you're overall kind of working to fit into pretty specific framework of what kind of game you're making to fit into utilizing that idea.",

The patent covers the very specific implementation of the nemesis system as it appeared in the Mordor games, but it does nothing to prevent functionally identical systems from existing in other games. Take the Kuva Liches from Warframe for example, WB ain't suing digital extremes and those have existed for half a decade.\n\nDevelopers have explained the reason why you don't see other games use the Nemesis system: Because it would require so much work to make functional that you would basically need to center the game around it in order to justify its inclusion. A massive amount of work would need to go into a system that can dynamically create NPC looks, behaviors, and abilities out of existing pieces in a way that makes the game more interesting.",

That's fine, but obviously it was extremely rare to have because the cost of doing so was not worth it to devs/publishers.\n\nThe major issue is them patenting the system then doing virtually nothing with the system themselves and clearly hampering the ability of other devs from using it. At that point a patent holder is just using the patent to grab money from others rather than use the patent for the original purpose of a patent: rewarding the creator with an exclusive time to use their invention to recoup the costs and giving them exclusive profitability as the financial incentive for them to continue using said invention for the benefit of themselves and the public. Creating something, using it once, then just sitting on it despite it being something that can massively benefit the industry the company is a part of is one step above being a patent troll.",

Devs are free to take that knowledge and build a better system if they can.\n\nAnd on that latter point, has there ever been any public comments from a developer of actual note lamenting how the Nemesis system patent has hampered their ability to develop the game they want?

That's fine, but obviously it was extremely rare to have because the cost of doing so was not worth it to devs/publishers.\n\nDo you have any evidence that Test Drive paid Namco to have pong in their loading screens? Or did they just implement it in a way that doesn't infringe upon Namco's patent? Even if they paid Namco, that still opens up the possibility of patented systems being used outside of the patent holder, which goes against the claims that the patents can be sat on and not used.\n\nRemember, Nintendo had a patent on + style d-pads for years, which didn't prevent other controller makers from making their own version of the d-pad.
