It has shades of a life but it's not as comprehensive right now. I'm willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt at the moment, and I've played the game since launch, the experience has only gotten better.",

The bones of a good game are there, but the performance issues (I often drop to <15fps on a 3080ti at medium), bugs, and gameplay issues are often too much for me to be enjoying myself.\n\nPersonally, while the community doesn't agree with me, I also find the plot/dialog/English voice acting to be really amateurish, and the way they designed the outdoors it's very difficult to discern enemies from foliage without using your headlamp, which is a death sentence.\n\nStalker 2 is one of those games that has so many good parts we all want to ignore the bad, but.... it's a lot for me to ignore. Maybe some day it will be brilliant but it needs the Cyberpunk 2077 treatment imo.",

Also having to play carefully and thoughtfully to navigate new challenges was a blast all the way through.  Poking around an old bunker or rotted out village to find a stash or a rare item was always fun.",
