The one before it was way better.\n\nThree years later: the newest Zelda sucks actually. The one before it was the best in the series.\n\nEight years later, after another game or two has released: actually, it's the new one that sucks. The one before (that was previously stated to have sucked) is the good one.\n\nI've seen this happen no less than 4 times. Wind Waker was Celda, it was kiddie bullshit after the darkness and sadness of OoT and MM. Then it was the best game ever once TP came out, because TP was too edgy for its own good and the graphics weren't going to look nearly as good in 5 years the way Wind Waker's did (in fairness, this bit was true, WW still looks good today, TP doesn't). Then Skyward came out and TP is the best game ever because it was darker and edgier and had big open fields while Skyward wasn't edgy in the slightest and was super linear and focused heavily on its main story. Then BotW came out and suddenly everyone missed linearity and storytelling.\n\nIt's all so damn annoying.",
