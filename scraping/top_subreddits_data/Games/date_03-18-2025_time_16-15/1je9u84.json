I was obsessed with finishing the assassination targets and working through the Objective board with many late nights to see it through. The wait for Ubisoft to bring the series to Japan has been worth it, especially given the technical appeal of modern gaming making it even more impressive than I had imagined. Naoe and Yasuke are my definitive heroes for this series, two individuals who are wonderfully portrayed by their respective actors, and the talented team that brought them to life.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Alparslan G\u00fcrlek](https://opencritic.com/critic/7536/alparslan-g-rlek) - *Turkish* - [84 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/assassins-creed-shadows-inceleme/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows has taken a long-overdue step forward with its new mechanics and technical improvements. You'll just have to overlook the mediocre writing and a narrative that lacks pacing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Jason Flatt](https://opencritic.com/critic/6622/jason-flatt) - [6 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft/)\n\n>It\u2019s a well-crafted game within its own scale with a great story and emotionally resonant characters, but in the grand scheme of what a big open-world RPG could provide, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows doesn\u2019t maximize its potential.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Nick Erlenhof](https://opencritic.com/critic/8745/nick-erlenhof) - *German* - [8.5 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-assassins-creed-shadows-samurai-ehre-trifft-gekonnt-auf-shinobi-stealth/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is the best installment in the series for a long time and brings many fresh ideas to the table. The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k) - [9 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story. Add in the beautiful backdrop of medieval Japan throughout the seasons, and you've got a hit.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cloud Dosage](https://opencritic.com/outlet/951/cloud-dosage)** - [Jon Scarr](https://opencritic.com/critic/11148/jon-scarr) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://clouddosage.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-review/)\n\n>Whether Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is the best entry in the series depends on what you enjoy. If you enjoy tactical stealth, the game delivers. If you\u2019re more into a challenging combat experience, Yasuke\u2019s overwhelming strength may leave you wanting more.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComicBook.com](https://opencritic.com/outlet/862/comicbook-com)** - [Cade Onder](https://opencritic.com/critic/2098/cade-onder) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Although Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows has some cumbersome flaws that can\u2019t be overlooked, including ones that have been present in the series since its inception, it is a strong action-adventure game that I will likely keep investing in for weeks to come.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComingSoon.net](https://opencritic.com/outlet/845/comingsoon-net)** - [Tyler Treese](https://opencritic.com/critic/65/tyler-treese) - [9 / 10](https://www.comingsoon.net/games/reviews/1939657-assassins-creed-shadows-review-ps5-japan)\n\n>This sprawling epic regularly features gorgeous sights of Japan and incredibly fun gameplay with a newfound freedom of how you approach it. It winds up being the best Assassin\u2019s Creed game in years and a true joy over its 60+ hour journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Court LaLonde](https://opencritic.com/critic/10476/court-lalonde) - [8 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an unexpected amount of player agency against the Feudal Japan backdrop fans of the series have wanted for ages.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/assassins-creed-shadows-307262/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is the culmination of years of evolution in the saga, blending refined action/RPG gameplay with one of the series' most captivating settings. The contrast between Naoe and Yasuke offers distinct playstyles, encouraging variety and experimentation. Stealth mechanics are more polished than ever, while combat, though not as deep as a pure action game, remains fun and well-balanced.\n>\n>Feudal Japan is recreated with exceptional detail, thanks to top-tier artistic direction and a solid technical foundation, benefiting from the departure from old consoles. The seasonal cycle isn\u2019t just aesthetic but adds meaningful gameplay dynamics, keeping exploration engaging.\n>\n>However, some concerns remain. The Animus Hub feels more like an unfinished concept than a true revolution, and the modern-day storyline risks becoming secondary again. Some design choices, like character switching, could have been smoother.\n>\n>Overall, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows delivers an immersive experience that will satisfy longtime fans eager for this setting within the series' lore, as well as newcomers drawn by its Eastern allure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-the-best-since-black-flag-3164004/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed has been fighting to find its identity for over a decade, and thanks to Shadows it's finally rediscovered it. Sure, its combat can be clunky and some story beats felt oddly placed (particularly Yasuke's backstory), but Shadows is exactly what Assassin's Creed needed to prove it still has a beating heart. Whether you\u2019re looking to explore the stunning world of feudal Japan, storm the gates of an enemy castle, or fall in love with the many NPCs that populate its world, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive treat that cements itself as the best Assassin's Creed game since Black Flag.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/63927)\n\n>\"A worthy heir to a venerable lineage\"\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows offers one of the most distinctive stealth and infiltration experiences in the series, thanks to its dual-hero system and richly detailed world. Improved AI, environmental interaction, and the impact of seasons on gameplay make it an immersive experience for fans of stealth and tactical combat. Despite some flaws, Ubisoft Quebec has succeeded in delivering a well-rounded experience that combines the series' authenticity with its innovations.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [3 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/37187)\n\n>The real star of \u201cAssassin's Creed: Shadows\u201d is the visually stunning game world. It impresses with its many details, beautiful weather effects and changing seasons. It is perhaps the most beautiful open game world I have ever experienced. Unfortunately, this spectacular backdrop offers little substance despite the solid gameplay basis. Repetitive missions, boring side activities and a half-baked story leave me unsatisfied overall.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Enternity.gr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/783/enternity-gr)** - [Giannis Archontidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/8646/giannis-archontidis) - *Greek* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.enternity.gr/Article/Games/Reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/93784.html)\n\n>Whether you're a fan of the gorgeous old Assassin's Creed, the new open world, or just joining the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows should not be missing from any library!\n\n-------------\n\n**[Entertainment Geekly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/874/entertainment-geekly)** - [Luis Alvaro](https://opencritic.com/critic/9991/luis-alvaro) - [3 / 5](https://www.entertainmentgeekly.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review-a-stunning-but-exhausting-samurai-fantasy)\n\n>If you\u2019ve been longing for a classic Assassin\u2019s Creed experience, you\u2019ll find moments of brilliance here\u2014but they come with frustrations as well. And if you\u2019ve grown tired of Ubisoft\u2019s copy-paste open-world formula, Shadows won\u2019t change your mind.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Eurogamer.pt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/832/eurogamer-pt)** - [Adolfo Soares](https://opencritic.com/critic/8989/adolfo-soares) - *Portuguese* - [3 / 5 ](https://www.eurogamer.pt/assassins-creed-shadows-review-analise)\n\n>Ubisoft has finally released Assassin's Creed Shadows, after several setbacks. It follows the formula of the series, without taking any risks, limiting itself to delivering a game that is consistent with what fans already know. Naoe is a nice surprise, while Yasuke doesn't seem to know what he's doing here. Anyone who likes the saga will love Shadows, but it's a shame it's not more daring.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Fextralife](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife)** - Fexelea - [8.5 / 10](https://fextralife.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Expansive, detailed and polished, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a fantastic exploration and stealth game with beautiful Japanese aesthetics, somewhat diminished by a thin story, clumsy narrative, and immersion-breaking design choices. Despite this, it's a thoroughly enjoyable entry into the series for fans seeking to explore medieval Japan.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Jakub Paluszek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10596/jakub-paluszek) - *Polish* - [6 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/assassins-creed-shadows-recenzja-gry-rutynowy-otwarty-swiat/z046f0)\n\n>I have experienced quite a few really cool moments while playing Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows, but after 40 hours of playtime all those moments are lost in time like tears in rain. This new Creed has some interesting ideas to shake up the formula, but none of them are good enough to make it count. All in all, any potential for greatness was squandered for yet another opportunity to make a very big game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Lodge ](https://opencritic.com/outlet/927/game-lodge-)** - [Silvio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10917/silvio-diaz) - *Portuguese* - [10 / 10](https://gamelodge.com.br/critica-assassins-creed-shadows-o-reconhecimento-para-a-evolucao/)\n\n>The latest game in the franchise is what it is because it looks back and recognizes everything it has done in its history. It brings together the best of all those years and manages to be a brilliant piece of work in every way. Visually beautiful, engaging and extremely fun, combining so many systems. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the best Assassin's Creed ever made and the definitive Medieval Japan game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant)** - [Matt Karoglou](https://opencritic.com/critic/10492/matt-karoglou) - [9 / 10](https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a spectacular return to form for the franchise, delivering one of the series' more tightly focused historical adventures.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameGrin](https://opencritic.com/outlet/436/gamegrin)** - [Anna Duncan](https://opencritic.com/critic/3106/anna-duncan) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>A game that's not without its issues, but is a great entry in the franchise, and didn't feel the need to cram in a ship to captain.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameffine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/854/gameffine)** - [Uphar Dutta](https://opencritic.com/critic/9127/uphar-dutta) - [80 / 100](https://www.gameffine.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows was supposed to work in the dark to serve the light, but it never managed to step beyond the shadows. It plays it too safe while trying to go back to the roots, but it also goes back on the unwanted systems, including the leveling-based progression. This \u201cone step forward, and two steps back\u201d sentiment makes Shadows just another entry in a long list of Assassin\u2019s Creed games and nothing more.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Patrick Lamers](https://opencritic.com/critic/7468/patrick-lamers) - *Dutch* - [4 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-stapt-uit-de-schaduw/6099-29-1-194)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a great step forward for the series, with an intriguing story, varied characters, and a well-executed - eventhough a little repetitive - medieval Japan setting, making it a must-have for Assassin's Creed fans and open-world adventure lovers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Maciej Bogusz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10595/maciej-bogusz) - [7 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-great-combat-and-stealth-where-plo/ze75b)\n\n>Assassin's Creed: Shadows is a game full of contrasts. On one hand, it offers solid stealth mechanics and a great combat system, but on the other, it features a lackluster storyline and generic exploration. If you're a fan of the series, you'll likely find something to enjoy here, but if you weren't convinced from the start, the combat and stealth may not be enough to win you over.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamer Escape](https://opencritic.com/outlet/452/gamer-escape)** - [Eliot Lefebvre](https://opencritic.com/critic/6542/eliot-lefebvre) - [8 / 10](https://gamerescape.com/2025/03/18/review-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>And that's really the ultimate takeaway. It has a load of really fun parts, a fun gameplay loop, an engaging story, and an earnest effort to split the difference between the various elements of the franchise history. It's a good game! Take these reservations not as a subversion of that fact, but for what they are: Acknowledgement of its limitations.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamer Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/733/gamer-guides)** - [Tom Hopkins](https://opencritic.com/critic/2535/tom-hopkins) - [85 / 100](https://www.gamerguides.com/assassins-creed-shadows/review)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows in a nutshell is a more refined, polished game with more of the same formula. This isn\u2019t a big revamp, nor are there any deep changes to the formula. However, it\u2019s the best the series has been for a while. Fun combat, a pair of genuinely interesting protagonists, and a gorgeous recreation of 16th century Japan mean the flaws are easier to overlook.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gfinity](https://opencritic.com/outlet/803/gfinity)** - [Alister Kennedy](https://opencritic.com/critic/10213/alister-kennedy) - [10 / 10](https://gfinityesports.com/article/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph. Yasuke and Naoe are among the best protagonists the series has ever seen, and the return to stealth gameplay is a massive win for longtime fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Glitched Africa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/687/glitched-africa)** - [Marco Cocomello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2466/marco-cocomello) - [9 / 10](https://www.glitched.africa/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows takes the series to new heights in ways we have been longing for. Ubisoft has delivered the most remarkable world I think we have seen from the studio yet. This, combined with a rich setting, dynamic gameplay styles, and a good balance of action and stealth, makes Shadows the best entry in the series. In many ways, it is going to be hard for Ubisoft to top this.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>An amazing journey that we embarked on in feudal Japan alongside Naoe and Yasuke. The story and gameplay were both thrilling and enjoyable, alongside its massive content, making it undoubtedly Ubisoft's most visually stunning game and the best Assassin's Creed game of the last decade.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Kakuchopurei](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei)** - [Jonathan Toyad](https://opencritic.com/critic/7505/jonathan-toyad) - [70 / 100](https://www.kakuchopurei.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review-kkp/)\n\n>[...] Assassin's Creed Shadow is still a decently fun action adventure-slash-role-playing hybrid (stats, grinding, and all that jazz) if you really need a huge timesink with a ton of money backed onto it. It may not change your mind about the Ubisoft formula of open-world games. \n>\n>But through it all, formulas work because they're comfort food and deliver what is expected while looking darn good and polished doing so, without any fuss. And with a great soundtrack that mixes traditional with contemporary beats & melodies.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Le B\u00eata-Testeur](https://opencritic.com/outlet/943/le-b-ta-testeur)** - [Gabriel Desrosiers](https://opencritic.com/critic/11067/gabriel-desrosiers) - *French* - [9.3 / 10](https://www.lebetatesteur.ca/test-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>This is definitely one of the best games in the franchise. It's a complete game with great improvements, the story is well-constructed, and the player has a lot of freedom in their actions. Without distorting the franchise, I was able to enjoy the game almost as much as the first games. It's not far from equaling Black Flags or the Ezio trilogy.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [9.5 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph. An addictive adventure in a stunningly provocative open world, and an absolute must play.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Manual dos Games](https://opencritic.com/outlet/910/manual-dos-games)** - [Luan Fernandes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10817/luan-fernandes) - *Portuguese* - [9.2 / 10](https://manualdosgames.com.br/review-assassins-creed-shadows-ps5/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a great game\u2014everything that every fan of the franchise has always imagined. With refined combat, breathtaking scenery, captivating characters, and a simple yet very effective storyline, Shadows is undoubtedly an outstanding game. It brings the Japanese setting to life in an excellent way, and I am sure it will earn its place among Ubisoft's greatest games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) - *Italian* - [8.8 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3737/assassin-s-creed-shadows.html)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows succeeds in immersing us in a beautiful medieval Japan, full of activities and missions to be carried out with the character we prefer; the settings, the narrative/cinematic approach, and the stealth gameplay are its strengths, but it's a pity for its too weak connection to the franchise's meta-lore and a sometimes disorienting mission structure. Regardless, if you love the series, action RPGs, or Japanese settings, it is a title not to be missed.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso) - [4 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>While not perfect, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a great ninja simulator and an okay open world game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[New Game Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/405/new-game-network)** - [Alex Varankou](https://opencritic.com/critic/2669/alex-varankou) - [74 / 100](https://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/2851/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Another solid entry for the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers a wonderfully rendered natural world, though it's not as unique as it once could have been. The typical mix of stealth and action gameplay is still enjoyable and is now split between two protagonists, though switching between them can be cumbersome. Fans of the franchise should be satisfied, if not exactly impressed.\n\n-------------\n\n**[NextPlay](https://opencritic.com/outlet/897/nextplay)** - [Jamie Briggs](https://opencritic.com/critic/10648/jamie-briggs) - [8 / 10](https://next-play.com.au/assassins-creed-shadows-review-dont-lose-your-head/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a great entry in the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise and a perfect entry point for newcomers. Its dual protagonists are fantastic and distinct, and while the villains are forgettable, the personal stories of Naoe and Yasuke help deliver a strong narrative. Shadows is visually stunning, with excellent cinematography, beautiful open world, a unique soundtrack and immersive sound design. However, a sparse open world, inconsistent parkour, and a disappointing hideout system, ultimately keep it from reaching true greatness.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Sam Aberdeen](https://opencritic.com/critic/4725/sam-aberdeen) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-assassins-creed-shadows.html)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a formidably big game with a densely packed open-world and great stealth gameplay that should please fans, even if it feels like Ubisoft's formula is starting to wear a bit thin.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Noisy Pixel](https://opencritic.com/outlet/711/noisy-pixel)** - [Azario Lopez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2507/azario-lopez) - [9.5 / 10](https://noisypixel.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is a breathtaking evolution of the open-world formula, blending masterful storytelling, refined stealth mechanics, and stunning visuals. With a gripping dual-protagonist narrative and meticulously crafted historical setting, Ubisoft delivers one of the most immersive Assassin\u2019s Creed experiences to date.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Chris Garcia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8410/chris-garcia) - [8.5 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-ps5-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a notable achievement from Ubisoft, offering an experience that both long-time fans and newcomers are likely to appreciate. This latest addition to the franchise is visually stunning, and its refined stealth systems and other enhancements make it one of the best Assassin's Creed games in recent memory.\n>\n>However, the dual-protagonist approach might prove to be divisive. While the concept is innovative, its execution falters in certain areas. The game seems predominantly tailored to Naoe, whose abilities allow her to fully engage with nearly all aspects of gameplay.

Its only flaw is its inability to put Yasuke on the same level as his companion, a minor thing when so many other elements make it a must-have for those interested in the series or the setting.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pixel Arts](https://opencritic.com/outlet/740/pixel-arts)** - [Danial Dehghani](https://opencritic.com/critic/3729/danial-dehghani) - *Persian* - [9 / 10](https://www.pixelarts.ir/review/ac-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is one of the best entries in the series in the past decade.

Born from a shared mission, their partnership forces them to combine their skills, with Naoe excelling in stealth and precision while Yasuke dominates in direct confrontations. The game offers a refreshing gameplay with an immersive story set in a beautiful setting of the coveted feudal Japan. While the AI \u200b\u200bstill has its shortcomings, such as guards not reacting to nearby attacks, Ubisoft seems to have finally found the right direction for the franchise after a series of disappointing titles, ensuring that both veterans and newcomers will find something to enjoy in this Japanese adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PowerUp!](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-)** - [Leo Stevenson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson) - [7.5 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2025/03/19/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ps5-lets-senggoku/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is not a bad game, but it is a flawed one. It's also a beautiful one, an interesting one, a frustrating one, a janky one, a thrilling one and sometimes even a great one. It's a game undone by its own desire to be multiple things all at once.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Quest Daily](https://opencritic.com/outlet/905/quest-daily)** - [Julian Price](https://opencritic.com/critic/10683/julian-price) - [9 / 10](https://questdaily.com.au/review/review-assassins-creed-shadows-ps5/)\n\n>\"Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows doesn\u2019t just capture Feudal Japan \u2014 it immerses you in it.

While some of its elements are a welcome sight, the gatekeeping can feel very offputting at times if you just want to soldier on through the main story. Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is best played when you have a lot of time on your hands to play it.

The detailed open-world of feudal Japan feels full of life with compelling playable and non-playable characters, and different fighting tactics enrich the combat. But the game struggles to balance its two playable protagonists, and player choices are still inconsequential.

Whether sneaking through shadows as Noae or charging headfirst into battle as Yasuke, the game offers a dynamic experience making every choice feel consequential. With its immersive setting, refined combat mechanics, and an innovative weather system affecting gameplay, Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows elevates the franchise in ways that will leave eager players wanting for more. While Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows might follow some familiar gameplay tropes, its execution is far from formulaic. With a wealth of side content, a customisable hideout system, and the promise of a world teeming with historical intrigue and fierce battles, it is clear Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is poised to be one of the franchise's most memorable and impactful titles. Fans old and new alike will find much to love in this stunning and daring chapter in the Assassin\u2019s Creed saga.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Kieron Verbrugge](https://opencritic.com/critic/4101/kieron-verbrugge) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Ubisoft's big, bold swing with Assassin's Creed Shadows mostly connects, proving that it was right to hold off on the Hail Mary Feudal Japan setting until it had honed the series' RPG trappings. Shadows' attempts at new ideas don't all land the same, but it excels in the areas that matter most in these games with a gorgeous, rich and well-researched world to explore, compelling stealth gameplay and a story full of intrigue and fresh takes on historical figures.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Redmond Carolipio](https://opencritic.com/critic/291/redmond-carolipio) - [7.7 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/3/18/reviews/145474-ps5-review-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>I do, however, enjoy that there's still so much for me to do in Assassin's Creed: Shadows. I'm whittling down a short list of raiders known for terrorizing villages during winter and looking into members of a mysterious group \u2026 one of whom I killed while I was on the way to do something else. I also have a lot of a fogged-up map that I would still like to clear up and explore, whether it's to find some lost pages floating around a temple or engage in a meditative minigame to unlock more of Naoe's story. For an experience that featured so much conflict, it's a rare moment of peace.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XGN.nl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/810/xgn-nl)** - [Luuc ten Velde](https://opencritic.com/critic/8359/luuc-ten-velde) - *Dutch* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.xgn.nl/review/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>With Assassin's Creed Shadows, Ubisoft sticks to a familiar formula but executes it brilliantly. Add to that the new weather and season systems, along with the expanded base-building mechanics, and we\u2019re convinced that waiting for an Assassin\u2019s Creed set in Japan was more than worth it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Tavern](https://opencritic.com/outlet/949/xbox-tavern)** - [Ian Wray](https://opencritic.com/critic/11183/ian-wray) - [9.6 / 10](https://www.xboxtavern.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is everything I wanted from the series and more. The world is stunning, the combat is thrilling, and the dual-protagonist system adds so much variety to gameplay. Playing as both characters sometimes feels like experiencing two different games, thanks to their unique playstyles. The deep storytelling kept me completely immersed, and I never once felt bored. For me, it\u2019s an absolute must-play for any fan of the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9.5 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>AC Shadows is the best game in what has been an incredible series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ZTGD](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd)** - [Terrence Johnson](https://opencritic.com/critic/8293/terrence-johnson) - [9 / 10](https://ztgd.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-xsx/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Zoomg](https://opencritic.com/outlet/478/zoomg)** - [Meysam Khalilzadeh](https://opencritic.com/critic/3549/meysam-khalilzadeh) - *Persian* - [9.5 / 10](https://www.zoomg.ir/game-review/404322-assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows has all the necessary features to create an unforgettable experience of adventure as a shinobi and a powerful samurai. Ubisoft Quebec, considering everything that frustrated players in the Assassin's Creed games after Origins, immerses players in Feudal Japan. The game has extraordinary graphics, which are considered the best among all Ubisoft games to date. The game's music, combined well with the story, engages you even more in discovering the truth.\n\n-------------",

Where the missions can be similar but you don\u2019t care because getting to them is such a joy. Asasssins Creed had that but I felt lost it in Origins where free running and social stealth took a backseat.

It just keeps going and going.....and going and going.  And so much of the side-questing you're doing is so utterly inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, and rarely amounts to anything more than \"go here and kill these guys...now go here and kill this guy.\"  And if that wasn't bad enough, the *unbelievably* long travel times basically make the game take 2-3 times longer than it should because I'm literally running across the entire island for 60-70% of a quest.\n\nI think I played that game for a total of \\~120 hours, and by hour 50 or 60 all of the thrill of the game had essentially evaporated, and I was just going through the motions to wrap things up.  Contrast that with a game like Elden Ring, where my first playthrough was roughly 150 hours, and I immediately started a new playthrough with a different build, and at the moment I have well over 400 hours in that game.  AC games (and most open-world Ubisoft games, for that matter) have this tendency to rely on quantity instead of variety when it comes to exploration and quests.  I liken modern AC games to going on an 8-hour car ride and just listening to same 15-song playlist the entire time.  Sure, the first few listens are great, but it eventually loses its luster and becomes background noise.",

After about 50~ hours I just wanted the main story to be over with already and I had no energy left to do the side content.\n\nIf you're someone who only gets a new game a few times a year, if that, you'd probably see it as a huge positive for bang for buck. For me I just felt combat became comically easy, stealth was meaningless, and I was far too overpowered for whatever else the game had in store for me.\n\nThe main problem is of the 50 hours I played, I remember maybe 10. And that holds true for a lot of these sorts of games, as soon as I put the controller down I will entirely forget everything because it's not especially memorable in design.\n\nLast long open world game I played like that was Cyberpunk 2077, which after (many) patches I finally got around to playing this year and was hooked end to end and will remember most of it for a very long time.",

But if the game *hadn't* given the choice, like for example, every AC game before Syndicate, then literally nobody would have cared and we see games with female protagonists sell without hindrance. To this day, AC has *never* given its female characters that same opportunity and they have *always* chosen to make it a \"choice\". (In the main series at least, spinoff games have done it).\n\nIf they make an AC game with a sole female protagonist (no choice) and it's a great game but inexplicably sells notably worse, alright then let's talk. But they've never done that in a main game.\n\nYou cant compare \"in a game where people had to play as a man, 100% of people played as a man, BUT in the game where they had a CHOICE it was 2/3!!!\". Because if they make a game with a woman as the lead, then oh look! 100% of people played as a girl! \n\nAnyway, the issue is further reaching than Odyssey.\n\nSyndicate was intended to be a 50/50 split Jacob and Evie, execs forced them to make it 80/20 and make Jacob the focus on the marketing.\n\nOrigins was in early stages intended to have Bayek die and the rest of the game would focus on his wife Aya. Execs forced them to drop that so Aya has 3-4 playable missions throughout the story only.\n\nOdyssey was intended to be Kassandra and execs forced them to add Alexios as playable. The marketing department also featured Alexios more prominently.\n\nValhalla was written knowing they would be forced to make a \"choose your character's gender\" thing, but they deliberately wrote a woman lead who is reincarnated with the soul of a man inside her head as a competing personality. Marketing ignored this and focused almost entirely on the \"male Eivor\" (we only saw the actual main character first on the preorder bonus statue on the website)",

You're right.  You can.  Technically there's a lot of things you can do in games.  You can play first person shooters without headshots.  Nobody's stopping you.\n\nI think my point and the point of the person you're replying to is...what does it matter?  As that person (and *many* others have said), the game works best when you control Naoe, and seems to be built around her as the main feature and Yasuke as more of a gimmick.  The game actively (and directly) disincentives you from play a certain way.  Sure you *can*...but that not really a constructive way to approach criticism.\n\nBut if you are just here for the semantics and clearing up misconceptions, then sure.  Yeah.

For me, the series is a solid, good time in a historical open world. I love history and I am The Open World Defender, so mixing the two is fun for me. I'm self aware enough to know they're never *really* pushing boundaries or breaking new ground, and that's what you need to do to earn those 90+ scores.\n\nThe exception was AC2. AC2 genuinely *did* feel groundbreaking when it came out, in a way that AC1 did not (genuinely find AC1 to be one of the worst in the series, bottom 3 with Syndicate and AC3 for me). It absolutely earned its status as a classic when it released and I think people forget that too easily thanks to the annualized releases the series had for most of the 2010s.",

Brotherhood introduced finisher combos which basically ruined the combat and they've never quite got back on track. Revelations had the same issue as Brotherhood. AC3, Black Flag, and Victory all have super spongy enemies and much longer TTK, which hurts them. Unity (between BF and Victory) briefly experiments with weightier, more deliberate, more punishing combat (rather than spongy enemies) which I think is sort of better on paper but in hand it feels sort of sluggish, so they never used it again. The RPG games since then (Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla) are so intensely stat-oriented that it's almost hard to tell if the combat is good or bad, which itself is a bad thing.

But if you approach it expecting the gameplay of Odyssey, you\u2019ll be disappointed. I think there is a lot to love in this game, especially for AC fans looking for a return to a more slow and methodical approach to stealth. But I remain concerned that by splitting the main character into two, neither of the characters feel properly capable.\"",

But for some reason, all those attempts are games that either don\u2019t sell as well, or just get abandoned by Ubisoft because they don\u2019t make EVERY PENNY IN THE WORLD!\n\nSome great games they have made:\n\nPrince of Persia (the Sands of Time and Lost crown specifically. Though the others are also good).\n\nDriver San Francisco (this game is phenominal)\n\nBeyond Good and Evil.\n\nSplinter Cell (all of them.)\n\nMario Rabbids (an actually really good XCOM knockoff)\n\nAnd pretty much every major Rayman Game (2D and 3D).\n\nWhat pisses me off more than anything, is that Ubisoft are sitting on these amazing IP\u2019s but just don\u2019t DO anything with them. Even when they finally gave Prince of Persia another try and cranked out one of the best games in years, they pretty much never advertised it. So people barely knew what it was, and those that did, just did what they do for EVERY Ubisoft game, and waited 3 months for a 75% off sale :(\n\nI just wish they would stop putting ALL their eggs in the assassins creed/far cry basket and try some other stuff. I know the crew and rainbow 6 exist, but those just feel like live services that were thrown out to get a foot in the genre (and both of these have far more successful rivals in the same genres anyway), rather than labours of love that Ubisofts best games have been.",

You can't even find half of them without being *really* near there. Many of them aren't copy-pasted generic building but it almost feel like a side-detour you normally find only in open-ended world like God of War.\n\nOn top of that is the fact that everything you find in the game will be 'useful,' in some way. No number or colored loot. Everything you find progress the character and unlock things that actually feels new. It actually encourage you to explore more and more. Though you can absolutely finish the game without ever engaging any of them. \n\nThis is why I considered Outlaws the best open world Ubisoft games in the last 5 years. It actually make you want to do map icon and feel rewarding! And the fact that games like AC Valhalla get better review is *baffling*!",

Quest design/exploration is also a lot more based on talking to npcs or just seeing cool shit in the distance vs the checklist style. It also eschews a traditional level system with the constant gradual xp rewards in favour of a challenge-type system (eg get 20 grenade kills to get an upgrade to grenade shit)\n\nIt is ultimately a Ubisoft game at the end of the day, and you can tell. Wouldn\u2019t call it a fundamental departure in that way, but it was a considerable refinement that addressed a lot of the common criticisms imo.",

Also by having 4 planets instead of one big map, it felt smaller and more dense (I loved exploring the cities). The combat was more stealth focused, and it also included a lot of Uncharted style action sequences. \n\n\nPlus they had the whole factions system which meant you did jobs for one of them, it could piss of another. So you'd get exclusive factions rewards and quests etc (although it was easy to cheese the system and get all 3 factions to like you.)\n\n\nI enjoyed it. Not amazing, but really captured the feeling of Star Wars. Worth getting now that it's always on sale and a lot of the bugs have been fixed.",

So at some point I just gave up, upgraded the rapid-fire blaster and tried to see how many stormtroopers per minute I can headshot.\n\nThe answer is \"a lot\". The AI has absolutely no idea how to use their environment and will for the most part bullrush you or peek from cover without moving. I don't think they know how to flank or provide covering fire. The only ones that really put up any resistance are the black troopers from Rogue One, because they can take a bit more punishment, shoot faster, and will probably hit you back. Still, with smart use of chokepoints and grenades, you can alert any enemy camp and then just pew-pew them to death like it's Gears of War. At least until AT-ST shows up, then the fun is over.\n\nOverall, a very basic combat system that I didn't like much. I might drop back and see whether they fixed stealth - because I could see how that stealth could be fun, if only it worked. And the setting and the vibes in that game are just great.",

It's why their sequels tend to be so incremental and incompetent in changes, and often backwards or delayed, because they don't really look at or care what others are doing.\n\nThe only time they do examine other games are when those games are successful (like Witcher 3 or BotW) and it comes as an order from the top, in which case they don't really play the game  so much as take it apart; only concerned with how it works instead of why it works.\n\nIt's why you see the most creativity from Ubi's satellite studios.  \n\nIt's funny to see a company like Nintendo's senior division of old-school games disappear as the new generation of directors come in with more finance and accounting backgrounds.

Reddit arguing about 80s games being \"shit\" so much recently is really skewing the whole review score issues even more than they already were.\n\nIt was already bad enough that review scores are all compressed in the 60-100 range as it is... but we're getting into the territory now where any game that is below like an 88 is considered \"mid\" or something by Reddit which is absurd.\n\n80 Metacritic games are still still really good games. Folks are obviously free not to like them--just like they are free not to like 90 Metacritic games, for that matter--but this mentality that an 82 is a \"huge disappointment\" is just absurdly unrealistic standards now.\n\n(Let's also not forget that AC: Odyssey--which is generally spoken about as one of Ubisoft's best games and is very popular also had \"only\" an 84 OpenCritic score...)\n\nSure, when a game is in the mid-70s it's in the space where it's starting to get to the point of, \"yeah, this could have used a little more work...\" but anything in the 80s is typically a very enjoyable game for anyone who finds that type of game fun. The practical gap from a player experience between an 82 and 92 game these days is often in hype more than substance and nitpicking over flaws that don't really take much away from the overall experience.\n\nDon't have an option about Assassin's Creed specifically yet, but seeing these review threads descend into madness about every single 82-84 Metacritic game over the last year is getting a little silly. There are probably a small handful of games that can't afford to have a score in the 80s, but for most of the industry 80 is a successful launch.",

Nothing significant will be wrong. Nothing monumental will happen that makes you think it was the best game you have played. It will probably be a fun (if you like the genre) and relatively polished experience that doesn't knock anyone's socks off.\n\nThat's pretty much what to expect going into all of them. You know what you're getting here. I'm honestly surprised so many people hyped this game as if it was going to be some monumental failure or buggy mess.

I don't have too much problem with Valhalla's length since I'm not bothered by long games, and actually I really liked its story structure (each region is a self-contained story, so they each feel like a single season of a broader overall TV show), but the RPG/leveling mechanics and loot system really were not the right fit for Assassin's Creed IMO, and early medieval England is nowhere near as interesting a setting as ancient Greece or Hellenistic/Roman Egypt. Fortunately, medieval Japan is far closer to the latter two as a setting and the loot mechanics of Shadows are closer to Odyssey, so I'm optimistic.",

Yeah. Nothing but interminable bitching about missing when assassins were assassins and not RPG characters, and how the game is too long, and how it's too big and it would be better if it was more focused and linear like the old games. The studio literally takes this advice to heart and makes a game based around doing these things and it's the worst reviewed, worst selling game in the series in like a decade.",
