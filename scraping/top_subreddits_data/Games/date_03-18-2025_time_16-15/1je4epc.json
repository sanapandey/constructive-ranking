While the core gameplay remains as deep and rewarding as ever, some of its rougher edges, like clunky menus, a steep learning curve, and persistent pop-in, keep it from feeling as polished as Monolith Soft's later work. Newcomers will find a daunting but fascinating journey, whereas returning fans can enjoy the extra content without reinventing the experience. It might not be the series's classic, but if you can embrace its complexity and occasional frustrations, Mira is still an open-world marvel.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-de-review/)\n\n>Xenoblade Chronicles X is an ambitious and sprawling RPG that excels in exploration, world-building, and strategic combat.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Steven Mills](https://opencritic.com/critic/10000/steven-mills) - [10 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/)\n\n>Monolith Soft went the extra mile and added meaningful new content and quality-of-life features that actually improved on what was already a masterpiece experience. The Definitive Edition treatment makes Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition one of the best JRPGs on the Switch, and a must-play for fans of the genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/37136)\n\n>Despite its streamlined gameplay mechanics, the \u201cDefinitive Edition\u201d of \u201cXenoblade Chronicles X\u201d is still a very complex and sometimes exhausting game. But if you invest the necessary time and energy in the title, you will be rewarded with countless magical goosebump moments.\n>\n>The fantastically beautiful sci-fi game world is full of dangers and surprises. The addictive combat system offers an incredible amount of flexibility and variety. And the massive mechs are one of the coolest things I've ever had the pleasure of controlling in a game. In short: \u201cXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition\u201d is one of the best role-playing games and one of the best Switch games of all time.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Benjamin Braun](https://opencritic.com/critic/4867/benjamin-braun) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/xenoblade-chronicles-xde/test/review-maAh/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Sebastian Kasparek](https://opencritic.com/critic/3746/sebastian-kasparek) - *Polish* - [9 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-gry-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-jrpg-prawd/z546ef)\n\n>Xenoblade Chronicles X was a very ambitious game that debuted on a practically dying console. But right now you can confidently say that you have found a perfect example of a game ahead of its time. This definitive edition not only shows the strength of the series, but jRPG genre as a whole.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/nintendo-switch/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-a-skell-above-the-rest/)\n\n>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is a reminder that X is one of the best entries in Xenoblade despite its differences. It's a weird and wonderful game that stands out in a franchise filled with bangers. This version doubles down on its strengths and supplements some of its weaknesses to make for the best version of X, and is a must buy for any JRPG fanatic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saudi Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer)** - *Arabic* - [8 / 10](https://www.saudigamer.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/)\n\n>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition offers an immersive experience for fans of open-world RPGs, with a massive world and engaging combat system, along with significant improvements to the graphics and user interface. Despite some minor flaws, the improvements and additions make it an experience well worth your time and attention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [TJ Denzer](https://opencritic.com/critic/331/tj-denzer) - [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/143507/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-score)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-recensione)\n\n>Xenoblade Chronicles X was the last missing piece to recreate the whole quadrilogy of Xenoblade Games on Nintendo Switch, and this Definitive Edition makes it justice. The team worked on most of the things that didn't work so well in the original (an already great game) and made it viable for both newcomers and old-time fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Dominic Leighton](https://opencritic.com/critic/307/dominic-leighton) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/)\n\n>With a smattering of improvements as it jumps to Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition offers up an epic sci-fi tale set in one of the very best open worlds.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Kieron Verbrugge](https://opencritic.com/critic/4101/kieron-verbrugge) - [9 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review/)\n\n>The underdog in Monolith Soft's Xenoblade Chronicles series has never looked or played better, giving new life to a game that could have been destined to rot in the ill-fated WiiU's library. By boldly refitting its systems and gently touching up the already-beautiful art, along with adding some welcome chunks of all-new content, this Definitive Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X is essential playing for fans new and old.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XGN.nl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/810/xgn-nl)** - [Simon Kwee](https://opencritic.com/critic/10198/simon-kwee) - *Dutch* - [9 / 10](https://www.xgn.nl/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review/)\n\n>Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition is a true joy to play, in no small part thanks to quality of life improvements in the UI, and gameplay tweaks that streamline the experience significantly. Add to that the new story content that clears up several loose ends of the original and you have a certified must-play for fans and newcomers alike.\n\n-------------",

Especially Sylvalum really sells the idea of this being an alien world and completely foreign to us. Its nice its no longer stuck to just a dead console and emulation",

Xenoblade 1 actually forces the player to interact or adapt to the enemy and their moves to interrupt instead of just setting up a one shot.  While there is the Topple locking for end game, it's not as if spamming buffs to setting up a topple spike chain attack is any better.  The issue with 2 (not torna) and 3 is that this becomes the only strategy as enemy HP is massively inflated so new players are forced into long battles or doing spikes/smashes themselves.\n\n\nAs for X, I'd say it's just weaker since it's not linear at all and some things are extremely confusing on how the calculation is done like how defense literally just blocks one damage per point which means it's a completely useless stat or how one of the skills actually multiplies your end damage (forgot the name) and is far superior to the other skills.  The appendages and secondarys are really cool but my complaint is since X isn't linear, the game either isn't challenging enough or is too hard depending on what side stuff has been explored so most people won't get as smooth of combat experience as they would in 1-3.",

XC3 inflates HP so hard that boss battles are terrible for newer players and a bore for players once they know how to set up the same chain attack launch spike every single fight.  Xenoblade 3 has one fight where you actually look at the enemy moves (CH3? consul boss) and the rest is just playing setup similar to XC2 where you one shot before the engage happens. \n\nAnd the reason why I think X combat is terrible is because the game doesn't know the player's equips/skills/classes so battles are either oneshot by skell weapons or the player gets screwed when they're suddenly on foot with no updated equipment.  Outside of the super bosses, the combat is unbalanced because of the ability to use Skells/different class mixups and the devs won't know the general power level of the player at any point outside the start of the game.  While I think X is amazing in exploration/sidequests, it's combat is the most unbalanced in the series.",

Whereas someone with outright disinterest or even disdain for a genre or game is simply going to make a review that is worthless to both enthusiasts and newcomers alike. I can think of a few over the years where that was clearly the case and the reviews stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\nIn an ideal world you'd have some neutral individuals as well who can give some insight on how the game serves as an entry to the genre or as someone who knows a surface level amount of information at the very least. A decent number of fighting game reviews have such people brought in so they can experience how new players view the game and give their thoughts on it, alongside someone who is more knowledgeable.\n\ntl;dr a review written by an enthusiast still has some value even if only to other enthusiasts. A review written by someone who dislikes the genre going in and doesn't magically have their mind changed is worthless to _everyone_.",

Itemization is lowkey an absolute mess in this game despite there being like 38 different attributes.  And, lastly, combat is sometimes a little baffling/frustrating (sort of like XC2 *can* be, but even then it lacks the rhythm that made XC2 make sense as you got deeper into the game).\n\nTL;DR go into it with vibes and you'll have fun.  Go into it thinking its systems will be as intuitive as the other XC games... and you may have a bad time.",

Early game combat went from slow and methodical to spamming arts and tons more healing from soul voices if you choose to use it.\n\nThere's all these options you have with thinking of builds with skills, arts, augments, equipment load outs on all your party members but really it doesn't matter for 99.9% of the game. You can just quickly zoom past everything auto equip or ignore. It would feel better if the game challenged you and you had to think and try to synergize your party\n\nI don't know, monolith just sucks at game testing balance. Xeno 3 experience gain was so stupid high even when you don't use any camp exp I felt like I was ruining the game by exploring and doing all side content with overleveling. oh god I just remembered in XB3 how by default you can overkill in chain attacks and it just super overlevels you so you have to turn that off in settings or something, bizarre decisions",

I love the setting and characters of 1 and I actually got fairly far into 3, but I did so much side questing that I significantly overlevelled the main story which made combat feel a bit boring.\n\nI played X back on the Wii U and didn't get far into it at all, a shame since I love open world games and this seems a pretty good one. Shame there isn't a demo or something since I'm not sure if I feel like dropping full price to see once again if it the series clicks with me this time.",

The game still gets too easy eventually unfortunately, but it takes until kinda endgame (or I guess \"late-midgame\" is a more specific way to put it) to do so. Xenoblade X is easier than Hard Mode XB3 unfortunately, especially with the new Quick Cooldown mechanic they're adding, and X does not have a Hard Mode option. Although I remember X at least being harder than Normal Mode XB3 which was **waaaayyy** too easy.\n\nHard Mode Xenoblade **2** is the Xenoblade game where (except for postgame, of course) combat stays challenging throughout the entire game. Although unfortunately the combat in that game is not explained well at all...(fingers crossed for a Xenoblade 2 Definitive Edition).",

            "body": "I am curious of how much they improved on the gameplay since the wii U version.\n\nThe wii U version was difficult to understand: coming from xenoblade chronicles where gear stats were easy to understand (you had the classical strength, defense against physical attacks, magic and so on), gear in xenoblade chronicles was next to impossible for me to understand (you had weakness against gravity attacks for examples => ok, how do i know what attacks are gravity ? You have no clues during fights and not much more in the bestiary). I couldn't for the life of me telling if this random rare piece of gear of level X was better or worse than this random legandary piece of gear of level Y.\n\nCombat on skell (the big robots) was, as far as i practiced the game, limited to spamming attacks and waiting for cooldowns. Perhaps there is more but when i searched on the xenoblade chronicles X sub, i didn't find anything. Everyone agrees that piloting skells are awesome but the impression i got from reading the sub was that on foot combat was better.\n\nCombat on foot had indeed much more depth but quickly became centered around mastering overdrive. I did my homework and looked at youtube videos and read the user manual to understand the system => basically, you had to select skills and play them in an order that would both extend your damage and the duration of overdrive. \n\nSo at its core, in the same way that xenoblade chronicles was centered around inflicting topple status and using the monado arts, xenoblade chronicles X seemed to be centered around overdrive if you are meant to truly master combat => all the videos i saw of people taking out huge monster sized monsters in their underwear was centered around overdrive.\n\n...but i never managed to make it click. Combat on skell was effective but not very fun while on foot, i felt very weak without overdrive. Worse, it felt to me that some class were much better as setting up combos and overdrive and that once, you have a good combo set up, you could play it the same against a random monster lvl5 or a big boss => as long as you were executing the action sequence with a right timing, it didn't seem to matter what your opponent was.\n\nSame for teammates, they only felt like skill containers meant to set up combos while i felt that they mattered much more in xenoblade chronicles.\n\nIt might feel like a rant but I am not trying to hate the game, i haven't played it in 8 years but it is one that is still frustrating to me years later as i keep hearing from its fan crowd how it is such a hidden gem. And yet, i didn't manage to get to the good part of it.\n\nI liked xenoblade chronicles, i liked it a lot and i wish i would be able to enjoy X as much as others did and still do. Unitl now, it felt like i am being locked outside of the party.",

Echoes of Wisdom came out last year so it's too soon for another new 2D entry. So if they do a Zelda release at all this year I would presume it would be a remaster.\n\nI personally think they'd do Twilight Princess HD first because like XCX it released on Wii U but didn't sell well as they came along later when it was already in the toilet. Wind Waker had more time in the sun. I suspect one of the two might release this year but its also possible they just skip this year.",
