    "selftext": "I've been watching the recent videos of Yooka Replayee, and the game does look like a significant improvement from the original release. I know a lot of people wanted to see a sequel instead, but I don't think it's a bad idea to get the original game up the standard it needed to be at first.\n\nThis did get me wondering though. It's a sentiment that I've heard a fair bit in this remake era that game companies should be remaking games that weren't considered classics, because those are the games that could be improved upon. This does beg the question though, are there any examples of this in practice?\n\nThe closest one I can think of is Crash Nitro Kart. That was a game that was significantly worse than Crash Team Racing in every way, but for that game's remake, all the Nitro Kart tracks and characters were included, finally allowing players to race them with CTR's brilliant racing mechanics.\n\nI can't think of any other examples though. Are there any others? And I'm talking about official remakes by the way. Project 06 doesn't count.",

I had never been more disappointed by a Kingdom Hearts game, except maybe Dream Drop Distance and KH3.\n\nRe:Coded was actually really good, even if it was a bastardized regurgitation of the first Kingdom Hearts game with about half the worlds. I'll also give Re:Coded credit for being the only Kingdom Hearts spinoff that is completely and utterly unnecessary to play in order to understand the complete mindfuck that is the overall plot.\n\nI'm sorry but an RPG enthusiast shouldn't have to spend thousands of dollars on handheld games consoles and spinoff titles just to understand the convoluted plot of the main series games. And Kingdom Hearts was up there with the likes of Mega Man and Guitar Hero for the most overmilked franchise in history.",

How you can say that when Riku clearly has a arc from kingdom hearts 1 to dream drop distance about forgiving himself. Or how nobodies/Roxas story are clearly a metaphor for growning up, finding your identity and seperate from your friends as you grow old. Nomura said as much that was based on his chilhood lol. Even ReCoded has whole segment about understading someone else hurt connects to them.. It isn't deep or complex, but there's some nuance beyond power of friendship.",

But later on it's explain that a nobody slowling start to regrow a heart and start to feel again, which makes sense since we see that happen in 358/2 days. Roxas start as zombie (or as a kid) basically and by the end of it , it learn to act like a human.. He grows up from a little kid and pass through purberty , [there's whole joke about ''pressing the wrong button'' with girls](https://lparchive.org/Kingdom-Hearts-3582-Days-%28by-1234567890num%29/Update%2039/79-tower_2.png).. \n\n> but they are stronger than heartless? \n\nIt doesn't matter really. Heartless and Nobodies are two part of one person. They need to be reconnected to exist again as a full human. \n\n>And depsite being an incredibly important character structure and making characters from previous games actually be nobodies they aren't mentioned until halfway through the canon\n\nNobodies are introduced in kh1 and COM tho.\n\n>Is it though? The concept of forgiving yourself hinged entirely on his willingness to accept the help of his friends.\n\nHis willingness to accept that he worth and deserve help from his friends.. Something that he's only capable of doing after having his journey in KHCOM and 2 , where he learns how to forgive himself from all his mistakes in KH1.\n\nEdit: Again not saying that KH is somehow deep and complex. But there's some themes and nuances that you can notice if you think beyond the ''Power of the friendship.''",

In my earlier comment  I tried to show that as an analogy for growing up the level of abstraction needed to get through what was a painfully shallow metaphor to begin with, you had to engage with an unbearable level of self inconsistent world rules, which was my original point.  They are engaging with the game on its own terms and that clearly they are very invested in it.  If i engage in that regard, it would be like me trying to convince a believer that the bible isn't true by pointing out it's not self consistent.  All i'm going to do i annoy them further and waste my time.  I'm glad the game means stuff to people. that's the joy of art.  Once it's out there everyone gets their own take.",

I had held that line as I had played them as they came out and would be like, no no there's a deeper and more interesting story here, you just have to know it, because in death by sleep or dream drop etc etc....  But playing all of the games back to back was the worst thing possible for appreciation of the story.  It's utterly stupid. The world building rules are not self consistent at all, the characters reset constantly so that the game can have an emotional through line and unless you see it as an avant garde art piece on the nature of emotional dependence on corporate consumerist IP, thoroughly vapid.",

Arthur Brown was basically the original \"your favorite band's favorite band\" type of artist - avant garde, kind of weird artists who don't really care about mainstream success but are beloved by their contemporary artists, see also the Butthole Surfers - but he managed to get a random ass hit song with that Fire song there. \n\nFrom there, he influenced generations of shock rockers and future metalheads with his proto-black metal makeup and embrace of occult aesthetics, but musically still *basically* sounds like any other 60s rock band, and it makes it all seem a bit ridiculous to a modern listener. Here he is introducing his song by screaming about being the god of hellfire, and then it leads into... Sounding kinda like The Doors. Just based on everything until the actual instruments come in, you expect something closer to at least Mercyful Fate or even Venom, yet somehow in 1968, but then it sounds like The Doors. He was still a product of his era.\n\nIn the same way, Metroid 1 has this extraordinarily innovative sprawling Metroidvania world gated by finding various upgrades and pickups to unlock new areas and defeat new enemies, but which you can also broadly tackle in an open-ended fashion without any problem back in *1986!* But it also just kinda feels bad, since Samus can't crouch or shoot diagonally, and you have to grind out getting your health bar topped up every time you start the game again since there isn't a save system, Samus' movement is weirdly sluggish even compared to other slower/floatier Metroid games like Super Metroid, and the rooms are way too long for their own good. It's still a product of its era.",

It wasn't until *Super Metroid* that the series really came into its own (and is still the high point of the series, IMO).",

Quests and story hooks resolve themselves at designated times of day, whether the player located them and became involved or not. Without a proper translation, it was impossible in some cases to know where things were happening on the map. The hints and directions didn't make it through the translation.\n\nThe new version in 2015 fixed the bugs, provided an entirely new and brilliant translation, and overhauled the visuals without sacrificing authenticity to the art style, despite the game being titled as if it was a simple HD remaster.\n\nMetacritic's score for the game was in the low-to-mid-6s. \n\nHD Classic instead received a 76 (from 11 critics) with user scores being 8.3\n\nCuriously, the original game was scrubbed from Metacritic's website. I'm not sure why, but that sort of revisionist history does not sit well with me. I'm glad I first played it as HD Classic, as it instantly became my favorite immersive sim, but the original release should not have been erased and replaced.",

Only ever having heard that \"oh my god 2 is so incredible\" followed up with something along the lines of \"don't worry about 1, it's a different game\". But I can't imagine it was bad enough, at least financially, to ruin the opportunity for 2 to be made and blow up critically.",

In a way it's similar to Zelda II, and for the long time was the black sheep of the series.\n\nIn 2005 a remake of the game released with the title of Ys: The Oath in Felghana. Similar to Ys VI (which preceded it), it's a top-down 3D action RPG with very fast paced combat and some platforming elements. Not only does it remake Ys III but it expands upon it as well. Whereas Ys III was considered the worst game in the franchise, The Oath in Felghana might just be considered the best (though Ys VIII seems to have that reputation these days). And the game was recently ported/remastered for the Switch and PS5 under the title Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana.",

The deku walk speed, boss fight changes (especially Twinmold), and zora swimming all make the game more awkward and difficult than it was in the original.",

And whether you think the original wasn't good or not, it's one of the most beloved games of all time lol.\n\nThe issue is splitting it into three games, and in most cases people are less likely to buy a sequel than the original. People who didn't play Remake aren't going to get Rebirth, and some people who played Remake aren't going to get Rebirth, so it's basically guaranteed lower sales. As a result of the way they did it too, and obviously had some development troubles initially, it's been ten years since it was announced and it's not fully released yet. Pretty easy to see why it would be having some issues, but I hardly think it's because the gaming populous \"realized it was never good\" lol",
