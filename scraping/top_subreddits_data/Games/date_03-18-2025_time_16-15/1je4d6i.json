While when I buy a game I make an investment and am rather going to finish it. Who has time for hundreds of games anyway ? For me it just didn't work. I'm 100% back in just buying the games I want instead of having a shitty subscription.",

I would have thought PC game pass/ cloud would have been a incentive to continue to maintain the level of games being added to the service but perhaps they are not making sufficient inroads to justify the investment. On PC steam is understandably insurmountable. If they do intend on making game pass into EA play or Ubisoft plus it might at least add value to offer dlcs like those publishers do.",
