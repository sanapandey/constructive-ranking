All an attacker needs is an email address, which could have (and most likely has) been leaked in a totally separate security incident, unrelated to either EGS or Steam. An attempt on your account doesnt make either EGS or Steam insecure, in of itself. But if the service offers 2FA and thats been bypassed, that's a security hole.\n\nFor anyone who reads this, you can check how many times your email address, sometimes passwords, and other details linked to it have been leaked online by using [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) (I've had my email address for over 10 years now, and it's been leaked/involved in 19 different security breaches, twice via LinkedIn breaches, lol)\n\nI'm not sure if EGS or Steam has currently, or has previously had 2FA security holes (I'd put money on both of them having had an incident with it at least once), a quick google would probably bring up anything related to that.\n\n2FA/MFA is great generally, but what's more important is using a different password per service, and having a password that is long enough that it couldnt ever be brute forced by currently possible methods.  Ideally you want a minimum of 16 characters in your password to make them uncrackable computationally. Of course, social engineering could still get you, but there's plenty of advice out there on avoiding social engineering attacks.",
