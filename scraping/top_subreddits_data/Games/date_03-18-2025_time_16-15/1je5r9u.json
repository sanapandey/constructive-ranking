I know some people found them frustrating, but learning how to work the mechanics and the progression of traversal improvements was such an engaging gameplay loop. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this one.",

You're *still walking*, but every few minutes you can use a hovering jetpack for a long jump over a difficult section / a high upward jump for scouting the terrain / a good view over a scenic route (which aren't lacking in this game)... so many uses!  \n\nAnd then later it's time for a bigger upgrade. What now? Well give the players a mecha-like robot vehicle (not larger than the truck). This way they're *still walking*, but over longer distances, plus the rule of cool. Imagine having a mecha to fight those chiral monstrosities! Imagine crossing over a big river - almost a death sentence on foot, but manageable in a mecha. Imagine a mecha focused on combat, another one focused on stealth, another purely for traversal, or load... more options for one's style of gameplay and/or type of mission.  \n\nSo on, etc. Just keep doing increments on the walking mechanic, instead of replacing it with motorbikes and trucks.\n  \nI don't know about the ziplines, I enjoyed setting those up and just zipping around, and they aren't antithetical to the 'walking vehicles' I mentioned, they can go alongside them - like you could eventually upgrade a zipline to fit a truck-sized mecha, and use a mecha to help place ziplines.",

But alas.\n\nI'm not saying any of these things are bad BTW. I'm just coming up with alternatives to the motorbikes and trucks while keeping the focus on the walking mechanics.",

I've played it over quite a few times now, and love doing the training walls at the start too. \n\nThe climbing mechanics are really great, and you can even do speed climbing by powering through a lot of the more tenuous grips and doing jumps from spots. I can't wait to see what it's like using the inventory system and going on a proper climb.",

Did twisting my limbs in weird ways have an effect on my stamina usage? Does grabbing up really high stress my climber more? What level of incline is impossible to climb, etc.",
