            "body": "For those unaware, Path of Exile 2's next big update (which should add at least one new class, new endgame stuff and more) was scheduled for April 4th, **2 days** after LE's big Season 2 update (which people have waited months for). This was a problem because the launch window for these seasonal updates is when the game gets the most attention, hence the most players and most revenue. \n\nBecause LE and PoE 2 share a significant playerbase, this would cause the launches to essentially cannibalize each other. EHG (LE devs) are a smaller studio and would have been hit far worse by this. The fiasco caused some mild drama with people being upset at how close the launches were, wondering if GGG (makers of PoE 2) did this intentionally, and in general feeling bad for LE, the underdog.\n\nAs a result, EHG (makers of LE) have decided to delay by two weeks to give their game some breathing room. Sucks they had to do it (especially since they announced their planned launch date a full month earlier) but it's for the best. This'll give their game more attention and give players some breathing room between the two launches. Most importantly, the community was already feeling bad for them with the launch fiasco, so there should be little ill will due to a further delay.\n\nRegardless, I'm hyped as hell for LE season 2. The stuff they've shown off looks cool, especially all the endgame updates.",

That's a low bar.\n\nI've also documented that EHG has done the work to avoid this overlap, both proactively and reactively at significant cost. What else could they reasonably do?\n\nHowever, it does seem like GGG could have done more to avoid this overlap. It's clear EHG is willing to be flexible. It's likely that GGG did not tell EHG about the April 4th launch date (it's likely they were talking in December 2024 if not earlier), given that EHG clearly wants to avoid GGG's launch window and would have done that if they knew about it earlier. And GGG maybe could have launched even 1 week later -- maybe that's not possible, but EHG has delayed their launch 2 weeks on short notice and they are a small indie company.\n\nIf you want to talk about running a business, reputational risk is something businesses should think about. By picking a date 2 days after EHG's launch, GGG accepted the risk of looking like they could be stomping on a competitor. Worse, my impression is that EHG and GGG previously had a friendly relationship as well, including interacting on social media and their leaders and staff being on friendly terms.

And I am sure if we go back in time we can see how they altered their launch schedule around D3 before they were a bigger deal than D3. GGG literally said that they were working on POE2 to directly compete/surpass D4.\n\n\n>This ain't even a major update for POE2 either\n\nThis is the first major content update for POE2 since it launched. This absolutely is a big deal. They have held back on pretty much any balance changes since launch and are going to release all of that combined with new content.\n\n\n>not like it'll flood the peak player count back to starting launch numbers\n\nEL OH EL\n\n>I would have rather they give some other lame backend server excuse than this whiny boo-hoo, \"we're just small indie studio\" post.\n\nI am happy they are treating the player base like adults and being honest instead of lying to them. Not sure why you would rather be lied to.\n\n\nYour whole post reeks of someone who had no idea what they are talking about in this genre of gaming. The fact that you would **PREFER** them lying to you is just ... wow.",
