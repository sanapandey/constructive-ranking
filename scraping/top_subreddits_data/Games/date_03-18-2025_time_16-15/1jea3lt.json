Even if you haven't played it, you've seen that box art and it made you at least curious about it.\n\n\nI think it stood out mostly because PS1 games art at that time weren't so greens, blues, bright colors like N64 games. Also the fact the case for a disc was much smaller than an N64 box. So the simplicity cut through the generally busy art of its contemporaries.",
