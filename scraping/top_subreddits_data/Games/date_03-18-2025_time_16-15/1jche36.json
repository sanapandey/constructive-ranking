            "body": "Finished the **Max Payne** trilogy, and what. a. journey! They were on my backlog for ages and I finally decided to play all before the 1/2 remakes come out. Story-wise, I think I like 1>2=3. 1 was an amazing, progressive revenge fantasy that felt fresh all throughout. 2 I was less partial to, maybe because the femme fatale aspect of noir isn't one of my favorites. 3 I understand how the original fans felt is completely disjointed from the others, but to me the story was gripping and satisfying from start to finish. Gameplay-wise, the games evolved beautifully, with 1 feeling a bit dated but still very good, 2 being a much better, responsive and engaging experience, and 3 just being the pinnacle of third person shooters, a bombastic, chaotic, and brutal game. Other than 1 being a massive pain in the ass to run on a modern PC, the games run and look great in 2025! Also, for 3, what a soundtrack! I've been listening to it all day since I reached the credits. Tears has quickly become one of my favorite songs ever. \n\nMy only other thing was some more progress on **Donkey Kong Country Returns HD**, just started the Forest world and the game is as good as when I started it. Levels are starting to get challenging, and I've pretty much given up on collecting everything at least on this first run. Maybe by the end I'll want to repeat the levels where I missed things and complete the K levels and temples. \n\nI'm super, super hyped for **AC Shadows** this week.",

            "body": "**Assassin's Creed Origins**\n\nIn preparation for AC Shadows I decided to replay Origins and get the few trophies I was still missing to platinum it. (Already got platinum on Odyssey, Valhalla, and Mirage).\n\nI had forgotten just how mesmerising Ubisoft's recreation of Ptolemaic Egypt was. The fertile Nile cutting through the desert leading to the green Nile delta, combined with the Egyptian and Greek architecture really makes this setting stand out even among other AC titles. It's just a joy to ride my camel around and enjoy the views.\n\nSwitching from Bayek to Aya for a few of the story missions also got me hyped for the dual protagonists we'll get in Shadows.\n\nBayek's motivation or goals still didn't make much sense to me on replay. He flips back and forth between fighting for revenge against his son's killer and fighting for the people of Egypt. (Also we know he accidentally killed his own son, but I can chalk that up to a grieving father being in denial and feeling like the blame shouldn't be on him.)\n\nI'm super excited to see what Ubisoft can do with 16th century Japan. Just have to wait a few more days and hope the game isn't too buggy on release.",

Previous thought [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ilbjby/comment/mbuq08k/?context=3).\n\nWhat an experience, definitely looking forward for more AC from now on! The new game plus experience is very good, the amount of variation and alternatives mission that were available to choose kept it from being stale. I think one mission that gives me trouble the most is >!\"Escort Weaponized Mining Ship\"!< in NG++, as im already having trouble facing these>!bonewheel-ass enemies in Coral Convergence!< before, so when it appeared here, im was not prepared that i had to look up recommended build for my AC lol. \n\nFor Bosses, i think >!Fires of Raven ending boss, Ayre!< is my first true roadblock that took the most tries. Sure, >!CEL240 !<gave me trouble as well, but once i saw an opening that i can exploit, the fight became easy for me. >!Handler Walter!< too, but since i already had more upgrade going for my AC, i managed to easily beat it. >!ALLMIND/Iguazu !<almost made me give up, until i change my weapon to explosives that staggers it so i can punish it with my trusty lance + pile bunker combo.\n\nOverall, a damn good game, definitely recommends it.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nFinished **Ninja Gaiden 2 Black** as well. Previous thought [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1j73oj2/comment/mgvlnym/?context=3).\n\nAs i said before, overall i thought NG Sigma is the better game. Beside the graphics, i thought every aspect in this game is a downgrade from the first one. Everything felt a bit simplified. I still enjoyed it overall, as it was very smooth to play, but kinda disappointing that some aspect that i like in the first game are non existent here.\n\nThe camera still as dogshit as ever though.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nFinished **Gravity Circuit** too. Previous thought [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1j73oj2/comment/mgvlnym/?context=3).\n\nIf you're a big Megaman fan, then this game is a must play. Fantastic game throughout, loved the artstyle, loved the music, fantastic level design and bosses, and surprisingly enjoyable story as well. The gameplay with all the upgrades and enhancements, is just so tight to play. Easy recommends !",

            "body": "**Drova - Forsaken Kin**  \n2D pixel action RPG with a dark Celtic mythology setting. Heavily inspired by the Gothic series.  \nI did (I think?) everything in ~50 hours. PC.\n\nWhat a wonderful experience this was.  \nDrova throws you into its unforgiving world with plenty of freedom. Meaning it allows you to screw up and it will punish you for it, though that's not always a game over: Just like in the big inspiration, getting defeated by a human enemy will usually mean you're just getting robbed, not killed.  \n\nBut let's start at the beginning:  \nIn the intro, your tribe finds a glowing red crystal which two druids sneak out of town to open the path to the mystical Land of Legends: Drova. You secretly follow but things don't go to plan and now your stranded in Drova. The first thing you see is a destroyed village with a deadly fog encroaching on it. The Land of Legends might not live up to its promise and you've got to figure out how to survive here and what to do with that crystal.  \nFrom there on, you do pretty typical RPG things. You explore the map, fight beasts, pick up everything that's not nailed down, and meet NPCs. But throughout it all, there is a constant sense of danger, if not hostility. Even your earliest explorations will lead you to odd devices in various ruins and have you encounter enemies that you can't yet hope to defeat. Knowing when to run away (or past) foes is definitely part of the learning curve. As is figuring out who you can trust. Because several ostensible quest givers don't exactly have your best interests in mind.  \n\nI really enjoyed exploring the fairly intricate map with its winding paths and many dead ends because almost all of them have something neat to find. Whenever you don't have a weapon drawn, you can investigate objects in your surroundings by holding right click and mousing over them. That nets you access to hidden stashes or lets you read ancient inscriptions to learn about the world, spot a hidden passage, or figure out a puzzle. The actual navigation can be a bit tricky with how the map is laid out: Just because you can see a place doesn't mean it's quick and easy to get to. Though you can unlock some ways to help with traversal later on.  \nAs for combat, the basics aren't that deep. You've got your basic and power attacks, the latter of which needs stamina. So does the dodge and (with a shield) block. You soon unlock various special attacks and later spells that all requires Focus which you can generate via regular attacks. While there aren't a ton of enemy types, each one acts notably unique in attack patterns, abilities, and movement. Unless you're overgeared, any enemy attack will take a good chunk of your health. Not having any base health regeneration makes every point of damage you take matter. All this keeps you on your toes, making the combat tense. Especially when fighting 3+ enemies at once.\n\nAs far as progression goes, gear is very important. You only deal minimal damage and take a ton if your equipment isn't up to snuff. But armor in particular is hard to come by.  \nQuests and enemies give experience, earning of which enough gets you a level up that, in turn, nets you Learning Points. You can spend those to improve your stats or learn new combat and non-combat abilities. But only if you find someone who will actually train you.  \nThere is also a crafting system in Drova but you don't really have to engage with it outside of a few side quests. It mostly lets you make consumables like meals, healing slaves, traps, and arrows as well as the occasional permanent accessory.  \nEating and sleeping aren't mechanically mandatory but they're the easiest ways to heal up.\n\nThe dialogue and quests paint a picture of a pretty coherent world whose inhabitants thoroughly fit into it. Admittedly, the larger thematic elements of the world and story aren't all that unique but they were immersive enough for me. I found it especially fitting that the game only drops little snippets as to what the Bygones, the mandatory precursor civilization, were up to. You never get a complete picture and it doesn't feel like you ought to. This world is supposed to be and remain mysterious.  \nCrime is another part of Drova. You can pick locks and steal other people's stuff as long as you're not caught. To avoid that, it's enough if other people just look the wrong way while you slowly walk behind their back. The day and night cycle can help netting you those opportunities. You can also attack almost everyone you meet. IF (big if!) you defeat them (and their friends if any are nearby), you can loot their bodies but they'll get back up after. Depending on the faction they belong to, they may or may not hold it against you after.\n\nOne thing to highlight is the attention to detail that the developers put into Drova. For example, the corpses of slain beasts remain throughout the game. But as you advance through the main story, they slowly decay, marking the passage of time. There's no mechanical need to have that extra pixel art for a decayed wolf carcass. But it's there nonetheless. Several side quests have multiple possible outcomes and their characters will often comment on those if you encounter them again, even during other quests. The game just feels like a labor of love.  \nAnother aspect is the initially mentioned player freedom. For one, the main quest has a major split at the end of the first chapter (of five), changing your allegiance and determining access to many future side quests. But you're also free to explore so much from the get-go - as long as you don't get yourself killed. Heck, if you explore enough in chapter 1, you can already unknowingly complete all of chapter 2 (thereby skipping the actual chapter) and/or already get the best weapons in the game.  \nOr you can get mugged and enslaved. Without reloading, that's far more likely, actually.\n\nIf you're up for a 2D Gothic without the jank, Drova is a great choice.  \nAlthough you might want to wait for ~2 more weeks since the devs have announced a major content patch which will change the chapter 3 main quests to be more reactive and add minor magic abilities for the early/mid game. There will also be some new end game content and further fixes. Or you could play it on the beta branch right now.",

            "body": "**Mario + Rabids: Kingdom Battle**\n\nI'm about finished with it and it's a real gem of a game. It feels like it has a lot of the edges of typical strategy games sanded down to provide a more simplified experience but the game has a lot of depth in it's own right. Surprisingly enough the rabbida actually do add a decent amount to the game, every Rabbid character model has a lot of charm to it and in pretty much every way this game feels like it has the classic Nintendo charm to it. Every battle is a blast and a lot of them feel mixed up in enough ways to where I never really feel like I'm going through the motions. The three different types of combat setups (kill all enemies, kill x number of enemies who keep spawning, and reach the end) are always paired with some unique environmental challenge or enemy setup so that it's a unique fight.\n\nMy only problem is the puzzles. Past the halfway point of the game they all just serve to make me stop playing the game and do something else. Every time I decide I'm done with the game it's because I ran into a puzzle and the only reason I think I'll hold off on the sequel for a bit is that I don't have the patience for similar puzzles. Also these puzzles could be solved by just bring able to jump or drop down a small ledge which is especially annoying in a Mario game.\n\nDefinitely enjoying it but I'm ready to finish it and I'll likely get the sequel once I think I can put up with more mediocre puzzles.",

            "body": "[Last time](https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1iaapox/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/m9cq1oa/)\n\n**Duck Detective: The Secret Salami** (PC) - a short 'cozy' detective game that I beat in a little under 2 hours. It's in the style of what I understand 'Return of the Obra Dinn' to be (though I've not played it) but with animated animal characters and a mystery that doesn't involve murder. I was also reminded of 'Tangle Tower' in terms of how the game has full voice acting. It's charming and a little bit of thought is required - it's not the most complicated game I've ever played but I think the difficulty is pitched just right. The noir pastiche is funny and I liked the element of choice at the end too. I'd recommend it on the whole and I'll probably play the sequel when it comes out.\n\n**Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare** (PS4) - Run on a PS5 and beaten on regular difficulty. I really enjoyed this - it felt like a breath of fresh air in the series after the disappointment of Ghosts.\n\nI was reminded of COD 4 at multiple points in terms of the potential horror of future technology and how much everyone in the story is acclimatised to it. There are some fairly sharp points made about private military corporations and the media itself, with some self-satire thrown in the mix (one scene re-capping the 'Traffic' mission segueing into a PR compilation felt especially daring). 'Captured' is quite an upsetting mission that hits fairly close to home. The plot has a great deal of propulsion and set pieces get the gravitas they deserve. There are some cliches thrown in there but I was kept entertained enough in the same manner as COD 4 acting as a fun pulpy experience. The only downside is that the main character doesn't talk outside of the cutscenes - an opportunity was missed to get his reaction to the unfolding events in the levels.\n\nThe gameplay has the biggest shake-up so far with new weapons, abilities and grenade types. The 'threat grenade' changed how I played the game - making me more cautious (especially with how strong some of the new enemies are). Traversal gets a good shake-up with double jumps meaning you can tactically take the high ground. There's drones, new vehicles, an armoured suit that actually makes sense unlike in Modern Warfare 3 and a grappling hook. One of the best levels in the game combines the grappling hook with stealth; it's ideas like this that means you get far more freedom than usual. The gameplay and story feels more integrated, with 'Captured' forcing you to take a new approach to combat. The sense of variety crosses into the locations too - there's ice caverns, futuristic cityscapes and classic landmarks.\n\nOverall, it's a fun campaign and Sledgehammer have brought what feels like a new perspective to Call of Duty; Advanced Warfare feels like a stand-alone shot in the arm for the franchise. I'm excited to see what they come up with next.\n\nUpdated ranking of the series (non-core games italicised):\n\n1. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare  \n2. Call of Duty: Black Ops II  \n3. Call of Duty: Black Ops  \n4. Call of Duty: World at War  \n5. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare  \n6. Call of Duty 2  \n7. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3  \n8.

            "body": "**Hitman World of Assassination**\n\nChongqing was up next and it's the best of the Hitman 3 maps thus far. Unlike the previous two maps it didn't really try anything new, but that left the great fundamental stuff shine so that's a win for me. Challenges were more fun a varied. Particularly liked escaping the facility after deleting the data on highest difficulty suit only. \n\nProbably doing Mendoza this weekend. \n\n**Ghost of Tsushima**\n\nAfter 60ish hours feels like I'm done. Finished the story, maxed out the legend and liberated all four regions. Great game, though slightly disappointing after all the hype. \n\nCombat was the best part of it for me. Played it on lethal and the high risk high reward style of it felt real nice compared to the bullet sponge style of high difficulty in other games. Still had to gimp myself a bit towards the end to keep fights vs normal enemies more interesting(though it did get harder in Iki at least). Also avoided most of the more 'supernatural' abilities. AI was a little dumb at times and insanely blind and deaf so stealth felt too overpowered even without stuff like the Ghost Armor, but I mostly opted for open combat anyway so it wasn't that big of a deal. Good variety of enemies, even if their movesets were pretty limited. Wish bosses had more varied attacks too. Thought the lack of lock on would be annoying, but other than attacking the air during some charged attacks it worked out well. I might be going crazy, but it felt like at times during story duels your attacks were limited when characters were talking. It made me really annoyed when I couldn't attack and immediately got one shotted. Felt like a really cheap death.\n\nMain story was OK, if pretty thin/tropey and had the usual problem I have with open world game stories, that it was losing focus with all the side content I was doing between story missions. Presented really well though, with nice cinematics, voice acting and great use of music. I liked the way Iki Island wrapped up the story more than base game ending. Performance capture could've been better. Side quests I enjoyed more and were mostly good even if they got a little repetitive after a while. Activities were a mixed bag. Stuff like the fox dens were dreadful, but the duels were great. The ones added on Iki island weren't anything amazing either, but helped it overall. I did like how it paced out the activities though, unlocking new ones as you explored new regions made it less boring even though way too many of them felt like a chore or just like collectibles which i don't care about. \n\nExploration was really nice. As someone who likes to play these kind of games with minimal UI I loved the guiding wind mechanic. Wish there was a way of setting it without opening your map, feels like that aspect kind of defeats the purpose. Very picturesque and cinematic at times, especially with the higher contrast option enabled. Mostly looked amazing(except for the beach areas) and ran great on my six years old midrange card so can't really complain about the performance. Didn't really like the golden birds leading you to stuff, felt easy to get tunnel visioned by it which seemed like the opposite of what the rest of the game was going for. Should've kept that only for the random cosmetics you find which don't show up on the map.\n\n\nTrying to get into **Legends Arceus** right now, but with my controller getting RMA'd after GoT killed my parry button I'll probably wait. Remains to be seen if it ends up being the first Pokemon game I finish. Will try some strategy/base building game in the mean time. Maybe **Tropico 6** or **Foundation**.",

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze_(typhoon) \n\nSo the game puts such a heavy emphasis on wind, especially in it's art direction. So masterful.

Plot is intriguing with heavy espionage theme, side quests are engaging and make you question the moral choices, characters have more depth and development, and the ending was just cinema. Give it a 10/10.\n\nCurrently in the 3rd act of the main game and several missions left to the ending. So far it's a wonderful game. Beautiful world, great voice acting, plot is interesting enough to keep me hooked. The gameplay is pretty fun. I do the Netrunner path so I'm more into stealth. Gunplay is fun enough. My criticism is the fact that the main quest is too short while the game is filled with side quests and gigs. in fact I was so deep into the side quests that sometimes I even forgot what the main one is all about. Also very few romance options in a world full of hot people! NPC are still pretty dumb sometimes. Honestly to me roaming around Night City is not as fun as Los Santos in GTA5. but overall the game is really great and I highly recommend the game, especially the DLC.",

It\u2019s amazing in every way, but I think the aspect the blew my mind the most was the art direction of the world, I fell like there\u2019s nothing like it, you just visit those areas that feel so sureal and it\u2019s incredible how the game keeps throwing new stuff at you even at the very end. Like I was blow away by the malenia mushroom castle stuff, this is an option endgame area and it was still as well design if not better than most of the games areas so far (that were also incredibly design), also the fight itself was insanely challenging, but so satisfying, felt like anime in the best way.\n\nI played a samurai the entire run, the boss that gave me the most trouble were Malenia and Mohg, Malenia was challenging but I was never mad because the fight was awesome. Mohg made my blood boil (pun intended) in rage, i thought he was insanely hard and only manage to beat him after decorating his entire move set.\n\nNow I\u2019m onto Baldur\u2019s gate 3, starting a new character and hopefully trying to finish it this time. Those are the games in the backlog I want to finish this year:\n\n- Horizon Zero Dawn\n- Nier Automata\n- Fire Emblem: Three Houses\n- Dragon Age: The Veilguard\n\nI also want to play Xenoblade Chronicles 3, i heard this game is very special so I\u2019ve been waiting for the right time to play it, I think this year I\u2019ll go for it.",

            "body": "**TCG Card Shop Simulator**\n\nSo usually I have no interest in these store shop sims, they always just kinda looked slapped together with generic Unity assets. And on the surface this one doesn't look any different, maybe it isn't any different since this is the only one I've played. \n\nIt's *addicting*. You start with a small store and some starting finances - buy a shelf and a couple booster packs, maybe some card sleeves, and turn a slow profit. In time, you get access to more. Expand the shop, get more shelves, put down some tables and charge an hourly rate for people to play there. Game mats, deck boxes, plushies, all that jazz. Hire some employees, begin to automate some of the tasks like stocking walls and manning the register. It's weirdly kind of nostalgic, since I used to work at a GameStop for some years, so the feeling of selling nerd shit to stinky people hits home. \n\nI think what gives this game an extra oomph is that you can open booster packs yourself, get rare cards or bundle together cheap ones, and throw them out there and set a price and see what you can get. \n\nAlso a friend hooked me up with the Pokemon mod, which I guess is harder to find now because of Nintendo takedowns. Bummer, cause it's fucking awesome and really well done. It makes me realize how many opportunities Nintendo is missing out on as far as collaborations go, just to 'protect their brand' or whatever. If Nintendo partnered with the dev and modder and sold this DLC for $10? I would have bought it. And that's almost as much as the game is when not on sale.",

I can't remember why I bounced off the first one, but I loved this. Apparently this dev is remaking the 1st game in this one's engine, so I guess I'm not the only one who felt this way.\n\nIf you like sneaking around office buildings, warehouses and homes, disabling lights and cameras, and hitting patrolling guards in the back of the head, this is for you. The writing is very corny and edgy at the best of the times but you don't need to pay any attention to it.\n\nNote that by default you have limited saves, but you have very fine control over the difficulty so you can disable this if you prefer.\n\n**Rogue Waters**\n\nAn Xcom-ish roguelite turn-based tactics pirate game that doesn't quite get beyond \"okay\" for me. Perfectly fine gameplay but it becomes very repetitive, the roguelite \"runs\" differ so little that I don't think they added anything to the game.\n\nUnfortunately I probably grinded too hard and leveled my crew quite high before doing much story content and ended up finding the combat extremely easy as a result. It's a shame because I like what's there, but it just felt so easy and so repetitive, extremely lacking in progression.\n\n**Knights in Tight Spaces** (KITS)\n\nInto the Breach-style turn based gameplay via cards, a soft sequel to Fights in Tight Spaces (FITS). I should be this game's biggest advocate, I have 95 hours in FITS and 100%'d it, I loved it. But to me this feels like way, way too much of the same. It's still a good game, but it's hard to call it a direct *upgrade* in any one way - more of a side-grade if anything. \n\nWorst, I don't think it addressed FITS' most glaring flaw, which was that its difficulty scales up very high and you NEED to rely on a small subset of its huge library of cards just to survive. Runs go on for literal hours, and it's crushing to lose because essentials, such as a good movement card or good scaling card, were just never offered to you. By the end game, enemies will have 10 different ways to hit you and can chase you around the grid, you just can't afford to have anything but the S+ tier cards to draw once you're there.\n\nThe game is fine, but I'm disappointed that for all the surface-level changes, and even controlling multiple characters instead of one (something I'm not a fan of anyway), it feels too samey and like no lessons were learned from the previous game. If you like Into the Breach, pick up Fights in Tight Spaces. If you like FITS... I dunno, maybe wait for a 50% deal on this.",

            "body": "**The Invincible**  was awesome. It's a very engrossing experience - I truly felt so alone on Regis III and I really like that the tone was consistently straight and serious throughout aside from some realistic attempts by characters to lighten the mood through dialogue. The visuals of the planet are fantastic and I also really enjoyed the depiction of high tech analogue equipment and 50-60s era sci-fi ideas. My only real complaints are that I wish I didn't play the demo last year because it gave away some spoilers and how the/my ending played out. I'm perfectly happy with what the ending was - but the dialogue kind of took on a life of its own there. >!Essentially I had a long conversation between Yasna, Novik and Rohytra where I was able to successfully convince Rohytra to not nuke the planet into pieces. But the argument for doing so revolves around necroevolution and machine life and the history of life on Regis III which are all hinted at throughout the game but suddenly Yasna is giving a thesis on how all these things worked/happened as though it's a foregone conclusion. It was just strange how it was speculation and hypotheses on a mystery throughout the game and then it wasn't.!< Regardless that was certainly a bit confusing but I still had a great time.\n\n\nA friend and I played **Split Fiction** and it is very very good. It's filled to the brim with creative and entertaining settings and ideas. I particularly enjoyed Zoe's >!Kite World and Moon Market!< and Mio's >!THPS inspired snowboarding!<. Story and dialogue get off to a rough start though as Zoe and Mio spend the first ~third of the game defined largely by stereotypes and cliches to highlight how different they are - country girl and city girl, real music and techno music, family friendly and explosive action, extrovert and introvert, blonde and brunette, etc. They don't feel like diverse strangers but rather formulated opposites. Poor Mio gets the worst of it as she is genuinely unlikable for a while. It doesn't help that a lot of the filler dialogue sounds like what 40 year olds think 20 year olds sound like as multiple times things are described as 'straight up ballin' and various types of 'epic!' Eventually they better understand each other and a friendship starts to form and they communicate like people instead of caricatures. Further reveals about each of their backstories lead to some genuine emotional moments and I'm now quite fond of each one and their bond - but it's a rocky start.\n\nGameplay throughout is solid. While it is predominantly a platformer-puzzler there are lots of interesting twists on the idea as well as some surprising departures into other game genres. It's also full of homages and influences - along the way I was reminded of >!Control, Contra, Tony Hawks Pro Skater, Half Life and God of War!< to name a few. However I do think that the adherence to sci-fi and fantasy limits the game environments a bit and in retrospect they can kind of run together whereas It Takes Two I can clearly remember the garage, the tree, the toyroom, the attic, the snowglobe, etc. I think It Takes Two had more range and I kind of missed that. Another element of It Takes Two that I missed was the variety of minigames, widgets and easter eggs. I think Split Fiction is substantially more linear in that regard - there were a handful [that we found] but we were disappointed that there was no equivalent of the snow village or helltower.\nAll in all it was a fantastic 15 hour game with both style and substance though, no regrets purchasing it straight away and we're definitely looking forward to whatever Hazelight does next.",

Fortunately, the balance of these disadvantages comes from the levels being short and not overstaying their welcome.

There doesn\u2019t seem to be nothing to improve here \u2013 it\u2019s fully a well-made game based on 90\u2019s police movies. The main character is an american happy-go-lucky brawler in the likeness of Mel Gibson roles from \u201eLethal Weapon\u201d or \u201eMaverick\u201d. The city is huge and looks good. The police jobs make the city feel quite lively because literally every minute you get a quest and something is actually happening on the streets and if you\u2019re lucky you can even encounter a crime before getting a mission I believe. And missions are varied. They\u2019re well made but I felt like the arrest mechanics doesn\u2019t work properly. Game has lot to offer: driving, shooting, fighting and you can develop in every field. There is maybe the best destructible environment out of any older game \u2013 the bullet time mechanism makes it even more impressive. It seems like everything can be destroyed gradually. Fighting is ok, it reminds me of Shenmue, you need to think what you\u2019re doing and there are many moves to learn but I\u2019m not a fan of combos when the opponent is stunned. Driving is a little clunky, worse than GTA 3 but better than The Getaway. There is a good collection of cars but am I stupid or does racing in this game have no routes or signs? You only need to get to the point first and doesn\u2019t matter what route you pick? The stealth missions are forced and silly. The story is your typical 90\u2019s police action movie and it\u2019s fine but >!ancient ghosts and dragons here!<? Lol\n\n**Max Payne 2 \u2013** third game in a row about famous 2-pistoled guys (a week ago I posted about DMC2). I enjoyed the most the details that each location, room or a scene was filled with if you were patient or obserwant enough to notice \u2013 the little conversations, the shows on tv etc. Of course it\u2019s still a fun game but the constant shooting in tight places gets tedious like in the first game. And just like MP1 it has distinct sense of style. It\u2019s dark, satirical and overly dramatic. There is a care put to every word and I think I appreciate MP more for its literary than gaming artistry but I feel like this time there was way less at stakes. Even the profundity of the original game feels tainted because Max finds >!another woman he cares !<about but this time it\u2019s more about lust and fascination than love and family warmth. Still, it\u2019s nuanced and deeply psychological and maybe it\u2019s a natural reaction but the previous story was much more intimate (it\u2019s weird to say because you just can\u2019t have more intimate, personal writing than MP1 or MP2 no matter how over the top they are) but maybe I just didn\u2019t understand it correctly.\n\nThe Funhouse was artistically a pleasant level with a great potential to tease player.\n\n**Fatal Frame(XBOX)\u00a0\u2013** for a game that has such a grotesque imagery, setting and encounters this was surprisingly not scary. When I got the camera I doubted that it can provide a satisfying gameplay, rpg systems that won\u2019t feel forced and out of place but they turned out to be probably the best part of the game. You gain exp fighting agressive ghosts and shooting photos of the passive ones (it requires reflex because they show up and disappear quickly) or finding hidden ghosts. You can spend exp improving your camera\u2019s characteristics or gain special skills. And I know this sound very basic but it works well which I didn\u2019t expect. And the ghost fights are nuanced and challenging. It feels like a shooter but with a depth because it\u2019s not enough to just shoot but also find a perfect time to do it, to deal the most damage while not losing the ghost from your sight. The protagonist movement is too slow. Climbing the ladder, opening the doors and \u201erunning\u201d is way too slow. And you can be attacked by ghostswhile doing it and then you are defenseless. It\u2019s frustrating. The voice acting is horrible as always. The setting is an old japanese mansion \u2013 very cool. The story I believe is simple but the way it\u2019s delivered makes it hard to focus on and comprehend. I will need to watch some recap of the story. I\u2019m looking forward to the next games.",

It also is surprisingly much less squad-based than I had thought from my previous experience with WWII-themed FPS-games; you more than often tread alone instead of among other NPCs in battle, which are mostly bearable in the earlier levels with rather tight corridors that it reminds me a bit of playing the *Wolfenstein*-games.\n\nBut later levels where the areas and zones opens up grants additional challenges; enemy-soldiers can often with pin-point accuracy and reaction to the point that the game can become very frustating, and where save-scumming is encouraged just to spot where the enemy nazi-soldiers are coming from. Levels such as [*Sniper's Last Stand*](https://youtu.be/x1-Ka0rEK5U) is a very good case of it.\n\nStill, it is nontheless a fascinating piece of video game history classic, as I understand it is a game that many people view as the core-experience of *Medal of Honor*-series, [with the storming of the Normandy-invasion as the game's center-piece](https://youtu.be/XHscQgzkMKg), to which it is an excellent scripted segment with highly intense sound design and military chattery just selling the intense odds the invasion forces faced.",

Premise tiptoes that line between dark humor and gruesome real-world tragedy. Esposito does an amazing job playing a ruthless pragmatic villain. Really appreciate how much personality they gave your protagonist this time around as well.",

For the current price on sale I would definitely recommend.\n\n**Vandal Hearts**\n\nStarted this up for the first time. 4 hours in. As someone who didn't warm up to the SRPG genre quite yet, Vandal Hearts is slowly doing the job. There is a story reason for every fight (not common for its time), characters are being developed and a story is progressed at a good pace and the battles are difficult, but doable so far. I also enjoy that there is no perma-death in this one. Obviously all of these things come with caveats due to the game's age. It depends on your perspective. The writing is awful from a modern perspective, but quite admirable for its time. The visuals are poor these days, but the special effects are plentiful and well made for its time. And so on. I am still motivated to keep playing and for retro SRPG fans I can already definitely recommend this one.",

I finished it yesterday after 120 hours and was a bit emotional to end this journey. Henry is a gem of a protagonist (courageous, heroic, gentle, but still flawed), all supporting characters are great and well-developed (especially Hans, my man), the story has excellent stakes without being too high, the world is a joy to explore and the majority of the sidequests and tasks are well-developed and super fun to play.\n\nAs a new player, the gameplay was a little rough to learn properly, but it goes well with how we start the game: we learn with Henry.\n\nThe RPG elements are super well-developed, and I can't wait to replay it as a different persona as my stealthy/charismatic blacksmith.\n\nI also would like to note how much I liked the ending. Spoiler: >!I didn't expect that the last 4-5 hours of the game would be managing a siege. It was a change of pace that I enjoyed immensely, and I found it to be an original way of ending the game. Everything about it was great.!<\n\nMy only complaints would be the bugs I encountered (especially the unavailable side quests all over my map?) and I wasn't a big fan of the fighting: found it rough around the edges until the end. It's possible though that I just didn't put enough effort into growing my fighting skills + learning the combos, but oh well.\n\nOtherwise, it was an absolute joy and I recommend it, even if you didn't play the first one! I will be waiting for the upcoming DLCs and the third one eagerly.",

The art and music are very nice, but there's almost nothing here mechanically and the writing is just a little.. unremarkable? It's not bad, but it's not \"good\" either. It's all very serviceable. I keep playing it in hopes that the next bit is going to impress me. The concept and fundamentals feel good. It's just fine. It's a fine 7/10 game that some people are going to really like.\n\nI grabbed **Wanderstop** and the bit I've played is great.\n\nIt does what I really want cozy games to do, which is to have something interesting layered on the cozy. The OG \"cozy\" games weren't really that cozy. I remember Harvest Moon on N64 being played pretty straight as far as comfort goes. It was about running a farm, but not an overly comfortable one. It felt like work, but it lead to the satisfaction of a fully functioning farm. Most farm/shop/etc sims in recent years have leaned way into the creative sandbox part and away from the game part to the point where they're just not that interesting. Everyone and everything is entirely too pleasant for my taste.\n\nWanderstop is a game like that, but it's about something. It's not hard. There's no progression. But the creative sandbox serves a narrative purpose. Everyone and everything is still pleasant, but it's purposefully pleasant. There's a stress that the pleasantness is contrasted with in the main character, and that creates interesting friction. \n\nI'm glad it's not a \"dark\" or \"edgy\" type of friction. There's no sinister twist here. It wears what it is on it's sleeve. And then it immediately jumps from there into some fun and interesting writing. It's great. The art is nice and the music is *excellent*. But the star is the writing, which is hilarious. I should have expected it from the writer of The Stanley Parable, but every single thing in this game that has been \"comedic\" in this game has hit a bullseye for me. Multiple moments where I'm laughing out loud so far. \n\nI get the feeling I'm really going to like this one.",

            "body": "I finally got my **TrimUI** Brick shipped, and it\u00b4s everything I wanted and a little more ( cause the screen makes pixel art look way better than I expected ). Well, close to everything - A lot of the Linux ports run pretty badly, but **Sonic Mania**, **UFO 50**, **Cave Story** and **The Void Rains Upon Her Heart** work pretty well for what I want ( UFO 50 only runs half the games at full speed though ).  \n\n**Gunstar Heroes** is the first game I finished on the console. It\u00b4s a really neat game. I played Gunstar Super Heroes as a child, and I was surprised how much from that is also in this older title - I guess the GBA one is a remake. It is really surprising just how much the game wants you to beat it - patterns are super varied, but damage is low and once you know how to dodge them most gimmicks are super fair ( except for the Final Boss - most attacks seemed really unforgiving there ). The gun combination mechanic is cool, but it feels pretty lopsided - Fire is always pretty insane in any combo, and besides that I only really found use for Pointer + Lightning.  \n\nI think I have another playthrough for that in me! Playing the other control style, trying to die a lot less and experimenting a little with the mechanics ( I found out you can throw bombs back if you time it really well in the last level, I hope there are more hidden little tricks like that. ) A great time, and I am looking forward to play all the other Treasure Action games now.  \n\nOn PC, I played through the beginnings of a lot of indie games, refunding most of them - I do this a lot on sales to check out my wishlist titles. One game that stuck is **Valley Peaks.**\n\n**Valley Peaks** is a super casual climbing game - great artstyle, great colors, quirky dialogue that works rather than quirky dialogue that doesn\u00b4t. The climbing is simple. but varied and quick enough that it doesn\u00b4t get old. I think its a great entry to the genre, and I am stoked to play more ( looking forward to Cairn and White Knuckle especially ). Something that stuck out about the game is the nice collectathon progression and the cool little things you can find in the open world, away from the titular Peaks themselves. Once I am done with this game, I will come back to Peaks of Yore ( another, a little more complex climbing game), which I inexplicably dropped despite loving the couple of hours I played of it.",

The gameplay is improved, though the game is still too easy (except for a second-to-last boss encounter in the last dungeon, which was just an insane way to design a boss fight). I ended up really enjoying the story overall, even though it doesn't progress the narrative of Trails series or explore Calvard in greater detail. M\u00e4rchen Garten is weird, it's Reverie Corridor except shit. I don't know why they keep shoving lootboxes in these games but they're always obnoxious. The series excels at character moments and relationships and DBII is no exception. >!I really dislike Kasim so far, he's treated as some legendary super strong warrior but he mostly does fuck all, they should really put some effort in showing him actually be powerful instead of just jerking him off all the time. Cao is a shit tier character and has been since his introduction. I really hope he just stops appearing in these games or gets killed off!<.\n\nOverall, lots of fun, not as good as Daybreak 1 but still pretty good, 8/10 and easy recommendation for fans of the series.",

            "body": "**NORCO**\n\nFinished this up this week. For anyone who has any kind of appetite for story/vibe heavy games with just enough gameplay to avoid being a walking simulator, this is mandatory. I don't want to spoil the story but it starts very contemplative and moody and slowly but steadily builds to absolute batshit of the best kind.\n\nThe hopeful but beaten punk vibes spoke to me personally. I appreciate that the game has strong female characters that avoid any tropes you normally find in a video game. Basically, I have to stress that this game has actually good writing, not just comic booky, good for a video game, writing.\n\nPeople compared it to Disco Elysium when it came out. They both have some attitude, but the magical realism Americana reminds me much more of Kentucky Route Zero. KTR with more swears.\n\n>!Deus vult, motherfucker!!<\n\n**Bravely Default**\n\nI have an endless cycle where I love the idea of cozying up with a FF/DQ-esque JRPG, but drawn out stories and undercooked combat always end up clashing with my ADHD and I put the game down 20-30 hours in, without finishing it, only to try again with another game like a year later.\n\nWell, I'm 10 hours in with BD right now. Music is amazing. Art direction is great. I appreciate how much the art is kind of min/maxed from a technical stand point. I'm playing on my Retroid Pocket 2S. Any youtuber would probably tell you not to even bother trying to get 3DS running on that thing, but this game is clicking along with near zero issues for me.\n\nCombat has a bit more substance to it with the jobs and turn system, but still doesn't feel quite as interesting to me as peak SMT or FFT, my high points for JRPG combat. A lot of bosses so far only have 2-3 real moves, and way too much health, leaving me having fully figured out the boss and then still sitting there whacking at it for another 10 minutes.\n\nThe game does some little stuff to put it on the harder side of JRPGs. HP and MP don't refill on level up. You have to walk all the way back out of dungeons after boss fights. Status status ailments are impactful and stick around between fights. This is all cool in theory, but the game also lets you tune the random encounter rate, turning it up, or setting it to zero. All the touches designed to make dungeon crawling harder become weird and annoying when you can turn off encounters at any point and walk back to town to sleep, with the only cost being mild annoyance at time lost. These to ideas don't work together at all, in my mind.\n\nThe story is meh and basic so far in chapter 1, but I understand more interesting stuff is coming down the line. Hopefully it doesn't take too long to get there. Everyone is a little too chatty and trope-y for my taste right now. \n\nHaving this on a little hand-held that I can sleep and pick up whenever is keeping me playing another 30 minutes at a time. We'll see how long it sticks.\n\n**Red Dead Redemption 2**\n\nWorking on chapter 1 now. First time playing this. Liking the vibes so far. Everyone told me about the slow, cinematic gameplay. I popped an edible and I was ready. What no one told me about was the wild fucking amount of video game-y gameplay they try to cram in here. I don't want to deal with 30 different involved mechanics. Just let me ride my fucking horse, and then pet my fucking horse. JFC. I'm trying to ride my wagon to a new camp and listen to my friend muse on the plight of native americans and there is literally an endless stream of tutorials popping up in the corner interrupting me. I'm not reading that. Fuck off.\n\nThe developers seemed to not actually be ready for all the gameplay either, because this is legitimately the worst controlling game I've every played where the control issues all seem to be deliberate choices. I can not tell you the intent behind a single button. I can not guess what button should be hit at any given time. I'm stuck with my eyes permanently glued to the bottom right of the screen (opposite of the top-left where they spam tutorial messages), waiting for the game to tell me. This kills so much of the mood.\n\nThere's a moment in a barn where I walked over, was told to his square to pick up my hat, then take two steps, then hit R1 to pick up my gun. I can not express how stupid this is.\n\nI still can't tell you exactly how shooting works. I think there's some kind of soft lock on system but fuck if I know how it actually works. I've been playing games since 3D was invented. If I'm confused by your third person shooting you done fucked up.\n\nAnd to top it all off, I can't call my horse \"ACAB\" because that might upset someone in my single player game.\n\nAnyway, story seems cool. I'll probably stick with it.",
