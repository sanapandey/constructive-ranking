Its not a live service MMO, but its entirely in line with what EA was saying in 2010. Multiplayer is a major value add to most gamers",

It's arguably easier because you skip the commute to said hobby.\n\nI work 50-60 hours a week, my buddies all have full-time jobs.

The actual content of the characters isn't particularly deep, but the prose of the script is adequately competent and the addition of motion capture made their performances quite immersive. I'd say BG3's mo-cap is as close as one can get to Naughty Dog's mocap quality without having their gigantic in-house studio.",

Two out of these three aren't even just evil but blatantly, gloatingly evil, to the point that if you're playing even a remotely heroic character there's zero reason why you would want them in the party. Yes, yes, I get it, they can have redemption arcs, but that's metagaming, plus just because I'm playing someone heroic doesn't mean I want to play the group therapist.\n\nI think it's perfectly fine for a game to have evil companions, obviously, specially since the game doesn't force you to recruit them. But half of them is too much. What I think is specially telling is that in Early Access, both Wyll and Gale were more morally questionable and Karlach wasn't available, meaning all characters were just shades of grey to black. This, to me, shows Larian is stuck with the misconception that edgy and complicated makes for an interesting character.",

And what happened? Almost all of them failed. They weren't pulling people off of WoW because those players already had a lot of time and money sunk in to that, they already had friends there. And on top of that MMOs were expensive to develop and support long enough to be valuable. The 2nd place MMO at the time was a *distant* 2nd place (I don't remember which, but probably Everquest or FFXI or something).\n\n2009 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 drops and any company that could pull together a million dollar budget was releasing some basic ass multiplayer shooter thinking they were going to make CoD money. Games that didn't need it were having development hours and dollars siphoned away and the end result is that games would ship half made usually with a multiplayer mode that felt super out of place. Sometimes the multiplayer was made by a completely different company just using the assets so it usually *was* out of place.\n\nVery rarely do any of these trend chasers actually achieve something beyond the trend their copying, but there are a few exceptions, most notably Fortnite. PUBG had such a massive success that a deluge of massive battleground (and later, extraction) shooters dumped into the market, and while this trend is going on still only a few of them have had any staying power. Fortnite is the obvious one, and mostly because they innovated in gameplay *and* made it free. The other ones that have lasted toned down the player counts from 100 to maybe a dozen and tend to be more extraction types.\n\nBut what always happens is that there's a finite amount of money and attention people are willing to give to these trends, so unless something is *the best version* of whatever niche they're in, most players are going to skip it. And if companies stopped trying to just copy what is working for someone else and actually tried to niche-partition the market by either innovating enough that players had a legitimate reason to pick one over another, then they might have moderate success. But moderate success isn't enough for these companies, they need to move 10 figures just to satisfy their business interest and that's just never going to be sustainable.",

An MMO today would have to release with the equivalent end game content and polish of an MMO that has been getting content updates for years already. Gone are the days of players sticking with an MMO during it's infancy and growing pains era. \n\n3 - I don't know if I even have it in me anymore to play an MMO to that degree even though I tell myself I want to. I was like 22 years old when Wrath came out. I was working full time but was single and lived alone. I just went to work in the morning and gamed all night. Was no big deal to raid in WoW till 1-2am then get up and go to work at 6am. I'd probably die if I tried that now lol.",

A lot of western companies are finding the cost of games are ballooning precisely because of where they work and the salary increases they\u2019ve gotten to match of CoL in those areas. A game that would take 70mil to develop in Europe could be 150mil to develop here. AAA games typically have around 125 devs working on them. 125 x  lets say an average of 80k between all their workers/positions x 4-5 year game dev cycle and that\u2019s alrdy 40-50mil developing something not guaranteed to sell. I\u2019m also lowballing the employee count and salary cost as well and this could easily be a lot higher. Then you take in 30% storefront cut, engine fees, marketing costs, further development on bug fixes/additional content and it becomes expensive to make a game now.",

Over the long term, they're not cheaper... but they probably are generally cheaper to release because you're not expected to have anywhere near the same amount of content out of the starting gate as a full-fledged single player game.  People will take the \"unfinished\" nature of it if you're going to hit them with regular updates relatively soon after launch, provided there's enough replayability there to keep people interested.\n\nIf you've released a failure... you're going to know before you invest any more significant amount of money in it.  If you frontload all that cost on the assumption that you will be a hit and it will pay off in the end, or you take way, WAY too long to develop the game and release it... then yeah, that can turn out quite badly.  I hate to say it because it affects the quality of the game, but the play is to spend just enough to find out whether people will actually bite and play your shit so that you can commit when you have a success on your hands or you can pull back when you realize it's just not going to bear fruit.\n\nThat's partly why I don't like live service as a concept and don't buy into them generally.  With single player, the relationship between dev and consumer is \"Here's everything that you get for $70\", and they have to convince me with what they have for me to spend the money on the product.  With a live service, the relationship is a bunch of promises that may or may never materialize.  For a free to play game, that's... okay.  If you're selling me a $70 live service game, I have no idea what the fuck I'm even buying because I'm being sold a bunch of promises alongside what's already in the game.  If what's already in the game isn't enough to justify the price tag... then you and I have a problem because the money you want me to spend on the game is entirely dependent on whether or not other people will buy and play this thing long term, and that's just not good enough for me.",

No trend chasing, no dumbing down the brand for mass appeal and compromising who they are, devs keep doing that and releasing their 6-7 out of 10 ubisoft games they will keep getting the same results.",

Honestly, the director from Larian seems to share a lot of the simplistic beliefs you see Gamers parroting online, like now he's on the \"just make good games\" shit, but even when people were doing the  \"BG3 is a new standard!\" thing, he had an interview where he basically said \"I don't believe in standards because even if BG3 is the new standard, something new will come out soon after and set another new standard\" which has not happened and likely will not happen for a very long time.

                            "body": "A few examples that comes up to mind:\n\n* *Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess* was decently highly reviewed of around 80-84 Metacritic score, [yet Capcom stated that the game failed to meet its sales expectations](https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcoms-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-missed-sales-targets-despite-high-reviews/).\n\n* *Dishonored 2*, despite being a sequel to a well-loved game and with notable features such as the levels of the Clockwork Mansion, or the time-shift level that gave the game good words at mouth, [sold 40% less than the sequel](https://www.techspot.com/news/76047-bethesda-arkane-studios-put-dishonored-franchise-hiatus.html), and put the franchise on a big hiatus. The game was even [more expensive than *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/dishonored-2-cost-more-to-make-than-skyrim-and-sold-worse-but-ex-dev-says-it-was-so-good-that-it-gave-arkane-seal-of-quality-protection-within-bethesda/), but at the very least gave Arkane a sense of \"seal of approval\" in terms of quality production for the internal development teams.\n\n* *Midnight Suns*, a Tactics-game with many of the creative leads behind the *X-Com*-franchise behind it, was while not a complete sales flop and sold decently, it did not sell well enough to the point that the game dropped support less than a year. Granted, there are multiple reasonings behind it, such as the niche card-system mechanics, or the game being released in the middle of a very busy release where it had to compete titles such as *God of War: Ragnar\u00f6k*, *Sonic: Frontiers* or *Pokemon: Scarlet & Violet*.\n\n* *Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown* [sold only 300,000 sales on the 1st month](https://www.dualshockers.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sales-struggle-not-surprising/) despite great reviews by critics as well as words-of-mouth. Again, this could also be explained due to the game not having a Steam-release, as well as being released during a busy launch-period, where games like *Tekken 8*, *Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth*, and *Palworld* had higher notoriety at the time.\n\n* *Alien: Isolation* has a stellar reputation among horror-fans, [but where Sega lamented its sales to the point that the IP was only extended to a mobile-game sequel](https://web.archive.org/web/20170125152341/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-05-11-sega-laments-weak-game-sales-even-as-hard-numbers-rise), and which is understandable why the franchise wouldn't get revisited with a sequel until a decade. A lot of AAA horror-games actually has notable difficulty with selling, such as [*Alan Wake 2* taking over a year for Remedy to declare the game \"almost profitable\" in recouping its development costs](https://www.thegamer.com/alan-wake-2-has-finally-recouped-most-of-its-budget-remedy-financial-results/), or even games like [the original *Dead Space*-trilogy](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/new-report-reveals-dead-space-2s-high-budget-and-low-sales/).\n\nIt's a very complicated matter to why certain games may just not sell well, from lack of marketing, to too much marketing costs, to too busy release period, or just having words-of-mouth not selling at all, and what other priorities publishers and developers has to greenlight continued projects. As an example, CyberConnect2, a studio that is most notable for their anime-themed fighting games, are willing to put up a full trilogy for their *Fuga: Melodies of Steel*, despite the games being well-known for not selling well at all to be profitable for them, simply because it is their passion pet project to make.",

When you're throwing around several hundred million dollars you can't just whack it in an index fund, investors invest in specific companies and projects like this because they have to do something with the money and diversification is critical.\n\nIt should also be noted that \"just invested into like stock markets\" *is* funding projects.

                                            "body": "It's also a weirdly phrased quote to begin with:\n\n\"[Consumers] got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection,\" said Tremblay. \"That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. As gamers grow comfortable in that aspect \u2026 you don't lose your progress. If you resume your game at another time, your progress file is still there. That's not been deleted. You don't lose what you've built in the game or your engagement with the game. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game.\"\n\nI sincerely don't know what he means by not losing progress. Does he know you can save games onto your system's drive with a disk? \nDoes he think people who play games don't know how cloud save files work and is trying to reassure them? Does he know game disks are pretty easy to carry around when you travel?\n\n\"I still have two boxes of DVDs. I definitely understand the gamers perspective with that. But as people embrace that model, they will see that these games will exist, the service will continue, and you'll be able to access them when you feel like. That's reassuring.\n\nThis is the more egregious quote IMO. There are digital download games that are straight-up gone and can't be legally obtained physically or digitally anymore. A license expires? Poof. Not all services \"will continue.\" He says \"That's reassuring\" like it's a fact. Assuredness is a subjective emotion. He is a director at Ubisoft, he has no real reason to worry. People like this use that strategy a lot. \n\n\"That's reassuring. That's a good thing. This is beneficial for customers.\" Who are you to decide that? But you aren't deciding it, are you? You're using a a direct, confident, \"objective,\" statement to craft a persuasive argument to convince people to \"be assured.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, it's still about facilitating the transition to subscription based, continuous income for companies rather than immediate one-and-done purchases - just in lighter terms. Because guess what happens if/when physical media goes extinct?\n\nSubscription prices will go up even further because *then* you won't have a choice. It's why disc-less drives are cheaper for customers - they can't get games secondhand. Same way Walmart destroyed local small town economies by coming in, lowering prices way further than hometown grocery stores, causing them to go out of business, and then raising prices back up after their competition left.\n\nGames piracy has been at a low for a while thanks to subscription and cloud-based gaming prices being *fairly* reasonable so far. That XBox Game Pass starts hitting $30, $40, $50 a month? You'll see politicians cracking down on piracy again. \"They won't get that expensive?\" Yeah? How do you know? When has anything other than gas gone up and price and later permanently been lowered? Sure, deals and sales and such. And we all know businesses are satisfied with the money they're making right now, right?\n\nThere is a difference between \"gamers should get comfortable with it\" versus \"gamers will get comfortable with it.\" Absolutely. But that phrasing gives plausible deniability to their intent. \"No we don't want to force gamers to get on board\" \n\n\"We just want to streamline the process of gaming by improving accessibility to their games from anywhere without needing a physical disk\"\n\nThey're not going to outright say, \"we want gamers to keep giving us money over a long period rather than pay us once\" lol. I would respect the honesty.\n\n\"It's about feeling more comfortable with not owning your game.\"\nHe uses his words carefully. What is \"It?\" You mentioned \"viability.\" but the articles say \"expand.\" There is a difference there. Subscription services are already viable. They function. They make money. They have proven that they work as intended.\n\nThey want to *expand*. Expand how? More money, obviously. They're definitely not talking about making inroads in putting factories in African countries. or something. \n\n\"I don't have a crystal ball, but when you look at the different subscription services that are out there, we've had a rapid expansion over the last couple of years, but it's still relatively small compared to the other models,\" Tremblay said. \n\nUnderstanding what the person actually said is important, but even more important than that is comprehending what the person actually *means*. \n\nThere is an upper limit on the expansion of physical sales and it depends on who can afford to buy $70-$100 games. But a $15**+** subscription for everybody that wants to play? Plus conveniences, premium plans, lootboxes, microtransactions? Baby, we're cooking with gas now. $15 \"isn't bad\" for customers ***for right now***. \n\n\"Sorry, we have to increase monthly service by $2 this year even though your wages are stagnating and shit's on fire\"\n\nThey are thinking short-long term. Eventually, people will stop playing games because they can't afford it anymore - which is where microtransaction whales step in. You strike that addiction nerve in some people the right way and they can maybe offset losses for a while. For a while. \n\nOf course, addicts might spend food money on gacha games - but that is their *choice*. Right?\n\nBut again, there's an upper-limit to expansion and profits. It's why Oreo comes out with wacky flavors 8 times a year to get a .0005% boost to revenues. Once you've hit saturation, the only way to go is sideways - or down, or innovate - but VR has been stuck for a while.\n\nLeeches, parasites, mosquitoes, vampires - all have become cliche terms referring to businesses like this. But they are literally designing plans to continually drain customers rather than customers giving them a blood donation once in a while. \n\nThe people who were outraged at this quote understood this, even if they weren't exactly articulate about it. And logically, when you read what he said, he said something different than what people think he said. But he meant what he meant and people know what he meant because it's a familiar story that has been going on for a while.\n\nBut besides all that, why does he deserve the benefit of the doubt? Or charity in interpreting his words? Why trust him? For every equation,there are two sides. For every winner, there is at least one loser. He has one job and it is to win his business and its shareholders more money. Not benefit customers.",

The creation kit is less than a year old and there are significant engine changes from previous games that means modders need to learn stuff from scratch. The Starfield Script Extender only came out in November, again limiting reach.What we're seeing is mostly due to lack of tools, not lack of enthusiasm\n\n\n\n\nThere's definitely way less excitement about it than Skyrim though, but Skyrim is truly a beast that is only comparable to Minecraft when it comes to modern modding.\u00a0 We're more comparable to the state Fallout 4 was 1.5 years after release",

It's why that Act 3, in many ways, feels very disjointed, such as why there is a noble mansion in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate that is somehow connected to the city ramparts, and where >!Astarion's master lived!<.\n\nAs an example of how incomplete the game was, the game didn't even had any epilogue-slides or sequences, which gave the game's ending such a big anti-climax that Larian had to patch in the epilogue post-release. It genuinely was probably one of the worst ending I experienced since *Mass Effect 3*'s original endings of just how vapid the game's conclusion was. It has mitigated it somewhat after many post-launch updates, but there is still a notable element of how \"empty\" Act 3 feels, such as how you would expect moments to occur that just don't. Like how the city of BG3 has a dying tree, but you can't do any druidic action towards it, or how there aren't any last speech farewells before going to the big battle like games like *Pathfinder: Wrath of the Rightous* or [*Dragon Age: Origins*](https://youtu.be/bCbN-C2sdQA); standard cRPG-moments.\n\nHeck, at one point, my character straight up >!gets killed as part of being Bhaalspawn!<, right in front of the party, but no one has any reactions towards it. It's frustrating, since the previous Act I held up a good standard of quality in terms of reactivity (Granted, even Act I was faulty, such as how the game refuses for instance to recognize knocked out NPCs like the Hag Victim's brothers, that the game instead claims that you've killed.), but which Act 3 does not hold up.",

Plenty of good games sell poorly--it's not enough to \"just make good games.\" The same goes for people who say that indie games are thriving just because games like Balatro break through every once in a while. *Hundreds* of incredibly good indie games get released and completely ignored every year because it's nearly impossible to stand out from the crowd unless a major streamer decides to showcase your game or something. It's an even worse space to be in, commercially-speaking.\n\nAnyone saying single-player games are \"dead\" is wrong, but so are people saying that \"just make good games and they'll sell.\"",

Not every company has the luxury of a war chest big enough to gamble their studio's existence on one mega-game.\n2. Not every company \\*would\\* do that even if they had the money up front.\n3.

Sometimes it's bad marketing, sometimes the game is only \"pretty good\" and not \"great\", and sometimes it's just \\*bad luck\\*. Sometimes, a studio makes a great game that nevertheless cannot find an audience. Maybe they released at a bad time, maybe they're following a competitor in the genre who their game is being compared to, or maybe they just get unlucky.\n\nAs a studio who has put out a bunch of single-player games that didn't achieve great success, I would think that Larian would be keenly aware of all of these issues and actually sympathetic to other developers who go through them instead of constantly going \"all you have to do is make a generational hit, idiot.\" at every turn.\n\n  \nI enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 \\*a lot\\* and I think its success is a really great thing for the industry.

This is directly talked about in game.\n\nThis reminds me of the fact that Gale is casually friends with Elminster, who could solve this entire campaign by himself, even without Wish + simulacrum chaining. Or even Gale in his unnerfed state if Mystra was taken enough by him to make him her paramour, especially if he can achieve divinity with the crown off camera.    \n\n  \n\\> Whats funnier is people criticizing the endings when they clearly werent paying attention to the setting or game they were playing.\n\nI was definitely paying attention to how ridiculous it was that your level 1 wizard was actually an archmage in the past who conveniently lost all of his artifacts, magic items & scrolls, and access to any allies he made. Or that Karlach has an engine strong enough to make a random person into a personal attack dog for an Archdevil but also conveniently precludes anyone from doing anything about it because all the content around it in game wasnt finished. Or the full on character assassination of Sarevok and Viconia. etc.",

And it's funny -- I think Baldur's Gate 3 is actually a pretty bad experience as a co-op game because so much of it is supposed to be about making choices. It's hard to really get the true BG3 experience when whoever happens to be standing the furthest ahead gets to make all the dialogue options, their stats are used, etc.\n\nIn an ideal world, BG3's dialogue system would be updated for multiplayer so that every character was brought into cutscenes, and you could decide who is saying what/when. So when you need to persuade someone, your Rogue can pipe up -- when you need to intimidate, your fighter can burst in, etc. I've tried to play it a few times in co-op and each time has ended in the group realizing that it makes way more sense to just play games solo and bailing on the MP one.\n\nOn the other hand, lots of people totally disagree with my take on that and that's fine, too!",

It's a really weird feeling that because the dumb barbarian walked into a room first the other three just stand behind him silently as he is left with the options of \"Kill children\" or \"Convince them you're not the Ice King\".\n\nI don't think that makes it a \"bad\" experience though. It is just a weird quirk where you need to make sure the right person enters the room first. Or it just becomes very funny when they don't.\n\nI have played through solo and in multiplayer, and I've done DOS2 solo and multiplayer, and I honestly can't say solo is my preferred way to play.

That was a great game, well paced and fun. Arkham City was okay but the best parts were when you leave the open world and are in an enclosed space. It also turned the fun Riddler trophies of the first game into an annoying collectathon box ticking exercise.\n\nAnd we never got another game in the vein of Arkham Asylm. They created a very popular game that put a Metroidvania into a 3D space and with clever combat and now it's literally the only example of that as a genre. You might say Control does it, but I don't really think so. There are only a few areas where your powers allow progression in Control.\n\nA game like Arkham Asylum is too big for an indie to attempt but too small for a bigger studio it seems.\n\nI really love that Nintendo and Capcom still make games that can be played in 8-15 hours without filler transversal.",

The intrigue-filled city chapter is always one to look forward to in RPGs and it was clearly supposed to be the magnum opus act here where everything comes together. But I honestly thought the implementation of the titular city was worse and less interesting than in BG1 from 1997. \n\nThematically, it's a heavily Lovecraft-inspired, extreme grimdark game released in a time when there was over-saturation in Lovecraftian-inspired grimdark. Larian's previous game also had this theme. This factor alone, the sheer lack of thematic novelty, was enough to bias me against the game from an early stage.\n\nIt is replete with bugs; many quests became impossible to complete without checking a guide because e.g. characters who are supposed to be there according to dialog and the journal, don't show. I had no faith in playing without a guide. Needing a guide as you go around, greatly detracts from an RPG experience.\n\nI can't imagine that a Zelda game that disintegrates in the final third, that's so full of bugs, would be taken lightly on here. I think BG3 was hyped up because it is a complex game and teenage nerds think they are signalling themselves as intelligent by saying they love this quite complex game.
