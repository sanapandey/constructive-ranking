With transformer ray reconstruction which drastically reduces path tracing ghosting ~55fps in the first level. Combined with nukems FSR 3 FG mod ~110 fps, but sadly with UI ghosting, maybe optiscaler FG will be better but im not sure how to install it.\n\nPut the nukem FSR 3 mod into Half-Life 2 RTX\\bin\\.trex and enable FG in the remix developer settings.\n\nI could even see a 9070xt running it. Someone should try it.",
