My wife is replaying Rogue Galaxy and gun to my head it looks, sound, and plays like a common ancestor to every Tales of XenoBlade/Saga Emblem game still coming out today.\n\nBut now that you mention it, I do remember breaking a dollar for Bomberman: Act Zero used at Gamestop now. And I wish I didn't.",

The Japanese games released in the past 6 years feel to be in the same spirit as those released in PS2 generation. Obviously, globalization is a factor, but the games are still fundamentally Japanese. I mean look at the Souls series, the SMT games, Persona, Xenoblade, etc. You can argue that Japanese games have influenced game development in the West more than anything else.",

Nu Udra has it's flamethower attack that's devastating until you realize you can just be behind it. Gore Magala has it's wing tip attack that hits me for 70% of my health in near end game armor. Arkveld has some pretty massive AOEs and large patterns.\n\nAnd that's just off the top of my head.\n\nI think you're greatly overestimating the competence of most players. There's plenty of stuff to struggle against in Wilds. Spend some time in public lobbies that haven't beaten the game, or responding to SoS flares. People are getting clapped by some of the new monsters and new attacks.",

We're not trying to guard point here - it's like, 2 seconds of invuln. I can't believe you're acting like that's the pinnacle of difficulty here.\n\n>zoh shia is a complete joke lol are you serious\n\nSo is base world Nergigante, when you learn the singular attack and how to deal with it. \n\nYou conveniently ignored the Nu Udra attack btw, which is essentially the same thing as Nergigante Dive. Big ass AOE, massive damage, really easy to deal with once you know how. \n\n> tempered gore and tempered arkveld are the only challenging fights in the entire game. dont kid yourself\n\nBy the time you reach tempered gore and arkveld, they aren't challenging. Don't kid yourself. They are higher damage versions of the normal fights. Higher damage really only matters if you're still getting hit, which - unless you pick up a new weapon for those fights, you probably already have a really good idea of your weapon's defensive options and attack windows.\n\nActing like a singular attack with the most generous defensive strategy is a harder wall than the same thing in Wilds is pretty fucking funny.",
