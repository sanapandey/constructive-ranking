    "selftext": "I don't have anyone to be excited with, cause no one I know really enjoys this stuff.... BUT I wanted to share still.\n\nI have always been into game dev. I started learning coding a long time ago by myself and I found a comfortable home using game maker studio as a primary tool. I have made a lot of cool demos that I am proud of.\n\nLately, however, I have been feeling burnt and have lost a lot of self motivation to make and experiment. Out of no where I just decided to download Godot for the first time. And I keep shaking my head with how amazing it is. How could I be so late to this party..?\n\nThis engine is very cool, very powerful and 100% open source. So many cool things that Godot can do.\n\nWhat I wanted to share was although I'm a bit salty that GMS2 feels like a more difficult tool to work with now, its actually sparked so much motivation again in me to start toying with game creation again.\n\nI'd so love so much to be able to make a game that my friends and others can enjoy and appreciate. I think this opens so many doors. It is so hard to share this excitement with my friends and family because they really don't have any attachment to coding or game creation. I could nerd out about it but it would go over their head.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Who better knows the needs and issues of a game engine like the devs who use it?\n\nThe trick to keep off burn out is usually always be trying to find the next challenge to overcome or experience to elevate your knowledge.  Grinding on the same old tired content and going through the motions is mentally draining and tedious.\n\nI usually have multiple small projects going at a time and coming back to one of them after banging out some feature or fixing some issue in another really helps keep the freshness going.  Especially ones you are using to teach yourself features or trying new programming methods or so on.",
