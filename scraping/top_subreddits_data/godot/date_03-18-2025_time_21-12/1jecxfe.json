A [dive roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ3rksQHXok), such as to vault over low barriers, maintaining acceleration, or simply as juice when dropping from a higher platform; a [superman dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyPMgl6OvdU), for vaulting over medium barriers and slowing (or halting) acceleration. Neither are necessary, but a dive roll makes more sense for your game than a superman dive. That is unless you decide to add barriers and traps where you have to \"thread the needle\".",

I know speed lines and vision-lensing at the edges creeping inward are the classic \"GOING FASTER!\" goto markers.\n\nOne aspect of the FEEL that a lot of games overlook is the sense of inertia/jerk.  That is, the acceleration curve getting compressed from sudden velocity change, either from going fast and being stopped by the ground or elastic-snapping from other physical things.  Giving your players that sensation of gut-churn and weight shift through visual effect is just as critical to sell them that immersive sensation.",
