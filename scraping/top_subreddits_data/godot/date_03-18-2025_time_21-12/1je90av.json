    "selftext": "# Intro\nDespite the loud title, there\u2019s no 100% way to prevent your game from being stolen, but there are ways to make reverse-engineering harder.\nFor me, this is personal - our free game was uploaded to the App Store by someone else, who set a $3 price and made $60,000 gross revenue before I could resolve legal issues with Apple. After that, I decided to at least make it harder for someone to steal my work.\n# How to Decompile Godot Games\nActually, it\u2019s pretty easy.\nThe most common tool for this is [GDRETools](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp). It can recover your entire Godot project from a .pck file as if you made it yourself!\n\n\ud83d\udca1Web builds are NOT safe either! If your game is hosted on itch.io or elsewhere, anyone can:\n1.  Use Chrome DevTools to download your .pck file.\n2.  Run GDRETools and recover your full project.\n3.  Modify your game and re-upload it anywhere.\n# How to Protect Your Build\nThere are many ways to make decompiling harder.\nThe easiest and most common method is .pck encryption. This encrypts your game\u2019s scripts, scenes, and resources, but the encryption key is stored in the game files themselves.\nSo, is it useful? Yes! Because it makes extraction more difficult. Now, instead of clicking a button, an attacker has to dump your game\u2019s memory to find the key - something that many script kiddies won\u2019t bother with.\n# How to Encrypt Your Build\nThere are two main steps to encrypting your game:\n1. Compile a custom Godot export template with encryption enabled.\n2. Set up the template in your project and export your game.\n\nIt sounds simple, but it took me hours to figure out all the small things needed to successfully compile an encrypted template. So, I\u2019ll walk you through the full process.\n# Encrypt Web and Windows Builds in Godot 4.4\n\nWe\u2019ll be using command-line tools, and I personally hate Windows CMD, so I recommend using Git Bash. You can [download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n\n**Step 1: Get Godot\u2019s Source Code**\n\nDownload Godot\u2019s source code [from GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot):\n\n`git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot.git`\n\n\ud83d\udca1This will copy the repository to your current folder!\nI like to keep my Godot source in C:/godot, so I can easily access it:\n\n`cd /c/godot`\n\n**Step 2: Install Required Tools**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Install a C++ Compiler\nYou need one of these:\n* Visual Studio 2022 (Make sure C++ support is enabled) \u2192 [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) \n* MinGW (GCC 9+) \u2192 [Download](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Install Python and SCons\n\n\u2705Install Python 3.6+\n1. Download Python from here. https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/\n2. During installation, check \"Add Python to PATH\".\n3. If you missed that step, manually add Python to your PATH. Thats very important!\n\n\u2705Install SCons\n\nRun in command line / bash:\n\n`pip install scons`\n\n\ud83d\udca1 If you get errors, check if Python is correctly installed by running:\n\n`python --version`\n\n**Step 3: Generate an Encryption Key**\n\nGenerate a 256-bit AES key to encrypt your .pck file:\n\n*Method 1*: Use OpenSSL\n\n`openssl rand -hex 32 > godot.gdkey`\n\n\ud83d\udca1 This creates godot.gdkey, which contains your 64-character encryption key.\n\n*Method 2*: Use an Online Generator\n\nGo to [this site](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/keygen), select AES-256-CBC, generate and copy your key.\n\n**Step 4: Set the Encryption Key in Your Environment**\n\nNow, we need to tell SCons to use the key when compiling Godot.\nRun this command in Git Bash:\n\n`export SCRIPT_AES256_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-64-character-key`\n\nOr manually set it the enviroment variables under the SCRIPT_AES256_ENCRYPTION_KEY name.\n\n**Step 5: Compile the Windows Export Template**\n\nNow, let\u2019s compile Godot for Windows with encryption enabled.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Go to your Godot source folder:\n\n`cd /c/godot`\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Start compiling:\n\n`scons platform=windows target=template_release`\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Wait (20-30 min). When done, your template is here:\n\nC:/godot/bin/godot.windows.template_release.exe\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Set it in Godot Editor:\n\nOpen Godot \u2192 Project \u2192 Export \u2192 Windows.\n\nEnable \"Advanced Options\", set release template to our newly compiled one.\n\n**Step 6: Compile the Web Export Template**\n\nNow let\u2019s compile the Web export template.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3[Download Emscripten SDK](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk).\n\nI prefer to keep it in /c/emsdk so it's easier to find where it is located and navigate to it in the command line.\n\n`git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git`\n\nOr manually download and unpack ZIP.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3After we downloaded EMSDK, we need to install it, run this commands one by one:\n\n`emsdk install latest`\n\n`emsdk activate latest`\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Compile the Web template:\n\n`scons platform=web target=template_release`\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3Find the compiled template here:\n\nC:/godot/bin/.web_zip/godot.web.template_release.wasm32.zip\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3Set it in Godot Editor:\n\nOpen Godot \u2192 Project \u2192 Export \u2192 Web.\nEnable \"Advanced Options\", set release template to our newly compiled one.\n\n**Step 7: Export Your Encrypted Build**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Open Godot Editor \u2192 Project \u2192 Export.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Select Windows or Web.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3In the Encryption tab:\n\n\u2611 Enable Encrypt Exported PCK\n\n\u2611 Enable Encrypt Index\n\n\u2611 In the \"Filters to include files/folders\" type `*.*` which will encrypt all files. Or use `*.tscn, *.gd, *.tres` to encrypt only scenes, gdscript and resources.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3Ensure that you selected your custom template for release build.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Click \"Export project\" and be sure to uncheck \"Export with debug\".\n# Test if build is encrypted\nAfter your export encrypted build, try to open it with [GDRETools](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp), if you see the project source, something went wrong and your project was not encrypted. If you see nothing - congratulations, your build is encrypted and you are safe from script kiddies.\n\n# Conclusion\nI hope this guide helps you secure your Godot game! If you run into problems, check the Troubleshooting section or ask in the comments.\n\n\ud83c\udfae If you found this useful, you can support me by wishlisting my game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3572310/Ministry_of_Order/\n\n# Troubleshooting\nIf your build wasn't encrypted, make sure that your SCRIPT_AES256_ENCRYPTION_KEY is set as an environment variable and visible to your command line. I had that error, and solution was to run in bash:\n\n`echo export SCRIPT_AES256_ENCRYPTION_KEY=\"your-key\"' >> ~/.bashrc`\n\n`source ~/.bashrc`\n\nEMSDK visibility problems for command line or Scons compiler: you can add it to your bash:\n\n`echo 'source /c/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh' >> ~/.bashrc`\n\n`source ~/.bashrc`\n\n**Useful links:**\n* [Article on how to build encrypted template, which helped me a lot](https://godot.community/topic/35/protecting-your-godot-project-from-decompilation)\n* [Official documentation on how to build engine from sources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/index.html)",

They need a line in the sand that says the entity that stole the work had to do so deliberately and was willing to take the extra step to do so, no matter how minimal that step may be.\n\nGranted, this is probably less beneficial to smaller devs who don't have a team of lawyer attack dogs.

Given video game companies, especially indie ones, are unlikely to have major legal weight behind them, and the consequences for not preforming a takedown are not expected to be expensive, it is not prioritized. That is not true for music copyright, and so the process has both more humans available, and the pipeline for checking the copyright is more automated and optimized, so it happens faster.\n\n  \nMost of all, you can submit more than 1 copyright violation claim. So you can just do both and claim both for the takedown.\n\n  \ntldr: video game copyright is complicated, and will require a human go through more shit to check, and is not a major economic factor.

This way your code will display an antipiracy screen if it's run on a vanilla Godot engine, but it will continue the game if it's played on your custom engine.\n\nThere are subtler ways of doing things; you can see it taken to extremes in [Chris Crawford's old article on copy protection from in 1997](https://www.erasmatazz.com/library/the-journal-of-computer/jcgd-volume-6/copy-protection-methods.html).

Apple are professional feet draggers when it comes to this stuff. By the time it gets taken down, weeks could have passed.

In that case, the game they issued a DMCA request on is still up.\n\nWe're talking about a company that really doesn't care about legal recourse in that regard because it's barely a decimal point in their earnings, and as such they do not take it seriously. Simply, you honestly can't rely on Apple to take down offending games.",

Then even when they get the key, they need to reverse engineer that node. And if you want to go the extra extra mile, just make no-change derivatives of every single node and obfuscate the type names. Make an export plugin and change the types to the obfuscated ones upon exporting.\n\nAt that point it's pretty much cheaper to re-implement the entire code.",

There's really not much protection to be had from obscuring code, because people will find a way to break it.
