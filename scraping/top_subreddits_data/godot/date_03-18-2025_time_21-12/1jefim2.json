What other software would I need, or guides to look over whilst trying to learn? I\u2019m an utter newbie, but this is sort of a childhood dream of mine and I\u2019d like to finally pursue it. ",

If you want to learn, you follow the same three step program as everyone else:\n\n1. *Learn the prerequisites.* You can\u2019t make games without having a basic understanding of programming. So learn programming in general first. Language doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n2. *Get familiar with the tools.* The best way to get started with Godot is by going through the Getting Started section of the documentation.\n\n3. *Practise.* Start with something that you can already make (e.g. Pong), and gradually increase complexity until you reach the level of whatever you want to make.",

I don\u2019t remember any specific ones, but in general there are many like 1-3 hour vids explaining basic Godot functionality to help you understand the general average flow of Godot game dev.\n\nBut ngl, after understanding what scenes are and how to use the scene tree ur good!! Even if you write bad code or do stuff in a \u201cbad\u201d way, if it works it works!\n\nAlso don\u2019t forget to look at Godot documentation",

For me it is pyxeledit for pixel art, figma/illustrator for vector stuff, and photoshop/procreate for illustration. For 3d, blender is perfect for my taste !\n\nGood luck on your project !",

Glad you're here and using Godot!\n\nFor a 2D/2.5D game, try out Aseprite for sprite animations. It's not absolutely necessary, but I've found it's a great tool for making sprites. It is 20 bucks though unfortunately. \n\nHave fun!",

Check sites like itch.io for free assets. Humble Bundle sometimes has game asset bundles. I think there's one going on right now but it's primarily 3D. I recommend Adam C. Younis's youtube channel for pixel art tips. Check out the \"ultimate introduction to godot\" tutorial on youtube. You'll know it's the one because it's like 11 hours long.",
