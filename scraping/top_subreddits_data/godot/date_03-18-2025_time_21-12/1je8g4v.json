    "selftext": "This weekend we took part in a game jam in Switzerland. We tried Godot for the first time and we were quite proud of the result so we wanted to share it with you !\n\nWe have been developing games using other engines for about two years as a hobby. We were super impressed by how user friendly and intuitive Godot is. We are definitely going to use in bigger projects !\n\nWe were a team of two and we built the game from scratch in 42 hours except for a few sounds that we took from open sound banks. My very talented brother created all of the assets you can see in the game and I did the programming.\n\nThe game is available on itch so feel free to give it a try and give us some feedback [https://very-kool-games.itch.io/geosplit](https://very-kool-games.itch.io/geosplit)",
