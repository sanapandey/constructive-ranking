    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n\u200b\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

            "body": "Hey there, long time listener, first time caller:\n\nIphone15, nothing fancy. About a month or two ago my battery life started dropping like a rock about every day or so.  The battery would drop like a rock and most of the activity was in the calendar, background activity or other background activities. Searching for help on the web, I saw an issue a couple of years ago an interaction between the calendar and the Apple Watch.  Ive got a bunch of other screenshots from my investigating this. The calendar is certainly involved, as I could reliably delete the calendar app, restart the phone, and install the calendar app fresh and it would be great for a while.\n\nI think actively using some function of the calendar triggers it, but I haven\u2019t identified the action. Yesterday I transferred all of my calendars over to Google Calendar and the native calendar app is not on my phone. Then I get today\u2019s performance.\n\nAnybody out there with experience in this stuff have an idea?\n\nThanks\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujjjw1dh7ooe1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41c9260d379119ecd71a7f1cd54fb9ba82b80ced",

It feels similar to battery optimization process that was ongoing for less than 24 hours right after buying the iphone, but there's no message about it in the settings. I thought I'm going crazy and maybe its me overthinking smth, but after checking battery usage at night (screenshot attached) it's really not looking good. It shows that FindMy have 100% battery usage over night as background activity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwfmork5stoe1.jpeg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40787e28ab04bac199ce0badd3c786b83fcdced6\n\nDoes anyone have the same issue?",
