Part of the magic of touch screen keyboards is that the active touch areas for the letters dynamically get larger and smaller based on the letter you\u2019re most likely to type next, while the visible size of the keys doesn\u2019t change. If it expects you to type an \u2018e\u2019, the \u2018e\u2019 key area becomes larger and the surrounding keys get smaller. That kind of works if it knows which language you\u2019re typing in, but if it expects English input while I\u2019m typing in Dutch, it makes all the wrong assumptions because both languages have different letter frequencies and different common letter combinations.\n\nIt becomes a bit better if it figured out the language though.",

Even the cursor will suddenly drop to the bottom of my text if I had started editing something earlier in an email. The only other time I had that type of issue was my old 8 and there was a screen issue (I can\u2019t recall the name given for the issue but it was well known at the time). Phone would open apps on its own, type anything it wanted if a typing screen was open etc. \n\nI\u2019ve had no damage nor recent drops that would cause these new issues. \n\niPhone 15P on iOS 18.4 (Beta if not full released yet). This definitely started in the iOS 18 updates so I hope the issue gets resolved. Frustrating AF.",
