I have for making screenshots (as there is no button in the control panel), convert videos etc.\n\n\\- Apple Explained youtube channel helped me understand weird things apple does, for example the alarm and timers have the stop button in different locations.\n\n\\- there are a lot of services in the background draining the battery - don't forget to turn them off\n\n\\- \u00a0Accessibility > display & text size > reduce white point. usefull for nighttime scrolling\n\n \\- challenge yourself to set up a custom ringtone :)",

Hope you enjoy the new phone! \n\nJust go in with an open mind knowing that while they have become more similar over the years, they both still have their own unique strong suits. Try not to make one be the other. There may be feelings of being outside of your comfort zone, and that's normal, but that's generally just a muscle memory thing. It would be the same for an iPhone user switching over to a new Android device. Just give it a little time and don't toss in the towel at the first hiccup. Give it a solid try.\n\nMaybe you'll end up wondering why you hadn't switched sooner, and maybe you'll absolutely hate it. In the end, it's your device and yours alone. If it doesn't work for your needs, there is no shame in swapping back. There are likely just as many people out there that would never leave Android as there are that would never leave iOS. Isn't choice a beautiful thing? \ud83d\ude03\n\nEnjoy!",
