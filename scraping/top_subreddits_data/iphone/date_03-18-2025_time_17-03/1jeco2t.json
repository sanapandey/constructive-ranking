    "selftext": "I've been using Apple News and subscribed to the audio version before. But I've noticed that there are some topics that just don't interest me, you know what I\u2019m talking about, but I can\u2019t seem to get rid of them from my feed.\n\nI'm really looking for something that gives me more control over what I hear, like being able to focus only on certain types of news. I need a morning news brief to wake up to. It\u2019d be nice if I could interact with the content in a way that feels more tailored to my interests and mood, or even get different perspectives on the same topic.\n\nIt's 2025, and we still don't have a voice assistant for news podcasts that can do this? After all, if I want to talk to someone in the morning, I\u2019d expect it to be an app.\n\nAny recommendations?",

If you go into the setting, you can change it to 'Restrict stories in today' to prevent those blocked sources from showing up in the \u2018Today\u2019 section.\n\nThat said, some apps such as NewsBang take it a step further by pushing news based on your mood and preferences. As for the voice assistant you want, instead of Siri, you could try the PodTalk feature on it. You can chat with it about news topics, which is pretty cool if you're in the mood to dive into different perspectives!",

You can directly choose categories like Finance, Tech, or Entertainment on feed, and listen to exactly what you want on NewsBang. Steer clear of sports altogether.",
