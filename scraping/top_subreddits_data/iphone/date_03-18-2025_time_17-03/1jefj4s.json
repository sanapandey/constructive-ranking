I don\u2019t notice it unless I\u2019m looking for it. It was there when I was actively using a phone.\n\nMy home office monitor has excel interface burned in when I put on a gray background.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t see it unless I\u2019m actively looking for it.\n\nHowever, a dead pixel on my gaming monitor was driving me crazy.  So whether or manageable or not depends solely on how much you actually care about it. :)\n\nIMO - it\u2019s very manageable.",
