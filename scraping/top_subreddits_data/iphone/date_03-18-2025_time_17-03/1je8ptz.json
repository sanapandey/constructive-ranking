    "selftext": "It seems that the iPhone 17 Air is almost a certainty at this point. What is the point and the value of a slimmer iPhone to a consumer? Other than the cool factor.\nCanning smaller iPhones which so many preferred for various reasons and offering slimmer iPhone - must be good business but it takes away choice and offers a pseudo-choice.\nWish we had a true SE4 instead of 16E!\n",

Again... don't suppose we'll know until it's out, but for years I've chuckled how every year manufacturers spend god knows how much money shaving a faction of a mm off the thickness... only for most people to put a 2mm thick silicone case on \ud83d\ude02 (of course no judgement of people who use cases, be they thin or thick... just an observation)",
