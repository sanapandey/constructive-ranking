Almost want to buy a new iPad to just not have to deal with the lightning cable at all anymore.",

The full repair for the screen and camera is $579. I bought my iPhone through AT&T and have about $740 until it\u2019s paid off. I had not thought about upgrading at all, but AT&T still has a promo for trading in an iPhone in any condition for $1000 towards a new iPhone.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s only about $160 more to upgrade to the 16PM (plus an additional $5/mo from losing a different promo) compared to repairing my 15PM. It\u2019s working perfectly fine otherwise and I haven\u2019t been an upgrade-every-year guy in quite some time, so I don\u2019t *need* to upgrade, but I\u2019m tempted by the (relatively) low price to just upgrade. I\u2019ve only been without Face ID for a few hours and it\u2019s been killing me, so waiting for the 17 isn\u2019t an option I\u2019d like to explore.\n\nLooking for thoughts on the 16PM to see if this is worth the upgrade.

The SE is noticably smoother (to be fair, it has less apps on it).\n\nI would love to buy something else, but not interesed in anything bigger than the iPhone 16. So, I was naturally thinking about the Samsung S25. It's got the same size and is slightly lighter. Its specs are superior to the iPhone 16's. Pricing is sharp. I'm just a bit reluctant to go back to Android.\n\nWhat should I do?",

It constantly need to have charger in order to properly use the phone. If not charging, the phone will be automatically shut down if the battery reaches 80% and below, after few time turn on the phone, the battery suddenly shows 10%.
