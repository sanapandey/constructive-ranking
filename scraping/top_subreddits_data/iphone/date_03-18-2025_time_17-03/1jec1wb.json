    "selftext": "Been an android user my whole life. Thinking of maybe trying out iPhone. I don't care about camera quality, I never needed more than 128gb of storage. I'm in my early twenties but I use my phone like a senior citizen. I can't see any difference that would matter to me in the last 3 iPhones that came out. Same applies with samsung. I don't need a phone with a pricetag of an old car. The iPhone 14 is still being sold in my country for a solid price. Is that too old or is it still a good phone that will last me years? Also, I hate big phones. I have a galaxy a54 and the size of that thing pisses me off so no max models recommendations please... I would appreciate any suggestions.",
