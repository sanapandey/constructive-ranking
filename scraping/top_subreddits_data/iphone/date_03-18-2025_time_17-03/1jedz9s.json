    "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed it when using the Reddit app, but consistently see it on Google products. It\u2019s like the apps freeze either minorly (can\u2019t click on anything in a Reddit post, but can scroll and hit the back arrow to get out, then everything is fine) or entirely (Chrome or Google freezes on a normal website and need to swipe up and kill). Been happening consistently over the last month or two. Never experienced before on any iPhone. Have had current phone since December.\n\n16 Pro running 18.3.2",
