Also, it\u2019s hard to overstate how crucial these can be for battery life. Assuming that Apple is able to continue the efficiency gains that they got with the C1, battery life can improve YoY. \n\n(Just some rough thinking would be: expected bigger battery from 17 Pro series onwards + efficient modem in 18 pro series + mainly bug fix software update at WWDC26 after this years redesign).",
