If you believe that you should not visit dargahs because temples exist or because dargahs are shirk, you don't belong in r/india. \n\nThere are other Indian aubreddits that encourage fundamentalism. We do not, we still believe in an India that gives equal rights to each faith to practise, profess and propagate their religion.",
