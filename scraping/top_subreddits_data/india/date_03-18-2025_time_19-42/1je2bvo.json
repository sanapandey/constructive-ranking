            "body": ">\u201cUpon becoming aware of the viral video on social media in which Tej Pratap Yadav, honorable MLA of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, instructed his bodyguard (constable) Deepak Kumar to dance and the fact that he danced in uniform in a public place, an order was issued to reassign bodyguard Constable Deepak Kumar to the police centre,\u201d and to appoint another constable in his place,\u201d the directive from SSP Awakash Kumar read.\n\n>\u201cAe sipahi, ae Deepak, abhi ek gana bajaenge jis par tumko thumka lagana padega. Nahin lagaoge toh tumko suspend kar denge. Bura na mano Holi hai (we are about to play a song on which you will have to dance. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be suspended. Don\u2019t mind too much, it\u2019s Holi\u201d),\u201d the MLA allegedly said in the viral video.\n\nTej Pratap Yadav threatened to have the constable suspended if he did not dance.  The constable danced. He was then fired for dancing in uniform. \n\nTej Pratap Yadav obviously faced no repercussions. \n\n>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is part of the ruling Nitish Kumar coalition, condemned Yadav\u2019s actions as \u201ctypical of the RJD culture\u201d. This behaviour was \u201creminiscent of the Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi days\u201d, where such disrespect towards law enforcement was \u201ccommonplace\u201d, BJP vice-president Santosh Pathak said Saturday.\n\n~~Meanwhile, BJP, which is the ruling party and could have stopped the suspension, is using this to claim that RJD does not respect law enforcement officers.~~\n\nAbsolutely no one cares for the constable who was unnecessarily fired.",

I'd imagine not having to spend his entire day around a turd politician might even be a bit of a reward? If he's suffered a loss in pay or privileges I'd agree with you though. But it's not clear to me if being reassigned to headquarters leads to that.",

Maybe he loses extra income from that, I don't know if he does, but it's still better to be assigned to a regular job than to continue protecting that guy, is it not? Ideally, you might say he deserved to be assigned to another guy's protection but this is really second best if not best outcome for him after what happened.",

Bodyguard means you go where the principal goes and you get lots of little perks such as good leftover food and an easy assignment.
