            "body": "Context: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) testing is used to assess the purity, botanical and geographical origins of honey by analyzing its molecular composition. This method can detect adulteration, such as the addition of sugar syrups, and verify the authenticity of honey. It is considered the 'gold-standard' of food testing that's available currently.\n\nSadly, FSSAI has not required NMR for the honey sold in the Indian domestic market. On the contrary, it is 'mandatory' for all the exports of honey being sold out of India.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-wants-nmr-testing-mandatory-for-honey-exported-from-india/amp_articleshow/72212473.cms\n\nIn other words, the Indian government wants Indian citizens to consume substandard and adulterated honey. Meanwhile, they want to maintain all the quality standards for the international consumers, in order to safeguard the global reputation of these big companies.",

What are they threatening him with?\n\nThey argued that since FSSAI has not mandated NMR for the domestic market, he cannot 'pass' or 'fail' their products using that criteria, as it would negatively affect their 'reputation'.\n\nHowever, even after Arpit (the founder and host of Trustified) re-uploaded that video after removing the rating and putting on a disclaimer that the video is meant for 'information purposes only', Dabur again issued a second legal notice against them, stating that it 'wasn't enough'.\n\nThis is a common tactic of these big companies. They have the money, power and resources to silence you into submission. And if you are an independent creator, you don't really have much of a choice here.",
