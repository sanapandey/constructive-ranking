Perhaps it would have among Indian techies, but with a slowdown in the IT industry in India, still low wages and Tesla not really seen as the luxury brand like BMW or Mercedes, I doubt it.",

Even if India fully supported Elon/Tesla, it would barely make a dent. Meanwhile, just entering the Indian market requires a massive upfront investment. Elon couldn\u2019t make that move when he was at his strongest and richest, so even if he wanted to now, it would be a tough sell (no pun intended) to his shareholders.",
