In the choice of processes and technologies adopted utmost emphasis is given to waste minimisation and volume reduction. The comprehensive radioactive waste management operations are carried out fulfilling all prescribed regulatory requirements.\n\nSafe management of nuclear waste has been accorded a high priority right from the inception of our nuclear energy programme. Nuclear waste in gaseous, liquid and solid forms is generated during operation & maintenance activities of nuclear facilities. The processing technologies adopted for management of nuclear waste are summarized below:\n\n(1) Gaseous waste is treated at the source of generation. The techniques used are adsorption on activated charcoal and filtration by high efficiency particulate air filter. The treated gases are then diluted with exhaust air and discharged through tall stack with monitoring.\n\n(2) Liquid waste streams are treated by various techniques, such as filtration, adsorption, chemical treatment, evaporation, ion exchange; reverse osmosis etc., depending upon the nature, volume & radioactivity content. The emphasis is on volume reduction and the concentrate generated therefore is immobilized in inert materials like cement, etc.\n\n(3) The radioactive solid waste generated during operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities are segregated and volume is reduced using various technologies like compaction and incineration. The solid/solidified waste is packaged in suitable containers to facilitate handling, transport and disposal. Disposal of waste is carried out in specially constructed structures such as stone lined trenches, reinforced concrete trenches and tile holes.\n\n(4) India has adopted closed fuel cycle option, which involves reprocessing and recycling of the spent fuel. During reprocessing, only about two to three percent of the spent fuel becomes waste and the rest is recycled. This waste, called high level waste (HLW), is converted into glass through a process, called vitrification. The vitrified waste is stored in a Solid Storage Surveillance Facility for 30-40 years with natural cooling prior to its disposal in a final disposal facility. The need for a final disposal facility will arise only after three to four decades. This will also provide sufficient time for the reduction in the radioactivity of some of the short-lived radioactive species in the vitrified waste.\n\nPrivate Agencies are involved in this process\n\nThe Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions and Prim Minister\u2019s Office Shri V.Narayansamy gave this information in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today\n\nSource: https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=98900",

There are parts of the utility demand - the base load - that is mostly supplied by high energy density fuel. Currently the majority of those are coal fired. Nuclear is the only clean substitute that we have. The targets are likely based on projections with some padding across the sectors, in case any sector doesn\u2019t make it. That sector could very well be Nuclear, but that was likely accounted for the strategy.\n\nWhen parts of the west are going through a downturn in the nuclear sector is precisely when a developing economy should declare lofty goals and try to gain that technology and knowledge.

I don't think you, and most of the other respondents to my comments have any idea about the actual economics of the full life-cycle of a nuclear power plant.\n\nDo you know why the West is going through a nuclear downturn? It is because they severely underestimated the costs of nuclear. Most of the nuclear power plants in the US, UK and Europe were commissioned in the 1970s and 1980s and are nearing the end of their planned operational duration for which they were designed.\n\nAnd the economics of decommissioning nuclear power plants has been severely underestimated. In the UK alone, they have been underestimated by a factor of 5 to 10, bringing up the revised estimates for decommissioning to 100-200 billion GBP. In France, decommissioning of a puny 70 MW reactor has incurred a cost overrun of 20x, and still hasn't been completed even after 15 years. \n\nAnd this doesn't even consider the fact that the cost per kWh that customers pay for nuclear power - when you account for the entire life cycle of a reactor - is 30-50% higher than a coal plant - by even the most generous estimates. Some authors who analyzed these numbers estimate that even with a carbon tax like the EU has proposed, customers would have to pay less per unit of electricity for coal than nuclear.",

Costs initially increase and then come down once enough research has been done to develop better efficient tech and systems. Instead of shying away from it, we should throw as much money as possible at it and become a front runner in this, especially given how energy insecure we are. China, similar population, so similar peak demands, and similarly energy insecure - knows this and thus has gone all crazy over renewables. In the upcoming volatile world where everyone is becoming selfish, you cannot put any price on energy reliance. Think of it as defense spending if that helps you come to terms with the cost of the nuclear tech setup.\n\nWest went through a downturn because US shale boom, cozy Russia, and stable Norway gas made them over dependent on fossil. The oil lobby will not let US go all gung ho on nuclear but smart western nations like France know the importance of renewables + energy security and look how well poised they are due to their forward thinking.\n\nSame is true of decommissioning plants. Throw more money at it, we will soon get the right mix of tech and efficiency. These things take time, like space tech and research, but once achieved - they will make us set forever.\n\nEven if after including the decommissioning costs, the LCOE of nuclear reaches 1.5-1.6x of coal - it is still worth it. In fact we are at a sweet spot I think. Coal has centuries of tech improvement and design efficiency in its shadow. If we can give another 3-5 decades to nuclear, it will easily go the solar route and have a way lower LCOE than coal. Many research reports and think tanks predict the same.",

They only work during the day and require a lot of materials to make, which means more mining. \n\nAlso they need to get replaced every 25 years. \n\n>uclear energy is more reliable than solar and wind and isn\u2019t limited by location like hydro\n\nThey actually have a limitation. Nuclear energy uses water as a heat sink (just like thermal), so you need a body of water nearby and also, they need more water than a thermal plant for the same amount of electricity production.",

The water vapour you see comes from the cooling towers and the water loss is neglegible when you compare it to the water consumption of the people and businesses using power from the powerplant. \n\nNuclear is also the easiest form of non-polluting power generation to scale. Hydro, wind, solar etc. all require specific geographic conditions to be viable, and these conditions may not be true all the time. Nuclear doesn't have to face such weaknesses and can be online 24/7.",

Though we got the initial help from Canada, Russia, etc.But through years of operational experience, we have acquired a lot of expertise in this domain. Remember no foreign country will provide you with an overall in-depth x-ray of a reactor, even to reverse engineer this stuff is quite a complex task , but here we are almost very comfortable in running PHWRs. And that's why the future projects not just seem very optimistic but very much practically achievable.",
