    "selftext": "I\u2019m sharing this distressing experience to shed light on the ongoing issues faced by passengers at Mumbai Airport when booking cabs. My family and I just went through a terrible ordeal, and I strongly feel that this needs attention.\n\nAfter a long and exhausting journey, my parents (both middle-aged, with back problems and heart issues) and I arrived at Mumbai Airport. We were hoping for a simple cab ride to our home, which isn\u2019t far from the airport. Unfortunately, what followed was nothing short of harassment.\n\nFirst, we faced significant trouble finding a driver. Every driver we approached tried to overcharge us, despite our destination being relatively close. It took 45 frustrating minutes of running around, dealing with constant refusals and absurd fare demands, to finally find a driver willing to take us.\n\nWe booked an Ola SUV cab, and once we had loaded our 7-9 bags into the car and seated ourselves, the driver suddenly began arguing over the fare. Despite the app showing a fixed fare of \u20b91600, the driver demanded much more without any valid reason. His behavior was clearly manipulative \u2014 knowing we were exhausted, he assumed we\u2019d pay up just to avoid further struggle.\n\nWhen we stood firm and refused to comply, the situation escalated. The driver began hurling abuses at us, creating a scene. The aggression was intimidating, especially for my father, who is a high blood pressure patient. Concerned for his health, we repeatedly requested the driver to behave respectfully, but he persisted with his verbal assault.\n\nEventually, we sought assistance from airport officials and an Ola representative. After verifying the fare, even the officials confirmed that \u20b91600 was accurate. However, the driver continued making baseless excuses \u2014 claiming he\u2019d make no profit because of his diesel car and other irrelevant factors.\n\nDespite the presence of officials, the driver remained adamant, refusing to leave or follow regulations. This created a massive crowd, with people filming the entire scene. Yet, no one could actually help us. We stood helpless for over an hour, while my father's condition worsened due to the stress.\n\nBut the most unsettling part? We are locals, and we still had to endure this level of harassment. We can\u2019t even imagine what happens to tourists or visitors from other states and countries who may not be familiar with the city or its systems. Many would be left with no choice but to give in, robbed of their hard-earned money by these shameless thugs and hooligans who operate without fear. It's despicable.\n\nIt\u2019s beyond unacceptable that passengers are treated this way, especially at an international airport where services are supposed to be regulated and professional. What happened to us could happen to anyone. No family should have to endure such mental and emotional harassment simply for wanting a fair and honest ride home.\n\nI hold Ola responsible for their failure to ensure that their drivers act ethically. If they are facilitating rides through their platform, they must ensure safety and enforce accountability. Hiring such drivers and not having a system to handle such incidents is negligence, plain and simple.\n\nI am sharing this not just for my family but for anyone who has been harassed or mistreated by drivers. Please share this post to demand stricter regulations for ride-hailing services at airports. Companies like Ola must be held accountable for their drivers\u2019 behavior. Passengers deserve better.\n\nThanks if youve took out your time and read the whole thing.",

            "body": "\\>\u00a0we repeatedly requested the driver to behave respectfully,\n\nThat never works anywhere in the world. Its kind of the meme where one person yells to another to \"calm down\" which only escalates the situation. Further the airport is such a mess especially at the departure area too, and the tax drivers are becoming aggressive in demanding tips just for dropping off at the airport. \n\nI am not sure how long you were away, but you do have to switch your expectations with regards to customer service irrespective of how much you are paying for that service. \n\n\\>I hold Ola responsible for their failure to ensure that their drivers act ethically.\u00a0\n\nAll you will get an apology and statement that they will try to do better. And life moves on. Justice is slow in India. Again need to adjust expectations and one of many reasons people move out. \n\n\n\nI thinking knowing you have so much luggage and elderly passengers especially at late hours when many of the international flights arrive in Mumbai, you should mentally prepare to throw money at a more comfortable situation. No money saving is worth the headache and stress. Uber XL is more expensive especially if you have so many bags, but is worth it. Rs 1600 is near $20 which is nothing. And when your air fare is easily over $500, why not throw $40 for more comfortable experience. There is also the cheaper option which the pre-paid taxi which is available. But those are often smaller taxis which may not fit your seven bags in one car. \n\nDo note that you would need to prepare to tip the driver or be nice if you want their help with the bags especially if they are heavy. \n\n  \nIf you were by yourself or with other young people, you have the liberty to fight the system on arrival, but not with elderly parents.",

If more people starts to react this way, this will change. \n\nAnd 1600 isn\u2019t nothing.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t want to get into a fight, I think it\u2019s easier to arrange a friend/family to pick you up if you\u2019re a local. Especially when you have that much luggage and parents with you.\n\nOr just walk to the bus stop if you\u2019re going solo. (Did that twice. Bangalore and Nagpur)",

I hope your parents are getting some R&R now.\n\nNot sure if any of us can offer any paths to resolution, as there likely isn't any ' justice' that you'll be able to get, despite clearly some really horrible behavior by the cab driver.\n\nI hear BluSmart has launched in Mumbai- that might be better for the future. I've also rented taxis from Savaari and Makemytrip, and had reasonable experiences. Hopefully one of these are useful to you.",
