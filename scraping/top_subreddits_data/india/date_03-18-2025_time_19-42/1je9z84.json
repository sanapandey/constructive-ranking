            "body": "Wikimedia has petitioned India\u2019s Supreme Court to overturn an order requiring Wikipedia to remove a page about its legal dispute with Indian news agency ANI, arguing that such censorship creates a \u201cchilling effect on free speech,\u201d reports Arpan Chaturvedi for Reuters. ANI sued Wikimedia for defamation over its Wikipedia entry, which described the agency as a \u201cpropaganda tool\u201d for the government. While that case is ongoing, the Delhi High Court in October ordered the removal of a Wikipedia page related to the dispute, calling it \u201cinterference in court proceedings.\u201d Wikimedia\u2019s appeal, filed on January 15 and reviewed by Reuters, contends that the takedown violates its right to host content on court cases. The Supreme Court, which heard the matter on Monday, recognized it as a question of \u201cfreedom of media\u201d and directed ANI to submit a written response. The next hearing is set for April 4.",
