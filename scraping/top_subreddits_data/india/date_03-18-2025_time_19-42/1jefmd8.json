    "selftext": "In Greece, the tragic train collision near Tempi on February 28, 2023, which claimed 57 lives, has ignited widespread public outrage. Citizens are protesting en masse, demanding justice and accountability from their government for perceived negligence in railway safety. These demonstrations have led to significant political repercussions, including cabinet reshuffles and no-confidence motions against the current administration.  \ufffc \ufffc\n\nIn contrast, India has experienced numerous devastating train accidents, such as the Odisha train collision in June 2023, resulting in nearly 300 fatalities. Despite the alarming frequency of such incidents, public protests demanding accountability and systemic reforms have been relatively subdued. The lack of widespread public outcry raises questions about our collective response to these tragedies and the standards we hold our authorities to.",
