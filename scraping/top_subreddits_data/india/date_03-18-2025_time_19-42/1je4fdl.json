Will there be investments there or growth in tourism? No. They want to put Maharashtra in the same situation. I was reading today that Vietnam is a smaller country than India, and the population is also less, but their electronic industry is 3 times more. Our country considers itself strong, but the BJP is trying to divide the country into districts, religions, and castes,\u201d said Mr. Thackeray",

Sadly, when the BJP cannot govern, they resort to violence, riots, this is their set formula in every state, if you look at Manipur, that is what they want to convert Maharastra to, today no investment, tourists go to Manipur, this is what they want for Maharashtra. They are trying to dig up history of a person who lived 300-400 years ago, but they cannot speak about the present, future. The irony is that the grave is protected by Centre, if CM Fadnavis has the courage, then he should visit PM Modi, and ask for removal of grave. It's simple,\" said Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.deccanherald.com/india/india-latest-updates-live-news-politics-nagpur-violence-devendra-fadnavis-shiv-sena-congress-bjp-tmc-rahul-gandhi-narendra-modi-aap-aurangzeb-row-3450818?utm_source=whatsapp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=socialshare",
