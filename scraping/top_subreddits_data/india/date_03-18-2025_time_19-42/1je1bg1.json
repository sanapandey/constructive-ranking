If he launches Grok 3, which is perceived as favoring right-wing opinions worldwide, he risks alienating a significant portion of users. This is why Grok 3 has a somewhat neutral stance right now, leading people to react positively. However, he has the ability to adjust it to lean more towards right-wing perspectives later; it's all in his hands.",

Twitter had its own department to shadowban users, who were opposite to their ideology, So it's obvious Grok will sing the same tune as the twitter data. After Elon's take over, it has become some what neutral.",

He will quote his sources as Wire, Print, BBC etc as his source of information (which quite a lot of people miss here). Apart from this, Grok is using information from User Generated Content as its learning data which is absolute absured given the biased tone of any User Generated Content on X. \n\nOpEd pages are also Opinions, UGCs are also Opinions. This is the worst how an AI should be trained. This also means the one who praise Grok now will get bashed by it soon enough. And Grok's documentations on how it reads UGCs also mentiones how it learns from the feedback given to it.\n\nGrok induced fun for Congress IT cell is not going to live long, its just a matter of time BJP IT Cell is going to take over and then all this 'Grok is Truth Master' , ' Grok should be Indian Media' narratives will backfire like hell \ud83e\udd2d \n\nI am all up with my popcorn for the second part of this story !!
