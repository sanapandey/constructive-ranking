I am a kind of people who's usually loved everywhere so all this is kinda new to me.. Also I joined late so everyone already had their own set of friends.. And there's literally no extracurricular activities here, so there's nothing I can do.. Also there's a lot of politics.. The teachers here do a lot of partiality and favourism.. They all have their own favorite students and they grade them based on how much they like, and they literally don't tell anything when those students take so many days leave, instead they question me when I just take 2 days leave.. Im usually obedient, I go to college on time and do every single work on time whether it's assignment or project.. I even study well, but since I'm no one's favorite, I don't usually get any privilege.. How do I survive this toxic place",

Simple goals. \n\nRemember why you joined this college: to get your master\u2019s degree and build your future.\n\nTry to see this as a temporary challenge that you need to overcome\n\nFind a support system outside college. Or if your batch does not seem fit, try to connect with seniors. I am sure someone is matching your frequency and has gone through, or is going through what you are going through \n\nSince there are no extracurricular activities, create your own! Learn new skills online, work on personal projects, or start something that makes you feel good\n\nDon\u2019t let gossip and selfishness affect your self-worth and maintain emotional distance from negativity. To avoid the politics of any space, being neutral can help you avoid unnecessary stress.\n\nIf favoritism is affecting your grades unfairly, keep records of your work and any unfair treatment. If things get worse, you might be able to escalate the issue to higher authorities\n\nIf the situation becomes unbearable, check if you have options to transfer or switch programs.",

            "body": "I am a 25 year old, about to start my MBA and I wish life was good. I wish I was content and happy with life but I'm neither. I've taken bad decisions in life and have been unfortunate enough as well, but all I yearn for is for a moment of respite and a life that I can be happy living. \n\nI lost my job in October 2023. I was working in a startup and I worked for 10-13 hours a day, 6-7 days a week and just like that, I was laid off. The company was running out of funds and because they were never able to find a fixed role for me, I was let go. \n\nI wish I gave a piece of my mind to my employers but I didn't- all because I wanted to be done with that place as peacefully as possible. \n\nI sought a bit of break for 3 months, because quite frankly- I was burnt out. Alongside all the stress at work, I've had a long battle with depression. \n\nFollowing the break,  I applied earnestly to several roles based on my skills(operations, google sheets/excel and sql) and marketing (because I've a keen interest in pursuing a career in marketing) but to absolutely no avail. I reached out to people on linked-in, I applied to hundreds of places via linked-in and I could only get two interviews- I was rejected after both) 6 months since my last role and I could only get two interviews. I reached out to my previous company's HR for help, but they ghosted me as well. For 3 more months, I tried- hoping to find an opportunity and yet it didn't lead to anything. Gave several aptitude exams for roles- only to be told they're looking for engineers or that my profile was not of their liking. For much of this duration, I was ready to work for half of my previous pay and as an intern as well but for naught). \n\nAfter an year of a desperate search for suitable roles and a horrible mental state, I gave up on job search and shifted my focus towards management entrance exams. I worked hard for it, did my best and fell short. Was able to get calls from a few private business schools, but as luck would have it- had horrible interviewers for two non-CAT private business schools based in Mumbai and Pune, respectively and couldn't convert those. I was able to convert the other Pune business school, thankfully- which remains the only option for me. \n\nWhich fuels another concern- rebuilding a career after a significant gap. I've heard that business school's placement committees flag profiles with a huge gap and push them further down the pile. Companies, themselves do not want people with a significant gap in their profile. \n\nThese two factors, alone have absolutely compounded my misery. I have lost hope that I'll be able to get a good role from my college placements. Irrespective of all the upskilling, all the networking that I do, that career gap will be there like a blot on my profile and will hinder companies to even consider me. \n\nAll that has happened in the last 20 months or so, that has defined the last 24 years of my life, and perhaps the next 25 years of my life, as well. I absolutely abhor this situation that I am in and really wish there was a way out. The last 20 months of my life have made me question my existence and my worth. \n\nPlease, consider this as an SOS, and please tell me what do I do in my MBA to ensure that this gap is not seen as a blot. I do not want to live like a failure anymore. Please help.",

Despite how common it is, there\u2019s still a lot of stigma and misunderstanding around it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve experienced TTM or other compulsive behaviors, you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s not \u201cjust a bad habit\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a real mental health condition that deserves understanding and support.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to connect with others in India who are dealing with this. If you\u2019re comfortable, feel free to share your experience or thoughts \u2014 even just knowing you\u2019re not alone can make a difference.\n\nLet\u2019s try to break the silence around TTM together.",
