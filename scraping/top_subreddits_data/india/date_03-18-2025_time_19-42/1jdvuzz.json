    "selftext": "Recently i have realised that my perception regarding this country and its people have changed drastically in the last 3 years. I don\u2019t know whether it is due the growing hate towards the country on social media or the fact that every day there is a new case in light which starts making you question the humanity of our people.\nThe change in my perception had led me to be a changed person of society.\n\n1. Previously whenever i was travelling on my scooty to somewhere and i saw a person asking for lift pr something i will stop to help him out but now i have started thinking twice and mostly don\u2019t help the person out thinking that may be that person might cause me harm.\n2. Previously while travelling to any new city in india i will not think about what time will\nI reach how will i manage i used to think i will ask the people there they will help me out but now i have to think twice about the timing and see what are the ongoing issues of that city language, hate against a certain community pr what and make sure I don\u2019t make any mistake.\n\nThere are many more such small things that have changed.\nThe reason i am posting here is to know that is it just me and my social media algorithm that are causing this or have the things really have gone down hill.\nI want to believe that there are still good people left in our country who don\u2019t cheat, have basic civic sense and at least care about the fellow humn",

I think it's because we're seeing so much injustice happening around us, so much crime, and so much propaganda and hate spewn everywhere, that it has triggered our flight and fight. I don't feel like I belong to this country anymore. \n\nAlthough I'd say it's healthier to just remove yourself from the world and just spend time with your loved ones. That helps. People are still nice, _some people._",

Trust in society is very very different and often not necessarily in exact proportion to the crime rates.

Take driving for example: I have driven in 6-8 countries but nowhere is it as stress free as in Scandinavia even in peak traffic or rush hours in the city. I am virtually assured that every person is trying their level best to follow every traffic rule to the letter. \n\nI know that at 10 pm there will be pin drop silence in residential areas and I do not have to worry about noise. \n\nI know that if there is an issue with my bus/tram/train there is someone somewhere doing their best to give us a replacement bus or other solutions. \n\nI know that I do not have to worry about the quality of water I drink or food I eat because someone has made sure that it's safe before it reaches my hand.",

I completely agree about the probability that we were misguided by the media, which was still somewhat independent back then, and the situation was not as great as it was painted, but you can through multiple articles stating India's resistance when the whole world economy was in shambles. And if it is indeed white washing done by the media, why isn't the current government, who is much better at controlling the media than the previous one able to do the same and convince us that all is well.\nPlus, there was so much optimism when BJP came to power with a majority because the malaise of policy stagnation in UPA 2 was primarily attributed to the workings of a coalition government. Even if it were true that we aren't worse off than previously, a strong and stable government at the centre hasn't been able to do much. For example, we have Vande Bharats that aren't much faster than the Shatabdis, but are priced significantly higher as an example of India's progress when millions travel in cramped compartments in trains that are in poor condition and face constant delays. Has the government invested in railway tracks? There are just two major players in airlines, small businesses have been allowed to fight for their existence because  bigger players have been allowed to operate without any social protection for the masses who form the backbone of these organisations. A major corporation like the Tatas seems content in competing with small retailers instead of actually investing in R&D to produce goods that can compete internationally.\nAnd it's not just the BJP government I am talking about.Terrible regimes like the one in Bengal, for example, are ruining a once great industrialized region to the ground because there is no accountability. A significant region like Andhra doesn't have a proper capital even though the state was divided a decade back. Manipur is destroyed. The government in UP seems happy to reflect on the achievements of a few pockets like Noida when the situation of the people in the rest of the state is dire. \nThere just doesn't seem to be a lot of hope.",

Yes, India isn't some economic and social paradise like other countries which become free at around the same time but we haven't had insane dictator rule, martial law, civil war, and mass death - unlike South Korea (martial law), the Golden Triangle countries and Myanmar, and so on.\n2. Texas, which a couple of years ago basically closed off avenues for legal abortion, reported 26000 rapes which resulted in forced childbirth in one year since that change. Texas has a population of 30 million and is in a first world. If we extrapolate based on population, India should have 50x the number of rapes and childbirths. I'm not saying women are safe in India but I'm also not seeing evidence of 50x the number of rapes as Texas. ([Source](https://np.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1fxj195/ama_26000_raped_women_in_tx_forced_to_give_birth/))\n3. There used to be a time when Indian banks were unusable because people used to spit everywhere until some smart guy had the idea of putting pictures of gods in stairwell corners. Banks are much nicer now. The takeaway is that Indians are hard to convince to do the right thing but you can always find creative ways to block their worst instincts.\n4. India has such a young and dynamic population that instead of a low trust society, I like to think of us as having an\u00a0[Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)\u00a0problem where we can't seem to make any progress because newer and newer people keep entering spaces where we are trying to institute change.\n5. We are the only country I know of where the oppressors (the upper castes) voluntarily ceded some power to the oppressed (the lower castes) with basically zero resistance and definitely no civil war unlike say, America. Is it perfect? No. Is it working as intended? Well, our best leg spinner is a Yadav and even the BJP which stood against caste reservations at first has embraced caste politics. We should be proud of ourselves. The nearest equivalent would be the British giving up the Atlantic slave trade and taking centuries to compensate the losses of the slave traders . \n6. After seeing the US fall apart in two months and turn its back on Europe, even Nehru's Non-Alignment seems visionary.\n\nI firmly believe that there is something in Indian society which sets us waaaaayyyyy apart from other societies. I'm still trying to figure out what it is but when I do, I'm going to talk about it from the rooftops. We Indians need to be a lot more proud of ourselves as a nation than we are.",
