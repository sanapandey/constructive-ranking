As for the cow, it's due to the religious sentiments of the Hindu's as they believe that the cow is sacred\n\nWitch burning: Yeah we never had \"Witch Burnings\" but we had something alot worse, Sati is the practice of burning the widow upon death of her husband. Want to know the crazy part? IT WASN'T A RURAL TRADITION. Many people all over India practiced Sati, it wasn't until the British Crown got its grubby little hands on India when Sati was abolished.\n\nGay People: I genuinely have no answer for this\n\nTribal Animalistic People: We respect the tribal folk because of alot of reasons such as the fact that they are still human, they were here first, and the most important one, protection of heritage and culture. Many tribes such as the Sentinalese show us what life was like, and not to mention the fact that a lot of India's history has been lost or stolen or broken or burnt or straight up destroyed. The tribal folk are also a form of history and show us first hand how civilizations evolve",

And I joined in this because my father requested me to pursue in this field.  I'm from commerce background. I got 86% in in 12th board. I wanted to pursue BBA in marketing or finance.

And I'm forced to pursue in this field only and complete my degree. They are planning to marry me off with some rich or well settled guy after graduating.

I want guidance on what can I do in this situation to earn something or any skills to learn so that I will not be dependent on my family or my future. I just want to earn by myself and get well settled before marrying. Before judging me that why didn't I said this thing before only to my parents. I contacted my father 5 times before getting YD. Told him that I don't think I can do this and I'm not even interested of the subjects they are teaching which is fully theory based. But he didn't listened to me and here I'm stuck in this situation.

Despite some cultural differences, we've connected on so many levels. The only thing I'm having an issue with is how she sometimes treats her friends.\n\nI know women can be hard to befriend in a new place and most of the people in her program are men anyways, so it's who she is exposed to. Recently, she met an Indian guy we'll call Raj (23) and he seems cool. My problem is, I've hung out with her, Raj and some other friends, and last night felt odd. She drank a little too much, but even before the drinking, she seemed a bit over affectionate. She often hugs him (which is fine to me) but she'll hold his hand, and last night when we were dancing, they'd hold hands, have their arms around a shoulder, dance close, and his hands frequently ended up everywhere on her body. I know everyone had been drinking, but near the end, his hand landed on her boob. That's where I stepped in and politely put some space between them.\n\nIn general, she often seems a little flirty, or at least crude with her jokes, and I've mentioned this before when Raj had held her hand when we 3 went ice skating, which I wrote off as \"helping her to stay balanced\" because she is new to it. The other part is, when they first met, he very much had a crush on her. She immediately informed her she wouldn't be interested and had a boyfriend, but it feels like to me, he's testing his boundaries and she blows it off as being friendly.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if I'm just experiencing a kind of culture shock, or if this is normal to some extent.

I want to know as to how cooking is handled in the house where a married working couple lives (preferably a doctor couple). Suppose both husband and wife are doctors or lets say working professionals in a metro city with a stable non-hectic 9 to 4 job. No kids. No parents living together. I am quite sure the household chores of cleaning and washing are handled by the maid or house-help. But food being an issue of trust, hygiene, safety as well as a family bonding/love, is it also delegated to maid/house-help nowadays among working professionals? Surely cant be ordering from outside daily.\n\nPlease note that this question is asked purely from a curiosity or survey angle. Let us not please delve into patriarchy, misogyny, feminism and other moral and ethical angles. Lets not get into what should be done.

But I'm an Indian-born NRI that returns every couple years, and am going to be in West Bengal next year.\n\nI've always been fascinated by animals and especially the wild animals you can see everywhere in India. Unfortunately my family in particular discourages this interest, they tend to take fear and caution to an extreme level. For instance, I frequently pet cows, buffalo and goats and have never had any truly bad experiences with them. Even if annoyed they'll usually just lightly headbutt me or aggressively swing their head/shake a little.\n\nI am curious about other animals though. I tend to stay away from dogs unless someone can vouch for them, because that's a rabies or other disease risk. I also wouldn't try to pet pigs because they can often roll around in filth. I do pet cats, though most of them run away from me.\n\nI've never run into elephants, and I'm not foolish enough to attempt any kind of friendly interaction with tigers or leopards. I don't mess around with snakes or lizards either because I don't know which ones will be venomous and/or poisonous.\n\nWhat animals are generally safe to engage with? And another thing I've been curious about are monkeys like langurs which are common in parts of Kolkata I frequent while I'm there. My family says they can be dangerous or violent, but I see tourists petting monkeys in India all the time and people on the streets throw them bread/roti all the time.\n\nOr should I just stick to petting livestock?",
