    "selftext": "I came across the recent Vadodara accident where the driver, after the horrifying crash, reportedly said, \"Another round, another round,\" and then chanted \"Om Namah Shivay.\"\nIt\u2019s being dismissed as an individual\u2019s reckless behavior. But reports suggest the guy was high\u2014either on weed or drunk. Despite this, there\u2019s no noise blaming Hinduism or calling him a terrorist. It\u2019s all being passed off as \"he was intoxicated\", \"just one guy's madness.\"\n\nBut let\u2019s be real for a second\u2014if this driver was Muslim and had said \"Allahu Akbar,\u201d you already know what would\u2019ve happened. People would have instantly blamed Islam, called it jihad, and pushed all sorts of narratives against the Muslim community.\nNews channels would run debates for days, WhatsApp forwards would be on fire, and the entire religion would be under scrutiny\u2014just because of one person\u2019s actions.\n\nI say this as someone who\u2019s agnostic but comes from a Muslim family. This is the harsh truth of India today. When it\u2019s the majority, it\u2019s just an individual. When it\u2019s a minority, it suddenly becomes about the entire community.\n\nIf we\u2019re ever going to move forward as a country, we need to stop with this double standard. Blame the person, not the religion.\n\nEdit:- People are downvoting this post because it's the truth they don't want to accept.",

That goes on to show how deliberate and preplanned the whole debacle was! This is the level of political control VHP and BJP held in the state, both emotionally  and politically, There are no riots in CHINA too, does that mean much?\n\n**\"Karvun j pade, karvun j pade\"**",

And I openly call VHP out again because VHP is politically even more relevant than CONGRESS at this point, same VHP which distributed PAMPHLETS by the tens of thousands encouraging MEN to RAPE, same VHP that DETAILED PLANS for instigating RIOTS (obviously using godhra as excuse)\n\nSame VHP that continues to humiliate minorities and JUDICIARY of the country by GARLANDING convicted rapists as soon as they are released (what a statement). Same VHP which milks dry any issue containing a muslim criminal, leaving no stone unturned to burn the whole 200 Mn muslims at stake as the others justify them or stay silent (or even cheer for them)",

Not because it'll win votes alone, but because being elected validates their own biases. \n\nIt is politics, plain and simple, fuelled by and enabling biases of a select few who want the world to think the way they do. \n\nThe Reddit audience is usually more liberal than average. So you may get a better reception there. \n\nUnfortunately, the only way to deal with this is ... to vote.\n\nAfter the recent elections, when the government was reduced to a minority, there was a drop in the volume of RW rheotoric on social media. This didn't last as long as expected, but it showed what many people suspect: the RW has different messagea for different communities. To liberals, they communicate governance and freedom from corruption; to the less educated, they communicate a very different story.\n\nIt's also why strongly faith based movies, movies glorifying Hindu leaders fighting against the Mughals, don't do nearly as well at box offices as everyone expects.",

What have the Muslims done to  change this image . Have e any major cleric condemned any of the major incidents caused by them?\n\n\nNow , I have another question. If you are following this story , then you must have also seen the videos showing the current status of the individual and guess what treatment the police have given him. \nIf he was a Muslim, and police had done this , the whole media would have gone up saying this is police cruelty and minority is in danger.\n\n\nThe question you are asking is regarding the perception created by the terrorists about Islam. This perception,  if willing to  change,  has to come from within the Muslim community and not from outside.\n\n\nPS: i have a lot of Muslim friends and all of them agree about it . They themselves have tried raising this issue but some of them actually got beaten up by their own community inside their own house. Now this has caused a lot of people scared about raising this issue and they just silently bear along with it",

Would he have lived if he got down and shouted 'Om Namah Shivay'? He would have been lynched.\n\nYour post is just made to create division between two religion over an incident which has nothing to do with religion at all.

Put him in jail for life or hang him till death.\n\nNow coming to your question: Was it a targeted killing spree? Was he targeting non Hindus for their religious beliefs? Was he out to kill in the name of religion? The answer here is no.\n\nThere are many Muslims who are apprehended for crimes but those are not associated with the religion. Reason? Because the motive was not religious fanaticism.\n\nAnother point: Hindus across India and even world would criticise his act openly and unequivocally. Why don\u2019t we hear same kind of criticism when a Muslim does a crime and has used/ is using religion as justification or victim card?\n\nWhy are there mass gathering to mourn terrorist? Why every Muslim who celebrates Hindu festival slut shamed but Hindus are encouraged to celebrate Eid? When the Godhra rapists were given bail, Hindus unequivocally condemned the act. Even those who vote for BJP.\n\nThe difference is when a Muslim commits a crime in the name of religion, there are many open supporters and few silent critics. When a Hindu commits crime in the name of religion, there is very vocal condemnation and very little support.\n\nI shall always vouch for a United India as it is necessary for better pace of development and prosperity.
