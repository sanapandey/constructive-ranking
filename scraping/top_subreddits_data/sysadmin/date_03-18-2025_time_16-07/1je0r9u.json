Makes sense, but I\u2019m wondering how strict auditors actually are on this in practice.\n\n* Do they usually want documented proof of recovery tests, or is having a backup policy and encryption enough?\n* Have you had an audit where recovery testing (or lack of it) was a sticking point?\n* Any tips on keeping the process lightweight but compliant?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences!",

So you just saying \"Yeah, we do restore tests every month, honest\" isn't = no restore testing.\n\nBut really, claiming that you don't have time to evidence things is a pretty weak excuse, and won't fly with most auditors. Because if you've got time to do a restore test, then you've got time to spend one minute making a note that you did it - whether it's a more formal document, a quick ticket in your system, or even just a line in a spreadsheet with the date, your name, what you tested and whether it worked. Hell, depending on your backup software, it might even keep most of what you need in the restore history.\n\nHow you best track this will depend on your systems - a common approach I've seen is to have an automated ticket made in the service desk every week/month for the restore test, and then whoever does it sticks in a brief comment with the status and closes it. Then when the auditor comes, you can point back to the last year's worth of tickets as evidence that you're doing it regularly.",

I can cover the 200 restores in a couple of days (I just leave it running in screen, makes me look hardcore when evidence is from 3am on a Sunday morning)\n\nedit: Oh, to add.. what is enough, well it's being able to demonstrate that we conducted the test as per policy, and that the data is full an complete. I can hand on heart state, it's good, beyond reasonable doubt, and bring the receipts to show I'm not assuming anything.. :-)\n\nedit2 and I was regretting using ansible, but then I remembered that I actually also automated the build out of the restore server, but now I just switch if off..  so bit of a waste of time.",
