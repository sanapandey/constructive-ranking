If they aren't... Then all I have to say is good luck honestly, I don't know how the hell anyone could use it long term with no training.\n\nWe got out of the business entirely because Sage based cuts for partners based on new customers being brought in, which for a small company trying to compete with major resellers and Sage itself was impossible.",

After having gone into management and had my hands off for a number of years, it felt good to do cool shit again. \n\nAlso soldering is fun.
