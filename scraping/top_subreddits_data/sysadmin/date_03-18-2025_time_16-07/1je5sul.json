We have plenty of fancy paid products for all kinds of purposes, but I've not bothered with organizing my own stuff.  \n\nI have Outlook with it's to do list, onenote, etc.  Is there something better than these or something you do to keep little tasks all day straight and check off etc?",

I could keep track of my work, get a good feeling closing stuff, be transparent with how I use my time, and also show the 'very important people' why their issue was not that high on my list; I'd simply tell them: check my board and tell me that your task is more important than what's on there.\n\nI've left that startup, but I still like how it changed the way I organise my work. I even set up Vikunja at home for recurring stuff I need to so.\n\nSo; Jira, Vikunja, there are some good scrum tools out there. It's mosly about how you use them though.",
