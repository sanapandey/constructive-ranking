I\u2019m just basically monitoring a bunch of VM\u2019s on Zabbix (for clients). if there are any issues I just report the alert. My other duties an are just checking daily Veeam back ups, checking dell hardware. I am not responsible for setting up any software or infrastructure. I mainly deal with the simple stuff like reporting and documenting hundreds and hundreds of network devices on our company\u2019s system. I\u2019ve done a tiny amount of VLAN configuration. What should I focus on? I work a lot of night duty so I have it so I have a bunch of time to focus on skills.",

You should have a very strong system/network skill set *first*, and then work your way into security if you want to go in that direction, but that shouldn't be a big part of your next five years.\n\nBut I think there's a **lot** of opportunity out there, and I am not particularly concerned about the field dying. Your near term will be dictated more by what you can work on in a professional capacity versus what you're most interested in. If your employer is willing to let you get into the guts of Zabbix, that's a great opportunity to take. What else do they need? Someone to manage their databases? SANs? Hypervisors? Alternatively, which of the seniors that does training with you is the most open? Learn from them, and hopefully take some of their responsibilities off of their plate, and build from there.",
