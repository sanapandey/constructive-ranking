How much to charge? \n\nHey all,\n\nTo keep it simple an old employers building got bought and the VP of operations for the new compwny needs access to the network. They called me and I'm pretty sure I can get them in. Heading there in 2 hours. They are facing a reset of their whole network stack otherwise. Firewalls to APs.\n\nThey were dumb and open the building tomorrow and need internet. I got fucked by my old employer money wise. Looking to make sure I get my moneys worth on this one. How much do I charge? Probably 3 hours of work for me honestly. I built the damn thing.  ",

No guarantees, no follow-up support, and no documentation provided.\"  Not because I want to screw them over, but because I really wouldn't want to do it.  If I knew someone in that business whom I thought was competent enough to do the work, I would, of course, recommend that person or company.\n\nPossible exception:  if you want a job there and/or want to get into the consulting/MSP business yourself, this might be an opportunity to help someone, make money, and get a good customer reference.
