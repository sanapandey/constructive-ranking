We have some staff who do not want a new phone, those who will ask after a year, and some who will see an Apple event and ask immediately for a new device. Curious what others do. One large deployment? Spread them out over time? We have about 125 carrier devices that are all eligible for replacements at different times. MDM enrollment is as automated as it can be, with our carrier auto-adding devices to Apple Business Manager, but the staff time to replace devices is the real cost sink. \n\n",

Users can self-serve order their replacements, ships directly to them, and then they just have to enroll it.\n\nYears ago IT management wanted to implement a zero tolerance \"3 year rule\" for all IT equipment, including phones.  Which is fine in theory, except this was at the end of the BlackBerry days when the Storm (the worst touchscreen every) and Torch (god damn nipple balls) were the models.  We officially had to push back on users requesting new devices, but I crafted a reply that was along the lines of \"unless the device is physically damaged, in which case you are eligible for a no-cost replacement after 12 months\" which led to some people getting creative.  My favorite was a guy who put a sheet down in his driveway and ran over his Blackberry with his lawn tractor and then sent me a pic of the carnage of 1000 little pieces.",
