Since the emails flooding the inboxes aren't dangerous in nature, email filters don't seem to be doing a whole lot about them.\n\nI'm at a loss here, I keep blocking domains but since they come from hundreds of different ones with each wave of attacks this doesn't seem to be accomplishing anything.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your responses. This has been really helpful.",
