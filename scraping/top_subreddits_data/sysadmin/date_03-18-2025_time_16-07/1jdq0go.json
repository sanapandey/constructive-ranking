Do the thing you're good at, and stop pitching all this other stuff we're already fine with. Kudos to the vendors that just have their one service and don't try adding all this other crap that they aren't good at. I know it must make them money, but they're losing my business by doing this.",

We all live in these hyper charged economies though where just getting 15% per sale is not gonna buy the yacht and insta-fluencer checklist of items of what a successful person should own, afford, etc.   Take away 9-figure bonuses and I guarantee BU's can operate efficiently.   It's just that we have too many people making poor decisions these days and getting way too much for their poor advice that has led to a feeling of circling the drain for a while. I feel like tech lost control of holding the torch and making decisions and so that's why all these ideas of MSP, and stuff like that aren't really technically related or has anything to do with learning the next up and coming rfc's.   It's basically overselling a support package these days that generally doesn't cover much leaving the customer in some form of discontent.",

If it's just a money issues then you should really consider if your business is doing well since even the most expensive phones are a fraction of a persons pay, and what's it worth if they can or can't make calls well\n\nOn the other side. How have we not made more simplified and reliable VOIP? I mean you hang around /r/sysadmin and you see no end of people frustration with every vendor under the sun.

Very good working relationship with every IT firm in the area referring customers back and forth no problem with us referring IT firms and they would recommend us to all their customers for voice services. To start all of our guys were just old Central Office engineers and plain old \"phone guys\" and cablers. Having worked with them for multiple years, we started getting called in to consult and fix problems for our mutual customers a lot more purely just off of having common sense and a surface level knowledge of IP. Like it was ridiculous how little real-world knowledge some of the guys fresh out of college or their certification courses were. Well, for some reason a few years back it seems like the referrals were slowing down or not getting calls back. Turns out it was because more and more MSPs started pushing Teams (not their fault, I blame Microsoft) thinking they know everything about telephony \"because I can just do direct routing through Teams\" \ud83d\ude02. So we didn't feel bad when our mutuals started ASKING US to take over their networks to consolidate since we have had most of our customers since the 80s or 90s long before real IT budgets were even a thing (your telephone system and PBX maintenance pretty much WAS your IT budget). Now we are on the other side of the equation and feel like absolutely shit with how we have to cover all of our bases because a vendor can come in with something we don't offer for cheap and hit our customer with \"oh by the way, we do all this other stuff too\" \n\nUnfortunately with how Microsoft is trying to snuff out independent telecom providers, we are kind of forced to play the MSP game with Teams or else we will get swallowed up by any of the one stop shop MSP giants. Tons of VoIP providers are doing fine with other hosted solutions at the moment, but if Microsoft has their way the commercial telecom industry will be gone and consolidated under them in about 10-15 years. Ultimately, we let our service speak for itself. Yes we are pretty pricey all around, but once we get customers we generally keep them. Customers that do leave for cheaper telephone service and worse service leave us more time to maintain our quality relationship with our other customers.",

They came back with, we can act as a reseller for you, but ultimately they want to push equipment and software solutions that require their team to support it. Making our internal IT department work parallel to them.\n\nI tried looking at a company to handle our computer replacements so I didn't have to keep buying, secure wiping, and recycling the devices which eats up a lot of my time every few years. One company told us they'd sell us computers but they had to have their support desk numbers labeled on them, and our staff had to call them for support not our helpdesk. They tried to convince me that removing work for 3 helpdesk techs was good for us.",
