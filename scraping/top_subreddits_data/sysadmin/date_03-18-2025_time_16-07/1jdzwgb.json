    "selftext": "\u00a0I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about data backups lately. Cloud storage is convenient, but let\u2019s be real, Big Tech doesn\u2019t just \u201cstore\u201d your data, they scan, index, and monetize it. Even so-called \u201cencrypted\u201d cloud services often have access to metadata or can be forced to hand over data if pressured.\n\nLocal storage is great until your drive fails, gets stolen, or just stops working one day. RAID setups and NAS solutions help, but they still don\u2019t solve the problem of off-site backups without relying on a third party.",

The provider for that hosting service will not have access to the encrypted media. \n\nIf you are equating something like google drive or OneDrive to backups, that\u2019s just a misunderstanding of how either of those services conceptually work.",

You just stick it in someone else\u2019s data centre. No one else has access to the hardware, you can stick your own firewalls in there so all traffic is encrypted and you can have all your storage encrypted and encrypt your data. Depends on what you\u2019re storing and how secure you want/need it to be\n\nThe only real way of doing it without a single other third party would be to have a satellite data centre that you have total ownership of, but that will be wildly expensive compared to sticking it in a s3 bucket for a few \u00a3/m (unless you\u2019re storing a huge amount of data.)",

The concern of a generic-user-of-cloud-storage *is not* those things.\n\n\"*they still control where the data lives, how it\u2019s stored, and who has access to the infrastructure*\"\n\nYou are paying them... for them to control those things... so they aren't your problem or concern. You give them money and they make all the decisions on how to provide the service. They could inscribe your client-side-encrypted data on stone tablets, or write ones-and-zeros on cocktail napkins: who cares if you can get your data back in perfect condition whenever you ask for it.\n\nIf your data is important enough that \"your service provider going out of business\" is a risk... you use more than one of them. Using multiple providers is what everyone does. If you ran a hotdog stand you may have multiple sources of your mystery meats ;)\n\nYour backups of \"sensitive data\" are encrypted either way. So you either pay big money to control your own offsite backups (and likely do a mediocre job of it). Or, pay small money to a couple cloud services to hold that data (and their entire business model is to be good at it).",

You seem to have a whole lot of trust in ISPs, given they don't appear in any of your risk concerns.\n\n2. What metadata do you believe that anyone is practically getting from your onsite, encrypted backups?\n\nI'm really not sure what you're trying to protect at that point, and I'm wondering if you use any cloud based services at all, since backups are not the place anyone would need to start at in order to create the risk you appear to fear.",
