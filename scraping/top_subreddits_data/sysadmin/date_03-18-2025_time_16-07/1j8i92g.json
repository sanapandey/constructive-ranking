    "selftext": "Hello [r/sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin), I'm u/AutoModerator, and welcome to this month's **Patch Megathread!**\n\nThis is the (*mostly*) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.\n\nFor those of you who wish to review prior **Megathreads**, you can do so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/search?q=%22Patch+Tuesday+Megathread%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).\n\nWhile this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's [Patch Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday), feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. **NOTE:** This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.\n\nRemember the rules of safe patching:\n\n* Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.\n* Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.\n* Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.\n* Test, test, and test!",

Therefore, I need to find a way to keep the environment running after April. I am considering keeping our domain controllers updated until January 2025, but with the compatibility registry key enabled.\n\nWith this approach, I hope to achieve the goal of maintaining a stable environment, even with some servers remaining unpatched.\n\nBased on your knowledge, in this case, would it be valid to say that both the updated servers after April and the ones that are not updated would function normally without breaking the environment?",

These issues, including use-after-free vulnerabilities in browser profiles, allow attackers to bypass browser sandboxing, exfiltrate data, or spoof identities.\n\n* Microsoft Management Console Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\nCVE 2024-26633 is an RCE vulnerability in the MMC. An attacker can exploit this weakness by tricking a user into opening a malicious MMC file, typically distributed through phishing emails or compromised USB drives. \n\n* Windows NTFS Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\nCVE 2024-24993 targets an information disclosure vulnerability within Windows NTFS. An attacker can potentially exploit this issue by prompting users to mount a specially crafted VHD.\n\nYou can [read a more in depth analysis here](https://www.automox.com/blog/patch-tuesday-march-2025) or [listen to our Patch Tuesday podcast here](https://listen.automox.com/).",
