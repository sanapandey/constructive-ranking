Everyone constantly up my ass to do tasks. I can\u2019t even grab lunch in our cafeteria without them coming up to me to tell me what they want me to do for them. No \u201chello\u201d or \u201cgood afternoon\u201d, just \u201cI need you to do x, y, z.\u201d On my way out the building for the day with my coat and bag on but they see me? \u201cI\u2019m glad I caught you before you left! Here\u2019s something I need help with!\u201d \n\n\nI take care of one task and all they do is think of another to give me. I can never get ahead of my to do list. Chop one head off the snake and 3 more sprout in its place. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. I should be at work right now but I\u2019m still in bed because I\u2019m so fucking tired of this. I want to quit but in this economy and job market? God, just please make it end. ",

I am ex-Army so I couldnt actually fathom just telling someone no.  But anyway I decided next person to walk up (isolated office space) I would say No.  Or more like \"I cant do that right now, I have other urgent priorities - can you email in a ticket please and we will triage it as soon as you do that\".  I wasn't working on anything I just wanted to see if it would work.\n\nIT WORKED!!\n\nSo I upped the ante over the years.  I set total boundaries.

So best thing you can hope for is that they realise to hire a secondary IT person. Sorry, but your attitude is imo the worst and what got us to this point in the first place. Nothing will change if you approach things like you do. Nothing. Ever. Sure you can just take it and go on until you truly burned out and your mental and physical health take a deep dive. Have you tried finding a new job at that point? Becomes significantly harder or even impossible. \n\n> but the reality is that those are not the only options.\n\nThe reality is that there are always other options. Nobody is irreplacable. So why bother caring about that. If you go about your life like that it will just be shit until your body/mind won't take it anymore. Imo a person who runs a whole IT department on his own for years shouldn't be to worried to find a new job. \n\n> you better believe they will be looking into ways to ensure they get back up without you.\n\nand they should? That is exactly what OP needs. He needs help, because he has way to much on his plate. So you should hope they will realise that they shouldn't have just one IT person on staff but multiple. Probably even three. Would still be a lot cheaper than an MSP. Of course they should first take the milder approach and talk to someone higher up about hiring more people(My guess is he already did that tho), but when they decline you don't have to much options between just leaving or trying to force change.\n\nI don't even really get what your point here is? Your implied advice here is literally \"you have to keep working or you could lose your job\"...which is no advice to begin with.",

It's also very unlikely that if they are able to get by most of the time with 1 person, that there is enough work or money to justify the second person. A service provider really probably is less expensive than 2 full time IT staff. Telling someone to go on vacation with their phone off is a great way to not only have a business realize they need another option, but to make them question if they want the regular admin involved at all.\n\nI wasn't intending to provide an alternate solution, but your point is valid. My advice would be to proactively find a provider who they can work with and fits the business's budget, that is understood to only be used for backup/off hours coverage and projects. An hourly rate MSP is probably more cost effective in this scenario than one with a monthly service contract.",

I have team members to handle more of the helpdesk stuff and still feel spread too thin mentally as an admin to the areas I am. There is just too much in each general field these days to do a good job on all of them if you are the solo brains behind it.. and if you can't get management to hire, you are going to struggle to get them to allow 3rd party managed services for certain things too.\n\nI mentioned this before, but I feel like one of those last few generically titled \"Scientists\". Now days everyone will say something like \"I am a microbiologist\" or \"I am an astrophysicist.\" This is all because the sciences got so big and there became so much to know in every field that people eventually had to split things up. That's what it feels like with IT now. You can *kind of* be a one man show, but you are never going to be as good as a team full of people that each have their single areas of expertise.\n\nI'm the Systems admin, pbx admin, storage admin, network admin, etc.. and I am not keeping up. I'm trying, but I am failing. Everything SEEMS good because in a lot of ways it is.. but I also know that eventually I'll not know about something important and the only thing that will keep the show rolling will be the backups I obsess over. \\^\\^; One day I'll find out the hard way some form of protection I have isn't as good as I think and we will get hacked or something else.",

Here's their number....\"\n\n  \nUsing a ticket system helps in a few ways; it gives you a list of work to get through, and the order to do it in. When the list gets far too long, you can then make a case to your boss that you need extra work. They should be fiercly protecting you so that you can get on with your day job, and your stress will be reduced. It may take an initial \"Leave him alone!\" email from your boss to reduce the stream of requests, but hopefully it will help.\n\n  \nAlso talk to your manager about ticket turnaround times (hopefully you have SLAs defined for each level of ticket). Work to those. \n\nAll of the above assumes that your manager is supportive. If not, you may need to work on your resume; but be aware that the next place may be no better.",

If you're on lunch, then things will have to wait until you're not on lunch (but use some discretion if it's something serious). If you can't even walk down the hall without getting shoulder taps, then you need to insist on a ticket system and make people submit them. Get management on board. You're not able to get things done because you're interrupted constantly, which is exactly what a ticket system is designed to help with.

They just want from you all the time and can't acknowledge that you are human. Then, it tends to make you even more bitter about them always bothering you when you are on breaks. Then, they get made because you set boundaries and stick to them. I too cannot even leave my office to go to the bathroom without a line of people ambushing me for \"urgent\" issues that were clearly not important enough for them to put in a ticket but suddenly they can't wait just 5 minutes longer. \n\nI set the rules/ boundaries and they have to follow those to get help. I don't care how much they call me a bitch or a pitbull. If they need help, there has to be a ticket so I can track and prioritize issues. If they stop me in the hall to tell me about something, that is called a conversation or venting. There is no record they reported an issue to me. I see no ticket for that. COOL STORY. Don't get me wrong, they still try every day. But now there is no surprise that I when they yell my name down a hall, I yell back \"put in a ticket\".\n\nYou have to pace yourself and force them to abide by the proper procedures. If you don't have a ticket system, make your own preferred way to communicate issues to you. As a solo, you have to take your breaks as well. You need that time. I always leave the building for mine.

Finally their single brain cell kicks in \"Please can I get X\" \"OOOHHHH! You would like me to get it for you and you used the magic word?\"\n\nI am, and have to be incredibly grateful for the management that I have. We're family owned and operated, I have a single person I report to, make requests from, etc... AND he uses Please, thank you, appreciate you, good job, etc... Even better, if you make a mistake and own up to it, his usual response is \"Alright! Owning up to it, I like that!\" and results a \"Is it fixed/lets get it fixed\" (Thankfully never f'd up too bad).\n\nGood luck! Spruce up that resume and put out some feelers!",

The issues management cares about are the ones that stop production.  so if you rank order your tickets in order of importance then you can address the issues which your management will notice rapidly.  if those issues are being addressed timely they won't care if you have a year backup of mouse and screen saver bullshit built up.",

I would either eat in my car or at my desk in the IT office.  \n\nDo you have a manager or someone that can intercede on your behalf?  I would ask them to send out a communication that for IT assistance, it needs to be placed in a ticket, email, or voicemail format and calls will be addressed based on priority.  Reiterate that shoulder taps for IT assistance outside of emergencies should be avoided as it impacts support provided to others.  \n\nWe had a policy where everything needed to be documented in ticket before it was worked on, so I would constantly remind anyone who approached me that I would be happy to assist when next able, but to please enter a ticket so I could get back to them.  Otherwise I would offer to open a ticket on their behalf and would follow up with them as soon as possible.  (Unless the issue was quick and could be resolved immediately on the spot).\n\nA good ticketing system is also essential becuase it helps you stay organized and documents what you've been doing and can be used to prove if you need further help.

The ones who will pay this token are the ones that really appreciate you, your work relationship with them will really improve.  \nFourth: Don't fear of make other people understand you are a professional, and a overworked one. If someone blocks you in the corridors, just tell them \"sorry, i am needed in another office, open a ticket\".\n\nFifth: Eat and dine with your colleagues, and when someone asks something, just change subject \"OP I NEED THIS\" \"Hi stupiduser69, how are you today? I really like your cheap shirt. So, how is going your life? that monster of son you have? Does he still has all the tentacles?\" And when they answer witht heir request, just tell them you thought they were there to dine with you, with a sad face.

Good morning!\" and then go from there.\n\nI'm a social person, but that can cut both ways because people will rely on the rapport they have with you rather than get in line for help.\n\nEven worse is people calling you and then you *have* to answer.\n\nSomething I take to heart now is that at 5p (or whenever your day ends), you just pack up and go. \"Don't stress what's left, it'll be there tomorrow\" and just go on home. \n\nIf people see you at the cafe, say \"Hey, I'm at lunch, please email me with your issues\" or \"Sorry, I'm heading out, write me an email and I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

Funny how the purchasing clerks who demand immediate assistance get all annoyed when you ask them about the laptops you ordered when they're trying to gossip during THEIR lunch break.  \"Oh sorry, I figured since you interrupted my lunch break it meant it was OK to do the same for you.  My bad.\"\n\nDo you have a help ticket application?  Can it generate work tickets from emails?  If not, get the approval from your higher ups to implement such a system, and to require users to submit a ticket to get assistance.  \n\nAny time someone calls for help, or shows up at your desk, reply to any statement they make with \"What's your ticket number?\"  If they don't have one, say \"Sorry, I'm required to have a ticket number to work on any issues.\"  \n\nIf you're on your lunch break, put in your earbuds, and anytime someone interrupts to ask you for help say \"Sorry, I'm on an important call right now, I'll have to get back to you later\" and then ignore them.  Bonus points if you follow up by telling the non-existent caller \"Sorry, I got interrupted by one of the people that might be impacted by the personnel changes, can you send me the full list?\"\n\nIf you can get out of the office for lunch, do it.

That leaves it up to you to make sure you get a fair shake.\n\nIf you have more work than fits in a reasonable 40-hour week? Then stuff rolls over to the next week.\n\nIf they don't like that, and of the backlog keeps growing - show them a record of where your 40-hours go, point to the growing backlog, and ask them how they'd like you to prioritize tasks, and what messaging they want you to use to communicate delays to the lower-priority items that will be put on hold.\n\nIf the balk tell them you need a second person to take up the excess work.\n\nThey will, of course, want one person to do the work of two or three. Heck, I want that deal whenever I hire someone to do a service too. It's the nature of the beast.\n\nBut you ARE one person, and your work is (likely) based on what can be done in 40 hours a week.\n\nDon't let them bully you into more.\n\nPrioritize your well being.\nPrioritize assigned work with whomever you report to. \nLow-prioritt stuff rolls over, and if they don't like how much rolls over, they need to get more people.\n\nIt doesn't *feel* that easy, or that black-and-white, but it is. You just have to make it so.",

And if the CEO's rather important thing that went in appropriately as a priority 4 on a 0 (wishlist / low priority) to 10 (people are dying at a very high rate until this is fixed), and that one isn't getting done because someone keeps putting in their request to do some quite unimportant thing but they keep setting the priority to 9 ... well, be sure everyone gets to see that their stuff is getting delayed, because someone keeps putting their unimportant sh\\*t in at a 9, when it ought be like a 1 or 2, and probably not even a 3.

Uhm, yeah, manage that ... ticketing system, not an, \"Oh, by the way, while you're here, I've also got ...\", nope, not on the ticket, submit ticket ... if you wanted that also looked at at same time, you could've mentioned on ticket, or better yet two tickets, and update each to cross-reference the other ... then if there was the time available, for efficiency, may do both on same visit ... or if due to priority and resources, only have time to do one, the higher priority one gets handled, and the other at a later more appropriate time.\n\nAlso leverage one's manager - too much to do, too little time, go over it once in a while, probably give 'em a short synopsis of how you see the priorities, see if they agree, and handle the priorities in priority order, to the extent you have time, and the rest ... oh well.  And stuff reasonably well documented, may well help backing and justification, for you getting raise, promotion, and additional resources (e.g. more folks) to do the needed work.  Likewise, you have various users pulling you different directions, each thinking *their* thing is more important than the other - 1st level, you see if you can easily decide and have them agree, 2nd level, you see if you can have 'em talk/battle with each other and figure out what the ordering ought be, and if they still can't settle it ... hey, you've got a manager - can run it by them - but just try not to make a habit of it, see if you can get it sorted out sooner - or maybe manager can empower you to make most such calls.\n\nAnyway, as noted, doesn't mean you need be totally inflexible in all this stuff, but make sure you manage the work, not the work managing you.  Need to keep it at *least* reasonable, and if folks abuse privilege, well, you take that privilege away.\n\nAnd if the environment is too damn toxic, and you can't get it fixed (e.g. manager/employer doesn't give a sh\\*t), then be looking for something else - and when you find (significantly) better - jump.  And if it's way too damn toxic, don't even have to wait for that next opportunity.  Some things are more important than a damn job.",

There were things I knew I'd have to compromise on as it was a relatively small business, and there would be work off-hours and after-hours, but there were limits even I had to impose (and I was still relatively young and could recover quickly from long days or nights, lots of travel, etc.).\n\nThankfully the owner I worked for was a pretty good guy, and he helped make sure that his VP and everyone else honored reasonable requests as long as I honored reasonable requests in return.  Life got much better after I thought about it, wrote up the problem in a professional email devoid of (most) emotion - and that took a week - and then set up a follow-up meeting to talk about it.  After a few hours of chatting with leadership with examples and how it impacted the ability of me to be available to assist with things that the business required me to do to maximize profit and reduce costs, it was never a problem again (or I wish it wasn't, but anytime someone made a problem they had the owner to deal with, which meant those went away quickly if they weren't actual emergencies already).  When the business grew and I was able to hire a few more people, we kept the \"reasonable request\" boundaries and were able to add on reasonable time-off and after-hours requests as well, and as far as I'm aware all of that still exists, and the business still does very well for itself even if it's probably not considered \"small\" anymore.",

            "body": "I'm the sysadmin for a company of about 300+ users, we have 1 servicedesk guy on contract. Firm has massive technical debt and I've been working there for about 2 years. Been slowly modernizing the old sites, upgrading hardware, systems, implementing maintenance procedures and completing the infrastructure for a newly built datacentre (we sell datacentres).   \nI get the occasional user showing up in my office from time to time asking for help with all kinds of user-support issues, they usually just get a certain look from me, they leave, a ticket magically appears and our service desk guy fixes it. He's really good, and of course if he's stuck, I'm more than willing to help him out.   \nPeople tend to think that an IT person no matter the title is always a user support person, I have bigger problems than your email not working because you forgot your password. We've even communicated this quite bluntly in our intranet and \"updates from IT\"-posts on our internal workplace thing. On the upside it seems to work, slowly but surely. \n\nI did for a period lock my office door because people were randomly popping in when I was in meetings, was planning on getting a red/green status light to reflect if I was in a meeting or not, but I think that would just promote more traffic in my office because of the green status. Anyhow, someone complained to HR and I was told not to lock my door because its a fire hazard (I usually either sit in meetings or listen to music while working, so I can't hear shit around me normally, sort of makes sense, if I smell burning I'd probably react though :D). If its something really important I need to get done, I work remotely (haha suck-it users, if you can't find me, I can ignore you).\n\nI appreciate your rant and I absolutely see what you're talking about, but I think a possible solution would be to identify what is actually critical to fix and what is not, prioritize tasks and explain this to users asking for help, that you're busy with more pressing tasks that are more important than their issue and say that they can create a task and you'll get around to it when you have time.   \nIf they don't agree with your prioritization assessment, tell them to talk to your boss, he/she will have to decide if you should prioritize the new issue or the actual ongoing important task. If he agrees with the user, drop the important task, if people complain, refer them to your boss. After a while your boss will probably get tired of it mostly agree with your assessment in terms of prioritization of tasks. Also, NEVER accept a task without a ticket, be a total hard ass with that. Your leaders cannot see your work amount without tickets. Another helpful and good thing I found is having a Monday morning meeting every week and present your plan for that week you aim to complete with your boss.  And yes, your boss might be an idiot, but at least you've done what you can to facilitate that fact, if they cannot change for the better I'd start brushing off that CV and start looking for alternatives.",
