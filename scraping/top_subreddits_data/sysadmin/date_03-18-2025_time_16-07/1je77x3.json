IMO it\u2019s well structured with clearly defined teams and roles, with limited siloing because we all need a little help from each other to complete work. After my first few years here, I\u2019ve really been thinking about how bad of a decision it would be to transition to managed services and the nightmare that would ensue. I\u2019m curious, what has your experience been in the manufacturing industry? Would love to hear some pros and cons from both sides of the fence.",

If a manufacturing line goes down because of an IT issue, it\u2019s going to take the MSP a lot longer to determine the root cause than dedicated staff and that\u2019s going to cost a ton of money per outage. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve seen successful MSP contracts where they manage portions of the estate (backups/patching/firewalls) and it seems to go OK.",

I've seen things here that legitimately boggle my mind. \n\nOn the extreme end: within my first month, a user asked me if we had a power converter for their laptop cable. Turns out they had been given a laptop power supply with a UK-style plug. Mind you, we are a Midwest-based manufacturer, we do not sell products in the UK, and none of our users has a need to travel to the UK regularly.\n\nOur documentation is non-existent. We've got guys who have been here for 20+ years, so I'll ask them why something was set up the way it was. \"Oh, that's just how <MSP> decided to do it.\" There seems to have been a lot of do-it-as-quickly-as-possible-without-thinking-about-the-long-term-tech-debt type work done here.

There's no way that you could get quality service out of an MSP, mainly because they are all very custom environments with specialized machines and, in a lot of cases, regulated in specific ways. What we've had better success with is more siloed type MSP solutions. For example; we have an MSP that \"helps\" with our network if anything crazy happens, but 99% is handled in house. It's a cheap contract that's really only there to support a very lean onsite team... more of a supplement than a true MSP type relationship. But since we are very lean, we do look for these types of solutions, where we can pay someone to help us.",

Any manufacturing specific software had to have vendor support and an internal SME on staff, as we could only provide very basic support for that portion. The hardware and physical tools that interfaced with any IT systems that was used for the manufacturing also had to have a SME and accompanying vendor support. \n\nEach of the clients I\u2019m describing had production-halting level issues within the last 12 months; one was backup related and the other was AD related. Surprisingly, the AD related one is the one that had the most downtime. I honestly feel as though the MSP could not have responded to the issue any faster than an onsite team could, considering we were aware of the issue before the end users were. However, these are smaller companies and they certainly paid a pretty penny to have all of the monitoring tools that we had available. \n\nI completely agree with you that, at a certain size, it only makes sense to have in-house IT. However, you don\u2019t always have to have the MSP handle everything; it was fairly common for clients to utilize only our network monitoring and security tools, while they handled everything else and looped us in when needed.
