    "selftext": "Some days, I wonder am I actually building something meaningful, or am I just duct taping a sinking ship while everyone complains the tape isn\u2019t good enough?\n\nI wake up to a flood of emails, half of them marked URGENT (they never are). I log in, and there\u2019s already a fire to put out because, of course, something critical broke overnight. By the time I fix it, there\u2019s another problem. Then another. And another.\n\nIt\u2019s like IT isn\u2019t about solving problems, it\u2019s about keeping things just functional enough for the next disaster. I don\u2019t mind working hard, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that we\u2019re stuck in a cycle that never actually gets better.\n\nFor those who have been in this loop for years, does it ever change? Or is this just what IT is: an endless treadmill of firefighting, underappreciation, and burnout?",

The company had 100+ employees and 3 locations in it's glory days, but the corporate office had maybe about 50 employees. I ended up as the admin because no one else knew anything about computers or networking, so I learned how to do everything else (cabling, building servers, database management, etc.). There was never enough money, which made things even more grueling. I knew I wasn't going to stay at this company forever, so I slowly convinced management to outsource some of the functions - especially when they cut half the staff and closed their other two locations which gave me even less time to focus on IT. I knew I wouldn't be able to leave with a good conscience until they had some actual IT infrastructure, so when they agreed to hire an outside company I knew it was time. I had documented as many work instructions as I possibly could, made sure that the new IT company was settling in, and then I bailed.\n\nI moved out of the state, and I took a job that was NOT in IT (and for significantly less money, woe). Since my resume was mostly IT and accounting, word got around at my new gig that I could \"do IT stuff.\" The only difference now is that it's just random end user stuff (with no server, exchange, web filtering, routers, etc.), so it's not bad ... especially because I miss the challenges that are specific to computer/tech. But, aside from retiring, working at a fully staffed/supported company, or moving out of IT in general, those are the only ways out.",

            "body": "It definitely sounds like you're stuck in a tough loop, and I think a lot of people in IT can relate to the feeling of constantly fighting fires without ever getting a chance to step back and focus on long-term progress.\n\nOne thing that's helped me handle this type of environment is prioritizing work and setting clear expectations. When everything feels like an urgent fire, it can be easy to get lost in the weeds and lose sight of what really matters. \n\n**Set Clear Boundaries & Prioritize**: Not everything that\u2019s marked \"urgent\" is really urgent. I\u2019ve learned to set boundaries by distinguishing between truly critical issues and things that can wait. Sometimes, it's just about triaging: tackling the most impactful problems first and letting others simmer until you have the bandwidth. Prioritization tools like the Eisenhower Matrix (important vs. urgent) can help make this more concrete.\n\n**Expectations**: A lot of times, the issue is a mismatch between what people expect from IT and what we can realistically deliver. I\u2019ve found that setting realistic expectations early on can reduce the stress and pressure later. Whether it\u2019s letting stakeholders know about ongoing issues or giving them a clearer idea of timelines, having those conversations upfront can help set a healthier tone.\n\n**Long-Term Solutions vs. Short-Term Fixes**: It\u2019s tempting to just keep putting out fires, but I try to carve out time (even if it\u2019s just an hour here and there) to look for the root causes of recurring problems. Building longer-term solutions might not solve everything immediately, but it can prevent those same fires from coming back over and over again.\n\n**Celebrate the Wins**: It\u2019s easy to get bogged down by the feeling of \"I\u2019m just fixing stuff,\" but when I take a step back and reflect on the impact I\u2019ve had, whether that\u2019s getting something working again or improving a process, it can be really rewarding. It\u2019s important to remember that even if you're not solving the \"big\" problems every day, you\u2019re still making things better.\n\n**Self-Care**: I\u2019ve learned the importance of balancing work and personal life. The grind of constant firefighting can lead to burnout, so it\u2019s crucial to take care of yourself physically and mentally. Sometimes, stepping away for a little while can help you come back with fresh eyes and a clearer head.\n\nAs for whether this ever changes \u2013 there will always be firefighting in IT, but over time, you can get better at managing it. The key is learning to manage your work, set boundaries, and keep a bigger perspective on the long-term goals. If you don\u2019t, the cycle can feel endless.\n\nStay strong and keep building! You\u2019re making an impact, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel that way.",

I'm currently driving multiple initiatives to revamp large parts of our infrastructure and processes and it's fucking awesome.\n\n\nA common problem around this sub is that there is a disconnect between the business and IT. IT blames the business for not giving them money but the business has no idea what the fuck IT is trying to do with it because no one is translating it into a language they can understand - risk and value.\u00a0\n\n\nVery simplified example - just saying you need to replace something because it's out of support means fuck all. Aren't you support? Instead, this piece of hardware that is responsible for $x of revenue which we lose if it fails, it costs us $y to maintain but will cost $z to replace. You might still get a no but at least they understand better what they're saying no to.\n\n\nIf you have no one who is doing this, you either become that person or look to leave.

Looking at the common issues, everything from drive fragmentation to extended uptime on shared devices, and trying to figure out how I can get ahead of those issues. I ended up in some places reducing our calls from 1-3 a week to zero just by not accepting \"this is how it is,\" and some of those fixes were functionally no push at all.\n\nAs a good example of that, I noticed that our Operating Rooms (ORs) had their keyboards and mice constantly being accidentally disconnected by the users. After a couple recurrences and being told \"Oh, that always happens, now that we know you're not scared of being in there you'll see all those tickets,\" I realized it was happening because we used PS2 devices and cheap, worn out extension cables that were too short for the maximum range of the keyboard arm. I convinced management to buy USB instead since they have a more positive engagement, longer extension cables, and buy me some extra wraps and zip ties, and in around an hour of work converted all the ORs and never had it recur.\n\nThe proactive mindset matters a lot, and while I know not every tech has it, or wants to deal with it if they do, or is just plagued by shitty metrics designs, at the end of the day it's up to you to start building a new proper dam, not just slapping more mud on the levee.",

Endless break/fix work is a feedback loop - more unplanned work means less planned work done which leads to more breaks.  If users email in urgent issues, just forward the emails to the ticketing system.  Working too much and stressing about it causes burnout and your burnout doesn't get more work done, so don't do it.\n\nA good exercise is to break down your efforts into percentages by goal.  My view of healthy is around 30% break fix, 30% preventative work, 20% new projects, 5% administrative, 10% meetings, 5% communication for an IT organization in crisis.  If you can get out of crisis mode, you should probably dedicate 10% time to training or deliberate practice or networking.  Come up with a percentage breakdown that you think is appropriate and then bring it to your boss.  They may adjust it a little but they'll probably agree to the general idea.  Then you take those percentages and set quotas for the week - 12 hours of break fix, 12 hours of preventative work, 8 hours of new projects, 2 hours of admin work, 4 hours of meetings, 2 hours of emails and phone calls.  Make it into a daily  / weekly schedule and just stick to the hours.  If there are complaints, work with your boss to revise the percentage breakdown or decide together that it already makes sense and the reasons just need to be clarified back up the chain.",
