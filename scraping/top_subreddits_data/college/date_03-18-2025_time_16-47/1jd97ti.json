    "selftext": "I'm not sure about the terms since I'm not from the US, so I hope the context will be clear.\nI'm a BPT (physiotherapy) student in my final semester. One of the requirements is writing a research seminar, and I'm part of a group of 3. One is a good friend, the other is not.\n\nI'm really excited about the topic, and the others are not. This is fine by me, and I don't mind doing the bulk of the work! I like my own flow and the topic is engaging enough for it to be an enriching experience. However, what I didn't expect was doing 100% of it. When writing the research proposal, we divided the work so that they write the little bits that lean on the work that I already did, or just require writing down basic information about the research procedure. As we're nearing the deadline, the two aren't answering my messages, their part isn't done, so I do it for them and miss classes. After the deadline is gone, I write a long text. Friend calls me and apologizes, explains that he's been caught up with taking care of his pregnant wife and it won't happen again. Asshole didn't even answer when messaged him about how this behavior is unacceptable.\n\nFast forward 2 months - we need to send our research protocol, ethics committee form, and the \"informed consent\" form. As usual, I write the research protocol paper by myself, but asked the other two to write the other two forms. I can't describe how simple a job it is. It's basically copy-pasting onto an existing format. It takes maybe half an hour to complete. Again - we approach the deadline. Friend now has a newborn baby, and he's somewhat answering. On the deadline *date* when I ask what the hell is going on, Asshole sends me a form titled \"scientific consent\" (in my language, the two words sound similar). I could feel my blood boiling. I proceed to open the document and I just started laughing. It not only was an entire mess, the dude has no idea what we're doing. Our research is about exercise in VR. Not once did he mention VR in the whole text. \nI wasted my precious time and sent it back with comments, which he didn't reply to. So again, I did it all myself. \n\nI forgot to mention that from the beginning I've been bringing this up with our professor. She basically said \"I hear you, I see you, but find a way to work with your team\". After what happened, I asked to talk with both of them. Friend replied and he got (another) ass kicking, and we talked about planning care for the baby with his wife and family because I can't do this on my own. Asshole didn't respond, not surprisingly.\n\nAfter a day and a half of him repeatedly ignoring me, I sent him this: \"Due to your lack of communication and minimal contribution to the project, I will not be writing your name and you will not be a part of the group. I will not use the materials you sent. Regards.\"\nHe texted me back in less than a minute. We had a short and stupid conversation. I was respectful for most part (except when I said that the \"scientific consent\" was the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen someone write).\n\nLong story short, I've been left with my own devices to deal with both these shits. These are my devices. NOW the professor and someone from management wants to have a meeting with all of us. I'm scared. I hate confrontations, and I fear they'll force me to give him credit for nothing. I want to come prepared, but I also know that when I'm nervous I tend to overprepare and bombard with information. I also don't know how far back to go. Should I just stick with recent events or should I go back to the very beginning of this crap?\nALSO, I didn't address the friend - he's not been acting like a friend. We worked together a lot and he's never been like this. I know the baby is taking a toll, but the alternative feel unbalanced. I don't have a baby, so I don't know. I have a feeling that during this meeting, the Asshole is going to try to bring Friend down with him. \n\nAnyway, I'm feeling stuck and scared. I don't mind doing 90% of the work, but I need that 10% done. I also feel that giving him credit is complying with bullying. I also don't know if I can prove that he didn't help at all writing the \"research proposal\" (I had to rewrite what he sent because it was wrong. It was *not* an issue of neuance, but plain wrong. I don't have a copy of it anymore).",

            "body": "Go back to the very beginning. Please understand, your classmate did no work on the paper, they do not deserve credit. No, they are not going to force you to give your classmate credit. The meeting is probably to find out what the hell happened with the classmate and to make sure that your story is consistent. \n\nKeep your screenshots of conversations. If you did the essay on something like Google docs, you can even bring a PDF of the tracking history on the document to show that no one contributed anything beyond you. If you created the outline, have that on hand. Same with the research protocol. Essentially, you are in the right here. Do not be afraid. If they even try to spin the story or to pin it on you, please do escalate the issue. Why? Academia is already having a problem with authorship and papers when it comes to publication. Do not let them  enable that. \n\nNow, for your friend who was busy taking care of his wife, that is really unfortunate. However, because this is college, and for some people, doing research is their sole job and it's the only way that they make money, radio silence from that friend is not okay. Something really should have been said a lot early on, so that you could prepare for the shifting of the workload, even if it was just temporarily to cover getting the protocol in. The friend that said absolutely nothing? Do not hide that. Do not hide anything. Why? Citations. For a lot of research papers that get published, when there are many authors on the paper but the authors didn't contribute equally or deliberately chose not to contribute equally (essentially they contributed to things that they knew were their strengths), at the end of the paper, they will write down who contributed to what aspect of the research, whether it be the research design, paper writing, editing, data analysis, etc. If the friend who was taking care of his wife contributed later on to the project, not all that great, but he at least did work and you can be honest about that. But once again, do not cover for the person who did not communicate and did not contribute. Just be honest and keep the receipts for your work.",

I would also love to hear how to escalate this if need be.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have all the previous versions of the work. I have conversations about it though. I also don't know if I should bring up first the major events (which are recent and his assholery is most prominent), or describe an escalating process.\n\nFor example, the research proposal was the last thing we attempted to work as a group on. I have messages upon messages in which I'm practically begging for help from both of them to achieve the deadline. I also have a message I sent them about how hurt I feel from that same day. I also have evidence of the work not meeting the basic requirements, and having to call a friend (someone who already graduated) who offered to help me meet the deadline. The thing is, it's walls of text... do I just show it to them or do I make some summary? \n\nI also don't know how to show them that it's an issue of him NOT WORKING AT ALL, and not me being an over-achiever with impossible standards (which is something that the professor suggested, but is not the case).",

                                    "body": "So... The meeting happened and I think my nerves got the best of me.\nThe meeting started with them basically reprimanding all of us for acting like kids. They asked what's up. I said that I've been doing most of the work and kept getting ignored, and that I had to take on a \"leadership\" role when it's not what I wanted. I mistakenly tried to explain that I took a larger role and let them do easier things, but the way I worded it made it sound like I was gatekeeping. I really tried to backtrack but the damage was done. Asshole tried to say that whatever he did wasn't good enough for me, to which I replied that I can show them exactly what he sent and why it was unusable, and that I documented all the instances in which he completely ignored me and left me with all the work. The head lady from management made a face. I couldn't tell if she was annoyed, impressed or pissed. Wasn't a good face. \n\nEither way, the bottom line is that they didn't really care about any of this, they just wanted to solve the problem: do they need to break up the group, or is everyone fine with Asshole leaving. Asshole said he doesn't want to work with us anymore, and Friend and I want to continue working together. Once that was solved nobody cared about anything. The head lady said she'll find a project for Asshole to do alone, and Professor said she wants us to continue the project with her. \n\nSo I got what I wanted. Feels like things got twisted, and the narrative is that I'm an irrational crazy lady that decided to randomly go off on this guy because he \"didn't do my bidding\". The professor and the head lady made a stupid demand that I stop \"leading\" and \"giving orders\" to which I said \"PLEASE!! That would be such a RELIEF\". \n\nThey were also upset with me for not bringing it up sooner. When I said \"I did... More than once\" the professor said \"but you didn't tell me that it wasn't solved!\" (Or something). So I'm very confused - either she's my nanny or she's not. I have no idea what I could have done differently. I think it would be unprofessional to involve her in this more than I did.\n\nSo..... I don't know. I got what I wanted. Maybe I'm naive and expected them to be more on my side, but when push comes to shove - I'm still working on this cool project on a topic I love. I'm with Friend, who tried to help me out when he saw I was tripping over my words by describing how great we work together, that he won't put me in this position again and be more involved.\nHead lady tried to twist it again by implying that maybe I'm upset that since I have more free time I do more, and I'm upset they're not keeping up (Friend and Asshole are also doing their clinical rotations while I have more free time since I completed mine). I didn't even respond to that. I was too mad and trying not to cry. Also, I already got what I wanted.\nHow stupid.",

I take my work extremely seriously, and sometimes it can seem as though I'm overly strict, when in reality it's attention to detail.

I had a professor tell me that people like me, because we see through everything, we'll encounter more conflicts which we need to learn to navigate. We require people to look at faults. I really try to be soft about it, which is probably why Asshole got away with as much as he did. \n\nWhat will come of Asshole: just like he never reviews his own work, he'll never review his own actions. I hope his future patients will only be simple cases, because he has zero ability to research. Unfortunately, he won't fail, because faculty wants everyone to complete their degrees on time. Me kicking him out was massive pain in their ass, because now they need to find a solution for him. Maybe that's why head lady made the unreadable face when I said I have everything documented. \n\nI care too much about what the professor and head lady think about me. I'm mostly confused and don't know how to read the room. Did I create enemies within the faculty? Will this impact my ability to enter a masters program?

Keep emotion out of it in the meeting. Be polite but couch the whole thing in terms of integrity and the facts of what happened. Have the screenshots of conversations ready and organized (not to search through on your phone then) but don\u2019t bring them up until asked about your communication. \nGood luck. This does happen and it\u2019s something we all have to learn to deal with and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing here. You stay flexible to a point and then also stand up firm for yourself honestly. Sharing credit is not the same thing as completing someone else\u2019s work for them. The latter is akin to dishonesty or cheating. And that\u2019s basically what this sounds like.",

Right now I'm gathering conversations between me and both guys, e-mails, anything to create a coherent timeline.  \nI am having a really hard time to organize my thoughts though. Confrontations make me very anxious, and I tend to get lost in what's relevant or not. At the time, when I brought this up to our professor, she suggested that it's an issue with managing my expectations, as in, I expect them to hold some impossible standard and be as involved as I am in the project. Obviously, this is not the case. How do I prove it? I have the most recent \"scientific consent\" which is ridiculous. Other than that, the only time he worked on something was the research proposal, I don't think I have older versions of it. I had to rewrite his portion because it was wrong. Do I need to find proof that what he wrote was unusable?",

Asshole was actually super hyped after our first visit to the lab. \n\nThing is, he's one of those intelligent kids that had it easy enough through high-school, so he never learned how to study. It's \"whatever doesn't succeed at first attempt isn't worth investing in\", and has little ability to deal with topics that require a little bit of unraveling. It made it impossible for him to implement feedback, because he'll never take a minute to review his work. Useless.....",
