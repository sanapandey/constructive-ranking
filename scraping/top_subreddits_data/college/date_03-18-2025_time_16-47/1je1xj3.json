Its our finals and I've missed two weeks of work due to me being hospitalised by pneumonia and even now I'm supposed to still be recovering but I'm trying to attend my last two weeks of classes and catch up on everything but I'm really tired, physically and mentally and emotionally.. I don't want to repeat my subjects. I'm just really trying my best right now but I'm so tired and there's so much to do and so much missed works",

Different institutions do this differently, but you definitely have adequate reason for an incomplete. \n  \nBE CAREFUL with your time once you have the incomplete agreement in place. If you go directly into another full schedule of work or classes, it can be difficult to complete everything necessary to get the incomplete class work done. Schedule yourself time to dedicate to that make-up work along side whatever you\u2019re doing next.",

I explained to my professors what went on and how I could not type (all that\u2019s needed for online school) and they all gave me an incomplete and we created a timeline to get the rest of the work done that aligned with my surgery and doctors orders. An incomplete would be the best option for you and you won\u2019t get any negative marks against you. Good luck and I hope you\u2019re feeling better\u2764\ufe0f",
