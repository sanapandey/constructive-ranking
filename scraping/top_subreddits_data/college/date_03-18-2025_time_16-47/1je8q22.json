    "selftext": "Switching from civil engineering to marketing and wondering if i should withdraw from the classes im currently taking that aren't necessary to take for my new major. \n\nSome info that may lbe useful to know:\ntI've got a B and two D's in the classes I'd be switching out of, (Not 100% about the D grades, those professors don't like putting grades in the gradebook). I've also got a gpa of 2.7 after failing 2 classes last semester. Taking 3 other classes besides the 3 im considering dropping.\n\nI appreciate any and all help I may get from this post.",
