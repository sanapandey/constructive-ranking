    "selftext": "For some context, I didn\u2019t really try in high school lol. I ended up with a 2.47 GPA and got a 19 on the ACT. I\u2019m also currently 23, so I graduated HS in 2020. Never once brought work home from school from middle school and beyond lol. I think I could\u2019ve done much better, I never necessarily struggled with my work, it was more so of a not paying attention, not taking notes, sleeping in class, being stoned out of my found issue. \n\nAs an adult my life has changed a lot, I won\u2019t go to far into it but I had some pretty severe mental health issues as a teenager which led to me do self destructive things. For some reason entering adulthood my outlook on life took a complete 180, especially after moving out of my parent\u2019s house, moving from Wisconsin to Southern California, finding some actual success in life and realizing how good it can feel. \n\nAt the moment I\u2019m a class A truck driver, I actually enjoy doing it too but I think I\u2019m capable of more. I also think that driving all day long and not really working aside people takes a major toll on me, I feel like I never have time for anything and I\u2019m constantly exhausted. I make $28 an hour with just shy of 2 years of experience and my job isn\u2019t over the road, it\u2019s a local gig out of Irwindale, CA making residential building material deliveries around the greater Los Angeles area. On the other hand I have a friend who I went to CDL school with that has an MBA and absolutely hated his job as a project manager and got into trucking. \n\nOne of my biggest concerns with going to school at an older than typical age is being rusty on different subjects, I don\u2019t think I even remember how to do times tables lol and I\u2019m sure you can tell my writing skills could use some improvement. \n\nI\u2019m mostly drawn to getting into forest management. I\u2019d like to maybe get some sort of job working with CalFire, BLM, the USDA, The U.S forest service etc\u2026The idea of being a park ranger sounds pretty cool as well or even a forest management consultant with a logging company. \n\nAnyone have any insight? Living in California I know the state has a lot of great aid/programs that really help out with the financial aspect of education. ",

There\u2019s a lot of non traditional students, and most professors understand that students might be rusty, and the school offers supports for it.

If you get an associate\u2019s at a California cc, you get automatic admission to at least one CSU, and you can do TAG which is a list requirements you have to meet and if you do, you get guaranteed admission to a UC.",

            "body": "Disclaimer, I'm a 22 year old college senior who graduated in 2021 and went straight to college, pursuing a degree in Natural Resources.\n\nI think forestry/enr/wfb are all great degrees for \"nontraditional\" students. I've had at least one 25+ year old student in every class each year. Nobody treats anybody weird for being older in the natural sciences, at least in my experience. Look for the Land Grant universities in your area; they like students of all kinds and often have some of the better natural science programs while being affordable.\n\nI will also say that the salary for foresters/managers is highly variable and trends lower than you would think. I have 3 years of experience from several research opportunities and relevant jobs, and I am struggling to find entry-level jobs that pay $20 an hour. Lots want you to have a Master's degree if you want to hit at least $60k a year. Something I wish I'd done was take more GIS classes and pick one singular internship, and stick with it for all of college to have a much bigger pay bump once I graduate. I do love my degree, though, and it's definitely worth it for me as I'm graduating debt-free.\n\nThings are kind of dicey right now for this type of career path because lots of funding is based on federal grants, which are up in the air right now. Since you are based out of California, you will probably be okay because you have the national parks and (unfortunately) wildfires that will keep foresters employed. You are also going to be finishing school after the next presidential term by then, so the monetary situation may improve, but also maybe not. Just something else to consider.\n\nAlso, your truck driving license will probably be a huge benefit to any sort of forestry/logging company because it shows you can get special licenses and safely operate different vehicles. Makes you a great candidate for grunt field work internships lol",

I started at community college but this fall I'm transferring to a college I never could've got into with my high school GPA. (Mental health, awful home situation, etc) \n\nGo to community college. Do the best you can in your classes but don't beat yourself up if you struggle. Work with your academic advisor to make sure you take the right courses. Take advantage of any free resources at the school and don't feel bad about it! \n\nI'm a tutor now at the community college I'm in. An issue we get with a lot of students, especially nontraditional, is that they're embarrassed to ask for help. It always helped to tell my notraditional students that I'm in the same boat as them. And something crazy you might not know, tutors get tutored too! If were struggling with something we'll walk over to our coworkers to get help. I've done it a couple times myself, both for my own homework and when confused while tutoring someone else. Asking for help isn't something dumb people do, it's what smart people do. If you ask for help, we can help you. But if you show up at the end of the semester and you expect us to help you cause you're failing your class, our hands are tied. We want to help. I LOVE to help people. This is my favorite job I've ever had. So don't feel bad and don't be scared. We want to help you. I promise!",

            "body": "Sharing my experience in the hopes it helps you consider a few things... I am a HS drop out, had a job making a decent wage but not fulfilling and limited growth opportunities.  I started classes at a community college at the age of 27 before transferring to a university.  I considered fisheries & wildlife science, but after researching the job prospects and expected wages I decided to study engineering instead.  \n\nOne thing I regret is not taking more classes at the community college.  The classroom and lab facilities were outstanding, the instructors were amazing, the classes were smaller, and I was surrounded by a diverse group of students (16 year old high school students for college credit all the way to 60+ for fun) who were all committed to their education.  I never felt out of place.  The transfer to university was a shocker - all the money is spent on flashy dorms and athletic facilities.  The classrooms haven't been updated since the 80's.  And I was surrounded by 18 and 19 year olds who were just there to party every weekend.  I'm sure each community college/ tech school vs. university varies greatly, but that was my experience, and the cost per credit at the community college was much more affordable.  \n\nI highly recommend doing research on job prospects and wages before committing to a program.  I used o*net and bureau of labor statistics to look into different degrees and career paths.  If you are feeling unfulfilled, by all means think about a change.  But be aware/ educate yourself on what to expect.  You could try volunteering at local parks for outdoor programming to start to make some contacts in that community and see if it's something you are still drawn to.  Also recommend engaging with extracurricular clubs/ organizations through the college or university, and internships.  \n\nI am a big advocate for trade school, too.  I have seen first hand the shortage of good construction operators, laborers, electricians, plumbers, HVAC techs, etc.  And those guys make $$$.",

Most of these can be done on average one a month and represent 30 credits out of an AA of 60.\n\nThat is 9 courses.

The USDA (and thus USFS, USFWS, NPS, etc\u2026) have been targeted by DOGE and are struggling really hard right now. People are getting fired, and those that remain now work in understaffed systems that make doing the right thing very difficult. Environmental jobs are always at the whim of the administration, but the current one is really fucking things up. Who knows if we\u2019ll have a very different admin in four years or not, but it\u2019s something to think about. Also, federal jobs don\u2019t pay well, neither do state. If you\u2019re wanting to go to college, get your degree, and get paid, you\u2019re looking at the wrong degree. The private sector (timber farming, consulting) is a little better, but it\u2019s no powerhouse.",
