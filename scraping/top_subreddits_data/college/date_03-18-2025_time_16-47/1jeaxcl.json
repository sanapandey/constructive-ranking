    "selftext": "I've been working on my undergrad thesis for a little over a year now and have been rather pleased with our progress and results. It's a very exploratory topic in computational musicology\u2014we started by building around a few random ideas we thought would be interesting and seeing where it goes from there. It was our group's first time doing any sort of research, so we didn't realize then how large of a scope this kind of study could balloon to. We often joke that some parts could easily have been its own thesis.\n\nOf course, we did quite a lot of research to establish as solid a foundation as possible, but apparently it wasn't enough. Over the past few months, I've come to realize that the main part of our methodology has serious room for improvement\u2014partly because I've stumbled across better studies and implementations, and partly because, now that I have a clearer view of the bigger picture, I can see how lacking, incorrect, or discordant it actually is.\n\nI'm still proud of our work and progress. My group mates, adviser, and panelists also think highly of the thesis. But part of me suspects that's because they haven't dived as deeply into the literature as I have, so they might not notice the flaws that are now glaringly obvious to me.\n\nOn the bright side, I see a better and clearer direction for our thesis. However, we're graduating in a few months, and I feel bad and demoralized knowing how many holes and issues it actually has. I want to start from scratch, but I know that's completely unrealistic.\n\nhoping for some advice, thanks :)",

The point of an undergrad thesis is more to teach you how to conduct and write about research than it is to actually contribute to a field. That\u2019s more what grad school is for.",
