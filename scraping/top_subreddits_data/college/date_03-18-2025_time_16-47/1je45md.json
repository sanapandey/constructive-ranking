This way you get to the subject of roommates first. If you already started the conversation I would simply ask if they've found a roommate yet. I found my roommate back in January, and I actually found them by looking through my universities incoming freshman hashtag. I told them that's how I found their post and asked them if they were looking for a roommate.",
