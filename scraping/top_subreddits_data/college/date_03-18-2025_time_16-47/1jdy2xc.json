    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in school since September 2020 and only have 75 credits as of the end of this semester (semester ends April). \n\nI failed so many courses in my first and second year and honestly didn\u2019t think much of it then, but now it\u2019s come to bite me back. Honestly, I\u2019ve never been a good student but after recovering from depression, I wanted to change myself for the better, especially in terms of school. Though with this change, I\u2019ve been finding myself so stressed with my homework and I keep overthinking things. Yeah, I still procrastinate, but I still try to do my work. The problem is it just feels like there\u2019s so much going on. I\u2019ve broken down on several occasions over this. Even when I finish my work on time, I still feel stressed.\n\nI won\u2019t be slated to graduate until either Fall 2026 or Spring 2027, and just thinking about how long I\u2019m taking in school and how much longer I\u2019m going to be in school for just stresses me out even more. To graduate in the timeframe I mentioned I need to take course loads of either 2/4/4/2/4 or 2/4/4/3/1 (the 2\u2019s being summer semester). It sucks even more thinking that I\u2019m losing out on my summer to meet the graduation date I\u2019m hoping for. There  are a couple underlying reasons on why I need to graduate by then, which I don\u2019t particularly want to divulge.\n\nI know the reason that I\u2019m in this situation is my own fault, but I just feel so stressed and always on the verge of breaking down these days. I just don\u2019t know what to do. Honestly I don\u2019t even know what kind of replies I\u2019m looking for either.\n\nTLDR; I\u2019m super stressed about how long I\u2019ve been in school/how long it\u2019s taking to graduate for and how much work it is.

Honestly my best advice is to stay busy and PLAN AHEAD I\u2019m talking months in advance to cope with worrying. If there are classes you can take at community college take them over the summer. Do part time work be involved in your department. I feel the same way but one you plan everything you know you are working for the long term. Keep your head up.",

(As I have worried when doing simple things, somehow it blew up in my face.) Worry will eat at you untill there's nothing left. Instead you shouldn't worry but cast your cares on Him who cares for you. He will hold all of your worry, your hate/anger, your lust, and your big problems. \nIf you let Him hold everything, since He created everything, He will make you succeed.",
