I feel like I only take two classes because I\u2019m just not used to the work load that the average high school or college student is used to while also working. I tried doing two classes while working almost full time while on a rotating schedule and I literally had a panic attack and dropped my classes last semester. Now I\u2019m doing school during the week and working on the weekends. I always feel guilty that I\u2019m not doing enough. Everyone else around me is one of those people who works full time and does school full time and I have no idea how they do that.",

            "body": "Tl;Dr - Yes, work at a pace that works for you, but please do reflect on your goals and situation to figure out if you need more support from your school\n\n\n\nHonestly, right off the bat, my questions are what exactly is your goal and what is your situation? \n\nThe reason why I asked is because it's going to tailor the response to the question of if you're doing enough. \n\nYes, everybody is right that you really should be taking classes according to the pace that you can handle. Burnout is a very real risk and it can turn your two classes a semester to zero classes permanently. Additionally, taking more than you can handle, especially if you're working, can turn your two classes with good grades a semester to more than two classes with subpar and maybe failing grades or a lot of withdrawals that need to be redone. On the other hand, depending on what your goals are and what your situation is, maybe you need to be having a conversation with someone at your school. \n\n Now, you can absolutely provide me with information like what your degree is, how long are semesters are, how many credits are required for your degree, what your goals are, etc. However, for the sake of discussion, let's just use an example to illustrate why I'm saying that those two questions matter and that may depend on if you're entirely good to go or if you need to be having a conversation with somebody at your school. \n\nOkay, say that your goal is to become a clinical social worker and you are in the United States. To become a clinical social worker, you need a bachelor's degree and you need a master's in social work. On average this will take you 4 years for your bachelor's degree, I'll even go as far as a 5 years because recent studies have shown that it's actually taking people now on average 5 years to complete their bachelor's degree, and 3 years to complete your master's degree. So, 8 years in total from beginning to end of your college stay. Now, at the school that I go to, students are told that when completing their bachelors, to stay on the path of being able to finish their bachelor's degree in 4 years, they need to be taking 15 credits for each of the 16-week semesters. A class for a relevant bachelor's degree to become a clinical social worker is going to be three credits And we can assume that the bachelor's degree is 120 credits in total based on the map of 15 credits per semester with two semesters per year and you complete the degree in 4 years. Though I will say, that there were definitely degrees that took more than 120 credits to complete. Say that a student decides to go part-time for completing this bachelor's degree. So they're taking maybe on average seven credits for each of the semesters instead of 15 credits to graduate in 4 years. By taking seven credits a semester, they will complete their bachelor's degree in roughly 8 to 9 years, more likely it being 9 years. Mind you, I just said that if we go with the average of 5 years to complete a bachelor's degree and 3 years complete a master's degree is a total of 8 years to become a clinical social worker, by dropping down to part-time for just the bachelor's degree, at my school, a part-time student would take the same amount of time to complete their bachelor's degree as an average student would take to complete their bachelor's and master's degree. This does not take into account that the workload of graduate school classes is much heavier than classes for a bachelor's degree. \n\nNow, why those two questions I mentioned mattered. Personally, I would love it if anybody and everybody went to college, whether it be for the sheer love of learning, to get training for a specific job, for a combination of the two, whatever. However, depending on what your goal is and what your situation is, your choices in college can be limited. So for instance, say you're just going because you love to learn or the degree that you're getting is out of passion, then everyone here is absolutely right that you do not need to worry at all about comparing yourself to other people because you are working through your classes at the pace that works best for you and you do not have anything pressing that would cause you to act otherwise. On the other hand, say that you're racking up a lot of student loans or having to pay a lot more because you're part time or you're attending college to get trained for a specific job that you hope to start soon, you may have a bit of cause for concern because, like my example, going part-time can significantly lengthen how long it might take you to complete your degree and if you're on a deadline, whether it's self-imposed or society imposed, you're in a sticky situation. \n\nNow, if you do happen to be in a sticky situation, for whatever reason, I would suggest talking to your school about it to see if you can get accommodations or talk to somebody about your issues. I remember when I first came on Reddit, one of the first posts that I got to read through was about a lot of homeschooled students talking about going to college and whether they stuck it out or ended up dropping out. One thing that a lot of students didn't take advantage of was seeing if their schools were willing to work with them considering that they may not have been prepared or felt comfortable with dealing with an increased workload compared to what they had been dealing with. Some schools are willing to assign you a note taker to help with classes. Some schools are willing to essentially extend semesters for students so you would have more time to complete all of your work. Some schools are willing to alot you extra time when you're completing exams or quizzes. Some schools have advisors that are willing to work with students to tailor their degree plan to see what is the fewest number of classes they need to complete to achieve all of their degree requirements (so classes that might double or triple dip for requirements). In the case of mental health stuff like anxiety, some schools have therapists that are willing to work with you in the long term to help you with that. In the case of students who are working and going to school or  are just having to go to school part-time for a situation that is outside of their control, some schools may have programs that are specifically designed for those who are working that may either have fewer credits or the classes are cheaper or the classes are more flexible.  \n\nUltimately, I want to reiterate, that right off the bat, everybody commenting that going to pace that you can manage are absolutely right. You do not want to risk burnout. You do not want to risk subpar class performance. However, the ultimate answer to your question, comparing yourself to others aside, can only be answered by you as it depends on your situation, your goals, how your school works, what your school has to offer, etc. Call it projecting if you want, but I bring up this line of thinking simply because I have had too many friends who had everything between horrible family/living situations and serious undiagnosed disabilities or mental illnesses and horrible professors/departments/degree programs that caused them to sometimes restart their degrees multiple times or double or triple the length of time it should have taken them to complete their degrees and it tore them up and traumatized some of them.",

Talk to your academic advisor to map out how long it would take on this plan or that plan or the other plan.  \n\nI only knew one person who worked Full-Time and went to school Full-Time over the last 10 years.  She was incredibly driven, incredibly supported (married), and stable in her life that she could sacrifice her social life to reach her goals faster.  Last I heard she was a regional manager for a large chain of liquor stores.  Everyone else I know had to balance work and school.\n\nPersonally, I found I had 60 or 70 hours in my week that I could split up between work and school. Each class, generally, was worth 10 hours of time per week. Basically, if I was working full time (40 hours) I could thrive with 2 classes and burn energy reserves with 3. \n\nI had some semesters I took 4 or 5 classes, but I dropped my work schedule accordingly.  4 classes, 20 or 30 hours of work.  5 classes, 20 hours of work. \n\nYou might also be able to find you can balance more classes in later semesters as are more confident in your skills.  You might have a few Gen-Eds that you can walk through because all you need to get a B or an A is show up and use the basic skills you have from Eng 101 to produce a couple essays.  And a scary 4 page essay today will be no sweat after a while.  \n\nYou also might be able to do a bit more as you are more situated in your field.  At the end of my degree, I had taken so many field specific classes that they overlapped and built on each other. I had less to learn each class compared to anyone who two less classes under their belt. \n\nLastly, my last semester I **WAS** able to work FT and school FT because I worked with my department to have an internship at my job.  So, I took my normal 2 classes and full time job also counted as 2 classes.  I'm not saying this works for everyone just that you might be able to finagle something.",
