    "selftext": "I have seen a lot of advice on other subreddits and the wider web that it is ill advised to store personal stuff on your work laptop, and vice versa.\n\nI was wondering where the implications of university managed accounts (i.e. Microsoft office, adobe suite, etc.) come into play, and why it is more acceptable for university \"stuff\" to be stored on the same PC where porn and gaming occurs.\n\nAlso, what typically are the implications of using these licensed products bought by the uni to create content for recreational/commerical use outside of the uni course work (i.e. photoshop)? In the work force context, my understanding is that it is commonly thought as being highly inappropriate to use work resources for personal gain.",

(Also, many of those laptops have software where IT can access it at any time, so you don\u2019t want personal stuff on there anyway).\n\nI don\u2019t know of unis that are giving away laptops that you have to then return (like a work laptop). If you are borrowing a laptop from the uni, no, I wouldn\u2019t use it for personal stuff either because you have no idea who can access it.\n\nIf you have a personal laptop, then do what you want on it. Work, school, personal things. \n\nAs for software, you can\u2019t really have multiple copies of it \u201cpaid for\u201d for personal or work reasons. This is just understood, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of anyone getting into trouble using a software for personal gain, because that\u2019s just how computers work.",

It\u2019s not the commercial software you use that\u2019s an issue with work Computers and email. It\u2019s that your employer has access to it and there is no expectation that anything on there is private. This is completely different than a school computer you own. \n\nthough you should never use your school email for personal things you want private. The school can access that anytime.",

Whereas a job is paying you to do work for them during time that belongs to them\n\nAlso, if you drop out of uni you don't lose your laptop or the work you've already done. If you quit/get fired, they take back any devices they gave you, and you could get in trouble for keeping work that belongs to them",

Your work owns the entire laptop, so they can check anything on that laptop. \n\n2. You own any work you produce using the school's resources. If you create a short story using a school-owned Microsoft account, the school doesn't have rights to your short story. If you create something on a work computer, your company may have rights to it. \n\n3. General different attitudes. Theoretically, college is all about personal gain (I realize this isn't always the case in practice). Plus allowing you access to these things can be a recruitment strategy. Your job just needs you to do your job. Some jobs to try to advertise themselves as being personally fulfilling, but this isn't an expectation the way it is for college.",
