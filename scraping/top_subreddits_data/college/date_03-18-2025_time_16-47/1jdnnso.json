I\u2019m enrolled in 5 classes for the Spring Semester: Computer Science II, Discrete Math II, Ethics, Java Programming, and Composition I. However, I spiraled into not doing any work for Java and Comp. My grades for the other 3 classes are good, but my current grades for the other 2 classes are 0s. \n\nIs there anything I can do to get back on the right track?",
