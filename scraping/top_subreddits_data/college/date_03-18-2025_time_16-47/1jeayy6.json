I have access to a masters robe but know the sleeves are different, but if those were pinned up would it be possible to pass that off for the usual bachelors gown?\n\nTIA\n\nedit for clarity: both robes are full black",

At my school, Master's gowns are *not* different from Bachelor's gowns *whatsoever*, you receive the exact same one as a Bachelor's graduate (and it's free to borrow, you don't buy the gown), there is no difference in the sleeve or anything. It's the *stole* at my school that differs a Master's graduate from a Bachelor's graduate.\n\nIf your school actually has different gowns for different levels, then *how* different they are and whether one can pass as the other is a question for graduates of your school who have worn/seen that gown in action, as we can only use our own schools as points of reference.",

I didn\u2019t wanna buy two gowns so I did the pinning the sleeves thing on the masters gown for the bachelors ceremony, ngl it did look a little weird and different than a normal bachelors gown, which I was personally ok with it bc I knew I had also earned a masters and didn\u2019t really care. If you\u2019re ok with that then go for it, but if it looking indistinguishable from a bachelors gown is important to you then no I wouldn\u2019t recommend this tbh",
