    "selftext": "Pretty much the title.  My kid received offers from schools to play sports which is great.  But the tuition is 32k a year.  We (parents) cannot afford that so there would be student loans. \n\nLocal CC said they will give full ride with some leftover.  I know CC is inexpensive.  But free is free. \n\nThe CC has a soccer team and a transfer program for the degree he is looking for. \n\nI believe no debt and a good education is the best play here. But am I wrong for not sending him to play at a real college?  \n\nEdit: \nFor more info. We can afford to pay about half.  He would have to cover the rest somehow. If it was all loans there wouldn\u2019t be a question he\u2019d be going to CC\n\nD3 only does academic scholarships.   \n\nIt\u2019s more of a \u201che put in the work to get here regardless of whether or not he can go pro thing\u201d.  So it\u2019s more of a has anyone done this? Or what would you do? ",

And assume there's no post-college soccer career, because the odds are there won't be. Would you pay a hundred grand to play soccer for four years? If not... *don't do exactly that*.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: What I wrote above doesn't even take into account that I would be reluctant to pay 32k a year *period*. Big state schools offer an excellent education and in-state tuition is usually half to a third of that. Going a hundred+ grand into debt for an *undergrad degree* is *nuts* (unless you're at a flat-out Ivy, and even then I'd think about it very, very carefully).",

I will never advocate for anyone to go hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt for an undergrad degree, but I am a firm believer that college can be a formative and really unique time in someone's life, and if they truly have this passion for their sport, this is the only time they will ever be able to compete at this level.

Usually CCs have course codes that are \"universal\" to large public universities in the state. At this point all public universities have their major degree paths available online. It's just a matter of finding that and checking off the applicable courses. *Transfer acceptance rates are typically far higher than first year acceptance rates at universities*. Scholarships are different, and transfer students have their own niche of grants and funding available at large public universities. For example, Arizona CC transfer students who grew up in the state get their tuition fully covered at ASU, NAU, and UofA. Transferring is not hard, you do have to set a path for yourself and stick to it. It does involve learning the bureaucracy of academia, which is a valuable skill to cultivate for life. Thankfully with the advent of Google, that can be done from your couch.",

I now work as a design engineer at a large company, and am having some modest but consistent career success. At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure if college was right for me (1st gen grad and all that). And I can say now that I was not ready for engineering school coming out of high school. So what college sports did for me was A) put my ass in that seat in the \u201con ramp\u201d for my professional degree and B) kept me grounded as a part of a team and all the social/mental health benefits that go along with that. I didn\u2019t have any financial support from family for school (I\u2019m a full award pell grant recipient, but that\u2019s another topic), so I am paying handsomely every month for the decision to go into debt for college sports, but, being honest with myself, I\u2019m not convinced I would\u2019ve made it without sports. I don\u2019t know if your kid is similar to me in that way, but their maturity and academic readiness are other things to really consider. Sports keep you in school, and that\u2019s a really underpitched part of D2/D3 recruiting spiels you\u2019ve probably sat through. Feel free to DM if you want to chat, hope this helps!\n\nEdit: reading this back makes it sound like I was too stupid for college and needed my hand held. Partially true, but for the record I was a good student, and wound up being very good at engineering. I just don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been ready to dive in at 18.

Please check out, class for class, what the next school accepts in your son\u2019s major. You probably will end up paying for at least 1 extra semester in the next school, and graduating in more than 4 years. Transferring takes serious dedication.  Also, the team will not be competitive.\n\nCommunity college is a great steppingstone for academics. Community college sports give athletes time to get ready for bigger opportunities.  It surely saves lots of money for students who would have to pay 4 years of tuition. \n\nIt sounds like your son is ready for a University. Why make him wait?  Not everyone gets scholarships and can go to college for 32K. Congratulations.",
