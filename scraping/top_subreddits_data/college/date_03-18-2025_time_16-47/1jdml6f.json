    "selftext": "it has been 2 sems and i\u2019ve been dealing with this guy ever since sem 1. He always scream and laugh uncontrollably loud, and vapes all the time. The worst part is, he does it all the time, even bedtime. Hygiene wise, he barely takes a shower even if going to class and when he does, he won\u2019t hang his wet towel and leaving it smelling bad. \n\nAs a quite hygienic guy that don\u2019t smoke and prefers silence, it has been a real challenge to live with this guy. I tried asking the warden to change room a lot of times but he won\u2019t listen. I\u2019ve been trying my best to avoid this dude by breaking in an empty room but got caught a couple times already. I had no choice but to deal with this guy.",

I get how hard it can be when you\u2019re trying to live in a space that\u2019s just not working for you. maybe talking to your RA or getting advice from them might help too? and if he\u2019s really violating rules, there could be some action taken.\n\nif you\u2019re feeling stuck, you could always try getting an air purifier or a fan to help with the smell a bit. i know it\u2019s not a fix for the situation, but it might help ease things a little while you figure out what to do next. hope it gets better soon",
