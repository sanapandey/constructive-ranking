    "selftext": "Hi, from some time ago I've been thinking about this idea.\n\nThere is a clear division in my college between passing the tests and learning for real.\n\nIt's easier to explain with an example, most of my lectures are based on books but are focus on you passing the final test. So if you try and study through that book you can get more information but it doesn't help you pass the test. \n\nIn my college they focus too much on the exam more than on teaching. That leads to questions on the exams that look like: \"Remember what we study on the point 1 of the second page of the teachers notes? Based on that select the correct answer.\" \n\nSo I find myself skipping classes and going to the main study lounge to study through textbooks, I know more than some of my classmates about our classes but I also know that I'm less prepare to pass the exams. \n\nI don't like that I'm being punished because I try to expand my knowledge.\n\n",

            "body": "i struggle with this so bad--often overstudying because i dont like having the lingering questions of why something is the way it is but then not being prepared for the test because theres not enough time to learn comprehensively and memorize the need to know material.\ni guess how ive come to terms with it is understanding that learning is a lifelong thing and if i dont grasp everything in one semester of a course when im also taking three to four other classes its not the end of the world if i still have questions (this will always be the case lol cant change that). i know its not as satisfying to study to pass the exam, and maybe it feels a little fraudulent or fake to you, but also professors will assess understanding in different ways and unfortunately you just kinda have to adapt how you study if you want to both learn and pass.",
