How many credits would you recommend I take? I don\u2019t know how these work. I am not really looking for accreditation in my home country, I just wanna get some experience. Thanks! ",

            "body": "It depends on both you and the university. My school has a spring/summer session that is broken up into three terms: the spring term (6 weeks), the summer term (6 weeks), and the spring/summer term (12 weeks). Courses offered during the spring/summer term are almost offered as long as they would be during the usual 15 week fall or winter terms, but a bit shorter as they're only 12 weeks. Courses offered during the spring and summer 6 week terms are very condensed.\n\nStudents can only take a maximum of 15 credits in the *entire* spring/summer term, but if a student chose to do all 15 credits in the 6 week spring term, that would be fine...but you wouldn't want to take a full 15 credit semester in only 6 weeks, would you? So, with that in mind, consider first how many credits you are *allowed* to take during the 4 week summer term at your school.\n\nSecondly, think about how many credits you think you are *capable* of doing. Many students struggle to do a full course load in a standard 15 credit term, so 4 weeks would be *extremely* condensed and you would likely have a *lot* of work to do in a very short time. You haven't started college yet, you're finishing up high school, so you can't use your previous college classes as reference for how well you might be able to handle it, so I might recommend just doing one or two classes *maximum* just to see whether you can even *handle* two. One class in only 4 weeks is already a lot.",
