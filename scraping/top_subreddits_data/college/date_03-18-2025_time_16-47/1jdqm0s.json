    "selftext": "\nHey, I\u2019m Ivy, a college student, and I just wanted to share something I\u2019ve realized\u2014I actually like being alone. For some context\u2014 in high school, I thought that when I got to college I would would be partying, drinking, and making tons of friends, and finally finding out what sex feels likez but now that I\u2019m here, I\u2019ve been severely disappointed. Drinking isn\u2019t great, parties are crowded and overwhelming ( I felt like I was going to die at the last one I went to), and even sex just feels... meh.  \n\nFriendships have been easier than in high school, but I still often feel out of place in group settings. One time, my roommate\u2019s friend (T) and I had an awkward moment in line at Qdoba, where I felt shut out of a conversation ( They started laughing for no reason and I didn't get what was so funny). Another time, when I tried to engage with those same friends about doing their makeup for Halloween, they seemed uninterested. It\u2019s little things like that that make me feel disconnected.  \n\nI do have some friends I vibe with, like (V), who introduced me to her friends, but they\u2019re still *her* friends, not mine. Plus, whenever I try making plans, people flake last minute, and it\u2019s frustrating always being the one putting in the effort. At this point, I\u2019m kind of over it.  \n\nI\u2019ve realized I genuinely enjoy spending time alone\u2014probably 75-80% of the time. Please God I hope I don't sound like a snob becausei really do like people, but maybe I just haven't found the right group yet. \n\nThanks.",

Parties are generally overrated as well, and it takes time to make good friendships. Don\u2019t worry too much about it, as long as you\u2019re happy with yourself that\u2019s what matters. Also, I feel like college can be such an overwhelming place socially. I used to really enjoy going out and constantly being with people, but it also makes you realize how nice it is to have privacy.",

I definitely don\u2019t want to have to be physically around these people if it can be avoided lol I\u2019ll take my grass touching in solace without the yammering background of human presence please. I used to be mostly social but I\u2019ve been holed up in my room for a few years now and it\u2019s just better imo. Be yourself and enjoy your time alive the way you want to.
