    "selftext": "So my professor told me my lab practical was going to be rescheduled (due to him not attending the first meeting), and to look out for an announcement for a new time and date on which it would be held. It\u2019s been two weeks since he said that to me, no announcement yet. Now, I look at my grades and there\u2019s an automatic zero for the lab practical, bringing my grade from an A down to an F. I realize this is probably a placeholder grade, and that hopefully it will still get rescheduled and I\u2019ll be able to take my test, but I emailed him two days ago telling him I was concerned and wanted to confirm that I wasn\u2019t actually receiving a zero and he still has not emailed me back, or made any announcement about the test. To make things worse, this is an online course so I can\u2019t ask any classmates if they\u2019re in the same boat. Should I email or talk to someone above him? I feel very anxious at this point :/ I worry about my grades a lot. ",
