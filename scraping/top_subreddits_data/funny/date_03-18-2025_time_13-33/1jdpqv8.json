I took it because I had no credit, but after 6 months I refinanced at the normal at the time 1.5%, and cut my payment down 1/3. Dealers are betting on people not knowing this. I openly wanted the extended warranty, so they sold it to me for $2500 with a $100 deductible, I found out later I could have bought the full warranty online for $1000. Only used it once in 100K, on a Chrysler product.",
