Dawg..\n\nI felt how hard they cut my gum. I heard and felt the drill go into my tooth. The crunchy cracking sounds. The ***smell*** too.. wasn\u2019t sure if it was just like dirtiness that they uncovered or if that\u2019s what the inside of my teeth smelled like, but it was a new and unforgettable smell.\n\nI remember the amount of force this guys hand was applying to my head to stabilize it as he cracked and pried and pulled at the tooth with his other hand. I remember being scared that any one of those movements would miss and hit a part of my mouth that wasn\u2019t numb. \n\nLuckily I felt no pain at all. Just a bunch of jostling around and pressure and stinky smell. That shit ached for WEEKS though :(. I couldn\u2019t fully open my mouth even two weeks after the extraction. My mom and sister had gotten wisdom teeth removed and they were fine after like a day and were making fun of me calling me soft.\n\nI got another non-impacted one removed after few months after that and that took like 1 minute. Barely needed a Tylenol the next day and after that, I felt completely normal.\n\nIf I need to remove my other impacted one, I\u2019ll go the same route though. I\u2019d rather be conscious and a bit uncomfortable than risk waking up mid surgery or whatever else can happen while under. No judgement for those who do though. Just sharing my tale",

Then came the hammer... JEEZ! I would never forget how my entire skull shook as they chipped off parts of my wisdom teeth... After that, they stitched it back together... and did the other side. \n\nProcedure finished about 5-10 minutes before the local started wearing off. And then, my world got rocked by the gravity of pain that was literally crushing my head. \n\nAll in all, it wasn't that bad.

I've been putting it off because going through that several more times, or even having multiple done at once is just nightmare fuel for me.\n\nTake care of your teeth kids.

I got mine taken out in Navy boot-camp, and for some reason, the Navy hates giving anyone anything that could help relieve pain. All I got was a touch of novocaine from a cotton swab on my gums, then an old-as-Methuselah asshole dentist took a pair of pliers and steadied his knee against the chair, and began pulling and wrenching my wisdom teeth out. \n\nAll of them....With a pair of godd\\*\\*n pliers.\n\nAs I was walking back to my barracks in the snow, I was trailing so much blood that a passing RDC took me to the base hospital. They didn't want to deal with me, so they turned me around and sent me back to the dentist office, where a younger dental officer, put me back in the chair, and spent an hour sewing up my gums, (with just a touch of novocaine, no less),  On top of that, they told my RDC's I was supposed to have LLD (Light Limited Duty) bed-rest for a day, since I had lost so much blood, but of course, all 3 of them ignored that, which led me to having to continue to suffer while continuing on with training. \n\nWhenever I see someone on YT being recorded getting their teeth out and laughing their asses off while getting sedation, it makes me want to punch them.  \n\nNot a very good visceral reaction, I know.

For example, people with hypermobility (like me) may require more sedation. \n\nAs an aside, I used to do a lot of ketamine many moons ago and I would try extremely hard to k-hole. It just wouldn't work. I would always be able to walk, talk, and wouldn't hallucinate at all. Meanwhile, the people I was with would be on another fucking planet talking about being a spade stuck in the mud on Neptune or something.\n\nBenzos like diazepam don't do much for me, either. They make me tired and kill my motivation, but I don't feel any \"high\" from them. They can work for panic attacks but don't exactly get rid of all my anxiety like they do for some.",

The Dr had to call me immediately with the biopsy results the next day since I had more info than I should have. Also, was made to promise I wouldn't sign any contracts for 48 hours.",

The doctors/nurses came in and told me to stay seated and that I'd need to be taken out to the car in a wheelchair and that I'd probably feel loopy for a while afterwards.\n\nBut from the moment I woke up I just felt normal. Had no problem getting out of the wheelchair into the car and held a normal conversation with my dad on the way home. I didn't think too much of it, but then videos of people post-surgery started becoming popular online with people having weird conversations and reactions and I started to wonder if maybe everything seeming normal had just been in my head? So I asked my dad and he said I was as normal as ever when I woke up and was surprised because he was expecting to have to take care of me for a couple hours but I just went about my day like nothing happened.\n\nIronically the ease with which I came out of it and hearing stories about people who were conscious but paralyzed during surgery put a bit of a fear into me. As a bigger person (not many people bigger than me) I worry that my unusual size will throw off whatever anesthesias and doses they usually use, because apparently it was unusual with how lucid I was and it makes me wonder if I was that close to coming out of anesthesia during the procedure.",

I never went under, so I could feel each blow of the hammer.  Didn't hurt, but good thing my head was firmly backstopped by the headrest. It was scary, though, seeing the hammer come down, blow by blow.\n\nThis was at the VA hospital in Houston back around 1975/early '76.  Funny, though, I never questioned why the dentist I went to see for a checkup sent me to the VA.  Maybe he assumed I had no insurance, but I was already working at Gulf Oil as a geophysical technologist, so I must have had insurance.   Ehh, I was just a kid, barely out of the Navy!

Basically half my brain/body shuts down. The symptoms are remarkably stroke-like which my wife does NOT love.

Those are my external symptoms. Internally (in my consciousness) I am completely fine. I just can't communicate my thoughts verbally. This is A. Fucking terrifying, as I feel trapped in my own body, and B. Annoying because I can generally text just fine. It just takes a while because of the aforementioned reading issues.\u00a0\n\n\nThe brain and speech patterns are very weird.

She realised that she fucked up and was like \"oh sorry, I didn't mean to offend you!\" and I was like, it's not because of whatever my opinion is, it's because you're saying it loudly in a medical centre and we have no idea who might be listening and what situation they're in, and part of compassionate patient care means not accidentally shit talking people who might have to have a procedure you don't agree with!\n\nAnyway I shared that because of the amount of times me and another colleague have gossiped behind the desk about the company and totally forgot that its patients are sitting right fucking there.",

As he counted down from 10, James knocked out, had his surgery. The anesthesiologist waited for him to almost recover before resuming the count down.

We took her to the vet and it turned out her heart was failing her. The neighbor told my gf that she was around 8, but the vet said she was around 13-15. \n\nShe went to sleep in my lap and it was the hardest thing I've ever done. She was such a sweet and chill cat and had a permanent grumpy face. I have an 8 year old cat myself and I'm terrified of the day I lose her. \n\nPets are wild man, we can just develop friendships with certain animals?

It\u2019s \u201ctalking\u201d if you will, that\u2019s how it makes everything function. Anesthesia offsets those signals so your brain can\u2019t talk to itself anymore. You\u2019re alive, your brain is still functioning, it\u2019s just a little useless. Once the anesthesia is taken away the signals sync up and you\u2019re a bit confused and groggy but totally normal again. Until they found this method they were basically having to knock the brain out with ether or other intense drugs that caused it harm. Anesthesia is pretty damn cool tbh.",

As that sent me into a panic the time before that. \nThe second anesthesiologist came over and started asking me the intro questions again and the nurse said the other one already did that and he said look none of it is filled out it wasn't even done half-ass. Then when I was on the table the other doctor said they have only oxygen as he was pushing the IV. He said he would ease me down..\n\nI have been under many times but the last time I went under it felt very long and drawn out, like my consciousness was slowly drowning. It was absolutely traumatic and the single scariest experience I've ever had. The extreme fear felt like it was easily the most intense  and slowest 60 seconds of my life.\n\nI've almost died many times before and nothing was that scary. The oxygen mask wasn't sitting right and I was desperately trying to get it to sit on my face. I remember it vividly and exclaiming that this doesn't feel right and I don't like it at all, and asking for help in fear.\n\n It felt like the milk drop visualization in winamp where all the colors and images of my perception were slowly melting and dropping down into a pool on a flat surface. \n\nWhen I came to, I heard the anesthesiologist say to the other doctor \"I know 30 lorazepam and 60mcg fentanyl seems heavy handed but he chased it all the way down\"\nWhen I woke up my O2 wouldn't go above 70 for a while and it felt like my lungs refused to expand long after I was conscious. I was asking the doctors in the recovery room if this was normal as none of this has happened to me before and I'm scared.\n\nAll this for a colonoscopy.\n\nIt was absolutely terrifying. I cried several nights after and was afraid to fall asleep. I felt depersonalization and like my consciousness was liquid and I was slowly piecing myself back together over a course of hours. Nothing was making sense and my thoughts came so slowly even when I got home. \n\nAbsolutely horrible.",

I worked summers in a local hospital in the OR doing transports and cleaning after surgeries were completed in the afternoon.  I always said the anesthesiologists had an easy job as long as everything was routine. I'd probably say the same thing today.  It looked like they followed a cookbook.  Get patient on table. Hook up the EKG and BP cuff. Get IV started (if one had not already been started).  IV sedation. Intubate, hook up to gas, etc. etc.  The same thing with each patient with a few changes once in  a while.  After surgery started, they kinda of sat back and watched the monitors. Made sure your BP and HR and EKG were OK.    Near the end of the surgery, they started on waking you up.  All the same time after time.    They were sort of off in their own land at the patient's head.\n\nUNTIL-- It wasn't routine.  Until some emergency surgery came up rolling in. Until someone wasn't an average patient. Until someone needed blood transfusions. Until the surgeon found something unexpected or had to change plans part way through.  Then that anesthesiologist's job got really complicated. He/she suddenly wasn't following some cookbook for beginners.  They looked like they were doing 10 things at the same time to keep you alive.   They were doing multiple things at the same time. To keep you alive.",

Not what you want when you have a breathing tube in. Obviously in an emergency you can't wait around for the food to go through.\n\nIANAD, this is just speculation from an armchair not-doctor.",

Same when we\u2019re waking you up, as the tube is coming out.\u00a0That\u2019s why fasting is required for elective cases with anesthesia involvement.\u00a0\n\nFor emergency surgeries, we still do general anesthesia with the tube - it\u2019s basically a requirement for anything requiring opening of the chest, belly, skull, and a number of other cases. We just accept that there\u2019s a huge aspiration risk, but the issues associated with aspiration/aspiration pneumonia are less than the issues (potential death, permanent disability) of not going through with the surgery. Plus, there\u2019s a cuff around the outside of the tube that prevents solid stuff from getting into the lungs, though it won\u2019t fully prevent liquids.\u00a0",

The tugging is weird, because the brain does not know what this feeling is, its not meant to feel that and its confused and causes the weirdest sensations from deep within your body.

I can feel the pain, but the sedation makes it so I don't really care.\n\nFor something that will actually put you in a fair amount of pain, they'd definitely up the dosage to something more like deep sedation.

I remember being on the operating table and the next conscious thought I was sitting up talking to a Nurse. She asked me if I remember talking to the doctor, I said no. So, she got the doctor on the phone and I talked to him. He asked a lot of simple questions, if I knew where I was, if I knew why I was there.  He Talked about the recovery and so on. But this just disappeared once the call ended. I know the questions but didn't remember the answers.",

I had gotten a tooth removed after days of pain.  Back then I used to just accept toothaches until they went away on their own (somehow that worked; they usually weren't super terrible).  But a few years back, one of them was like really bad.  To the point that I think the tooth exploded in half.  So, anyway, I was barely getting sleep because of college + work already, but add tooth pain on top.  So I gave up and went to the dentist.  Wisdom tooth, and it was half exploded, so you know it a bad one.  \n\nThey removed it, which was nice to begin with.  But then they gave me hydrocodone. Took one, went to sleep, and when I woke up, I was not groggy whatsoever.  No sores in my muscles.  No pain in my back. I was like \"wow, is this what normal people do every day?!\"\n\nSecond night, I was like \"wooo hydrocodone time, I want to enjoy this sleep again!\"  Well, fell asleep, but it wasn't as life changing.  Still a decent sleep. \n\nThird night I reached for the pills and immediately was like \"nope, not getting addicted.  I'm enjoying this too much.  Back to my insomnia.\"  And that's how I avoided becoming a druggy.  I still crave it sometimes, but I'm glad I'm not hooked.",

Pain is a dynamic response, and left untreated, it can grow, independant of your conscious awareness.\n\nSo in addition to propofol, you will generally be given an opioid, and a local anaesthetic, to deal with pain during the intra, and peri-operative period. Even though you're not consciously aware of the pain that's being inflicted on your body, the pain is treated while you're under the effect of propofol/sevoflurane/etc, to minimize the \"residual\" pain you experience when you wake.

I guess I scared a poor 89 yr old who was in the post op room. I feel bad about that, but also I literally didn't know or had enough time to process what was happening.\n\nIf I went to sleep under anesthesia, I may have woken up screaming, but only cause I had no pain meds in me.

But if the teeth are impacted or have any other complexities that'll make it harder to remove them, sedation is just easier. \n\nIt's also really not the same as general anesthesia (where you can't even breath on your own).

Max Feinstein (a board certified anesthesiologist with a fantastic YouTube channel) has an entire video dedicated towards anesthesia dreams and how some people don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real, while others claim there\u2019s evidence for it being a thing. Give it a watch if you\u2019re interested, it\u2019s a pretty short video if I remember correctly but he gives his thoughts on the phenomenon.\n\nWhat\u2019s definitely true though is that anesthesia is NOT equivalent to sleep. You can directly measure brain wave activity on EEG - a brain under anesthesia is indeed kinda\u2026dead. Not literally dead but as dead as you can be while being alive. Sleep in contrast has clear and well-known brain wave cycles that define the stages of sleep (N1, N2, N3, and REM). It\u2019s rhythmic and you can easily tell the brain is still doing stuff, just not as actively. REM sleep is when dreams occur most vividly and frequently, which is interesting, because this is the stage where your brain waves look almost indistinguishable from being *awake.*\n\nIt\u2019s extremely odd that dreaming is *apparently* possible under anesthesia when - as you said - in theory it shouldn\u2019t be, if true dreams are most common when your sleeping brain\u2019s activity is as close to being awake as possible. But there\u2019s enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that it might be a real thing anyway. Just goes to show how little we know about our own brains, even after so much research and progress.",

My last one went into one of those crazy bright surgical suites and wake up in a dark room many hours later, seemingly minutes went by.

She couldn\u2019t give me any more without risking my safety so the doc gave me the choice to either continue without anesthesia or reschedule. I knew rescheduling wouldn\u2019t make a difference and so I went ahead.

Well, we need more of pain and anesthesic drugs because the mutation that causes our red hair is also responsible for making us resistant to medications.\n\nI've been under numerous times, but there were two botched instances in which I went to have steroid injections into the SI joint and I woke covered in iodine and very confused. When I asked the nurse in recovery what happened she got this funny look on her face and said, \"well um.. you jumped off the table and took a swing at the doctor\" \n\nI laughed, a very nervous laugh. \"That's.. uh. Really freaky, um.. has that ever happened before?\" \n\n\"No. Never. And I've worked in this hospital for 30 years.\"\n\nloooool\n\nRound two, I told them for their safety they could wrap my arms in koban to the table arms so I didn't hurt anyone. They did so. Annnnd I ripped out of them and assaulted the staff again.\n\nThey discharged me as a patient after that. \ud83e\udd23\n\nAfter that I have learned to tell my anaesthesialogists that I might be prone to leaping off the table.",

                            "body": "When you receive an induction dose of anaesthesia, you typically stop breathing and it\u2019s the job of an anaesthetist / anesthesiologist to take over your breathing when this happens. \n\nThis happens in multiple ways but it\u2019s typically one of \n- using a tight-fitting face mask +/- an oral / nasal airway adjunct and pushing air in (we call that mask ventilation)\n- using a supraglottix device (an ear-shaped plastic device - it\u2019s the bright orange item on the anaesthetic machine on OP\u2019a video), which is placed at the throat right against the larynx (the opening of your windpipe)\n- inserting an endotracheal tube - a tube that goes into your windpipe by using a device to lift the tongue out of the way. \n\nNow, we are very good at all three and it\u2019s not a drama most of the time. One way or another, we will always be able to take over your breathing and keep you alive. \n\nEvery once in a blue moon, for whatever reason, one or more of the above can be problematic. As long as at least one method works, we willl still be able to keep you breathing. But if ALL three fail, then you are in the so-called CICO (can\u2019t intubate can\u2019t oxygenate) situation. If we don\u2019t solve it within minutes, you suffer brain injury or brain death. \n\nNow, when a normal person stop breathing the atmospheric air, they typically drop their oxygen level below 90% (the threshold we normally consider \u201cbad\u201d) within 1 minute or so, after all the leftover oxygen store in your lungs are exhausted. To give ourselves buffer, the standard anaesthetic practice include preoxyvenation, ie you get the patient to breathe 100% oxygen to fill up the lungs with oxygen. Doing so would allow the oxygen level to stay above 90% by up to 5 to 10 minute when without any breathing - and that gives us a lot more buffer when it comes to the CICO situation. \n\nThe practitioner in this video is in flagrant violation of this universal safety step. Most of the time they will be fine and they will still manage to take over the patient\u2019s breathing uneventfully, but the one time they run into CICO, their lack of preoxygenation is absolutely indefensible in modern anaesthetic practice. \n\nIf you want a chilling story of CICO, check out Elaine Bromiley\u2019s story - a young woman who died from this and is now a standard cautionary tale for all anaesthetists. \n\nhttps://vimeo.com/103516601",

They are going to compete and hold their breath underwater. One of the twins \u201cA\u201d does it without preoxygenation and \u201cB\u201d does it with oxygen. It\u2019s important to note that both would have a very pulse oximetry reading (let\u2019s just say both are at 100%) because they are young and healthy. The difference is the percent of O2 left in the lungs after the start holding their breath.\n\nTwin A would be able to hold his breath between 20-45 seconds before desaturation started while twin B (with O2 before starting to hold his breath) would be able to hold his breath for minutes (usually 2 min) before desaturation started on the same curve. \n\nNow imagine this same scenario for intubation. A person getting Oxygen prior to induction/intubation has a much longer timeframe before danger starts to happen. That is the essential concept here. It is always safer to give Oxygen prior to anesthesia. This is why it is standard of care for anyone receiving anesthesia. It is outside of the standard of care to induce someone without oxygen supplementation. Because it is outside the standard of care there ought to be a very compelling reason to not do it. Social media posts are not a compelling reason. The most obvious example of not being able to give oxygen prior to anesthesia is a severely autistic pt.",

But I would have still expected that they give you at least some oxygen through the nose . But for nasal/oral surgeries involving general anesthesia you still give preoxygenation before going to sleep. You can move the tube out of the way to one side of the mouth once it's in.\n\nAs far as wisdom teeth maybe it's like the wild West out there. But personally if I knew that I wouldn't receive any oxygen while getting propofol I'd probably go somewhere else. We still use some kind of oxygen for all sedations like for colonoscopies. I've never heard of, nor seen, any anesthetic being done without any supplemental oxygen.",

Reasonably healthy patients can be apneic (not breathing) for about 8 minutes and still have plenty of oxygen in their blood as long as they've had about 3-5 minutes to breathe pure oxygen prior to the start of anesthesia. We don't let patients stay apneic and will breathe for them with a ventilator. The worry here is that this patient was not getting extra oxygen before the anesthesia, meaning she wasn't optimized for the start of anesthesia. Hope that helps!",

They took two wisdom teeth out of my head and I couldn't even tell you when it happened. Normally with extractions under local anesthesia, you still feel pressure that lets you know when the tooth is coming out.\n\nDidn't have any of that for this. I think I literally asked them at one point if they had taken any teeth out yet xD Also my extraction was kinda complicated as it involved some bone grafts to areas that they were removing.\n\nEdit: I was on an IV the whole time. To people who are medically trained, that probably provides some insight. For me, all I know is that I was on the happy juice and couldn't feel the bad things.",

Local anesthetic is just going numb you up, it shouldn't cause impacts to your mental faculties. I've worked on patients who are under conscious sedation and even from a professional standpoint, it's weird. They just lay there calmly while the doctor literally has access to your main blood vessels for stent insertion. The main one I really remember, we were able to ask the person some questions, like how is your pain, or say \"we're going to do xyz\" and they could clearly understand but couldn't really respond. I was a student in a teaching hospital at the time and the we had a student doctor doing the procedure while the watching doctor watched through the glass in the main console room. Anyways the doctor did a count for when bleeding should be stopping, and the patient didn't stop bleeding to the young doctor's shock. The experienced doctor comes over the intercom and say, \"what medications is this patient on?\" The answer was blood thinners. Once the young doctor figured that out, everything finished up smoothly, but you could tell the doctor was beginning to panic because things didn't go according to textbook. The patient just laid there with 0 concern about the fact that they couldn't stop the bleeding.",

That this is why it's not like \"sleep\" or anything, and why it completely blanks any memory, because your nerves simply aren't firing in order for you to make memories. \n\nThere was something else about it not actually blocking pain receptors or anything like that, it's just that your brain is so shut down it doesn't receive the pain signals, or if it does, you have no awareness when you wake up because it wasn't capable of making the memories.",

I kept telling them not to bother as I was going to lose the leg soon anyway. This is a huge study so I was losing my mind in front of literally 6 top doctors, one of which flew in that morning for this study. (There were multiple patients). Then each doctor had a student/resident at least. They were overflowing into the hall. Then a good majority of them followed up in the coming days and each one told me of something else I said in that time. Imagine racing against anesthesia for something like that!

They told me I may get a taste of garlic in my mouth, they started the injection, sure enough garlic and out cold. Think it was 2 seconds from starting the injection to being out. I know they have different types for different surgery and I suspect this is one that is not as strong.  Not sure what they use for colonoscopy but that one was fast too.\n\nI did have a weird experience in my teens for my tonsils. They apparently gave me some opioids before wheeling me in. They said I would be pretty loopy. Nope, didn't feel anything at all. The doctor walks by and says I thought I told you to give him X. Nurse says I gave him what you instructed. Turns out I don't really get high or whatever off of opioids for whatever reason, even though the pain killing does still work. But I didn't learn this till later in life with subsequent surgeries where they gave me more. Kills pain, makes me feel sort of unpleasant, but nothing resembling a high. Looking into this it turns out there are a fair number of people out there like this, not the majority but a significant percentage. Something in our genetics where opioids don't get us high or something. I would make a terrible heroin addict apparently.",

The surgery was for my nose and face. My nose was broken and couldn\u2019t be reset because the bone around my nasal cavity was also broken from a bad car crash.\n\n\nThe day of the surgery finally arrives and pre-op me was totally nervous. I felt like I had to pee so many times. I kept trying to stall. Doctors do their prep talk, nurses do their work and all reassure me it\u2019ll be fine and routine. \n\n\nCount down from 99 as they wheel me in to the operating room. I see the lamps, carts, and then the tools laid out to either side where I\u2019m very soon going to be. Then I think \u201cthis is all for me!\u201d I feel a rush of heat as my vision fades. Last thing I hear from the dark is a nurse saying \u201che\u2019s elevating!\u201d\n\n\nWhen I woke up I was so confused because what to everyone else was a few hours, to me was days if not weeks. I was so out of it and was so deep I felt robbed. I even got angry about it for a while. It wasn\u2019t until a day or two at home that I felt like people weren\u2019t lying to me.

A sweet old lady came and gave me a fig newton and juice and told me I slept the longest she\u2019s over seen a patient sleep. Ig I was super tired prior to the anesthesia because I was out for like 25-30 min post camera insertion or Wtvr you want to call it, I forget the name of the procedure. It was such an odd experience and a little jarring, knowing that theirs drugs out there that can produce that effect.

That was always... fun.\u00a0 My epidural didn't work for me but I'm pretty sure other factors were involved in that cluster fuck.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFor my second labor they seemed to be watching my contractions better and the nurse was feeling some sort of way about my pain tolerance/threshold.\u00a0 I'm pretty sure she's the one who made sure I didn't feel anything when it came time to push.\u00a0 I didn't feel a fucking thing, I had to go through the motions and hope I was doing it right.\n\n\nI was blessed a few year ago, too.\u00a0 My dad got a windfall inheritance from his auntie and took care of my rotting teeth and my wisdom teeth.\u00a0 *(I should have got it done in 2001 and fuck that dentist.\u00a0 My mama knew I'd be off their insurance so she wanted my wisdom teeth out but they wouldn't do it.\u00a0 Instead I had headaches and jaw pain for another 20 years.\u00a0 They never cut through they just grew further into my molars for decades)*\n\n\nThe lady that did my front teeth was amazing and it was all under local anesthetic.\u00a0 I didn't want to be put under for anything because I wanted to keep costs as low as possible.\n\n\nBut when it came to the wisdom teeth I had another guy doing it.\u00a0 I insisted they just numb me up.\u00a0 He faught me even before I came in.\u00a0 I'm like, 'NOPE! I've done all of this and more.\u00a0 I'm good.\u00a0 I stay still, I won't even wince, twitch, or show pain.\u00a0 Even if it hurts I'm a trooper.\u00a0 Just get it done.\u00a0 You're not charging me another $1200 to put me under.\n\n\nBless this man's heart but he couldn't even begin to grind or dig before he tossed his tools down and said he couldn't do it.\u00a0 Good for you dude! Have your sensibilities but I'm NOT paying!\u00a0 Bring it or don't.\u00a0 I can reschedule.\n\n\nI didn't pay for anesthesia but I had them put me under listening to Rainbow by Kesha.\u00a0 It's my brother's and my song and it was my happy song.\u00a0 We were both going through breakups/divorce and we love that woman so I figured that'd make the deep sleep nice.\n\n\nMaybe it's because I'm older.\u00a0 Maybe it's because my surgeon was worried.\u00a0 Maybe it's something with my physiology now but it was the first time I was completely OUT for the whole experience.\n\n\nAll I know is I woke up and he and the assistant were looking at me reeeeeal weird. \ud83d\ude32\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude33\u00a0 I don't know what I was saying but I wish they would have told me.\n\n\nBased on their faces I'm glad my Pops wasn't there to hear it at least.",

I first got a cocktail of pills and then an injection, and jokingly said that I\u2019d try to fight it. Doctor laughs, \u201csure buddy\u201d. Has me count to ten, I do that, I\u2019m hanging out normally and then he goes \u201cwell it\u2019s time to start\u201d. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean time to start doc? I\u2019m fully awake!\u201d \n-\u201cno you\u2019re not, we have to because of the timeframe, you\u2019ll sleep off in no time\u201d \n\u201cBut I\u2019m awake!!\u201d \n\nAnyways, he tells me to go on my side and breathe deeply. I felt like a sword went thru me, I started screaming lmao. My dad, in full OR attire, got lightheaded from my screams and blood. I remember hanging on to the sheets with my life, clenching my teeth, groaning. I remember getting stitched up. I remember them helping me get to a sitted position on the operating table. And when I was being transported to the wheelchair, I faded. Woke up in my house, felt the whole thing lol.",
