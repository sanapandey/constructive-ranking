I think of it like two guys in a bar watching the same bullshit on the news, while on very different drugs\n\nLeary is the guy wired on cocaine and alcohol.  So he's pissed about everything and screaming. And it could be funny to watch him do that. But rage is hard to sustain, and get directed at the wrong things for no reason.\n\nHicks is the guy on weed and psychedelics.  He's figuring out the patterns he sees and wants everyone else to see it too.  He's fun to listen to, and you hope he keeps on talking because hes making sense.\n\n \nSo yeah, at a glance people are going to support Hicks, who died, and be angry at anyone too similar as a pretender.\nI get it.  \n  \n I watched Bill Hicks Revelations special when it debuted on HBO.  I watched Learys  No Cure for cancer when it debuted on Showtime. I liked them both. At the end of the day the clear difference between them comes down to style and delivery.  \n\nHicks's jokes were like a Snake, steadily coiling around the audience until it bit them with the punch line. Hicks was more subtle, his energy more smooth and charasmatic, though clear outrage was deep in his foundations. He wanted folks to think about his jokes after they heard them.\n\nLeary in No Cure for Cancer was like a Hyena. Fierce, bold, sudden and unrelenting.  He was pissed. And the way he shared that anger was funny.\nBut he couldn't maintain that through his career. It's why Learys second special Lock and Load was a complete failure. Leary had lost his anger and his edge, married life and kids tamed him. It wasn't funny material.  \n\nI'm sure I'll get down voted for not immediately shitting all over Leary. But this is how I saw it, and still see it.",
