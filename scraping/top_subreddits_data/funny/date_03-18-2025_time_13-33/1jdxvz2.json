Once when I was a youth I saw a female ML about 300 yards off in an opening below my tree stand. I was out walking the trails to my hunting paddock and heard this noise, lots of commotion and crashing. \n\nThe cat was running up the back slope of the paddock and rolling down the slope like a human child rolling in leaves down the hill. I watched for a few minutes and then very very slowly walked back home. Luckily I think between the cats preoccupation with her fun and my relatively stealthy feet, I got away clean but..\n\nThat feeling of realization, that at any second this thing over there looks up enough and sees me, there wasn't a chance in hell my little .22lr was going to deter that murder machine from making me an early morning snack.",
