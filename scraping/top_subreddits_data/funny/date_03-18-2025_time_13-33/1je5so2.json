The summit of the hill is 305 metres (1,001 ft) above sea level. The hill is notable primarily for its unusually long name, which is of M\u0101ori origin; it is often shortened to **Taumata** for brevity. It has gained a measure of fame as it is the longest place name found in any English-speaking country, and possibly the longest place name in the world, according to *World Atlas*. The name of the hill (with 85 characters) has been listed in the *Guinness World Records* as the longest place name. Other versions of the name, including longer ones, are also sometimes used.\n\n* Lead excerpted from [Taumatawhakatangi\u00adhangakoauauotamatea\u00adturipukakapikimaunga\u00adhoronukupokaiwhen\u00aduakitanatahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taumatawhakatangi%C2%ADhangakoauauotamatea%C2%ADturipukakapikimaunga%C2%ADhoronukupokaiwhen%C2%ADuakitanatahu) at the English Wikipedia",
