Maybe like 7 of us knew the song enough to get some yelly mic time.\n\nCome to think of it, this was just after that record (Do or Die) came out. I think I mail ordered it because the record store downtown didn't have it yet. Fuckin' A, good times. Was a 90's punkrock kid, not into the skinhead thing.
