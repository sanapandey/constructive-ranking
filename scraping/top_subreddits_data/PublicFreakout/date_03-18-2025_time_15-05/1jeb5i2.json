My dad and brother were firefighters and whenever they got called to a car fire on the highway, they'd cordon off the area and just drench the surrounding area while it finished burning itself out - it was usually almost done by the time they got there, car fires burn very hot and quick. Gas cars need space in case they pop off, electric cars need to be drenched for hours to keep them cool, and both can be handled from a distance.\n\nSpeaking as someone who's worked for a dealership, what neighboring property? Almost every dealership is a sales floor/showroom with a couple offices and maybe an attached garage, surrounded by a wrap-around parking lot. With maybe a dozen employees between sales and repair, as well as a very open floor plan, there's little chance of anyone being trapped inside. Once they've confirmed that, there's no reason for them to enter the building and risk their lives once it's fully involved. They'll stay outside and drench it to keep it under control while it burns itself out, and since most dealerships are surrounded by wide areas of pavement, there's little chance of it spreading.\n\nIn terms of structure fires, a car dealership is a lot safer for everyone involved than say, an apartment building. No fire is safe, obviously, but it's kind of the least worst scenario.",

You're at best, a collaborator.\n\n>I'm not a nazi\n\nMany Nazi collaborators said the same thing. \n\n>if you think I'm one because I bought an EV to replace my hybrid because I care about the environment \n\nSo EVs to begin with ain't great for the environment. Tesla makes a great deal of money selling its carbon off-sets essentially meaning whatever you think you did for the environment was virtually meaningless. Second off, you have all that mining of rare earth metals and the damage that does. You were stupid to begin with to think you were doing something for the environment. Lastly, I don't think you even own a Tesla, and even you do, you didn't buy it because you gave a shit about the environment. You're here defending a nazi whining about a fucking luxury car. Its far more likely you just love nazis and can't find a way to directly defend Musk so you have to find some other avenue of attack. Its pathetic, and would only work on someone dumber than you are. Thankfully so few people are that fucking stupid while still being able to operate a device that most everyone reading this will see through your bullshit DARVO tactics. Moron. \n\n>People who do this aren't hurting elon, they're hurting the cause. And hurting people on their side.\n\nNot remotely. Stuff like this is lower Telsa sales. Its working. You're using shitty 4chan fascist DARVO tactics to find an oblique avenue of attack to defend your nazi moron untermensch billionaire scumbag ally.",

I believe the rate they would have had to sell them was like 30 per hour. This was days after the rebates went through which pocketed Elon $30mm. \n\nNow shortly after a huge dealership in a major city goes up in flames. Undoubtedly netting the company and thar dealership a huge profit. They will get MSRP for each of those vehicles that they can't seem to sell much right now. Plus it furthers the violence from the left narrative.\n\nI hate that I can't just enjoy an awesome act of rebellion without this lingering doubt.
