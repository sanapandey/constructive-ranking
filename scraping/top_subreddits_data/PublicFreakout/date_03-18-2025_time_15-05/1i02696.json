    "selftext": "#We\u2019re supporting r/LosAngeles in raising money for GoFundMe.org\u2019s Wildfire Relief Fund. \n\nThe Los Angeles community is featured here often, and we believe that they deserve to go back to freaking out like normal without stress from these fires as soon as possible. For that to happen, we\u2019d love to offer them any kind of assistance we can. Note: this is not charity for the rich, the funds will be distributed to the proven needy only. \n\nThe Los Angeles wildfires have devastated homes, livelihoods, and the sense of security many depend on. Recovery is more than rebuilding structures, it\u2019s about restoring hope and stability for families who have lost everything. **The Wildfire Relief Fund provides direct support for fire recovery efforts, helping survivors heal and rebuild with resilience.**\n\n#How Your Donation Helps\n\nDonations support verified charitable needs, including cash grants, small business aid, community relief projects, and vetted nonprofits involved in wildfire recovery.\n\nr/LosAngeles has partnered with GoFundMe.org to ensure every dollar we raise goes directly to verified relief efforts, helping individuals, businesses, charities, and communities recover and rebuild. Funds are sent by GoFundMe.org as recipients qualify, and they continue granting for months after the crisis to ensure affected communities aren\u2019t forgotten.\n\n#We are proud to stand with the following communities in support of the people of Los Angeles:\n\nr/Chargers, r/OrangeCounty, r/EAGLEROCK, r/SouthPasadena, r/NortheastLA, r/Fauxmoi, r/Brooklyn, r/Unexpected, r/therewasanattempt, r/Windows, r/Windows10, r/Windows11, r/WindowsHelp, r/Frog, r/Dinner, r/FatSquirrelHate, r/morbidreality, and r/crazyfuckingvideos\n\n#How You Can Help\n\nDonate: Every contribution, big or small, directly supports wildfire survivors.\n\nShare: Spread the word about this fundraiser to amplify its impact.\n\nTogether, we can rebuild lives and restore hope for the people of Los Angeles. Thank you for your generosity.\n\nDonate [here.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/RedditLosAngeles)",
