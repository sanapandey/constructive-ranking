There are people on the left who haven't touched a gun in their lives and don't want to. But yes, I agree. It's all political theatre, everyone on the left knows it... Kent State happened and there was no armed rebellion.\n\nediting to add: Everyone on the left knows it's bullshit because those laws were written when a bunch of farmers and foot soldiers with normal rifles and firearms could roll up and beat one of the strongest powers in the world (UK). The distribution of power for firearms was more... democratic/evenly distributed back then. In 1776, there were no fucking airplanes. No bombs. No napalm. No nukes. No railguns. No tanks. Today, an armed coalition of basically infantry would get absolutely smoked by the US military. It's all bullshit. I guarantee you, to suppress a citizen uprising/civil war, the military would make Vietnam look like child's play.",

Until then we have the rule of law and the courts, but SCOTUS is a wildcard and whether trump will even abide by any rulings against him is still to be seen. This could very well be the end of the USA as we know it and we could be moving to more of a Putin style oligarchy/dictatorship. If that happens, look to the West and NY with other blue Northeastern states, and possibly Illinois as the last bastions of American democracy, at least for a little while until they all fall or somehow trump and MAGA fall.",
