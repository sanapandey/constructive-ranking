He didn't understand how he might be perceived by others, and felt really entitled. He was pretty awkward but didn't realize it. One day a customer came in and he was trying to help them, but somewhere the conversation got heated and they were both yelling insults. The customer called my coworker gay and my coworker did not handled it well and was shaking, tearful, and still saying insults as he walked away.\n\nSome people really don't know how to handle intense situations.",
