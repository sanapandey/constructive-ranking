It divided their nation so much they cannot join together and stand up to what has happened.\nMany protested and became prisoners. Many left when they had the opportunity. We are beginning to see this here. The question is, do we stand up and make a change... Or do move somewhere and just watch it burn from a distance.. till it lands in our new front yard.\n\n\nThe real issue? The ones that are attempting to divide us. Most people have similar wants, and at our core most people can be good.. But bit by bit the control of the mind takes hold. They have poisoned the populace.. Media can longer be ruled by money, it can no longer be ruled by a board looking to gain more clicks. Our media needs to be decentralized and validated. Those who consistently prove factual will stand out.",

And I do know that in post-war Japan, the US saw an opportunity to greatly expand their sphere of influence in Asia, and that influence and partnership undoubtedly shifts attitudes even further. So the children that were brought up in post-war Japan grew up in a very different environment than the men who fought the war.\n\nDefeating Russia in Ukraine however, is unlikely to shift attitudes there. It would place Ukraine squarely in the Western sphere of influence, but no one is going to move onto invading Russia. Russia is a self-defeating state.",
