The Pharisees bullshitted some trumped up charges against Jesus, and had him brought before Pilate, who multiple times tried to let Jesus go. When he realized he couldn\u2019t free Jesus, he gave him the punishment that befit the \u201ccrimes\u201d: death by crucifixion. \n\nWhy is Pilate a villain? Because he *could have chosen to ignore the law*. Because *just this once*, the law should have been waived. Because it affects them, it\u2019s different; it should be *treated different*! \n\nIt really opened my teenaged eyes to christian, conservative, and christian conservative hypocrisy towards the law. The law was not a force that should be used against them; it\u2019s supposed to be used against those *not like them*.",
