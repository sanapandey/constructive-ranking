Sadly, the talking point was so pervasive that it's become a common myth now, even amongst people who are otherwise probably quite in favor of environmentalism.\n\nThe idea was that all the mining and whatnot that goes into building an EV outweighs the carbon footprint of burning gas in a friendlier-to-build gas vehicle.\n\nBut we've done the math a million times and it's simply not true. Yes, EVs have a higher environmental cost to build. But no, that initial cost doesn't outweigh the massively-higher lifetime cost of burning gas to go places. Even on a power grid like in the US, where we're still burning a lot of natural gas and coal.\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1303-august-14-2023-cradle-grave-electric-vehicles-have-fewer](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1303-august-14-2023-cradle-grave-electric-vehicles-have-fewer)",

I know there were several reasons as to why, but it really makes me wonder what type of world we would live in now, if we went another direction or had hydrogen and electric as competitors. The transition we are in now probably would have been achievable and completed long ago. But to answer your question, i like it and I think we should be working on it more.",

And one (the more cheaper) does not cover vandalism. I think in the US its comparable to only have Collision Coverage and no Comprehensive Coverage.  \n  \nSo the owner might indeed lose out. Also even if the insurance pays, you might not actually get the full value. And there is a lot of hustle to get the money from the insurance and find and buy a new car. The person might be stuck in that city now, and all kinds of other issues.  \nYour argument that the owner lose nothing is completly wrong.   \nDo you personally own a car?\n\nAnd yes a person might be in the car while its being vandlised, might get hurt, might also have a child in the car with them.  \nYes comparing it to a home is very valid. Vandalizing a persons cars is a serious infraction of private property and security. Im not from the US but maybe it would be even legal for the owner of a car to respond with lethal force if someone attacked their car like that, while the owner is in the car.  \n  \nIm not defending Tesla, Im defending the owner of a car, would be the same for any other car brand or any type of property which a person owns.  \n  \nAlso I think the monetary value doesnt even matter.  \nIf Tim Cook was suddenly identified as a fascist would it be ok to grab random peoples phone from their hands and smash it to pieces?\n\nAnd there is one more aspect: You think this hurts Elon, and yes maybe thats even true.  But in fact you hurt the owner, who has no association with Elons politcal agenda, and also you hurt all the people working for Tesla who are also not neccessarly have association with Elons politcal agenda.  \nSo actually I change my previous statement, I indeed also defend Tesla.  \nI dont defend Elon though.\n\nThe best way for you personally judge this, is if you would be ok to randomly get your personal property destroyed for no apparent reason. Its basically the same as getting robbed on the street.",

As long as musk is in charge of the company Tesla (and all his other companies) MUST dissapear, and that will inevitably result in them losing their jobs.
