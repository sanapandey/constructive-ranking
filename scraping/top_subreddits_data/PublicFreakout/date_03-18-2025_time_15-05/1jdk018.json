Where is the responsibility to be moral and ethical, or truthful, for the leadership!? How is the separation of powers an actual debate now!? The actual words being spoken and subsequent action only prove that there is no comparison between Trump and any other rightfully elected leader of our nation. I believe with all my heart that they actually stole the election this time. And everything happening is a form of personal inhumane revenge by someone who knew they were legally convicted otherwise. \n\nWhy do you think they hired the tech guys to DOGE who claimed to have found out how to breach the vote machines the last election? Suddenly they hold government positions. \n\nI was educated to use common sense when given no sincere remedy to my questions. And it\u2019s telling me that the people were sold out.",

It was a world war for a reason. \n\nAnyone with the logic of 1 country won the war has the same bad view as hers. People should actually take some time to look over the whole overview of both world wars. Plenty of resources on YouTube. \n\nTake for example the aerial bombing of Germany and the Russian campaign. Both the Americans and the British relentlessly bombed Germany. Without that Russian ground forces would have not been able to push as much and without Russia taking the brunt of the attack to the Germans the bombings wouldn\u2019t be as effective and would have drawn out the war much longer. \n\nYes, the American landed in France and pushed into Germany.

The book details how France provided essential military, naval, financial, and diplomatic support, highlighting key figures like King Louis XVI, the Comte de Vergennes, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Schachtman emphasizes that without French intervention\u2014particularly through the decisive naval victory at Yorktown\u2014the American colonies may not have won their freedom.

It was done because fur was one of the most lucrative trades in business for the British. On top of that many of the Native American tribes cited with the British during the revolution so the British would\u2019ve more than likely kept that business arrangement for decades to come.",

Prior to the revolution there was the French Indian war, which many native Americans aligned with the British, the proclamation of 1763 that limited westward expansion again was because the Native Americans were responsible for one of the most lucrative export at the time which was fur. So it wasn\u2019t benevolence it was business. During the revolution, the native Americans sided with the British. If the British would have won, it would\u2019ve further strengthen that relationship. So likely proclamation would\u2019ve stayed in place for decades longer. The expansion would\u2019ve been drastically slowed, and there would\u2019ve been British forces there in large quantity to make sure parliaments laws were followed, and there wasn\u2019t another uprising. \n\nI am not saying that it eventually wouldn\u2019t have went south but if that happened at a 50 year slower pace because the British forces would busy keeping the colonies under control and there would be no American forces or army to go slaughter the Native Americans. That would be a drastic difference for Native Americans because they learned a lot in that period of time, would\u2019ve been a lot more time to regroup forge stronger alliances amongst all of the tribes, and with continued heavy trade, they would be far better armed, as trading for guns was common.",

Jefferson brought slaves from Monticello to the White House. The United States took 100 extra years to end slavery and half the country was fine dying to keep it. I implore you to look into those states history with slavery from 1776 - 1865. \n\nI\u2019ve no illusions about the founding of the United States (I recommend Revolutions by Mike Duncan). I know full well the British were a brutal colonial power, even so what\u2019s your point? Debt peonage and Labor Bondage DOES NOT equal Chattel Slavery and you are dishonest for trying to conflate the two. \n\nEven so, I was talking about how the White, Land Owning Men (you know, the only people who were allowed to sign, enforce, and vote on the Republic) of America decided they didn\u2019t like being told how to run their land.\n\nTaxes played a very big part but the start of the revolution like divisions were tied to disagreements about English Common Law. Somerset v Stewart (c1772) ruled that Chattel Slavery was not compatible with English Common Law, With some Brits going so far as to say \u201cwe are told, that the subjugation of Americans may tend to the diminution of our own liberties; an event, which none but very perspicacious politicians are able to foresee. If Slavery be thus fatally contagious, how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of slaves?\u201d - Dr. Samuel Johnson c1775\n\nMy entire point, which you missed by the way, was that this country was founded by white, land owning men to run their outfits as they see fit, up to, and including chattel slavery. Ignorance of the facts of the founding fathers and the founding of the United States doesn\u2019t make it any less true and straw-manning \u201cbut the British were bad too!!!\u201d Isn\u2019t the argument you think it is.",

It's almost like the whole thing is designed to make zero sense, with the only coherent aim being to piss off people who are in opposition. \nIt's like that playground bullying tactic where the bully just says anything to catch the victim off guard and put them on the back foot, and then laugh at them.",

If decades of trust and cooperation can be erased with a single election, then there is nothing to ever trust again.\n\nThe same answer that will always be true in global capitalism: *Money*. Our GDP is about $10T (trillion) more than the whole of the EU. Money talks. Money is what has got us into this mess. And it will be what gets us out.\n\nA more complicated answer is that our attention spans are short, and getting shorter by the day with the advent of TikTok and social media. We were able to forgive the Germans of committing atrocities. Assuming America comes back from this authoritarian fascist tangent and World War 3 doesn't annihilate all of us, I'd wager that the world would forgive us within ... 5 to 10 years, give or take ... especially if there were signs that democratic norms were returning and a more stable government resumed. Not sure how hopeful I am of that though. \n\nKeep in mind, this doesn't come from a place of American exceptionalism or arrogance. I hate that my country is doing what it is doing. I hate Trump, and this administration, and they're doing untold damage to our country and the world. But the capitalist wheel will keep on turning, and the world can not suddenly do without 30 trillion dollars in economic output.",

I'm using speech to text on my phone right now.\n\nYeah, so that's basically the entire point of building foreign currency reserves.  You trade goods for currency and at a later time this allows you to do a number of things. One, prop up your currency, if needed, by buying your currency on the world market and two, trade with other countries for their goods.  Because the US has been a bastion of stability and a provider of shipping security among other types of global security, our currency has been used as a medium of exchange between other countries.\n\nSo what this means is that, say, the United States wants some coffee?  Well we can go to Jamaica and say okay. We're going to give you some dollars in the form of paper, money and entries in a bank database for your coffee.  And Jamaica says okay and we get coffee and they get some dollars.  And Jamaica is like \"okay, great, we need some oil\" and they can turn around and go to a country like Nigeria and trade them these dollars for oil or gasoline or whatever.\n\nNow this takes place through the mechanism of modern capitalism which is the corporation, so it's a bit obfuscated.  But at the end of the day, the dollar is some medium of exchange which is an abstraction of value.  And the only entity that can bring them into existence is the Federal reserve and other banks through both normal lending + various stimulus or quantitative easing programs.  So effectively we are creating these value tokens out of thin air as a country and they ultimately make their way into the treasuries of other countries via corporation to corporation trade in exchange for them sending goods to us.\n\nSo this is what I mean by we export paper, which is a bit of a metonymic turn of phrase just meaning money, and security, which is a turn of phrase for our global Maritime naval dominance among other security apparatuses that makes global free trade possible, in exchange for goods, is that we effectively create value tokens out of the ether and create the environment for trade to happen, thus people give us goods.  We don't actually have to produce commensurate exports of real goods and services in order to receive these goods, like almost every other country.  We basically have created the infrastructure to allow trade to happen, and then create tokens that people want to use for that trade.",

Russia and China know this to be the only way they gain and valuable territory in the next great conflict. They need the U.S. out of the picture and Trump is the one to do it. But he can't do it outright, he'll look too obvious. So they went and conjured that bullshit narrative of free loading.

The Germans were forced to keep powerful forces in the West that would have otherwise been moved to the Eastern front. Not to mention US assistance through lend lease.\n\nThe allies likely don't defeat Germany without US involvement, but the same thing is true about each of the other Ally members as well. \n\nActing like America is France's savior is still stupid though, especially considering Frances involvement in the Revolution.",

And it made the most cynical sit up and take notice when we learned from German field officers that the Germans in central France were truly terrified, had to live under arms, could not move freely, had lost all control in sizable sectors even before we came ... It was a military fact that the French were worth at least a score of divisions to us, maybe more. [score of divisions: ~ 300,000]",

I guess by your logic, Poland also allied with the nazis))? At this very same time, the USSR was trying to make an anti-nazi alliance with the UK and France and were rejected by both. Then, after several other European countries signed non-agression pacts with the nazis, the soviets did the same with the MR pact and when Germany invaded Poland, the USSR did the same to give themselves a land buffer between the German border with them and Moscow. The soviets knew from the start that Germany would try invading them and they were looking to buy more time to re-arm and industrialise after having just recently left feudal backwater status of development. That's why they invaded Poland, they weren't \"joining Nazi Germany\" to divvy up the territory, they invaded another sovereign country that would have been fully annexed by the nazis to maintain further distance between where the Germans would launch the invasion and Moscow",

A buffer zone between the USSR & Germany didn't do much for the USSR, considering they moved much of their industry east anyway.

I'd say having a few more thousand kilometers between your army and the source of its supplies is a pretty big difference and contributed massively to the war effort on the Eastern front (also prevented like half of Poland from being placed in ghettos and/or concentration camps with said occupation (unknown side effect at the time but still something to keep in mind)). Stalin also didn't listen to his advisors telling him that the German invasion would be sooner than he expected which screwed up the initial defenses. If you have a Germany with the entirety of Poland along with Stalin having an incorrect assessment of when the invasion would be, the war would either be over quicker since they'd try to capitulate the USSR and would have far more ease doing it with established supply lines and a far shorter route to Moscow or you'd have far more than the 27 million deaths the USSR had during WW2 (18 mil of which were civilians) and also a longer war since the Germans wouldn't have to focus as hard on the Eastern front",

Moltov-Ribbentop (where this myth originates) was essentially the same pact that Britian and France signed with the nazis in years prior, but red scare propaganda put special placement on it because they wanted to downplay the fact that the USSR got the majority of Nazi attention and why in the 50s were given credit by the majority of the population as the primary contributor to winning the war",

And in the end the exchange was unnecessary as the German Garrison was already heavily besieged by the FFI and resistance, keen to surrender as the German military governor didn't really want to damage Paris that much (he had already ignored orders to burn the city earlier in the uprising). If anything the liberation would've gone over much better with the additional motorized infantry as there would've been a much larger force to clear the city-- there were still German snipers lingering for days.",

The summer of 1942 sees the Germans surge and take [thousands of square miles of Soviet lands.](https://i.imgur.com/XTlsE9X.png)\n\nEarly November, 1942, [American and British forces, commanded by American General D.D. Eisenhower, begin to take back Africa.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CqGeAmVu1I&t=437s).  By May 1943, Africa is secure.  The Soviet army takes advantage of Germany having two fronts, and takes back some land, but enters another stalemate.\n\nEarly September 1943, the Allies, again under the command of Gen. Eisenhower, [had taken Sicily, and Italy sued for peace.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CqGeAmVu1I&t=550s)  Germany cancelled off a major offenive in Kursk to divert troops to occupy Italy against the Allies.  In an operation called \"Hans! Look over there, Americans!\" the Soviets finally started to push back in earnest.  \n\n**This was the key turning part of the War.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn D-Day, 06-Jun-1944, allied forces, led by General Eisenhower with 24 U.S., 14 British and 3 Canadian infantry, armored and airborne divisions, [landed in Normandy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CqGeAmVu1I&t=656s)  Germany could not successfully defend three fronts.  Eventually the Soviets reclaimed their own territory and Poland, while the Americans, British and re-established French liberated the rest of Europe.  In an agreement, the latter forces stopped short of Berlin, and allowed the Soviets catch up and eventually hammer the city and surrounding area before taking it.\n\nWithout America's involvement, all of Europe and the western part of the Soviet Union would have remained under German rule.  \n\nThanks, America!\n\nYou're welcome, Europe!",

            "body": "This Reddit comment contains a mix of truth, exaggeration, and conspiracy theories. Let\u2019s break it down piece by piece:\n\n1. \u201c1930s to \u201940s oil was sold to the Nazis\u201d\n\n\u2022 Partially true: Before WWII officially began, American companies, including Standard Oil, did business with Germany. However, after the war started, the U.S. imposed embargoes and restrictions. Some American companies were accused of skirting these embargoes through foreign subsidiaries, but direct U.S. government-sanctioned trade with Nazi Germany largely stopped after war was declared in 1941.\n\n2. \u201cIBM famously assisted with the cataloguing of Jewish people\u201d\n\n\u2022 True: IBM, through its German subsidiary (Dehomag), provided punch card technology that helped the Nazis organize logistics, including tracking Jewish populations. Edwin Black\u2019s book IBM and the Holocaust details this extensively. However, the extent of IBM\u2019s knowledge and direct involvement is debated.\n\n3. \u201cCoca-Cola was huge in Germany until the US declared war\u201d\n\n\u2022 True: Coca-Cola had a large presence in Germany before the war. When the U.S. entered the war and trade was cut off, Coca-Cola\u2019s German branch created Fanta to keep operations going without imported ingredients.\n\n4. \u201cFord and General Motors sold vehicles to France knowing they were being used by Nazi forces\u201d\n\n\u2022 Partially true: Before the war, Ford and GM had subsidiaries in Germany. After the war started, their German plants were effectively taken over by the Nazi government and repurposed for war production. Some historians argue that the companies didn\u2019t do enough to stop this, but they were not directly supplying the Nazis during the war. The claim about France is unclear; if the commenter means before France fell to the Nazis in 1940, there\u2019s little evidence U.S. companies knowingly supplied the Germans via France.\n\n5. \u201cThe US Government with their non-aggression acts have been shown to be incredibly harmful to the British, French, and other allies\u201d\n\n\u2022 Partially true: Before the U.S. entered the war, its official stance was neutrality (e.g., the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s), which limited military aid to Britain and France. However, Roosevelt pushed back against isolationism with the Lend-Lease Act (1941), which provided significant aid to the Allies. While early neutrality policies may have delayed support, the U.S. did eventually supply massive resources to the war effort.\n\n6. \u201cThere\u2019s a book and a documentary which Kings and Generals reference\u2026 that claims the US knew that Pearl Harbor was going to be a target, but allowed it so they could declare war\u201d\n\n\u2022 Mostly false (conspiracy theory): This is a common but widely debunked theory. While there were intelligence failures and signs of an impending attack, there is no credible evidence that the U.S. government deliberately allowed Pearl Harbor to be bombed as a pretext for war. The McCollum memo and other sources suggest some in the U.S. expected a Japanese attack somewhere, but not necessarily at Pearl Harbor.\n\n7. \u201cWW2 is full of contradictions of actions in the Allied forces, but for many in Europe, it\u2019s America that baffles most.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Subjective: The Allies made complex and sometimes contradictory decisions during the war. The U.S. took time to enter the war, had corporate ties to pre-war Germany, and made controversial strategic choices, but it also played a decisive role in defeating the Axis powers.\n\n\n\nVerdict:\n\n\n\nThis comment contains some historical truths mixed with misleading claims and a conspiracy theory. The factual parts are often oversimplified or lack important context.",

Look over there, Americans!\" the Soviets finally started to push back in earnest.  \n\n**This was the key turning part of the War.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn D-Day, 06-Jun-1944, allied forces, led by General Eisenhower with 24 U.S., 14 British and 3 Canadian infantry, armored and airborne divisions, [landed in Normandy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CqGeAmVu1I&t=656s)  Germany could not successfully defend three fronts.  Eventually the Soviets reclaimed their own territory and Poland, while the Americans, British and re-established French liberated the rest of Europe.  In an agreement, the latter forces stopped short of Berlin, and allowed the Soviets catch up and eventually hammer the city and surrounding area before taking it.\n\nWithout America's involvement, all of Europe and the western part of the Soviet Union would have remained under German rule.  \n\nThanks, America!\n\nYou're welcome, Europe!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh, and Thanks France, for making the whole American Revolution thing possible.",
