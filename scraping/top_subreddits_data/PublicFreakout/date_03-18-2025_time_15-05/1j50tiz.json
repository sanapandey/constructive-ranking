Fortunately our mod team does a good job of removing posts that violate the Reddit Rules. u/ezziboo notably is excellent at enforcing Reddit Rules when it comes to posts so there is not much risk in voting on posts here.\n\nYou will want to be extra cautious of how you are voting on comments. \n\nWe often sticky comments asking that you not leave or engage with violent comments. These comments can get the subreddit restricted or banned. These comments can get your accounts striked or suspended.\n\nYou can report violent comments directly to us under rule 3. This report will only come to us. You can also report them to both us and admin by reporting them as threatening violence.\n\nThe quicker you report the sooner we as mods can remove these comments. These comments remaining up on the subreddit will effectively serve as honeypots for admin warnings for voting. We as mods do not want to see you get sanctioned for the way you vote. Please help us help you not get lured into warnings.",
