And sees it, as he sees most  this, as transactional. He assumes that pushing countries to invest in their own defense also means that they wil be buying from the US. I don't think that this is going to be true though.\n\nWe are not going to forget that the US can be an unreliable partner, and will likely invest massively in our own defense. This will have 2 effects: Europe will become the superpower it should already be and the US will become less relevant in the World.\n\nIt really is a Win-Win for Europe and a Loss-Loss of the US.\n\nI could not imagine myself saying this just 2 months ago, but I do not see the US as an ally anymore. I fear that, living in Europe, I am not alone with this feeling. It does seem that Americans are quite unaware of the anger and angst their country has caused here. I don't see that going away anytime soon.",

Post-WW2, it was more widely known that the Soviet army did a lot of the heavy lifting on the Eastern front, and people who'd live through WW2 tended to see the Soviets as the primary winners of the conflict.
