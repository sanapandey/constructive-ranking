An obvious one is plastic looking skin. But I look at the background, look at complex but simple concepts like door hinges or collars and buttons on a shirt or jacket, does the hair morph into itself. Even with super realistic models, AI tends to always blur the background, so subjects and mediums always look the same. Also subjects tend to always be centered in the frame.\n\nYou'll really notice when you see fake movie trailer AI videos. Even the well done ones. They look like animated stills vs a camera moving in a 3D world. And biggest giveaway..no realistic background crowds people and no multiple subjects that are the focus of one shot. Try to simulate any scene from a movie where a group of people are talking. It's almost impossible to get the blocking right, and even if you could, multiple, distinct unique characters are still hard to do. For example if you do a video or even photo of say, the Trump Family. You'll get a couple trump hairstyles on different people and a JD Vance face thrown in there somewhere.",

Terrible what is happening in Ireland right now but Conor will fix it. He's a strong guy and will know what to do. Hey, how about we have some MMA matches at the Kennedy Center? That would be great, wouldn't it? It would be something nobody has ever seen. And we all know how strong John F Kennedy was. He's related to my good friend RFK who is also really strong. It would be fantastic to have a strong event featuring strong men at a place named after one of the strongest Presidents this country has ever seen. I'll go so far as to say that JFK may have been stronger than me. Maybe. But maybe not. But we'll never know. Tragic, his death was. He was treated almost as poorly as I have been. But not quite. Also, if we hold an MMA fight here, we will make a LOT of money. And that will be good for the economy. Fantastic.\"",

At no point can I hear anyone other than Trump saying anything, except for a fragment at the very end.\n\nI really can't deduce anything from this, other than Trump's on one of his hobby horses as per usual. And even the fact that that hobby horse isn't or may not be relevant to the meeting or the audience doesn't tell me much because it's no different to the way he's been behaving for the past 10 years at least.\n\nSo jumping from that to he's got dementia, or he's got Alzheimers seems like a huge leap that isn't supported by the evidence at hand. Maybe he does have some sort of dementia, but I don't really see that conclusion being inherently deducible from this clip.\n\nAnd yet people are acting like it's some huge revelation? I really think those of you in that camp all need to calm down. There's enough mud to throw at this prick without the need to make up unqualified medical \"diagnoses\", when all that achieves is undermine the argument against him and make the left look as much like cranks as MAGA does.\n\nI am of course prepared for the storm of downvotes the above will provoke.

It would be fantastic to have a strong event featuring strong men at a place named after one of the strongest Presidents this country has ever seen. I'll go so far as to say that JFK may have been stronger than me. Maybe. But maybe not. But we'll never know. Tragic, his death was. He was treated almost as poorly as I have been. But not quite.

Terrible what is happening in Ireland right now but Conor will fix it. He's a strong guy and will know what to do. Hey, how about we have some MMA matches at the Kennedy Center? That would be great, wouldn't it? It would be something nobody has ever seen. And we all know how strong John F Kennedy was. He's related to my good friend RFK who is also really strong. It would be fantastic to have a strong event featuring strong men at a place named after one of the strongest Presidents this country has ever seen. I'll go so far as to say that JFK may have been stronger than me. Maybe. But maybe not. But we'll never know. Tragic, his death was. He was treated almost as poorly as I have been. But not quite. Also, if we hold an MMA fight here, we will make a LOT of money. And that will be good for the economy. Fantastic.\"",
