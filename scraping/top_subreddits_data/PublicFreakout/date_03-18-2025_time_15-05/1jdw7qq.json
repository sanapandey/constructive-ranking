(Don't even possess the self awareness of it)\n\nI guess their tik toks and Etsy stores, and self made cam whores, and all other things that come with the \"grind\" culture is just seeping in so hard.  The Uber drivers and other contract employees across all sectors, who are adopting a \"business first\" mindset just because that's what they're being forced I to. \n\nWhich just talks to another root problem, when economic factors are so fucking important that everyone needs to think they have a mind on \"business\". Because 'everyone needs a grind' mentality is causing all to be subservient to the economic factors that are grinding us down. \n\nFuck. It's so frustrating",

The whole idea that Uber or Influencer is a job where you are the boss is kinda a joke. You work for someone else as an at will employee. And those influencers, take a week off to rest and enjoy yourself. You will become irrelevant. That is an exhausting job. Constantly entertaining people with whatever you can dream up. \n\nTrump has been scamming and scheming since the late 1980\u2019s. I am goddamn old. I remember his shit back in those times. If it weren\u2019t for the apprentice he would still be creating businesses that are designed to fail so he can siphon off money before declaring bankruptcy. His business model is being superior conman. He had conned all these people out of their votes and money contributions.\n\nBeing President of the United States allows him to create one of the biggest cons and thefts of wealth in modern history.",

And these type of people only see that when it effects them. Especially black and Mexican people(using both terms as just general). While these things that he is doing effects everyone and I've seen realizations in all races. I think it's definitely funny seeing a black man walking around with a maga hat even though it's very known trump would probably make this country only for white people if he could. And mainly white men at that.\n\n\nI would also love to add, no matter what race you are. If you are poor, or middle class he hates you just as much.",
