Kids can tell when their parents hate each other and so many times people end up being better parents when they\u2019re not together.",

But how!? She was so mean to him!!\n\nAnd as for my dad, I called him a coward for cheating. He said he stayed because he was the breadwinner and didn't want us to go without... But we did anyway, because when mom kept catching him cheating she would go absolutely nuts and spend all the money to try and keep him around (house renovations, a big boat, new cars) while I went to school hungry without lunch money.\n\nHe should have told her he wants a divorce and they should have talked about it and then DONE it. They did eventually separate but never did anything official. She died 2 years ago and my sister said it's been Hell trying to handle what little assets she had because my dad drags his feet signing (executor rights? I don't remember) over to her.\n\nJust get the divorce, handle the fallout with some grace, the kids will be fine.",

Even my kids will tell you each home is way happier than the single one ever was (that they recall). And we have such different life choices! I now have a house like I always wanted, he\u2019s still rentingthe same apartment by choice. His gf stays at home, I'm the breadwinner. I'm a DIYer^1, he's a buyer. Even our deco styles are opposite. Only thing we do the same is we have the same minivan (down to the model and year lol) and support our kids unequivocally. We are just so different it was toxic and yeah, things absolutely were harder for a while but holy hell has it been worth it. \n\n^1 overshare: I stopped 1/2 way through this comment to repot a plant and bring the 70\u2019s chandelier I am restoring in. My husband is making a range hood to replace our bum above stove microwave with its own parts and hammered copper from spare piping - he's hammering the copper right now. Ex isn't a plant person, and would loathe the range hood. I shared how root bound the plant is and how happy it\u2019ll be to breathe with my husband. Also getting more excited with each part of his range hood plus we just geeked out over having a *fricking anvil*.",

If she's feeling alone of course she won't want sexy times. \n\nOr maybe she's just terrible. Sometimes people are.\n\nBut I think they need to learn to communicate, but it also reads like he wants permission to cheat, so they may be too far beyond repair. Communication can do so much and heal so much and I really do hope he/they give it a try before the resentment builds too high to overcome.",

Love is showing pride in each other and the home you make together. Love is teamwork. Love is cleaning up the bathroom because you're the one who drips. Love is when she unrolls your socks before putting them in the washer.",

You\u2019ll be frustrated or she\u2019ll be frustrated. Be patient.\u00a0\n\nLearn how to manage conflict before you get into the middle of a blowup. But if you make a mistake and the blowup comes first figure out what you\u2019re going \u00a0do next time so you can avoid it. Have a plan just like you would for any emergency.\n\nNever say words you can\u2019t take back. Be kind and generous with your compliments.\u00a0\n\nDo chores and share the work. Don\u2019t keep score though. Some days one of you will do more work than the other, but if you take care of each other and you communicate, it\u2019s all going feel balanced over time.\n\nKnow that sometimes it\u2019ll be harder than you thought it would be. That\u2019s normal. Expect things to change. That\u2019s normal too. Always remember what you love about one another talk to one another and you\u2019ll figure it all out.",

Somehow he thought that this modus vivendi could be sustained long term.\n\nSometimes people aren't terrible, but they're just incapable of deep attachment.

(Official diagnosis)\n\nYou are giving her too much credit. \n\nThis reads exactly how I would have written it. \n\nSure some men are emotional babies and their wives are run ragged and don't want sex. But they never read like this does. \n\nHe doesn't know what he wants. Well that's not 100% true. He wants her to be like she was. When she was love bombing regularly. That's what he fell in love with because he thought that's who she was. \n\nAnd he understands that things can change, but he doesn't recognise this person anymore. He doesn't know how to deal with the person he has devoted his life to suddenly being a completely different person. \n\nIt's the most miserable and lonely feeling on earth. Nobody would believe what things are really like. Outwardly everything looks good. She talks about him like he is the best man on earth. But in private, he can do nothing right, ever. \n\nHe sounds about my age. And dating again in your mid to late thirties, early forties, is not fun. \n\nBut if I could tell him one thing, it would be this. Run. Leave her and rebuild. It's taken me almost 10 years. But I'm about to get my kids off her and I've rebuilt my life better. Mainly because I haven't had to deal with her draining our money on the next thing we had to have to make her happy. \n\nI've made sure to always see my kids as much as possible. They see what she is and what I'm not. It's good to be able to be the stable rock for them. \n\nBut you're wrong there is no fixing this. She needs the drama. Constant drama. She needs the public praise. And she's never going to be who she was at the beginning ever again. Except for brief periods when she wants something. In my case it was each time she wanted another kid. \n\nIt makes me really sad to see how fast people are to dismiss a man in pain.",

It takes two to Tango, as they say.\n\nEven in my marriage to my abusive BPD wife, about half the time she exploded our relationship, it started with a kernel of truth about why she was upset with me. I can look back and both say that I never deserved to be treated with such disdain and violence, and also that I could've been such a better partner. However the one does not excuse the other.\n\nI would go out on a limb and say, statistically, it's a safe bet that she's handling a lot of the house management, child rearing, and potentially even emotional management of the house. Being touched out and over burdened will do this. The question is if she has really sat down and communicated her needs with him or if it's always \"snapping\". Because I've been that guy, and snapping simply doesn't have a positive outcome. A clueless dude who doesn't understand what you're doing won't learn a thing except \"she's angry again\".\n\nAnyways after my marriage I made communication my number one priority and basically put down some boundaries for the women I dated. And I could tell it helped us figure out things so much earlier than it would have.",

For one thing, women are culturally expected to take the hit to their careers, even when they are the primary earner. \n\nYes, if you are giving birth and then breast-feeding, you have to take time off. But, after that key period, women are still, statistically, doing the bulk of childcare, domestic labour, household management, mental and emotional labour in their families - even if they are the primary breadwinner. \n\nIn fact, statistically, women who out-earn their male partners do even more domestic labour. \n\nStudies have shown that women who perform a significant amount of household labour, especially in relationships with men, report lower sexual desire for their partners. \n\nWomen often feel resentful or undervalued if they perceive the division of labour as unfair, leading to decreased desire. When women are doing the majority of the housework, they start to view their partners as a dependent, which often negatively impacts their sexual attraction to them. The physical and emotional burden of excessive household labour can also lead to stress and exhaustion, which can negatively impact sexual desire.\n\nSo\u2026 you know.

Most victims of violence are women. You can verify these statistics yourself. \n\nSince you brought that up, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a man. I am a woman. Most of the women I have known in life have been victims of abuse cycles in their relationships.  I have experienced this in about 25% of my relationships. I can give you insight on how I have gotten trapped in this pattern, despite being intelligent, despite having been through it before. \n\nIf you are interested, I can give you insight on what specifically is in this man\u2019s writing that gives red flags. Which words, which sentences, and which information that is left out. I would bet real money that his wife is not abusive and he has some anger and control issues, just from his description of her behavior.\n\nAlso, thank you for the recommendations.  I\u2019m on a little healing journey myself and I\u2019m also reading Codependency No More by Beattie.\n\nEdit: also also also your point on \u201cwhy do women always\u2026\u201d is but one tactic men use to deflect and provoke.

The rest was from more recent studies. \n\nThe part about stress levels, cortisol etc is from a 2021 study called *Women\u2019s wellbeing and the burden of unpaid work* published by the BMJ. \n\nThe loss of career is from a huge number of studies over decades that all reinforce each other.\n\nThe part about women who out-earn their partners doing more domestic labour is from several sources, including a 2023 Pew Research Center study, a 2010 \u2018Money Isn\u2019t Everything\u2019 Study, a 2022 study called Gendered Housework: Spousal Relative Income, Parenthood and Traditional Gender Identity Norms published in Sage Journals,  etc. \n\nThe part about studies showing that women lose sexual attraction to their partners when they perceive them as dependent due to unequal household labour was sourced from \u2018Gender Inequities in Household Labor Predict Lower Sexual Desire\u2019 (2022) published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior; two studies with more than 1,000 women from around the world conducted by the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences at the University of Melbourne (as written about in places like The Conversation and Psychology Today in 2024 by the researchers); and the 2024 Bare Marriage study. \n\nAnd there are also other very recent studies that say similar things:\n\nA 2023 study on gender and time use by the Australia Institute Centre for Future Work found that women in Australia still perform a disproportionate amount of unpaid work, including housework and childcare. The study emphasises the need for policy changes to address this imbalance.\n\nIn 2024, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) published data showing women still spend more time on unpaid domestic activities than men, reinforcing the persistent gender gap.\n\nA 2023 UN Women report found that women globally spend nearly three times (2.8 hours more per day) as much time on unpaid care and domestic work as men. This gap is largest in regions like Northern Africa and Southern Asia, where women spend 4 more hours daily than men. Even in high-income countries, women do nearly double the unpaid work compared to men (3.8 vs. 2 hours per day).\n\nA review by Free Policy Briefs showed that during the pandemic, women disproportionately shouldered increased household and care duties. Even before COVID-19, women performed over two-thirds of unpaid domestic work globally, with no country achieving parity.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) highlights that unpaid domestic work constitutes a significant share of global GDP if monetised and is a primary factor keeping many women out of the labor force or in marginal employment.\n\nThe Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (2022) found that during COVID-19, women were 10x more likely than men to report handling childcare. Gender remained a key predictor of household labour division, regardless of employment status. Women consistently performed more tasks even when employed, highlighting persistent inequalities\n\nThe EIGE Gender Equality Index (2021) found that in Europe, 91% of women with children spend at least an hour daily on housework compared to 30% of men. Employed women spend 2.3 hours daily on housework versus men\u2019s 1.6 hours. Gender roles entrenched in childhood perpetuate these disparities.\n\nA 2021 study - Gender Gap in Housework Time - of heterosexual married Americans found that women perform significantly more housework across categories like cleaning, cooking, and grocery shopping. Men\u2019s contributions remain limited despite women\u2019s increased participation in paid work.\n\nThe 2023 OECD G7 Gender Equality Report found that, while progress has been made in gender equality commitments, unpaid domestic labour remains a significant barrier to women\u2019s economic participation across G7 countries.\n\nA 2024 study, called Cognitive Household Labor, of 322 US mothers found that women disproportionately handle cognitive labour tasks, such as planning and organising household responsibilities. This imbalance was linked to higher stress, depression, burnout, and poorer relationship quality for women.\n\nThe US 2021 study Gender Gap in Housework conducted research on heterosexual married Americans and showed women consistently perform more housework across categories like cleaning, cooking, and grocery shopping, even when both partners work full-time.\n\nThe 2022 The Lancet Review found that, among employed adults, unpaid labor was found to negatively impact women\u2019s mental health significantly more than men\u2019s. The review highlighted persistent inequities in unpaid labor across Europe.\n\nA 2023 Canadian study, called Cognitive Labor, found that take on a greater share of cognitive labour, such as anticipating needs and delegating tasks. This \u201cmental load\u201d contributes to stress and worsens mental health outcomes for women.\n\nThese studies align with earlier findings, and underline the ongoing gender disparities in both physical and cognitive household labour across Western countries and the world, with significant consequences for women\u2019s mental health and well-being.\n\nWhile it\u2019s valid to consider the age of research, the core issues highlighted in the older studies (unequal division of labour, impact on women\u2019s well-being) remain relevant and are supported by more recent data.\n\nAlso, 2005 wasn\u2019t as retrograde as you seem to think it was. LOL! \n\nSure, SOME men are doing a lot more. I have many men in my life who are like this. However, others are backsliding or remaining pretty static and the overall data remains pretty damning. \n\nI know clean men and messy women too. But that\u2019s not the whole picture. Your personal anecdotes multiplied don\u2019t equal data. Neither do mine. \n\nWould you like to play some more? \ud83d\ude09",

I would just ask if the recent studies, which seem to be more prevelant here account for remote work? Semi afk 6 hours a day would warrant a few extra hours if the man is out longer.  In my case, when I worked from home, I'd have a bit more time to catch up on things like laundry, and since I was cooking my own lunches , if there were some extra dishes in the sink for example sometimes I'd do them.  If I had a light day I'd use the time saved from no commute to start errands or dinner early.  It wasn't 3 hours worth of work per day, but it probably added up if hairs were split.  \n\nAlso with regards to the studies about covid increasing women's likelihood of handling childcare 10x, did that factor in or account for which companies closed and which didn't, or how many of those were the results of layoffs where the husband kept his job (remember with the financial relief at the time those women would have been essentially paid to stay home in those cases).  I've seen a lot of studies across the board in recent years use broad scope data to make very specific inferences.\n\nI'd also like to point out (and this isn't a bash against women) that higher earning does not necessarily equal harder working, just think of all the newer jobs in finance and administrative fields (again, think work from home) where the job is mostly automated but still pays well.  Tbh we will see some of those jobs go away in the next few years as the tech adjacent and asset bubble bursts.  Don't forget men on average are working the harder labor jobs that are still essential (until those banks have managed to replace the worker or selloff the industry and put those workers on the street).  If a man is working 12 hours a day and the woman 8, should he still be doing the same amount as her at home,  genuinely asking?  According to Google, women average 36 hours a week and men 40.  I would assume this comes from a gender gap in industry, with men being usually more involved in manufacturing or construction adjacent industries, heavy industry blue collar which have been the hardest hit by all the aforementioned economic crises.\n\nThe exception I'll make is women in Healthcare and childcare, these are the hardest workers who should be supported the most, and with the hours they do work, either the husband is cooking, or there isn't any dinner, or there isn't a husband.  Unless you have a chart showing a study on home dynamics specifically including women in these fields and those numbers I'd argue they don't account for as much of the weighted data in the above studies, just due to the availability alone for doing work in the house (which is ofc fair).  That being said women in Healthcare and childcare do account for something like 30-40% of all working women, at least in America.  \n\nNow I do recall my childhood best friends mother - she worked 60+ hours a week nursing and as a single mom was raising an autistic child and it drove her absolutely insane.. she'd always say her ex husband didn't do enough and I could see that, but also she came up in the 80s and that was still the early 00s.  I just don't see things like that happening anymore, unless it's just older people still stuck in their older ways.\n\nI get that all I have here are anecdotal accounts, but I will say out of everyone that I know well enough to get a glimpse in their life, which isn't a tiny amount, men across the board are doing a lot more at home than in the past, in many cases meeting their spouse on equal.  I also see dad's being involved with their families a lot more, past just events and sports which is a good thing.   My group is late 20s / 30s, yeah us guys were a mess in early 20s but culture has changed alot since then, and so has everyone.  I also live in a more conservative area, albeit moderately so.\n\nAnyway that was sure a tangent if you've even read this far wouldn't blame you if you didn't, I guess what I'm trying to say is this OP was about an anecdote, and a wall of data really can't put perspective to an anecdote, and why push a narrative that could very well be out of context when we don't know the full story?  Also OPs situation sounds a bit like early 20s rushed family planning or accidental pregnancy turned into a trend.. probably an outlier that doesn't fit into a discussion about sex / gender roles.\n\nFor the record, I do appreciate the actual links and lack of toxicity compared to some others making the same claims.  I'm sorry I didn't provide any - I do read at least a few articles a day and do my own research on general info but don't ever save anything.",

They were very clear that both partners were working.\n\nBut nice try \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe harder earning / working stuff has no statistical relevance, it\u2019s a feeling/belief you personally have. It would also assume that all or most of the women in these studies work in jobs with fewer hours or physical labour than their partners? That\u2019s a wild assumption! So, no go bro. Not convincing as a counter-argument! It is an interesting variable to look at in general though.\n\nAnecdotes are cool, but personal anecdotes multiplied don\u2019t equal data or general trends. \n\nPersonally, I did *not* grow up with a lazy father. My father worked really long hours, he made us a plate of fruit and a (disgusting) vegetable juice for breakfast every morning, he is OCD so he was always cleaning or fixing things. Dude loves vacuuming and ironing! \n\nOn the flip side, my mum gave up her chosen vocation which she loved to help support his small business for his expertise (which he loves) in a boring role, because it made sense financially for the family. She did the vast bulk of childcare. All of the household management and mental load. All lunches and dinners. All holiday planning. Gifts for us and his family. Loads of domestic labour. \n\nSo\u2026 still room for improvement in the childcare / involvement in family stuff from my dad. \n\nMy male friends are all fantastic. Great co-parents, great partners. A lot of them were raised by mothers who were divorced or primary breadwinners, funnily enough\u2026 Two are the primary carer for their kids because their wives have bigger jobs. They all clean and are involved in  household management. My BIL is the same. \n\nSo, I have great examples of fantastic men all around me! And if I existed solely in my bubble, it\u2019d be easy to think that this was a universal trend. \n\nSadly, it\u2019s not. I do know other men who are not like this at all (not my friends, more partners of friends, colleagues, etc). I have heard endless stories of unequal labour. And I\u2019ve read just so many studies on this subject, as well as the essays of experts. \n\nI never assumed this man is definitely one who has a scenario of unequal labour in his own household. \n\nI prefaced the data with \u201cshe could be awful.\u201d \n\nAnd she might be! This man might be a victim of a shitty partner, even an emotional abuser - which makes it more difficult to leave. \n\nAnd, in fact, I have many times given advice to men whose stories do indicate emotional abuse that is in line with what I tell female victims. \n\nThis story has a lot of missing information though.\n\nAnd knowing stats, like the above, it\u2019s fair to be curious about the other point of view in this story. \n\nContext matters. General trends are often significant. \n\nThere have been SO MANY instances of men telling stories about their wives being mean / anxious / depressed / disconnected / asexual and when you get more information it turns out that their wives are simply burnt out and exhausted by the unequal labour. \n\nI don\u2019t think that women are inherently morally superior to men. I know there are plenty of horrible (or just lazy) women out there.\n\nBut looking at the statistics and general trends and seeing the way this is written makes me curious to hear the other side of the story. And I simply provided an explanation as to WHY I am curious. \n\nIt\u2019s quite amusing to me how much that upsets some people. LOL",

                                                                    "body": "> Anecdotes are cool, but personal anecdotes multiplied don't equal data or general trends\n\nPerhaps i should have been more succinct as this is really what drew me to your comment.  This is literally about an anecdote.  And to me it sounds a lot like some of the shit I'd have dealt with if I had children with my ex partner.  So why do we need a wall of data which only enables *assumptions* about his personal situation?  Not to mention, so many of those studies only accounted for maybe an hour a day of discrepency.. you can't tell me an hour a day difference is a determining factor into significant mental health problems more than the man, especially with even the context we've been given in this situation!  Unless you just don't believe OP.  But I'd believe it, I've seen this kind of behavior many times, covert narcisstic insecurity at it's finest.  I also blame our society for leading women to think that way and sure men do run this society so there's that.\n\nThere are some things that even this anecdote or your studies can't account for.. such as lifestyle lived based on region and how that accounts for the upbringing people have.. e.g. a rural community might not have the most balanced female role models, so contrast with modern media culture shock you might see a trend for entitlement among women who want a better place in life than their mothers had.. but without good role models or education people tend to stray too far or overcompensate.  I'm sure with all the ridiculous amounts of consumer and internet traffic data we have we could study these things, but tech would never allow it.\n\nReason I mention the regional divide is because I've been a lot to the city and there I see better examples of women who are working hard and earning, and yeah there's no excuse why they aren't supported better by their partners.  Pretty much everywhere else I haven't seen the same kind of professionalism, numbers represented, or attitude from women as a whole in the workforce.  Now it is mostly industrial / distribution / manufacturing jobs directly available in my area.  But I also know alot of people who work remote for out of state companies.  Most of the young millenial women I know make the best consumers, have the worst spending habits, and seem to work the least hardest jobs for the least hours, at least in this area.  They frequently take their spouses finances for granted, or even their own, if they are equal earners.  Those that don't do this have moved or commute to the nearest metro, which is an hour away.\n\nIs this everywhere? No. But I would bet most of your usual detractors that these kind of posts are aimed at would be experiencing something to this degree, and those numbers alone won't make your argument for you, even though in a general sense (out of OP context) I get where you're coming from.\n\nAgain I don't have links, and I realize there are exceptions to non blue collar jobs that have higher hours worked, but I did some research on this once and those fields would be things like tech and investment finance (80+ hours etc) and it's no secret that those are markedly male dominant professions.  In terms of highest hours worked, manufacturing, warehousing, and trades are definitely ranking next in terms of hours.  I'm happy to see women entering the trades, that's definitely on the rise, but for now it's still a 70/30 split at best, I mean just go find any job site or tour any manufacturing facility as I've done for many years now.  Again Healthcare would be the exception to that rule, where women are represented higher.\n\nWhy does that matter?  Because if men are working the most hours on some of the most physically demanding jobs as they still are across the board, I think that warrants a couple hours difference across an aggregate high level dataset that likely didn't factor in or weight for these specifics.  It's not just a personal feeling or pride about more hours, it's downright a requirement for some when it isn't for others.  You mentioned it would be a wild assumption to make that women are working less hours than men, but why is that so wild? That's a documented high level average.  Even if you're making an example out of specifically covid and dual wfh couples, some male dominant wfh roles (tech, finance, and management comes to mind as the largest) might require alot more hours than say, female dominant administrative/ coordinating roles.  Can the study rule that out? Because if not I'd say it's incomplete or potentially biased.  Wfh is declining anyway, and honestly I'd take any covid study about pretty much anything with a grain of salt now.  I mean just about every dataset in the world experienced an inversion or wild volatility, and while data is interesting, you can only draw short term conclusions from that. \n\nLook ill be honest with you, I like data, and if I had several hours more to waste tonight, I'd go and find some more concrete stuff to counter or back up what I'm saying. But that's not easy to find, and I don't work from home anymore, I work well above the weekly hours I listed with 3 hours a day commuting, and its time to sleep. I'm not saying you're wrong anyway, just that perhaps those studies don't factor into everyone's situation and perhaps are only looking through one or two lenses.",

(Even though I purposely said \u201cwhen you sound angry\u201d instead of \u201cwhen you are angry\u201d because I knew if I said she was angry while she was yelling at me and talking to me in a way that anyone in the world, including her, would interpret as being angry, she would just turn it into an argument about whether or not she was angry. Which she still did anyways). \n\nSo I can definitely understand how this man feels and I feel so bad for him that he can\u2019t leave. I still have to live with my ex until May and May can\u2019t come fast enough. I think if I had to stay in this relationship with no definitive end in sight, I would have a breakdown. I had scabs in my ears from picking at them when I\u2019m anxious, and they\u2019re gone now because she was gone for a week and during that week I stopped picking at them. This whole time I thought I just had really bad anxiety but I\u2019m starting to think most of my anxiety comes from being around her.",

She\u2019s always been like this it didn\u2019t just start. \n\nThe only reason I was able to stay so long was because I also had a mental health condition and I was basically addicted to the feeling I got from being in love with her. Now that I\u2019m better mentally and I\u2019m not addicted to that anymore I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve dealt with this for so long. \n\nI also had convinced myself that because she treats her friends good she would treat me good one day and because she talks about how much she loves and appreciates her mom, one day she\u2019ll love and appreciate me like that. Then I started paying attention to the fact that she talks to her mom the same way she talks to me. And I realized that she probably also tells other people how much she loves and appreciates me and then acts the complete opposite around me, and that\u2019s probably never going to change.",

For those of you speculating about how he has somehow brought it on himself all I can say is congratulations, you\u2019ve likely demonstrated why your own relationships have failed. Regardless of the details the part he gets 100% right is that everyone is entitled to be happy.

I made myself a financial martyr when I left my ex husband and I\u2019m in massive debt still (I really should\u2019ve filed bankruptcy to begin with and I\u2019d be more than halfway through the 7-year period it takes to fall off your credit report \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f dumb of me!

I wanted to stop feeling so lonely - which, as counterintuitive as it seems, once I was on my own in my little apartment, I felt less desolate and lonely. Alone but not *lonely*.\n\nAnyhoo, I would recommend speaking to a financial counselor/advisor who specializes in divorce (yep these exist!), and see what can be done to minimize the damage before making the step toward the Big D.\n\nIt can be done. People divorce every day, people with and without prenups (or post nups!), people with and without assets, people with and without debt, people with and without kids - every combination thereof. Sometimes the person who gets \u201cfinancially ruined\u201d doesn\u2019t even have a choice in the matter because they\u2019re the ones getting left! Somehow they figure it out, however that looks.\n\nDo what\u2019s necessary and be a grownup, stop whining and looking for there-there-now\u2019s and strangers\u2019 approval to cheat.",
