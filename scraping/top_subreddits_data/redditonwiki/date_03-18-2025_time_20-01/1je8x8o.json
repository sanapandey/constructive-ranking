    "selftext": "This was back in 2013 and takes place in California. I was 18 and my (ex)boyfriend, Alex, was 21.\n\nHe had a family friend, Katie (16f), who was living with Alex's family while her and her sister went to high school. Their parents lived in Texas at the time. They trusted Alex's parents and knew the girls wanted to finish high school with people they knew since they used to live in California. \n\nI always felt uncomfortable with Katie since she was pretty close to Alex. But he assured me, she's like a sister..... Besides, she has a crush on his brother, Caleb (28m), who is married to Marissa (in her mid 20s ish) with one son (2m) and another on the way. Katie and Caleb were definitely more than just family friends. \n\nCaleb is a dirt bag and is the reason I have such a bad taste in my mouth for Marines. He cheated on Marissa and contracted herpes, but swore it was from sharing a towel with a buddy. Marissa was also uncomfortable with Katie being around her husband, so she asked for a divorce. He went crazy, got super drunk, and broke his hand punching a tree branch. It was me, Alex and Katie (probably a couple of others but I can't remember) trying to calm him down. He kept trying to drive, so we called the cops. When they arrived, they just gave him a warning. As the were walking back to their patrol car, Caleb squared up to Alex for calling the cops. I stood between them and the cops went ahead and arrested them. Alex yelled at me for stepping between them because he believed that Caleb would've hit me trying to get to him. We got into a huge fight and I walked half a mile home in the middle of the night. \n\nHe got drunk with Katie and had sex with her. Somehow his family found out and they forced him to tell me, otherwise he wouldn't have. I wish I could say I was smart enough to recognize he was a pedophile, let alone a cheater, but I stayed with him. \n\nAnyway, Katie was sent back to Texas. \n\nCaleb decided to clear his mind and visit a marine buddy in Vermont. We all knew it was bull shit.\n\nMarissa was hanging out with us and the family, she was still pretty close with Caleb's family, and is venting about how she's pretty sure he's not visiting a friend and he's probably going to Texas to see Katie. Caleb's mom says \"don't you guys share a bank account?\" And you could see the light bulb in Marissa's brain light up. Sure enough, he was heading towards Texas to see Katie.\n\nIn fact, she snuck out in the middle of the night and was driving her back to California! She was 17 at this time, the age of consent in Texas, but once she was removed from Texas ....\n\nTHAT'S KIDNAPPING.\n\nDetectives called him trying to convince him to bring her back and the parents wouldnt press any charges and he argued with them, but ultimately brought her back to Texas. And he got an apartment for them to share intil she turned 18. And she returned pregnant. \n\nAs far as I know, they're still together.\n\nAs for Alex and I, you'll be happy to know we broke up after 3 years. Biggest waste of my life. He was absolutely a pedophile. We broke up because he was videochatting minors in the middle of the night while I slept. He was battling leukemia at the time of our break up, so he told everyone that I broke up with him because of his cancer and no one believed what I had to say. \n\nIt's okay. He's dead now. \n\nETA: When Alex and I broke up, I told him I was going south to visit family, but really I went north. He found out and Caleb sent me a message saying it was fucked that I would say I'm one place, but go to another..... Pot and kettle, amiright? \n\nAnother ETA: Whether you believe it or not, this is 100% real. I've also included real names. \n\n[Obituary here](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/times-standard/name/alexander-bieniek-obituary?id=9225192)",

That being, if you grow up/ are exposed to abuse in a normalized context, you don't understand what is and is not abuse.\n\nLike, not *exactly* the same scenario- but I had to be *forced* to understand how bad my mother's abuse was of me because it was all I knew. And I was a gifted student in advanced courses before my mom convinced me to drop out. I was raised being told it's only abuse if there are lasting marks. The idea of a bed or a room being a privilege you can lose- or, conversely having all your shit taken away save a bare mattress and locked in an empty room- were normal to me. That was \"reality discipline.\" And if none of my friends had to deal with it, that's because they were either better than me, or their parents were worse than her. \n\nIt took other people hearing me talk about my childhood like it was normal and seeing them tear up (and a long heated argument with my bf, bless him) to make me go *\"oh fuck. That's not normal\"*  and I'm still unlearning a lot of that shit.\n\nSo no, it's really not that unsurprising a girl with a history of being preyed upon by older men, entangled in a family of people who condone the behavior and from a family that is close enough to the others to send them teen girls- might not realize they and others like them were taken advantage of until they were old enough to be on the other side of the power dynamic and look at an 18 year old and go, *\"oh, fuck, that's not normal,\"",

My older sister arrived to my rescue before the teachers more often than not. \n\nAnd I also knew I was smart enough that I \"should have\" realized the person who normally bullies you now wanting to play hide and seek in the woods, away from all the adults and your protective older sister, during a football game where everyone else is distracted, is full of shit and means you harm. Like come on now, if it was in a book I'd have predicted the ending. I was so smart for my age  that I was allowed in the gifted program a year early *at the gifted school* so I \"should have\" figured it out and yet I still made that choice. Which was confusing as fuck to me at the time. \n\nTurns out, being smart does not override the desperate need for friendship and the naivety to believe someone has seen the error of their ways and wishes to validate your existence after denying it for months. 9 year olds do not have the mental capacity to override their emotional responses regardless of their intelligence.\n\n That plus *years* of conditioning to see the abuser's reality as *the* reality and it can really fuck a kid up.",

Like I said- my moms response to me noticing people outside of my house did shit differently was to either claim my friends were better than me (so they didn't get punished as much) or their parents were neglectful and *should* be punishing them like I got punished. And I mean, what friends I managed to make were people I looked up to and cared about- I didn't think they deserved that treatment, so it made sense that I wasn't an exceptionally bad kid.  So when I questioned things it wasn't \"why does my mom treat me worse than my friends parents treat them,\" it's \"why is it that everything I do to be good enough to be treated like other kids ends up failing?\"\n\nAnd when I mean brainwashed I mean *brainwashed* I had a mantra of \"you are wrong. You cannot be right because you are too stupid to think for yourself, so just accept what you're told and do what you're told,\" and accepting that I was a gifted student because I was only capable of being smart on paper and was otherwise a brainless moron for me beat less than trying to defend myself. It's was literally easier to accept I was flawed than accept I was in a situation where every move was a losing one. I call it the \"Zuko Paradox,\" it's easier to obsess over your supposed lack of  honor than face the fact that your dad mutilated a child and threw them out of a whole ass country, for *no reason other than he felt like it.* \n\nKids will do a lot of shit for parental love up to and including deluding themselves into seeing abuse as \"tough love,\" \n\n It also didn't help that my mom would find the worst stories of abuse possible, show them to me and my siblings, and insist we were lucky because *that* was abuse. \n\nAnd on top of that, my family moved around so much as a kid that I didn't really know anyone well enough to have them notice the insanity that was my home life until HS, and only because my bf and I dated long distance, and he had multiple stints of unadulterated time around my family, and a constant view of my daily life, so I never really got a chance to see how other families worked or how other parents reacted. I met other people's parents and went to their houses, but I never stayed the night, and they almost never came over to my house. \n\nAfter a while the call of reality gets drowned out by the mantra of the abuser. \"I am god and what I say is reality. Any evidence to the contrary is heresy and will be punished as such,\" \n\nAnd to bring this back into context with Oop- people have been preying on children for *generations.* There are more states with regulations for child marriage on the law books than states banning it. History is full of photographs of men next to their \"wives\" that are girls so young they have to stand on a chair to look their husbands in the eyes. Society is full of insular religious communities that arrange marriages for girls as soon as they are legally able and pull them out of schools. (Cults to consciousness is a great interview based podcast that goes into that subject if you are interested in *that* rabbit hole) \n\nSo if your gma was married off at 14 to the adult man who won her in a card game (which yes, is an account I read from an expose on the subject a while back) and your mother was idk,  married and a mother of 2+ before 20, you only dating a man 4 years older than you at 18, or being swindled to another state by a man a decade your senior isn't really that outside of your \"normal.\" \n\nShit my mom is the way she is because of the extreme child abuse *she* endured at the hands of her mother and other family members. And my great gma was even more abusive and was known for setting her dogs on her children if they resisted their beatings.  So when my mom *genuinely* argues that she is better than her mother and less abusive she is correct and to a kid that's a damn good argument. As an adult I realized she could be better than her mother and still atrocious all on her own- I do not have to lower the bar so she could use it as a ladder rung as she climbed out of hell. But I had to still ya k it back up to where it should be.\n\nOops did the same readjusting when she left her groomer. Yes, it would be wonderful and ideal if she has had that moment when her younger friend got kidnapped- but what's important is that she had it and escaped the cycle instead of passing it on to a child she had with her abuser.",

But being upfront that this isn't the *best* study I've used as a source.) \n\nThat being said, This is more common than people would like to admit. The \"guilt\" is entirely put on the teen girls for being \"slutty\" and no one bothers to figure out who knocked her up; let alone recontextualize the girls as being taken advantage of by adult men (who get to have consequence free sex with minors.)\n\n I know that the 3 highschools I went to before I dropped (yes I know it's kinda a lot, and a long story) each had multiple girls who had adult boyfriends. If their parents knew they tended to not give a shit, which makes sense because predators target the vulnerable. \n\nAnd I mean... Cops aren't known to be helpful when it comes to sexual assault and rape cases, especially when it's grooming and the victim is seemingly compliant with their abuse.",

Moves while they took 20 years to divorce. (I lose track, we stayed in some places as briefly as a month) I also had 4..?  elementary schools (may be misremembering a kindergarten as the first grade,) and 4 middle schools. And a stint of homeschooling between elementary school and middle school that ended up not counting because my parents decided to fucking wing it. So the 3 highschools was an improvement because I got to stay at the same school for the first time since elementary school.\n\nDropping out:\nMy mom convinced me to drop out because \"I'd be more useful to the family as part of the workforce and helping out around the house more\" aka she wanted me to pay her bills and raise the kid she had at 40. She was faking cancer? (I've seen her doctor paperwork enough to know she could take the proof shes shown me and multiple family members insist she was faking it, or has admitted as much to them. I cannot exactly prove one way or the other but I mean... She claimed to be too weak to work or do chores or childcare, but could drag me around by my hair and kick me hard enough to crack a rib when I was a 145lb teenager so there's bullshit somewhere it's just a matter of how big the pile is.)  And it was during a phase of my parents being hostile so she made it seem like I was being selfish by staying in school unless I had plans to go to college (which at the time she also had me convinced I'd be unable to do, in part because of her sabotage tanking my attendance in HS and at that time having my grades in jeopardy.)\n\nRight now I'm working fast food- but last year I got my GED and enrolled in college for an economics degree, which I plan to leverage into better employment and a better/ more specific degree for my goal of one day launching my own publishing company for graphic novels. (And being published myself) It's something Ive had as a goal since the 8th grade, but yeah, life got in the way for my first decade of adulthood.",

The high-horse is the judgement of OPs behavior. \n\nNo one, including OP, is claiming it wasn't dumb, but that doesn't mean that OP was in their right mind. Sure, plenty of teens (or even pre-teens) can know something is wrong at an intellectual level but still make choices that conflict with that knowledge.  \n  \nThe reasons for that kind of decision making are wildly varied - victims of abuse often have different motivations unless or until they get help or choose to change; some religious upbringings yield different values or at least yield different values for a while; sometimes it's just neglect and being left to ones own devices too young.... and a myriad of other things. Lots of factors can lead people to making decisions that aren't rational or are outside of what they are told is \"wrong\".   \n  \nThe point is that we don't really know what the life of OP was like and to make total sense of their decisions one would have to really know that very deeply. \n\nWe don't know and there isn't a compelling reason that OP should have to tell us anyway, so it's really a high-horse sort of mode to be in.",
