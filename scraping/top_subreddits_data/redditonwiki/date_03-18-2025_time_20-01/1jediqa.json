    "selftext": "for background, I'm a 17 y/o girl, and my ex is 19.\n\n  \nIn early February of last year, I met my ex-boyfriend, whom I'll call T. We were set up by a mutual friend, who didn't turn out to be a great fellow either, but that's for later. Me & T only dated for around six to seven months, not a sustainable amount of time, but we talked about many serious things. For example, while with him, I realized things I didn't know about how I dove into relationships. For example, I learned that I have bad jealousy issues. \n\nFour or so months in, I can't exactly remember since I have a very ill memory, he cheated on me with a distant friend. He was sexting her behind my back and had intent to bring things physically. I was playing with Snapchat on his phone when the message popped up. He began to freak out, so obviously, I clicked on the notifications. I won't get into detail, but it was *bad*. We were off and on, he cheated on me three times more before things got legally bad. He became erratic and was no longer the man that I knew before. \n\nFor one, he strangled a cat, recorded a video, and sent it to many people on campus. Then, he pushed me into oncoming traffic, which is self-explanatory. This is where we broke up for real, quit the on and off, though he still remained close. The most recent, he took an axe and mutilated a possum in his backyard, cut it up, and threw it into a pond. \n\nDisturbed, I contacted the coordinating people, but nothing was done. After admitting that he would use my past traumas to \"get me back\", I stirred into a mental breakdown. He continues to touch me, follow me, when I am not only in a healthy relationship, but have done the proper steps into avoiding him as much as possible. \n\nT has hurt me, scared me, and left deep scars that he continues to poke. I need advice and would love if the boys could give me any advice.",
