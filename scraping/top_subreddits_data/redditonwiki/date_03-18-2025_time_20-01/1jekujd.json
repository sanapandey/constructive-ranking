    "selftext": "Hi guys, I need some outside perspective, this will be a long one as context is needed. English is my second language and I have dyslexia so I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes \n\nContext: I have 4 siblings, in age order, older brother E, olde sister A, older sister I, and little (half) brother A. But we are going to focus on the older siblings for this.\nSo, my mother and father divorced when I was a toddler and later on my mom meet my stepdad L, they moved to the other side of the country with with us and later had my little brother. At the beginning L was fine and our mom was a mama bear. But slowly L started showing his true colours and became manipulative and psychologically abusive. He never physically hurt us (atleast not what I know of) but this led my mom into just going along with what was happening. For example as a early teen, he could scream at me until I had tears in my eyes, threaten me with giving me up and even locking me in my room for a month and a half and my mom would do nothing.\nI went to stay with my father for my later teens and found out that brother E had done some bad things to sister I and therfore would no longer be in contact, sister A decided to do the same with E. I however, went low contact as he was still my brother.\nMom talked to E but I and A said it wasn't enough and went low contact with her. And when I moved back to the same city my sisters lived at (cus they got kids now) I went low contact with her as well. Only a sister and mother group chat.\nWe sisters took a trip to see our uncle at his summer house and decided not to tell our mother in fear of her showing up with L. I then posted a picture of As dotter on FB and our mom asked why we didn't tell her and the chat exploded. Telling our mom we didn't want her there and why... almost 15 years of why. \nHow she stops defending us against L, she only wrote when she needed something, only asked to meet if it fits her schedule, how we never got anything we wanted but, just what she thought we needed (remeber those last 3) and how she could take E side after everything he did to I.\nAnd mom backed away. And my sisters went no contact while I went low low contact.\n\nWhen our father passed away a few years later, us sister decided to start a monthly meet up as life has a habit of getting in the way and that worked for about 2 months, I continued trying to get together but as they have kids, so  there was socer practice, dance recitals, swimming lessons in the way. I get it, kids come first. But even after saying, hey these are my work days and times, with no definite answer, I gave up. We now only get together for birthdays, Xmas, Easter and some other holidays sometimes.\n\n\nNow for the problem.\nNow me and sister I have a closer relationship, we don't talk everyday but there is the usual hang out and wine talk when her son is with his dad, and I of course babysitt him every now and then if I needs to go somewhere.\nHowever me and A have a somewhat, well, we have a few things in common and we get along, but I wouldn't say we are close... she is the house, husband and kids kind of person, while I'm a, working wifi and a few cats, kind of person. The only time I hear from here is when she needs me to babysitt and it's only on her demands. In the beginning she would be sneaky about it, asking me over for tea, I get there, they ask me to look over there dotter while they go shopping, return and then point out how late it is and drive me home. And then the manipulation started, \"but she ( my niece)  really wants to see you\" and \" she talks about you al the time\"  but when I offered I'd see her another day, nothing. Also A loves to ask me last minute, like I was the last option. I've even pointed out to A and her husband when I'm on vacation if they wanna hang out and yet, only when I'm needed.\nI'd find out from my niece and nephew that they went to the amusement park or whatever. And no one asked if I wanted to go. \nNow I love my niece, and I'm happy to hang out with her whenever, but the way A asks and the ways she does, I can't do it. Not if I want to keep the mental and psychological work I've already done on myself after L. \n\nWhen sister I turned 29, A gave her consent ticket to another city, they went for the weekend and A paid for everything except the fod and drinks while there.\nWhen I turned 29, I got a storm set, ( a sort of rain and wind, jacket and pants combo) Now, I'm the person that will were my leather jacket until I HAVE to bring out the winter coat. And it wasn't like I wasn't hinting on birthday presents before hand. \nI can clearly see the I'm not the favourite sister, and that's fine, but the way I get treated by A, at the same time she's hates on mother (whenever the topic comes up) of how mom was to us, is bugging me.\n\nI wanna talk to her about it, without her dotter or husband, but I'm afraid that she will get mad at me, dropp contact and I won't see my niece again or my future niece or nephew.\n(A is pregnant and they are waiting till birth for gender)\n\nSo would I be the ass hole if I told A she does the same thing to me? \nAnd if not, should I wait to after the birth or before.",
