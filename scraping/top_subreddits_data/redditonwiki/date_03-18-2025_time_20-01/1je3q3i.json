                                    "body": "May I introduce my cousin, Richard the Monster (real name because fuck you, Richard, eat shit, and enjoy hell). This guy knocked up his girlfriend in high school. Families convinced them to marry (she was goriveous, and he was popular, too so not much convincing needed). They ended up with 2 kids. Then with a grandkid. He spent literally every moment with his granddaughter (who I\u2019m super close to). They had custody of her because their oldest was an alcoholic\u2014not a functioning one, either. Seems perfect. Except for one little thing: he\u2019d been cheating on his wife for over 20 years with the same woman. His wife had been told by many of us over the years, including myself and my parents. \n\nWe saw them. We were on a carriage ride for my 12th birthday, and some asshole pulls up next to us yelling about rich people, and stupid kids, blah blah blah. I look, and it\u2019s HIM! And his side-whore. I tell my parents who disbelieve me at first, but then realized I was right. Dad turned and yelled \u201cHi, Richard, AND HI RICHARD\u2019S MISTRESS!\u201d As loud as he could on a crowded downtown street.\n\nThe final straw for his wife came when their youngest daughter (who knew, but just didn\u2019t bother anymore mentioning it) saw him and Sidechick out and about. She stopped to say hi to her dad and his girlfriend, and he pretended he didn\u2019t know her and left her standing there. She was 15. She came home sobbing to her mother who promptly threw him out. \n\nHe died in a wreck 3yrs later\u2026a week after buying a sports car. He also never spoke to his granddaughter\u2014who he spent every day with for 10 years\u2014ever again once his wife tossed him out. For that alone he was a POS. He put the girlfriend on his life insurance when he got it 10 years before he died, and as beneficiary of his personal accounts, which he\u2019d been hiding money from his wife in just in case she left him. They\u2019d been cheating for 28 of the 40 years he\u2019d been married. His girlfriend (and he) were in their 60s. She spent her entire life waiting for him to leave his wife for her, never having kids, never making friends with anyone who knew him or his wife in any way, having to drop people at a moment\u2019s notice when he could sneak out to see her. And she will now die as nothing but the homewrecking skank of a cheating bastard because he never married her, either. I hope he\u2019s rotting in hell. \n\nBut yeah, people can be absolutely awful, and you\u2019d be surprised how much actual shit gets swept under the rug. Or never spoken of because it hurts too much. I also believe the church story because I was in a church like that, and it\u2019s easy to do something like this when you know where you\u2019re going and what you\u2019re doing.",

One day they're all at the wife's parents' house and one of the daughters mentions her brother. The parents say \"you don't have a brother!\"  to which she responds \"yes I do, he lives in Milan\". They're divorced now.\n\nThe same guy also had an affair with his own sister-in-law. She was in a vulnerable state because she'd discovered that her husband was somehow (probably gambling debts) under the thumb of the Mafia (he had been picking up bribes, committing insurance and real estate and banking fraud, stealing from her business, scamming friends into contributing for nonexistent organ transplants for their kids, etc.) and she'd just kicked him out. The brother-in-law (who lived next door) started coming over in the evenings offering his sympathy and advice on how to deal with it and ... a few weeks later he was in her pants. A real peach.",

The daughters were told by the grandparents who knew about the affair and supported their cheating son. They harassed OP and the girls, suing for grandparents rights, and moving out of the assisted living facility OP was paying for to fight for custody of the affair babies. They wanted the granddaughters to live with them and provide free child care. Grandparents lost all the legal stuff and demanded to move in with OP since they couldn\u2019t get back into the assisted living place. OP told them to FO. There was no harassment by church folks and OP was the beneficiary of everything.",

My advisor said spouses are required by law to be at least half beneficiary. So if it was true and he made them beneficiaries before he was married, the parents would try to sue for custody because the kids are entitled to the money no matter who it was left to and would probably get some of it if they went to court.",
