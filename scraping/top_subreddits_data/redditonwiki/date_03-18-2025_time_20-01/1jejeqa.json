They need work to do to keep them busy, and they will drive you up the wall if you don\u2019t provide it. I know puppies are adorable, but they grow up into dogs, and if you aren\u2019t consistent with training and investing time, you have screwed yourself.",

Crates aren\u2019t cruel and it\u2019s often important to crate train your dogs in case they need to be emergency kenneled or like if they get injured and you have to keep them from doing anything after surgery. It also sounds like the dog is bored and doesn\u2019t get enough mental and physical stimulation. I have a husky mix so I am very aware of what an anxious, high energy puppy is like. Training them to be somewhat independent and making sure they get enough stimulation is very important!! Otherwise they develop separation anxiety and destructive habits. And GSDs are not great first time dog owner dogs because of their high energy levels and behavioral needs.",

GSD are high energy and walks are not enough stimulation, dog needs training, work and loads of exercise.  Husband not willing to participate then he pays. Now 12 year old with too much kid energy plays ball with puppy until 12 arm is almost ready to fall off, then brushes and feeds puppy.  Even a 6 year old can play ball, you want to wear the puppy out.  Decide on what is best for you and what is best for the dog. Husband no longer has an opinion, that being said once you have some training done with the dog it will be easier to live with than husband.",

I've had quite a few over my lifetime and multiple dogs at a time in general, and I had one that was a problem, but nothing to this extent. \n\nIf your dog is a problem, you need to exercise it.  You,  12 year old,  and husband need to walk that dog multiple times a day if you do not have a large yard. You need to work its brain. Get it puzzle feeders for treats and a feeder ball. Get a chore/care chart for the dog. Or rehome it.\n\nThe husband needs to delete the game and step the f up. He's the one that wanted the damn thing he needs to care for it, or he needs to take the dog and leave. You say he's autistic. It's been my experience that people with autism trend to know their limits my 7 year old autistic kid can listen to everything it takes to raise a pet and decide that it's not for him. Same with sports, and he can verbalize when he has stress about something. So why can't this grown ass man?",
