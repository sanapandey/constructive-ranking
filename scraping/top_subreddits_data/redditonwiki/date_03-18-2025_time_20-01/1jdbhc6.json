If they're not the DIY-expert in the household they will direct you to the person in the household who is. \n\n2) don't ask to borrow tools, but rather ask if you could bring your materials to them and have them use the tools on it. E.g., if he needs to use the tile saw, he needs to bring his tiles over and let OOP cut them for him. \n\n3) never offer alcohol as a payment. Too many people are comfortable with this nowadays sadly, but in reality, many people are teetotallers, or allergic to alcohol, or recovering alcoholics, or simply have a very different taste in alcohol. Offer cash, or something that is usually more universally liked and does not come across as gendered or too informal/personal. For instance, invite them to lunch or dinner in your house or at a restaurant.\n\nBeyond that, OOP has every right to shut down the neighbor for being rude to her and for making weird assumptions.

If a new tool catches my eye and can be used for an upcoming project, I'm getting it. I love tools \ud83d\ude01 My dream gift is a diesel Cat backhoe someday. \n\nIf a neighbor asks to use my tool, I'll usually let them use it. USUALLY. It depends on the price of the tool and how much I trust them to get the tool back fairly quickly after their project is done, their experience level, the price of the tool and their financial ability to replace the tool or associated item like the saw blades, fuel or special oil, if they break it/ wear it out. Sometimes I'll lend it out without a 2nd thought, knowing their track record, other times I'll simply say \"sorry, it's a brand new gift and I haven't used it myself so I don't want to lend it out.\" Or I'll mention that the gasket is leaking oil (my chain saw), and it's not safe to use. If they offer to replace the gasket or part as \"payment\" for using the tool, I'll let them borrow it. \n\nHOWEVER, I have a notebook for signing-out my tools. I mark down the date, the state the tool is in at the time, the dollar value to REPLACE the tool (I don't care how old and used it is, if you break it, I want it replaced) the name/ size of the tool, how many batteries and size of batteries/ charger, extension cord, if my generator is borrowed (fuel level), the date of expected return and a space for the borrower's signature on the date it's taken and the date of return and their phone #. \n\nIf weeks have gone by and it hasn't been returned, I'll call about it and ask that it be returned. If the tool comes back damaged, missing pieces, or out of fuel, I'll ask for the money or items for replacements. I've been gracious enough to lend my tools, but I am not funding their mission, cleaning up what they've used, or going to be responsible for taking a trip to replace what they've broken or lost. If they are jerks about it, they'll never borrow another item from me again, and I'll make sure to tell other neighbors not to trust them with their tools, too.",

Boyfriend, knowing what kind of trouble this guy was getting himself into, quickly pointed out that I was the one shopping, then I asked some questions. Associate looked at me, then back to my bf and started answering my questions TO MY BF. Bf responded that he should really answer to me, and I can't remember much of the conversation other than it ended when the associate told bf that the one thing he should make sure to do when using the saw was wear ear plugs, mostly because obviously \u2014 \"you know how girls are...\" \u2014 I'd come in and yap yap yap and then next thing he'd know, my boyfriend would be missing a finger, at which time I yelled \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!\"\n\nAnyway, we left and I called the store to complain. The female receptionist asked what it was regarding, and I said I needed to talk to a manager about a male associate demeaning me. She just laughed and said \"h yeah. Can do.\" As we were walking back through Sears to get to the car an hour or so later (mostly due to my self righteous desire to see if anything happened), the guy was being escorted out.\n\nIn the end, I thanked them and went with a Dremel instead with all of the attachments. It just broke down this fall after moving across the country a few times with me, so it was probably way better than a table saw.

Maybe his buddy stores tools there because he doesn't own a garage, maybe he inherited from Grandpa and will be selling them soon. Maybe they have a roommate. Maybe they belong to the girlfriend.\n\nOnce you say hi, then you casually mention that you might pop by later and ask for some Youtube recs or  to borrow a tool. You don't mention the most expensive tools in the place straight up. You don't make the ask your first visit, either. Not directly. You just mention you might do it in the future and gauge the reaction. Recoil or uncomfortable smile? Nah. Not happening. Better invite for a casual beer first.",

That is not abnormal. That is not rude. That is a natural course of conversation as typically men have more in common with men and women have more in common with women. It also says that her significant other was going along with the conversation, which would lead the man to believe that the significant other was the trade.  Nowhere in here does it say that he didn\u2019t introduce himself, that he was rude, that he did anything wrong, all he did was assume the husband Was the craft person. Nothing in this says that he completely ignored her the entire time until that comment. Where are y\u2019all getting that from? Once again\u2026 For the millionth time\u2026 She says her self that her way of acting was snarky. She admits that even her significant other thought she was needlessly being an asshole. She realizes that she went too far, why is it so hard for y\u2019all too? I swear most of you must be chronically online, and have never had a conversation with real people. If there is a group of guys and a group of girls, and a new guy and girl walk up, it is normal for the man to migrate to the men\u2019s group and the women to migrate to the women\u2019s group. He said hello to her, he introduced himself to her, and then he just started having a conversation with her significant other who was acting as if he knew what he was talking about, giving the guy NO HINT that he wasn\u2019t a tradesman.
