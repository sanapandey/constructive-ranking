William Jones was like \"many words in sanskrit, greek and latin sound similar\", checked a bunch of words and proposed the theory, which turned out true. \n\nNowadays, we know a few people had the same idea beforehand (i.e. an italian merchant in the 16th hundreds and a Dutch linguist in the 17th hundreds), but he likely didn't as they weren't particularly famous.

No, they did not. \"St\u0159elec\" means \"shooter\". Person who shoots. \"Lukost\u0159elec\" is an archer, literary translated as \"bowshooter\". No knight-like title. They were not going for \"bodyguard of the tzar\".\n\nIf the Russian name was \"strelets\", then it would be an interesting theory. But they named it \"slon\".",

I don't think this is because it's a hunter, for example. Makes sense so far? To me, it seems like whoever named the pieces was trying to organize them as a military, and so used military ranks / titles. So, not necessary the bodyguard of the tzar, but maybe a \"sharpshooter\" or \"musketeer\" etc. (I don't know what pawns are called in Czech, but in many other Slavic languages they are \"infantry / conscripts\", rooks have different origins, but all seem to imply some military use either a boat or a tower).",

I think this is the main reason for those translations, or maybe the names were just invented anew when the pieces needed names instead of translated. Or maybe the they specifically saw the translation and wanted to distance themselves from religious connection. I have no idea, I'm really curious if anyone knows the answer.",

Alfil indicates only the chess piece.",

                                    "body": "I'm an Italian Native Speaker too, but most importantly I am a Linguist with a degree in Arabic.\n\nThe Italian word for standart-bearer (Alfiere) does not, in fact, come from the Arabic word for Elephant (Al Fil). Italian borrowed the Spanish word \"Alferez\", which is a junior military officer rank, which itself comes from Arabic \"Al Faris\", which means \"knight\", or \"horse rider\" (not in the sense of knighthood in our European point of view, but as opposed to simple foot soldier). The Arabs gave the word to the Spanish, which gave it to us. We just call the Chess Piece \"knight\" (which is interesting because we already have a piece called \"horse\") rather than \"Elephant\", and it's unclear whether we chose to call it Alfiere because it sounded like Al Fil, or if the two are entirely unrelated. What IS sure though, is that the WORD Alfiere does not come from Al-Fil.\n\nBut then again, Italian borrowed a bunch of things about chess based on assonance alone: the name \"Scacchi\" or the term \"Scacco Matto\" is another example. The \"Scacco\" is just a rendition of the Persian word \"Shah\" (King), and \"Matto\" in his case doesn't mean crazy, but dead. \"Shah Mat\" in Persian means \"The King is Dead/Defeated\". We just borrowed it without really knowing the meaning.",
