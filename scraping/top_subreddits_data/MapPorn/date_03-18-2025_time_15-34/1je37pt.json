Based on this, she concludes that it is derived from a local variant of the **Kemi S\u00e1mi language**, which was previously spoken in the area. This interpretation is further supported by other place names of S\u00e1mi origin found in the region.\n\nBy comparing the name with other place names containing similar elements, Valtonen reconstructs its S\u00e1mi linguistic roots. In the dialects of northern Finland, *j\u00e4nk\u00e4* is a well-established terrain term meaning \"bog\" or \"marsh,\" while *lauttanen* (also found in names like *Kakslauttanen*) refers to a storage platform, hanging rack, or small storehouse built on a single post.\n\nFor the three elements in the first part of the name (*\u00c4teri=tsi | puteri=tsi | puoli*), Valtonen proposes an interpretation based on a **S\u00e1mi patronymic name**: */adderid\u017ei pjedarid\u017ei puo\ua7b7eli/*, which translates to \"Puavali, son of Pjotari, son of Adderi.\"\n\nThus, the full meaning of the name would be: **\"Puavali, son of Pjotari, son of Adderi\u2019s Lauttasj\u00e4nk\u00e4 (bog with a storage platform).\"**\n\nSource: Wikipedia",
