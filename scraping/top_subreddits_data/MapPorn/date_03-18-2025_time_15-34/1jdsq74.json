My exams where at a higher level, and after my high school I did a study where I got an even higher degree English exam (because I liked the teacher and was like why not try it. I don't need to pass it but if I do that's kinda nice to have something extra)",

Genuinely curious.\n\nEdit: And actually, even if it did work, English is the _most_ studied language? Seems a bit sus. There are more Singaporeans who already get by fine in day to day life speaking Singlish but are still motivated to study English again on Duolingo, than people simply wanting to learn another language?",

What kind of irks me is when I got to the store and see groceries labelled in English despite it being a Swedish product made in Sweden. I know this is probably because they are also being sold in other countries but at the same time it feels like society is slowly getting rid of the Swedish language. Obviously it's not gone but currently there is a reading crisis with the newer generations having worse reading skills and their language skills are therefore deteriorating. This is being combated with campaigns aimed at sparking interest in reading so hopefully the trend reverses but I think it would be useful if labels still retained Swedish so that it's not only in books the language can be found. Of course the majority of labelling is still in Swedish, but more items has it in English these days than it used to be. \n\nMyself I am not learning Spanish, preferisco l'italiano.",

Practically everyone (in the cities, at least) is fluent, save for a handful of older people and very young children. I would estimate 95-99% of the people learning English on Duolingo in those countries are immigrants. Even then, they don't really need it (because why pick up English when you really only need Norwegian in Norway unless you're interacting with a tourist?).\n\nWhy Spanish specifically? [Northern Europeans love going to Spain](https://landgeist.com/2022/06/14/europeans-travelling-abroad/) (because it's warm even during the bitter Scandinavian winter) and [Spanish people don't speak English nearly as much as the rest of Western Europe](https://www.vox.com/2014/6/11/5799678/map-where-europeans-speak-english). Thus, if you want to go to Spain and be able to order food and ask for directions and whatnot without much friction, you'll do a little bit of Duolingo to get a hang of the language.\n\nDuolingo, in its casual and game-ified nature, is very popular for people who only want to learn bits and pieces of a language to \"get by\" for a vacation or similar. Someone who wants to properly learn a language start to finish for immigration or academic purposes will often search for more academic routes such as a formal course (whether in person or online) or a book/textbook.",
