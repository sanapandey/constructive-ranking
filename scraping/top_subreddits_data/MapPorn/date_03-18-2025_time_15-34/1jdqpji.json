Lol!! Ethiopia de facto reccognize them and half the continent plus several Middle Eastern nations have quasi-diplomatic relations with Somaliland .That also includes the EU now. \n\nSo which enemies are you referring to??? Because the only one that would protest is Somalia, which is not in a position to do anything. Everyone else would recognize and move on",

In 1794, the Navy was established to fight the Barbary Pirates in North Africa who were harassing U.S. ships, taking captives and demanding tribute.\n\nTo build on that, protecting maritime travel does benefit the U.S. Allowing rampant piracy  and attacks means decreased trade and higher prices. For instance, what was $4k per container to ship is now $16k+. Ships now take a 10,000 mile detour around Africa. The U.S. which has always relied on trade as a major economic driver, must defend \"Rights of Passage\", especially of U.S. and U.S. allies' flagged vessels.",

From its perspective, fixing the damn problem means destroying Israel. Therefore, even if you assume that they do not have the ability to destroy Israel, giving them up will not help any more than Ukraine giving up Crimea. Hezbollah agreed to stop the war it started only because of the Israeli attack on it, and now, with its weakening, the Lebanese army has more of an opportunity to govern Lebanon and more of a chance for peace with Israel. Now Israeli citizens are less in danger from Hezbollah. The 2022 maritime border agreement between Israel and Lebanon, on the other hand, did not avert war.\n\nThe example of the PKK shows that it is more complex.

That's no solution. The only way would be by talking. Both sides will have to sit and discuss their issues even if they hate each other.\n\nHezbollah's declared goal makes no difference. It's a target, that's it. Goals/Targets change over time when the situation changes.

You can reject and accept a claim all you want but it ain't going to change the fact that the other side thinks it's legitimate.\n\nYou saying Israel has no issues with Iran is wrong as Iran can also say that. They have no issue with Israel if Israel stops harming Palestine and its expansion into Palestine lands. Both sides can use the same argument.\n\nWonder why Iran's post-revolution ended your so-called peace deals. Cause they claimed that Palestine needed defending against Israel and they were no longer willing to stand around doing nothing. You could say that Iran started caring post-revolution about the issue and the previous government did not. maybe the population did care about the issue before the revolution. You're also forgetting the Iraq Iran relations back then were not good and ultimately resulted in a war which would be a more immediate concern for Iran. There are too many factors at play which results in hostile relations. trying to simplify them means making light of the issues.\n\nWe don't assume only one side is hell-bent as it's from the view of one side. We assume both sides are hell-bent on destroying each other once we look from both sides. You still have to talk regardless. Before, during and after the war ends, you talk. Fighting has given what? Only postponing the resuming of wars to the future.\n\nWho said concessions? Both sides talk and strike a deal where each side gets something fair. A concession is when you give up something for no benefit.\n\nFor you, they are cultural and educational issues. For them, they will say they are educated and have a culture of solidarity with people who are being punished every day. On top of using education and culture as a way to say that they are the issue means you are talking about being superior to them. Saying such things is a way to create tensions only and done in bad faith.\n\nSomething else has never been tried. The issue has always been delayed for the future. Saying ending a war means peace is brought back is a joke. The issues remain and will raise tensions slowly until they boil over again. That's the reason this issue has not been resolved. Fighting and saying we won on getting a treaty did absolutely nothing. Everyday violence still continued.\n\nYour solution is to keep fighting. I will tell you how your solution must work to produce an end to the hostile relations forever instead of delaying it. You first kill all the men as they will rise up and attack and defend each other. Then you kill women who are protecting the children as they will tell the kids about how evil the other side is and educate them on how they must rise up against the other side. Only then do you kill the children as if you don't do that, the children will grow up doing the same thing as previous adults.  \nDon't like this, too bad, that's the only way you will win with your idea of keep fighting unless you're willing to talk and do something like what happened to Germany post World War 2 as you're doing the post world war 1 treatment instead.\n\nWe have seen 70+ years of conflict and hate for this issue and your solution to keep fighting has done nothing except delay the issue for another year. WW2 ended in just 6 years. Your solution will never work unless you are willing to kill every person off regardless of what they think as you cannot risk the hate appearing again down the line. You end the war and start doing something good like done with Germany.",

It is, by the way, a dictatorship, and many of those who opposed the previous regime did not intend for Iran to become a theocracy.\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, what does Iran's excuse and the reasons for this matter as long as it stems from something Israel did to it? You are essentially suggesting that Israel give up its security for a peace that Iran will breach without Israel doing anything to it. If so, what is the point of all the discussion you are proposing if it only risks returning us to the starting point? How is this a long-term solution?\n\nYou are proposing a concession. Israel is simply demanding that they stop attacking it, threatening it, and working to destroy it. Hezbollah demands that Israel withdraw from areas south of the Blue Line, which is recognized as the international border with Lebanon - this is a ceding of Israeli territory. They also demand that Israel stop fighting Hamas - which endangers the residents of the south until October 7th and also abandons the hostages. In other words, Israel receives no benefit for its security other than a promise of peace from a terrorist organization.\n\nTalking is good; Giving in to an enemy that is committed to your destruction is usually bad. You should listen to Japan - when it surrenders.\n\nThose who educate to kidnap babies and kill civilians on purpose live in a broken culture, no matter how they feel about it. Don't you agree?\n\n\"There are still tensions\" cannot be accepted as an excuse. Otherwise, any warmongering body will refuse to give up excessive demands and start a war, and then say it is because there are still tensions. This is what Hamas did in 2023.\n\nGermany and Japan surrendered before they were rehabilitated. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam surrendered. The PKK surrendered. The second intifada is over.  \nHamas may not surrender (depending on how much they love life), but the idea that talking to them and Israeli concessions will help is unfounded wishful thinking. They had a lot to lose when they chose to try to \"purify it of Zionist filth\" and \"protect Al-Aqsa.\" They still have a lot to lose. The problem is that good living conditions are not their top priority. The Yemenis have something to lose, as do the Lebanese.

Nobody gives a crap when Khmer rogue did genocide, same with the afghan war of the soviet union, and the Korean war.

Would anyone care if people understood that the cold war was about influence and power instead of some sort of making it look like good vs evil? People join wars by being exploited(Need to put food on the table, have loans, need education, cant figure out life etc) so correctness never matters.\n\nThus using correctness never mattered. Its all about having public support so that the rich can be richer and powerful people become more powerful.\n\nRegarding saying Iran does not want Israel, I have to say, will Iran and any other nation saying death to Israel if the Palestine were not being punished in their eyes which is the fundamental issue causing the whole conflict. We have to ask this question because the whole conflict started once Palestine people started being displaced and Israel came to being. Jews, Christians, and Muslims all lived in the same place. Yes there was tensions and unrest but that's similar to what happens in USA where black and white people have tensions and periods of unrest as well. The scale of tensions would be considerably less.\n\nYou cannot say Iran will breach any deal in the same manner anyone can say Israel will breach the deal. How are you certain? If the peace is flawed by pushing the issue into the future then, your not getting any real deal. The peace deal will only occur when the fundamental issues are resolved which I have been repeating. No deal will last if you ignore the elephant in the room.\n\nIsrael wants no aggression from any other nation which they think other nations do. These nations see Israel harming Palestine people by being injust to them causing harm to them in there eyes. This is the fundamental issue. There is no other fundamental issue except this. All other requests have zero value compared to this issue so why not start with this.\n\nOnce this issue gets resolved first, all other issues become worthless for both sides as populations are happy. Isreal gets the peace. Palestine people receive justice/peace. Any claims about needing to defend Palestine or to strike other countries to defend themselves are no longer applicable once you do this.\n\nYour idea is that once you win the war, peace will prevail which is your solution. when will you win the conflict? When every person in the whole middle east is dead as no one left to hate each other? This path has been tried so many times and has not once resolved anything except delaying the issue. Why do you want this issue to continue even 10-40 years down the line by using the same methods as before has never given a good result? There is no plan to make anyone surrender because that's not the plan. The plan is to keep the tensions high to stay rich and powerful.\n\nContinued in second comment.",

War never has morals in it or a place for it so adding morals to it is stupid and making it something romantic. It will never matter how you carry it out. both sides will do whatever they want to try to win the war. There has never been a case of war where civilians were not harmed. Morality is thrown out of the window in wars. trying to add morals into a war is making it pretty by making it look like your the good guys vs the bad guys. Its about making the fool out of the people who fight in the wars.  \n  \nWill any person even join the war if the truth of war was revealed? Will people fight if they know they are fighting for some rich person to get richer or some powerful person to become even more powerful? The answer is nope cause the moment you unravel the curtains, the people will rise up against the rich and powerful. What happens in war is never acceptable cause it's ugly. Any discussion about the shit which happens in wars is trying to gain the moral high ground in a thing which never will have moral high ground. I will never be ok with any war as I see it as an ugly thing where you're not going to get any good thing out of it unless you are planning to handle the fundamental issues.\n\nFirst, we have to try a proper peace deal with the fundamental issues resolved. Give it a try and see how tensions are reduced. If tensions are reduced and opinions start to change then it means, you are now doing something correctly unlike by fighting where you're never going to improve opinions.\n\nUsing empty or veiled threats will never work. Saying that threatening Al-Aqsa will make them think twice will do absolutely nothing and doing such things gives you no benefit except to raise tensions. You're just going to raise tensions for no reason as you know you're not going to do it. This stuff is about creating a rise against others and then acting like how these people lack morals. What is a person in Yemen, Lebanon going to lose? Their life? That's nothing considering they think it's for a good cause and their death will inspire others. \n\nFor peace, you need to stop all such things. You have to handle the fundamental issue and also stop caring about who won. Why try make it some sort of race? Its done to make the population think they won something when they won absolutely nothing except delaying the issue.",

According to Max Weber's definition, a state is a community that successfully claims a monopoly over violence within a geographical area. Hamas had exclusive control over the Gaza Strip and therefore had a de facto state there. Its monopoly ended at the borders of Israel and Egypt, which are free to rule their territories.\n\nIsrael had no effective control, it did not control the health and education systems, or the taxes or the police or the weapons or the construction of tunnels or the hostages, etc. Control over the borders is not a condition for a state, Lesotho is no less independent than Gaza. Israel and Egypt do not have to sacrifice their sovereignty over their territories so that their neighbor can be independent.\n\nThe fact that Israel today controls parts of Gaza does not cancel the border, just as a Syrian who entered America today without permission is presenting a border, despite American control over parts of it. Hamas entered Israeli territory and it does not depend on the independence of Palestine.\n\nCan you substantiate your claim without appealing to authority?

Israel controls the borders and the coast and the airspace. And, as I\u2019m sure you know, the IDF makes frequent incursions into Gaza to kill and bomb people and infrastructure, as they famously did in 2008-9, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2021, killing thousands of civilians.

If the international community does not recognize Taiwan's independence, it does not cancel its statehood. The same with Gaza. For the purpose of our discussion, I prefer a definition that has physical characteristics and moral and strategic implications. For example, if Hamas has an army and police force of tens of thousands of operatives there and Israel cannot say that Israel controls the Strip. Why does control of everything that went in or out of the strip mean control over the state?\n\nIsrael did not leave Hamas to control the Strip, Hamas was elected in 2006 and took control of the Strip itself by 2007. Since then, no one has been able to remove Hamas, at least without a war like the current one. All those battles of 2008-9, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2021 were battles against Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Some of them briefly controlled small areas on the edge of the Strip, but Hamas still controlled the rest. Such battles do not nullify the independence of a state, otherwise Russia and Ukraine would not be independent today, and Israel would not have been independent on October 7, which is absurd.\n\nIsrael knew that the Palestinians were smuggling ammunition into Gaza (see for example \"Karine A\"), why would Israel allow a terrorist state to have an airport during an intifada or under its control?",
