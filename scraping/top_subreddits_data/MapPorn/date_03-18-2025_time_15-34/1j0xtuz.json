I will be using a Google Forms about the cardinal direction where you think each state lands in your opinion, so for example, is the state of Nebraska in the West, East, North, or South of the map of the USA and then I will create a map after a few weeks to a month out and get as much information and opinion on where you guys think each state lands? I will leave the link to the sheet here! Thank you! [https://forms.gle/qH2rB3JwmYoAznzP8](https://forms.gle/qH2rB3JwmYoAznzP8)",

Based on this measure, was Planet Earth 80 times larger back then? How would that map out (excuse the pun) on a world map?",
