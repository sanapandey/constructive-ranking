This is the highest among OECD countries and one of the countries with the highest population density in the world. In particular, the metropolitan area (Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi-do) has a population of over 26 million people in an area of \u200b\u200bless than 12,000km2.\n\nBut the most surprising thing is this. south korea(Especially in Seoul) definitely incredibly super dense, yet way less crowded than the foreign countries or big cites. I've even seen many people say that Seoul itself is not crowded at all. South Korea and Seoul are probably the most notable places that are this uncrowded despite their extremely high population density.",
