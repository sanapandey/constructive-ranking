In a way that means poorest between the richest, or poorest in the club of the richest nations in the world so to say.    Bulgaria still is a developed, high-income economy nowadays.    It was finally classified as that just last year.  Economic wise things are good if you compare it to the rest of the world, the thing is that people expect jt to be on the same level as Germany, France etc... That's what Bulgarians aim for, hence you'd always see negative comments on such topics",
