Add in some extra parties, Dems get 15%, Reps get 10%, and then 10 other parties split the remaining 75% of the vote, all getting 8% or lower. The House then gets to pick the president out of the top 3 choices, and with gerrymandering and party loyalty the Republicans win because it\u2019s one vote per state not one vote per House member. Hands down the Republicans win that situation. Even if one state leads to a draw with only 2 parties but no one getting the absolute majority the Republicans win the presidency.

The electoral college prevented the southern states from coming together, making a mockery of the election and effect the overall outcome. Lincoln already had less than 40% of the vote. Not crazy to think that southern states could have stuff the boxes and swing the election.",

Thiel doesn't have much on the books aside from wanting to take over the world because he thinks there's inferior people he himself can make better decisions than, but doesn't have much in the ways of argument for superior people like H man or musk did.\n\nTrump already has predisposition to complying with their views because he doesn't care about people, loves the attention and money, and this is the easiest grift. Trump even thinks musk is kind of batshit but won't fight it because of the perks.\n\nMusk and thiel's families are directly and indirectly responsible for deliberately and negligently killing tens of thousands of people without being a world leader. They both also fund the german far right party that literally quotes mein kampf and other nazi documents at rallies.\n\n\nIdk dude",

All the campaigning would be in the big cities NY, LA, Chicago, Houston, etc. The people in rural areas throughout the country would be completely left out. The electoral college ensures that all the states have a say, not just the states with the biggest cities. Not to mention, the electoral college IS actually represented by the population. Ever heard of electors? The most populous states have the most electors. Smaller states obviously have much fewer. And wrong about the Senate. Every state is represented equally the way it was designed, and it should be. And it is in the house where the population determines how the seats are represented.",
