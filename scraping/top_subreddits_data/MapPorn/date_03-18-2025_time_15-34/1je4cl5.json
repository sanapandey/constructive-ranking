From the 16th century, the nobility becomes synonymous with Hungarianness. The Romanian nobles who continued and participated in power broke away from their mass of their people, whom they ceased to represent.[174]\n\n\n\njust so people see the type of bullshit Hungarians genuinely believe and unironically type",

This religious stuff might seem to be some kind of hate directed against Romanians specifically (since that's what Romanians like to claim), but you know what catholic Hungarians did to their own pagan brethren?... As I said, it was about religion and status. The fact that Romanians were mostly serfs and mostly orthodox christians point towards their foreign origin, as cyrillic was created in the 9-10th century, when Hungarians conquered the Carpathians, and the Schism happened after Hungary as a state already declared their stance with Rome.",
