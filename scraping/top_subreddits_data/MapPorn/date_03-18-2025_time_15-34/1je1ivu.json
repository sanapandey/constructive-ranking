Immigrants from Burkina Faso and Mali long outnumber the natives of Eastern Ivory Coast and because of Ivory Coast being wealthier, the Madinka, one of the largest ethnic groups in Mali AND Northern Ivory Coast have moved there en masse.  \nI often like to highlight that at independence(before mass migration occured)Ivory Coast was only 6% Muslim. That number is now around 36% .It is not like the natives switched from Christianity(which was well established in Ivory Coast .In fact, one of the largest catholic cathedrals is there) to Islam.  Hence my estimate for Ivory Coast being around 24-30%.   \nHeck, they had a civil war over this!  \nKenya too. I estimate like 1.4 of the 3 million Somalis(The original Somalis have never been that many historically) there are refugees and recent migrants given that the current president has basically flung open that border and also migration from the rest of East Africa has been heavy, especially from Uganda and Burundi. \n\nThe way Kenyans have agents taking them to be domestic workers in KSA, UAE and Qatar, there are agents in Rwanda and Burundi taking workers to Kenya.\n\nSouth Sudan got a heavy influx of Darfurians recently though this is going to be a major issue for them now that South Sudan itself is about to descend into the second South Sudanese civil war.",

Yes, they might say individuals are coming on boats illegally, but they fail to give the flights, hiding in trucks or cars, channel tunnels,   false passports and one of the largest sources is overstayers, usually on tourist visas, work visas or coming to do education courses etc. adding to that the number of false colleges is worrying here.  Usually, such numbers are classed as that form of entry. They fail to recognise that they have entered a deceitful matter or done illegally in several cases. \n\nI used to work on crime reduction initiatives in the UK. I've seen how the government fudged figures and noticed they are still doing it to this day. \n\nI'll give one quick example, they started to fail to arrest people under \u00a3200 committing shoplifting, this was not to help the public bring down crime,  it was just to cut the crime figures because they picked one of the most common crimes committed and usually comminted by repeat offenders so therefore giving them a few excuses not to get charged and not to be on the crime figures so what they could do is present to the public and MPs as crime is lower and they are brought down the crime numbers overall, but in truth all they have done is failed to arrest people committing crimes.  \n\n Also, adding this trend of people coming from all nations rising by 16% last year alone in the UK, this percentage is rising year on year. The 2021 Census shows 1.1 million just in from Africa alone, which is well under the true numbers, as you have to add around 15-20 % shown by the general public to fill out census figures for multiple reasons.\nIt's hard to say if they are illegal figures or legal. As you stated, in the UK, MPS won't know or are refusing to give the true amount many times. Yes, they might say individuals figure on boats illegally, but they fail to give the flights, hiding, trucks or cars, false passports and one of the largest sources is overstayers, usually on tourist visas, work visas or coming to do education courses etc. adding to that the number of false colleges is worrying here.",

This is another reason why nations under one unified belief system and set of laws stopped infighting a great deal less around the globe.\n A great example of this was China, which was first united under a single state by  Qin Shi Huang around 221 BC.",
