During the 2000\u2019s, the economy contracted by nearly 50%, inflation rose by over 66,000%, and by 2005, life expectancy had fallen from 59 years in 1980 to 45 years. By 2009, the country, which had been a net agricultural exporter at independence, had 75% of its population reliant on food aid to survive. \n\nIt took until 2011 for Zimbabwe\u2019s per capita GDP to exceed the level it had been at in 1980, and the economy finally started to improve somewhat after Mugabe was deposed in 2017, though inflation is still insanely high by developed country standards.\n\nSo no, while white minority rule was obviously practically untenable and morally reprehensible, Zimbabwe was absolutely not a \u201cfailed state to begin with,\u201d or even for the first 10-15 years of its existence. It turned into a failed state because Robert Mugabe killed it.",

That's not a system that'd have survived the whiskey rebellions and the war of 1812. \n\nAfrica wasn't allowed to sort itself out into functioning nation states.

Postcolonialism aims to \"correct\" colonial stances to view the colonies as equal to the metropole (colonizer), yet some nationalist tendencies within decolonization movements view the achieving of equality only through the means of placing the colonies above the colonizer, inadvertently creating a new racial hierarchy. As the colonized is now viewed as superior to the colonizer, the rhetoric shifts to what can be called \"black supremacy\". It is, however, not a structural racism as found in \"white supremacy\" as the structural discrimination it builds is not intertwined in every power-structure, so it can most often be seen as \"everyday discrimination\". Therefore, \"black supremacy\" is not a deep rooted issue within society that influences every aspect of life, but merely a manifestation of (ethno-) nationalism within postcolonialism with different hierarchies, directly affected by colonial continuity.",

            "body": "The claim is that Rhodesians treated black people like slaves when this is largely untrue.  \nIt is VERY TRUE that systemic racism existed in Rhodesia and the economy was in many ways structured to keep the African majority at the bottom of the economic scale. but funny enough Rhodesia under Ian Smith allowed a black middle class to emerge (Unlike when British South Africa was in charge of Rhodesia and when the British directly controlled the region alongside Northern Rhodesia before Smith's UDI).  \nLife in Rhodesia was extensively covered by a lot of media(surprisingly) because I watched some of the archived footage and media from that time  \nExample is this  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt70XkU0Xk0&pp=ygUUcmhvZGVzaWEgZG9jdW1lbnRhcnk%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt70XkU0Xk0&pp=ygUUcmhvZGVzaWEgZG9jdW1lbnRhcnk%3D)  \nBy the AP  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S2NKlMW0vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S2NKlMW0vc)\n\nI believe from the BBC\n\nIn fact, the latter link will show you how working class, middle class and upper class Black Rhodesians lived . That was DEFINITELY not a slave state.  It is 100% true that because of uneven distribution of resources, blacks were denied the ability to fulfil their potential, but this is largely in line with apartheid in South Africa, not a slave state.  I believe the first link even interviews teenagers both black and white.  On the white side One is a classic racist, the rest are largely pragmatic and even seem aware of the inequality that exist in the country. On the black side, while most agreed that majority rule was inevitable, they also very much realized that if white Rhodesians left, they would end up inheriting a collapsing economy. I don't think any people in a slave state would say that.\n\nIndeed, the second link shows Rhodesia in 1976 when economically, it was shockingly better than Zimbabwe is today, for all races.\n\nIn reality, Rhodesia would have survived for much longer if it had enacted economic reforms faster as it had actually been making progress on  from 1976 onwards, to the point that many black Rhodesians willingly joined the army to fight against Mugabe. The first link covers this BTW.\n\nUnfortunately, after Zimbabwe came into being, it peaked economically in 1982, just two years after independence and after that, it kept having recession after recession with the growth periods between the two never taking the country back to where it was originally. Today Zimbabwe is an aid recipient, when Rhodesia and 1980s Zimbabwe was where the UN got its food aid to use in famine struck parts of Africa.\n\nI found this troubling because at no point should colonial conditions of a nation be better than when you get independence!",
