It\u2019s the same as the Aerondight not being anywhere near the price it actually should be canonically.\n\nIf we estimate the Hellhound as being closer to 300,000 in value (I know that\u2019s a baseless estimate but it doesn\u2019t really matter anyway) then I\u2019d say the Minotaur would be running close to 1,000,000 on the low end since we only really see the NCPD and the bigger Corps using them \n\nIt\u2019s also really hard to guess the price of anything in this game since the price of items doesn\u2019t always make sense, like top tier cyberware costing less than a lot of cars (at least as of 1.6 which I\u2019m stuck on)",

When you buy it, you\u2019re not getting a Militech show model, you\u2019re getting the equivalent of a suspiciously-cheap TV sold to you by a guy who keeps looking over his shoulder and asking if you can hurry things up. I\u2019d imagine the Hellhound originally goes to market for a cool 1-2M eddies, but it\u2019s being hawked dirt cheap to V to get it out of inventory before the cops come knocking.\n\nFor the Minotaur, I\u2019d estimate it\u2019s in a similar price range. We don\u2019t see a lot of them around, and arguably they have more complex systems than the Hellhound (articulated joints, advanced gyroscopically-stabilized robotics, targeting systems for guided projectiles, miniature power plant), so although they\u2019re smaller by mass, they\u2019re greater by complexity. The Hellhound is ultimately just an armored car with some added weaponry.",

With a proposition to privatize the force, the PD was soon after transferred to private ownership. The former chief of police was replaced by a dataterm sales executive known as Jerry Fawlter, who prioritized money above everything else.\" \n\nTaken into account technological advances, where sensors and AI are more or less commonly available (Minotaur have rather simple combat algorithms), I would say up to 500,000-600,000.\n\nIf Hellhound is going with fixer for 160,000, new bought from Mili Corpo woud be like 250,000 - 300,000 tops, around 500,000-600,000 eddies for this walking junk would be tops.

I'd have to dig in and find an accurate approximation. I'd say this thing is probably 100,000-200,000 EB/Unit, but could be as low as 20,000 if mass-manufactured by a corp like Militech, SovOil, or a mech manufacturer like Zhirafa. They're basically just robots controlled by a Daemon after all.\n\nEDIT: The EB was created to fight inflation; so prices actually came down when it took over. Beyond that; manufacturing is so advanced that robotics and weaponry are cheap to produce all-around. A 10,000 EB assault rifle in-universe is likely something truly special. In real life?
