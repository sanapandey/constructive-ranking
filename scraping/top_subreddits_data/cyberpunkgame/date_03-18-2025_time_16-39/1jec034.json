            "body": "It really is a great game.  Honestly the one thing I don't like is how they set up the plot for the two burned NUSA agents to be stranded in Dogtown for 7 years.  They are so bitter and full of anger for being abandoned.\n\nAnd yet V can just walk out of Dogtown and into Pacifica the second she needs to. And all it takes is one phone call from a fixer she barely knows.  And even before that, when we need to enter dogtown without credentials. All we need to do is walk through a hallway and a parking garage.\n\nI find it hard to believe Songbird couldn't have just broken them out the same way we got V in over that 7 year period.  Or that two of the worlds most highly trained spies couldn't figure out how to extract from what is essentially just a neighborhood.\n\nThe tension is really broken when you have to sit through a whole dialogue about how they were abandoned, left behind in this place for a third of their lives.  And then Judy just calls me for snuggles and I zip home.  Hell the wall doesn't even look very defended outside of the cross point. If it wasn't a video game with invisible walls you could just climb out of dogtown.\n\nThe game would be so much better of instead of being discarded and trapped in what they treat like a different planet with no way off world. If the agents were inserted into dogtown as sleeper agents.  Waiting to be activated. they could still feel all the resentment of how long it's been. You could have them both say. \"The operation was supposed to start 6 months after insertion. But we've been here for 7 years without contact.\"\n\nYou get all the same emotions. They can be resentful. They can be distrusting. They can be angry that their mission changed. And it would make sense why no NUSA agents like Songbird ever tried to break them out because this is still the mission. And reed is such a fucking committed to the mission soldier it makes sense as to why he never left. And his strained relationship with alex could be because she has wanted to desert for like 5 years because she believes they have been abandoned, that there is no mission.  But reed stops her, because he is mr perfect soldier.\n\nThere were so many ways to play that narrative aspect that weren't just...  There is absolutely no way out of Dogtown. And there was absolutely no way two of the worlds best spies and soldiers wouldn't have been rescued either by their agency or by themselves.  When pizza can literally be delivered.\n\nThat's some of the worst, laziest writing in video games.  Outside of that 10/10",

He's not stuck in Dogtown.  He's probably got free passage across the border, although DT strikes me as a combination of a \"worst part of town\" (so you don't go there unless you have to), and a place that NCPD has completely written off, especially since Pacifica is no longer part of NC proper.  Sort of like the Walled City of Kowloon (which was in Hong Kong.)  \n\nYou could leave DT on a permanent basis, if you had decent connections outside DT that could vouch for you long enough to establish yourself, a bit of a stretch.  On a temporary basis, probably not an issue.",
