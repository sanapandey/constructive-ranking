I think it\u2019s undeniable.  i\u2019m personally very influenced by Francis Ford Coppola and his films, as I have a degree in film and studied a lot of his movies. Apocalypse now is one of the all-time greats. And seeing Colonel Kurtz\u2019sKurtz descent into madness \u2014 there\u2019s definitely parallels. I mean, just look at the two side-by-side and tell me there isn\u2019t a physical resemblance! And as an actor, of course I\u2019m influenced by Marlon Brando. He absolutely changed the game.

I can actually empathize with everybody from both sides depending on which perspective you take.

But at the same time, he\u2019s not exactly a revolutionary; he\u2019d keep the corruption and power structures intact as long as they serve his interests.\n\nJago Szabo, on the other hand, is brutal, ruthless, and eager to seize control. If he took over, Dogtown could descend into a chaotic power struggle, or he could establish a new form of authoritarian rule\u2014one possibly even more violent than Kurt Hansen\u2019s reign.\n\nSo, I dunno\u2026 if you\u2019re looking for stability and profit, Bennett is the better choice. If you think Dogtown should remain a battleground ruled by strength, Szabo fits the bill. Either way, the city\u2019s fate would still be drenched in blood \ud83e\udd72",

I think it\u2019s pretty clear he viewed her as a valuable asset, but I think his ultimate intentions were likely more pragmatic than personal.\n\nTake for example, that Hansen knew Songbird was a high-value target, both as an elite netrunner and because of what she knew about Cynosure and Myers. So keeping her alive and parading her at the Black Sapphire wasn\u2019t just about power\u2014 I think it was also about sending a message. He had something the NUSA desperately wanted, and he was in control.\n\nBut while Hansen projects this \u201ccrush all enemies\u201d persona, I think he\u2019s a strategist first. So if he saw a way to leverage Songbird for personal gain, whether through a deal with the NUSA, selling her to the highest bidder, or using her abilities to fortify his own power, I think he def would considered it.\n\nThat said\u2026  don\u2019t think he really ever intended to let her go\u2014at least not unless he got something huge in return.  So parading Songbird in public at his casino wasn\u2019t just for show\u2014it was a psychological move. It demonstrated that she was completely under his control, reinforcing his dominance over Dogtown and making it clear to both his allies and enemies that even an asset as powerful as Songbird couldn\u2019t escape him.\n\nBut did Hansen choose her dress?? That\u2019s a really interesting question and one I\u2019ve never considered before\u2026If Hansen did choose it, it could have been a deliberate move to humiliate her\u2014stripping her of her usual netrunner attire and forcing her into something more formal, reinforcing the idea that she was a prized trophy rather than a free individual.\n\nHowever, alternatively, Songbird may have chosen it herself, playing along to bide her time or avoid further mistreatment. Given her intelligence, she might have seen it as a way to not provoke Hansen while she searched for an escape.  That\u2019s what I love about this game! You never can be too sure about anything, and you always have to be on high alert with your radar on.  What\u2019s really going on? Who can you really trust?\n\nSo I dunno. Hansen saw Songbird as useful but probably ultimately disposable. I don\u2019t have any doubt he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill her if she became a liability, but as long as she served his interests\u2014either as a bargaining chip, a weapon, or even a symbol of his power\u2014he was willing to keep her there and alive.\n\nMan, oh man, I\u2019m really going off the rails on some of these responses \ud83d\ude05 I guess I just love the game.

And the way that I would be able to contribute to the world would be in a different way. I came from a very academic family, so I definitely felt like a black sheep in a lot of ways.  So I found my footing and voiceover after trying all different acting modalities. It\u2019s just the version of the arts that suits my temperament best. I\u2019m lucky to have found it \u2014 and there\u2019s definitely actors I look up to, Idris Elba, and Keanu being two of them!\nVoice acting wise Steve Bloom was an early influence",

Video games like Cyberpunk 2077 tell these amazing stories to whole generations time and again. For me, and I'm sure many others, video games also serve as a vehicle of escapism from everyday problems and stresses.

The two of them together would turn Dogtown into a fortress\u2014where only the strong survive, and outside forces either kneel or break.\n\nBut if V collaborated with Hansen, I imagine it wouldn\u2019t be an easy alliance. He doesn\u2019t trust easily, and he respects power above all else. But if V demonstrated strength, tactical skill, and unwavering commitment, I could see Hansen seeing them as a useful asset \u2014 or even a potential right hand. \ud83d\udc40 \n\nWith V at his side, he might even push further\u2014expanding Dogtown\u2019s influence and turning it into a black market empire or even an independent state, completely outside NUSA and corporate control.

The Colonel isn\u2019t just a typical power-hungry villain dude\u2014his actions are driven by a cold, pragmatic worldview shaped by his past and the brutal realities of Dogtown. So while his methods seem ruthless, there is a warped moral reasoning behind what he does:\n\nI think Hansen believes in strength and control above all else. In a world dominated by corporate exploitation and government corruption, he sees Dogtown as a place where only the strong survive. So basically if you can\u2019t protect what you have, you don\u2019t deserve to have it.\n\nAnd from his perspective, Dogtown would collapse without his iron grip. I think Hansen sees himself as the only one capable of maintaining order in a lawless, corporate-abandoned wasteland. And to him, brutality isn\u2019t cruelty\u2014it\u2019s efficiency. If executing traitors or crushing dissent keeps the system running, then so be it.\n\nRemember, Hansen was once a high-ranking military officer, and was likely betrayed or abandoned by the NUSA. So his hatred for President Myers and the FIA seems to suggest he sees them as no better than the corpos\u2014just another faction looking to control and exploit people. In Hansen\u2019s mind, he\u2019s not the villain; he\u2019s the last man standing against government overreach.  And, from an actor\u2019s perspective, this is really fertile ground to play a villain like this. What he is doing and does is what he believes is right. \n\nBut despite his brutality, Hansen did build something out of nothing. Under his rule, Dogtown is self-sufficient, has its own black-market economy, and functions outside of corporate or governmental control. It may be a dictatorship, but it\u2019s HIS dictatorship\u2014and from that perspective, that\u2019s better than letting Dogtown fall into chaos or corporate hands.\n\nSo what I love about Hansen is that he isn\u2019t evil for the sake of being evil. He\u2019s a survivor, a warlord, and a leader who believes his way is the only way. His moral code is brutal, but still\u2026 it\u2019s a moral code. And in the world of Night City, where corporations treat people like disposable assets and governments wage endless wars, I think Hansen sees himself as the lesser evil.\n\nOkay long rant over jeeze \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",

I had previously recorded their lines and I could react from that which was super helpful! And definitely my preference.\n\nI also loved talking to everybody on the loudspeaker. That was a real highlight. Sometimes I would do a take where I would incidentally say something and one of the writers would either say I like that better and keep it, or say no we need to stick with the original script because The plot or something.

I dunno\u2026 Choosing between Songbird\u2019s path or Reed\u2019s path is tough, cuz each carry\u2019s such massive consequences. Helping Songbird escape to the moon means defying the corrupt NUSA and honoring her desperate wish for freedom. I mean, It\u2019s a powerful act of rebellion, but it comes at a massive cost\u2014Songbird has been deceitful, and even if she lives, she never actually cures V, making the whole ordeal feel like a tragic gamble to me. And this path also forces the confrontation with Reed who, despite his loyalty to the system, genuinely believes he\u2019s trying to protect her.\n\nSo siding with Reed and turning Songbird in to the NUSA offers a more pragmatic outcome, cuz it leads to a potential cure for V if Songbird is captured alive. And even tho Reed is a government agent, he really seems to care about both V and Songbird in his own way, and his path aligns with the idea of making difficult choices for long-term survival. But, this decision also means dooming Songbird to a fate worse than death\u2014being locked away and used as a tool by the very system she was trying to escape. So\u2026ultimately, the choice comes down to personal vibe: siding with Songbird means prioritizing freedom and rebellion, while choosing Reed is about survival and stability, \u2026 even if it means sacrificing someone else\u2019s dreams.  But if your Kurt Hansen, that\u2019s exactly what you want. Everything in a handbasket your way. Even if it\u2019s going to hell in said handbasket. As long as it\u2019s your way.",

Our director Pierce O\u2019Toole really has an amazing ability to do that.

Well, If Hansen had won I think he absolutely would have taken a trophy\u2014and something meaningful, like something that proved his dominance. Maybe V\u2019s jacket, their cyberware, or even their weapon\u2026 as a reminder to anyone who dared challenge him. \n\nCuz Hansen isn\u2019t just about power; he\u2019s about control, and taking something from V would cement his victory in the most personal way possible. \n\nAs for who I\u2019d have liked to voice if not Hansen, I think a high-ranking Arasaka executive would have been fascinating\u2014someone who doesn\u2019t need brute strength but can destroy lives with a single decision. That kind of cold, corporate power is just as terrifying as Hansen\u2019s brute force.  I also think it would be a lot of fun to voice V. But Gavin already defo knocked it out of the park!\n\nWhen it comes to the music, No Save Point by Run the Jewels I think really embodies the game\u2019s energy, but I have to say, Chippin\u2019 In by SAMURAI hits in a way that never gets old. There\u2019s just something about that rebellious, chaotic spirit that perfectly fits the world of Cyberpunk. \n\nAs for my V? I love a brutal, cyber-enhanced Solo build\u2014gorilla arms, melee combat, just pure, unstoppable force. But I also love playing a stealthy Netrunner, dismantling enemies from the shadows like a ghost in the system. It really depends on my mood, but one thing\u2019s for sure\u2014whatever my V is, they\u2019re built to survive \ud83e\uddbe\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude05",

Every move he makes is calculated, and he genuinely believes that his way is the only way to keep Dogtown from collapsing. He doesn\u2019t trust easily, doesn\u2019t hesitate to crush his enemies twice as quick \u2014but at the same time, there\u2019s a code he operates by. There\u2019s something almost admirable about his sheer willpower\u2014he carved out his own empire in a world where corporations and governments treat people like disposable assets.

We\u2019re friendly thru the socials \u2026 but I hope to meet them one day at a signing or something.  They did such a great job with the V\u2019s, and both extremely talented \n\nAs far as Kurt\u2019s car, he isn\u2019t just another flashy corpo boss\u2014he\u2019s a damn warlord. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019d need to flex with some luxury vehicle\u2026 his power speaks for itself. An armored AV seems like more the move for the Colonel. It\u2019s mobile, heavily fortified, and would give him the tactical advantage to strike or retreat when needed. \n\nNow that I\u2019m thinking about it tho\u2026 A classic 2020 helicopter\u2026 mmm nah too old-school. Same kinda reasoning as the aforementioned mentioned: A luxury ride like that would attract too much attention and make him too vulnerable. Just look at what happened to Pres Meyers\u2026. Not that Kurt has anyyyyy idea how that happened \ud83d\udc40 \nBut Hansen is all about control, and an AV keeps him untouchable while still commanding the battlefield. \n\nAnd the first time I knew this was gonna get Reel was the first session that I walked in too.  There were several people on the room and several more online so I knew it was something big. And then when they told me what it was for I nearly lost my mind because I was already such a huge fan at the franchise.  They told me who the character was explained to me who they thought he was, and then we started discovering more together. It\u2019s was one of the best experiences of my professional life \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc \n\nTo answer your last question (great question) I don\u2019t think Hansen would ever let Dogtown collapse without a fight. He built it as his own personal stronghold, and while he despises corpos and the NUSA, he understood the power dynamics. If Phantom Liberty never happened, I think he\u2019d play both sides\u2014using Dogtown\u2019s strategic value to pit NUSA and the corps against each other while securing his own position. He wasn\u2019t just a brute; he was a tactician. Silent protection, backdoor deals, and leveraging chaos to keep himself on top - oh and some executions along the way \u2014 That\u2019s the Kurt Hansen way.",

You answered them all flawlessly and in such depth, I really appreciate that\n\nI also love your answer toward the personal car of Kurt, very well thought out, but also I imagine he would collect lots of vehicles but just have them as an art gallery of sorts, like other infamous warlords but also in the style of that small dealership thing we saw in the Dogtown stadium. He seems to be a trophy collector but only functional so I.E special weapons from his defeated enemies but no flashy jewelry or fur coats kept lol \n\nAlso veryyyy true on the 2020 helicopters, by 2077 they are antiquated but seldomly used by Militech as a statement piece rather then true tech, you know your lore and character amazingly! \n\nAlso wow, that sounds intense to be brought on such a project like a major cyberpunk DLC!! Thank you for the vivid description \n\nAnd lastly, very eloquently worded omg. It makes sense, a person like Hansen would either die trying or become hungrier for more in all the chaos.

A low simmering cinder of intimidation\u2026 You never know when he\u2019s going to snap. I really enjoyed that from this character.",

There are some of the most intense I\u2019ve ever done. Two hours of shouting and dying and burning and being electrocuted and falling and being smashed \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nAnd yeah, the creative team was really helpful in terms of getting me the information I needed to help me understand the circumstances. Because the difference for say the Street criminal in Spider-Man and Kurt is that they\u2019re probably both the same level of bad ass, except that Kurt also has this cool and shrewd aspect to him. He knows how to speak to politicians and the elite, and he knows how to command an army. Very unusual combination. All well being able to \u201chandle business\u201c",
