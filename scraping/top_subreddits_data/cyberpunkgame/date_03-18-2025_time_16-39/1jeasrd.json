            "body": "I just did this mission a couple of nights ago, and it was very emotive. Initially when meeting Judy I could tell she was very guarded with her emotions, nerdy and very hyperfixated on BDs and their tech, she doesn't hand out her trust easily and has been burned by doing so before (you can tell by the conversation you have the next morning). During the mission, you can tell that she's really opening up to you by showing you what she shows you - she wants you to know more about her, she wants that connection. She has a ton of depth as a character, and I enjoyed doing the missions for her.",

And there are a lot of AMAZING characters in this game, but she grows and changes the most over time and you learning more about her is incredibly fun and powerful.",
