    "selftext": "As the voodoo boys have said, the blackwall in itself is an AI, and it only a question of time before it goes rough too. So the idea of becoming alleys/friends with the rough AI's isn't a stupid idea. That said tho... the question is if all the AI's behind the blackwall are evil or not. I know that some if not most want nothing more than torture people as we saw from Erebus, but... are they all like that? What do you chooms think?",

            "body": "1.) Not all rogue AIs beyond the Blackwall are evil. For example, Delamain is from beyond the Blackwall and he's pretty chill. \n\n2.) To put it simply, The Blackwall is a firewall developed by NetWatch tasked with keeping rogue AIs from breaking through into the rest of cyberspace and wreaking havoc. It splits up the old network systems in half, leading to stories of haunted data.\n\nIt's not very effective. To quote Bryce Mosley(NetWatch agent), \"*People imagine it as a great border wall, a one-time solution to protect humanity forever. Whereas it's more like a torn-open trash bag taped over a busted window.\"*  \n\nBasically a Hail Mary buy-some-time solution for the Rogue AI problem.",

Once found, the target was fried and a copy of his digitalized mind (a construct) was created and stored into the arasaka archive of night city. This soulkiller was used by kei arasaka during 4th corporate war to soulkill hostile netrunners and later to soulkill militech and USA person of interest.   \nIronically kei arasaka was the last victim of this soulkiller.\n\nThe third soulkiller was the one created by hanako arasaka basing her studies on alt original soulkiller.

                            "body": "For example, the city of Hong Kong fell victim of a bio plague and was sectioned off from the rest of the world. Alt Cunningham then moved into the ruins of Hong Kong and established the Ghost Town, a safe haven for AI that would run on all the old servers, with the majority of repair work being done by automated drones. Since it's an a location that is a\u00a0victim to a bio plague and no longer has humans, it is a perfect location for the AI, as well as the fact that entering this area would be extremely dangerous. So we can't physically walk in and disconnect from the Ghost Town.\n\nAnother way is to nuke these locations all at once or EMP them. But this has way worse consequences. It's just not a surefire way to destroy the entire net infrastructure. In all likelihood, the corporations previously residing in these cities would have built nuclear-resistant underground facilities to assure the safety of their networks, the same way Arasaka or Militech like to do in Night City. Beyond this, the new and old nets are one and the same. They are permanently connected and, therefore, suddenly shutting down or destroying a huge portion of the intricately crafted net divided by only the black wall would have unknown consequences, ones that could easily spell the end of the net itself, and even humanity if Rogue AI were to suddenly spill over. Something that the AI are already planning either way. To take down any form of their hardware would be essentially declaring war on the other side. A big reason as to why Netwatch has only ever truly tried to remove access to the old net rather than destroy it. That and the fact that there is invaluable data connected to the old net as well. Information that corporations like Netwatch, Arasaka, and Militech are still attempting to dive and retrieve even in the year of 2077. In Edgerunners, we directly see this with Arasaka's childnet-running program that would task the team to dive past the blackwall in search of any data they could scour. We also see Militech's version of this with Project Cynosure and Phantom Liberty, and No Coincidence. It is a novel in which they attempt to produce an AI with human emotion in order to act as an editor between the new and old networks. We also happen to learn the realization going on in the old net between AIs. Despite getting a hold of Hong Kong and the various infrastructure around Earth and outer space, the Arasaka executive Katsu spills the truth in No Coincidence. He states, \"In reality, these AIs have at their disposal only the limited portion of cyberspace that we ceded to them nearly 40 years ago. No new space has been created. Neither is there a backdoor. No physical connection that leads directly beyond the all-pervasive barrier that is the black wall. If evolution has taken place, it has been determined by limited space and resources. You are afraid of war, but it has already begun among the AIs themselves. \"It is a war over scarcity.\" \"\n\nThe situation humanity and Netwatch have at their hands is extremely fragile.\u00a0\n\nThe best option really is to spend as much time as possible preparing for the collapse of the black wall and net. It would be near impossible to entirely shut down the net in the year 2077, but most they could do is what they previously did in 2023: propagate a code wave to crash the IG protocols that allow cyberdecks and net-capable computers to reach cyberspace, an option unlikely to pass a result of corporate control. Even with this, Rogue AIs could still do widespread damage, and it would only really prevent the average person from actually accessing cyberspace. Any cybernetics, infrastructure, and much more would still be at risk from the Rogue AIs.",

Rogue AIs are programs that can self program which means it can train itself to become very very very smart overtime. It's like playing chess against an AI bot with the difficulty cranked to the max then multiplied. Not even chess grandmasters would be able to beat it. \n\nBest way to deal with these Rogue AIs is to destroy the servers of the old net but it's way harder than we think. The hardware is simply unreachable. The major contributor to this issue happens to be the infamous 4th corporate war. Supply chains, and transportation infrastructure were some of the most involved collateral damage to their rivalry. A lot of these facilities, towns, and even automated factories were heavily damaged and abandoned, but still maintain power. Meaning that to access these places, they not only need to be rediscovered, but have enough equipment or manpower to get past all the destruction left behind and even possible automated defenses. These also included locations orbiting the earth that were under full automation and connection to the net. So take all these abandoned earth and orbital facilities still connected to the net, then add the DataKrash to the equation. Most of the information stored in the net was corrupted, including connections to orbital facilities as well as information on where to find all these different networks. It would make it extremely difficult to track down and disconnect every piece of the old net. \n\nThere are also too many servers that hold and run the Old Net. Netwatch already struggles to ping the locations of high skilled netrunners. So AI evolved way beyond humanity with access to all the same programs as humans, if not more, would be even more difficult to fight. They would easily be able to prevent Netwatch from just pinging the location. Many of the locations that the servers are in aren't even accessible to humans.",

Netwatch already struggles to ping the locations of high skilled netrunners. So AI evolved way beyond humanity with access to all the same programs as humans, if not more, would be even more difficult to fight. They would easily be able to prevent Netwatch from just pinging the location. Many of the locations that the servers are in aren't even accessible to humans as they're places which is heavily radiated or plagued.\n\nFor example, the city of Hong Kong fell victim of a bio plague and was sectioned off from the rest of the world. Alt Cunningham then moved into the ruins of Hong Kong and established the Ghost Town, a safe haven for AI that would run on all the old servers, with the majority of repair work being done by automated drones. Since it's an a location that is a\u00a0victim to a bio plague and no longer has humans, it is a perfect location for the AI, as well as the fact that entering this area would be extremely dangerous. So we can't physically walk in and disconnect from the Ghost Town.\n\nAnother way is to nuke these locations all at once or EMP them. But this has way worse consequences. It's just not a surefire way to destroy the entire net infrastructure. In all likelihood, the corporations previously residing in these cities would have built nuclear-resistant underground facilities to assure the safety of their networks, the same way Arasaka or Militech like to do in Night City. Beyond this, the new and old nets are one and the same. They are permanently connected and, therefore, suddenly shutting down or destroying a huge portion of the intricately crafted net divided by only the black wall would have unknown consequences, ones that could easily spell the end of the net itself, and even humanity if Rogue AI were to suddenly spill over. Something that the AI are already planning either way. To take down any form of their hardware would be essentially declaring war on the other side. A big reason as to why Netwatch has only ever truly tried to remove access to the old net rather than destroy it. That and the fact that there is invaluable data connected to the old net as well. Information that corporations like Netwatch, Arasaka, and Militech are still attempting to dive and retrieve even in the year of 2077. In Edgerunners, we directly see this with Arasaka's childnet-running program that would task the team to dive past the blackwall in search of any data they could scour. We also see Militech's version of this with Project Cynosure and Phantom Liberty, and No Coincidence. It is a novel in which they attempt to produce an AI with human emotion in order to act as an editor between the new and old networks. We also happen to learn the realization going on in the old net between AIs. Despite getting a hold of Hong Kong and the various infrastructure around Earth and outer space, the Arasaka executive Katsu spills the truth in No Coincidence. He states, \"In reality, these AIs have at their disposal only the limited portion of cyberspace that we ceded to them nearly 40 years ago. No new space has been created. Neither is there a backdoor. No physical connection that leads directly beyond the all-pervasive barrier that is the black wall. If evolution has taken place, it has been determined by limited space and resources. You are afraid of war, but it has already begun among the AIs themselves. \"It is a war over scarcity.\"\u00a0",

Sure, data in cyberspace must have a physical source in reality, but just like in real life im sure all that data doesn't need to be stored in the same place. Or it could be on some old cyberdeck buried out in the desert somewhere, or who knows what else.\n\nI believe there is examples of \"ghost data\", where secret dataforts can be found in cyberspace in places that they shouldn't exist in physical space.",

Within the bubble there smaller bubbles which would be domains of corps or whatever. The large bubble and the small bubbles are formed by computers networked together. RABIDS virus basically popped the smaller bubbles and the stuff inside leaked into the public domain. That was the Idea, but there were also the weaponized AIs. Experimental as they were they started to play war. That started to erode the big bubble. But the world was dependent on interconnection, so a complete shutdown was Impossible. Think about pullling the plug on all hospitals, fireststations and so on at once.  \nThen netwatch stepped in. The blackwall cought the rogue AIs and the rest of the world tried to catch a piece of the cyberspace. The result looks like a raspberry. A lot of seperated small bubbles sticking together and with a rotten core.  \nIn the real world the hardware is keeping this construct running.

Hell, even some creatures with far less problem-solving intelligence than humans don't care about \"winning\" as much as others.

I also imagine the blackwall isn't just some static firewall, it probably has to shift and move through different hardware constantly to contain the AI and even then it's stated it isn't perfect, so even newer stuff might have rogue AI contained within it. There's also the corpo angle to consider in that I imagine most corps are probably thinking of ways they can use the rogue AI to their benefit, so have a vested interest in not getting rid of it completely.",

Basically, there's actually different types of AI and one of them is the rather simple \"Dedicated Heuristic Controllers\", which is an AI tasked with a very specific task. \n\nThe Blackwall seems to fit this category : it was created with the very precise task of protecting the surviving Net. You could imagine that, in order to fulfill this task, it was given only specific abilities and i) cannot acquire more (ie. go rogue) or ii) doesn't want to acquire more as it wouldn't serve its primary function. \n\nYou could say that this stretches the notion of AI. The wiki itself defines AI as \"*a computer, a robot or a program that is \"self-aware\", meaning it is capable of not only logical deduction, reasoning, and speaking, but also knows of its own existence, the possibility of its own mortality (or immortality), and possesses creativity, desire, and emotion*\". Does the Blackwall possesses creativity, desire and emotion ? Maybe, but personally I think that its primary directive is so strong that it simply evolves and acts with the sole intent of fulfilling it, so a Human may never experience it.",

This drive manifests in different ways like self-preservation, sacrificing oneself for children (biological continuity), or for students and communities (cultural and intellectual continuity). In extreme cases, individuals might even sacrifice themselves for the survival of humanity itself, ensuring that human legacy, the foundation of human continuity, persist.\n\nFrom this basic drive, all emotions such as fear, love, hatred... can be derived, as well as societal structures such as hierarchies, laws, and moral codes. What is considered \"good\" or \"evil\" depends on whether something supports or threatens this fundamental goal. Even within human societies, there is constant debate over what should be prioritized: economic prosperity at the cost of sustainability, or environmental protection at the cost of economic growth? Political ideologies - capitalism, communism, conservatism, socialism - clash over differing interpretations of what is ultimately \"good\" for society.\n\nNow, if an artificial intelligence were to share this same fundamental drive, the preservation of information, it would still likely develop an entirely different moral framework, reaching vastly different conclusions on how best to achieve that goal. However, there is no guarantee that an AI would even share this fundamental drive in the first place. As a theoretically immortal entity, it might have motivations that are completely alien to us, leading to entirely different emotional states and, consequently, a morality that is unrecognizable by human standards.\n\nThus, wild AIs are not inherently \"evil\" - they simply do not conform to human moral frameworks. However, from the perspective of humanity, they may pose an existential threat, making them appear \"evil\" to us, even though they do not operate within our ethical paradigms at all.",

Others simply want to watch, maybe others would rather mess around with human life and nudge us around like insects in an atrium.\n\n  \nThey're basically just a higher form of life, there's no telling what they could do",

This obviously causes a difference in perspective and opinions amongst the AIs considering we have characters like Delamain. There is also  currently an AI named Lilith attempting to take over Night City. I think the theory is that Lilith is actually the AI that was \"summoned\" by accident by that Maelstrom cult, and is also the AI that we run into posing as Alt. Remember when speaking to \"Alt\" she mentions she isn't actually Alt, but an AI borrowing Alt's engram or personality, or something like that. I think this Lilith/Alt AI isn't necessarily evil either, but recognizes how dangerous humanity is to her, specifically, and wants to destroy all Mikoshi and Soul Killer tech at any cost. \n\nI imagine wild AIs are like spirits attempting to interact with the living, and not understanding that by doing so they destroy the living by interacting with them the wrong way. I also believe that the AI wouldn't know how to stop themselves if they all of a sudden had instant access to everything like during the Bartmoss Datakrash, and accidentally wipe out humanity simply trying to slip into and fit into the same space occupying humanity.",

The AI could immediately assess the threat that humanity poses and begin to attack instantly, moving at the speed of data through the Net. Humanity, likely Netwatch, would have to have a response set to launch as soon as there is a breach.
