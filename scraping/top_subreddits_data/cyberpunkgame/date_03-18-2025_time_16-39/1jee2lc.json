Two things immediately turn me off from an RPG/action game: floating damage numbers and the shirtless unmodified human guy eating a shotgun blast and not immediately splattering. It can be very annoying sometimes, but without it the combat is such a letdown, even with the difficulty adjustments of 2.0 every build was still OP asf by the end.",

Very hard is reasonable at this point, (level 35 or so), and I die every once in a while, which I find to be fun. I am a little concerned about the fight with Oda, and the fight with Smasher, though. \ud83d\ude05",
