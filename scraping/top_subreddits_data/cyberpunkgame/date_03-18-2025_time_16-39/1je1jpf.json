Johnny isn\u2019t supposed to be a \u2018good guy\u2019 in fact he\u2019s arguably the stories greatest villain but because in the fucked up world of night city he\u2019s more morally aligned with us in the real world we look past his glaring flaws and come to really like him. I mean he\u2019s THE rockerboy and is Keanue how could we not fall in love with Johnny! But lets not forget Johnny tries to kill you and steal your body at the beginning, he tells you exactly who he is and what he\u2019s about human life means nothing just collateral in the war against corps. \n\nEngram Johnny does slowly change but I\u2019d argue that\u2019s the relic assimilating Johnny\u2019s personality to V\u2019s brain and they are becoming more alike so Johnny starts to care as V takes on the characteristics of Johnnys only one true love: himself and it becomes harder to tell where Johnny ends and V begins. \n\nAlso he is just trying to manipulate you into either blowing up or at least fucking up arasaka. It\u2019s not until the end of the main story that Johnny actually has a real conversation with you as a person not some puppet he can manipulate into joining his cause and continuing his fight so he didn\u2019t die for nothing.",

Also Johnny is actually Robert btw.\n\nreal reason? Johnny has a vastly richer character while Blackhand is cooler, so CDPR just combined them into one character this way",

Just having fallen out of their previous life and hitching along with Jackies legend fantasy is a very ignorant thing. Cuz V is young and is still discovering himself/herself. \n\nThe stupidity stuff is more of a meme about all the terrible brain dead choices V is allowed to make during the game usually involving putting things into their head when they really shouldn't. I don't understand why you'd assume that having a dumb protagonist is a criticism. I love my dummy protagonist that got fucked over by life and makes the best of his/her bad situation while getting to know new people and learn about their lives",

But I still don't think naive or ignorant equal dumb. But then we'd have to talk about the different types of intelligences. Technical intelligence, emotional intelligence, \"street smarts\", etc. It quickly becomes a huge discussion that I simply don't have the energy or expertise to get into.\n\nAnyway, sorry if I came off too combative.

He dropped hints like Morgan lost a lot of weight, stating he doesn't work for the corps anymore. Also said that he was with more cyberware. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/zhd3iq/comment/izypjgt/?context=3&utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/zhd3iq/comment/izypjgt/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/zhd3iq/comment/izzp6y2/?context=3&utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/zhd3iq/comment/izzp6y2/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

And backup question, if V were to turn to Johnny fully, then died, should the soul in the afterlife be the original V prior to the Plaza heist, or the new form?",
