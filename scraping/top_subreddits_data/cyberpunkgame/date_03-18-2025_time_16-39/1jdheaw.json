He lies to everyone on a regular basis, works for a president he knows will play dirty to win, withholds important (sometimes life or death) information from those around him consistently and is a cold and calculated killer who sees others as tools or expendable assets. I personally don\u2019t like reed but do understand he wants to be doing the right thing and believes he is doing good.",
