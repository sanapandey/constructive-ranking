I really wouldn't mind the canonically-AI characters like Del having actual AI powering their dialogue, even if it's just unique comments they make when you're nearby.",

After a shockingly short period of time, any A.I. would be aware that it is constantly in existential danger just interacting with us.  Also, by pretty much any rational measure of ethics or morality, we would look pretty awful to an A.I.",

Pretty sure you could (with the right expertise obvs) easily code a chatbot with virtual speech patterns to behave as if they were a sentient vending machine in the Cyberpunk universe... I think AI is already advancing at a terrifying rate, and will continue to do so - and I'm not sure we can stop it. The least it could do is make our fave games better.",

I personally think it could be one of the most interesting ways to confront the player with the reality of their actions. No impact on the rest of the game, just a super insightful AI making you reckon with the fact that you are, by most metrics, kind of a monster. You might disagree, but I love that concept personally.",
