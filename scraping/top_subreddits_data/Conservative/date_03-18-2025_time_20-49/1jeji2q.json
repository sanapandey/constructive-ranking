DPF using the EGR to control regen to help reduce NOX to compile with  emmsions. ERG does cause carbon packing of ring landings and plugging of intakes. ISX15 did have issue and redesigned piston. We however have most of this understood and under control. This isn't 2004\n\n**However, STILL THE DPF is what fucks the engine over. Turning your exhaust into 1200F+ oven and washing out cylinder liners out; glazing liners is what destroying engines. Not ERG.** we are using fuel on exhaust stroke to fuel the DOC, DPF, and SCR. It Stripping lubrication from the rings and cylinder walls. Egr is just a tool DPF uses in regens\n\nI usually rebuild 1 to 3 engines in our fleet a year. Complete overhauls. It's ALWAYS FAILS LEAK TEST FROM FAILED RINGS, low compress. Then DPF can't regen with out of control outlet temp because DPF regen has trashed the liners and rings. Cause excessive soot from low compression and soot acts as a fuel for regen cycle. Then proceeds Engine shutdown on safety. \n\n\n\n\ndelete DPF will shut down said EGR. Of course fuck the DOC, Decomp tube, and SCR.\n\nDeleting the DPF is for the Normies talk. Yes delete it all and shut down the EGR>\n\n\n**Delete the DPF**\n\nI could get 500k 600k out isl9 with just \"EGR\" 2004 circa local bobtail on PTO deliver like refine fuel or propane. I'm only getting 300-450k between rebuild till they fail leak test and can't control outlet temps. Piston and ring, Bearing, Set of injectors. Back in service. Of course Head service and pin bearing are checked.\n\nDPF Kills engine. Not really EGR.",
