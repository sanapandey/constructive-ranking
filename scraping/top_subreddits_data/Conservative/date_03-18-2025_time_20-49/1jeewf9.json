This isn't an issue of morality or anything.  \n\nAbout the only way to combat it is to differentiate human rights from citizenship rights, but it's not going to matter.  Reality isn't their thing.  \n\nOn the flip side, all the irl liberals I know are also the most racist and the dumbest people I know.",
