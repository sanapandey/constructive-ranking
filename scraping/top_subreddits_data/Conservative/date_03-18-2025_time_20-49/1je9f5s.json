We have an appellate process, and each of these rulings will go through it. We DEFINITELY don't want to start a precedent of allowing no judicial recourse against executive orders.\n\nThis country doesn't turn on a dime. That's a GOOD thing.",

This is a thing people on the internet care about. Just think back to when they impeached Trump in a similar situation where they knew they couldn't convict him. It's all a bunch of junk that wastes the time of Congress when they should be focused on passing laws.\n\n> impeachment of Samuel Chase\n\nThey didn't convict him either.",

The constitution says the president can be removed after impeachment and conviction by congress not the judiciary. To use your own point - where do you see in the constitution that the judiciary has any power over the executive whatsoever? Not only is impeachment the sole way he can be removed, the president is also granted ultimate pardon authority and control over law enforcement as the chief law enforcement officer!\n\nBut you claim actually the judges are the chief? Where does it say that? Hmm from looking at the powers and reading the actual constitution it's almost like the entire point was for the judiciary to have no power over the president or anyone else other than to influence public opinion! With that in mind it's not such a big deal they are unelected and appointed for life. All of a sudden though if you want to make them the supreme authority over enforcement and not the president... then that becomes a pretty huge deal.",

No, it would be their duty to ignore an unconstitutional order AND Congress should impeach said judge under their authority (Article I, Section 2).\n\nArticle III Section 2 of the US Constitution states that judges have the power to declare **laws** unconstitutional, not the **actions** of the Executive branch to carry out those laws.  If the Executive does something unconstitutional in the execution of the laws, it is up to the Congress to impeach said Executive.\n\nOver usage of Temporary Restraining Orders by judges and shopping for activist judges, especially for lawfare purposes are much more a constitutional crisis meant to hobble administrations (both Republican and Democrat) by tying up actions in the courts for months or years at a time, obstructing the will of the people.\n\nNowhere in Judge Boasberg's ruling does he declare the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 unconstitutional, and he's had plenty of time to do so previously, as the law is over 200 years old and he's been on the bench for just over 14 years.",

Judicial review, established in Marbury v. Madison (1803 - most of the founding fathers were still active then, George Washington only died 4 years earlier), ensures executive actions comply with the Constitution. Courts don\u2019t \"control\" the country\u2014they issue rulings, which the executive can appeal.\n\nYou suggest the judiciary is unaccountable, yet federal judges are nominated by elected presidents and confirmed by the Senate. You also imply the executive should be able to ignore judicial rulings, which would dismantle the rule of law. The alternative to judicial oversight is unchecked executive power\u2014far more dangerous to constitutional governance. The system is slow by design to prevent rash, unilateral actions.

Rule by unelected judges who declare themselves kings.\n\n> You suggest the judiciary is unaccountable\n\nNo I didn't. I said they are unelected and thus the furthest from the people. The president is the only member of government elected by the entire country yet apparently you think an unelected district judge has and should have more power. You substitute what you call unchecked executive power with unchecked judicial power which is far more dangerous.\n\nIn reality the check on the president's power isn't to make him an employee of the judiciary like you claim he is. It's through impeachment from the body that is closest to and represents the the people, which is congress. And also his term limit and the upcoming elections for his position. \n\nIt's ridiculous that your example of judges being \"accountable\" is that they are appointed for life. They are far less accountable to the people than the president is but you think they should have ultimate authority over him. Insane.\n\n> I can't even figure out what you think judges are supposed to do?\n\nInterpret the law in an unbiased, logical, and objective manner. They are advisors to the executive and the public nothing more. If they abuse their power they lose their legitimacy in the court of public opinion and that's what we're seeing. Then they become powerless. All their power is in public opinion. Objectively that is why as a matter of fact they have no enforcement mechanism. It's by design.\n\nTo use your own words, you may find that frustrating, but it\u2019s what prevents the judiciary (and thus the country under its rule) from becoming authoritarian.",

But also he is throwing the gauntlet that he will not support having SCOTUS interferring, either overturning these decisions or issuing a writ of mandabus.\n\nFor the record, impeachment is the 1st step in punitive action, congresses version of a Grand Jury. so an impeachment is vote of no confidence or a bases of crime has been committed, and prosecution is warranted.\n\nWith impeachment in hand, the Senate can choose to conduct a \"trial\", declare guilty or not, and what punishment may occur:\n\n**The United States Constitution provides that the House of Representatives \"shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\" (**[**Article I, section 2**](http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#a1_sec2)**) and \"the Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments \u2026 \\[but\\] no person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present\" (**[**Article I, section 3**](https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#a1_sec3)**). The president, vice president, and all civil officers of the United States are subject to impeachment.**\n\n**The practice of impeachment originated in England and was later used by many of the American colonial and state governments. As adopted by the framers of the Constitution, this congressional power is a fundamental component of the system of \u201cchecks and balances.\u201d Through the impeachment process, Congress charges and then tries an official of the federal government for \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d The definition of \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d was not specified in the Constitution and has long been the subject of debate.**\n\n**In impeachment proceedings, the House of Representatives charges an official of the federal government by approving, by simple majority vote, articles of impeachment. After the House of Representatives sends its articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate sits as a High Court of Impeachment to consider evidence, hear witnesses, and vote to acquit or convict the impeached official. A committee of representatives, called \u201cmanagers,\u201d act as prosecutors before the Senate. In the case of presidential impeachment trials, the chief justice of the United States presides. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict, and the penalty for an impeached official upon conviction is removal from office. In some cases, the Senate has also disqualified such officials from holding public offices in the future. There is no appeal. Since 1789 about half of Senate impeachment trials have resulted in conviction and removal from office.**",
