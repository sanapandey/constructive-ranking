    "selftext": "Whenever I watch a video where Linus roasts other people's setups I always notice that he calls out people for having mousepads that are like 24cmx21cm by saying that they are too small. He also says that people who have small mousepads must be playing on high sensitivity. But this doesn't make any sense?? I have a mouse pad that's 24x21 and I use my mouse at 600 DPI and face no issues whatsoever while using a mouse pad of this size. And I thought people wanted higher DPI mice anyway?? Maybe I'm just trippin... ",

People go for higher or lower DPI based on the games they play. No one playing competitive FPS is trying to get a high DPI mouse. However, they might buy one anyways because of how customizable the DPI is. Some mice only let you change the DPI by 10, 50, 100, or more. Some let you change DPI by 1 digit at a time.
