    "selftext": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\n\nI am fully aware that this could be a one time thing and that the support rep just didn't know any better, it's why I removed their name on the screenshots. But I will still explain what happened just in case it happens again.\n\n\nI ordered the MS-01 (12600H, 32GB, 1TB SSD) back in June 2024. But a few weeks ago, it started power cycling when I try to turn it on/plug it in. I contacted Minisforum for troubleshooting steps, they sent me some, I tried it and it didn't work. Still power cycling. So return and replace process it is! \n\n\nAs seen in Photo 1, support rep had sent me a link to their official website about their warranty. Then talked about depreciation cost. But when checking the website, I saw that depreciation cost is for \"Discontinued Models that are out of stock.\" But the MS-01 is neither discontinued nor out of stock. So I replied saying just that, see Photo 2. Then in Photo 3, support rep said that depreciation cost will not be charged! Yay!\n\n\nBut I still have to pay for shipping to the US warehouse. But at least no depreciation cost.\n\n\nTLDR: Always check your warranty policy, terms and conditions. Do your due diligence, it might just save you money! ",

So they will discount the broken system you sent in by an appropriate amount, which (in an ideal capitalist world) would let you buy a lower tier version of the new lineup that has the same capabilities as your older model, because of general product improvement.\n\nIn practice, it doesn't work that way, of course, and Minisforum could just keep a stock of replacement parts for older models to avoid the situation entirely.\n\nBut that's the logic behind it, from their perspective.",

They can offer an equivalent product, repair, or refund; that's how warranties are supposed to work. \n\nNot stocking replacements/parts is very much a them issue, eating the cost of refunding/'upgrading' is a basic cost of doing business.\n\nIf they can't offer a spec equivelant replacement, using 'depreciation' to offer a lower MSRP but more performant PC could make sense - but it should be alongside the choice of refunding and definitely never be a charge to the customer.",
