    "selftext": "I have a Lenovo P520 (Xeon W-2135, 32GB DDR4, RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Windows 11) that I use for Steam Remote Play. I've been playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and I've noticed that my CPU usage is pretty high. I'm currently looking at the W-2235 which has the same core count (6c/12t) but a newer architecture and slightly faster clock speeds. Or the W-2145 which is the same generation but two more cores (8c/16t).\n\nAny suggestions? I considered the W-2245 but it's a bit out of my price range since this PC is only really used for one thing.\n\nUltimately this is a core count vs clock speed/architecture question.\n\nThanks!",

Even if they are the same socket, the mobo may not support it.\n\nUnless you're looking at the same architecture clock speeds are mostly meaningless. Even more so, 100mhz is mostly a rounding error for CPUs. The 2 extra cores are likely to help more. \n\nPassmark is showing the single core performance to be about the same, but the 2 extra cores giving a much bigger uplift.
