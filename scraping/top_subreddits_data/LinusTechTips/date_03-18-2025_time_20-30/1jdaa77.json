Andis is what my barber uses, and the maj of their stuff is made in the USA, and comes with multi year warranties (I believe their minimum is 1 year).  And again somehow costs less than Manscaped.  I\u2019m shocked!  \n\n2.) Manscaped has (and has had for years) a line of \u201cbeard and face\u201d trimmers specifically.  They even have modified the menu on their website, to make that a completely separate page, from the \u201cGroin\u201d trimmers.\n\n3.) I want people recommending products because they\u2019re good, not because they were paid by a DTC scam influencer marketing company that spends the vast majority of their budget on marketing and advertising, goes out of their way to make their products in countries without worker protection laws, and doesn\u2019t give a damn about quality or R&D.  These companies wouldn\u2019t even be able to exist at all if it wasn\u2019t for creators willingness to scam their own fans for a fat check.  30 seconds of script reading during a vid for $20,000 seems like a great deal!\n\n4.)

Also frequents Lowyat Forums to find out what people wants.\n\nBut Carousell has saved my ass once. Needed special Samsung B Die DDR4 RAM from Corsair to upgrade a 4 year old build. RAM no longer produced. Thankfully someone on Carousell just upgraded to even more RAM and was selling off their old kit.\n\nThat kit saved me a lot of money. So instead of needing to get rid of all 4x8GB of RAM, I just removed 2x8GB and replaced them with the 2x16GB I bought from that seller. 48GB total now. Warranted because the GPU was going to be a 7900XTX which has 24GB of RAM, and I read somewhere that having more RAM in the system in relation to the GPU is recommended. Also at the time some games was actually advertised to need 32GB minimum to run.",

If he goes out to a random department store or whatever it's pretty rare for him to get recognized, but if he goes to a Microcenter...\n\nAlso that tons of adults of varying ages don't know that it's even possible to make a living on Youtube. Which is one thing for my boomer mother, but was actually kinda surprising to me for my fellow Millennials. But once I thought about it it made more sense. Most people just watch TV in some form and scroll Facebook and TikTok and probably haven't been to Youtube since the Ebaumsworld era.\n\nI remember my early days of youtube was just e-mailing my best friend cool car videos we would randomly find in the search. Most people didn't stick around long enough to see the explosion in content and revenue.",

I know by the quote below, you accept being captured on cctv by using their premises and services, but does that also give the owner the freedom to do whatever they want with those tapes?\n\n>It\u2019s their private establishment. You consent by entering the business and there\u2019s usually a sign on the wall telling you \u201cyou\u2019re on camera\u201d.\n\nAlso, another comment in the original sub said the (not a thief) part of the title is because this shop usually posts cctv images of thieves there(shoplifters i presume), hence the clarification. I don\u2019t think a thief should have such protection too. \n\nOr if you capture someone stealing from your neighbor and post it on the neighborhood page as a \u201cthis dude stole ___ from X, please come to use if you have any info\u201d. Would that also be illegal then?",

And Linus has historically been averse to suing or anything related to that. His face has billions of views through LTT video views so odds are even in a country it isnt legal I doubt he'd report it - if nothing to prevent another cancellation cause \"hurr durr evil Linus reported innocent fan to cops\"",

They have official tweets of selfies with him, so it's a real possibility. Still creepy to have CCTV shots of you travelling, though.",
