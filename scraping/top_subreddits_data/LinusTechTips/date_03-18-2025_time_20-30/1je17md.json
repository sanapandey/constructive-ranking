I want to take it with me as a personal item alongside my carry on (small suitcase with wheels) and I was wondering if anyone had any difficulties fitting it under the seat. I'm travelling with KLM and their specified dimensions are around 5cm smaller than the backpack in two dimensions so I just wanted to see people's experiences. \n\nThanks! ",
