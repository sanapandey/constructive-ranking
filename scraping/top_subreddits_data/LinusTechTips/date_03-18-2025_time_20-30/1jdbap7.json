This techology is called SMT, you can google this term if you're curious. The only exceptions that can't withstand high temperatures would be connectors with plastic elements (because it'll melt) and though-hole type components. Through hole means that the pins of the components go through the board; i.e. PCI-e motherboard side connectors are trough-hole. Those usually are placed with \"wave soldering\", when a wave of molden solder is passed under the board.",
