Towards the end of the day as they were fitting off the last couple of additional lights everything suddenly turned on. Turns out someone had added a daylight switch and fed it from a new circuit, but had forgotten to add it to the legend.\n\nThey were in the process of tightening the terminals when it switched on so the fact they were using isolated tools on a circuit they thought was completely isolated is the only reason they didn't get a shock.",
