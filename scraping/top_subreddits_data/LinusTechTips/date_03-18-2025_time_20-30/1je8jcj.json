The biggest reason was keeping a low power face on that only updated every minute or with push notifications. BLE helps a lot, but so does the extreme low power idle modes of the processor.\n\n30 days will be feasible if you turn off excessive notifications and have the amount of wake timers low. Outside of the app, I'm sure folks will be able to drop the idle draw extremely low thanks to the open-source design.\n\nI preordered in Batch 1 this AM for the C2D, and I can't wait to get it.",
