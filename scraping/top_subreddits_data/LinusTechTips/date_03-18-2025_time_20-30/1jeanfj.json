For example \"\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf86\ud83c\udf87\" uses: 12 bytes, 6 character spaces while \"\u2764\ud83d\udca2\ud83d\udca5\" uses: 11 bytes and 5 character spaces. Using different length emoji help avoid spam filters. \"Hello \ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf86\ud83c\udf87\" and \"Hello \u2764\ud83d\udca2\ud83d\udca5\" from different accounts will not trigger spam filters as emoji also carry their own unique identification codes which also bypass spam filtering. \n\nIt's a pretty common tactic, as you can also hide hidden characters too. \"Hello\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e \u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\" is 161 bytes and 59 character space despite looking like 9 or 10 chars..
