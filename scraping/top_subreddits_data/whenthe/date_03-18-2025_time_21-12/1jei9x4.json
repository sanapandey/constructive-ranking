Then Twitter (and a bunch of accounts of tech failings) made me realize he was also stupid in a tech sense. My mental image of him has almost nothing good left, (other than possibly his enthusiasm for tech), and the \"Roman Salute\" definitely soured an already bad opinion into a *very* negative one.\n\n What's wild is that if he had just kept his mouth shut and run his companies, I'd probably still think that he was a genius.

And that way I see it, if you have a Nazi sitting at a table with 10 other people, you have a table with 11 Nazis.\n\nAll of those CEOs sitting behind Trump grinning ear to ear are just as responsible for this clusterfuck of a capitalist economy as Elon. So by your metrics, anyone owning an iPhone is also just as morally complicit as anyone owning a Tesla, because they also contributed financially to the success of those companies and their CEOs. So we should also go and smash people\u2019s phones as well shouldn\u2019t we?\n\nDo you see how batshit insane that sounds?? Members of the proletariat gain ABSOLUTELY NOTHING by targeting and destroying each others shit. We all have the same interests. If anything, it just benefits those billionaires by driving more wedges between us. The anger you are feeling is justified, but please take care to direct it at the proper avenue instead of random ass people living their lives.",
