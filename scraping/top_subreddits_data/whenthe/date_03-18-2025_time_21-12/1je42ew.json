But then revelation struck me like a thunderbolt from Heaven!\n\nSatan didn\u2019t need to hide his sins, he distracted the world by pointing his clawed finger at everyone else\u2019s. Each accusation was not a righteous call for justice, but a slithering confession of his own corruption. When he was finally caught red-handed, the stain of his guilt didn\u2019t stop at his hands. It consumed him whole, turning him into the very embodiment of sin.\n\nBehold, brothers and sisters! The Accuser doesn\u2019t conquer by force! He conquers by turning us against one another. He knows that if we all become accusers, none of us will stop to confess. If we let our hearts burn with the fire of condemnation instead of compassion, we do his unholy work for him.\n\nSo I say to you, beware the spirit of accusation! For every finger you point, three more point back, and you may find yourself not in the light of the Lord\u2026 but in the company of the Devil.\n\nCallout culture is not correction! It is corruption! It is the path to Hell paved with self-righteous intentions. Let mercy temper your truth, lest you become the very Satan you seek to defeat!",
