I think that people who enjoy coming together online for a specific interest are only able to have fun doing so because they keep it at an arm's length. There are plenty of people who invest themselves into their interests to an \\*extreme\\* degree, and those are the people who will gatekeep, shame, belittle and antagonize others. That's the experience I've had with all social media, and tumblr in particular: Reddit just feels designed to be a website of passing interests than invested passions.\n\nPeople who call themselves Redditors have taken this website to the degree that I said I dislike, which is why I don't associate my interests with this (or any) website. I'm way more than a few hobbies and interests, so I cannot see the value in devoting an online presence to engaging with that.
