Not only is it only unoriginal brainrot but a brainrot version of a masterpiece show which was way ahead of its time and was perfect from start to finish. It deeply saddens me to see how that excellent show's legacy is being carried forward by this abysmal filth. I have really really low standards and yet this dogshit excuse of a show managed to disgust me as a kid. If someone tolde this show was made to torture the inmates in the deepest pits of hell by forcing them to watch this, i wouldn't be surprised at all. I would rather have my kids watch skibidi toilet than allow them in 10 km radius of a tv playing teen titans go.",

The way the show is written has noticably changed over the years, so when people are talking about TTG being good, they aren't changing history about the weak early seasons, they're talking about the later seasons where the show stopped trying to defend its own existence and just became a shitpost series.",

Kids deserve to know about how the world works, and some of the stuff this show explains are things that, honestly, a significant number of adults have missed. Like, there is a whole episode that explains MLM/pyramid schemes and why they are a scam to take your money. Teen Titans is out there doing the lord's work.",
