But neither would I advocate for removing the death penalty or not doing rehabilitation for these crimes. For a couple reasons, but mainly:\nThe legal definition and dictionary definition of crimes are different. A sex offender could be the actual definition of a sex offender, or it could be a gay or trans person existing in public. It is imperative that the death penalty gets removed for all crimes, otherwise it sets a precedent that it can be used for some crimes, the list of which can be expanded by the whims of those in charge.\nThe state should never have the right to murder people.",

Yes, it's true that a history of colonialism by exploitative external influences can contribute to the development of brutal regimes. It's true that poverty is related to crime due to the lack of opportunity and social services. It's also true, however, that those things, while facilitated by environmental forces, stem from a variety of personal choices and the actions of individuals with ill intentions.\n\nThere is an alarming amount of discourse on those topics carried out with an air of, \"Well, what else could they have done? How can you blame them?\" as if the people involved are genuinely incapable of thinking for themselves. There are times when it gets so bad that it sounds like they're describing half-people beholden purely to the whims of greater powers with no agency or rational thought. It's really disturbing to see given how reminiscent it is of the \"white man's burden\" attitude that was often used to justify the original intervention historically.\n\nTreating people like they're incapable of stopping themselves from hurting others, be it on an individual scale or a societal one, in times of hardship sends a very different message than intended, and constantly refocusing on that idea prevents a real discussion about what to do now that the situation is what it is from taking place. I've had to disengage from a lot of leftist spaces for similar reasons (in addition to the pretentious moral circlejerking that is coupled with these narratives simply being exasperating).",

No I dont like rapists but I don't want to sacrifice 20 innocent people to kill a rapist because of your fetish for vengeance.\n\nAlso if you look at the death penalty statistics it just so happens that minorities happen to be on the death penalty more often. Isn't that a fun coincidence?

Is it bad to think some things are worse and less worthy of forgiveness than other things?\n\nPeople asking for rehabilitation but also think child predators and rapists should not be rehabilitated into a world where they are a danger to everyone they are around is not some hypocricy, but more closer to current law: the crime determines the response. Criminal negligence, manslaughter, murder, homicide all have different levels of punishment dependent on their severity. The issue that rehabilitationists have is that the prison system in the US is malformed. It is intended to punish people for committing crimes rather than try to address why they commit those crimes.\n\nFines punish poor people and imprisonment is legalised removal of an American's freedoms. And now there is a president that if he disagrees with someone he will deport them - a rehabilitationist would argue that violent protestors should be rehabilitated, not forced out of their birth country.\n\nPeople should be rehabilitated for their crimes. There is rehabilitation in many countries and they are proven to reduce crime recidivism. The people asking for rehabilitation are not suddenly hypocrites or wrong to think the world would be better if child rapists weren't allowed to be part of society.",
