You will need some screen and/or video recording software, a mic, and a YouTube account.\n\nAudio quality is the most important thing to focus on from a technical standpoint. \n\nMake a video about anything, just go through the motions. \n\nThere is free software out there meld studio and OBS. OBS is the standard, but meld is much more user friendly to start with if OBS is intimidating.\n\nYou'll also need a video editor software to edit your video. DaVinci Resolve is an amazing pro software that is free unless you need 8k and other pro options. But you can likely find simpler software for that too if you want. \n\nUpload the video, make sure to properly set all the settings in the description, etc. And then slowly repeat over and over.\n\nJust like how authors gain their 'voice' by writing more. YouTubers do the same. (Ironically most of my videos are on educational platforms, but still, the point stands)",

Treat this like a hobby for now, and pay attention to your responsibilities. Also, don't be discouraged when you only get 10 views a video for a year. Treat it like you're just doing these videos for you as a creative outlet and for nobody else. Do what YOU want to do.\n\n2.) Money. If you're going to be filming, you do NOT need the latest $1,000 camera. Literally just use your phone. Phone cameras are INSANELY underrated. Just get yourself a tripod and use your phone and get a lapel mic for like $20-$30. Also, pirate all your editing software. I loved using Premiere Pro for editing, Aftereffects, and Photoshop when I used to do video projects. These are what I used, but there are plenty of other options that are free, and some would argue they are better but I'm not familiar with other software.\n\n3.) Consistency and growth. Keep learning new things to implement into your videos. Start with a basic concept that's like 5 minutes long. Don't treat your first video like it's your Magnum Opus and spend 5 months on it when you're still learning. Just pump out content consistently and learn as you go. Your first videos are going to suck, AND THAT'S OK. There is not a SINGLE big YouTuber on this planet that goes \"oh yeah, that video I made 5+ years ago? I love it! It's so good.\" If you're planning on streaming and making stream highlight videos, have a nice layout and implement bots to display when someone follows and stuff like that.\n\nJust make what you want to make.
