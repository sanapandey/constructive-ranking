Second, if you\u2019ve been banned on that channel, you\u2019re able to leave a comment but it\u2019s hidden the moment you post it. \nAnd last, some channels have moderation settings that will let YouTube auto hold comments and replies until the creator approves them. \n\nThese are all legit reasons why comments and replies might not be showing up even though the count shows them. Not saying that there could be some BS going on, but I have yet to personally see anything like that on the many channels I manage.",
