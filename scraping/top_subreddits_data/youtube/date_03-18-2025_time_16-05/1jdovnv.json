The three available varieties\u2014The Pizza, Turkey Stack 'Ems, and Fiesta Nachos\u2014mirror Lunchables' popular kits. This resemblance has led to accusations that Lunchly is merely a repackaged version of existing products, misleading consumers about its purported uniqueness and health benefits. \n\n\n\nShortly after its launch, reports emerged of mold found in Lunchly products. Notably, YouTuber Rosanna Pansino posted a video in October 2024 showing moldy mozzarella cheese in a Lunchly pizza kit, despite it being within its expiration date. She highlighted that such issues pose significant health risks, especially to children.  Following her revelation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received over ten complaints about Lunchly products, with at least one consumer reporting illness after consumption. \n\n\nWhile Lunchly markets itself as a healthier alternative, analyses suggest otherwise. Family physician and YouTuber Doctor Mike reviewed the product and noted that although it contains slightly less sugar and saturated fat than Lunchables, a child would need to consume approximately 2.7 Lunchly Turkey Stack 'Ems to meet their recommended lunchtime calorie intake. This would result in consuming nearly the entire recommended daily intake of sodium, challenging Lunchly's health claims. \n\n\n\nThe founders' reactions to the criticisms have further fueled the controversy. Logan Paul, in particular, dismissed concerns by attacking critics on social media and disabling comments on his posts, actions perceived as evasive rather than addressing the core issues.  This approach has led to a perception that the founders are more interested in profit than consumer well-being, reinforcing the notion of Lunchly being a scam.\n\nLunchly's close resemblance to existing products, coupled with health and safety issues and questionable marketing practices, has led people with common sense to view it as a deceptive venture.\n\n\nNow tell me, why is it not a scam?",

I saw the same dr Mike video, he even went on the fellas podcast to talk about it. He at the end agreed that although it's not a scam, it isnt fully ethical to tell children something is \"healthier\" because they will think that healthier means healthy. However, once again, that is a marketing trick. Scammers get arrested for fraud. Lunchly will never be accused of fraud because thats not what they are doing and anyone over the age of 18 understands this.\n\nEdit: Also, being more interested in Profit than consumer well-being IS NOT SCAMMING.

Look at the earlier reactions to some of his music compared to the Thick of It. JJ had some much worse songs that he was clowned on for (such as Poppin), but his reaction was better to it. He was annoyed, but he kinda took it in stride unlike with Thick of It. But Logan has made things worse for 2 reasons:\n\n1) the obvious one, Logan's an arrogant prick and has been amplifying JJ's worst traits through his influence and attitude, so he feels he is above everyone and always in the right (look at his \"beef\" with Dantdm and his tantrum after losing to Tommy Fury)\n2) the more subtle one, Logan's controversies and awful behaviour (namely scamming fans with Cryptozoo, suing Coffeezilla to shut him up, the Collab with Mr Beast and the mouldy food) means JJ has to choose to wilfully ignore/justify what he's doing in order to keep the business arrangement afloat. He can't call Logan out because he'll lose his partnership, but he also can't defend him because that would be stupid, so he pretends like nothing's wrong and just promotes Paul and Prime with his dying breath.",

Why is Jeremy incapable of paying even the tiniest bit of attention to a movie if the plot is more complicated than a Marvel movie?\n\nThe comments of their videos are absolutely *littered* with highly upvoted comments of people thanking CinemaSins for warning them not to watch movies with a lot of sins in it, and that's a clear indicator that a lot of people don't read it as satire because it isn't. It's lazy slop they pass off as satire for a \"get-out-of-mistakes free\" card.",

That earned a bit of respect from me.\n\nBut still, his current content is unbearable. He just LOVES Trump. Seems to have a huge blind spot for him even since 2017. It's a shame",

Some \"trumpian\" content can be obnoxious, but I think the worst thing we can do (and society is moving more towards this) is to not hear the other side and just demonize them from far away.\n\nI enjoy watching Asmon for this reason to not be totally deluded in left wing channels; hearing the other side keeps me grounded.\n\n\nAnd I'm curious why you don't like Asmon's react content btw. I know that's tangential but I always held him as like the golden standard for reaction content. If you're gonna do it, I feel he does it as ethically as you can most of the time.

No, people will not watch the original video, why would they rewatch a video you just posted?\n\nOfcourse there is the argument that these react videos make the original makers of the video more popular. \nI have no statistics on this, but my hunch is that it does not happen nearly as much to justify this and i highly doubt Asmon nor Xqc and the likes actually give a fuck about whether these channels get a boost on views or not.\nThey just want easy money with as little effort as possible and if that means stealing (how i see it) other peoples work they will do it, and they have been doing it for a long time.\n\nI will watch his apology video later btw.",

By the second hour and beyond he's pretty much spamming the same Avatar: The Last Airbender GIF non-stop. All it culminated to was six hours of 'erm actually this is bad' without really building it to anything.

I was watching some random Austin John Plays video trying to learn something about wormholes or breeding or somethin, AJP takes a random shot at Verlisify without name dropping just kinda being like \"I am here to give you the viewer information. Truthful information. Not spread lies like other poketubers who don't like other poketubers.\" Didn't know what was going on, went to the comments, learned who verlisify was pretty quick from there.\n\n\nFunnies thing is, I went and watched a couple of verlisifys vids afterwards and all his videos were hating on USUM before they released, the games release, then he magically is praising them (which afaik he has done EVERY. GAME. SINCE GEN 7. And maybe before gen 7), and in one video in particular he name drops hating Austin John plays for not putting out accurate information on the games. AJPs accuracy of game features and guides and all he does is the reason I watch him lmfao. When he name dropped Austin tho I got an itch to search on YT and Google \"Why does everyone hate Austin John Plays\" and maybe like a couple reddit threads showed up.\n\nBut when I did the same for Verlisify.....bro there are so many videos, and theres a handful of videos that pass an hour long. That cringe ass dude easily has hundreds of videos of dozens of random people calling him out for lying about game/battle mechanics, flip-flopping opinions on games after they release, being anti-LGBT, staring false rumors about other content creators who disagree with him or that he doesn't like, narcissism, racism, white supremacy, the list goes on.\n\nDude even AI generated his YouTube profile photo(i think it was his pfp), and then in a comment on a video about his AI art that said \"don't think you're a real artist now\" he replies \"there is an art to using AI. This thing I made using AI is proof of my artistic skills.\"\n\nEdit because how could I forget the racism :)",

It was no longer fun to watch his videos and I unsubscribed and have not watched him since 2021.\n\nHe really needs to just move on from Call of Duty and find other games he likes to play.

Some of them I'd agree with but the way he rants about everything and anything he doesn't like and always about it being woke even with it has nothing to do with being woke got more annoying than funny quick.  If you made a drinking game out of it you'd be blacked out in 5 minutes.  He also (poorly) attempts personal attacks on anyone who tries to dispute him with facts and when that doesn't work he deletes their comments (speaking from experience)",

We could all use a lot more creative/positive channels that's for sure, but I get why these negative ones get traction so much easier/more, but when something pops off on YouTube, YT WANTs you to make more of that, so the creators end up in a weird negative feedback loop, and its not good for anyone.
