    "selftext": "The level of censorship is getting outright ridiculous. Completely normal comments are being deleted for seemingly no reason. It's clearly not a faulty spam filter, considering bots are absolutely rampant all over YouTube.\n\nI'm so tired of getting a reply just to click on it and see nothing.\n\nI'm so tired of clicking on a \"15 replies\" comment to see 2 replies.\n\nI'm so tired of trying to have any meaningful discussion just to have my comment get removed for no reason.\n\nI've also seen others say the full, uncensored N word in their comments and not get deleted, aswell as other slurs such as the R slur.\n\nWe *need* a big YouTuber make a video and raise more awareness of this problem. I see alot of people have been noticing it over the last few weeks but it's not enough.",
