    "selftext": "Around January, this dumbass screen kept popping up on my app, preventing me from opening and using the Youtube app. I figured out that I could bypass this problem by clearing the app's data every time I opened it, which was annoying, but I got used to it pretty quickly, so it wasn't too big of a deal.\n\nNow literally 5 minutes ago, clearly Youtube has figured out about this bypass and have patched it, and now I cannot access my app whatsoever no matter what I do. Fuck this shit. Why should I need to update the app and use the shitty website when there was clearly absolutely nothing wrong with the app. It worked perfectly fine, but no, they have to intentionally block me from using the app just because my phone is a little bit old. Fuck off. The website is dog shit on phones. For God's sake. First world problems, I ghess",
