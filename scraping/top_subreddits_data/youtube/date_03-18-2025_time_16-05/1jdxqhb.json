If you spend some time looking into it, I have only touched on it and have read about this due to the amount of psychology I keep up with. If you spend time online looking at other stuff, it's not something I'd expect you to have suggested to you, and therefore you wouldn't be reading about it. We have circles of information we consume. Some overlap, some don't. If you want to understand how it affects the brain on a neurological perspective or chemical perspective then you are better to research it yourself. For me it's something I have seen, but I focus more on other psychology. So it's not my strong point to effectively provide you with the correct science.",

I have no idea why, it just makes me uncomfortable. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m not done with the game and I\u2019m avoiding spoilers like the plague. If you have played the game you can tell me and I\u2019ll be fine, but for some reason when someone brings it up or starts talking about it in a youtube video I get uncomfortable, it\u2019s like I\u2019m parasocial with the game or something idk what\u2019s wrong with me. This is the only game this happens to me with (sorry I went on a tangent but yeah Mike compared it too much to Danganronpa to rake in views and as someone with less than 200 subs it pissed me off that he was just using a popular game to get traction on his other videos, which is how youtube works, but then again, strangely parasocial with the game)",
