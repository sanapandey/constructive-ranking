            "body": "MrBeast hate aside it was just like...an objectively bad show. Everything in the first ep screams \"we just want this for the Wikipedia article and rankings lists\". Most players, biggest prize, most cameras...it's all just to top a bunch of internet rankings. But then you get to the actual show and it's like...75% of the \"games\" are just bribing people to leave or eliminating whole swaths of people based on the actions of one person. Imagine all the hype of being on the show only to be one of the people dumped in the first episode through no fault of your own. Hell the smartest people there were the ones who took the initial bribe and left w/ $20k and their dignity. And any games that aren't bribes are just like drop/roll/throw a ball games. Gigantic budget and you could make every \"game\" in your backyard for $5. Like I get standing by your work and I guess it'd be weird if he was out there like \"yeah this thing I sunk a ton of time & money into sucked\" but glazing it *this* hard is rough.",

I would double both ratings. 8/10 for the last Invincible episode and a 4/10 for Beast Games sounds right. When you have stuff like Squid Game: the Challenge Mr Beasts thing isn\u2019t the worst. \n\nAnd people are overhyping the last invincible episode to an insane degree. Medium quality animation, a great introduction to a character, but overall I would say it didn\u2019t hit as hard as the first seasons ending and there are just much better animated shows out there. I\u2019m watching Solo Levelling which is releasing weekly and they make a better fight every 5 episodes or so, because they spend so much more on animation and so much less on voice actors.",

Yet Jimmy decides that it is a good idea to shove it trough our mouth, not once, but twice. The finale being so mid left me with a bitter final taste about the show. Oh and let's not forget about the pretty constant adds which is imo a total no-go for a show.  \nMeanwhile Invincible felt like an actual show, had a lot of plot (none of it was rushed or stretched tho) and while the animation was rough from time to time it was also peak when it really mattered, that being the final 2 episodes which not only jhad great animation but were also filled with action to the end, hence the final episode even had a 10/10 rating at some point (now it is at a 9.9/10).",

He's not trying to claim that his show is comparable to Invincible.\n\nAs a wise Twitter user once said: \n\n\"Twitter the only place where well articulated sentences still get misinterpreted.\n\nYou can say 'I like pancakes' and somebody will say 'So you hate waffles?'\n\nNo bitch.
