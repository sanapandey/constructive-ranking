There is a strength, calm and empathy in them that makes them excellent partners.\n\nBut frankly, who hasn't been is some kind of trauma these days when you're a bit older. The once that refuse to accept or face it though, they are only going to bleed on everyone around them. And probably drag their partners down with them if they can.",
