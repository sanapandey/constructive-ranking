Seems like it would make sense for police, insurance, and the individual driving the vehicle. Doesn\u2019t have to be some crazy expensive one. They\u2019re pretty cheap at this point. With all the features that some of these cars have, seems like it\u2019s a no brainer.\n\nEDT: Answered",

Research everyone with whom you do business and do one's best to anonymize every transaction. Change logins. \n\nIt's not possible to leave no trace, but YouTube doesn't know which demographic I'm in (by the adds they show me) so I feel like I'm doing *something* right. \n\nMany moons ago the military taught me that espionage is rarely about getting all the information up front, but by connecting dots - and our age of automation makes that easy.

It works as much against you as for you. Once you add that to Ford's cloud storage,  it's all there. Remember that time last year that you drove 25 over,  and called a guy a \"fucking idiot\", because he was changing his speed from 10 under to 15 over and weaving across 3 lanes without paying attention?  Yeah,  you did it to get away and be safer,  but the attorney on the other side will use that as proof that you're aggressive. Once it's in someone else's cloud,  they will find it, even if it doesn't apply to the crash you had.",

Liability for when it stops working and how it can be used against manufacturer, cost is the varied design changes and integration and storage in how video data will be stored. Most manufacturers do not currently want (but there are some who do) to deal with these issues. It is also not something the market has demanded.\n\n\nThe dig at older people is weird here, but I get it, without understanding or an argument to make, one must create a boogeyman. That is why your entire comment is an attack.\n\n>Anyone 45+ is going to froth at the mouth\n\nThat is not at all true, but regardless, we grew up (formative years at least) in an age where we were 100% private, no one had free associated access to all of our data. The younger generation is making fun of us for being suspicious and weary of it.\n\nI mean, could you all be anymore backward on this?\n\nOn one hand there are millions of people of all ages (I am sure you are included in this) who decry this age of collecting and selling personal data, entire governments are passing laws and regulations, suing big companies. Identity theft is at an all-time high and most of us agree with it.\n\nBut someone posts something about more privacy violations and you are like \"lol boomers be stupid\" because they do this other thing.?\n\nThe small mind makes the comparison and says \"how dumb lolz\" the person who thinks understand that there is nuance in the world and cutting yourself off completely is not the only option, it does not make you a hypocrite or stupid to partake in a similar endeavor that also steals data.  Mitigation is part of nuance, bring light to something is also.  It is not black and white or one or the other.\n\nI mean...\n\n\nNow that said, doing the ridiculous dumb rural southern trump voter nonsense just invalidates you completely up front. If you have to make it seems as if any criticism is from someone dumb and presumably evil, you have already lost the argument because it shows you have nothing substantial to argue with.  When you couple that with wide brushing the \"same people who say this, also do that\" nonsense makes your empty argument even weaker.\n\n\nBoomers, ***just like every generation*** have very different people from all walks of life with many varied opinions on all kinds of subjects. Generational critiques are always invalid and come from a shallow mind.",
