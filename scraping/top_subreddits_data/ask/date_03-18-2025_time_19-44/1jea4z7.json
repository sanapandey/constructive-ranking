Like for me, if I knew I had the genetics to have a shot at worlds best, there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019d have access to some level of sponsorship. But like, I could not justify giving up my job, and therefore my house and the financial security I\u2019ve built to dedicate myself to training athletics every day of every week when *I know factually* that I will never be remotely as fast, even if I could get to my theoretical limit of running speed, I simply don\u2019t have the leg length to compete with the big boys.\n\nThat being said, I absolutely do believe that if I did decide that I wanted to be a runner, I could become probably a pretty good one, even with my stumpy sausage legs.  I might even go as far as regionals or national competition if I got really super into it. I think that\u2019s the important difference in OP\u2019s OP. You really can *do anything* if you have sufficient time and effort to put in - and most things, especially the things involving physical activity, are just locked behind putting a bunch of time and effort in to train and get good at it.",

You might not be able to sing opera professionally, but you'd be more than capable of holding your own in a pop/rock group and you wouldn't embarrass yourself at the yearly Christmas carol concert.\n\n(This is assuming you don't have any kind of serious hearing impediment, and have intact vocal cords, i.e. you haven't been operated on for throat cancer or whatever).",
