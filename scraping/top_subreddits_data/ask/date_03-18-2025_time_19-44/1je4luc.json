People don\u2019t treat kids like they are people. Also, abusers can be good at disguising themselves from the crowd. If a child speaks up, people are disillusioned from the reality they face, because they don\u2019t see that behavior from the adult or what the child is going through. Lastly some people simply don\u2019t care. The behavior can become so normalized.",

They've often had 6+ years of education, and have focused solely on this single issue for decades and they still can't always get it right.\n\nImagine you get 100 child claims, and let's even imagine you have the benefit of knowing 30 are real (ruin the lives of the parents, fuck them), 30 are exaggerated (but some family resources would be helpful), and 40 are flat out lies (family should be left 100% in peace).

There is more awareness now, but we're still a long way to go. \n\nAbusive ppl are really good at making themselves look like victims. People can recognize bruises, but can the average person look at someone who looks tired from being manipulated or emotionally disregulated from being sleep deprived, or they seem reactive and angry but that's because theyve been triangulated and gas lit into compliance with unfair situations that take away their dignity? Not likely. It usually takes a trained professional to ask the right questions. \n\nFor example- in romantic relationships people can easily see the outspoken and assertive partner as controlling. But when the couple hangs out, whose friends do they hang out with. What do they do together. If the entire relationship exists in the quieter person's comfort zone, most people wont see that the more passive partner might be the controlling one. \n\nIn the parent child situation, does the parent measure their success as a parent with a kid that feels like a competent decision maker? Or by having a kid that appears well adjusted and is compliant? Everyone wont see the straight A kid as a victim. Or they will assume the kid who is having behavioral issues has bad character. When really they could be emotionally neglected and just unable to function in neglect.",

They're thinking of how they would feel and reacting. You're way more likely to give your story to a parent than a child.
