    "selftext": "\n\n\n\nHow do you keep conversations flowing, especially when your job requires strong social skills? I struggle with small talk, particularly when the other person is introverted or dismissive\u2014worse if I\u2019m also introverted, because then the conversation just dies.\n\nI want to build rapport, but I find it tricky to ask personal questions without seeming nosy. At the same time, I don\u2019t want every interaction to feel purely businesslike\u2014I\u2019d love to contribute something valuable to the conversation and leave a good impression. But I tend to overthink things, and sometimes I feel like I run out of meaningful things to say.\n\nIt gets even more challenging in my industry because most of the people I talk to are twice my age or major players in the field, which makes finding common ground (and not feeling intimidated) even harder. Do you have any advice, hacks, or techniques to develop better communication and socialization skills?\n\nThanks!",

Not everyone is chatty and that\u2019s ok\n\nMy favourite way is to compliment them or ask for help. Ask follow ups and build off that. I find flattery helps a lot and the conversation flows better as long as it\u2019s not something too personal you\u2019re commenting on. Outfit and accessories are generally pretty safe since it\u2019s something that\u2019s often changed. You can ask where they got it, mention you\u2019ve been looking for something just like it, etc. Ask them how they like this item and if it\u2019s worth it. I often love to compliment someone\u2019s skin, hair, makeup and ask them their secrets",

This lets us commiserate about our respective jobs, the plusses and minuses, etc.  and if you see them regularly, you can ask them how work is going to build up a familiarity.\n\nIf you already know what their job is, you can ask what it's like doing that job, with similar results.\n\nAnd if you work in the same field, never be afraid to go to your seniors for advice!  \"Hey, this part of the job is a bit difficult, can you give me tips?\" will let them know you respect their experience AND that you're dedicated to improving your own skills.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to straight-up ask 'so what do you like to talk about?'. Everyone has some topic they're very enthusiastic about.  Let them show you what it is!  \n\nAnd if they're reserved or dismissive... Respect that!  Ask them if trying to make small talk bothers them, and if they'd prefer to just stick to business.  Some people do, and that's okay!  Respecting their preferences will actually encourage them to feel more comfortable around you, and potentially open up more over time.\n\nRelevant experience: 20+ years of customer service (also, I'm autistic, so I had to learn all of this the hard way)",
