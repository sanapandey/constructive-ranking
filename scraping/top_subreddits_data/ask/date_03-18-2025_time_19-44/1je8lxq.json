But it was revealed in deeper analysis that the spending was deeply inefficient, while they were growing the economy fantastically fast, they were spending 10 times as much money as the west's slower but more sustainable growth.\n\nThey truly lost the fight in like 1969 when they refused to implement the theories of Leonid Kantorovich, whose Nobel-prize winnings ideas of price regulation in a planned economy (shadow prices) would have solved the compounding inefficiencies in their planning. But after events like the Novocherkassk massacre in 1962 (over a raise of meat prices), the leadership felt giving economists the ability to set prices was too much power, and it had to reside solely within the party. This kept the deep and growing inefficiencies from the ground up and slowly the bloat (and constantly growing corruption to bypass the bloat) was like a weight chained to the country, eventually it couldn't drag it any further. Shadow prices would have given them capitalist-like resource allocation and automatic detection of inefficiencies, it was desperately needed but unfortunately the leadership couldn't make the leap, they thought the status quo could go forever.",

If he'd had a flash of inspiration and ordered reforms leading to something like market socialism as well as allowing people more freedom in their private lives (while repudiating spreading communism by war), the USSR would still exist and be a near-peer to the US.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism?wprov=sfla1",

They told their people that they had it great while the rest of the world did not, and they took away freedom of speech and freedom of the press so that they had a monopoly on information, when the reality was quite different. This included scientific research.\n\nChernobyl, and other Soviet nuclear reactors, used a design that was known to be unsafe by nuclear scientists outside of the Iron Curtain. The KGB knew, too, but they put a lid on the information, so the scientists did not initially understand it when the nuclear reactor exploded during that little experiment they were running. After what happened at Chernobyl, the truth got out, which lead to the government turning to a policy of openness (Glasnost), which lead to the first McDonald\u2019s opening in the Soviet Union (which was run far better than state-run businesses), which ended up causing the whole thing to collapse.",

            "body": "The USSR faced significant challenges in the Cold War and, ultimately, never stood a real chance of winning when competing with the West, particularly the United States, in areas like weapons production and economic capacity. The West effectively forced the Eastern Bloc into a relentless race to match its production capabilities, especially in military and technological advancements. However, the Cold War was never just a contest between the USSR and the USA\u2014it was a broader struggle between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc.\n\nOne of the key advantages of the United States was its network of willing allies, in stark contrast to the nations coerced into the Warsaw Pact. A system built on suppressing other nations and even its own people is inherently unsustainable. Such a system must divert substantial resources to maintain control, leaving it vulnerable unless its adversary operates in a similarly repressive manner.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster was a pivotal moment that exposed the USSR's vulnerabilities. Until then, both Western and Eastern societies largely believed that the USSR was technologically on par with the United States. Chernobyl shattered this illusion. The botched attempts to cover up the incident, the willingness to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives, and the blatant disregard for its own population revealed the USSR's indifference to its people. This eroded trust and further highlighted the system's fragility.\n\nHow can a system survive when it lacks the support of its own people? The USSR's inability to prioritize its citizens' welfare over its ideological and geopolitical ambitions ultimately sealed its fate. Chernobyl was not the sole reason for the USSR's collapse, but it symbolized the broader systemic failures that made victory in the Cold War unattainable.",

                    "body": "Excellent write up, but there are a couple things i'd like to add:\n\nComing out of WWII, the US was an absolute juggernaught in terms of innovation, economic growth, and industrial capacity having been barely scratched by the impacts of WWII. At that time, basically all of europe and the eastern bloc were rebuilding from the devistating impacts of WWII. This put the US at a massive economic advantage right from the start. So much so that you could arguably say that *no one* had a chance at competing with the US.\n\nAlso, population demographics put the USSR at a significant disadvantage as well. This is because the soviet union suffered the most casualties in WWII, both civilian and military, to the tune of around 20-30 million in total. Of the military casualties, which make up about half of that figure, the overwhelming majority were able bodied men aged 18-25. WWII effectively cost the soviet union an entire generation of young able bodied men, leaving only older men, young boys, women, and the disabled, which is not an ideal labor force considering the type of hard labor that needed to be done at that time. Meanwhile, the US was getting ready to have a huge population boom.\n\nAll this means that even if the USSR hadn't been badly mismanaged, it still likely would not have been capable of truly rivaling the US economically. But, they did put on a very convincing facade up until chernobyl, and to their credit there are a few things the soviets did genuinely do pretty well, like their space program.\n\nEdit: soviet casualty figure was incorrect.",

While not 100 million, these are still staggering figures that underline the immense human cost.\n\n**Add 2:** I agree that the United States emerged as the dominant power after WWII. Western Europe, as reliable allies of the U.S. for decades, benefited significantly from the post-war rebuilding process. A crucial factor in this recovery was the Marshall Plan, which provided a vital head start. Interestingly, the Marshall Plan was initially open to participation by Eastern European nations. However, the USSR actively prevented the countries it occupied from joining the program, further deepening the divide between East and West.\n\n**Add 3:** In my opinion, the decisive factor that led to the West\u2019s victory and the East\u2019s downfall was rooted in structure and mindset. Western capitalist industry was simply more efficient at producing high-quality weapons in large quantities, supported by robust financing. In contrast, the Soviet Union adhered to an outdated approach\u2014one that Russia, to this day, seems unable to fully shake off.\n\nWhile the West invested in training its soldiers to achieve high proficiency, the USSR relied on overwhelming numbers, sacrificing countless lives in the process. This pattern persists, as we see in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Reports suggest that Russia has already lost around 900,000 soldiers who were killed or severely wounded\u2014a grim figure resulting from a strategy that prioritizes numbers over strategic planning. By comparison, Ukrainian losses, while significant, are estimated to be less than a tenth of Russia\u2019s. Of course, these losses hit harder for Ukraine due to its smaller population, but the Russian approach demonstrates a glaring disregard for human life. A more sophisticated strategy could reduce casualties and improve overall performance.\n\nConsider the issue of administration: Russian forces struggle with basic logistical oversight. They lack accurate knowledge of their stockpiles because low-ranking officers frequently loot warehouses, falsifying records to cover their actions. Higher-ranking officials further manipulate these numbers to maintain appearances for their superiors. This cycle creates an environment of overconfidence (based on lies), high casualties (due to outdated strategies and neglect of soldiers\u2019 welfare), and a resistance to improvement (because subordinates fear challenging authority).\n\nIt's akin to driving at high speed on the Autobahn while ignoring the warning lights and strange noises coming from under the hood. You might make it to your destination, or you might break down catastrophically along the way. This systemic dysfunction has long plagued the Russian approach, hindering its ability to adapt and succeed.",

It's kind of crazy they accomplished what they did.\n\n>  \nThe USSR faced significant challenges in the Cold War and, ultimately, never stood a real chance of winning when competing with the West, particularly the United States, in areas like weapons production and economic capacity.\u00a0\n\nWhy is this exactly? You don't really give a reason. I mean there were efforts to develop wholly new technologies, but often leadership shot them down with the idea that they should just copy another country's developments, which is a reason that kept them only playing catch-up, but why would it be inherently impossible for them to compete? \n\n>  \nthe willingness to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives\n\nChernobyl didn't kill hundreds of thousands of people... The internationally recognized death toll is like 31. The highest estimate is like 4000, counting potential deaths down the line as to blame for it for uncaught radiation exposure. \n\n>  \nthe blatant disregard for its own population revealed the USSR's indifference to its people. This eroded trust and further highlighted the system's fragility.\n\n>How can a system survive when it lacks the support of its own people? The USSR's inability to prioritize its citizens' welfare over its ideological and geopolitical ambitions ultimately sealed its fate.\n\nI would argue that nothing about Chernobyl showed a blatant disregard for its own population. It just demonstrated a distrust of transparency. They didn't want to share any information. The entire leadership was allergic to sharing information. But to say they had a blatant disregard? The mobilization by the government was intense and expensive, they worked hard to rapidly evacuate Pripyat for good, thousands of workers with a surprisingly low death toll helped stabilize the situation, they spent billions and billions on it.\n\n  \nOppression, coerced allies, lack of trust in leadership, that all certainly contributed, but it was structural economic inefficiencies that really played the massive role and in are likely to blame FOR those failings more than anything. Like you, as a party leadership for a region, know about how billions of rubles are being wasted, but to say how means you are saying your leadership in the economic planning office is literally committing treason. So secrecy becomes kind of built in, you know there are things you simply cannot address. If they're wrong about the pricing on this one commodity, you're saying they could be wrong about everything.\n\nThis was the central snowball of problems in my opinion. Post Khrushchev, where penalties became comparatively light and easy, more people were boldened to take steps against the massive inefficiencies in the system and arrange their own deals to provide for themselves. These booming black markets only served to worsen everything, but even the leadership was known to utilize them, they are not going to have a shortage of anything in their house. The soviet economist Leonid Kantorovich actually designed a brilliant system of linear programming and shadow prices as an guideline for economic planning that would have automatically detected misallocated resources via a supply-and-demand-esque competitive model, and he won a 1969 Nobel prize in economics for it, but the leadership was never willing to give up the power of prices after the Novocherkassk massacre in 62 and I think that's more than anything what led to their complete downfall. The inefficiencies compounded, the resource misallocations compounded, and eventually the whole country is being dragged down by bloat. And the bloat and waste only make secrecy more critical and transparency threatening. \n\nChernobyl was a crack in the facade, not some foundational pillar giving way, basically.",

We must also consider the vast number of people who suffered long-term health issues, particularly cancer.\n\nNow, back to the initial question: could the USSR have prevailed, or even won the Cold War? **Potentially: yes. Factually: no.** The USSR ruled over an immense landmass, abundant with natural resources such as coal, gas, oil, gold, diamonds, minerals, rare earths, and vast agricultural capacity. It was the largest empire the world has ever seen, blessed with incredible riches. Yet, it failed. We all know that. It didn\u2019t have to fail\u2014but it did.\n\n1. **Structural Issues:** I believe the USSR suffered from inherent structural flaws that fostered mistrust, suppressed initiative, and stifled productivity. This is often a hallmark of autocracies and dictatorships, where \"yes-men\" thrive while free thinkers keep their heads down out of fear.\n2. **Rural Development:** While it\u2019s true that the USSR managed to industrialize a significant rural population, this achievement was offset by its vastness. Rural areas often lacked sufficient development, particularly in logistics and telecommunications.\n3. **The Resource Curse:** I believe the USSR became a victim of its immense natural wealth. Borrowing from Fernand Braudel's ideas about the periphery and center, history demonstrates that regions with fewer natural resources often become hubs of manufacturing and industry, fostering societal and infrastructural development. In contrast, resource-rich areas tend to stagnate, relying on selling raw materials rather than developing a diverse economy.\n\nLooking at Russia today, the largest post-sowiet state, this pattern persists. Despite its extraordinary natural wealth and the billions generated from selling crude oil, gas, and gold, much of this wealth is squandered on futile wars. Russia is already the largest country on Earth\u2014why pursue more wars? These vast resources could have been invested in developing infrastructure, building industries that could compete on a global scale, and creating opportunities for its people. Instead, it has been wasted on conflict, leaving the potential for true progress unrealized. I know there is some reasoning in it, that only makes sense for an autocratic mind. It's just sad.",

They also had many brother states that needed USSR money to keep afloat. \n\nIn terms of technology, sure they have many inventions of their own. But more often, they need to steal it from the US and the West. USSR technology mainly focused on military use, which is hard to transfer to public domain. And they would rather keep everything as secret than let the public use it. In the early 80s, people in the West were using colour TVs for years, and Russians were still using B&W TVs, if they could afford one. \n\nIn terms of productivity, the West is willing by a huge margin. It is really hard to motivate yourself to work hard and be creative when you have low fixed wages, no one cares if you do the bare minimum, it is hard to get promoted, it is hard to get fired, and everything is planned up to your death. Pretty much everyone\u2019s life is planned before you leave school. \n\nDid I mention USSR people are generally a lot poorer than US.

The Soviets simply couldn't keep pace economically or technologically with the West.\n\nI can't think of anything that realistically could have changed that dynamic.\n\nPerhaps if the Soviets had tried to transition in the early 1960's to what Gorbachev would later call \"the Swedish Model\" the might have been able to follow a more sustainable path.
