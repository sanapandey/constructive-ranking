So what's the point if the thing protecting your screen, which you look at everyday, always looks like shit. It boggles my mind that so many people have bought into this horse shit idea of a product. Its almost like you need a screen protector for the screen protector. Whereas my actual screen is way more resistant to scratching than a screen protector and the display looks way better and vibrant without. Just be careful not to treat your phone like a 3 year old would and you will be ok.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I do recommend getting a sleek phone case to protect against dropping your phone and breaking it that way. But the screen surface, i recommend just leaving it bare.",
