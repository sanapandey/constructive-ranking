The email link on their site doesn\u2019t seem to function, and I haven\u2019t gotten a reply to emails I sent over a month ago. Has anyone managed to get in touch with them successfully, or does anyone know an alternative way to reach out? I\u2019d really appreciate any tips on how to proceed. Thanks!",

I\u2019ve been trying to reach them for a refund for two months now, and with their email link not working and no replies, I\u2019m just so frustrated, I don\u2019t get why they\u2019re handling it like this. I really just want this to be over. Appreciate the advice",
